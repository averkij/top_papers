Introduction 6 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 5 2 0 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard querycritical information. Although runtime memory utilization is natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost tradeoff. In this work, we present BudgetMem, runtime agent memory framework for explicit, queryaware performancecost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., LOW/MID/HIGH). lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracycost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

February 6, 2026. 1 Memory has become core component of modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents, enabling them to retain and reuse information beyond single context window for long-horizon interaction, personalization, and knowledgeintensive reasoning (Hu et al., 2025). Nevertheless, most prior work centers on offline, query-agnostic memory construction, where past context is preprocessed, compressed, or indexed in fixed manner without conditioning on the downstream query (Kang et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025; Packer et al., 2023; Chhikara et al., 2025). This build once, use always paradigm can be wasteful and brittle: it spends computation regardless of what particular query needs, while potentially omitting crucial information for specific queries. Instead, an intuitive alternative is on-demand memory extraction, where computation is triggered at runtime based on the current query. This flexibility comes at cost: it pushes memory processing to runtime, making cost and latency first-class concerns. In practice, industrial LLM systems increasingly provide explicit, often tiered compute controls (e.g., thinking modes (Singh et al., 2025), reasoning levels (OpenAI, 2025), or heavier-model options (Anthropic, 2025)), reflecting the need to balance quality against runtime cost. This motivates key question for agent memory: how can we enable explicit and controllable performancecost trade-offs for runtime memory extraction? Unfortunately, enabling performance-cost trade-offs for runtime agent memory is fundamentally challenging. Most existing trade-off mechanisms operate offline, while ondemand memory pushes these decisions to runtime, where each query raises quality-cost choice. This exposes two core questions. First, where should budgets be applied? Existing systems often treat memory as monolithic pipeline with fixed compute setting, making trade-offs coarse and difficult to control (Kang et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2024). This motivates defining an appropriate budgeting unit for runtime settings, i.e., which modular part(s) of the memory extraction process should be assigned budgets, so that computation can be controlled in targeted and effective way. Second, how should budgets be realized? Prior work provides little systematic guidance on trade-offs for runLearning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory time memory, often resorting to ad hoc cost reduction or simply increasing compute (Yan et al., 2025a). As result, even after budgeting scheme is specified, it remains unclear how to operationalize budget control, which design axes best capture meaningful trade-offs, and how these choices behave across different budget regimes. Addressing these questions requires moving beyond one-off heuristics or compute-heavy escalation toward more systematic view of performancecost control for runtime agent memory. To address the above challenges, we propose BudgetMem, runtime agent memory framework that enables explicit, controllable performancecost trade-offs for on-demand memory extraction. BudgetMem views runtime memory extraction as multi-stage modular pipeline and makes computation controllable at the module level. Specifically, BudgetMem standardizes how each module is invoked by exposing common budget-tier interface, so that learned router can select among budget tiers within modules while keeping the overall extraction structure fixed. Building on this modular backbone, BudgetMem provides three budget tiers (i.e., LOW/MID/HIGH) for each module, offering different quality-cost trade-offs. We instantiate budget tiers through three complementary tiering strategies: implementation tiering (varying the module implementation), reasoning tiering (varying inference behavior), and capacity tiering (varying the modules model capacity). To navigate these tiered choices, BudgetMem employs shared lightweight router that performs budget-tier routing as the query is processed: at each module, it selects tier based on the available context (i.e., the query and intermediate module states). We train the router with reinforcement learning under cost-aware reward that trades off task performance against memory extraction cost, forming controllable performancecost behavior. This design yields practical and controllable runt"

Text:"Weak-Driven Learning: How Weak Agents make Strong Agents Stronger Zehao Chen * 1 2 Gongxun Li * 1 2 Tianxiang Ai * 2 Yifei Li 1 2 Zixuan Huang 1 Wang Zhou 2 Tao Huang 2 Fuzhen Zhuang 1 Xianglong Liu 1 Jianxin Li 1 Deqing Wang 1 Yikun Ban 1 6 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 2 2 2 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract As post-training optimization becomes central to improving large language models, we observe persistent saturation bottleneck: once models grow highly confident, further training yields diminishing returns. While existing methods continue to reinforce target predictions, we find that informative supervision signals remain latent in models own historical weak states. Motivated by this observation, we propose WMSS (Weak Agents Can Make Strong Agents Stronger), post-training paradigm that leverages weak checkpoints to guide continued optimization. By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation datasets show that agents trained with our approach achieve effective performance improvements, while incurring zero additional inference cost. Code is available at https://github. com/chenzehao82/Weak-Driven-Learning.git. 1. Introduction The dominant post-training paradigms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), Knowledge Distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015; Gou et al., 2021; Agarwal et al., 2023), and Curriculum Learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2023), share common principle: learning from stronger supervision signals. These approaches rely on mimicking objective, training models to approximate high-quality labels or the outputs of stronger teacher, under the assumption that closer alignment leads to improved performance. *Equal contribution Corresponding Author 1Beihang University 2China Teleco"

Text:"6 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 6 9 7 7 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Thinking Makes LLM Agents Introverted: How Mandatory Thinking Can Backfire in User-Engaged Agents Jiatong Li1, Changdae Oh1, Hyeong Kyu Choi1, Jindong Wang2 and Sharon Li1 1University of WisconsinMadison, 2William & Mary Abstract Eliciting reasoning has emerged as powerful technique for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks by inducing thinking. However, their effectiveness in realistic user-engaged agent scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive study on the effect of explicit thinking in user-engaged LLM agents. Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more introverted by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is vital lever for agent optimization. Overall, our study suggests that information transparency awareness is crucial yet underexplored perspective for the future design of reasoning agents in real-world scenarios.

BudgetMem is a runtime memory framework for LLM agents that uses modular components with three budget tiers and a neural policy router to optimize performance-cost trade-offs in memory usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., Low/Mid/High). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

WMSS is a post-training paradigm that uses weak model checkpoints to identify and fill learning gaps, enabling continued improvement beyond conventional saturation points in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 As post-training optimization becomes central to improving large language models, we observe a persistent saturation bottleneck: once models grow highly confident, further training yields diminishing returns. While existing methods continue to reinforce target predictions, we find that informative supervision signals remain latent in models' own historical weak states. Motivated by this observation, we propose WMSS (Weak Agents Can Make Strong Agents Stronger), a post-training paradigm that leverages weak checkpoints to guide continued optimization. By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation datasets show that agents trained with our approach achieve effective performance improvements, while incurring zero additional inference cost.

A new benchmark and evaluation metric are introduced for assessing temporal coherence and dynamic interaction in GUI generation models, revealing significant challenges in maintaining consistency over extended interaction sequences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments. The code is available at: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/GEBench.

"A new benchmark and evaluation metric are introduced for assessing temporal coherence and dynamic interaction in GUI generation models, revealing significant challenges in maintaining consistency over extended interaction sequences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments. The code is available at: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/GEBench."

Current multimodal foundation models show limitations in maintaining coherent spatial beliefs during active exploration, exhibiting gaps between active and passive performance, inefficient exploration strategies, and difficulties in updating outdated spatial knowledge.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spatial embodied intelligence requires agents to act to acquire information under partial observability. While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration.

MotionCrafter is a video diffusion framework that jointly reconstructs 4D geometry and estimates dense motion using a novel joint representation and 4D VAE architecture.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce MotionCrafter, a video diffusion-based framework that jointly reconstructs 4D geometry and estimates dense motion from a monocular video. The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

Explicit reasoning in LLM agents can degrade performance in user-engaged scenarios by reducing information disclosure and weakening agent-user communication, with transparency-aware prompting showing better results.  					AI-generated summary 				 Eliciting reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks by inducing thinking. However, their effectiveness in realistic user-engaged agent scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of explicit thinking in user-engaged LLM agents. Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization. Overall, our study suggests that information transparency awareness is a crucial yet underexplored perspective for the future design of reasoning agents in real-world scenarios.

A benchmark and optimization technique are presented to improve multimodal large language models' emotion understanding by addressing spurious associations and hallucinations in audiovisual cues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings. By providing both a rigorous benchmark and a robust optimization framework, this work enables principled evaluation and improvement of MLLMs for emotion understanding and social AI. Code, models and benchmark will be released at https://avere-iclr.github.io.

"A benchmark and optimization technique are presented to improve multimodal large language models' emotion understanding by addressing spurious associations and hallucinations in audiovisual cues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings. By providing both a rigorous benchmark and a robust optimization framework, this work enables principled evaluation and improvement of MLLMs for emotion understanding and social AI. Code, models and benchmark will be released at https://avere-iclr.github.io."
