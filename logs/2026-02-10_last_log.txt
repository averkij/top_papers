Text:"Jiangnan Ye 1 Hanqi Yan 1 Zhenyi Shen 1 Heng Chang 2 Ye Mao 3 Yulan He 1 4 Abstract Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing keyvalue caches, motivating In this work, we study context compression. soft context compression, where long context is condensed into small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically repurpose the LLM itself as trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the models internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into small number of slots via globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only 1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust longcontext compression. 6 2 0 2 3 ] .

Email: duygu@turkish-nlp-suite.com Abstract Tokenization is pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes, but they typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizers training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics of segmentation quality, and (iii) evaluate narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first and only comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization subwords manifest that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (datavocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology-level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro-F1 over gold morpheme boundaries, decoupled lemma atomicity vssurface boundary hits, over-/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) systematic investigation of the vocabularycorpussuccess triad for Turkish, including larger data regimes than prior work; (ii) unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) extensive, controlled comparisons that identify "

Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE (KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient datasetlevel, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development. Large language models (LLMs) adopt the Transformer architecture [1] and generate text autoregressively under causal mask, which ensures that past key and value vectors can be cached (KV-cache) [2].

[ 1 9 2 6 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aCausal discovery is essential for advancing datadriven fields such as scientific AI and data analysis, yet existing approaches face significant timeand space-efficiency bottlenecks when scaling to large graphs. To address this challenge, we present CauScale, neural architecture designed for efficient causal discovery that scales inference to graphs with up to 1000 nodes. CauScale improves time efficiency via reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts two-stream design: data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on indistribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 413,000 inference speedups over prior methods. Our project page is at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CauScale. 1. Introduction Causal discovery aims at uncovering causal relationships and mechanisms from observational data (Spirtes et al., 2000; Pearl, 2009; Glymour et al., 2019). central component of causal discovery is causal structure learning, which identifies the underlying structural causal models (SCMs) and learns directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edges represent direct causal relationships between variables (Peters et al., 2017). The inference of causal relationships is an 1Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory 2Shanghai Innovation Institute 3Shanghai Jiao Tong University 4Tongji University. Correspondence to: Chaochao Lu <luchaochao@pjlab.org.cn>. 1 important problem across many fields including bioinformatics (Sachs et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2013), epidemiology (Vandenbroucke et al., 2016), and economics (Hicks et al., 1980). As data grow increasingly complex, discovering causal relationships from massive datasets has become an urgent challenge. However, existing causal discovery algorithms face major timeand space-efficiency bottlenecks, particularly when scaling to large graphs. Constraint-based algorithms (e.g., PC and FCI (Spirtes et al., 2000)) can become time-prohibitive because they rely on large numbers of conditional-independence tests, whose count grows exponentially in the worst case. In contrast, score-based methods such as NOTEARS (Zheng et al., 2018) and RL-BIC (Zhu et al., 2019) avoid explicit combinatorial search but typically require solving fresh continuous optimization problem for each dataset, which remains computationally expensive at scale. To reduce runtime, AVICI (Lorch et al., 2022) amortizes causal discovery by pretraining supervised model on simulated data and performing zero-shot graph prediction at test time. However, its attention mechanism scales unfavorably with the number of variables, often leading to substantial memory pressure on large graphs. To overcome these timeand space-efficiency bottlenecks, we propose CauScale, an efficient neural architecture for causal discovery. Overall, CauScale adopts two-stream design with data stream and graph stream. For time efficiency, we introduce reduction unit that compresses the data embeddings during network processing. For space efficiency, we adopt tied attention weights (Rao et al., 2021) in both streams: sharing attention weights across axis avoids maintaining axis-specific attention maps and substantially reduces the memory footprint of attention. To improve efficiency without sacrificing discovery quality, we further design data-graph block that (i) injects graph-prior information and (ii) mitigates information loss from data reduction. Specifically, it distills relational evidence from high-dimensional data into graph message to guide representation learning in the graph stream. Moreover, it fuses the two streams by injecting the data stream into the graph embedding before reduction, so that the model preserves key relational signals and alleviates information loss. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and singleCauScale: Neural Causal Discovery at Scale cell expression datasets with varying sizes and causal structures. The results demonstrate that CauScale achieves superior accuracy with markedly improved efficiency. Specifically, CauScale achieves an mAP of 99.6% on indistribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution (OOD) It stand out as the fastest method, outperforming data. previous approaches by 4 to 13,000. Furthermore, during training, CauScale scales successfully to 500-node graphs, setting where AVICI fails due to limited memory and excessive space costs. In summary, our contributions are: We present one of the first studies on pre-training neural networks for efficient causal discovery at scale, offering scalable step toward uncovering causal relations from increasingly complex data. We introduce CauScale, neural architecture that jointly improves time and memory efficiency with high causal discovery accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of CauScale across varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, demonstrating that CauScale improves both efficiency and causal discovery performance. 2. Related Work Existing causal structure learning methods can be broadly categorized into non-amortized and amortized (zero-shot) approaches, relying on whether inference on new dataset requires solving dataset-specific optimization problem. Non-amortized causal discovery. Non-amortized methods perform causal discovery by solving an optimization or search problem independently for each dataset, leading to high computational cost and limited scalability. 1) Constraint-based algorithms, such as PC and FCI (Spirtes et al., 2000), infer graph structures via conditional independence tests but suffer from exponential complexity as the number of variables grows. 2) Score-based algorithms optimize predefined score over the space of graph structures (Tsamardinos et al., 2006; Goudet et al., 2017). Classical approaches rely on greedy combinatorial search, including GES (Chickering, 2002) and GIES (Hauser"

[ 2 6 4 9 5 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Rajdeep Haldar 1 Lantao Mei Guang Lin 1 Yue Xing 2 Qifan SongRecent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose -Group Relative Policy Optimization (f -GRPO), class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and -Hybrid Alignment Loss (f -HAL), hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of -divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods. 1. Introduction Alignment is the final stage in the training pipeline of large language models (LLMs), aimed at instilling capabilities beyond language comprehension and instruction-following that are learned during pretraining and instruction finetuning (Ouyang et al., 2022). These capabilities range from complex reasoning, such as coding or math problem-solving (Shao et al., 2024), to the adherence to safety and ethical constraints based on human preferences (Bai et al., 2022b). In practice, alignment is achieved via reinforcement learning (RL) using reward signal that encodes the target behavior. While various RL-based alignment strategies have been developed, they differ mainly in the source of the reward signal. In general, they can be categorized into two regimes: 1Department of Statistics, Purdue University 2Department of Statistics, Michigan State University. Correspondence to: Rajdeep Haldar <rhaldar@purdue.edu>. Preprint. February 10, 2026. 1 (i) In the verifiable reward regime (RLVR), one has access to an explicit reward function that quantitatively evaluates the correctness or quality of response, as in tasks such as mathematical reasoning (Guo et al., 2025), code generation (Le et al., 2022), tool use (Jiang et al., 2025), etc. Learning in this regime is naturally formulated using an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that samples from the current policy, evaluates responses based on the reward, and updates the model accordingly. Among on-policy algorithms, GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) stands out for its computational efficiency and superior performance. (ii) In the preference alignment regime (PA), reward signal is provided implicitly through relative comparisons or binary feedback between responses (e.g., safe vs. unsafe, preferred vs. rejected). Alignment can then be performed either by training reward model followed by on-policy learning, commonly referred to as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), or by using direct alignment methods that optimize the policy directly via supervised objective on preference data (Off-Policy). Further details for these two regimes are provided in 2.2 and 2.3. Divergence Perspective for Preference Alignment Haldar et al. (2025) proposed unifying framework for preference alignment that interprets popular PA methods as instances of divergence estimators between an aligned (D+, chosen) and unaligned (D, rejected) distributions, differentiated by the choice of divergences. In principle, one can construct new preference alignment methods given choice of divergence, resulting in class of direct, off-policy alignment objectives for any general -divergence; refer to 2.3.1 for details. natural question then arises: Can this divergence-based viewpoint for PA be extended beyond preference alignment to the verifiable reward regime (RLVR)? In other words, can divergence estimation serve as unifying foundation for both off-policy preference alignment and on-policy reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards? This work addresses this question by extending the divergence framework to construct general on-policy and hybrid RL objectives (Figure 1 summarizes our framework). In particular, our contribution is three-fold: Divergence-Based RL for General LLM Alignment vs. below-average reward Figure 1. Divergence Estimation Framework. RLVR (left): verifiable reward signal r(x, y) induces reward-aligned/unaligned distributions (above D+ under the old policy), and -GRPO performs on-policy alignment by estimating an -divergence between these distributions. Preference alignment (right): preference data samples chosen and rejected prompt-response pairs from aligned (D+) and unaligned (D) distributions, and direct aligners (e.g., FDO) optimize the variational -divergence objective between (D+, D). Hybrid (bottom): -HAL combines both information sources, interpolating between off-policy preference alignment and on-policy RLVR. Divergence-based RL objectives. We introduce -GRPO (Equation (15)), class of on-policy alignment objectives, and -HAL (Equation (16)), class of hybrid objectives that combine on-policy RL with preference-based supervision, both derived from general -divergences. Theoretical characterization and guarantees. We show that -GRPO and -HAL are divergence estimators: - GRPO estimates divergence between above-average and below-average reward distributions, while -HAL estimates divergence between mixtures of reward-based and preference-based aligned/unaligned distributions. We further establish Alignment Consistency and guarantee an improvement in the expected reward after alignment (Theorem 4.3). Furthermore, we justify the expected improvement of -GRPO over GRPO (4.1). Empirical validation across alignment regimes. We empirically validate our theoretical framework in 5. In particular, we examine the performance of -GRPO in both regimes and validate -HAL in the PA regime given the potential reward hacking in this regime. Experiment results demonstrate enhancement. 2. Preliminary 2.1. Notation Our notation follows (Haldar et al., 2025). Let denote the prompt and represent response. We use yw and yl to indicate aligned and unaligned responses, with flexible contexts depending on the regime (high reward, preferred) or (low reward, unpreferred).

ComprExIT introduces a novel approach to long-context inference in LLMs by using explicit information transmission over frozen hidden states, improving compression efficiency through depth-wise and width-wise transmission mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing key-value caches, motivating context compression. In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information.

"ComprExIT introduces a novel approach to long-context inference in LLMs by using explicit information transmission over frozen hidden states, improving compression efficiency through depth-wise and width-wise transmission mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing key-value caches, motivating context compression. In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations.

A comprehensive study of Turkish subword tokenization systematically investigates the relationship between vocabulary size, training corpus, and tokenizer performance across multiple linguistic tasks and diagnostics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a "subwords manifest", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this "subwords manifest" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.

KV-CoRE method evaluates kv-cache compressibility through SVD-based low-rank approximation, revealing patterns linking compressibility to model architecture and training data across multiple languages and domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

CauScale is a neural architecture that enables efficient causal discovery on large graphs through compressed embeddings and tied attention weights, achieving high accuracy and significant speedups over previous methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Causal discovery is essential for advancing data-driven fields such as scientific AI and data analysis, yet existing approaches face significant time- and space-efficiency bottlenecks when scaling to large graphs. To address this challenge, we present CauScale, a neural architecture designed for efficient causal discovery that scales inference to graphs with up to 1000 nodes. CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

Preference alignment objectives are extended to general alignment settings using f-divergence variational representations, introducing novel on-policy and hybrid policy optimization methods for LLM alignment with theoretical and empirical validation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of f-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

"Preference alignment objectives are extended to general alignment settings using f-divergence variational representations, introducing novel on-policy and hybrid policy optimization methods for LLM alignment with theoretical and empirical validation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of f-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods."

CE-RAG4EM reduces computational overhead in large-scale entity matching by implementing blocking-based batch retrieval and generation while maintaining competitive matching quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLM reasoning in knowledge-intensive tasks, but existing RAG pipelines incur substantial retrieval and generation overhead when applied to large-scale entity matching. To address this limitation, we introduce CE-RAG4EM, a cost-efficient RAG architecture that reduces computation through blocking-based batch retrieval and generation. We also present a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating RAG systems for entity matching, focusing on blocking-aware optimizations and retrieval granularity. Extensive experiments suggest that CE-RAG4EM can achieve comparable or improved matching quality while substantially reducing end-to-end runtime relative to strong baselines. Our analysis further reveals that key configuration parameters introduce an inherent trade-off between performance and overhead, offering practical guidance for designing efficient and scalable RAG systems for entity matching and data integration.
