Analysis of agentic system evaluation reveals significant variance in single-run performance estimates, necessitating multiple runs and advanced metrics for reliable assessment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic systems are evaluated on benchmarks where agents interact with environments to solve tasks. Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise.

Они обнаружили значительную дисперсию в метрике pass@1, вычисленной по одному прогону: оценки варьируются на 2,2-6,0 процентных пункта в зависимости от выбранного прогона. Авторы показывают, что траектории агентов расходятся на ранних этапах, и малые различия в токенах приводят к разным стратегиям решения. Они рекомендуют использовать несколько независимых прогонов, статистический анализ мощности и альтернативные метрики вроде pass@k и pass^k для надёжной оценки прогресса агентных систем.",

"Analysis of agentic system evaluation reveals significant variance in single-run performance estimates, necessitating multiple runs and advanced metrics for reliable assessment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic systems are evaluated on benchmarks where agents interact with environments to solve tasks. Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise."

The paper focuses on evaluation methodology and statistical reliability of agentic system performance assessment, which relates to optimization of evaluation practices and understanding performance metrics. However, while the paper discusses agentic systems, it does not substantively address AGI concepts, alignment, reasoning enhancement, or other listed topics. The core contribution is about improving evaluation methodology through multiple runs and statistical analysis rather than advancing the capabilities or alignment of these systems.
