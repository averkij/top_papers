Text:"6 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 5 1 3 3 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Why LLMs Arent Scientists Yet: Lessons from Four Autonomous Research Attempts {dhruv.trehan, paras}@lossfunk.com January 2026 Abstract We report case study of four end-to-end attempts to autonomously generate ML research papers using pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow. Of these four, three attempts failed during implementation or evaluation. One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design. We conclude by discussing four design principles for more robust AI-scientist systems, implications for autonomous scientific discovery, and we release all prompts, artifacts, and outputs at https://github.com/Lossfunk/ai-scientist-artefacts-v1. The question we set out with was: could state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs go from research idea to research paper with high degree of autonomy, minimal code scaffolding, and the most basic tools? Various AI Scientist systems proposed in research papers already relied on high 1 degree of domain-specific pre-definition of the workflow or framing the problem statement in system-specific way. Tree-search systems like Sakanas [1] would have required complex metaorchestration, contradicting our minimal scaffolding goal. Similarly, Googles AlphaEvolve system [2] requires clear verification metric defined by human expert in advance. We were interested in exploring how far current LLMs can go without significant scaffolding In line with this, we limited our scope to computational sciences, or inputs"

Gen3R combines foundational reconstruction models with video diffusion models to generate 3D scenes with RGB videos and geometric information through aligned latents.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

"Gen3R combines foundational reconstruction models with video diffusion models to generate 3D scenes with RGB videos and geometric information through aligned latents.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models."
