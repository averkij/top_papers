Pearmut is a platform that simplifies human evaluation in multilingual NLP by providing a lightweight solution for end-to-end evaluation with support for various protocols and learning strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human evaluation is the gold standard for multilingual NLP, but is often skipped in practice and substituted with automatic metrics, because it is notoriously complex and slow to set up with existing tools with substantial engineering and operational overhead. We introduce Pearmut, a lightweight yet feature-rich platform that makes end-to-end human evaluation as easy to run as automatic evaluation. Pearmut removes common entry barriers and provides support for evaluating multilingual tasks, with a particular focus on machine translation. The platform implements standard evaluation protocols, including DA, ESA, or MQM, but is also extensible to allow prototyping new protocols. It features document-level context, absolute and contrastive evaluation, attention checks, ESAAI pre-annotations and both static and active learning-based assignment strategies. Pearmut enables reliable human evaluation to become a practical, routine component of model development and diagnosis rather than an occasional effort.

A novel 1D visual tokenizer called Residual Tokenizer is introduced that incorporates hierarchical residuals to improve autoregressive image generation by leveraging vision-specific design principles rather than language modeling approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps. Code is available at https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/ResTok.

Токенизатор строит иерархические остатки как для токенов изображения, так и для скрытых токенов, обеспечивая кросс-уровневое слияние признаков и более концентрированные распределения.

**Reasoning:** The paper introduces a novel visual tokenizer (Residual Tokenizer) designed to improve autoregressive image generation efficiency and effectiveness. The core contribution focuses on optimizing the tokenization and generation process through hierarchical residual designs and reducing sampling steps, which are optimization-related improvements to model training and inference. While the paper involves generative models and vision, it primarily addresses optimization of the generation pipeline rather than fitting other listed topics like DIFFUSION (which focuses on diffusion-based models), SURVEY, or other categories.
