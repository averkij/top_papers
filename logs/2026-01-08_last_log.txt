Programmatic Skill Network enables continual skill acquisition through executable symbolic programs that evolve via reflection, progressive optimization, and structural refactoring mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

**Justification:**

- **AGENTS**: The paper explicitly studies "continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills." This is directly about agent-based architectures and autonomous agent capabilities.

- **ROBOTICS**: The paper focuses on "embodied environments" and tests on MineDojo and Crafter, which are embodied AI/robotics simulation environments where agents learn to perform tasks.

- **TRAINING**: The paper proposes mechanisms for improving how agents learn and refine skills over time, including "progressive optimization," "maturity-aware update gating," and discusses "learning dynamics," which are core training methodology contributions.

"Programmatic Skill Network enables continual skill acquisition through executable symbolic programs that evolve via reflection, progressive optimization, and structural refactoring mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code."

["REASONING", "OPEN_SOURCE"]
```

**Justification:**

1. **REASONING**: The paper focuses on continual skill acquisition through structured fault localization (REFLECT mechanism), progressive optimization, and refactoring. These mechanisms enable the agent to construct logical reasoning about skill compositions and improve them through reflection and optimization - core aspects of enhancing logical reasoning capabilities.

2. **OPEN_SOURCE**: The paper explicitly states "We plan to open-source the code," indicating a commitment to releasing code/framework to the public.
