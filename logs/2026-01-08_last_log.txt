Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning addresses catastrophic forgetting in supervised fine-tuning by using token-level entropy to distinguish uncertainty from knowledge conflict, enabling better preservation of general capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the standard paradigm for domain adaptation, yet it frequently incurs the cost of catastrophic forgetting. In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as "Confident Conflicts" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.

**Justification:**

- **TRAINING**: The paper is fundamentally about improving model fine-tuning methods. It proposes Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT) as a novel approach to address catastrophic forgetting during supervised fine-tuning, which is a core training methodology improvement.

- **RLHF**: While the paper focuses on supervised fine-tuning, it explicitly compares SFT with on-policy reinforcement learning and uses insights from RL to inform the fine-tuning approach. The paper discusses how RL preserves general capabilities better than SFT and uses this comparison to motivate the proposed method, making it relevant to the RLHF category which encompasses human feedback and alignment techniques in RL contexts.

Researchers developed Benchmark^2, a framework with three metrics to evaluate benchmark quality for large language models, revealing significant variations in existing benchmarks and enabling more efficient evaluation through selective benchmark construction.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

Фреймворк включает три метрики: согласованность ранжирования моделей между бенчмарками, способность различать производительность разных моделей и выявление аномалий, когда более слабые модели показывают лучший результат, чем сильные. На основе анализа 15 бенчмарков и 11 LLM-моделей авторы выявили значительные различия в качестве существующих тестовых наборов. Результаты показывают, что целенаправленный отбор бенчмарков на основе предложенных метрик позволяет достичь аналогичной оценивающей способности с использованием значительно меньшего количества тестов.",

"Researchers developed Benchmark^2, a framework with three metrics to evaluate benchmark quality for large language models, revealing significant variations in existing benchmarks and enabling more efficient evaluation through selective benchmark construction.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets."

**Reasoning:** The paper proposes Benchmark², a framework for evaluating and improving the quality of LLM benchmarks through metrics that enable more efficient evaluation. This directly relates to OPTIMIZATION as it focuses on optimizing the benchmark evaluation process itself - specifically through "selective benchmark construction" that achieves "comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets," which is an optimization of computational resources and evaluation efficiency.

EpiQAL presents a novel benchmark for evaluating epidemiological reasoning in language models through three distinct subsets measuring factual recall, multi-step inference, and conclusion reconstruction from scientific literature.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

Исследования десяти открытых LLM показали, что современные языковые модели демонстрируют ограниченную производительность в эпидемиологическом рассуждении, при этом многошаговый вывод представляет наибольшую сложность. Результаты подтвердили, что масштаб модели не гарантирует успех в этой задаче, а Chain-of-Thought промптинг дает неоднозначные результаты в разных подмножествах.",
