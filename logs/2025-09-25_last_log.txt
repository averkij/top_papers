[ 1 0 9 9 6 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT In this paper, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based method for training Speech-Aware Large Language Models (SALLMs) on open-format speech understanding tasks, such as Spoken Question Answering and Automatic Speech Translation. SALLMs have proven highly effective for speech understanding tasks. GRPO has recently gained traction for its efficiency in training LLMs, and prior work has explored its application to SALLMs, primarily in multiple-choice tasks. Building on this, we focus on openformat tasks that better reflect the generative abilities of the models. Our approach leverages GRPO with BLEU as the reward signal to optimize SALLMs, and we demonstrate empirically that it surpasses standard SFT across several key metrics. Finally, we explore the potential of incorporating offpolicy samples within GRPO for these tasks, highlighting avenues for further improvement and further research.

INTRODUCTION Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained significant traction, due to its effectiveness in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and VLMs [1, 2]. Inspired by the advancements in Multi-Modal RL, we aim to improve Speech-Aware Large Language Models (SALLMs) [3]. SALLMs process spoken language by taking combined speech-and-text inputs and generating text outputs. They are widely used for tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automatic Speech Translation (AST), and Spoken Question Answering (SQA) [4, 5]. Recent works have applied RL to SALLMs, typically for SQA, yet these approaches often rely on binary rewards, which constrain the models ability to provide open-ended answers [6, 7]. Other works use unsupervised methods for reward calculation [8], but these often yield subpar results compared to standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work: we propose an RL approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve SALLMs. Our method leverages the GRPO algorithm [1] and uses the BLEU metric (or other *Work done during internship at IBM Research metrics) [9] as reward signal. We evaluate our approach on speech understanding tasks SQA and AST. Our approach demonstrates strong performance on open-ended responses, yielding superior results to standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as well as the baseline model. We show this empirically using standardized metrics such as BLEU [9], ROUGE [10], METEOR [11], and BERTScore [12]. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose to train SALLMs by integrating GRPO with various reward functions. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard SFT on SQA and AST across multiple relevant metrics. We study the effectiveness of using off-policy samples as part of our proposed method. 2. RELATED WORK SALLMs have gained recent attention, driven by their potential in speech understanding tasks such as ASR, AST, and SQA. These models leverage speech encoder, language model, and train lightweight projector to align the two modalities. Leading models such as [4, 5] are trained on extensive speech datasets to improve their capabilities. Unlike Speech Language Models (SLMs) [14, 15] which take speech as input and output speech, SALLMs take speech as input but output only text, which makes them more appropriate for chat-oriented tasks. Reinforcement Learning methods have been used to improve the capabilities of LLMs. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [16] was used to help LLMs learn from human feedback [17], but requires training reward model and has high memory requirements. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) demonstrates that when preference response pairs are available, LLMs can be trained without reward [18]. GRPO is an on-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, learning from its own generated data. Instead of relying on value model, it updates the policy and obtains advantage estimates using an empirical normalization of the grouped samples (see Eq. 1). GRPO has been shown to produce SOTA results in reasoning tasks such as math and coding [1]. Table 1. Results on LibriSQA (SQA). SOTA results are taken from LibriSQA paper [13].
