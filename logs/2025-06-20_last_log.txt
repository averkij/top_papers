Text:"Revisiting Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning from Cross-Domain Perspective Zhoujun Cheng1,*, Shibo Hao1,*, Tianyang Liu1,* Fan Zhou2, Yutao Xie1, Feng Yao1, Yuexin Bian1, Yonghao Zhuang3, Nilabjo Dey4 Yuheng Zha1, Yi Gu1, Kun Zhou1, Yuqi Wang2, Yuan Li3, Richard Fan2, Jianshu She2 Chengqian Gao2, Abulhair Saparov4, Haonan Li2, Taylor W. Killian2, Mikhail Yurochkin2 Zhengzhong Liu2, Eric P. Xing2,3, Zhiting Hu1 1UC San Diego, 2MBZUAI, 3Carnegie Mellon University, 4Purdue University *Equal Contribution Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce GURU, curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domainsMath, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabulareach built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on GURU, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present GURU-7B/32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite acro"
