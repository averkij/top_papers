Nori 1 Rahul Sharma 2 Amit Sharma 2 Javier GonzalezRecent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE: framework to characterize hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside scalable pipeline to generate problem variations across all the levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. The framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate the type of insights that RE-IMAGINE can generate on four widely-used benchmarks, which we use to evaluate reasoning on several families of LLMs. We observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have sparked increasing interest in the development of reasoning systems. Central to this goal are Large Language Models (LLMs) models like OpenAIs o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), o3 (OpenAI, 2024), or DeepSeek-R1 (Team, 2025) show complex problem-solving abilities, and demonstrate unprece- *Equal contribution 1Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK 2Microsoft Research India, Correspondence to: Xinnuo Xu <xinnuoxu@microsoft.com>, Rachel Lawrence <rachel.lawrence@microsoft.com>.

With growing reliance on LLMs across wide-ranging applications, it is increasingly important to clarify the strengths and limitations of these apparent reasoning abilities. Reasoning is cognitive process. It involves using facts or premises to make inferences about conclusions or judgments (Holyoak & Morrison, 2005). In the realm of LLMs and AI, reasoning is understood to be the ability of model to demonstrate logically correct systematic processes that surpass mere statistical pattern recognition in the training set (Gonzalez & Nori, 2024). Traditionally, the evaluation of reasoning in LLMs has been focused on their performance across fixed benchmarks in domains such as math (Cobbe et al., 2021), programming (Wu et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024), real-world logic (Jin et al., 2023a) and others (Wang et al., 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2022). However, debate persists on whether the observed results occur from genuine reasoning or from mere statistical recall of training data (Mitchell & Krakauer, 2023) particularly for training data which, in the case of published benchmarks, may have information leakage from the test set (Zhou et al., 2023). Defining principled ways to make this distinction is crucial for advancing AI and controlling potential hazards and risks (Weidinger et al., 2021). Recently, several surveys have explored how to evaluate reasoning beyond memorization in LLMs (Xu et al., 2025; Huang & Chang, 2023). In general, two main approaches have emerged. One aims to develop novel reasoning tasks such as mystery blocksworld (Webb et al., 2024), ARCAGI (Chollet et al., 2025), and others (Zhu et al., 2023). An alternative is to create novel variations of existing benchmarks, e.g. for math (Mirzadeh et al., 2024; Srivastava et al., 2024), analogies (Lewis & Mitchell, 2024), and diverse tasks across code, math, and logic (Wu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). common strategy for creating such variations involves leveraging symbolic representations of problems such as functional templates (Mirzadeh et al., 2024; Srivastava et al., 2024), reasoning or causal graphs (Gonzalez & Nori, 2024; Huyuk et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), planning tasks (Valmeekam et al., 2022) or code (Li et al., 2024). RE-IMAGINE: Symbolic Benchmark Synthesis for Reasoning Evaluation Level Description Examples Evaluation metric(s) 1. Observe Original problem. 2. Mutate 3. Imagine Mutated problem by replacing or adding components. Original problem augmented with an imagine statement, modifying the original statements or assertions before it.

Task performance (original). Task performance (original and mutated). Task performance (original and augmented) PN and PS (only in counterfactuals). References Cobbe et al. (2021) Jin et al.

Hierarchy of problem variations introduced in the RE-IMAGINE framework to evaluate LLMs. Level-1 (observe) captures the accuracy of LLMs to solve problems in existing benchmarks. These benchmarks may have been observed by the LLMs in current or similar form. Level-2 (mutate) captures the ability to solve problem variations. Level-3 (imagine) captures the ability to correctly incorporate new logic into existing problems, even when this logic contradicts the original components. In certain cases, the new logic can be understood as counterfactual statement (Pearl, 2009). Despite the introduction of various benchmark variations aimed at assessing LLMs reasoning abilities, these variations have been developed in an ad hoc manner, lacking systematic hierarchy. Moreover, most existing approaches rely on significant manual effort and are designed for specific tasks, making them difficult to scale across multiple benchmarks and tasks. For instance, in Mirzadeh et al. (2024); Srivastava et al. (2024), functional templates for simple math pr"
