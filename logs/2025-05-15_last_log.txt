INTRODUCTION HE introduction of ImageNet [1] laid the foundation for training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as AlexNet [2], catalyzing further advances in the computer vision field: in data acquisition, neural architectures, and training techniques. With the advent of VGG [3] and ResNet [4] architectures, transfer learning [5] became essential for training high-performance computer vision models and reducing training time of semantic segmentation [6], depth prediction [7], and other downstream tasks. In many cases, training neural network from random weight initialization is 00000000/00$00.00 2021 IEEE IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE 2 claimed not feasible [6]. Modern deep learning frameworks [8] have since made it easy to use pretrained models by allowing practitioners to load pretrained weights with simple setting like pretrained=True during model creation. The rise of large text-to-image generative models [9] and denoising diffusion approaches [10], [11] has opened new opportunities for leveraging the rich priors embedded in foundational models. breakthrough in this area came with the introduction of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), class of models exemplified by the widely known Stable Diffusion (SD) [12]. These models operate in the compressed latent space of pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE), enabling significant resource savings in both training and inference. Trained on the internet-scale LAION-5B dataset of captioned images [13], Stable Diffusion excels in realism and diversity. Its open-source availability, low computational requirements for inference, and integration with toolkits like diffusers [14] have enabled widespread experimentation by researchers and artists. The abundance of customization recipes [15][17] has prompted many notable extensions that focus on enhancing the controllability of the original image generation task. Repurposing text-to-image LDMs from image generation to image analysis is recent development in generative imaging. The motivation is simple: if diffusion model demonstrates deep understanding of the visual world through high-quality image generation, that same understanding can be leveraged to derive versatile regression model for image analysis. To this end, in our recent work [18], we introduced MarigoldDepth, an LDM-based state-of-the-art zero-shot affine-invariant monocular depth estimator, along with simple and resourceefficient fine-tuning protocol for Stable Diffusion. Marigold-Depth proposed several key novelties unlocking the potential of LDMs for image understanding: (1) reusing the LDMs VAE to encode not just the input image but also the output modality into the latent space; (2) using only high-quality synthetic data; (3) short resource-efficient fine-tuning protocol; (4) generative modeling of conditional distribution rather than predicting its mode as end-to-end approaches do.these properties are organically entangled. (12): Encoding the modality into latent space is only possible when it is noise-free and pixel-complete rarely the case with the real depth ground truth. (23): short fine-tuning protocol preserves prior knowledge. It requires diverse, consistently labeled, and noise-free data to reduce noise in weight updates, which are satisfiable with synthetic data. (13): Operation in latent space ensures affordable fine-tuning and inference on single consumer Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), empowering research even outside large labs. The importance of synthetic data and strong prior for depth estimation have been subsequently confirmed in Depth Anything V2 [19]. Although their end-to-end model achieves impressive perfo"

Software issue localization, the task of identifying the precise code locations (files, classes, or functions) relevant to a natural language issue description (e.g., bug report, feature request), is a critical yet time-consuming aspect of software development. While recent LLM-based agentic approaches demonstrate promise, they often incur significant latency and cost due to complex multi-step reasoning and relying on closed-source LLMs. Alternatively, traditional code ranking models, typically optimized for query-to-code or code-to-code retrieval, struggle with the verbose and failure-descriptive nature of issue localization queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce SweRank, an efficient and effective retrieve-and-rerank framework for software issue localization. To facilitate training, we construct SweLoc, a large-scale dataset curated from public GitHub repositories, featuring real-world issue descriptions paired with corresponding code modifications. Empirical results on SWE-Bench-Lite and LocBench show that SweRank achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both prior ranking models and costly agent-based systems using closed-source LLMs like Claude-3.5. Further, we demonstrate SweLoc's utility in enhancing various existing retriever and reranker models for issue localization, establishing the dataset as a valuable resource for the community.

Авторы создали большой датасет SweLoc, содержащий описания реальных проблем и соответствующие изменения кода из репозиториев GitHub. Эмпирические результаты показывают, что SweRank превосходит как предыдущие модели ранжирования, так и дорогостоящие системы на основе агентов, использующие закрытые языковые модели. SweLoc также демонстрирует свою полезность для улучшения существующих моделей извлечения и переранжирования в задаче локализации проблем.",

"Software issue localization, the task of identifying the precise code locations (files, classes, or functions) relevant to a natural language issue description (e.g., bug report, feature request), is a critical yet time-consuming aspect of software development. While recent LLM-based agentic approaches demonstrate promise, they often incur significant latency and cost due to complex multi-step reasoning and relying on closed-source LLMs. Alternatively, traditional code ranking models, typically optimized for query-to-code or code-to-code retrieval, struggle with the verbose and failure-descriptive nature of issue localization queries.
