This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU benchmark. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance. Index TermsAudio Large Language Models (LLMs) I. INTRODUCTION Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been shown to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) [1]. We are motivated by these advancements to improve the capabilities of Audio LLMs - models which take in audio input and text and can perform tasks such as question answering. Building on Qwen2.5-Omni [2], Stateof-the-Art (SOTA) multi-modal LLM, we introduce OmniR1 using fine-tuning pipeline based on the RL method Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [3]. Using simple prompt, our model forgoes complex chain-of-thought or structured reasoning outputs and instead directly outputs answer choices. We use the recent MMAU [4] benchmark to test our models. Fine-tuning on the audio and human-annotated questions from the AVQA [5] dataset boosts Qwen2.5-Omnis average accuracy on MMAU Test-mini fro"

Comparison between the most important features of the publicly available datasets (ground-ground, aerial-aerial, and aerial-ground) and the DetReIDX dataset. Unlike its counterparts, DetReIDX includes clothing variations within subjects, with detection and tracking annotations, action labels, at wide altitude ranges (5.8m120m). model capacity but rather the lack of datasets that reflect the true operational complexity of drone-based surveillance: low resolution, cross-viewpoint domain gaps, long-range degradation, and appearance shifts due to clothing or occlusion. Despite impressive progress in ground-level person ReID using datasets like Market-1501 [1], CUHK03 [2], MARS [3], DukeMTMC-ReID [4], and LTCC [5], these benchmarks are largely constrained to fixed-camera, close-range, lateral-view scenarios. While they have catalyzed algorithmic advances, they fail to capture the severe viewpoint and scale variations encountered in aerial settings. On the other hand, aerial-only datasets such as PDESTRE [6], UAV-Human [7], PRID-2011 [8], MRP [9], PRAI-1581 [10], Mini-drone [11], AVI [12], and DRoneHIT [13] offer aerial captures but are limited to relatively low altitudes (<10m), lack multi-session diversity, or exclude ground-view perspectives, thus limiting their value for crossview understanding and realistic tracking tasks. Bridging the aerial-ground domain remains vastly underexplored. Notable attempts include AG-ReID.v2 [14], G2APS [15], CSM [16], and iQIYI-VID [17], which introduce hybrid viewpoints. Yet, these datasets suffer from narrow altitude ranges (typically <45m), limited clothing variation, and lack fine-grained annotations necessary for robust multi-task learning.

"We propose Omni-R1 which fine-tunes a recent multi-modal LLM, Qwen2.5-Omni, on an audio question answering dataset with the reinforcement learning method GRPO. This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU benchmark. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance."

Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts. Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location, making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection, tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/
