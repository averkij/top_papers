[ 1 0 1 9 8 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r Behind Maya: Building Multilingual Vision Language Model Nahid Alam1,2, Bala Krishna Vegesna5, Iftekhar Uddin2, Drishti Sharma2, Karthik Reddy Kanjula2, Abhipsha Das2, Shayekh Bin Islam7,2, Surya Guthikonda3,2, Anthony Susevski2, Roshan Santhosh8, Timothy Chung4,2, Ryan Sze-Yin Chan6, Snegha A9, Chen Liu10, Isha Chaturvedi2, Genta Indra Winata11, Ashvanth.S2, Snehanshu Mukherjee12, Alham Fikri AjiIn recent times, we have seen rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They have shown impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages but lack performance on low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multilingual VLM. Our contributions are: 1) multilingual imagetext pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; and 2) multilingual imagetext model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks. Code available at https://github.com/nahidalam/maya. 1. Introduction Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision encoders like CLIP [28] and SigLIP [40] has greatly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Models such as Flamingo [2], LLaVA [19, 20], KOSMOS [25, 27], Florence-2 [37], and Molmo [9] excel at image captioning, VQA, and reasoning. Qwen2-VLs M-RoPE [32, 36] and PaLIs joint modality and cross-lingual scaling [6, 7] further improve multimodal understanding. We acknowledge that although Aya Vision [8] showcases multilingual capabilities in 23 languages, it was released subsequent to the development of Maya. In general though, VLMs still underperform in lowresource languages, struggling with cultural context and localized visual concepts [15]. key reason is the lack of high-quality multilingual multimodal data. Most pretraining datasetsCOCO [18], Flickr30K [38], LAION [30], Visual Genome [16], and LLaVA [20]are English-centric, others [10, 35] remain limited in scale and cultural coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce Maya, an open-source multilingual VLM that extends multimodal capabilities to eight languages. Our key contributions: 1. novel multilingual image-text pretraining dataset consisting of 550K samples for future development of multilingual VLMs, 2. new multilingual VLM that demonstrates improved performance in understanding cultural and linguistic nuances compared to PALO-7B [22] on LLaVA-BenchIn-The-Wild [20], offering multilingual alternative to LLaVA [20]. 2. Dataset Creation and Filtering 2.1. Dataset Creation Methodology Recently, PALO [22] and Pangea [39] have created multilingual image-text dataset to build multilingual multimodal models. However, these multilingual datasets often suffer from data quality issues and distribution biases across languages. For example, in the PALO dataset, the distribution varies signiﬁcantly between English and other languages [10, 13, 22]. To address these limitations, we present novel pre-training dataset tailored for LLaVAs architecture that is both multilingual and optimized for diverse language representation. Our dataset introduces rigorous processes for toxicity analysis, distribution balance, and quality control, ensuring consistent and reliable performance in multiple languages and modalities, as shown in Figure 1. We expand the original English LLaVA dataset, which contains 550K samples, to include seven additional languagesChinese, French, Spanish, Russian, Hindi, Japanese, and Arabicyielding total of 4.4 million samples, equally distributed across all eight languages. Our approach encompasses three components: 1) parallel dataset creation using hybrid translation method, 2) prompt engineering optimization, and 3) scalable generation of pre-training datasets. This pipeline integrates multiple language models, such as [3, 24, 33], alongside specialized multilingual models like Aya 35B [4], to ensure quality, cross-lingual data suitable for multilingual applications. Figure 1. Pretrain Dataset Preparation Process 2.1.1. Multilingual LLaVA Pretrain Dataset Our Multilingual Pretrain dataset builds on the LLaVA dataset [20], using image-text pairs and the corresponding GPT responses. Our approach started with sampling to select 30 diverse samples per language, guided by Length Analysis (LA), Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), and FleschKincaid Grade Level (FKGL) metrics [34] to obtain representative GPT response in English. cascaded translation and veriﬁcation process ensures quality: initial translation using Google Translate, followed by back-translation and ﬁnal human review with the help of [1, 3, 33] to generate the prompt engineering dataset in 8 languages. 2.1.2. Prompt Engineering and Evaluation During prompt engineering, we evaluate prompts per language using BLEU score-based process. We construct prompt evaluation dataset following Figure 1, translating six sample prompts into seven languages using Aya 35B. These translations are compared with reference translations of the prompt engineering dataset using BLEU [26] and N-gram scores [5, 31]. In Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Japanese, Russian and Spanish, Preamble 6 consistently produces the highest BLEU scores per Ngram (typically 0.40.5), showing clear improvement from Type 5. Figure 2 shows Preamble 6 with the largest area in 1to 4-grams, indicating better ﬁdelity to the phrase level and consistent performance across languages. We adopt Preamble 6 as our ﬁnal prompt template, shown in Listing 1, and integrate it into our translation framework. 2.1.3. Translation Framework Design Our translation framework uses the best preamble identiﬁed in the prompt engineering evaluation step. The prompt includes 1) standardized input-output formatting to maintain uniformity across languages, 2) example-driven instruction sets tailored for complex translations, and 3) integrated validation triggers to ensure quality control. Using Aya 35B translation capabilities, our framework achieves more than 0.47 average BLEU scores in seven languages. Listing 1.

We theoretically investigate density control in 3DGS. As training via gradient descent progresses, many Gaussian primitives are observed to become stationary while failing to reconstruct the regions they cover (e.g. the cyan-colored blobs in the top-left figure marked with ). From an optimization-theoretic perspective (see figure on the right), we reveal that these primitives are trapped in saddle points, the regions in the loss landscape where gradients are insufficient to further reduce loss, leaving parameters sub-optimal locally. To address this, we introduce SteepGS, which efficiently identifies Gaussian points located in saddle area, splits them into two off-springs, and displaces new primitives along the steepest descent directions. This restores the effectiveness of successive gradient-based updates by escaping the saddle area (e.g. the orange-colored blobs in the top-left figure marked with become optimizable after densification). As shown in the bottom-left visualization, SteepGS achieves more compact parameterization while preserving the fidelity of fine geometric details. "

In recent times, we have seen a rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They have shown impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages but lack performance on low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multilingual VLM. Our contributions are: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; and 2) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

Pretraining datasets are foundational to the development of multimodal models, yet they often have inherent biases and toxic content from the web-scale corpora they are sourced from. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of toxicity in LLaVA image-text pretraining dataset, examining how harmful content manifests in different modalities. We present a comprehensive analysis of common toxicity categories and propose targeted mitigation strategies, resulting in the creation of a refined toxicity-mitigated dataset. This dataset removes 7,531 of toxic image-text pairs in the LLaVA pre-training dataset. We offer guidelines for implementing robust toxicity detection pipelines. Our findings underscore the need to actively identify and filter toxic content - such as hate speech, explicit imagery, and targeted harassment - to build more responsible and equitable multimodal systems. The toxicity-mitigated dataset is open source and is available for further research.

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time, high-resolution novel view synthesis. By representing scenes as a mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands - posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability.

Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability."
