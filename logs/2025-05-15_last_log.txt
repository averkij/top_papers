Keywords: Learning from Videos, Skill RepresentationsLearning from human videos has emerged as central paradigm in robot learning, offering scalable approach to the scarcity of robot-specific data by leveraging large, diverse video sources. Human videos contain everyday behaviors such as human-object interactions, which could provide rich source of skills for robot learning. Here, central question arises: Can robots acquire crossembodiment skill representations by watching large-scale human demonstrations? Translating human videos into robot-executable skill representations has traditionally relied on paired human-robot datasets [1, 2, 3] or predefined semantic skill labels [4, 5], both of which are difficult to scale. Recent approaches aim to bypass these requirements by learning cross-embodiment skill representations without explicit pairing or labeling [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. However, these methods still impose constraints on data collection, such as multi-view camera setups, and task and scene alignment between human and robot demonstrations, which limit their scalability and applicability to real-world, in-the-wild human videos. To this end, we propose Universal Skill representations (UniSkill), scalable approach for learning cross-embodiment skill representations from large-scale in-the-wild video data so that robot can translate an unseen human demonstration into sequence of robot-executable skill representations, as illustrated in Figure 1. To extract reusable, embodiment-agnostic motion patterns from videos, UniSkill focuses on capturing dynamics changes between temporally distant video frames, which denotes equal contributions. Figure 1: Universal Skill representations (UniSkill) are cross-embodiment skill representations shared across various embodiments (e.g., humans, Franka, WidowX) trained from both human and robot videos via skill dynamics modeling. Unlike prior works that require additional supervision (e.g., trajectory labels) or alignment between human and robot videos, UniSkill removes these constraints by learning solely from off-the-shelf video datasetssuch as Something-Something V2 [11] and H2O [12] for human videos, and DROID [13], Bridge V2 [14], and LIBERO [15] for robot videos. UniSkill, trained on large-scale cross-embodiment videos, learns an embodiment-agnostic skill representation that enables interpreting human videos as skill sequences executable directly through skill-conditioned policy. can be agnostic to embodiments and shared across diverse videos. UniSkill leverages an imageediting pipeline, which naturally emphasizes dynamic regions over static content, and encodes the resulting motion patterns into skill representations. The design choice enables the use of arbitrary, embodiment-agnostic video datasets for training, making it possible to scale cross-embodiment skill representation learning to large, in-the-wild datasets. As result of its embodiment-agnostic skill representation, UniSkill can imitate given prompt video by capturing sequence of motion patterns within it, even when demonstration is performed by human. Our experiments demonstrate that UniSkill effectively learn cross-embodiment skill representations by training on large-scale video datasets. Its embodiment-agnostic design allows it to generalize to unseen human prompts at test time, without any kind of additional guidance such as language instructions. Notably, UniSkills skill-centric architecture enhances robustness to novel objects and supports compositional task solving. In addition, its versatile training pipeline benefits from incorporating diverse video datasets, with performance improving as more data sources are added. Finally, qualitative results from the Forward Skill Dynamics (FSD) model predictions and skill representation visualizations highlight the interpretability of the learned representations. In summary, our contributions are twofold: We introduce UniSkill, universal skill representation learning approach that enables the use of large-scale video data by removing the need for labels or any form of alignment constraints. UniSkill shows effective human-to-robot and robot-to-robot imitation in both simulation and real-world experiments through its embodiment-agnostic skill representation.Learning action (or skill) representations for robot learning from in-the-wild video dataset is challenging due to the absence of action labels. Recent work on latent action models addresses this by deriving action-relevant information through inverse or forward dynamics models. LAPO [16] and Genie [17] propose to learn generative interactive environments from gameplay videos with latent actions, but they are primarily tailored to game settings with discrete actions. LAPA [18] extends this line of research to real-world robotic manipulation by incorporating diverse videos, including 2 Figure 2: The overview of UniSkill. (a) Inverse Skill Dynamics (ISD) and Forward Skill Dynamics (FSD) are jointly trained on diverse video datasets to encode dynamics information into universal skill representations by predicting skills and future frames, respectively.

Despite impressive progress in ground-level person ReID using datasets like Market-1501 [1], CUHK03 [2], MARS [3], DukeMTMC-ReID [4], and LTCC [5], these benchmarks are largely constrained to fixed-camera, close-range, lateral-view scenarios. While they have catalyzed algorithmic advances, they fail to capture the severe viewpoint and scale variations encountered in aerial settings. On the other hand, aerial-only datasets such as PDESTRE [6], UAV-Human [7], PRID-2011 [8], MRP [9], PRAI-1581 [10], Mini-drone [11], AVI [12], and DRoneHIT [13] offer aerial captures but are limited to relatively low altitudes (<10m), lack multi-session diversity, or exclude ground-view perspectives, thus limiting their value for crossview understanding and realistic tracking tasks. Bridging the aerial-ground domain remains vastly underexplored. Notable attempts include AG-ReID.v2 [14], G2APS [15], CSM [16], and iQIYI-VID [17], which introduce hybrid viewpoints. Yet, these datasets suffer from narrow altitude ranges (typically <45m), limited clothing variation, and lack fine-grained annotations necessary for robust multi-task learning.

Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

Recovering high-quality 3D scenes from a single RGB image is a challenging task in computer graphics. Current methods often struggle with domain-specific limitations or low-quality object generation. To address these, we propose CAST (Component-Aligned 3D Scene Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image), a novel method for 3D scene reconstruction and recovery. CAST starts by extracting object-level 2D segmentation and relative depth information from the input image, followed by using a GPT-based model to analyze inter-object spatial relationships. This enables the understanding of how objects relate to each other within the scene, ensuring more coherent reconstruction. CAST then employs an occlusion-aware large-scale 3D generation model to independently generate each object's full geometry, using MAE and point cloud conditioning to mitigate the effects of occlusions and partial object information, ensuring accurate alignment with the source image's geometry and texture. To align each object with the scene, the alignment generation model computes the necessary transformations, allowing the generated meshes to be accurately placed and integrated into the scene's point cloud. Finally, CAST incorporates a physics-aware correction step that leverages a fine-grained relation graph to generate a constraint graph. This graph guides the optimization of object poses, ensuring physical consistency and spatial coherence. By utilizing Signed Distance Fields (SDF), the model effectively addresses issues such as occlusions, object penetration, and floating objects, ensuring that the generated scene accurately reflects real-world physical interactions. CAST can be leveraged in robotics, enabling efficient real-to-simulation workflows and providing realistic, scalable simulation environments for robotic systems.

Recent work improves interpretability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by decomposing tasks into sub-task programs, but these methods are computationally expensive and less accurate due to poor adaptation to target data. To address this, we introduce VISTAR (Visually Interpretable Subtask-Aware Reasoning Model), a subtask-driven training framework that enhances both interpretability and reasoning by generating textual and visual explanations within MLLMs. Instead of relying on external models, VISTAR fine-tunes MLLMs to produce structured Subtask-of-Thought rationales (step-by-step reasoning sequences). Experiments on two benchmarks show that VISTAR consistently improves reasoning accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Our code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/ChengJade/VISTAR.
