Probabilistic confidence represents the probability of the model generating the next token corresponding to the target coordinates, while verbalized confidence indicates the model’s self-reported certainty about its output in natural language. (b): Comparisons of accuracy, probabilistic confidence, and verbalized confidence for several general-purpose and GUI-specific models on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. The models exhibit a higher confidence in their answers than in the accuracy that they actually achieve.",
