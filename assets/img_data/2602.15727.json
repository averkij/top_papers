This mixed LoRA is injected into a conditional flow model (e.g.Flux.1-Kontext[5]).\nNext, we build a2×22\\times 2composite image from{𝐚,𝐚′,𝐛}\\{{\\mathbf{a}},{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\prime},{\\mathbf{b}}\\}. The conditional flow model gets this composite image as its input, along with a guiding edit prompt, and produces a composite image with the edited results𝐛′{\\mathbf{b}}^{\\prime}in the bottom-right quadrant.",
