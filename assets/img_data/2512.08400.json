(a)-(d) show common problems: (a) obstruction of the camera view by the crew’s hands; (b) lens fogging and high occlusion; (c) heavy pixelation from degraded video compression; (d) organic debris masks portions of the catch. In contrast, (e) represents a clear view of a catch with overlapping individuals, and (f) shows the ideal scenario in which the individuals are dispersed in an even layer across the conveyor belt without overlapping (Data Source:[martin2024]).",

(a) An individual is detected and assigned a unique identity (ID-25). (b-c) The system performs re-identification, successfully matching the fish after it’s handled, disappears, and reappears with a new orientation within the same camera view on the conveyor belt. (d) The model’s capacity for long-term, inter-camera Re-ID is shown, correctly matching ID-25 hours later in a different location under a new camera. This could be a subsampling station in the fishing vessel.",

A new, learnable linear layer is then appended to each backbone to project these high-dimensional features into a final, shared 512-dimensional embedding space. D represents Dimensions.",
