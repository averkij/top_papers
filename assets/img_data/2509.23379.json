Medical hallucinations are highlighted inred, referring to generated clinical content that is not supported by the image. Clinically irrelevant or counterfactual information in the reference clinical section is shown inblue. With our Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), medical hallucinations in the baseline models are mitigated across both tasks and question types.",

During inference, it operates in two stages:(a)Symptom-grounded Contrastive Decoding, which incorporates structured clinical labels from the expert model; and(b)Expert-informed Contrastive Decoding, which adjusts the latent token logits using expert-derived confidence scores. The output logits are hierarchically calibrated to better match the ground-truth clinical labels. Hallucinated symptoms in the model output are marked inred.",
