The models’ structured outputs are then\npost-processed to extract tabular data. The lower panel illustrates the\nmulti-facet analysis framework, comparing manual extraction of 13\nreference features with model-derived features through performance\nmetrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score),\nassessment of translation effects, crobustness analysis (Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), missing values), and sensitivity–specificity trade-offs.",
