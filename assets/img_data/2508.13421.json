The master agent (purple) coordinates the core scientific workflow agents (green) including method, data analysis, and visuals. Expansion to subagent modules (shades of brown) provides domain-specific capabilities, and interactions with specialist agent pathways (blue) handle specialised tasks including coding, review, troubleshooting, and inspection processes. The stacked panel agent boxes indicate agents completing tasks in parallel, while the dotted connections to blank boxes represent further agent lineages in the system not shown here for clarity. Arrows indicate bidirectional data flow between modules and across hierarchical levels. The distributed architecture enables offloading of complex research tasks while maintaining coherent experimental narratives through the centralised master coordinator.",

Each level encompasses the functionalities of those beneath it while introducing emergent properties. Retrieval forms the foundational layer, providing access to external information and internal memory stores. Abstraction enables pattern recognition and generalisation beyond specific instances. Metacognition introduces self-monitoring and strategic control of cognitive processes. Decomposition allows complex problems to be systematically partitioned into manageable components. Autonomy confers goal-directed behaviour independent of external guidance. Collaboration represents the highest level, enabling coordinated multi-agent interaction and collective problem-solving.",

Each circle represents a complete experimental iteration, with transitions between cycles driven by hypothesis refinement and knowledge accumulation. The Internal/External Seed initiates the research trajectory, establishing initial hypotheses or responding to external queries. Progressive cycles demonstrate the capacity for autonomous experimental design, execution, and interpretation, with each iteration informed by previous outcomes. The expanding experimental space explored through successive iterations is characteristic of open-ended scientific discovery.",

Phase 1 (Generation) produces unique, ranked idea suggestions by brainstorming initial concepts, removing redundancies, filtering impractical proposals, ranking by scientific merit, and re-ranking to refine prioritisation. Phase 2 (Formulation) develops the suggestions into detailed research ideas through expansion of conceptual scope, formulation of testable hypotheses, review to interrogate validity, and iterative improvement. Phase 3 (Validation) yields final vetted research ideas via literature review for context, novelty checking against existing work, feasibility assessment for methodological adaptability, and finalisation of a structured research proposal",
