Our approach consists of three core components:\n(1) FSM Initialization, which formalizes the research process as a dynamic finite state machine initialized from prior experiences;\n(2) Structured Self-Evolution, which employs atomic operations to precisely optimize both the system’s skill operators (𝒪s​k​i​l​l\\mathcal{O}_{skill}) and flow operators (𝒪f​l​o​w\\mathcal{O}_{flow}) based on critic feedback; and\n(3) Self-Evolving Memory Mechanism, which distills successful and failure trajectories into an experience pool to facilitate continuous learning and warm-starting for future tasks.",
