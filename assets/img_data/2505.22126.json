As can be seen from the framework, human experts set the standards for batch downloading and filtering paper data from the Internet. MLLM and human experts work together to screen triplet data to ensure the authority and scientific nature of the data. At the same time, we use the MLLM which is consistent with the human preference and evaluation for automatic scoring.",
