The “With Critical Token” line shows that, without intervention, repeated sampling from the original trajectory consistently fails to produce correct trajectories. In contrast, the “Without Critical Token” line demonstrates that replacing the identified critical token with an alternative drastically increases the likelihood of correct reasoning outcomes. This underscores the significant role of critical tokens in incorrect reasoning trajectories.",
