(A) Multiple base models generate peptide sequence candidates from the spectrum input, which are subsequently reranked by RankNovo. (B) The architecture of RankNovo incorporates a multi-peptide encoder, utilizing axial attention along both row and column dimensions and cross-attention to effectively integrate spectrum features. (C) The coarse-grained PMD metric assesses peptide-level differences through dynamic programming-based sequence alignment. (D) The fine-grained RMD metric provides a more granular assessment by capturing residue-level mass deviations between the query and target peptides.",
