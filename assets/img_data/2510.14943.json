During training, our approach augments the standard RLVR process with an additional MSE loss between the verifier-based rewards (rvr_{v}) and the last-token self-rewarding scores (rsr_{s}), wherersr_{s}is the difference between the policy model‚Äôs next-token log-probabilities of a pre-specified special token at the final response token and a pre-calculated constantcr‚Äãe‚Äãfc_{ref}, scaled by the KL coefficientŒ≤v\\beta_{v}. The optimized self-rewarding scores can serve as auxiliary reward signals in both training and testing stages to enhance model performance.",
