                "caption": "Figure 2:Illustration of the navigation process ofMG-Nav, a dual-scale framework combining global planning with local execution.(a) Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG)serves as a compact, region-centric memory; each node aggregates multi-view keyframes and object semantics, while edges encode navigable connectivity.(b) Global Planning with SMG: Both the agent and the goal are localized on the SMG via an image-to-instance hybrid node retrieval. A goal-conditioned path from the current observation at time t to the goal is then planned along the graph edges to provide global guidance.(c) Local Navigation via Geometry-Enhanced Policy: a navigation foundation policy, geometrically enhanced with theVGGT-adapter, moves the agent between adjacent nodes while maintaining obstacle avoidance and accurate visual goal alignment. By running global planning (f1) and local navigation (f2) at different frequencies with periodic re-localization, MG-Nav achieves robust zero-shot navigation in dynamic, unseen environments.",
