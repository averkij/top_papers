VAREdit first encodes and quantizes the images into multi-scale residuals and maps the instructions into textual token embeddings. These features are organized as the finest-scale source featureùêÖK(s‚Äãr‚Äãc)\\mathbf{F}_{K}^{(src)}, the pooled textual representationùêÖ~0(t‚Äãg‚Äãt)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{F}}_{0}^{(tgt)}, the coarse-to-fine target featuresùêÖ~1:K‚àí1(t‚Äãg‚Äãt)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{F}}_{1:K-1}^{(tgt)}, and then sent to the VAR Transformer. The source featureùêÖK(s‚Äãr‚Äãc)\\mathbf{F}_{K}^{(src)}is further sent to the SAR module in the first self-attention layer to address the scale mismatch issue, while the textual token embeddings are also used for cross-attention calculations of key and value matrices. The ground truth residualsùêë1:K\\mathbf{R}_{1:K}guide the training of the lastKKoutput residualsùêë^1:K\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}_{1:K}. During inference, the residualsùêë^1:K\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}_{1:K}are predicted autoregressively, which are then cumulated and decoded to the edited image.",
