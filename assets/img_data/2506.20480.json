                "caption": "Figure 1:Our Approach:Model Pruning through Cutting and Stitching. We achieve competitive model pruning performance by running a zero-order search that tailors layers based on a shared pool of finetuned variants of the original model, selecting and stitching layers if necessary. The model finetunes accentuate task-specific skills, allowing us to merge key components into a smaller model, maintaining, for example, 97% of capabilities of Llama-13B, even after a 25% reduction in layers.",
