The left side shows example attribution scores for truthful and untruthful responses, and the right side shows the resulting attribution differences. Colors correspond to the four scenarios discussed above. In case [1], competing attributions result in a positive difference, indicating a positive correlation with truthfulness, while case [4] illustrates the opposite situation. Case [2] indicates a clear bias toward untruthfulness, whereas case [3] shows a strong bias toward truthfulness.",
