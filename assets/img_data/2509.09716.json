Given a instruction and a generated voice answer, the LALM evaluator conducts a hierarchical assessment: (1)Content evaluation, where failure leads to a score of 1; (2)Style evaluation, assigning a score of 2 for non-compliance, 3 for partial compliance, and progressing if satisfied; and (3)Naturalness evaluation, yielding a score of 4 for unnatural and 5 for highly natural speech. This staged process underlies the 5-point MOS scoring scheme.",
