While the prompt solely targets color modification, baseline models exhibit significant limitations: they often suffer from reduced resolution, introduce unwanted structural changes (modifying shape or position), or fail to apply the target color change. By leveraging our agent’s superior interpretation capabilities, our method accurately captures the instruction’s focus while preserving the integrity of the original image.",
