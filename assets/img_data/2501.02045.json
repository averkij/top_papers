Wastewater samples are collected and undergo deep metagenomic sequencing to generate DNA and RNA sequences totaling over 1.5 trillion base pairs. These sequences are tokenized using byte-pair encoding (BPE) to create the pretraining dataset. The data is used to train METAGENE-1, a 7B-parameter transformer model that enables a wide range of metagenomic analysis and monitoring applications.",
