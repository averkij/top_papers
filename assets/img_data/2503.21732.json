A sparse transformer encoder-decoder compresses the structured feature into a more compact latent space, followed by a self-pruning upsampling for higher resolution. Finally, the structured features are decoded to SparseFlex through a linear layer. Using the frustum-aware section voxel training strategy, we can train the entire pipeline more efficiently by rendering loss.",

In contrast, our approach (right) adaptively activates the relevant voxels and enables the reconstruction of mesh interiors only using rendering supervision.",
