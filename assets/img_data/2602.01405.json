In the pre-task survey, participants answered questions regarding their prior experience with conversational AI and their prior attitude and demographic questions. Participants then chose a task from three available topics. They were then randomly assigned a system with which they complete the task. Following which, they were asked three post-task questions about their results, conversation and productivity. They then choose a second task from the remaining two options and were assigned the systemnotassigned in task 1 and completed the task with the post task questions. After which, participants were asked three general questions about their experience with FeedbackGPT and then were asked eight questions about their experience with FeedbackGPT aimed to capture the effects of feedback barriers in FeedbackGPT.",
