The warped image is encoded to get𝐳s→t\\mathbf{z}_{s\\to t}, and the ground-truth image is encoded to get𝐳t\\mathbf{z}_{t}. A \"clean composite\" latent𝐳c,t\\mathbf{z}_{c,t}is created by combining the valid warped regions from𝐳s→t\\mathbf{z}_{s\\to t}with the blank regions from𝐳t\\mathbf{z}_{t}, using the downsampled mask𝐌latent\\mathbf{M}_{\\text{latent}}.2) Training ST-Diffusion:This composite latent sequence is noised according to our spatio-temporal schedule, resulting in a noisy latent sequence (visualized as a stack) where the noise level for each latent varies across different frames and spatial regions. The resulting noisy latents are fed into our model𝑮θ\\bm{G}_{\\theta}, which is trained to predict the target velocity (defined asϵt−𝐳t\\mathbf{\\epsilon}_{t}-\\mathbf{z}_{t}), forcing it to learn the flow from the noisy composite latent back towards the original ground-truth latent sequence𝒵\\mathcal{Z}.",
