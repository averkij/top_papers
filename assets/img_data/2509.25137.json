For real-world requests,\nRLHI operates in two modes: (1) User-Guided Rewrites, where unsatisfactory model outputs are revised based on users’ natural-language follow-ups, creating preference pairs between the original and rewritten responses; and (2) User-Based Rewards, where multiple candidate responses are generated and ranked by a reward model conditioned on the user’s persona, yielding chosen-rejected pairs. Both methods leverage personas and multi-turn context to enable personalized alignment.",
