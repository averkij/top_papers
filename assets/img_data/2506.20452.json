While standard Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) can produce globally coherent images, it lacks fine details when upscaled to 4096√ó\\times√ó4096 resolution (left column). Existing training-free methods (e.g., Pixelsmith(Tragakis et¬†al.,2024)) enhance details in SDXL outputs but often introduce duplicated objects and visual artifacts (middle column). In contrast,HiWaveleverages a patch-wise DDIM inversion strategy combined with a wavelet-based detail enhancer module to produce high-quality images with rich details and minimal duplication artifacts. The second and third rows show 10√ó\\times√óand 5√ó\\times√ómagnified views of the red and green boxed regions, respectively.",

                "caption": "Figure 3.Overview of HiWave, our training-free high-resolution image generation pipeline. We first generate a base image using a pretrained model through a standard sampling process that transforms random noise (zTsubscriptùëßùëáz_{T}italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) into a clean image (z~0subscript~ùëß0\\tilde{z}_{0}over~ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) conditioned on a text prompt. This image is then upscaled in the image domain using Lanczos interpolation and encoded back into the latent space via the VAE encoder to enrich the base image with additional details. A patch-wise DDIM inversion process is then performed, mapping the upscaled image back to its corresponding noise representation. Finally, our DWT-based detail enhancement approach applies frequency-selective guidance during denoising, using wavelet decomposition to independently control low-frequency structure and guide high-frequency components for finer details. Skip residuals are also incorporated during the early sampling steps to further preserve the global coherence of the base image. This pipeline enables HiWave to generate high-quality, high-resolution images without duplications.",
