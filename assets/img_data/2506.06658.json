Composing these two components results in a visual planner with strong priors, which when utilized to interact with the environment, is able to produce trajectories with improved success rate even for initially unseen tasks. In the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), these trajectories are then iteratively fed back to finetune the in-domain model (right), thus improving the overall quality of the adapted visual planner as a whole through self-collected online experience.",
