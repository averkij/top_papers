It has two separate branches: the video branch processes video and image tokens, and the trajectory branch uses Trajectory ControlNet to fuse trajectory and image tokens, which is later integrated to the video branch through a zero-initialized convolution layer.\nBesides, diffusion features from DiT blocks are concatenated and processed by a trainable segment head to predict latent segmentation masks, which contribute to our latent segment loss.",
