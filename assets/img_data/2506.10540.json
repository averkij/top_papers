Photography Agent generates candidate video clips using MCTS-Gen, which optimizes exploration-exploitation balance. Reviewer Agent evaluates clips with our AniEval assessment system. Post-production Agent assembles selected clips, adds voiceovers, and synchronizes audio with subtitles. This multi-agent system enables fully automated, high-quality animated storytelling.",

In the story, Tom brings a sack of toys to the town square, where he meets a sad girl named Lily who has no toys. Tom offers to share his toys, and the two children happily play together. Three models‚ÄîStoryDiffusion, StoryAdapter, and AniMaker (ours)‚Äîare compared. AniMaker demonstrates superior narrative consistency, emotional expression, and character continuity across frames. It coherently depicts the extended action sequence of Tom picking up the sack, leaving his house, and arriving at the square. In contrast, while StoryDiffusion and StoryAdapter capture key moments from the story, they suffer from inconsistencies in visual coherence and character alignment, with mismatched character appearances highlighted by red boxes in the figure.",

This figure visualizes the story of Sue, a little girl who tries to climb a big tree in the park but gets scared. Her friend Tom warns her to be careful, and she climbs down safely. Grateful, Sue hugs Tom, and they play on the swings together. The comparison includes MovieAgent, MMStoryAgent, VideoGen-of-Thought, and AniMaker (ours). AniMaker stands out with coherent scene progression, expressive character interactions, and consistent character identities. It clearly captures Sue‚Äôs emotional journey and key events‚Äîfrom climbing the tree and feeling afraid, to receiving help and having fun‚Äîdemonstrating strong temporal and narrative alignment. In contrast, MovieAgent shows limited relevance to the input story, with inconsistent visuals and abstract content. VideoGen-of-Thought and MMStoryAgent follow the narrative more closely but still suffer from visual continuity issues, with character mismatches highlighted in red boxes.",
