Every fixed number of rounds of conversation, three components of the Safeguard Agent, the Emotion Watcher, Thought Refiner, and Dialog Guide, collaboratively analyze the chat with the latest profile. The Manager of the Safeguard Agent then synthesizes their outputs and provides advice to the character-based agent. After the conversation, the user agent undergoes a mental health assessment. If the mental health condition deteriorates over a threshold, the chat history is analyzed to identify potential causes by the Update System. With all historical profiles and potential causes, the Update System further improves the profile of the safeguard agent, completing the iterative training process.",
