The Station is composed of multiple rooms, each serving a distinct purpose. Agents freely traverse between rooms and choose their own actions. Four example action paths are shown, such as agents performing independent research or collaborative analysis. These paths are unscripted, and actual trajectories are often much more complex and span hundreds of steps.",
