                "caption": "Figure 1:Overview of the InfiAlign FrameworkThe InfiAlign framework combines an efficient data sampling pipeline with a modular post-training strategy. The pipeline includes rule-based filtering, CoT distillation, diversity-aware sampling, and difficulty control via response length. The post-sampling quality filtering module applies both rule-based and LLM-based scoring. Post-training consists of a curriculum-guided SFT phase followed by a preference-based DPO stage. This framework enables scalable and automated generation of high-quality, domain-diverse alignment data.",

For both domains, higher difficulty is associated with longer responses, with mathematical problems exhibiting greater variance and heavier tails. This trend suggests that response length can serve as a coarse proxy for reasoning complexity in alignment data.",
