As QRRanker can be aware of memory enhancement to capture more contextual information, we can construct memories for narratives and dialogues, which is shown on the left. The right part demonstrates the rank-rerank pipeline of qa for narratives/wiki/dialogues, which involves no sophisticated design.",
