Points of divergence highlight differences in strategy, task decomposition, and assumption handling, revealing key limitations in LLM reasoning and opportunities for complementary human-AI collaboration.",

The final operating agreements and memos are then reviewed and verified by other law students, emulating the oversight of senior partners in a law firm.",

The intra-subtask level (middle row) decomposes each stage into finer-grained tasks and shows their interconnections. The node-level (bottom row) represents individual actions, annotated by cognitive modality: introspective (internal legal reasoning), interactive (client or colleague communication), and observable (use of external tools and resources). Thus, the task diagram captures the complexity, adaptivity, and tool-mediated nature of real-world legal reasoning.",
