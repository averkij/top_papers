These points, assigned velocities, are linked to an elastic 3D volume with material parameters governing deformation. The differentiable physics-based skinning module generates natural deformations, optimizing velocities and material properties via backward propagation. Finally, multi-view animations illustrate physically plausible shape deformations over time.",
