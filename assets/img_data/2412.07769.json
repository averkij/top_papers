Medical images are processed through a Vision Encoder and aligned with a Projector, while the text inputs are tokenized using the default tokenizer. The resulting tokens are then passed into the language model (Meta Llama 3.1) to generate responses in the prompted language. We only train the language model using LoRA adapters, while the projector is finetuned for medical image-text alignment. A robust data generation framework translates an English data corpus into Arabic using GPT-4o, with verification by a medical expert to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate translations. This approach supports effective training and benchmarking in a bilingual context.",
