The tree consists ofClosednodes (blue, visited states with attached program likex12x_{12}) and a Frontier ofOpennodes (orange, pending hypotheses likeu13u_{13}). The workflow iterates through three phases: (1)Action Selection, where the most promising action node is retrieved from the frontier based on world model estimated priority scoreVV; (2)Local Refinement, where a stochastic policyπcode\\pi_{\\text{code}}samples concrete implementations until stagnation; and (3)World Model Update, where the LLM reasons over the trajectory to update the search tree viaInsert(adding new actions),Update(adjustingVV, e.g.,u11u_{11}dropping from 0.9 to 0.6), andPrune(removing less promising nodes likeu10u_{10}).",
