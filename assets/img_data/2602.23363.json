An input of a medical image and a natural language question is processed by MediX-R1. The model’s policy is trained using Group Based RL, which leverages a multi-faceted reward signal. This reward is composed of: a) an LLM-based reward for evaluating the overall quality and correctness of the output; b) an embedding-based reward to ensure semantic alignment; c) a format reward to enforce the desired output structure (<think>and<answer>blocks); and d) a modality reward to ensure the response is grounded in the specified imaging modality. This reward-guided approach encourages the model to generate accurate and interpretable reasoning paths.",
