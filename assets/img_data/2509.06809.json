The average score (y-axis) is plotted against four levels of task difficulty. Two key trends are apparent: (1) performance degrades for all models as difficulty increases, and (2) the structural reasoning required for the Reconstruction task proves significantly more challenging than other tasks, with smaller models failing almost completely.",
