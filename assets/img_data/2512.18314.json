Then we project 2D materials to 3D via ray tracing, and refine per Gaussian materials with our Neural Merger that has a softmax output layer, choosing between the projected values. We then supervise the produced material maps using the predicted 2D material maps. Additionally, using deferred shading we supervise by a PBR-based photometric rendering loss with the multi-view ground truth images of the object.",
