When the model‚Äôs prior belief conflicts with the external passage (left), SR-DCR evaluates two key signals: (a) the self-confidence of the zero-context answera^priorsubscript^ùëéprior\\hat{a}_{\\textsc{prior}}over^ start_ARG italic_a end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT prior end_POSTSUBSCRIPT; and (b) the context‚Äôs reasonableness, determined via an asymmetric debate between two LLM agents. A judge model monitors the debate overNùëÅNitalic_Nrounds and issues a verdict on the trustworthiness of the context. The final answer is selected by jointly considering both the model‚Äôs self-confidence and the judged context reliability (right).",
