Existing methods typically perform reasoning based solely on pure text or 2D visual cues, without fully exploiting the rich spatial and geometric information inherent in images. Other methods attempt to enhance the input by introducing auxiliary modalities (e.g., depth maps or coordinates), yet these often depend on additional annotations or external tools. In contrast, our framework enables VLMs to intrinsically form 3D mental representations during reasoning, thereby improving their spatial understanding.",

(1) Stage 1:3DThinkeris first trained under supervision using our constructed CoT data (see Sec.3.1), aligning the generated 3D latents with the feature space of 3D foundation model. This alignment allows the model to leverage suitable 3D spatial mentaling while reasoning. (2) Stage 2: After supervised training, we further optimize the entire trajectory using only outcome signals, while maintaining the alignment of the 3D latents.",
