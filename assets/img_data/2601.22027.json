(2)Hallucination: a required (a) tool, (b) tool parameter, or (c) tool result is removed, making task completion impossible; success requires the agent to acknowledge its inability due to this missing capability or information. (3)Disambiguation: the task is modified to include ambiguity that the agent must resolve, either (a) externally through user interaction or (b) by leveraging internal information.",
