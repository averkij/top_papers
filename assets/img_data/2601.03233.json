Raw video and audio signals are encoded into modality-specific latent tokens via causal VAEs, while text is processed through a refined embedding pipeline. A dual-stream diffusion transformer jointly denoises audio and video latents with bidirectional audiovisual cross-attention and text conditioning, producing synchronized audiovisual outputs.",

Red vertical lines on the audio waveform mark the timestamps of the displayed frames. The visualization demonstrates the model’s ability to spatially track a moving vehicle, dynamically shift attention from one speaker to another and then to both simultaneously, and focus on the lip region during close-up speech.",

This supports independent control of textual conditioning and inter-modal alignment during inference.",
