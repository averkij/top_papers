                "caption": "Figure 1:Hypothesis: Exportation of Information from the Core Language System to Other Brain Regions Is Necessary for Deep Understanding.A)The language system exports information to extra-linguistic systems that support deep understanding of linguistic content. Candidate exportation destinations include regions specialized for thinking about the contents of someone else’s or one’s own mind [16], regions specialized for scene understanding and navigation [19], regions that construct mental models of the physical world [21], regions that represent and process amodal semantic information [23], perceptual and motor regions (e.g., [11-13]), and regions that integrate information into a coherent representation of the situation that is being described [95-96]. These exportation destination regions are visualized with broad masks delineating where the relevant functional regions are found; although these masks may overlap, the functional regions within individuals are distinct.B)The language system supports shallow language understanding. Shallow language understanding entails recognizing individual words and how they go together within the structure of the sentence (i.e., parsing the surface form of the sentence), and then constructing a compositional representation of the sentence’s meaning, perhaps represented in a high-dimensional vector space. Importantly, these shallow representations are only defined with respect to other linguistic elements and patterns of their use that we have encountered during our lifetime of experience with language, making no contact with other aspects of our lived experience.C)Extra-linguistic systems support deep language understanding. They can be engaged both by linguistic and nonlinguistic inputs, which is why we do not consider them part of the language system. During language understanding these regions may augment the shallow representations constructed by the core language system with perceptual or motor features, translate them into a format compatible with probabilistic programing engines or symbolic problem solvers, or transform them in some other way.",
