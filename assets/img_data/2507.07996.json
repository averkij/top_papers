Starting from the original forward path, each input can dynamically skip or recurrently reuse any layer(s) to construct a custom Chain-of-Layers (CoLa). This joint space enables both layer pruning and recurrence, supporting fast-slow depth adaptation and dynamic architecture generalization from a pretrained model without any finetuning.",
