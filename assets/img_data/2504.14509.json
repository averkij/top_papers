The construction process utilizes two images with the sameID‚Å¢(A1,A2)IDsubscriptùê¥1subscriptùê¥2\\mathrm{ID}(A_{1},A_{2})roman_ID ( italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )and one image with a differentIDBsubscriptIDùêµ\\mathrm{ID}_{B}roman_ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, along with a FaceSwap Proxy model, to generate a Pseudo TargetIDB~subscriptID~ùêµ\\mathrm{ID}_{\\tilde{B}}roman_ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT over~ start_ARG italic_B end_ARG end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Additionally, we initialize our DreamID with SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single step. This allows for convenient computation of image-space losses, such as ID Loss and reconstruction Loss. (b) DreamID Model architecture. Our model architecture is composed of three components:1) The base Unet, which we refer to as SwapNet, is responsible for the main process of face swapping. 2) the face Unet feature encoder, named FaceNet, which extracts pixel-level ID information of the user image. 3) the ID Adapter that extracts the semantic-level ID information of the user image. The core feature fusion computation process is illustrated at the bottom.",
