ControlLoRA conditions on the previous frame encoded in VAE latent space for temporal coherence. The generated output at timettis used to compute the irradiance input for the next frame at timet+1t+1, enabling autoregressive frame generation. The encoderℰ\\mathcal{E}and decoder𝒟\\mathcal{D}represent the VAE components operating in latent space. The training strategy on the right shows our three-stage approach: first, we train ControlNet on the G-buffer to image translation task without irradiance. Second, we add ControlLoRA and irradiance for temporal conditioning. Third, we train autoregressively using the model’s own generated frames as previous-frame inputs to make the model robust against its own generation errors.",

We compare our model output against pure VAE reconstruction to measure encoder degradation. Metrics show degradation between frames 800–1700 when the camera enters very dark rooms; the model’s bias towards lit areas causes it to insufficiently capture extreme darkness. After frame 3000, all metrics degrade when camera movement reduces and G-buffer changes become minimal, causing error accumulation.",
