The model takes proteins, DNAs, RNAs, small molecules, and ions as inputs and designs binding partners of specified modalities through a diffusion-based generative process. (b) ODesign supports both rigid and flexible conformations when designing binding partners. (c) Unified masking strategy. Four levels of masking are applied during training, where conditioned regions are shown in yellow and designable regions in blue. (d) Task composition. ODesign supports combinations of molecular modalities—protein, ligand, RNA, DNA, ion binding protein, ligand, RNA, DNA, ion—and multiple task types including free generation, binder design, motif scaffolding, and tip-atom scaffolding. (e) Architecture of ODesign. Arrows indicate the direction of information flow across model components.",

All panels: designs are shown in purple, targets in pink, and ligands in green (carbon in green, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, sulfur in orange). (a) Protein-binding protein design. ODesign was compared with BindCraft, RFDiffusion, and BoltzDesign across ten targets, measured by the number of filter-passing designs generated per GPU per day. (b) Ligand-binding protein design. ODesign was compared with RFDiffusion-AA and BoltzDesign across four targets using the same throughput metric. (c) Motif scaffolding. ODesign was evaluated against RFDiffusion, RFDiffusion-AA, and ProteinA on the MotifBench benchmark. “Success rate” denotes the average across targets; “success number” indicates the count of targets with successful solutions; “MotifScore” is a weighted benchmark score reflecting both difficulty and success number. (d) Interface design. ODesign was compared with PocketGen; distributions of pocket-aligned RMSD and \"min_iPAE\" are shown. (e) Tip-atom (atomic motif) scaffolding. ODesign was compared with RFDiffusion-AA and RFDiffusion2 on the AME benchmark, evaluated by the number of filter-passing designs per GPU per day.",

Same metrics as in (a) are shown for DNA design. (c) Protein-binding RNA design. Distributions of protein-aligned RNA RMSD between designed and refolded complexes are shown in three RMSD intervals.
