Two models are evaluated\nincluding LongVA(Zhang et al.,2024a)and\nVideo-XL(Shu et al.,2024). As the number of sampled shots increased, performance did not consistently improve across various video lengths. That is because while sparse sampling may miss crucial details, exhaustive sampling often overwhelms the model with excessive irrelevant content. This illustrates the key challenge of optimal shot selection especially in long video understanding. That is, how to sample variable details in order to maximise semantic task information extraction whilst minimising distractions from irrelevant details (noise) in video understanding.",
