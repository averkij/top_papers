STaCS offers flexible control over initial answer exploration,\ncorrection filtering, and iterative fine-tuning. It is inspired by STaR and effectively encompasses SC as a special case. SC and STaSC allow several initial answers and corrections. The dotted line in the STaSC denotes two possible setups: fine-tuning the model and generating from it at the next iteration (Evolving Fine-Tuning) and keeping the Generator frozen and fine-tuning the Corrector model only (Fixed Fine-Tuning).",
