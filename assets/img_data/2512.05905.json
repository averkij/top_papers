To accommodate to the training setting where reference image and video input are sampled from different parts of the video, we modify the I2V model’s input structure by concatenating the reference image at the beginning of the sequence and initiating generation fromT=1T=1, using the original I2V pattern to inject the reference CLIP feature. To help the model better distinguish the conditional tokens and the noisy video sequence, we leverage the original mask mechanisim of Wan-I2V model architecture, applying an all-one mask for the reference image and the driving sequence, and an all-zero mask for the noisy video sequence.",
