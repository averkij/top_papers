Different from static inference where the policy of model remains fixed (θ0\\theta_{0}, Turn 0), this paradigm treats conversational feedback as an active signal that guides real-time parameter updates (e.g., fromθ0\\theta_{0}toθ1\\theta_{1}). This iterative process of in-conversation self-correction allows the policy to progressively evolve and align with the preference of user (θn\\theta_{n}) throughout the interaction.",

These charts comparebaseline models,RLdescribed in AppendixE.4.1, andROSAon different datasets. In contrast to the slow improvement shown in Figure2, ROSA not only achieves a higher absolute accuracy but also accelerates the learning process, as evidenced by the steeper slopes of the solid lines. This highlights efficiency of ROSA in online error correction.",
