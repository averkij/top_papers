Case 1 (Helpful): Visual imagination reveals previously unseen viewpoints, enabling helpful spatial reasoning.\nCase 2 (Misleading): Imagination fails to preserve task-relevant objects (e.g., the white table in the red box), resulting in incorrect spatial inference and wrong answers.\nCase 3 (Unnecessary): The required information is already clearly observable in the original view (e.g., the bathtub in the blue box), making additional imagined views redundant.",
