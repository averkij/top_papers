Previous two-stage synthesis methods introduce inevitable labor cost in the first stage (e.g, foreground preparation process), which hinders the efficiency of the whole synthesis pipeline. In contrast, Xsyn is a simple and effective one-stage synthesis pipeline, which can automatically refine the synthetic annotation and enhance the synthetic complexity, thereby generating high-quality synthetic data and eliminating extra labor costs.",
