Given these inputs, SAGE operates in two stages based on the role of SAGE-MM. InStage-1, SAGE-MM is responsible for providing information about the video’s context (CC) along with either a final answer prediction or a tool call to be executed before the next step. At every subsequent step inStage-2, SAGE-MM uses the video context (CC) and the tool call results from previous steps to decide either to predict the final answer or call another tool in an iterative reasoning process.",
