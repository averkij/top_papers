The main denoising UNet performs the denoising process to generate the final output. The BrushNet branch extracts features from masked images, which are added to the main denoising UNet layer by layer after a zero convolution block. Temporal attention is incorporated after self-attention and cross-attention to improve temporal consistency.",
