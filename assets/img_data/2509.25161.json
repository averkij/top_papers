History corruption(Chen et al.,2024; Guo et al.,2025)in (a) compromises temporal consistency, while planning generation(Zhang & Agrawala,2025; Xiang et al.,2025)in (b) is incompatible with sequential streaming video generation. Self Forcing(Huang et al.,2025)in (c) can achieve consistent sequential streaming but suffers from severe error accumulation while generating long videos. The proposed Rolling Forcing in (d) supports streaming long video generation with superior temporal consistency and minimal error accumulation.",

Rolling Forcing jointly denoises a short window of consecutive frames that are assigned progressively higher noise levels and connected by bidirectional attention. The KV cache of recent frames is preserved as temporal context to maintain short-term consistency, while the KV cache of the initial frames is preserved as global context to ensure long-term consistency. During training, only a subset of denoising windows requires gradient computation, as highlighted by the red windows. These windows are mutually exclusive yet collectively cover all video frames.",
