Human experts provide pairwise preference annotations based on usefulness, coherence, completeness, and alignment.(b)Given a query and its preferred and rejected reports, we train a rubric generator via GRPO to produce weighted evaluation rubrics, with rewards based on preference consistency, LLM-as-a-judge scores, and format validity.(c)Multi-Agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow. A shared policy executes a structured workflow with search, chunking, state update, and report generation, interacting with external tools. Query-specific rubrics are used to compute rewards of the rollout reports under an individual query.",
