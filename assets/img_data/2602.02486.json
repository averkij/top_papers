Unlike the traditional ReAct paradigm, where multiple rollouts are executed in isolated silos without experience sharing, RE-TRAC is an iterative, trajectory-level framework. It employs a compression mechanism to distill analytical conclusions, evidence, and uncertainties from previous attempts. This compressed context is then propagated to successive rollouts, enabling the agent to recursively reflect on its trajectory and progressively improve its exploration strategy.",
