By adaptively revealing informative cells (green) and skipping others (hatched), it maintains confidence intervals for the total score.\nThe algorithm terminates as soon as a positiveseparation gapemerges: the Lower Bound of the weakest winner (Sports) is strictly higher than the Upper Bound of the strongest loser (Auto).\nThisenablesthe identification of the correct Top-KKranking while saving 60% of the query-time computations.",
