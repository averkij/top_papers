Solid and dashed arrows represent the trajectories of our proposedEpiCaRand the STaR baseline, respectively. While standard iterative SFT often incurs a trade-off (Calibration Cost Zone), our method consistently drives diverse model families (Llama-3 and Qwen-3) into thePareto-Superior Zone, achieving simultaneous gains in both task performance and uncertainty calibration.",
