Each node‚Äôs position is determined by its tree level and cell center.(d)The proposed 2-level subtree compression further reduces the octree tokens by up to 8x (4x in the illustrated quadtree).(e)The masked next-token prediction mechanism effectively addresses the challenge of dynamically varying token positions.(f)Uni-3DAR unifies multi-frame 3D structural generation with token-level and structure-level understanding tasks in a single model, assigning each token a distinct role.",
