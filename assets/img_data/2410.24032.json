At the top is the CARE System, displaying the Conversation Panel, Solution Panel, and Needs Panel. The CARE System actively prompts the user, gathering their needs before creating a tailored plan. In contrast, the Baseline System, shown at the bottom right, features only a Chat Panel and tends to provide direct answers to the user’s queries.",
