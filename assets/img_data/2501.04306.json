This cyclical process begins with scientific hypothesis discovery, followed by experiment planning and implementation, paper writing, and finally peer reviewing of papers. The experiment planning stage consists of optimizing experiment design and executing research tasks, while the paper writing stage consists of citation text generation, related work generation, and drafting & writing.",
