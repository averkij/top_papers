                "caption": "Figure 1:MATH-Beyond: Benchmark Construction and Difficulty.Left:Schematic of the MATH-B creation process. A large set of problems from DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR is first refined through quality filters to ensure answer correctness and verifiability. This is followed by evaluation against a gauntlet of open-source base models (≤\\leq8B, e.g., Qwen3, Qwen2.5 (-Math), DeepSeek-R1-Distill) at apass@1024budget to isolate problems that lie beyond their limits. The filtering yields theMATH-Bsuite of benchmarks: a 41-problem intersection set (unsolved by all base models) for evaluating universal difficulty, and a larger 181-problem union set (unsolved by at least one model) with model-specific splits for targeted analysis. This suite provides a rigorous testbed to drive the development of exploration methods for RL.Right:An illustration of MATH-B’s significant difficulty compared to common test sets like AIME24. Representative open-source models like Qwen2.5 achieve near-zeropass@1024scores on MATH-B, highlighting its difficulty. Qwen2.5 results are fromYue et al. (2025).",
