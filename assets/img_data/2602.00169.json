In these processes, certain level of generalization is expected. The pre-trained and MatSci-tuned LLMs serve as the unified memory. The agentic LLM mostly acts as the search operator interacting with the environment, but it can access and store information during interaction into the memory. The agentic LLM can employ the search operator to interact with either the virtual world (e.g., a simulator) or the real world.
