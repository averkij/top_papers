                "caption": "Figure 1:(a) Our Pipeline:After using the (instruction) generator to label paths for data augmentation in navigator training, we leverage the trained navigator to filter high-quality data to train a better generator, and the improved generator refines the data pool to train a stronger navigator, iteratively running on the flywheel.(b) Comparison with state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods: Our approach significantly outperforms SoTA on all tasks. It alsosurpasses human performanceon R2R and approaches human-level results on RxR-English and CVDN (for other tasks, human performance is not reported in their paper). The R2R result is from the test set, while others are from val unseen.",

Then the navigator filters the data for further use.\n(b) In filtering, the navigator re-runs instructions to compute the path-path similarity score (nDTW & SPL). High-fidelity data is kept for training while low-quality data will be refined.",
