The inherent discontinuities of depth near object boundaries often propagate into distorted 3D point clouds (top left) and degraded rendering (bottom left). Our PM-Loss addresses this by using the prior from pointmap, achieving higher-quality geometry (top right) and rendering (bottom right).",

This estimated point map then serves as direct 3D supervision for training a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting model. Crucially, unlike conventional methods relying predominantly on 2D supervision, our approach leverages explicit 3D geometric cues, leading to enhanced 3D shape fidelity.",
