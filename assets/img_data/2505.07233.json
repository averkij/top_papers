Figure (a) represents a RAG system without a reranker, where the system primarily focuses on training LLMs. Figure (b) represents a RAG system with a reranker, where the reranker is trained to filter the Top-N documents to a fixed Top-K, which remains constant for all queries. In contrast, Figure (c) represents our dynamic reranker, where both the reranker and the generator are trained simultaneously. The dynamic reranker adapts to the difficulty of each query by dynamically determining the value of k.",

First, we retrieve the Top-N documents based on the given question. Then, we use an expert model to score each document and filter a subset of data for behavior cloning by the dynamic reranker. Next, we use the trained dynamic reranker to sample multiple different trajectories. The responses generated by the generator serve as rewards to evaluate the quality of the trajectories, and we select the trajectory pairs with the highest and lowest rewards as the training data for DPO. During the inference phase, DynamicRAG only require two LLM inferences.",
