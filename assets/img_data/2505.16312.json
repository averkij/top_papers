Given multiple candidate steps generated by an LLM, standard methods like embedding similarity or Levenshtein Ratio may incorrectly assess candidate 1 and candidate 2 as highly similar due to surface features, while failing to recognize the true semantic equivalence between candidate 2 and candidate 3, which represent the identical logical operation.",
