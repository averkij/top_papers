See Figure3for a visual representation of evaluator choices. The score is the mean of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, BLEU-1, and BLEU-4. Here the generators (summarizers) are Gemma 3, Phi 4 mini, Mistral, Llama 3, and GPT-4o mini (i.e. no Qwen 3). For Llama 3 8B and Mistral, additional summaries are generated with different prompts to ascertain possible patterns in higher-scored summaries.\nFurther breakdowns for the variants Llama and Gemma can be found in Figure7.",
