We aim to distill a multi-step multi-view teacher generator (right, green) into a few-step multi-view generator (left, blue). Our few-step MV student generator is conditioned on Plücker embeddings for better 3D awareness. Similar to[59], we optimize the student generator using distribution matching objective (DMD loss) and train the fake score function to model the distribution of samples produced by the student generator. In particular, we integrate two teacher models: multi-view teacher and single-view (SV) teacher to enhance both multi-view consistency and photorealism. The MV score functions take a set of images of one object as input and calculate the MV DMD loss, while the SV score functions treat each image separately and calculate the SV DMD loss.",
