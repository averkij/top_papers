With more reasoning tokens, Heimdall gives more accurate judgment on the solutions on AIME2024.Middle:the verification accuracy scales with repeated sampling and Majority Voting. By sampling multiple verification trajectories and voting, the accuracy can be further improved.Right:with Heimdall scoring the solutions on AIME2025, the problem solving accuracy scales with the number of solutions. We verify16161616times on each solution and select the most likely correct one with Pessimistic Verification(×16absent16\\times 16× 16). When inter-playing with various solver models, Heimdall gives significant improvements over pure solver-based Majority Voting(MV).",
