The range4≤n≤164\\leq n\\leq 16has been the most intensely studied, with decades-long progress driven by lattice and non-lattice constructions (seeD4D_{4},E6E_{6},E7E_{7},E8E_{8},K12K_{12}, Barnes-Wall, Leech, and others). Our model-based AI approach (blue stars, 2025) achieves new state-of-the-art bounds throughout this critical band of dimensions, surpassing all previously known constructions.",

The process begins with the choice of two nonnegative geometric parameters(r,R)(r,R)withR>rR>r.\nGiven these parameters, one constructs the function classℱ​(r,R)\\mathcal{F}(r,R).

(1) The agent begins by using Bayesian optimisation to propose geometric parameters(r,R)(r,R), updating a surrogate model from past evaluations and trading off exploration versus exploitation. (2) Given this choice, it constructs the admissible vocabulary of polynomial building blocks associated withℱ​(r,R)\\mathcal{F}(r,R). (3) Monte Carlo Tree Search then explores combinations of these building blocks to assemble candidate SDP formulations that are predicted to yield stronger bounds. (4) The resulting SDP is solved to obtain a certified upper bound, which is added to the dataset and used to guide the next iteration. Through this closed feedback loop, the agent actively selects both the geometric parameters and the polynomial structure of the certificate, enabling it to discover progressively tighter sphere-packing bounds.",

The shaded red region denotes the neighbourhood of(r,R)(r,R)values where the tightest bounds have been achieved.
