TheMatrix-learning process is designed to learn an adaptive transition rate matrix, which facilitates the estimation of an adapted latent distribution. Concurrently, thescore-learning process focuses on estimating the probability ratio necessary for constructing the inverse transition rate matrix, thereby enabling the reconstruction of the original data distribution.",
