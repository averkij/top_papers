The right panel shows that DeepScientist achieves progress in two weeks that is comparable to three years of human research(Su et al.,; Bao et al.,a;b; Hu et al.,2023)(left panel). All zero-shot methods, including the system-generated T-Detect, TDT, and PA-Detect, uniformly adopt Falcon-7B(Almazrouei et al.,2023)as the base model. Additionally, all methods produced by DeepScientist demonstrate higher throughput than the previous SOTA method, Binoculars(Hans et al.,2024).",
