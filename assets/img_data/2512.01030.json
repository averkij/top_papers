While averaging is employed to mitigate the variance, the final prediction remains compromised by the blending of conflicting structural hypotheses. In contrast, the deterministic formulation (Deterministic-DA) ensures a noise-free and stable trajectory, preventing structural variance and improving geometric coherence and prediction accuracy.",
