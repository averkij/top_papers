Iteration functions as an internal deliberative cycle, employing self-correction mechanisms like consistency checks to refine hypotheses without external tools. The agent utilizes parametric memory as an internalized medical curriculum for reasoning, while non-parametric memory employs context extension techniques to maintain coherence.

Action execution serves as the core mechanism for evidence acquisition, performing three distinct epistemic operations. Non-parametric memory acts as an evidence boundary, strictly buffering the retrieved snippets to prevent contamination, while parametric memory synthesizes this grounded evidence into a fluent response with traceable citations.

Non-parametric memory maintains a verifiable log of these executed actions for state tracking, while parametric memory acts as a query engine to translate intents into precise tool calls.
