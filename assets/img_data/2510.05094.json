Pins deform unnaturally, visual artifacts appear, and later frames become unstable, indicating poor spatial consistency.\nIn contrast,VChain (Ours)produces a coherent and physically realistic sequence: the ball strikes the pins with plausible force, leading to consistent knockdown. Object geometry and material properties are well preserved across frames. These results show that VChain not only enables causal reasoning about the outcome of physical interactions, but also stabilizes spatial transitions.",

In contrast, VChain leverages the reasoned Visual Thoughts to render step-by-step intermediate visual states of the throw-and-catch process.(2) Without Sparse Tuning:While Visual Thoughts are included, the model performs direct frame interpolation without tuning, leading to warping artifacts due to spatial misalignments among individual frames in Visual Thoughts. VChain (Ours) produces the most coherent and physically grounded interaction, correctly depicting the ball being thrown and caught from a first-person perspective. Removing either component degrades video synthesis quality.",
