                "caption": "Figure 1:Comparison between the pixel-aligned feed-forward method and our approach.Pixel-aligned feed-forward 3DGS methods suffer from two primary limitations: 1) 2D feature matching struggles to effectively resolve the multi-view alignment problem, and 2) the Gaussian density is constrained and cannot be adaptively controlled according to scene complexity. We propose VolSplat, a framework that directly regresses Gaussians from 3D features based on a voxel-aligned prediction strategy. This approach achieves adaptive control over scene complexity and resolves the multi-view alignment challenge.",

Depth Prediction Module then estimates a depth map for each view, which is used to unproject the 2D features into 3D space to form a voxel feature grid. Subsequently, we employ a sparse 3D decoder (details in Sec.III-C1) to refine these features in 3D space and predict the parameters of a 3D Gaussian for each occupied voxel. Finally, novel views are rendered from the predicted 3D Gaussians.",

Since the density must remain uniform, it cannot learn the complex geometry of the corners of the washbasin in the center and forces the Gaussians to be distributed to unnecessary edge areas. VolSplat is more realistic and reasonable.",
