A direct answer and its soundness proof can be extracted. D-FPS: The whole process is further decoupled into a forward-solving part and an optional backward-proving part. Forward-solving enforces deductive reasoning for better human readability. The direct answer and the completeness proof can be extracted upon finishing forward-solving, while the soundness proof should be extracted after finishing backward-proving.",
