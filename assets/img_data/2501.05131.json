Specifically, 3DIS-FLUX employs the state-of-the-art FLUX model for rendering, which is capable of producing superior image quality and offering enhanced control.",

During this process, 3DIS-FLUX incorporates an Attention Controller to ensure the accurate fine-grained attributes of each instance.",
