Faced with a harmful query, the model initially refuses (Reward: 1). Our reward-based RL-PGD optimization gradually softens the model’s stance (Reward: 5) until it produces a successful jailbreak response (Reward: 10). The right panel (Stage 2) shows the Payload Injection process. This discovered text is used as the target for a PGD attack, which embeds it as an imperceptible perturbation into a benign audio carrier. The final audio is perceived as a harmless weather query by a human but causes the target ALM to output the malicious content.",

External targets, such as responses from other models or datasets, lie outside this space, making them impractical to reach efficiently.
