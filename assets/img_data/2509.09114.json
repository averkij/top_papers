In contrast, (b) introduces Local Alignment and Global Alignment modules to establish a direct, one-to-one correspondence between visual and textual features.",

(i) The local alignment performs fine-grained matching between local features of images and text. (ii) The global alignment ensures consistency between different modalities at the level of global distribution. (iii) The dimensionality reduction mechanism was introduced before alignment to compress high-dimensional visual features and reduce memory overhead.",
