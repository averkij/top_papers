(b) A visualization of the upsampling step, where selected latents are upsampled using nearest-neighbor interpolation. (c) We add correlation noise to the upsampled latent to match the noise level, and design the noise and timestep schedule such that the divergence between the target timestep distribution (Eq.¬†(8) and the modified distribution (Eq. ¬†(9) is minimized (see ¬ß4.2).",
