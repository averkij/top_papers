The compressor is jointly optimized with the DiT backbone to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with constant computational cost.(b) Uncertainty-Aware Action labeling:Continuous poses are decoupled into translation and rotation primitives. A tri-state logic filters out “Uncertain” motion to ensure robust action-response learning.(c) Data Strategy:Pre-training on open-domain video is followed by finetuning on a revisit-dense dataset to activate 1000-frame memory consistency.",
