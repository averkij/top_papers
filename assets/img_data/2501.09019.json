The whole framework (a) contains three key components: coherent tail latent sampling in queue manager , (b) Subject-Aware Cross-frame Attention (SACFA), and (c) self-recurrent guidance.\nThe coherent tail latent sampling in queue manager derives the enqueued frame latents at the queue tail to improve structural consistency.\nThe Subject-Aware Cross-frame Attention (SACFA) aligns subjects across frames within short segments for better visual coherence.\nThe self-recurrent guidance leverages information from all historical cleaner frames to guide the denoising of noisier frames, fostering rich and contextual global information interaction.",
