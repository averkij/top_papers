                "caption": "Figure 1.Examples of the gameplay and discussion phases ofAmong Us. During gameplay, all agents navigate a 2D grid environment (a 1-by-2 grid in this case, with two rooms at (0,0) and (1,0)), where agents can see everything in their same room. Here, the red, green, and yellow agents are in room (1,0), and the purple and blue agents are in room (0,0). Crewmates can perform tasks (indicated by the stars – in this example there are 3 tasks), while imposters kill crewmates. Here, the orange and green agents are working on tasks. Agents can also report dead bodies, as the purple agent is currently doing, which initiates the discussion phase. During discussion phases, agents leverage large language models to generate free-form messages guided by our framework encouraging effective speaking and listening within the crewmates and finally vote out a suspected imposter. The example discussion shown on the right is based on a generated discussion from our trained models.",
