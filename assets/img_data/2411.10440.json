In contrast, our Stage-level Beam Search generates candidates for each reasoning stage (e.g., summary, caption, reasoning, and conclusion) and selects the best option at each stage. Best-of-N search operates at a coarse level, while Sentence-level Beam Search is overly granular, and our method achieves an optimal balance and achieves the best performance.",
