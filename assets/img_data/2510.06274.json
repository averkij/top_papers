                "caption": "Figure 1:Complexity out-of-distribution generalization evaluates whether models trained on problems whose solutions require few, shallow steps generalize to problems whose solutions demand substantially more steps and deeper composition. Two instantiations are shown. Top-Roman numerals: training solutions involve short additive/subtractive decompositions; test solutions require many more operations to expand more complex numerals. Bottom-Visual Question Answering: training features few-hop questions in a simple scene; testing uses relational, multi-hop questions in a busier scene with more entities. The shift is in solution complexity (and, for VQA, scene clutter), not in domain or content.",
