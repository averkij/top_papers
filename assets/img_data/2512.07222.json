On the existing process of attention calculation, which usesℱV\\mathcal{F}_{V}andℱT\\mathcal{F}_{T}, we add a parallel pipeline to calculate the attentions between function wordsℱTf\\mathcal{F}_{T_{f}}and the imagesℱV\\mathcal{F}_{V}. Afterwards, the function-attention passes a control gate𝒢\\mathcal{G}before entering the FDA module (triangle) differentially to subtract distractions as presented in Eq.6.Right:We speculate that attacks can easily cross the boundary for misalignments for less aligned models (top), and by removing function-word distractions, models can learn a robust embedding (bottom), preventing misalignments.",

However, some distractions still exist and remain visible.Right: Attention probabilities with two subtractions show the cleanest attention maps and have the most negligible distractions, with only strong activations on the most relevant visual tokens, i.e., with higher probabilities.",
