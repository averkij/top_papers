This framework assumes that the agent’s action is driven by its reward function, forming a pair(a,r)𝑎𝑟(a,r)( italic_a , italic_r )that serves as acontractbetween the agent and the principal. However, this contract is incomplete. To address this incompleteness, we explore societal alignment mechanisms of social, economic, and contractual alignment as guiding principles for LLM alignment in the incomplete contracting environment.",
