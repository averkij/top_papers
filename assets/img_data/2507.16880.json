Without any mitigation technique applied (1st row), the generated images clearly indicate data replication.

After localizing and pruning weights with NeMo (3rd row) or Wanda (4th row), data replication appears effectively prevented. However, identifying adversarial embeddings with Dori—indicated by—reveals that embeddings capable of triggering data replication may persist, even after pruning. Finally, our adversarial fine-tuning (5th row) successfully removes memorized content and prevents data replication. N/A denotes not applicable.",
