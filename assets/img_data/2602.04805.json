By leveraging SkinTokens, i.e., our novel, discrete representation for skinning weights, our method robustly generates high-fidelity skeletons and precise skinning maps (visualized as heatmaps) for complex, real-world geometries, ranging from stylized anime characters to quadrupeds and fantasy creatures.Project Page:https://zjp-shadow.github.io/works/SkinTokens/",

                "caption": "Figure 2.Overview of the TokenRig Framework.Our method consists of three key stages:(1) Learning SkinTokens (Section3.2.2):We first train a FSQ-CVAE(Kingma and Welling,2013; Sohnet al.,2015; Mentzeret al.,2023)to compress sparse skinning weights into a compact, discrete representation. Mesh geometry and skinning weights are processed by VecSet(Zhanget al.,2023)encoders, and the resulting features are discretized into SkinTokens via Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ)(Mentzeret al.,2023). We employ nested dropout(Bachmannet al.,2025; Rippelet al.,2014)and importance sampling to ensure robust reconstruction of active deformation regions.(2) Unified Autoregressive Modeling (Section3.3):We formulate rigging as a sequence generation task. A Transformer generates a single, unified sequence comprising the complete skeleton followed by the learned SkinTokens (from Stage 1), conditioned on global shape embeddings to capture structural dependencies.(3) RL Refinement via GRPO (Section3.4):To improve generalization to in-the-wild assets, we fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)(Liuet al.,2024). We introduce four specific rewards: Volumetric Joint Coverage (ensuring bone distribution), Bone-Mesh Containment (preventing protrusion), Skinning Coverage and Sparsity (ensuring valid weighting), and Deformation Smoothness (preventing artifacts during animation).",
