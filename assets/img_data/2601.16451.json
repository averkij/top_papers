Three representative H&E patches and corresponding tumor segmentation overlays from TCGA colorectal cancer cases illustrating low, intermediate, and high Tumor Interation Score (TIS).Risk score represents a relative risk ranking derived from our survival model and is independent of sign; higher risk values indicate worse survival outcomes. TNM denotes Tumor–Node–Metastasis staging.a, The low TIS case is characterized by pronounced tumor budding and infiltrative growth at the invasive front, extending toward the serosal surface, consistent with poorly differentiated tumor and elevated clinical risk.b, The intermediate TIS case exhibits a well-demarcated tumor boundary with prominent lymphocytic infiltration in the surrounding stroma, reflecting spatially confined tumor growth and the lowest predicted risk among the examples.c, The high TIS case corresponds to a large, highly cohesive tumor mass with extensive tumor area, where excessive tumor burden is associated with a renewed increase in predicted risk.",
