In the first stage, Garment Priors Evolution is utilized to fine-tune GarmentDiT for enhanced clothing feature extraction. In the second stage, we customize the DiT blocks through structure slimming, garment condition modulation, and high-resolution garment feature injection, resulting in DenoisingDiT for the try-on. DenoisingDiT is trained jointly using frequency loss and denoising loss.",
