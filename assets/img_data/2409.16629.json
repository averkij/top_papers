Our system performs two-hand policy training in two steps. First, we decentralize the control of two hands, and train the left-hand policy for fret pressing (orange box) and the right-hand policy for string picking (blue box) independently in a decentralized manner. Then, we lock the previously trained single-hand policies, and introduce a synchronizer to coordinate the behaviors of single-hand policies in a centralized training environment to obtain a joint policy for two-hand control.\nThe synchronization is achieved quickly by modifying single-hand policies’ behavior patterns through latent space manipulation.",

Given a common guitar chord spanning at most four frets plus two additional conditions – open string (being picked without fret pressing) and mute string (not being picked to generate any sound) – for each string, there are nearly 900,000 chord combinations theoretically, which makes it difficult to be fully mastered. Each of our hand models has 16 links with 27 degrees of freedom (DoFs), where the wrist joint has 6 DoFs, the MCP joints have 2 DoFs with the exception that the thumb MCP having 3, and all the other finger joints have 1 DoF. The simulated guitar has a scale length of 24.5 inches (around 0.62m) in our implementation. In this work, we only consider the control of hands and assume that the guitar is fixed in the 3D space. We can obtain right-handed guitar-playing motions by mirroring the setup of the hand and guitar.",

For the pre-trained general-purpose policy, we show its evaluation performance using dashed orange lines. For the specifically trained policies, we show their training performance using dashed blue lines.
