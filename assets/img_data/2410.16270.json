To achieve desired outcomes, an intelligent agent must predict the external world states and behavioral consequences based on prior beliefs. Post-action, discrepancies between prediction and observation are perceived, prompting an update of prior belief. This update involves recalling the previous decision process and engaging in counterfactual thinking about un-chosen alternatives.",
