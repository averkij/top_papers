To bridge the offline-online domain gap, Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) is employed for unseen task exploration, with successful trajectories expanding HMS capabilities. The Hierarchical Planner retrieves Core Skills from HMS and decomposes task goals into sub-goals for Operator execution. The Decision Reflector leverages Execution Skills to assess task execution feasibility.",
