Each question and context is paired with a hallucinated answer and scored for grounded factuality via MiniCheck, then ranked by difficulty. In each batch, gold references (chosen) and top-ranked hallucinations (rejected) form preference pairs. These pairs optimize the DPO objective, ensuring training against vetted, high-quality negatives rather than arbitrary failures.",
