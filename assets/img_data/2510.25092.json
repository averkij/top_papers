                "caption": "Figure 1:The Agentic Information Flow of our SeeingEye  framework. The process begins with theTranslator Agent(left), which takes the previous state’s SIR and external feedback to perform a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) analysis. It uses tools to gather new visual evidence, reflects on the results, and iteratively refines the SIR. If the information is deemed sufficient (PASS), the improved SIR is passed to theText Reasoning Agent(right). The Reasoner performs its own CoT-driven analysis and tool use. Based on its confidence, it either produces a final answer (PASS) or generates targeted feedback (FAIL), initiating a new outer loop iteration for the Translator to gather more specific visual cues.",

(4) This refined SIR enables the Reasoning Agent to provide a high-confidence final answer in a single iteration.",
