Then, using both the description and the reference chart, an initial code is produced. 2) Iterative Refinement: In this stage, first comparing the chart generated from the initial code with the reference chart and produces a description of the difference. Based on this difference, the reference chart, and the description of the reference chart, a new code is generated and then get a new chart. This process is repeated iteratively. The iteration continues until convergence is achieved.",

The first refinement successfully recovered the missing text but introduced a color error. The second refinement corrected the color error without introducing any new issues. As a result, we obtained a chart with overall better performance compared to the initial version.",
