Our approach encompasses the latter two components.",

Two neurons at layers 7 (a) and 15 (b) show high values for the State of New York and Northern Ireland and very low values for northern Italy. A neuron at layer (c) 15 shows high values for several UK cities. A neuron at layer 31 (d) shows high values for the State of New York and Northern Ireland and diverse values for provinces in Italy.",
