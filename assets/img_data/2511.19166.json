We compare the similarity between the original (solid) and perturbed (dashed) decision boundaries and identify how manyTruestatements flip toNot Trueafter the perturbation (epistemic retractions) or, conversely, how manyNot Truestatements flip toTrue(epistemic expansions). Stable veracity representations should have well-clustered activations that minimize the number of epistemic retractions and expansions.",
