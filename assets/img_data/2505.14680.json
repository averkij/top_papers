(a) Web search retrieves and ranks results, presenting them as a Search Engine Results Page (SERP), where user feedback on the document level can be directly leveraged to update the ranking model. (b) Generative AI search automates multiple steps to generate direct answers, but its extended pipeline complicates the effective use of user feedback for refining individual components.",

NExT-Search introduces a dual feedback mechanism to enhance generative AI search: InUser Debug Mode, users can intervene at different stages—query decomposition, retrieval, and answer generation—to refine search results with granular feedback. InShadow User Mode, a personalized agent simulates user behavior to assist in providing feedback with minimal user interaction, reducing user engagement costs.",
