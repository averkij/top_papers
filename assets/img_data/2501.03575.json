The Cosmos suite of models includes both diffusion and autoregressive transformer models, which are trained using continuous and discrete latent representations of videos, respectively. Post-training these WFMs with specialized datasets enables them to be utilized in a wide range of Physical AI setups. Specifically, we present models with camera controllability, models capable of instruction-following for robotic manipulation, and models for autonomous driving scenarios.

Given the input frame and camera trajectory (color-coded temporally from red to violet), we compare Cosmos-1.0-Diffusion-7B-Video2World-Sample-CameraCond against CamCo(Xu et al.,2024)on the generated future frames as well as the re-estimated camera poses. CamCo suffers from the data distribution shift and often generates inaccurate trajectories or even out-of-distribution image syntheses that lead to un-estimatable camera poses. In contrast, the Cosmos camera control model can successfully generate future frames aligned with the camera control input while also maintaining high video quality and 3D consistency.",
