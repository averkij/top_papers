The planner (LLM) generates an initial action sequence based on the robotâ€™s skill pool and memory, while the critic (VLM) evaluates action feasibility and offers re-plan recommendations in response to environmental dynamics.",

In the case where no medication is found in an empty drawer, the planner does not halt its intent. Instead, the critic suggests exploring alternative locations and provides the correct advice to check other compartments of the drawer, thereby guiding the successful completion of the task.",
