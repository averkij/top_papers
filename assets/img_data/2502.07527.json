The blue, orange, and green bars correspond to the results for the small (1B), medium (8B), and large (8x7B) models, respectively. A better rank is indicated by the ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù bar. The 8x7B model achieves top performance in 19 tasks, while the 8B model excels in 3 tasks. 18 categories exhibited performance improvements with increasing model size (i.e., 8x7B demonstrated the best performance, followed by 8B, and then 1B), highlighting the potential of large foundation models for scientific applications.",
