                "caption": "Figure 1:Seed Diffusion’s inference speed is measured over H20 GPUs across eight open code benchmarks. Direct comparison with baselines is challenging due to differing test conditions: Mercury Coder was evaluated on a proprietary dataset with H100s, while Gemini Diffusion’s speed was averaged over a mixed-task benchmark using unknown hardware. Furthermore, reported speeds on these benchmarks can benefit from format-constraining system prompts. LiveCodeBench results are specifically on the 1055 problems from v1-v6 for the unknown baselines’ protocol.",
