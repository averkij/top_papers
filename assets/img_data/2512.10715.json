Boxplots for models with and without skip-connections show that both latent-space and node-wise predictive uncertainty increase with noise levels, eventually plateauing.(b) Predictive uncertainty for OOD detection on CheXMask. KDEs of the per-image uncertainty score show a clear separation between in-distribution and OOD images.(c) Correlation between uncertainty and segmentation quality.Across all source datasets from CheXmask-U, higher average uncertainty corresponds to a lower RCA-estimated Dice score, confirming that the measure captures prediction reliability.",
