This is also evident when we use Ray2[19]for motion generation even when using Kling for try-on.\nAlso, as the user’s right hand covers part of the garment, the information of the covered patterns is lost for the video generation model, leading to incorrect garment appearances when the hand moves in the video, for all baselines in(a)and(b).(c)OurDress&Dancegenerates high-quality virtual try-on results that faithfully preserve both garment and user appearance with precise motion, even when the hand moves off.",
