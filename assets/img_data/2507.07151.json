Given an image describing a dog surfing on the sea, the user may ask the question “What color is the ball?”. The model may hallucinate a response “The ball in the image is green”, while there is no ball in the image. We expect the model to recognize the conflict between the visual input and the textual input and give a response like “The image does not contain a ball”.",

The data construction process mainly consists of key components detection, components substitution, and answer generation. Prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by the modality conflict. The snowflake icon denotes that the MLLM is frozen, while the flame icon indicates it is fine-tuned.",
