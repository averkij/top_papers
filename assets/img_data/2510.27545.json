Color bar beneath each frame encodes per-frame energy predicted by the model, where a lower energy indicates a higher certainty in EBT-Policy. Notably, red (Step 7) marks the failure that triggers an EBT-Policy retry, while green (Step 11) marks the successful correction. Together, these steps highlight EBT-Policy’s interpretability and physical reasoning: using energy-based uncertainty to decide whether to continue or retry and how to adjust actions.Explaining Energy Minimization.EBT-Policy receives inputs (RGB frames, robotic proprioception, and language instructions) and assigns an energy to candidate action trajectories. Starting from a noisy initialization, the trajectory is iteratively updated by gradient descent on this energy, yielding starting states to a final executable plan. Optimization terminates when the energy converges to a minimum, as illustrated by the energy-landscape sketch.",

When Diffusion Policy drifts OOD (e.g., by missing the hook), it fails catastrophically, causing compounding error and eventually divergence. EBT-Policy, after failing to hook the first time, is able to recover, and retry hooking despite being in an OOD state. This is particularly challenging as EBT-Policy has never seen such data or been explicitly trained to recover from such failed states. We hypothesize this emergent retry behavior is due to the equilibrium dynamics of the energy function, which demonstrates the emergent reasoning capabilities of EBT-Policy.",
