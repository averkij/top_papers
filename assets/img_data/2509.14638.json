The left panel showcases the qualitative diversity of our 6 editing tasks, featuring representative examples from all 18 non-style-transfer editing types and several of the 38 style transfer operations. On the right, the sunburst chart outlines task distribution within MultiEdit, where the inner ring shows the 6 categories and the outer ring details the distribution of specific editing types. This dual perspective highlights the breadth and depth of challenging image editing scenarios covered in MultiEdit.",
