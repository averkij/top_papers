The spatiotemporal model is highly confident and geographically specific, and the fused posterior correctly recovers the prior’s top prediction with a high gating weight.Bottom:Neither the acoustic model (top prediction: Yellow-bellied Flycatcher) nor the spatiotemporal prior (diffuse over multiple warblers) is correct in isolation. However, adaptive fusion suppresses the acoustically dominant but ecologically implausible class, yielding the correct posterior prediction (Black-throated Green Warbler).\nIn both cases, the learned gating weight differs substantially across inputs, illustrating why fixed-weight fusion would fail to recover these outcomes.",
