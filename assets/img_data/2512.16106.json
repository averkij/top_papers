It illustrates the general-purpose pipeline for collecting, cleaning, and linking diverse tables, including the integration of a paper-level citation graph. Furthermore, it details how we construct a multi-level ground-truth for model relatedness by combining signals from paper citations, model lineage from model cards, and shared dataset metadata, providing a robust basis for evaluation.",
