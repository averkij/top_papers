Given the data table and question as input, (a) the baseline model, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct generates runnable visualization code, but the visualization is not aligned with the query as it shows the growth of renewables quantity instead of the share of total, leading to an incorrect answer. (b) Our RL-Text2Vis-14B produces a correct, query-aligned, and interpretable visualization.",
