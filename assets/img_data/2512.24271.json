The embedded context is then provided alongside the video to an MLLM to produce detailed captions and QA pairs. The dataset comprises three splits: DualityVidQA-SFT with real and counterfactual video-QA pairs (54K + 50K) for SFT; DualityVidQA-RL with 20K shared-question contrastive video-answer pairs (one question, two real/CF videos) for RL; and DualityVidQA-Test (600 pairs), which shares the same contrastive structure as DualityVidQA-RL and covers diverse counterfactual categories.",

Finally, we normalize the advantages across the dual groups to ensure balanced gradients.",
