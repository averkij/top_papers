The reward stems from the uncertainty of the frozen Multimodal Reasoner, computed by the consistency of its multiple generated answers. Bottom: In the Reasoner training stage, the Multimodal Reasoner is trained via GRPO on a curated set of challenging questions from the now-frozen Image-Conditioned Questioner, leveraging pseudo-labels from its own majority voting.",
