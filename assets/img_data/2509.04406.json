Based on it we propose two optimization objectives: velocity matching and velocity distillation. Velocity matching directly supervisesϕθ\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{\\theta}via matching the velocity fields between the student and teacher (Eq.13), while velocity distillation indirectly supervisesϕθ\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{\\theta}via matching the marginal distributions between the student and teacher (Eq.17).",
