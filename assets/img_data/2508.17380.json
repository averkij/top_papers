First, a two-step curriculum, called Motion Structure Induction (MSI), is designed to imbue the VIPER-R1 with the ability to deduce the latent symbolic structure of a system’s dynamics at stage 1. Subsequently, in stage 2, we employ reinforcement learning to “anneal” the model’s generation policy, sharpening its focus on producing topologically correct physical laws.",
