In most cases,models in the preferred architecture (e.g. encoders in MNLI) do better than the opposite architecture even with an order of magnitude greater size, e.g. a 400M decoder outperforming the 1B encoder. Notably, in generative tasks, decoders-from-encoders scale poorly with size, matching performance at small sizes but seeing a wide gap as model size grows. A table version of this plot can be found in Table8.",
