The selected frame, along with its pose and point cloud, is then passed to the back-end.\n(b)Backend:\nFor each new keyframe, aloop-detection moduleevaluates its similarity with previous keyframes. If a loop is detected, the most relevant candidates are refined and connected in the factor graph; otherwise, the keyframe is linked only to recent frames. Finally, global pose optimization is performed with Gauss–Newton, and other frames are adjusted accordingly.\nWe instantiate the matching module with MASt3R(Leroy et al.,2024b)and the loop-detection module withπ3\\pi^{3}(Wang et al.,2025b).",
