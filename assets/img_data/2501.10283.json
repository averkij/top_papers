For each frame, GSTAR first warps the previous frameâ€™s result using scene flow (Sec.3.2). It then reconstructs Gaussian Surfaces (Gaussian-attached mesh,Sec.3.1) by fixed-topology reconstruction (Sec.3.3). To handle topology-changing surfaces, GSTAR detects topology changes, unbinds Gaussians on these surfaces, and adds new Gaussians as needed (Sec.3.4). Finally, the Gaussian Surfaces are updated through re-meshing (Sec.3.5).",
