The LLM scores each attribute field of the generated description, and these field-wise scores are integrated into a caption reward to refine medical feature learning. In Stage 2, the model predicts disease categories based on learned representations. The LLM evaluates each prediction, and a customized reward function converts these evaluations into a final diagnostic reward that optimizes classification accuracy and ranking consistency.",

The frequency spectrum is then partitioned into disjoint groups based on frequency index (e.g.,𝐏1\\mathbf{P}^{1}corresponds to the central low-frequency components in blue, whileP2P^{2}corresponds to the peripheral high-frequency components in orange).\nTo generate a specific spatial basis𝐁1\\mathbf{B}_{1}, we retain only the learnable parameters belonging to Group 1 (𝐏1\\mathbf{P}^{1}) and mask all other frequency indices to zero. Finally, an inverse DFT (iDFT) reconstructs the spatial basis matrix. This design ensures that each basis𝐁k\\mathbf{B}_{k}specializes in a distinct frequency band, minimizing spectral redundancy.",
