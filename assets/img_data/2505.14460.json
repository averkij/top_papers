Given an image pair(xi,xj)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑥𝑗(x_{i},x_{j})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )with a shared text promptc𝑐citalic_c, VisualQuality-R1 generatesK𝐾Kitalic_Kresponses. Following GRPOshao2024deepseekmath, each response includes a detailed reasoning process and a predicted quality score. To assess relative visual quality, we calculate the asymmetric comparative probability that imagexisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPTis perceived better thanxjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPTunder the Thurstone modelthurstone1927law. This involves subtracting the mean predicted score ofxjsubscript𝑥𝑗x_{j}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPTfrom thek𝑘kitalic_k-th score ofxisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, standardized by their added sample variance.\nA fidelity reward is derived from human preference, providing continuous supervisory signals for policy optimization.",

At successive training steps, we generate multiple responses per image, compute the std of the predicted quality scores, and plot the average std across images. The uniformly downward trend confirms that VisualQuality-R1 becomes steadily more stable in assessing image quality as training progresses.",
