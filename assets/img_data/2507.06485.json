(2025)and ourVideo-RTS.While (a) Video-R1 uses a two-stage pipeline with SFT and RL, (b)Video-RTSadapts a pure-RL approach with output-based rewards for better data efficiency. We further enhance the reasoning ofVideo-RTSby proposing dynamic sparse-to-dense video test-time scaling. The format reward is omitted, as both models use it.",

If answers are in consensus, it returns an answer; otherwise, it samples denser frames.",
