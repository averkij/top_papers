During training, MotionPro first extracts the proposed region-wise trajectory and motion mask on the input video as the control signals. The multi-scale features are then learnt on these signals by a motion encoder, and further injected into the 3D-UNet of SVD in a feature modulation manner. Meanwhile, LoRA layers are integrated into all attention modules in the transformer blocks to improve the optimization of motion-trajectory alignment. In the inference stage, the region-wise trajectory and motion mask are first derived from the user provided trajectory and brushed region, and then exploited as the guidance to calibrate I2V video generation.",
