The critiques of current LLM critics (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) are overly superficial, primarily consisting of declarative statements rather than in-depth analysis or critical evaluation. In contrast, our critic can generate a deliberate reasoning process before making a judgment, incorporatingiterative evaluation,multi-perspective verification, andmeta-critiquing.",

In Stage 1, we first utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate an initial step-wise critique for each step in the solution, followed by an in-depth critique of the initial critique. Then, we use Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to merge these two critiques into one deliberate critique in the long-CoT form. Finally, we perform SFT on above created critique data to teach the model the format of deliberately critiquing. In Stage 2, we perform RL to the SFT model on either existing human-annotated data or auto-labeled data via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further stimulate the critique ability of the critic.",
