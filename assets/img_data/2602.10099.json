Our method, Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (+DiNO+RJF), achieves an FID of4.95using standard LightingDiT-B(yao2025reconstruction)architecturewithout guidance, significantly outperforming the VAE-basedLightingDiT-B(FID15.83). In contrast, applying standard Flow Matching to DINOv2-B features (+DiNO) fails to converge (FID21.64) due toGeometric Interference. Even restricting the noise to the hypersphere to strictly learn the angular component (+DiNO+SN) yields only marginal improvement (FID19.07), as the Euclidean linear paths still traverse the low-probability interior of the feature manifold.",
