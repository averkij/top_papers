We propose a two-stage framework that constructs and refines scene concept relations with the graph structure SceneConceptGraph, and aligns the outpainting model with the scene-specific prior during the ongoing painting process. We use colored dots and regions to represent scene concept nodes and their masks, and black and red lines in SceneConceptGraph to denote the initial and newly added relation edges. Here, we simplify the update process in the second stage, which is similar to the one in the first stage.",
