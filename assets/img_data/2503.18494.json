The models are evaluated in three categories: Complete, Instruct, and Average. Results indicate that deterministic decoding (Temp=0) generally leads to higher scores, particularly in the Complete category where Mistral Large Latest outperforms other configurations. Increasing temperature (Temp=1) negatively impacts performance across all categories, highlighting the trade-offs between deterministic and stochastic decoding in code generation tasks.",
