The MemoryOS latency was evaluated using FAISS-CPU due to compatibility issues on our computing platforms, thus representing a conservative estimate of its latency. (b) The right panel compares the average computational cost (in tokens) per interaction. Results demonstrate that O-Mem achieves a Pareto-optimal solution in both efficiency and overall performance. Note that we only performed token-control experiments on Locomo’s GPT-4.1 experiments. We did not control tokens for the experiments on GPT-4o-mini and the other two datasets.",
