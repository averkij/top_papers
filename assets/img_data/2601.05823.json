Unlike the direct alignment methods typically used during diffusion model training, this mapper network efficiently bridges the representation gap, enabling a seamless integration of semantic information. Notably, the usage of Send-VAE results in significantly more efficient and effective training of diffusion models.",

Experimental results on four VAEs with identical specifications indicate that these metrics do not accurately reflect the impact of VAEs on downstream generative performance. Conversely, we find that the ability of VAEs regarding low-level attributes is the key factor.",
