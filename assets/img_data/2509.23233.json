François de Bourbon-Montpensier was born in 1492 and received the title “duchy-peerage of Châtellerault” in 1515. However, the Wikipedia table “Duke of Châtellerault” incorrectly states that the title was created 23 years earlier. In fact verification, the corpus is assumed to be internally consistent, so the search may stop after finding one supporting piece of evidence. In inconsistency detection, the search continues to identifyanycontradictory evidence within the corpus.",
