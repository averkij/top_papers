The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus.

Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions.",
