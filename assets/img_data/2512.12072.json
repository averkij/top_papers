Each explorer explores a certain region of the manifold. Regions that are very similar to prior explorations are rejected by the central command which keeps track of a key set of salient regions explored (the anchor set). New explorers are encouraged to explore areas different from prior explorations (via prompt refinement).",

Note that “textual gradients” helps significantly in enabling the algorithm to have a lower rejection rate and also run faster (smaller number of timesteps) highlighting the importance of feedback and prompt refinement.",
