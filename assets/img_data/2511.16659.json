                "caption": "Figure 1.We propose PartUV, a novel part-based UV unwrapping method for 3D meshes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on local geometric priors and often produce over-fragmented charts, PartUV combines learned part priors with geometric cues to generate a small number of part-aligned charts. We evaluate our method on four diverse datasets—PartObjaverseTiny (man-made)(Yang et al.,2024), Trellis (AI-generated)(Xiang et al.,2024), ABC (CAD)(Koch et al.,2019), and Common Shapes(Jacobson and\ncontributors,2023)—and show that it produces significantly less fragmented UV mappings while maintaining low distortion on par with baseline methods. Leveraging part-aware charts also enables applications such as generating one atlas per part.",

By applying a clustering algorithm to this field, we obtain a hierarchical part tree𝒯\\mathcal{T}for the input meshℳ\\mathcal{M}. We then recursively traverse the part tree𝒯\\mathcal{T}starting from the root node. For each visited node𝒫\\mathcal{P}, we apply two novel geometry-based strategies to segment the corresponding part mesh into multiple sets of charts𝒞\\mathscr{C}. Each chart in the set is then flattened using the ABF algorithm(Sheffer et al.,2005), and its distortion is evaluated. If the distortion exceeds a user-specified thresholdτ\\tau, we recursively traverse the left and right children of the part tree𝒯\\mathcal{T}. Otherwise, we adopt the segmented charts and their corresponding UV mappings for the part mesh.",
