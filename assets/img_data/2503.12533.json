                "caption": "Figure 1:Overview of the Being-0 framework.The humanoid agent framework, Being-0, comprises three key components: (1) the Foundation Model (FM) for high-level task planning and reasoning, (2) the Connector, a vision-language model (VLM) that bridges the FM and low-level skills, and (3) the Modular Skill Library for robust locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Together, these components enable Being-0 to effectively control a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with multi-fingered hands and active vision, solving complex, long-horizon embodied tasks in real-world environments.",

The execution order proceeds left to right in the first row, then continues left to right in the second row. Images with yellow borders indicate decision-making points for the Foundation Model (FM). The yellow dialog boxes display the FM’s plans, the green boxes show decisions made by the Connector, and the blue boxes represent the skills called from the modular skill library.",

Being-0 w/o Connector frequently queries the FM, which often fails to provide correct plans due to its limited embodied scene understanding. In contrast, Being-0 with the Connector completes the task, requiring only a few queries to the FM.",
