The top and bottom rows shows results for MATH[7]and GSM8K[8], respectively. The left columns shows teacher accuracies under different sampling schemes, and the right column shows the performance of students distilled on traces sampled via these different sampling schemes. Notably, for the same teacher performance on both datasets, antidistillation sampling significantly degrades the performance of the distilled models relative to temperature sampling.",

One important feature of the blue temperature sampling curve is that to bring the student accuracy down below the undistilled accuracy, the teacher performance has to drop to 20%. On the other hand, with antidistillation sampling, the teacher model can still get 70% accuracy while producing traces that bring the student‚Äôs performs down below the undistilled accuracy.",
