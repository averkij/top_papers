By combining GRPO training with a cold-start initialization, it effectively reasons over instructions and visual inputs, significantly improving grounding performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on MIG-Bench and exhibits superior zero-shot performance on four reasoning-guided grounding benchmarks with an average 23.4% improvement.",

The second stage utilizes GRPO equipped with a difficulty-aware weight adjustment strategy in (b). The GRPO training process is illustrated in (c), where the policy model generates multiple responses, and each is assigned a distinct reward.",
