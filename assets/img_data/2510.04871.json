It starts with the embedded input questionxxand initial embedded answeryy, and latentzz. For up toNs​u​p=16N_{sup}=16improvements steps, it tries to improve its answeryy. It does so by i) recursively updatingnntimes its latentzzgiven the questionxx, current answeryy, and current latentzz(recursive reasoning), and then ii) updating its answeryygiven the current answeryyand current latentzz. This recursive process allows the model to progressively improve its answer (potentially addressing any errors from its previous answer) in an extremely parameter-efficient manner while minimizing overfitting.",
