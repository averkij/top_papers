Our system enhances the first and fourth steps, improving efficiency in prompt engineering and model selection.",

A dual-branch pipeline then generates/retrieves corresponding multi-view images, displayed in an interactive satellite view for 3D perception. Each candidate is automatically evaluated using eight-level semantic scores with heatmap visualization. For refinement, a score-guided recommendation mechanism suggests optimal keywords, enabling iterative optimization until user satisfaction is achieved.",
