                "caption": "Figure 2:Overall Pipeline.VideoGuide is a framework for enhancing temporal quality without additional training, leveraging the capabilities of any pretrained VDM. Throughout the denoising process of the sampling VDM, the guiding VDM receives an intermediate latent𝒛tsubscript𝒛𝑡{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{t}bold_italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPTand provides a temporally consistent sample𝒛t−τsubscript𝒛𝑡𝜏{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{t-\\tau}bold_italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - italic_τ end_POSTSUBSCRIPTby proceeding in its own denoising for a small number of stepsτ𝜏\\tauitalic_τ. The sample𝒛t−τsubscript𝒛𝑡𝜏{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{t-\\tau}bold_italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - italic_τ end_POSTSUBSCRIPTis then denoised and interpolated with the denoised𝒛tsubscript𝒛𝑡{\\boldsymbol{z}}_{t}bold_italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPTto produce a fused latent𝒛t′subscriptsuperscript𝒛′𝑡{\\boldsymbol{z}}^{\\prime}_{t}bold_italic_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Such interpolation only needs to take part in the first few steps of inference, and effectively guides samples towards a direction of improved temporal consistency. To further ensure model flexibility in refining high-frequency areas for better image quality, the latent𝒛t′subscriptsuperscript𝒛′𝑡{\\boldsymbol{z}}^{\\prime}_{t}bold_italic_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPTis passed through a Low-Pass Filter (LPF). Overall, VideoGuide is a straightforward addition to the original pipeline, yet it is powerful enough to significantly enhance temporal consistency without compromising imaging quality or motion smoothness.",

AD, VC, LV indicate guidance models of AnimateDiff, VideoCrafter-2.0, LaVie, respectively. Samples for the base model show substandard temporal consistency, especially regarding color fluctuation and subject appearance change. Applying FreeInit improves consistency but introduces degradation in imaging quality, such as smoothing out of textural details. In contrast, applying VideoGuide significantly enhances temporal consistency while preserving imaging quality, both for the self-guided case and the external model-guided case.",
