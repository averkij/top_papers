In the semantic learning stage, we train SemE on high-noise samples with consistency loss and temporal coherence loss as the learning objectives. In the detail learning stage, we initialize DetE with the weights of SemE and introduce a set of time-dependent layers and LoRA. DetE is then trained on low-noise samples, whereonly the newly added layers and LoRA are updated. The learning objectives in this stage include consistency loss, GAN loss, and Feature Matching loss.",
