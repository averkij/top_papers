Next, we attempt to identify the corresponding papers in a reference paper database using fuzzy matching on citation titles, and flag citations for which no matching paper can be found as HalluCitation candidates. Finally, we manually verify the existence of each candidate by referring to the original PDFs and conducting web searches. If it cannot be objectively identified, we mark it as a HalluCitation.",
