Instead of large-scale training for every ratio, (3) weighted model merging serves as a computationally efficient proxy to estimate performance for various mixture ratios. Finally, (4) a predictor is trained on the benchmarked proxy models to regress the relationship between mixing ratios and performance, utilizing iterative resampling to converge on the optimal mixture.",
