We LoRA-tune WAN 2.1[wan2025wan], a video generation model conditioned on an input image and a prompt. In our case, the input image corresponds to a painting, and the model learns to reconstruct the steps to paint it, starting from a finished painting to a blank canvas. In (b), the media transfer model is shown, which enables the video generation model to render any input image as an acrylic, oil, or pencil painting based on the text input. To achieve this, we generate variations of the reference image using image editing models and train the video generation model to reconstruct the original painting process.",

First, start and end frames are detected, and the painting canvas is localized. The video is then partitioned intoNNsegments, from whichMMframes are sampled per segment. Subsequently, occlusions (e.g., hands, brushes) are detected in the sampled frames, and a masked median is computed over the sampled frames, using the preceding median frame as a reference to remove transient obstructions. Finally, logos and text overlays are detected and removed (not shown in the figure), producingNNocclusion-free frames.
