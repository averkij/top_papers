The robot fleet streams on-policy rollouts to the cloud learner. Optional human interventions are triggered in failure or uncertain cases, providing corrected trajectories or actions that are incorporated into the streaming experience buffer. The cloud learner constructs task-balanced updates by mixing an online buffer with a static offline buffer, applies a plug-in post-training module (e.g., HG-DAgger/RECAP), and asynchronously broadcasts refreshed weights back to all actors to close a low-latency online training loop.",
