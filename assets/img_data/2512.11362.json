Building upon this, the second stage, Section3, traces the historical evolution of the field through its most representative works, providing context and intuition. The deepest stage, Section4, serves as the intellectual core, offering an in-depth analysis of the grand open problems and outlining actionable future research directions. The final section depicts the various applications, which are included in AppendixA.1.",
