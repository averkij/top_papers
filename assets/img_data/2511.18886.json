Given a single scene image and keyboard actions, MagicWorld interactively generates a dynamic world.\nAt each interaction step, the action-guided 3D geometry module produces action-driven point clouds, which are rendered into a point-cloud video and concatenated with the first frame of the current interaction and noise as inputs to the camera-based video DiT.\nMeanwhile, the current frame latent retrieves the three most similar historical latents from the cache, which are concatenated as history references.\nThe generated frames are finally decoded into video, and the history cache is updated accordingly.",
