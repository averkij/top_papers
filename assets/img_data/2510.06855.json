However, human segments event sequentially relying only on visuals available at the current moment. (b) The illustration of EST shows how humans perceive events. When we perceive visuals, we naturally expect continuous visuals to be recognized. When a significant difference from the given visual input occurs, we perceive it as an event boundary.",
