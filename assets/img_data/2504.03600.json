For each 3D image example, we visualize both 2D slices and 3D structures. For each video example, we visualize frames at different time points.b,MedSAM2 is a promptable segmentation network with an image encoder, a prompt encoder, a memory attention module, and a mask decoder. The image encoder extracts multiscale features from each frame or 2D slice. The memory attention module conditions the current frame features on past frames‚Äô features and predictions using streaming memory. The mask decoder generates accurate segmentation masks based on bounding box prompts and memory-conditioned features. This architecture enables MedSAM2 to effectively segment both 3D medical images and videos by exploiting spatial continuity across slices and frames.",
