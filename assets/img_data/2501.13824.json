We use LLMs to generate a textual description of the molecule based on its SMILES string. 2. The generated text, which contains hallucinations, is added to the prompt, and the LLM is tasked with predicting the specific property of the molecule. The answer is constrained to “Yes” or “No” to evaluate the LLM’s performance. We highlight obvious hallucinations that are unrelated to the input using colors.",
