MorphAny3D generates a smooth and high-quality morphing sequence between diverse object categories by leveraging the SLAT representation without any training. (b) Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA) fuses information from the source and target objects in the cross-attention layers to ensure the structural coherence and aesthetics of the deformation. (c) Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA) enhances temporal smoothness by incorporating SLAT features from the previous morphing frame into the self-attention mechanism, enabling smooth transitions over time. (d) An orientation correction strategy inspired by statistical orientation distribution patterns in Trellis-generated assets is proposed to resolve abrupt orientation shifts.",
