We use temperaturet=0洧노0t=0italic_t = 0.Bottom: For inference time scaling, we generate a number of candidate trajectories per task and select the best using a verifier trained on SWE-Gym. This approach demonstrates roughly logarithmic gains with the number of sampled solutions.t=0洧노0t=0italic_t = 0(excluded from regression) is used as the first hypothesis to be consistent with the top figure; later rollouts uset=0.5洧노0.5t=0.5italic_t = 0.5.",
