The agent may revise its plan when intermediate results warrant replanning.Right: The Mindset Experts comprise four heterogeneous modules—Divergent, Algorithmic, Convergent, and Spatial—each providing distinct cognitive capabilities. The bidirectional Context Gate mediates information flow: the Input Gate filters relevant history for mindset execution, while the Output Gate distills verbose reasoning traces into concise results for the main chain.",
