The left portion illustrates our Markov process where each stateQisubscriptùëÑùëñQ_{i}italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPTrepresents an atomic reasoning state derived through DAG decomposition and contraction from its predecessor. The right portion demonstratesAoT‚Äôs integration capability with existing test-time scaling methods (e.g., CoT, ToT). A key feature of this integration is that any intermediate stateQisubscriptùëÑùëñQ_{i}italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPTfrom our Markov process can serve as an entry point (Q0subscriptùëÑ0Q_{0}italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) for other methods, enabling flexible composition while maintaining answer equivalence with the original question. This design allowsAoTto function both as a standalone iterative framework and as a preprocessing module that can enhance existing approaches through structural optimization.",
