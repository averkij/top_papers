We use a single linear layer with MSE loss (cosine loss for normals). Predictive power from features to scene intrinsics saturates quickly both across blocks and across timesteps—around the 5th–15th of 50 timesteps and the 10th–20th of 30 blocks. Depth and normals are more easily predicted at earlier stages, whereas RGB prediction quality increases monotonically with both layer depth and timestep. Similar patterns are observed in nonlinear analyses (see the supplementary material), confirming that scene intrinsics can be captured quickly.",
