Body, face and hand poses are refined to be pixel-aligned. For faster initialization, clothing Gaussians and visual hull are obtained with Gaussian Reconstruction Models. These clothing Gaussians are embedded to SMPL-X mesh and adopt the local coordinate system of the triangle. Subsequently, the iterative optimization process (pruning, identity encoding and densifying) separates the body and garments. The learned identity encodings guide the densification of the clothing Gaussians.(b) 4D Animationare achieved by either direct driving of SMPL-X poses or leveraging video to learn extra clothing deformation. Given a driving video, we first obtain a static 3D Disentangled GS model. Body and clothing Gaussians are deformed by pose transformations. We then optimize a deformation network to learn extra deformations for clothing GS at different timestamps. Various(c) 3D/4D Editingoperations can be performed with our disentangled representation.",
