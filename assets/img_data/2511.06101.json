Some existing works choose to train on tasks from test set due to the scarcity of environment specific data. In contrast, this paper offers an approach for fully synthetic supervision to adapt agents to such new environment without human involvement.",

(2) Task Refinement during Trajectory Collection, which collects trajectories while refining task descriptions based on new observations to mitigate potential hallucinations. (3) Trajectory Refinement, which further improves collected trajectories using global context to edit noisy actions. (4) Agent Fine-tuning, which adapts the web agent to new environments under fully synthetic supervision. The right panel highlights the key advantage ofSynthAgentover baselines, i.e., the proposed dual refinement of both task and trajectory synthesis can lead to better synthetic data.",
