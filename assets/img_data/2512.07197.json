Each Gaussian is projected into the camera coordinate system and rendered onto the image plane through a differentiable tile rasterizer (Sec.2.1.3, Sec.2.1.4). The rendering is optimized by minimizing the difference between predicted and GT images (Sec.2.1.5). To improve reconstruction quality, adaptive density control clones or splits Gaussians based on view-space gradient signals while pruning nearly transparent Gaussians (Sec.2.1.6). In addition, efficiency-oriented strategies such as pruning, quantization, and entropy coding are applied to compress Gaussian attributes (Sec.3.1).",
