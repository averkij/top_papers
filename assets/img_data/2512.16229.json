In each iteration, LoPA generates a anchor branch alongside multiple lookahead branches (e.g.,B1,…,BkB_{1},\\dots,B_{k}) by independently sampling high-confidence positions from the baseline’s unfilled set. A branch confidence verification mechanism then evaluates all branches in parallel within a single forward pass, selecting the optimal path to maximize future parallelism.",
