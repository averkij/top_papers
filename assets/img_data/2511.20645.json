The imperfect reconstruction of VAEs used by FLUX[flux]and Stable Diffusion 3[SD3]produce severe and non-invertible distortions on the small details such as the scene texts on the wall, therefore the subsequent editing of the latent diffusion models fails. In contrast, by denoising directly in pixel space without a VAE, our PixelDiT avoids VAE reconstruction artifacts and helps maintain background consistency during local manipulations. For a fair comparison, all models are evaluated withnmin=0=0in FlowEdit to preserve more structures.",
