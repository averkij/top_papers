(c)Ellafirst generates a daily schedule according to the knowledge and experiences retrieved from the long-term memory, (d) then updates the memory based on visual observations of the environment, and (e) social interactions with other agents and (f) makes reactions accordingly including (f1) revising the schedule, (f2) interacting with the environment, (f3) and engaging in a conversation.",
