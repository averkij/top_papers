Performance of models trained on these rules is highlighted in the top row.Top:Model performance in relation to the Lempel-Ziv complexity of each rule. The left and center panels show efficiency (1 divided by number of epochs to reach 80% validation accuracy) for the easy and hard reasoning tasks, respectively. The right panel shows move prediction accuracy for the chess task. The rules depicted on the left are highlighted in the plot with triangles and annotated with the rule number. The correlation coefficient is shown in the top-left corner of each plot. An asterisk next to the value indicates a significant relationship (p<0.05𝑝0.05p<0.05italic_p < 0.05).Bottom:Downstream task performance based on Wolfram classification of each rule. Models trained on chaotic and complex rules perform better than models trained on uniform and simple rules.",

Periodic rules demonstrate a repeating attention pattern, suggesting that the model is learning to attend to earlier cycles of the same state rather than general state history.Right:Average attention across the final 10 states for all rules, plotted against Lempel-Ziv complexity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.66) indicates that models trained on higher complexity rules attend more highly to historical states during prediction.",
