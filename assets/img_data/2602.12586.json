                "caption": "Figure 1:Overview ofMcDiffuSE. We formulate slot selection as a sequential decision-making process optimised via Monte Carlo Tree Search. As illustrated in theStatisticsbox, the model’s greedy prior (P​(a=1∣s0)=0.37P(a=1\\mid s_{0})=0.37) favours immediately generating the function definition (i.e., slot22: “def get_max_length(words):”). However, through look-ahead simulations, the search algorithm discovers that starting with the syntax declaration (i.e., slot11: “‘‘‘python”) yields a higher long-term Q-value (i.e.,Q​(s0,a=1)=1.20Q(s_{0},a=1)=1.20for slot11vs.Q​(s0,a=2)=0.88Q(s_{0},a=2)=0.88for slot22), allowing the model to override the biased local prior and ensure global coherence.",
