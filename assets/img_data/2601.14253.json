The resulting latent tokens are decoded into a frame-wise 3D motion flow relative to the first video frame, producing temporally consistent 4D assets.",

For fair evaluation, we render the generated 4D assets from all methods into an orthogonal novel view. Our approach produces more temporally coherent and structurally consistent motion.
