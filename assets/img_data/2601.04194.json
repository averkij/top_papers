The converted 3D-GS models are then used to initialize a 4D representation (Sec.3.3). We iteratively refine this 4D representation by sampling camera poses at each iteration, rendering the corresponding videos, and passing them to the video generation model to obtain optimization gradients (Sec.3.2). Additionally, we compute regularization terms (Sec.3.4) to enforce spatial and temporal smoothness during the optimization process.",

As a result, no liquid can appear when prompted, since the system cannot generate newly emerging objects.",
