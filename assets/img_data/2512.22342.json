The agent has to locate a specific instance of the given category (chair). The agent can ask three types of questions—attribute, route, and disambiguation—to progressively resolve ambiguity and locate the target (instance). The full description in the bottom right is the instruction given to the agent in the ION task, which can locate the specific chair in this environment.",

We then pair each target instance with a start point to generate episodes. Finally, we collect dialog-augmented trajectories using a frontier-based exploration (FBE) agent that, with 90% probability, selects the frontier nearest to the previously chosen frontier and, with 10%, selects the frontier closest to the target (the “best frontier”). The attribute question is asked at the beginning of the trajectory, and the attribute is randomly chosen from one of the given attributes shown in the figure. The route question is asked when the best frontier is chosen. And the disambiguation question is proposed when an instance with the same category as the target is detected, the criterion of “detected” is that the GT semantic appears in the center of the image, and the instance is within 3 meters of the agent. The number following “#” indicates the corresponding number of cases. The ellipses indicate the potential inclusion of additional disambiguation, route, or attribute questions.",
