Due to mode collapse, these paths often exhibit high redundancy and tend to converge on the same incorrect answer.(Middle)OPE mitigates this by explicitly generating diverse outlines to partition the solution space into distinct directions (four different strategies). This structured exploration maximizes the coverage of potential solutions, enabling the model to successfully locate the correct reasoning trajectory.(Right)The OPE training pipeline consists of aCold Startphase using synthesized data, followed by a novelIterative RLstrategy.",
