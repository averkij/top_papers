The optimization process involves two parallel branches. In the top branch, only the prefix strokes are rendered by a differentiable rasterizer to create a partial sketch (e.g., a rabbit). This sketch is then guided by a pre-trained, frozen text-to-image diffusion model using a prompt corresponding to the prefix (“a rabbit”), resulting in the prefix SDS lossℒSDSprefix\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\text{prefix}}. In the bottom branch, thefull set of strokesis rendered to create the complete sketch (e.g., a horse). This is guided by the same diffusion model using a prompt for the full object (“a horse”), resulting in the full SDS lossℒSDSfull\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\text{full}}. The total SDS guidance loss is the sum of these two termsℒSDS=ℒSDSprefix+ℒSDSfull\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SDS}}=\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\text{prefix}}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\text{full}}.
