Results are validated on two independent frameworks (VeRL and Oat).",

The basic importance-weighted policy gradient algorithm in FP16 outperforms all baselines in BF16. Note that the third metric reported in each row slightly differs in implementation due to the use of separate codebases (VeRL and Oat). These metrics are semantically similar, and the minor differences do not affect our conclusions.",
