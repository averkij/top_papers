RGB reward models require near-complete denoising and VAE decoding to RGB space, introducingevaluation delay,GPU memory bottleneck, andinsufficient supervisionof early denoising stages where structure and motion are formed. PRFL eliminates these limitations by performing reward modeling directly in latent space with timestep-aware training.",
