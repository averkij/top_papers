Given an input imageIùêºIitalic_I, the feature extraction module outputs keypoint map, description map, and normal map through separate multi-task heads. During the training phase, we use the predicted depth map from the Depth Anything v2[21]to obtain pseudo normal label as a supervisory signal to assist in learning 3D geometric features. Finally, the 3D geometric-aware feature lifting module fuses the 2D and 3D features.",
