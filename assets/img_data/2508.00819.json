In contrast, the baseline is constrained to a fixed length for all problems.",

This difference is the result of subtracting the average confidence onlength-insufficientproblems (those answered correctly only with a much longer sequence) from that onlength-sufficientproblems (those answered correctly under 128 tokens). The experiment is conducted with LLaDA-Instruct-8B. The predominantly green color (difference>>>0) indicates that EOS confidence is higher for length-sufficient problems, validating our core insight.",
