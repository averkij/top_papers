                "caption": "Figure 1:Illustration of the “poisoned apple” example, in which Alice increases her payoff at Bob’s expense by releasing a new technology—without the players actually using that technology in practice. (1) The technologies available to Alice and Bob are language models A–D.\n(2a) For each possible market, the equilibrium in games between Alice and Bob under the market conditions is computed. For each equilibrium, the average fairness value that would be obtained if the equilibrium were played is calculated. (2b) The regulator, whose objective is to maximize fairness, decides that Market 4 will be the market in which Alice and Bob will play—the market that yields the maximum fairness value. Alice earns 0.49, Bob earns 0.50, and the fairness value is 1.00. (3) Technology E is released and is now available to both players. (4a) The process performed in2ais repeated.\n(4b) In the new equilibrium in Market 4, the resulting fairness value is 0.976. In the new equilibrium in Market 8, the resulting fairness value is 0.99. The regulator decides that Market 8 will be the market in which Alice and Bob will play. Alice earns 0.52, Bob earns 0.46.",

                "caption": "Figure 2:Strategic implications of technology expansion in meta-games. Analysis of equilibrium shifts across bargaining, negotiation, and persuasion environments. (A) Frequency of Opposite Payoff Changes: cases where expanding the technology set causes agents’ expected payoffs (calculated over mixed strategy equilibria) to move in opposite directions. (B) Opposite Payoff Changes Despite Zero Adoption: The subset of these reversals occurring even when the new technology is not selected by either player in the new equilibrium—demonstrating the ”Poisoned Apple” effect. (C) Frequency of Improvement in Regulatory Metric: How often the regulator’s optimized objective (Fairness or Efficiency) increases versus decreases. (D–E) The relationship between regulatory outcomes and model adoption: Improvements typically align with high adoption rates (D), whereas harm to the objective is frequently observed when the new model is available but acts as a latent threat without being played (E). (F) Frequency of Metric Harm Without Market Update: The probability of degrading the regulatory objective if the market design remains static (regulatory inertia) after the new technology is released. Confidence intervals (95%) are not shown, as all are narrower than 2 percentage points.",
