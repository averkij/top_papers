Given a user query, the agent starts the thinking process, where interaction with the environments such as tool calling would be invoked by generating a code snippet. The execution results will be appended to the agent’s context, enriching its understanding and informing its subsequent thinking. In this case, the agent invokes interactions for three times (search to get the GitHub link, parse to get the arXiv paper link, then parse to get the affiliation) until it arrives at the final answer.",
