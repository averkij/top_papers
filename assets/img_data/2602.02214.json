(a) Standard ODE distillation, which distills abidirectionalteacher to abidirectionalstudent, satisfies this requirement at the video level. (b) For anARstudent, injectivity must hold at the frame level: each noisy frame maps to a unique clean frame via the PF-ODE of theARteacher. (c) In contrast, Self Forcing distills anARstudent from abidirectionalteacher, where the same noisy frame corresponds to multiple distinct clean frames, violating\nframe-level injectivity and results in blurred videos after ODE distillation.
