Video-LLaVA concatenates tokens in a fixed order: 35 initial text tokens, followed by 256 visual embeddings, and then the remaining text tokens. In each map, the x-axis denotes attended tokens (keys), and the y-axis denotes attending tokens (queries). Color intensity reflects attention weight:blueindicates low attention,red/white indicates high attention, and dark (near-black) regions indicate masked or negligible attention due to causal masking in autoregressive LVLMs.",
