We then score these rollouts using fine-grained rubrics. Based on the reward trends from these rubrics, we dynamically select a pivot dimension for optimization and allocate weights. Finally, we eliminate conflicting samples that hinder optimization in the pivot dimension.",

It can be seen that after using multi-objective optimization, the reward always rises faster. Besides, the starting point of MOA-o is higher. This is because introducing thinking leads to a decline in generation quality. However, the growth of the MOA-o curve slows down in the later stages of training.",
