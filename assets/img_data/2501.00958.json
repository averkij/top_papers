Our multimodal textbook, sourced from massive tutorial videos, employs coarse-to-fine knowledge extraction and multi-level filtering to create a high-quality, textbook-level dataset. It interleaves video keyframes with tutorial texts (extracted from ASR and OCR), enabling VLMs to acquire rich knowledge through tightly coupled text-image and more coherent logic.",

We first instruct LLMs to construct a knowledge taxonomy, then retrieve and filter videos at metadata level, collecting 159K instructional videos. Then a video-to-textbook pipeline is designed for multi-level knowledge extraction. ① We filter out non-instructional videos using ASR transcripts, retaining 75K high-quality videos. ② We use ASR’s timestamp to segment long videos into short clips, discarding those with misaligned visuals and ASR. ③ We detect keyframes from each clip and extract text and symbols by OCR. Our pipeline produces 6.5M keyframes, 259M ASR, and 500M OCR tokens and organizes them into an image-text interleaved textbook.",
