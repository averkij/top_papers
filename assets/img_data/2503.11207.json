                "caption": "Figure 1:Analogical reasoning under perceptual uncertainty.In this figure, we highlight all the different axes of generalization and robustness to uncertainty, which I-RAVEN-X stresses. Compared to standard I-RAVEN(a), I-RAVEN-X(b)involves more panels per row (10 vs. 3) and larger attribute dynamic ranges (up to100×100\\times100 ×more values per attribute). This work introduces uncertainty in the reasoning process(c)through confounders (such as panels’ background and color patterns within objects) and smoothening the attribute values’ distributions (displayed on the right for the panel in position(1,10)110(1,10)( 1 , 10 )).\nTheRPMrules used in this example areconstantfor shape,distribute rightfor color,constantfor size, andprogressionfor number. We adopt a visual representation of the panels and their attributes for clarity of explanation; in practice, however, our dataset is purely symbolic and has not been extended yet to the visual domain.",
