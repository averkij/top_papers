Observations are projected into a shared discrepancy space (obs proj.), while ground-truth (for training) or predicted actions (for inference) are mapped into the same space (act proj.).\nFrom these two streams, the block estimates a transport-aware discrepancyDDand converts it into a gateg=ϕ​(D)g=\\phi(D), which softly modulates the backbone features before they are passed to the flow-matching action head.\nThe flow-matching head produces action trajectories from noise as in standard VLA models, and theDiG-Refinemodule can apply a small number of refinement steps entirely within the action head to further polish the predicted actions.(b)Given input embeddings, the backbone first applies standard attention.\nThe post-attention features are then normalized and fed toDiG-Block, which uses the act/obs projections to computeD​(μH,μZ)D(\\mu_{H},\\mu_{Z})and a gategg, and performs a gated residual update.\nThis design allowsDiG-Flowto modulate the high-level representation using discrepancy signals from actions, while keeping the pretrained backbone architecture and attention blocks intact.",

                "caption": "Figure 3:DiG-Flowdetects and suppresses shortcut learning through transport-guided gating.Flow matching transforms noise into actions, and multiple solutions can achieve low training loss. Some of these solutions correspond to semantically meaningful alignments between observations and actions (bluedistribution), while others exploit spurious correlations or shortcuts (reddistribution).DiG-Flowmeasures the Wasserstein distanceDDbetween observation and action features to distinguish these pathways. The gateg=ϕ​(D)g=\\phi(D)selectively modulates learning:Green path(DlowD_{\\text{low}}): semantically aligned features with low transport distance receive strong gates, reinforcing robust behavior;Yellow path(DmidD_{\\text{mid}}): intermediate features receive moderate gating;Red path(DhighD_{\\text{high}}): shortcut-like patterns with high transport distance are down-weighted, discouraging spurious solutions.\nThis geometric reweighting complements the flow-matching loss and helps steer optimization toward representations that remain stable under distribution shift. In this way,DiG-Flowpushes more intelligence toward the foundation model, making VLAs generate more robust actions for general manipulation.",
