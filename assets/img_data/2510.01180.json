The change is composed of two parts: the Sampled portion (left) always produces a nonnegative gain by promoting “sampled-correct” tokens (concentration measured byA2A_{2}) and demoting “sampled-incorrect” tokens (concentration measured byB2B_{2}), thereby shifting probability from theQnegQ_{\\mathrm{neg}}pool to theQposQ_{\\mathrm{pos}}pool. The unsampled part (right) is conditional: it can add or remove mass depending on the batch moodSRS_{R}and whether unsampled incorrect probability is more concentrated than unsampled correct probability. As the number of samples per promptNNgrows, the unsampled concentration termsUpos,2U_{\\mathrm{pos},2}andUneg,2U_{\\mathrm{neg},2}shrink, so the net effect tends towardΔ​Qpos≥0\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{pos}}\\!\\geq\\!0; the amount of mass moved scales with the pool sizesQposQ_{\\mathrm{pos}}andQnegQ_{\\mathrm{neg}}.",

We track (i) the total probability mass assigned to correct actions, (ii) the fraction of correct actions whose probability increased relative to step 0, and (iii) the worst negative change in probability among correct actions. LargerNNproduces more stable updates, faster accumulation of probability mass, and crucially it eliminates knowledge shrinkage by removing negative probability drops altogether.",
