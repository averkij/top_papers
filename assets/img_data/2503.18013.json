We illustrate the key step in one forward starting from inputting, generating all completions, calculating the reward with adjustment, to the final objective calculation and model update. Boxes in red indicate missed or wrong predictions, while the green ones are correct. Also, the solid line represents the predicted result, while the dashed line indicates the annotated ground truth.",
