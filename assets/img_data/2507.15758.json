The LAPO framework (left) trains a model in two stages: first discovering natural reasoning lengths, then internalizing them as self-proposed budgets. This process enables our models (LAPO-I) to achieve a state-of-the-art balance between accuracy and efficiency (right), surpassing existing methods by operating in the desirable top-left region of the performance plot.",
