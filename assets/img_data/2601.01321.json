The digital twin enables disease modeling and analytics as well as treatment simulation and personalization, generating actionable insights that support clinical decision-making and intervention. By closing the loop between data, modeling, and intervention, the framework facilitates virtual clinical workflows, operational trials and drug discovery, and accelerated research, ultimately improving patient care, reducing costs, and enabling personalized medicine.",
