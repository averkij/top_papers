The responding agent fails to provide accurate information in R1 and also fails to align with the user’s profile in R2, as indicated inred. (B) In a single-agent-based refinement, one agent manages all the refinement procedures. While some misalignments can be addressed, as indicated inblue, the result may still be suboptimal. (C) Our multi-agent-based refinement, where multiple agents, each focusing on a different aspect, collaboratively refine responses based on the set and sequence determined by a planner agent.",
