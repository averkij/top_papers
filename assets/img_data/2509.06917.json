Connecting an AI agent to the server creates a paper-specific agent for diverse tasks. (B) Workflow of Paper2Agent. It starts with codebase extraction and automated environment setup for reproducibility. Core analytical features are wrapped as MCP tools, then validated through iterative testing. The resulting MCP server is deployed remotely and integrated with an AI agent, enabling natural-language interaction with the paper’s methods and analyses.",
