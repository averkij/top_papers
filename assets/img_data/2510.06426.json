The outputs include: (a) an expert-written answer to the question by our annotators, and (b) clause-level attributions, which cover three aspects:Evidence(paragraph indices supporting the answer),Knowledge(entries from the provided knowledge list used), andCode(a Python snippet used to compute the numerical result when the answer involves calculations).",
