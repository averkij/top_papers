Given a text prompt and its corresponding generated image shown in the top left as input, DreamPolish first progressively constructs a fine-grained 3D geometry with\ncoherent and smoothed surface. Then, DreamPolish leverages DSD as the score distillation objective to guide the representation towards a domain with both consistent and photorealistic texture.",
