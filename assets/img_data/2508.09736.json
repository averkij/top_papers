The system consists of two parallel processes:memorizationandcontrol. During memorization, M3-Agent processes video and audio streams online to generate episodic and semantic memory. During control, it executes instructions by iteratively reasoning and retrieving from long-term memory. The long-term memory is structured as a multimodal graph.",
