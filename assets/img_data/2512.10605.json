Based on pre-defined prompts and user tasks, LLMs output content containing information, actions, and action parameters. The toolset can cover various domains according to actual scenarios and is required to provide basic information such as activation status, tool names, corresponding functions, and tool descriptions. Observations will generate diverse feedback content depending on different tools. During the iterative process, historical records (History) are continuously accumulated to support subsequent operations of LLMs.",

In the simulation environment, the UAV rotated sequentially to perform target detection. After completing identification, it reported the results to the user. Once the user specified a target, the UAV flew to its overhead position, and the task was successfully completed. In real-world experiments, the UAV also accomplished the task correctly: it located the target (trash can) and ultimately dropped the ball into it smoothly.",
