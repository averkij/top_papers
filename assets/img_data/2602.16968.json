Current methods use the same patch size foralldenoising steps during inference time.\nInstead,DDiTadapts the patch size at each timestep according to the latent complexity, allocating fewer tokens for certain timesteps and more tokens for certain others. While DiT divides VAE latents into patches, for illustrative purposes, we use a real image in pixel space.",
