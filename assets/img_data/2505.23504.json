VAU-R1, trained via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), consistently outperforms its Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) counterpart. This demonstrates that RFT enhances both reasoning and temporal localization capabilities in VAU tasks.",

Specifically, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize the model with task-specific rewards, such as answer format, accuracy, and temporal Intersection-over-Union (IoU). We decompose the VAU task into four complementary tasks to facilitate comprehensive reasoning: multiple-choice QA, temporal anomaly grounding, anomaly reasoning, and anomaly classification.",
