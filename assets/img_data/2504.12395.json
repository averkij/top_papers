The adapter consists of multiple stacked transformer encoders that incrementally refine character representations, enabling effective interaction with the latent space of the DiT. The training process employs a three-stage progressive strategy, beginning with unpaired low-resolution pretraining and culminating in paired high-resolution fine-tuning.",
