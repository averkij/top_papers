(Left) For each sample, the target VLM extracts instruction-conditioned early representations by aggregating the visual tokens that are most attended by the user instruction tokens in the first layer of the LLM, yielding a compact sample representation. (Right) The representations of all samples are stacked into a representation matrix, from which ScalSelect identifies the dominant low-rank subspace of the full representation space (the space spanned by the full dataset representations). Each sample is scored according to its contribution to this dominant subspace, producing an importance score distribution from which a compact subset of informative samples is selected.",
