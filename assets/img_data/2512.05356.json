Co-improvement is a bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI where each improves the other’s ability & understanding over time.\nUnlike self-improvement, which focuses on autonomous model updates, co-improvement centers on joint progress: humans help the AI achieve greater abilities, while the AI augments human cognition, research progress, and general capabilities outside of research.",
