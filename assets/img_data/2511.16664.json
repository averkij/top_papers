The accuracy shown is the average across all benchmarks: MATH-500, AIME-2024, AIME-2025, GPQA, LiveCodeBench v5, and MMLU-Pro.Right: Scaling analysis comparing Nemotron Elastic and Minitron-SSM as model family size grows. Nemotron Elastic maintains constant cost for tokens and deployment memory, while Minitron-SSM scales linearly.",

A budget (parameter size: 6B, 9B, or 12B) is selected and passed to the router, which generates differentiable masks for the student model. Knowledge distillation from the model prior to elastification enables simultaneous optimization across all budget variants.Deployment:After training, all models are extracted zero-shot from a single elastic checkpoint: the full 12B model and nested sub-networks (9B and 6B) are immediately available without additional fine-tuning or re-training.",
