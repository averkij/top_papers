                "caption": "Figure 2:Agent’s logic design. The context is used for both scheduling and generation. The scheduling prompt depends on calculating the agent’s messaging rate, compared to the average rate by other players – if the rate is higher, then the prompt has the tendency to favor waiting, while for the opposite case it favors sending a new message. Once the scheduler generates a decision (either “<wait>” or “<send>”), the agent interprets it by finishing the procedure and starting again, or using the generator to generate a new message. The agents waits before publishing the message to the chat, a duration correlated with the message length. During all of the described process, new messages can still be sent to the game’s chat. These new messages do not change the current processed context, therefore do not affect the decision or the final generated message. It is in a similar manner to human players who use the game’s chat, and might start replying to the conversation at the same time someone else adds another message.",
