Existing inference-time methods likebudget forcingrely on simplistic heuristics such as abruptly stopping, which can result in incomplete reasoning and degraded answer quality. In contrast, our method,budget guidance, steers the reasoning process toward the target budget in a smoother and more natural way, without any LLM fine-tuning.",

A lightweight predictor uses the LLM’s hidden states to predict a Gamma distribution over the remaining reasoning length for each candidate token. We then use the CDF of Gamma distribution to compute a predictor score, which is combined with the LLM’s output score to guide generation. The result is soft, token-level steering toward budget-conditioned reasoning without any LLM fine-tuning.",
