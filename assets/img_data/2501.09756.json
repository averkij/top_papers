DiLightNet[57]shows artifacts from 3D reconstruction failures central to its pipeline. Neural Gaffer[19]generates inaccurate shadow contours on relit faces since it isn’t trained on human portraits. IC-Light[59]struggles with relighting due to its choice of background as the lighting condition. Total Relighting and SwitchLight[28,22], trained on light stage data, produce soft shadows even under strong sunlight and alter skin tones. In contrast, our method achieves superior relighting while preserving subject identity.",

TheBaseconfiguration fails to reproduce the portrait’s textures and alters its identity. In contrast,Base + Multi-Taskrecovers some details, such as realistic skin tone (bottom row, yellow rectangle). TheBase + Inference Adaptationconfiguration struggles with unseen textures and accessories (e.g., the cigarette, top row, red rectangle) and produces unnatural textures for sleeveless skin (bottom row, yellow rectangle). Meanwhile,Ours + Light Stageenhances details but inherits biases from Light Stage data and cannot remove strong shadows (neck region, bottom row, red rectangle). Finally,Oursachieves plausible lighting, harmonizes well with the background, and preserves key details from the input portrait.",
