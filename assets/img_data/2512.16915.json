As shown in the legend in the upper left corner of the figure, when there are specular reflections, there will be two depths at the mirror position: the depth of the mirror surfacedSd_{S}and the depth of the object’s reflectiondRd_{R}. In the real physical world, these two points are warped separately according to their respective disentangled depths. However, depth estimation algorithms cannot predict multiple depths at the same position. Therefore, the inverse relationship between depth and disparity breaks down. This will cause Depth-Warp-Inpaint (DWI) type methods to predict results with incorrect disparity.",
