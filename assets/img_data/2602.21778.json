These queries are supervised by complementary visual features extracted from intermediate keyframes.(b) Inference:PhysicEdit follows a sequential workflow. The frozen MLLM first generates physically-grounded reasoning, which is then concatenated with the learned transition queries to serve as the condition for the diffusion backbone.",
