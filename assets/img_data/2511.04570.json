Vision-centric tasks are solved byreasoning about visual elements via drawing and imagination, including four categories: eyeballing puzzles, visual puzzles, ARC-AGI-2, and mazes. An example is shown for each. Typically, in the “ray reflection” problem from the eyeballing puzzles, Sora-2 accurately draws the light path and finds the specific point it passes through. Text-centric tasks are solved bytext-based reasoning, which are adapted from established benchmarks, and a GSM8K example is shown. The model provides a written process and the correct answer within the video.",
