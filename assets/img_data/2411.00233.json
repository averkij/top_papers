We first first resample the time signals using our anchor-based resampling technique. We then feed the resampled sample time into the sample time positional encoding layer. We further feed the time difference between two discharge cycles in hours into the cycle time difference positional encoding layer. The other signals, i.e. current, voltage and temperature are fed into the input projection. The projected signals are added to the sample time embeddings and the cycle time difference embeddings. Optionally, a CLS token can be inserted at any position. The embedded tokens are then fed into the SambaMixer Encoder. The SambaMixer Encoder consists ofMùëÄMitalic_Mstacked SambaMixer Encoder blocks.
