The two compared versions are shown: one where slides with the animation is positioned to the left of their presentation (top), and one where the animation is positioned in the presenter’s environment with InfoVids (bottom). In frames 2 and 3, the presenter binds the French army to their body to control army movements directly. This presents an engaging way to perform the chase of the French after the Russian army (Table 1Criteria 3). The background reinforces the ‘outdoors’ setting of the march and provides depth when the initial army parts into the distance in Frame 1 (Criteria 1). These design choices madeNapoleonVissignificantly more enjoyable to watch for the viewer.",

It frees the hands of the presenter and lets them walk forward to view the visualization closer within the capturing camera.
