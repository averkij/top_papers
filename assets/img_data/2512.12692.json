The workflow iteratively explores the web environment via a structured tree: it (1) initializes at the start page, (2) observes and encodes the current page state as a node in the search tree, (3) adapts action space using the current observation, and expands the node by generating candidate actions using varied contextual formulations, and these actions are validated through rule-based analysis and simple URL-existence checks; (4) evaluates actions with a reward model, (5) merges duplicate or equivalent actions, (6) updates the search tree, (7) selects the best unexecuted action using action-aware criteria, (8) restores the target state usingspeculative backtracking, (9) executes the selected action, and (10) repeats until a terminating action produces a complete solution trajectory. Theleft panelshows an example thought–action sequence produced during task execution, andtheright paneldetails the speculative backtracking mechanism. A detailed step-by-step example of the tree search is provided in Appendix (Figure8).",
