During generation, the recordedωt\\omega_{t}sequence is replayed, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction.

The squared ratio of their magnitudes (blue line) is shown to be significantly greater than the reference line across the vast majority of timesteps.

The guidance scaleω\\omegacomputed by this solution (green line) exhibits extreme fluctuations and instability.

This phenomenon confirms the solution’s “practical fragility” and strongly motivates our search for a more robust approximation.",
