We find that while CA methods achieve comparable performance on general visual-question-answering tasks, they significantly lag behind on fine-grained benchmarkssuch as chart or document understanding.Interestingly, we find this trend to be closely mirrored in the literature when comparing current state-of-the-art cross-attention- and insertion-based models, seeAppendixC.1.Based on a detailed analysis, we proposeCross-Attention viaSelf-Attention (CASA), which largely closes the gap to token insertion.",

This provides a natural gating mechanism that outperforms standard cross-attention-based VLM architectures.\nDuring training, CASA leverages recent blockwise attention mechanism to remain efficient. At inference, CASA benefits from the same practical advantages as cross-attention and can handle long interleaved image-text sequences without affecting the KV cache and memory usage of the underlying LLM.",

The attention of a query to itself is by far the strongest, consistent with the detrimental effect we found when ablating this component inTable8.\nThe average attention of the query to other text tokens is also higher than to any image tokens, further highlighting the implicit balancing of image and text tokens contributions naturally occurring in the attention operation of CASA layers.",
