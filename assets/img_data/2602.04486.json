A subset of𝒟ℛ\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathcal{R}}is injected into MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning. (2) Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization uses the remaining of𝒟ℛ\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathcal{R}}and optimizes the model with verifiable reward functions derived from the core constraints, together with the GRPO algorithm, to enhance cross-modal consistency reasoning.",
