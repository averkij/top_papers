The icons in the four corners of each image display key gameplay information, including the number of player’s current gold coins, player’s base health, and remaining enemy waves. The maps feature irregular, intersecting roads along which enemies advance toward the player’s base in successive waves. Players must strategically build different types of towers at designated locations along these roads to repel the incoming enemies. The cloud-shaped white areas represent fog of war, introducing partial observability to the environment.",

For an action involving tower construction or related operations to be considered valid, the coordinates provided must lie within one of these bounding boxes. Otherwise, the action is treated as invalid and will not be executed. In the example depicted, both Action 1 and Action 2 aim to construct a Magician Tower, the circular numbered icons indicate the specific execution locations of the two actions. Action 1 specifies a location that falls within a valid bounding box and is thus valid and executable. Action 2, however, does not intersect with any valid bounding region and is consequently invalid and ignored.",
