To optimize PhysTwin, we minimize the rendering loss and the discrepancy between simulated and observed geometry/motion. The rendering loss optimizes the Gaussian kernels, while the geometry and motion losses refine the overall geometry, topology, and physical parameters in PhysTwin.",

In contrast, the baselines fail in most cases: GS-Dynamics[69]tends to remain static, while Spring-Gauss[72]frequently causes the physical model to crash.",
