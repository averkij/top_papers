The first focuses on studying the‚ûäpersonalized text generateddirectly, while the second emphasizes using personalized information as intermediate steps or implicitly as embeddings to improve the quality of a‚ûãdownstream tasksuch as recommendation systems.\nSee Section2for a detailed discussion.",
