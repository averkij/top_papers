On the other hand, Autoregressive sampling diverges due to collisions with the generated scene, is not faithful to the conditioning trajectory, and demonstrates poor loop closure even when augmented with RAG.",

We first partition the target video into non-overlapping chunks shorter than the model’s context window, then denoise everytarget chunkjointlywith itsneighboringchunksto condition on both the pastand future. We use the denoised target chunk of every context window to update the noisy stitched sequence while discarding the denoised past and future conditioning chunks. We further enable Omni Guidance (Sec.3.4), which enhances temporal consistency, by replacing the original score functionϵθ\\epsilon_{\\theta}with the guided score functionϵ~θ\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{\\theta}in Eq.8.",

As a result, target chunks are conditioned on all relevant neighbors across the entire stitching process. See Fig.8for the full set of spatial windows.",

GVS, on the other hand, avoids collisions, generates the desiredstaircase, andclosesloops, all the while maintaining temporal consistency.",
