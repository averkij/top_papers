The knowledge system of our bench is structured into six fine-grained levels: discipline, grade, curriculum, topic, meta-knowledge, and key knowledge points, where the three rings showcase the first three levels. Examples illustrate the representative grades (elementary, middle, and high schools), difficulty levels (easy, medium, and high), questions and answers, and key knowledge points of each discipline. The diverse question forms (single- and multiple-choice, open-ended question, fill-in-blank, true-or-false) and detailed answer explanations are also demonstrated.",

The knowledge in our benchmark is structured into six interconnected levels: Level 1 - discipline, Level 2 - grade, Level 3 - curriculum, Level 4 - topics, Level 5 - meta-knowledge, and Level 6 - key knowledge point. Statistics of knowledge coverage of our bench is illustrated in terms of the number of instance occurrences at (b) discipline and grade levels; (c) high-school curriculum level; and (d) elementary- and middle-school curriculum level. Examples of curriculum-level knowledge points are also demonstrated.",
