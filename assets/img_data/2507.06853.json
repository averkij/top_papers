The Diffusion Molecule Transformer (DMT) is used as the denoising network, and spectra encoded by SpecFormer serve as conditional input.\n(B) Architecture of the DMT, which processes node features, edge features, and atomic coordinates through three parallel streams with shared condition encoding, relational multi-head attention, and equivariant updates.\n(C) Architecture and pre-training strategy of SpecFormer, which encodes multi-modal spectra (UV-Vis, IR, and Raman) through a unified transformer encoder. It is pre-trained via masked patch reconstruction (MPR) and contrastive learning with 3D molecular structures.",
