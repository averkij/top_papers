Phase II creates containerized environments and validates them with self written prerequisite tests. Phase III generates completion tests that verify the expected end state. Phase IV filters tasks by sampling 16 solutions from o3, retaining only tasks where at least one solution succeeds. Some example tasks include shell configuration, log analysis, and checksum generation.",
