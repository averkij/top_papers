(a) As signals pass through linear and nonlinear transformations, this causes spectral leakage and distortion, mixing multiple frequencies into a single dimension. Under RoPE, each dimension is treated as a single-frequency component. By contrast, FoPE models each dimension as a Fourier series of different frequency components, thereby separating information more effectively and mitigating spectral damage. (b) FoPE eliminates inadequately trained frequency components, which are harmful for periodic extension. By preserving only the zero-frequency component, FoPE safeguards periodic extension and delivers more robust length generalization.",
