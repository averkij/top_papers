Given a coding task, the LLM policy generates a candidate program, which is then evaluated along two automated axes: (1) Vulnerability Detector applies program analysis to flag security and maintainability defects, (2) Functionality Verifier runs unit tests to assess correctness. The two reward signals are averaged and fed into a policy-gradient update, steering the LLM toward high-quality, functionally correct code with minimal human effort.",

Initially, the model produces incorrect and insecure code, misinterpreting \"or\" asANDand directly incorporating unsanitized user inputs. Later on, it adopts parameterized execution (using?placeholders in the query with separate parameter binding) to implicitly address vulnerabilities. Finally, it corrects the query logic and explicitly sanitizes user inputs with proper type conversion (usingfloat(⋅⋅\\cdot⋅)to enforce correct type conversion of the input).",
