In A2D, we first train a decomposerπθD\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{D}}}through RLVR, guided by the format rewardRFR_{\\text{F}}and quality rewardRQR_{\\text{Q}}. Next, we use this decomposer to annotate sub-questions for each question in the training dataset, and design the in-context distillation loss (IDL),i.e.,Eq.5, to integrate the sub-question guidance into the RLVR process for reasonerπθR\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{R}}}. To better demonstrate the pipeline of our A2D, we present the pseudo code in Algorithm1.",
