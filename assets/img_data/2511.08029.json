                "caption": "Figure 1:Our four-stage data generation and training pipeline.Stage 1:A query is synthetically generated from a positive document’s abstract using a T5 model.Stage 2:A 2-hop citation neighborhood is constructed by retrieving papers cited by the positive document (1-hop) and papers cited by them (2-hop) via the PubMed API.Stage 3:Hard negatives are mined via semantic graph traversal. First, similarities are computed between the query and 1-hop documents. Second, a dense, pairwise similarity graph is built for all 1-hop and 2-hop documents. Third, a 5-step greedy traversal is initiated from the 1-hop document most similar to the query, creating a path of five hard negatives.Stage 4:The resulting (Query, Positive Document, Hard Negatives) triplet is used to fine-tune the GTE model using the multiple negative ranking loss.",
