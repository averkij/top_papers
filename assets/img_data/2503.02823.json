The Taste & Affect Music Database is modified and used to fine-tune MusicGEN, resulting in a Fine-tuned MusicGEN model. Both the base and fine-tuned models generate music using taste-based prompts. The generated stimuli are then evaluated through two experimental tasks: (A) a comparison between baseline and fine-tuned models, and (B) a semantic differential analysis of the fine-tuned stimuli.",
