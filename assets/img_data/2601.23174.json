Frame-level representations extracted by a frozen, self-supervised encoder are compressed and dynamically grouped into variable-length chunks, pooled, and quantized into discrete tokens. The decoding stage reverses this process by expanding token-level representations back to frame-level features before waveform reconstruction. Character-level boundaries are provided during training by a frozen aligner.",
