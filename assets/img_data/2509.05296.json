                "caption": "Figure 1:Overview.Given an image stream, our method WinT3R processes input images in a sliding-window manner, where adjacent windows overlap by half of the window size. Unlike previous online reconstruction methods, our model generates extremely compact camera tokens during online reconstruction to serve as global information for historical frames. This enables the reconstructions of subsequent windows to leverage these global cues for more accurate results. Our model achieves high-quality geometry reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance at 17 FPS.",

                "caption": "Figure 2:WinT3R pipeline. We detail the reconstruction process within a single window. All images are first passed through a frame-wise ViT encoder, which outputs image tokens. Camera tokens are then appended to these tokens. Then the tokens within this window are collectively fed into a decoder to interact with state tokens. Finally, the image tokens output by the decoder are sent to a lightweight convolutional head to predict local point maps. Meanwhile, the camera tokens, along with those in the camera token pool, are jointly fed into a camera head to predict camera parameters, while these camera tokens are simultaneously added to the camera token pool.",
