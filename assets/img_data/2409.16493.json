NoTeeline retrieves the transcript at the timestamp (b). In addition, NoTeeline references a small collection of the user’s previous notes (c). Given (b) and (c), NoTeeline automatically expands the micronote into a complete note in their writing style (1). Inspired by the Cornell notetaking system(Saran et al.,2022), NoTeeline generates review questions (2), a brief summary (3), and groups notes into key themes (4) to assist users in note review.",
