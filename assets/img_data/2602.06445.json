The reward critic is trained with privileged observations. The simulator provides the reward, energy cost, and symmetry cost, which are used to compute the reward and cost returns. The policy is then updated using the Lagrangian formulation inEq.˜20to balance rewards and costs. The trained policy is directly deployed to the real world.",
