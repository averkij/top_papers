This parallax is confined to the region between the epipole𝐞′\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime}and𝐱∞\\mathbf{x}_{\\infty}, as visualized by the yellow segment on the epipolar linel′l^{\\prime}.\nThis spatial constraint helps the model to achieve\nhigher camera pose fidelity with reduced search space.\nEnd-to-end training enables the network to implicitly refine the 3D geometry, correcting inaccuracies in𝐗\\mathbf{X}.\n(b)Reprojection-based approach.Inaccuracies in depth estimation lead to unreliable conditions, causing artifacts in the generated image. Since no gradients flow through the depth estimation network, the incorrect reprojection position𝐱′\\mathbf{x^{\\prime}}remains fixed during training, hindering error correction.",

ReCamMaster further fails to reflect pose changes in the initial frame even when trajectory interpolation is applied (ReCamMasterw/ Interp). TrajectoryCrafter introduces artifacts due to inaccurate reprojection (highlighted in the orange box). In contrast, our method achieves natural pose transitions while maintaining high visual quality throughout the sequence. Best viewed in zoom.",
