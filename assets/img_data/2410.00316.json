While existing TTS and voice cloning frameworks lack the option for users to control emotions in speech, our framework allows users to embed arbitrary emotion with a specified intensity in speech with few-shot samples. This framework allows us to propose two methods for controlling emotions based on open-ended text descriptions of emotions.",
