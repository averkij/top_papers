Given an input 3D mesh, e.g., designed using simple 3D primitives, it transfers the texture and fine geometric details of an appearance object (e.g., the rounded edges of the table on the top left and the base and mattress distinction of the bed on the top right) but preserves the geometric form of the input mesh. Its flexibility across appearance modalities like meshes or text makes GuideFlow3D efficient for generating diverse 3D assets.",

EasiTex[52]generates non-smooth repetitions of texture and fails to generate textures for the entire object (e.g., the handles of the chair or the bottom part of the bunk bed). Cross Image Attention[2]performs better but omits texture details (cabinet‚Äôs wood texture) and fails to preserve good local geometry. Trellis[72]preserves better the texture of the appearance object and does better on matching it to the input object, however, it fails at providing a uniform texture on the arms of the chair and does not preserve the overall geometry of the bunk bed by closing the side hole.
