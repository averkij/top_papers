At each timestep, candidate single-position mutations with ReDi-predicted probabilities (visualized by arrows of varying thickness) are evaluated by multiple objective functions. A locally balanced proposal is then constructed using Tchebycheff scalarization with annealed guidance strength, and the next state is selected via a Metropolis-Hastings update. This iterative process drives the generated sequences toward the Pareto front.",
