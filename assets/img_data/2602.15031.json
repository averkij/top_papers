To maintain real-time performance, our inference pipeline dynamically allocates compute proportional to the edit mask size (Middle). EditCtrl also intelligently propagates object edits from initial frames into the future (after the orange line), ensuring high temporal and object consistency in the resulting edit (Bottom).",

Foreground content is masked out, giving the background video that is also down-sampled to a constant resolution regardless of the original resolution. The compact global context of the down-sampled background video and the local context at the mask edit region are then encoded. These are given to trainable local and global adapters inside a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model thatdenoises tokens𝐳t\\mathbf{z}^{t}only in the masked edit regiongiven a text prompt. After diffusion, the tokens are scattered into the masked edit region in the encoded source video latents. Our method shows a proportional speedup with respect to the target mask area ratio.",
