(a) Starting from an SfM-derived point cloud, we generate a set of seed points through voxelization, establishing a stable foundation for guiding the distribution and density of 2D Gaussians. We further introduce an adaptive growth and pruning strategy to optimize seed points. (b) We incorporate depth and normal priors, addressing the challenges of detailed areas and textureless regions. (c) We introduce multi-view consistency constraints to further enhance the quality of the indoor scene reconstruction.",
