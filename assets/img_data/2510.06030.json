Red dots denote systems where only OTGPD succeeded, blue dots where only the alternate method succeeded, and orange dots where both failed. (C) Bar chart summarizing success rate of each method for initial structures that represent a single fragment and those representing two fragments. The single-fragment cases represent typical saddle point searches, while the two-fragment cases test performance on more complex, often arbitrary dissociation pathways. The OTGPD method demonstrates a clear advantage. In addition to a mutual success rate exceeding 93% in both comparisons, OTGPD uniquely finds the saddle point for an additional 11 systems (4.6%) compared to GPDimer (1.3%) and additional 9 systems (3.8%) compared to Dimer (1.7%).",

(A) A performance profile graph comparing the wall-clock time needed to reach the saddle point. The vertical axis shows the proportion of problems solved within a performance ratiorrof the best time recorded for that system. A curve that is higher and further to the left indicates superior performance. The OTGPD method (teal) solves 70.6% of problems with the best time (rr=1), reflected in its median performance ratio of 1.00. This significantly outperforms both GPDimer (win rate 20.6%, medianrr=1.39) and the standard dimer method (win rate 8.8%, medianrr=2.65). (B) Violin and box plots showing the distribution of the number of HF calculations for the successful runs of each method (populations detailed in Figure3). Over these valid systems, both GP-accelerated methods reduce the median number of HF calculations by an order of magnitude from 254 for the standard dimer method to 30 for GPDimer and 28 for OTGPD. These gains in data efficiency directly lead to the superior wall-time performance seen in (A), with OTGPD’s mean time to solution (12.6 min) reducing the wall time by nearly a half compared to the standard Dimer (23.7 min) and to less than a half compared to GPDimer (28.3 min).",
