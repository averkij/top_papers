Measures marked * involve optimized linear transforms, whereas others are computed zero-shot; shading indicates 95% confidence intervals. The Dutchw2v2-nlmodel achieves highest scores across most analyses of Dutch phone and word encoding, though the size of this language-specific advantage varies considerably across analyses.",
