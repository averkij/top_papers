On the left, the inner ring illustrates three primary behavior categories—Bias,Harmful Generation, andHallucination—with their respective dataset sizes. The middle ring breaks each category down into constituent datasets proportional to their size, while the third ring (outermost) visualizes finer-grained subcategories such as demographic dimensions (forBias), harmful content types (forHarmful Generation), and hallucination difficulty levels (forHallucination). Secondary behavior datasets, each with fewer than 1k prompts, are categorized and displayed on the right.",
