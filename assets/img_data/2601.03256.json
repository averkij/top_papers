In Stage II, this skeleton guides part assembly in a structured latent space (SLAT), yielding a composed latent code𝐙′\\mathbf{Z}^{\\prime}. In Stage III,𝐙′\\mathbf{Z}^{\\prime}is decoded into a coarse 3D creature𝐗′\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}, which guides geometry-invariant texture editing and undergoes a final style-conscious refinement to produce the detailed, harmonious output𝐗′′\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime\\prime}. The entire pipeline is automatic, training-free, and feed-forward.",

The assets without LLM-guided design contain regions of improper scale, unreasonable orientation or position. The skinning weight and geometry/texture interpolation guarantee suitable composed results without holes or artifacts. Without geometrically-invariant texture editing, the final appearance patterns fail to correspond to the semantic regions, producing artifacts or unreasonable texture.\nWithout style-consistent generation, the coarse 3D creature contains disharmonious contents from source assets. In contrast, our full method produces high-fidelity fantastic 3D creatures, and the appearance can be flexibly edited.",
