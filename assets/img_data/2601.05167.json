During generation, it can actively trigger an “intervention” by generating a<call>command. The Large Language Model then generates the specified number of tokens, after which control returns to the SLM to complete the reasoning.(Right) Difficulty-Aware Reward Design:During GRPO training, we sample a group of rollouts (both with and without LLM intervention) and classify the query difficulty into three distinct scenarios:Solvable,Teacher-Dependent, andUnsolvable, to guide the policy optimization.Distinct reward designs are applied to each scenario to align the model’s behavior with the optimal strategy.",
