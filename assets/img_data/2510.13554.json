                "caption": "Figure 1:Attention dynamics uncover reasoning patterns:Local heads exhibit a near-diagonal, sawtooth pattern that forms phrasal chunks, while global heads highlight tokens with strong downstream influence. Their coupling reveals a preplan-and-anchor rhythm: at chunk onsets, preplan tokens set up the next reasoning step, followed (or coinciding) by anchor tokens that are persistently revisited by future tokens to guide downstream reasoning.Reasoning rhythm enhances RL:Leveraging detected preplan and anchor tokens, our RL method amplifies their token-level credit accordingly, focusing learning on the critical nodes that drive more effective reasoning.",

Perturbing a high-FAI position typically leads to a clear shift in the overall reasoning logic, whereas replacing a low-FAI token more frequently just alters local phrasing, leaving the downstream reasoning trajectory essentially unchanged.",
