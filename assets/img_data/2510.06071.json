Recall is also low for the outlier identificationtask (bottom), although Flash, when few-shot prompted, seems promising (65.01%). Lowering the IoU to 0.5 considerably changes the results for some models, but Recall remains low (o3, when few-shot prompted, reaches a Recall of 50.26%). Doubling the distance threshold to 20px does not change the conclusions.",
