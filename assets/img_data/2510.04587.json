                "caption": "Figure 1:TheAI Session Recorderframework for converting expert viewing behavior into agent-ready training data.aThe AI Session Recorder addresses the core data challenge: raw, continuous user logs are too noisy and complex for AI to learn from. The recorder’s algorithm transforms this chaotic data stream into discrete, meaningful commands (e.g., ‘5x-Inspect’), inspired by the discrete objective lenses (e.g., 5x, 10x, 40x) on physical microscopes.bThe recorder’s novel data generation pipeline creates the Pathology-CoT dataset. For each captured action, an AI drafts a rationale explaining the expert’s focus, which a pathologist then efficiently verifies or corrects in a human-in-the-loop workflow.cThe resulting dataset contains 5,222 conversational rounds from pathologists with diverse experience levels.dThe semi-automated, human-in-the-loop workflow is highly efficient, reducing labeling time by approximately six-fold compared to manual annotation from scratch.",
