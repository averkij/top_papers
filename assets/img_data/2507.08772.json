Mutual guidance (a) is introduced to facilitate information exchange between the 3D and 2D modalities (via Cross-Modality Attention) as well as between different parts (via Cross-Part Attention). Additionally, (b) the 3D bounding boxes are treated as cube meshes, and the extracted box tokens are injected into the 3D denoiser through cross-attention. Simultaneously, the boxes are rendered into 2D images and injected into the 2D denoiser via ControlNet.",
