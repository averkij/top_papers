The figure shows examples of well-segmented cases (left) and challenging cases (right).  Each example consists of six columns: the first two are from ISIC 2016, the middle two from ISIC 2017, and the last two from ISIC 2018.  Within each column, the first row shows the original image, the second row the ground truth segmentation mask, and the third row the predicted segmentation mask. The fourth row visualizes the segmentation on the original image, with the ground truth contour in green and the predicted mask contour in blue.",
