For each region, the ground-truth mask is tokenized into two discrete codes, and SAMTok reconstructs the mask solely from the original image and the quantized mask tokens.

Since SAMTok is fully decoupled from the MLLM, its reconstruction quality remains stable regardless of downstream model training—unlike joint-training mask tokenizers that tend to collapse to elliptical or blurred masks.",
