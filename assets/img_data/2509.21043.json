Idea generation is done fully in-weights, not in-context, since CC involves recalling facts in-memory.",

Novelty is normalized by the mean novelty of simple, single-hop paths at each constraint level to isolate the effect of complexity. A clear downward trend is visible across all scales, indicating that as more utility constraints are imposed, the novelty of the generated artifacts tends to decrease.",
