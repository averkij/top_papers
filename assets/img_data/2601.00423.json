We also report the variance of clip score for generated images. Samples from the initial steps and merged steps share higher differences, while posterior steps generate undistinguishable samples, whose variance is similar to small perturbation on original images. (b) We report the entropy of SDE sampling on each timestep with different merged steps. More merged steps indicate higher entropy and larger exploration scope in RL training. (c) We visualize the training reward curves on models trained on all timesteps, the first half timesteps, and the second half timesteps.",
