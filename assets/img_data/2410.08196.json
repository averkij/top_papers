We first use a fastText classifier to filter the Common Crawl corpus, resulting in the initial filtered math texts. Then, we annotate part of the filtered texts to train a new fastText classifier, and conduct a second filtering, resulting in the finer filtered math texts. Then we use an instruction-tuned LLM to extract reasoning steps from these math-related texts, and translate the reasoning steps into corresponding code snippets. We execute the code snippets and compare the output with the expected result. If the code executes successfully and the result is as expected, the code is retained.",
