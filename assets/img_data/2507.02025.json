Controllable modeling is achieved by inserting a modular Adaptor into this trunk. A Diffusion Block then iteratively generates structure samples, which are ranked by a Confidence Head (pLDDT, pTM) to yield the final prediction. The bottom panel shows how adapters enable specialized downstream tasks like Guided Folding, Target-Specific Modeling, and Affinity Prediction.",
