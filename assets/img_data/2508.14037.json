First, a standard teacher modelGs​t​dG_{std}is trained, along with two variants:Gp​e​r​bG_{perb}with random perturbation andGd​r​o​pG_{drop}with random dropout. Then, a pruned student modelGs​t​dG_{std}is supervised by the outputs of these teachers. Additionally, a spatial distribution distillation strategy is introduced to help the student learn structural patterns from the teachers.",
