To equip ReaRAG with knowledge-guided reasoning ability, we propose an automated data construction approach (Algorithm1). Next, we fine-tune ReaRAG on the constructed dataset to conduct reasoning iteratively, following the Thought-Action-Observation Paradigm to solve complex queries. Pseudocode for the inference stage is provided in Algorithm2.",
