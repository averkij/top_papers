We plot the rank of the target suffix tokens over each successive token that is decoded by greedy and top-k𝑘kitalic_ksampling. At every index except one, the tokens in the target sequence have rank 1. At index 15, the target token has rank 2, which means greedy sampling does not select this token, and after which the generated sequence diverges from the target. If, at index 15, the second most likely token had been selected instead, then the remaining positions all have the target token as the top ranked token, so a probabilistic sampling scheme like top-k𝑘kitalic_ksampling has a high likelihood of generating the target suffix. See Figure11(a)in AppendixEfor the specific generated and target text for this example.",
