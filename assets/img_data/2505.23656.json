We apply Token Relation Distillation (TRD) loss to align pairwise token similarities between video SSL representations and intermediate features in diffusion transformer blocks. Within each representation, tokens form spatial relations with other tokens in the same latent frame and temporal relations with tokens in other latent frames.",
