The pipeline consists of three stages: (1)Pre-processing: Raw HTML is transformed into two parallel representations—Simplified HTML(streamlined input for the model with reduced tokens) andMapping HTML(preserving original structure for faithful reconstruction). (2)Content Classification: MinerU-HTML-Classifier (0.6B parameter LM) performs sequential block classification on the simplified input, with a custom logits processor implementing constrained decoding to ensure structured JSON output without hallucination. (3)Post-processing: Predicted labels (\"main\" or \"other\") are used to select corresponding blocks from the Mapping HTML, yielding the finalMain-HTMLas a valid DOM subtree of the original document.",

MinerU-HTML follows a virtuous cycle: the model-based extractor can be systematically improved by collecting more training data (including failure cases), retraining on expanded datasets, and leveraging advances in base model capabilities. This makes MinerU-HTML’s approach inherently more scalable and future-proof as language models continue to advance.",
