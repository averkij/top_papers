The pipeline includes three main stages: (1) anOutline Proposalmodule that structures the article outline based on the multimodal topic input (image and text); (2) aTextual Article Writingmodule involving persona generation, multi-agent collaborative exploration, and article drafting; and (3) aMultimodal Article Writingmodule that incorporates relevant images through positioning proposals, retrieval, selection, and final polishing. The entire generation process is enhanced by aMulti-Perspective Self-Reflectionmodule, leveraging supervisory and agent-specific feedback (writer, reader, editor) to iteratively improve article quality in terms of coherence, readability and engagement, etc",
