A query is first fed into Open Reasoning Agent which orchestrates the available set of tools to interpret and answer the query. The most important tool is the Open Search Tool that we design, which provides a high quality context from multiple retrieved sources from the web. In our experiments we use Llama3.1-70B and DeepSeek-R1 as our base model.",
