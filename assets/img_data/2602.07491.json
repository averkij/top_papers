The system begins with user input, which the Planner decomposes into sub-questions focusing on design parameters like material properties, operational conditions, failure modes, and interface requirements. The Hybrid GraphWeave agent retrieves evidence to answer each sub-question, from which the Evaluator selects pertinent design keywords with associated metrics. The Creative GraphWeave agent explores graph traversal pathways using the Evaluator keywords as stopping points to uncover novel connections and ideas. These are then synthesized by an Engineer into hypotheses that integrate both creative insights and contextual evidence. Bottom arrows illustrate how agents selectively retrieve and incorporate earlier responses as context for their own reasoning.",

The Hybrid GraphWeave agent weaves evidence from two sources: the raw PFAS text corpus and the PFAS-Specific Knowledge Graph. It embeds the user query, retrieves the top matching text chunks from the corpus, and links them to corresponding subgraphs in the knowledge graph, thereby providing both textual evidence and relational context. In contrast, the Creative GraphWeave agent focuses on discovering new ideas by exploring and weaving connections between keywords within the knowledge graph. It identifies relevant nodes and applies pathfinding algorithms to assemble subgraphs that highlight potential connections. Together, the two agents provide complementary capabilities: Hybrid GraphWeave ensures evidence-grounded retrieval, while Creative GraphWeave enables exploratory ideation.",
