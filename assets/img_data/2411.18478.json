We illustrate the learning process through a teacher-student paradigm. (a) Direct Prompting (Zero-shot CoT) provides only generic “Let’s think step by step” instruction, proving insufficient for executing step-by-step reasoning; (b) In-Context Learning (Few-shot CoT) offers carefully selected examples but fails to generalize when encountering dissimilar problems; (c) Our Method (HiAR-ICL) teaches high-level thought patterns, enabling robust performance on various problems.",
