It combines a 7B-parameter VLA model trained on an extensive open-source dataset of cognitive tasks—including reasoning, human recognition, and symbol understanding—with a 7B-parameter VLM reasoning module that refines task directives. The system is evaluated within CognitiveDroneBench—the first evaluation benchmark for VLA systems tailored to cognitive UAVs—where the drone must navigate a track with gates by selecting the appropriate gate through solving cognitive tasks. We have released the complete dataset, benchmark environment, model weights, and training/inference code as open source.",
