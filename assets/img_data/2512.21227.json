                "caption": "Figure 1:Systematic Evaluation of Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation Models.(a) Workflow of this study. Eight generative models (CrystaLLM, MatterGen, DiffCSP, InvDesFlow-AL, CrystalFlow, CrystalFormer, etc.) were used to generate a total of 221,000 novel structures. After removing duplicates and post-processing for CIF validity, full phonon-spectrum calculations were performed using MatterSim combined with Phonopy on 108,843 successfully relaxed crystals. In total, 28,119 structures were found to be dynamically stable, corresponding to an overall stability ratio of 25.83%.\n(b) Based on the systematic phonon-spectrum evaluation of over 10,000 materials by Miguel A. L. Marques et al., we employed MatterSim-v1—which attains DFT-level accuracy with an average error smaller than the difference between PBE and PBEsol functionals—as the unified potential for all subsequent phonon calculations, ensuring consistency in evaluation standards.\n(c) Key results and model performance comparison. All generated models face challenges in achieving dynamical stability. The top three models are MatterGen (41.0%), InvDesFlow-AL (38.4%), and CrystalFormer (34.4%), all of which benefited from pretraining on large, stable datasets such as Alex20. In contrast, models trained on smaller datasets such as MP20—e.g., CrystalFlow (16.7%)—show significantly lower performance. The LLM-based CrystaLLM (3.0%) performs the worst, highlighting its current disadvantage relative to architectures such as graph neural networks for this task.",

They underscore the importance of incorporating explicit stability constraints or performing posterior stability screening within the generation pipeline.",

Each element is colored according to its occurrence frequency in the stable crystal set, with darker colors indicating higher frequencies. The analysis shows that oxygen (O) is the most prevalent element (10,272 occurrences), followed by lithium (Li, 5,792) and fluorine (F, 5,236), whereas noble gas elements appear only rarely. This distribution clearly indicates that current generative models tend to predict stable compounds containing chemically active elements, in good agreement with established chemical intuition.",
