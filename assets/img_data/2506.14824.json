The server hosts the frozen LLM, while each client performs local tuning viaNanoEdge, which includesNanoAdapter-T for text andNanoAdapter-I for vision. Clients upload low-rank adapter updates, which are aggregated on the server using Fisher merging. This design reduces client overhead and supports scalable, multimodal federated learning under data heterogeneity.",
