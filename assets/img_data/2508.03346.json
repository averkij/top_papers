This plot illustrates the impact of different pruning strategies (Random, High-Entropy Steps, Low-Entropy Steps) on final answer accuracy as the mask ratio of intermediate COT steps increases. Note that masking up to80% of low-entropy stepsmaintains complete COT accuracy (74%), while high-entropy and random masking lead to significant performance degradation. (b) Accuracy vs. Tokens Usage Ratio on Other Benchmarks. This plot compares the accuracy and token usage ratio of the Full COT against our Compressed COT (80% low-entropy steps pruning) across Math500, AIME 2024, and AIME 2025 datasets of DeepSeek-R1-7B.",
