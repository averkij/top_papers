In Grounding mode, OS-Atlas predicts element coordinates based on user instructions and can be integrated with a planner module to create a complete agent. In Action mode, OS-Atlas functions independently to solve step-level agent tasks universally across different platforms and applications, even in zero-shot OOD scenarios. In Agent mode, OS-Atlas undergoes further supervised fine-tuning to address specific agent tasks.\n(Right) Overall performance comparisons between OS-Atlas and other state-of-the-art models.",
