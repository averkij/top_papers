Leading models (GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, LLaVA-NeXT and Cambrian) lag behind human performance by at least-56%on average across four types of spatial relations (height, location, orientation, and multi-object). All models struggle with questions involving 3D orientation (e.g., “on the left”) and complex spatial reasoning (e.g., “viewpoint towards object”). SeeFig.2(a)for examples.",
