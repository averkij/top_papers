In contrast, SPO’s rate of near-zero advantages (red/green lines) increases as its value tracker learns, indicating successful learning, not wasted computation.(b)Comparison of unnormalized advantage variance. SPO’s baseline (red) provides a stable, low-variance signal, significantly reducing the variance of the raw reward (denoted as “SPO No Baseline” as green). GRPO’s effective advantage (blue), calculated only on its non-degenerate samples, is highly volatile, even more so than the raw reward variance (green line, labeled “SPO No Baseline”), revealing the instability of its on-the-fly approach.",
