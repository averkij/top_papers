The results are averaged across 7 long Russian audios, and the results for individual audios are shown in semi-transparent. Whisper scores method is show as a line for different score threshold. All model disagreement and ensembling methods cannot reliably outperform Whisper scores as a source of uncertainty. It can be seen that if we mark only around 5% words as uncertain, we can accumulate in them 35% of all errors (excluding errors caused by missed words in transcription).",
