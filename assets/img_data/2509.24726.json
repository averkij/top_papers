Here, theTeacher—a powerful LLM—guides the co-evolution of two agents. TheSolverimproves by generating solutions and refining them through the Teacher’s feedback, while theGeneratorevolves by strategically distilling the Teacher’s behavior to produce an increasingly suitable curriculum for the Solver.",

(a) Solver Evolving: The Solver attempts to solve problems and learns from preference pairs of correct and incorrect solutions via DPO, while the frozen Teacher strategically generates challenging problems based on Solver failures using fixed generation and evaluation functions. (b) Generator Evolving: The Generator distills the Teacher’s problem generation strategy using value-weighted supervised learning. Together, these create a self-improving loop where the curriculum dynamically evolves to maintain optimal challenge levels for the Solver’s current capabilities.",
