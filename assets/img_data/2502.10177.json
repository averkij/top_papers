This approach lacks structured spatio-temporal reasoning, limiting its adaptability in complex, long-horizon tasks.(b) STMAutilizes dedicated spatial memory and temporal memory, summarized into refined spatial belief and temporal belief using the large model’s capabilities. The planner-critic module enables closed-loop planning, dynamically validating and adjusting action sequences based on environmental feedback.",

                "caption": "Figure 2:Overview of STMA.STMA consists of two components: a spatio-temporal memory module and a planner-critic module. The spatio-temporal memory module is divided into a temporal memory submodule and a spatial memory submodule, which provide temporal and spatial beliefs, respectively. These beliefs serve as the spatio-temporal context for the planner-critic module. The planner-critic module consists of a planner and a critic. The planner performs action planning based on the belief and generates multi-step plans in a single pass. The critic evaluates the plan before each action step, verifying whether the plan is correct and aligns with the most current environmental conditions.",

Based on the agent’s executed actions, the environment returns feedback. These pieces of information are recorded in STMA’s spatio-temporal memory, serving as the necessary context for the planner-critic agent. Within this framework, the planner and critic collaborate to generate action plans and interact with the environment.",
