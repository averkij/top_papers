The random replacement baseline exhibits significant deviation from the MDA replacement, exceeding three standard errors (3σ\\sigma).

After step 2000, the score begins to exhibit small-scale fluctuations. We believe that the induction circuit has already been formed at this stage, and subsequent changes involve other trade-offs. Therefore, this regime is not further considered in the present study. This also accounts for the slight decline observed in the the latter part of the curve inFigure2.",
