As the origin of Fauvism, this work achieved significant artistic value by intentionally breaking the prevailing aesthetic norms of its time through anti-naturalistic color. However, despite explicit instructions for Fauvism, this image still received low HPSv3 score of 1.73[ma_hpsv3_2025]because it does not align with mainstream notions of “good” aesthetics. In contrast, typical high-aesthetic images reach scores around 15.",

When both images are evaluated by a reward modelrr(HPSv3 in these examples)using the wide-spectrum aesthetics prompt, the model assigns higher scores to the left images, as they align more closely with general aesthetic preferences, despite the right images better matching the user’s intended output.",

We test the image generation models’ adherence to user-specified input by prompting them to create wide-spectrum aesthetics imagery, a domain important for critical and experimental art. The core inquiry is whether the model remains faithful to the prompt or defaults to a high-quality and universally good aesthetic output.",
