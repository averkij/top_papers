                "caption": "Figure 1:Architecture of SQL-of-Thought. The process begins as the user asks a natural language question. The relevant schema is fetched from the database, and sent alongwith the question to Schema Linking agent, which extracts the useful tables and columns needed to solve the question. This cropped schema and the question is sent to the Subproblem agent, which divides the problem into smaller, clause-wise subproblems. Then the Query Plan Agent is invoked, using Chain of Thought to procedurally generate an executable Query Plan. This query plan is used by the SQL Agent to generate a valid SQL solution, which is then executed on the DB Execution engine. If the execution fails, the correction loop is invoked, with the execution error, error taxonomy, and incorrect SQL sent to the Correction Plan Agent, to investigate the error and generate a Correction Plan using a CoT-guided rectification mechanism to fix it. The Correction SQL Agent uses this plan to generate the correct SQL query. The Guided Correction Loop is invoked until the query is successful or maximum attempts are finished.",
