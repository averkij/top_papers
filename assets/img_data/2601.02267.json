The figure illustrates our complete pipeline from multi-view images to final mesh recovery, which proceeds as follows: (a) given multi-view images and cameras parameters, the proxy generator produces per-view SMPL-X proxies𝐏v\\mathbf{P}_{v}; (b) hand-focused regions inferred from the body proxies are incorporated as additional views for hand refinement; (c) test-time scaling runsKKstochastic inference attempts, aggregates predictions through median (UV) and majority voting (segmentation), and computes pixel-wise uncertainty to produce a weight map𝐖v\\mathbf{W}_{v}that guides fitting; (d) the body is fitted and then refined with hand-specific proxies to recover the final human mesh.",
