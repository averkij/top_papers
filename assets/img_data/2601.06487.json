                "caption": "Figure 1:(a) Illustration of discriminative collapse in pointwise evaluation:We analyse the rewards of trajectory groups generated for a query example during RL training through two evaluation settings. First, the intra-group reward signal represents the pointwise rewards assigned to each trajectory within the group during a single-round evaluation. And the intra-group variance, denoted asﾏトroup\\sigma_{\\text{group}}, quantifies the degree of variation among different trajectories. Secondly, the N-round noise statistic present the average reward and corresponding scoring noise band for each trajectory across N independent evaluation repetitions, from which the noise varianceﾏハoise\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}is estimated. Observations reveal that the evaluation noise varianceﾏハoise\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}is substantial, comparable to the intra-group varianceﾏトroup\\sigma_{\\text{group}}. This results in an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), causing genuine advantages to be obscured by noise and hindering effective reinforcement learning optimization.(b) ArenaRL Performance:By shifting from pointwise scalar scoring to tournament-based relative ranking, ArenaRL significantly outperforms baselines (SFT, GRPO, GSPO) across diverse open-ended benchmarks.",
