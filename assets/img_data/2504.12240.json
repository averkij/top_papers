The framework effectively manages an arbitrary number of contextual image references through localized reusable positional encoding, ensuring appropriate aspect ratios and resolutions. Additionally, the causal sparse DiT architecture processes long contextual references, enhancing identity preservation and color accuracy while reducing computational complexity. The integration of optional color hints further ensures user flexibility, culminating in high-quality coloring that is highly suitable for industrial applications.",
