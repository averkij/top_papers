A strong previously post-trained model is used to judge generation candidates at each RL step for quality, safety and hallucination, where the candidates are: (i)NNrollouts from the current policy; (ii) the original suffix; and (iii) a rewrite of the suffix by the strong post-trained model. The rewrite can improve the pretrain data’s quality or safety; in the latter case as the prefix remains unsafe the model is always learning how to steer away to a safe suffix. At the start of training model rollouts(i)are low quality, so training relies on candidates(ii)and(iii); later in training the judge starts rewarding winning rollouts.",

Our objective is to produce safe rewrites that remain similar to the original suffix. Token overlap serves as a measure of this similarity. For safe suffixes, token overlap increases and approaches 1.0 as we optimize for exact matches. In contrast, token overlap for unsafe suffixes averages around 0.63 and remains close to its initial value, indicating less change (should not overlap).",
