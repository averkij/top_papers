(a) Existing methods prematurely integrate ID and text modalities into the LLM, leading to limited utilization of multimodal content features. (b) Our approach first processes text and non-text modalities through the LLM to generate rich multimodal representations and then incorporates ID information via post-alignment, ensuring a better balance between multimodal content and collaborative signals.",

First, MIRM is fine-tuned for multimodal feature alignment. Then, a joint optimization framework integrates ID-based and content-based user embeddings using a contrastive learning mechanism to enhance recommendation performance.",
