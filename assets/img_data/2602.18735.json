Starting from Gaussian noise, the process iteratively refines a latent feature𝒙t\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}under the guidance of the partial input𝑺p\\boldsymbol{S}_{p}.

The ERS explicitly injects the known geometry of𝑺p\\boldsymbol{S}_{p}into𝒙t\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}to produce an updated latent𝒙t∗\\boldsymbol{x}^{*}_{t}.
