These features are then mapped to a low-dimensional space by the compressor, binary quantized, and projected back by the decompressor. The decoder resynthesizes the waveform from these features. All these modules are causal, while a non-causal teacher is used for distillation to align intermediate causal features with their non-causal counterparts.",
