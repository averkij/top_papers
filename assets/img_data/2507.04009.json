                "caption": "Figure 1:Overview of the Easy Dataset framework. The framework consists of two primary components: adaptive document processing and persona-driven data synthesis. In the first component, documents of different formats are processed via model-based parsing, followed by hybrid chunking to produce text chunks. In the second component,Genre-Audiencepairs are created for each document to guide the construction of diverse question-answer pairs. Persona-guided questions are then generated to further increase diversity, and final augmented QA pairs are synthesized via knowledge-enhanced prompting to ensure factual consistency. The entire framework provides interactive human-in-the-loop refinement to maintain data quality.",
