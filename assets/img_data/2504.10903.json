We categorize existing efficient reasoning methods into three key directions based on how they improve reasoning efficiency: (1) make long CoT short (shorter); (2) build small language model with strong reasoning ability (smaller); and (3) let decoding more efficient (faster).",

In addition, improving efficiency helps alleviate resource constraints and lower costs.",
