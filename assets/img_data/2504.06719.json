The scene is voxelized into two different views,(b), and then further cropped and masked,(c). The student model first encodes the cropped views and then adds the masked voxels with a learnable token,(d). The decoder processes the cropped views and reconstructs deep features of the masked tokens,(e). The loss is computed in a cross-view manner where the target features,(f), are obtained from a teacher model updated with EMA.",
