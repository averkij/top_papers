In unedited regions, the trajectory is nearly linear, allowing early-stage velocity to provide a reliable estimate of the multi-step denoised images, including the final result. In contrast, edited regions exhibit curved trajectories, making the final image harder to predict. Despite this, the velocity between consecutive timesteps remains consistent.",

In the STS, no acceleration is applied due to unstable DiT outputs, and all KV values are cached at the final step. In the RAGS, an Adaptive Region Partition distinguishes between edited and unedited regions: unedited regions are denoised in one step, while edited regions are generated iteratively. This iterative generation process leverages RIKVCache for injecting global information and AVDCache for acceleration. Certain forced-update steps aggregate the full image to refresh RIKVCache with complete DiT computation. Finally, in the SMS, several full denoising steps are performed to eliminate artifacts along the boundaries between edited and unedited regions.",
