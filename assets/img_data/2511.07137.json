The painting is passed through the painting encoder, where the extracted music features are incorporated via a fusion module. A regression head then predicts a perception score for each music-painting pair. We optimize the model using a regression loss based on the ground truth scores, and additionally apply a DPO loss to learn from pairwise preference annotations in ambiguous cases.",
