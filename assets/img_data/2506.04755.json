First, the Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) filters out samples that overly rely on language priors via output-level discrepancy. Then, the Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE) excludes attention-biased samples by token-level attention distributions. Finally, the Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) selectively replaces trivial instances with cognitively challenging ones, yielding a refined subset of cognitive samples.",
