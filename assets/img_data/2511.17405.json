The example (left) shows an unfaithful reasoning chain that eliminates distractors incorrectly yet provide a correct final answer, yielding a positive reward signal that, when used in reinforcement learning, further amplifies shortcut behavior (top right). This shortcut behavior leads to widening gap between MCQA and OpenQA. The diagram motivate us to propose ReVeL, which aligns evaluation and training with reliable OpenQA.",
