                "caption": "Figure 1:SCALE Framework Overview. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) Problem Decomposition - breaks the mathematical problem into sequential sub-problems; (2) Difficulty Assessment - computes difficulty scores for each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems; (3) Adaptive Mode Selection - assigns sub-problems to either fast processing (System 1) or deliberate reasoning (System 2) based on difficulty threshold; (4) Sequential Execution - processes sub-problems with full context propagation. This selective resource allocation concentrates computation on challenging sub-problems while efficiently handling routine ones.",
