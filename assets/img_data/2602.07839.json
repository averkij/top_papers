The system prioritizes a sequential “fetch-and-filter” pipeline to manage data dependencies, incorporating a periodic adaptation trigger to validate intermediate retrieval results before proceeding to the final synthesis and verification stage. This structure minimizes branching overhead for tasks where step-wise logical progression is paramount.",

This topology decomposes the problem into granular nodes (acquisition, filtering, and finalization). The navigation strategy employs a state-aware routing mechanism that dynamically selects between parallel extraction or sequential reasoning based on the current node status (\"pending\" vs. \"success\"), allowing the system to efficiently prune the search space while adhering to numerical constraints.",

The system identifies independent sub-goals (e.g., retrieving data for different players concurrently) and activates a “Parallel Executor” module to minimize latency. The adaptation layer monitors the synchronization of these concurrent streams, ensuring that the graph topology is only updated and merged when specific dependency conditions are met.",
