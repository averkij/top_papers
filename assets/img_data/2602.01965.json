In HippoRAG 2 (top), the static graph structure causes semantic drift; probability mass is diverted to high-weight generic edges (e.g.,Marie Curie→\\rightarrowRadioactivity), missing the downstream evidenceENS. CatRAG (bottom) prevents this by applying (1) Symbolic Anchoring, injecting \"University\" as a weak seed, (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting amplifying relevant paths (e.g.,Attend in ENS) while pruning irrelevant ones, and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement to strength, boosting relevant context edge. This steers the random walk to successfully retrieve the complete evidence chain forENS.",
