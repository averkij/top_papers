                "caption": "Figure 1:Framework ofverifier engineering: The fundamental stages of verifier engineering include Search, Verify, and Feedback. Given an instruction, the process begins with generating candidate responses (Search), followed by evaluating these candidates using appropriate verifier combinations (Verify), and concludes with optimizing the model’s output distribution (Feedback). This framework can explain various approaches, from training-based methods like RLHF(Ouyang et al.,2022a)to inference-based techniques such as OmegaPRM(Luo et al.,2024b)and Experiential Co-Learning(Qian et al.,2023). We systematically categorize existing approaches into these three stages in Table3.",
