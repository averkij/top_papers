The two key parts in AgentFold’ context are:Multi-Scale State Summaries(several folded blocks recording previous information) andLatest Interaction(a full record of the latest step). AgentFold responds with four blocks: thinking, folding, explanation, and tool call (which leads to an appended tool response). The folding directive has two operation modes: granular condensation that folds one single step with useful information reserved and deep consolidation that folds several steps with a coarse summary especially when these steps complete a sub-task and the intermediate details are not critical for further task-solving.",
