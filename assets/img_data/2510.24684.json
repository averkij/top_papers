The Challenger uses a raw document (which does not contain existing questions or labels) from a corpus to generate a (qq,a∗a^{*}) pair. Depending on the contents of the document, theChallengercan generate either a closed-form multiple choice question or a free-form question with different answer types (integer, float, expression). TheChallengergets rewarded for questions with high variance inReasoner’s correctness, and theReasonergets rewarded for answering questions correctly.",
