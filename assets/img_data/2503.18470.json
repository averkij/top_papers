Given room images, user preferences, and object status, the model generates a JSON-formatted object layout with precise (x, y, z) coordinates and a reasoning process. It evaluates the layout using three reward signals: Format Detection, Physical Detection, and Rendering-based Evaluation. The RL updates are based on multiple multi-turn refinement trajectories, optimizing a grouped policy via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable the VLM to learn deeper spatial reasoning from diverse refinement outcomes.",
