Feature tokens are generated by extracting features from both group centers and point groups, utilizing the Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) module in linear complexity. Then, feature tokens are input into the Encoder-Decoder, employing Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism, which can memorize new class information and discard redundant information. Finally, the feature tokens are reconstructed again via Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module, which can help the model review past samples and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Anomalies are detected according to the anomaly score by comparing the differences between feature tokens and reconstruction tokens.",
