We collect weak supervision signals of the mapping from questions to relation paths by identifying the shortest traversal sequence from topic entities to answers. We predefine 5 constraints, such as type, multi-entity, and ordinal constraints, following[17]which employs them to develop the ComplexQuestions dataset but does not leverage the prior in reasoning.",
