However, these tools are tailored solely to the immediate problem, making them non-reusable for other tasks and still prone to errors.\n(c) Ours. We propose a framework capable of reusing tool creation experience. During the inference process for task solving, UCT can utilize, create, and self-evolve existing tools. Furthermore, we design an offline memory consolidation module to generalize tool memory and transform it into reusable tool experience assets.",
