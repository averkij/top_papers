The data reveals a strong negative linear relationship, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ\\rho) of-0.863and an R-squared value of0.746. This provides strong quantitative evidence that a less coherent contextual pathway (lower DSS) is a primary and predictable vulnerability leading to higher rates of hallucination.",
