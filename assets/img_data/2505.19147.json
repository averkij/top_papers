By mid-2024, with model sizes approaching 1000B parameters, their growth hasslowed down. Consequently, the focus has shifted toexpandingcontext lengthto further enhance model capabilities. This paradigm shift necessitates a transition todata-centric compression, emphasizing context length reduction for model efficiency.",
