                "caption": "Figure 1:Comparison of reranking paradigms. For rankingNNdocuments given a query, three primary approaches are compared based on their complexity and efficiency. ThePointwisemethod operates without inter-document comparison, allowing for exact, concurrent solving withO​(N)O(N)complexity, though yielding poorer performance. TheListwiseapproach uses sliding windows for approximation, achieving better results due to comparison, but is sequential and non-concurrent withO​(N/w)O(N/w)complexity. OurGroupwisemethod enables document comparison and score output, offering high effectiveness. Crucially, it retains the benefit of exact solving and concurrency, achievingO​(N/c)O(N/c)complexity. Meanwhile, c denotes the number of documents compared per request, and w denotes the sliding window.",

Finally, we apply a weighted fusion to these two sets of annotations to generate highly reliable final scores and a ranked list. This output is ideal for training a GroupRank and can also be used for training Retrievers or other Rerankers.",
