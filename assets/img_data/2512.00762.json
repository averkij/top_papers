This approach enables applications such as physics-based video generation, where new objects can be seamlessly introduced into a scene and simulated within the same force field. Force strength: fromlowtohigh(best viewed in colors).",

Objects are represented with 3D Gaussians and assigned physical properties via Vision-Language Models. Forces are modeled as a causal tri-plane, and object motions are simulated using a differentiable physics simulator. A sparse tracking objective enables robust differentiable force recovery from videos.",
