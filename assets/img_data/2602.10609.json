                "caption": "Figure 1:Illustration of local structural off-policy patterns. Raw token-level importance-sampling (IS) ratios (blue) exhibit high local variance and structural inconsistency, whereas a sequence-level IS ratio (purple) is globally smooth but obscures within-sequence structure. Off-policy frequency increases over the sequence (window-wise statistics), off-policy runs are short-lived (run-length distribution), and token states switch frequently, suggesting weak local coherence. Token-level Kalman filtering (red) yields locally smoothed yet structurally consistent IS ratios.",
