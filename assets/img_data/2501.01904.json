The “average thought length” is represented by the line, while “performance” is indicated by the bar. The bars in light color represent Vigor’s performance, while the bars in dark color represent Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct’s performance. We observe that benchmarks with longer thought lengths generally correspond to greater performance improvements.",
