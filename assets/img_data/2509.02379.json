Self-distillation loss is applied to the CLS tokens and masking loss applied to dense patch tokens. b). Stage 2: Adds gram anchoring. Gram teacher sees a higher resolution global crop and outputs dense feature maps, resized to match student resolution. Stage 3: Both student and teacher are trained with higher-res CT inputs (not shown). c). Finetuning pretrained MedDINOv3 for segmentation with proposed architecture.",
