The CCoT involves three main phases: (1) Agent Instantiation, followed by iterative cycles of (2) Parallel Proposal Generation and (3) Competition and Consensus Arbitration for each of thedddays. During arbitration, the system synthesizes the top-kkproposals into a daily plan. Finally, aConstraint-Gated RLmodule refines the consensus itinerary to simultaneously optimize both soft constraints (personalization) and hard constraints (feasibility).",
