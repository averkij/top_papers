(a) Visualization of token-level predicted probabilities, where deeper red indicates lower probabilities. Teacher-generated traces exhibit frequent self-talk behaviors, which conveys little reasoning content yet receives low probabilities. (b) Tracking the probabilities of self-talk-behavior tokens across training stages reveals that they remain persistently lower than the average probabilities, suggesting that these semantically uninformative expressions exert disproportionate influence on gradient updates.",
