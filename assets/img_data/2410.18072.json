The video generation model generates corresponding predicted videos based on the current instructions and real-time observations. Using a pre-trained IDM or a goal-based policy, the agent executes the generated sequence of actions. After a fixed timestep, the predicted video is refreshed by sampling again from the video generation model, and this process repeats. Finally, the success rates of various embodied tasks are obtained through monitors in the simulation environment.",
