The input point cloud and textual description are processed by CLIP Vision and Text Encoders, respectively. Cross-attention mechanisms fuse these features within a Multi-Modal Decoder, enabling the generation of descriptive captions. The model training is guided by contrastive and captioning losses, promoting effective alignment between visual and textual modalities.",
