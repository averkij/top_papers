A Complex query is composed of multiple sub-queries with strong logical reasoning relationships; in contrast, the sub-queries of a Compound query are almost independent. Synchronous retrieval is necessary for the former, while asynchronous retrieval is more efficient for the latter.",

The bottom-left section outlines the workflow of ANRAG, which determines the relevance between the document and the query, ensuring that only noise-free documents are passed to the generation model. The right-hand section provides a detailed depiction of how HANRAG handles four different types of queries: Straightforward queries are directly answered using the LLM; for Single-step queries, ANRAG is employed to derive the answer; Compound queries are addressed using asynchronous retrieval followed by result merging; and for Complex queries, synchronous retrieval is utilized, alternating between retrieval, generation, and termination evaluation to produce the final outcome.All functions, apart from the LLM and the Retriever, are managed by the Revelator module.",
