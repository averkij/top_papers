Standard DPO (Red) exhibits a characteristicdistribution collapse, where the rigid historical constraints force the model to degrade its linguistic capabilities to satisfy the reward (P​P​L→102.3PPL\\rightarrow 102.3). In contrast, DZ-TDPO (Blue) maintains a stable trajectory (P​P​L→26.0PPL\\rightarrow 26.0), confirming that our structural bias effectively decouples conflict resolution from general linguistic modeling.",

The steeper slope of the hypothetical curve illustrates the stronger penalty required if we were to prioritize conflict resolution over stability; however, our fixed prior (λ=0.5\\lambda=0.5) strikes a balanced trade-off, effectively suppressing outdated information on distant history to resolve temporal conflicts.",
