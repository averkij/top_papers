Twelve models (86%) exhibit positive bias (Δ=+10.81\\Delta=+10.81pp,p=0.0280∗p=0.0280^{*},d=0.66d=0.66). Top-tier models show minimal bias (<2<2pp), while lower-tier models show severe bias (up to+46.9+46.9pp). Negative correlation (ρ=−0.565∗\\rho=-0.565^{*}) indicates higher reasoning ability reduces reliance on semantic heuristics.",
