We begin by curating high-quality scene blocks and adapting SLAT to better model structured 3D context. A 3D block inpainting module enables spatially coherent extension, while a coarse-to-fine generation strategy ensures global layout plausibility and local detail fidelity. Together, these components allow WorldGrow to progressively construct photorealistic and structurally consistent 3D worlds with theoretically unbounded spatial extent.",
