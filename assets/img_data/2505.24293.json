The detached Jacobian matrices for each token represent a near-exact local linearization of the predicted output embedding. A) We show the features which drive large responses in single units in the last decoder layer, which are the rows of the detached Jacobian with the largest norm values, and decode each of those into the most likely input embedding token. The blue list of words at the top are the ordered decoded “feature” input tokens from the largest rows of the detached Jacobian matrix for the beginning of sequence token, and the different colors show the decoded feature tokens for the other input tokens. A similar operation is carried out for columns of the largest norm values, which are decoded to the output token space. Note that the activation distribution of column magnitudes is fairly sparse, with only a few features driving the response. B) We take the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian matrix corresponding to each input token, which summarizes the modes driving the response, and decode the left and right singular vectorsU𝑈Uitalic_UandV𝑉Vitalic_Vto output and input embeddings, shown in colors. The singular value spectrum is extremely low rank, and decoding theU𝑈Uitalic_Usingular vectors returns candidate output tokens: “most” and “one” appear frequently.
