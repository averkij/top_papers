Given the current observation, the LLM policy initially proposesBuild Supply Depot. A 5-second rollout by the world model predicts that minerals will drop to 50 and the supply depot will be 23% complete, while unused supply remains 18. Based on this prediction, the system revises the action toTrain SCV, avoiding premature infrastructure expenditure that would lead to mineral shortage. This example illustrates that incorporating a world model can improve macro-management decision-making.",
