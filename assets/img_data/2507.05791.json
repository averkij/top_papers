At each step, the trajectory, current UI screenshot, and user instruction are sent to a planner, which samples multiple action proposals. A multimodal large language model judge is then used to select the best candidate action proposal. When the candidate action proposal is a coordinate-based action (e.g., a click), the grounding model predicts a precise interaction point on the GUI for executing the action. For non-coordinate-based actions (e.g., key presses), the action can be executed directly without grounding.",
