                "caption": "Figure 2:Overview ofSRENDER.Given an image and a target camera trajectory, a keyframe density predictor predicts the optimal keyframe density for the depicted scene and camera trajectory. Keyframe poses are then uniformly sampled along the trajectory before being fed to the keyframe generation model together with the input image for generating keyframes. A 3D reconstruction model takes the keyframes and generates the 3D representation of the scene. Finally, the video is rendered from the 3D scene along the input camera trajectory.",

Output frames at 4s and 14s are visualized. Our method achieves both high video quality and camera control. HG[43]often has high-frequency artifacts. Voyager[19]fails at generating a consistent long video sequence.\nWe also show results with 2D interpolation methods[21,40], which show strong morphing effects, and also cannot satisfy the intermediate camera control inputs.",
