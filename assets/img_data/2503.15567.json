The UAE-3D encodes 3D molecules from molecular space into a unified latent space, integrating multi-modal features such as atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. This unified latent space is then utilized by the UDM-3D, which employs a DiT to perform generative modeling. Then the denoised latents are decoded back into 3D molecules.",
