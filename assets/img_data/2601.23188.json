When abnormal mismatches are detected, a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor  (§3.3) is triggered to perform reflective diagnosis using success and failure experiences stored in metacognitive memory, and to issue corrective guidance for subsequent steps. The memory is continuously updated and consolidated online, enabling efficient and experience-driven regulation of deep search execution.",
