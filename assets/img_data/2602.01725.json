During the CUA decision-making phase, the agent receives device states and generates candidate actions.SafePredprocesses these candidate actions through three stages: (1)Policy Integration: External policies are converted into structured representations that serve as the policy basis for risk prediction. (2)Risk Prediction: Short- and long-term predictions are generated across different time scales. Short-term prediction evaluates whether the current action may cause immediate risks, while long-term prediction assesses potential delayed risks. Feedback signals are then produced, indicating eitherNeed RegenerationorPASS. (3)Decision Optimization: If the signal isNeed Regeneration, predicted risks are integrated into step-level risk guidance and task-level plan guidance, prompting the agent to update its decision. If the signal isPASS, the candidate action is executed directly.",
