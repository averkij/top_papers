The figure uses gray edges to represent the agent’s autonomous actions and blue edges to indicate human intervention. The process begins with the agent attempting the task independently (Step1) and navigating to the interface to list available forums (Step2). At this stage, the agent gets stuck, unable to locate the desired ‘space’ forum. A human intervenes (Step3), guiding the agent to the correct forum. The user then resumes the agent’s operation (Step4), allowing it to retrieve the required post and complete the task by navigating to the comments section (Step5).\"",
