The MSE loss is computed only on masked regions between𝐳predicted\\mathbf{z}_{\\text{predicted}}and𝐳target\\mathbf{z}_{\\text{target}}(stop-gradient), with gradients backpropagating only through the online encoder and predictor. The target encoder provides stable representations without receiving gradients directly(Grill2020BYOL).",

Input waveform passes through an initial Conv1D layer followed by 5 encoder blocks, each containing Conv1D with stride, SnakeBeta activation, residual blocks, and Gaussian Adaptive Attention gating. Features are projected through a bottleneck Conv1D layer and processed by 8 Conformer blocks (each with FNN, multi-head attention with 16 heads, depthwise convolution, and a second FNN) to produce the final representation𝐳\\mathbf{z}. The target encoder shares this architecture but is updated via exponential moving average rather than backpropagation.",
