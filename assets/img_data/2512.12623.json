(A) Text-only reasoning: relies solely on explicit CoT, often causing visual grounding errors and redundant steps. (B) Think-with-Image reasoning: depends on external perception tools, leading to unstable tool calls and extra overhead. (C) DMLR (ours): refines latent think tokens in the latent space through confidence-guided optimization and dynamically injects visual information, achieving self-improving reasoning without additional training while maintaining high efficiency.",
