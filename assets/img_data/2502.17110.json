The baseline agent, lacking operation knowledge, struggles to complete the task, requiring excessive steps and still failing. Manually written knowledge requires documentation and iterative verification. In contrast, Mobile-Agent-V leverages operation videos, requiring only execution and recording, making knowledge injection far more efficient.",
