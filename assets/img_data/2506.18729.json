The musical attribute offers control over elements such as melody, rhythm, and dynamics, whereas the audio condition enables audio inpainting and outpainting.We train the two pipelines separately with two sets of adapters, but users can choose to use either one or both at the inference time.",

After training, a portion of the attention maps exhibits a perfectly diagonal pattern when given the full audio condition.\nWhen performing inpainting or outpainting (i.e., only partial audio condition is given), the model tends to reference previous keys, exhibiting effective usage of given audio context.",
