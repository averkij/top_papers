The Crawler processes the user query and can access papers from the paper queue. It can autonomously invoke the search tool, expand citations, or stop processing of the current paper. All papers collected by the Crawler are appended to the paper queue. The Selector reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the criteria specified in the user query.",
