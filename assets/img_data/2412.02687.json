These baselines demonstrate notable instability, leading to variability in image quality metrics such as FID. In contrast, our approach, which employs CFG with randomly selected values from a uniform distribution, results in a more stable training process and generates higher-quality samples.",

As shown, simply applying CFG to a one-step generator is equivalent to blending (i.e., adding) two images together, resulting in an unusable output. Alternatively, negating the negative embedding from the positive embedding shows minimal impact on the final image. In contrast,NASAis the first method to successfully steer the generation away from negative attributes in a one-step generator, while also producing high-quality results.",
