Rows correspond to distinct behavioral regimes: Swarm (a–c), Torus (d–f), Dynamic Parallel (g–i), and Highly Parallel (j–l). Columns represent temporal snapshots at initial (t=0t=0), middle (t=T/2t=T/2), and final (t=Tt=T) simulation times. Three-dimensional quiver plots display fish positions with velocity vectors; instantaneous polarizationPPand rotationMMvalues are annotated for each panel. The Swarm configuration maintains disordered aggregation throughout, while the Torus case transitions from initial milling (M=0.95M=0.95) toward partial alignment. Both Dynamic Parallel and Highly Parallel cases exhibit rapid ordering from random initial conditions to coherent directed motion (P>0.98P>0.98).",

Each panel displays polarizationPP(solid lines) and rotationMM(dashed lines) as functions of time, with horizontal dotted lines indicating equilibrium mean values computed over the second half of each simulation. Panel annotations report final values. (a) Swarm: both parameters fluctuate near zero with no sustained ordering. (b) Torus: initial high rotation decays while polarization grows, indicating transition from milling toward partial alignment. (c) Dynamic Parallel: rapid convergence toP≈0.98P\\approx 0.98withint≈30t\\approx 30time units. (d) Highly Parallel: fastest convergence to near-unity polarization (P=0.998P=0.998) with minimal fluctuations (σP=0.0003\\sigma_{P}=0.0003).",
