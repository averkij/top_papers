The noise sequencextix_{t}^{i}is concatenated with the original sequencex0ix_{0}^{i}and fed into the language model. A noisy block can see information about the preceding blocks in the corresponding clean sequence (offset block causal) and other positions within the same block (block diagonal). During inference, the attention pattern of the clean sequence is used (block causal). The model performs denoising prediction and finally computes the loss at the masked noisy positions.",
