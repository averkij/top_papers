We use object detection, clustering and text based filtering to generate a subset of vehicle candidate objects which are subsequently labeled. We then train the High-Quality Car Classifier using the labeled 3D-Car-Quality Dataset. After training we used the trained classifiert to automatically generate the High-Quality Car Dataset which is finally manually reviwed and annotated.",
