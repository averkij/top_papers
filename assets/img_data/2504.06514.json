When queried by questions with missing premises, the response length of reasoning models increases excessively, and they cannot abstain from answering with MiP identified. The left shows a query with an undefined variable, while the right compares a well-defined GSM8K question with its MiP variant (with a critical numerical condition removed). Reasoning models’ responses to MiP questions are much longer than those for well-defined questions and those generated by non-reasoning models. The left corner of each response report the response length and thinking time by DeepSeek-R1.",
