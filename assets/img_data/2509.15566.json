Specifically, colorful text is supervised by rule-based reinforcement learning. And different colors of text indicate different reward rules. The previous “Think-Answer” framework is optimized by format reward, action type reward, and corresponding args reward. And our “Blink-Think-Link” framework is optimized by dual format reward, blink reward, and link reward.",

Furthermore, GRPO computes the relative advantages within a group of completions, eliminating the need for manually annotated data. Finally, the policy model updates parameters under the guidance of relative advantages and the KL divergence constraint.",

In the example shown in the figure, the instruction for the current step is “Use the GPS to locate a nearby museum and then book a ride with Lyft.” Accordingly, the most relevant element in the Blink output is the “Maps & Navigation” app with ¡ID¿10¡/ID¿.",
