The vanilla feature space lacks uniformity and is dominated by samples from the Many-shot region. In contrast, our approach achieves a more uniform distribution over the feature space, improving the performance, especially in the Medium and Few-shot regions.

The first row corresponds to the original UCI Airfoil Dataset[2], while the second row corresponds to its curated version, with an additional few-shot region in the middle of the label range. Colored arrows point to the few-shot regions and their corresponding positions in the feature distributions. We evaluate feature distributions using: MSE Loss (Baseline), SRL without uniformity loss (w/o‚Ñíenvsubscript‚Ñíenv\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{env}}caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT env end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), SRL without homogeneity loss (w/o‚Ñíhomosubscript‚Ñíhomo\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{homo}}caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT homo end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), and complete SRL (ours). The baseline leads to feature collapse to many-shot regions and inadequate distinction of few-shot samples. In w/o‚Ñíenvsubscript‚Ñíenv\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{env}}caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT env end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, features collapse into a trivial shape, not fully utilizing the feature space. In w/o‚Ñíhomosubscript‚Ñíhomo\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{homo}}caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT homo end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, features spread out along the trace. Different from the previous ones, our SRL uniformly and smoothly ‚Äúfills‚Äù the feature space.",
