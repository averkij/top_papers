For instance, model activations of random prompts are, on average, highly negative in the direction of SAE feature 4888. The SAE offsets this default component with a positive encoder bias term (86.20), resulting in SAE activations around zero (right-hand axis). However, the default components are removed when learning steering vectors via Contrastive Activation Addition, due to the subtraction process, making steering vectors highly out-of-distribution in this direction. Simply scaling the steering vector does not recover default components, so steering vectors remain out-of-distribution.SV: Corrigibility steering vector.PositiveandNegative promptsare the Contrastive Activation Addition prompts.Random promptsare from the Pile[6].",

However, while the steering vector has a strong negative projection in this direction, SAEs are not designed to accommodate negative coefficients, resulting in an activation of0.000.000.000.00.Right:Feature 3517 rarely activates for either prompt type. However, since it has negative cosine similarity with feature 14004 (-0.82), the steering vector shows a strong positive projection in this direction, causing feature 3517 to spuriously activate. All prompt activations are taken at the answer token position.",
