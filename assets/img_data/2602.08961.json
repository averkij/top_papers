We only add noise to the 4D latents during model training for the Diffusion version.\nNote that we do not enforce the 4D latent distribution to strictly align with the original SVD VAE latent distribution.\nAnd we find that this relaxed training strategy consistently improves the generalization performance of both the VAE and the Diffusion Unet.",

For outdoor scenes, our method estimates a more accurate scene structure. Notably, our method, like VGGT, can directly output point clouds in world coordinates without requiring post-optimization steps such as Geo4D. Furthermore, our method has a much smaller training scale than VGGT, yet exhibits good robustness in dynamic scenes. We attribute this to pre-training knowledge of video diffusion and our proposed training strategy.",
