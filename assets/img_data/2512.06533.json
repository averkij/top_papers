The model performs multiple sampling trials to generate several discrete token sequences (e.g., the binary representation<1><1><0>). These sequences are individually detokenized into corresponding scalar values (shown in the stacked layers asy^1=6,y^2=5,y^3=7\\hat{y}_{1}=6,\\hat{y}_{2}=5,\\hat{y}_{3}=7). Finally, these scalar values are combined via an aggregation strategy (e.g., median) to produce the final predictiony^=6\\hat{y}=6.",
