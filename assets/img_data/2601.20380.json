The pipeline proceeds through four distinct layers: (1) a hybrid data processing stage integrating automated LLM-assisted annotation and human-in-the-loop refinement; (2) SFT of an MoE foundation model; (3) decoupled RL using GRPO with tailored rewards for grounding and navigation tasks; and (4) final deployment of the optimized agents across diverse application environments.",
