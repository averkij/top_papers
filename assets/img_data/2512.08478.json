The generated Gaussians are then combined with optional mesh assets and passed into aWebGPU-based hybrid rendering pipeline, where depth-aware composition produces the final image. In the post-processing stage,ONNX-based generative models can be optionally applied for tasks such as stylization and enhancement, yielding the final output.",
