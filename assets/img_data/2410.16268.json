(a) When an occlusion occurs, SAM 2 may lose track or follow the wrong object, leading to accumulated errors. In contrast, SAM2Long utilizes memory tree search to recover when the object reappears. (b) The per-frame𝒥&ℱ𝒥ℱ\\mathcal{J}\\&\\mathcal{F}caligraphic_J & caligraphic_Fscores of the predicted masks are plotted at specific timestamps on the LVOS and SA-V datasets. SAM2Long demonstrates greater resilience to elapsed time compared to SAM 2, maintaining superior performance over longer periods.",
