The process begins with a property identifier agent ((a) RAG Crew) that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to filter relevant articles. The remaining four agents are strategically organised into two parallel functional subgroups: one dedicated to composition data extraction ((b) Composition Crew Set) and the other focused on synthesis information collection ((c) Synthesis Crew Set). Each subgroup implements a sequential two-agent architecture—the first agent extracts raw data while the second performs formatting and standardisation. The workflow integrates two essential tools: RAGTool for discriminating between mere property mentions and actual quantitative property values, and MaterialParserTool for accurate processing of complex chemical formulations.",
