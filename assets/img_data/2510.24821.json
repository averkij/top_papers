Specifically, in image generation,Ming-Flash-Omniintroduces a novel generative segmentation paradigm to achieve fine-grained spatial and semantic control over the generated images. Moreover,Ming-Flash-Omnisignificantly enhances Context-Aware Speech Recognition (ContextASR) and Chinese dialect recognition, thereby broadening its applicability in real-world scenarios.",

Speech generation now uses continuous features instead of discrete tokens, and image generation has been upgraded with support for segmentation.",
