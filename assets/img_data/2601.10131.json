The first two blocks involveRetrieval and Prototyping, where molecular candidates are first retrieved based on the given constraints (QED, LogP, MW) and then analyzed by a local reasoner to extract constraints, analyze retrieved molecules, and propose an editing plan based on evaluator’s feedback to generate prototypes iteratively. The third block describesMulti-Hop Optimization, where the prototypes are optimized through one-hop and n-hop controllable editing steps by the molecule optimizer trained by GRPO.",
