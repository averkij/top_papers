Our method, which uses Gemini with prompts on goals and constraints, achieves a 1.6x speed-up (from 19.8min to 10.4min) with 86% coverage.\nWe show 3D representation of where the 2-agents (orange/blue) are and their camera views. P1 is mostly left to do the cooking, while P2 is washing up and ordering.Bottom.3-Body parallel execution achieving further 2.3x speed-up to 7.5min. P2 is washing up while P3 is drying and storing things away.\nFor the full output, see supp and supp video.",
