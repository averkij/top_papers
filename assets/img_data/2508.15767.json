This level of control is difficult to accomplish in prior work[39]due to undesirable correlations between joints and vertices,e.g. adjusting shoulder width affects the entire body and increasing weight reverses the shoulder adjustment. With ATLAS’s decoupled skeleton and shape, this customization is a simple two-step deterministic edit.",
