Error residuals are accumulated at each iteration until they reach a threshold for making a discrete change. QES achieves temporal equivalence to high-precision optimization trajectory, while maintaining a memory at the same level as inference-only quantized models.",

QuZO (Orange) performance is unstable and training collapses especially in the coarser INT4 landscape and with the smaller base model. In contrast, QES (Green) progresses steadily closely tracking the Full Residual Oracle (Blue) despite using significantly less memory.",

While the reward function can be optimized with a high-precision gradient ascent, that method cannot be applied to the discrete case. Instead, the gradient needs to be estimated without vanishing signals or inaccurate moves between grid points. That is the challenge that QES is designed to solve.",
