We outline a long-term vision of world models that can simulate a broad range of environments across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The figure highlights four foundational characteristics: real-time responsiveness, stochasticity, multi-scale planning, and intrinsic physical faithfulness. These collectively support the long-term goal of zero-shot generalization.",
