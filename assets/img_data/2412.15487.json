The total word count of this example article was 7,671 and the word count of the reference summary was 172. We highlight the inflection sentence which most serves as the transition from the actual background and theoretical setup of the paper to the actual methodologies which are then detailed in later text. From here we gather the word count of everything before the inflection sentence and classify it as our reference introduction text for experimentation, including the inflection sentence. In this case, the resulting introduction section had a total word count of 1203.",
