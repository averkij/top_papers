In contrast, VTC leverages lightweight rendering to transform long textual reasoning traces into compact visual representations, enabling VLMs to encode information with significantly fewer vision tokens (3-4× compression). This approach is both lightweight and model-free.",

At each iteration, the current reasoning segment is generated and the preceding segments are rendered into compact images, which are fed back to the model together with the original question. These rendered images function as a form of optical memory, enabling efficient multi-step reasoning with reduced token usage.",
