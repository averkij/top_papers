For math reasoning tasks, the model performs PRM-guided beam search, where the number of candidate steps (2/4/8) serves as a proxy for thinking mode complexity. At each step, the policy model selects the top-scoring candidate , infers reasoning difficulty, and dynamically switches to the corresponding mode. The framework further incorporates progressive switching, rapid error recovery, and appropriate penalization mechanisms.",
