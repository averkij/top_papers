FreeScale starts with pure Gaussian noise and progressively denoises it using the training resolution.\nAn image is then generated via the VAE decoder, followed by upscaling to obtain a higher-resolution one.\nWe gradually add noise to the latent of this higher-resolution image and incorporate this forward noise into the denoising process of the higher-resolution latent with the use ofrestrained dilated convolution.\nAdditionally, for intermediate latent steps, we enhance high-frequency details by applying region-aware detail control using masks derived from the image.\n(b)Scale Fusion.\nDuring denoising, we adapt the self-attention layer to a global and local attention structure.\nBy utilizing Gaussian blur, we fuse high-frequency details from global attention and low-frequency semantics from local attention, serving as the final output of the self-attention layer.",
