There is an anomalous peak for Harris, when Biden dropped out, because before that date there was lesser mentions about Harris, which peaked when she was brought forward as the Democratic Presidential Candidate.The national polls are derived by soliciting the polls from the public and weighting them according to their influence, while the sentiment plot reflects the temperament of the radio content. We observe similar trends in both, suggesting that the radio content can be used as a proxy of its listeners’ sentiment.",
