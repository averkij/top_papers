On the left (a canonical task consisting of independent subproblems organised in a tree structure), the task is to concatenate the last letters of a list of names, accomplished by breaking the list in two, finding their solutions, and recombining them. On the right (an extension of the canonical structure to handle sequential tasks), the task is to determine the final position of an object after a series of steps. We first find its position after half of the steps, and then determine the final position by tracing the object through the remaining steps. See Section3for a description of ToP.",
