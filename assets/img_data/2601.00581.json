                "caption": "Figure 1:The AceFF-2 architecture TensorNet2 builds upon TensorNetTensorNetwith the new components colored in blue. The main change is that after the tensor embedding, and each tensor interaction block, a set of partial chargesqqand weightswware computed and undergo a neutral charge equilibration (NQE) procedure as done in AIMNet2anstine2024aimnet2. The partial charges are then combined with edge features during the tensor interaction. The predicted charges are used to compute a Coulomb energyECoulombE_{\\text{Coulomb}}alongside the standard short range node-wise MLIP energy termEiE_{i}. The dashed arrow represents where iteration occurs for more than one interaction layer. The pictured diagram corresponds to TensorNet2 1-layer. The grey dashed circles around the example molecule illustrate the short cutoffs used in the tensor embedding and interaction. The blue dashed circle represents the long range of the total charge (a global feature feature), NQE block, and the Coulomb interaction.",
