Left: training closes a generate–diagnose–refine cycle: policy LLM generates code, pages rendered to temporal screenshots, and a vision-aware critic (MLLM) provides scores and feedback. Rewards combine visual scoring and format constraints; the policy is optimized with GRPO. Right: at inference the model runs a lightweight Re-Look cycle — external critic may be omitted for latency or used for higher accuracy.",
