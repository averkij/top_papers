In Video Curation stage, in-the-wild videos are filtered by LLMs or VLMs to remove motionless ones based on captions or visual cues. During Geometric Clue Extraction, vision foundation models extract key geometric cues, including camera poses, point clouds, object masks and orientations. Finally, in Data Generation, object coordinates are transformed into a randomly selected viewpoint and question–answer pairs are produced using either predefined templates or LLM-based free-form generation.",
