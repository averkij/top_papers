Bottom: NLL response of Llama-Mimi-1.3B with standard error margins. Response on negative samples show localized spike within a short temporal window after the transition in contrast to the positive sample. Global token perplexity aggregates likelihood contributions outside this localized region (Sec.2.2), making it susceptible to long-range loss volatility, thereby motivating our localized and normalized evaluation methods (Sec.3.1,3.2)",

In (a1), we correlate scores from proposed methods against those from global token perplexity (Global-PPL); the horizontal spread highlights the discrepancy across evaluation methods. The alternative methods rate strong models more favorably thanGlobal-PPL, substantially closing the gap to the human topline. In (a2), we correlate deviations from the proposed methods againstGlobal-PPLscores. Deviations generally become larger at higherGlobal-PPLperformance (blue), until it saturates due to the maximum performance ceiling (orange). Negative deviations exhibit a similar trend in absolute magnitude, though this is less surprising since they are soft-bounded by distance to random baseline (green).",
