To bolster the model’s semantic comprehension, the training process alternates between animation data (with probabilitypanip_{\\text{ani}}) and a diverse text-to-video dataset (with probability1−pani1-p_{\\text{ani}}).\nThe DiT is initialized from a pretrained T2V model and fine-tuned using LoRA.\nFinally, a VAE decoder reconstructs the video. Note that the Unbind module and mixed-data training are applied exclusively during the training phase.",
