While Claude-3.5-Sonnet concludes \"none of the options,\" its reasoning steps lack full alignment with the observed logic (highlighted in red). Gemini-1.5-Flash demonstrates weaker reasoning with less logical coherence details (highlighted in red). Our LlamaV-o1 provides better and more systematic reasoning, identifying that option D follows the established pattern, thereby showcasing its logical reasoning capability.

Each example emphasizes step-by-step reasoning, starting from task comprehension and progressing to logical inference and answer generation. The tasks include mathematical reasoning using geometric principles, scientific classification based on molecular structures, visual interpretation of charts and diagrams, artistic identification from historical paintings, and medical diagnosis from tissue images.\nFor instance, one example demonstrates the calculation of an angle in a geometric diagram by leveraging linear pairs and perpendicular relationships. Another highlights scientific reasoning by identifying ethane as a compound based on its molecular composition. Visual perception tasks challenge the model to analyze pie charts for global energy reserves or recognize reflected shapes. Artistic and cultural tasks require identifying paintings and sports based on visual and contextual cues. Finally, tasks in medical imaging and advertisement recognition test the model’s ability to classify tissue types or extract product names through careful observation.",

Additionally, it includes specialized areas such as medical imaging (e.g., MMMU-Medical[72]with 29 samples), cultural and social understanding (e.g., ALM-Bench[57]with 104 samples), and document understanding through OCR (e.g., Doc-VQA[46]with 61 samples). By integrating tasks like chart and diagram comprehension (e.g., Chart-VQA[44]with 107 samples), our dataset not only covers a broad spectrum of real-world applications but also expand LMM’s ability to reason, perceive, and interpret complex multimodal information.(Right)The bar chart compares various SoTA reasoning models on the VRC-Bench, highlighting both final answer accuracy and step-by-step reasoning scores. The models evaluated for complex reasoning tasks include GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Llava-CoT. Our benchmark evaluates models not only on their ability to generate accurate final answers but also on the coherence and logical flow of their reasoning steps. Our approach, LlamaV-o1, outperforms GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llava-CoT in the VRC-Bench, achieving superior results in final answer accuracy across complex multimodal reasoning tasks.",
