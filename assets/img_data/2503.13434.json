Both branches use concatenated inputs of noisy latents and reference conditions (Sec.3.1). (2) A self-supervised training paradigm for element-level manipulation through stochastic position generation and target reconstruction optimization. Through feature fusion between branches, our framework achieves precise control over elements while maintaining visual coherence.",

In contrast,BlobCtrlachieves superior results across all operations while maintaining both identity preservation and visual harmony. We recommend zooming in to examine the source images and element-level manipulation instructions in detail.",
