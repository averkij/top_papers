P-GenRM infers a scenario-specific user persona and preference analysis from hybrid preference signals, generates dynamic scoring rubrics, and assesses candidate responses accordingly. At test-time, P-GenRM can aggregate multiple individual-level scoring schemes and incorporate similar users’ preferences to improve scoring accuracy and generalization.",

Each cluster corresponds to a learned prototype, around which users with similar preferences are grouped.

(2) Across different clusters, users demonstrate clearly distinct preference tendencies, underscoring the effectiveness of prototype-based modeling for capturing both intra-group commonality and inter-group heterogeneity.",
