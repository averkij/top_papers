We develop a diverse suite of dual-arm tasks and introduce a contingency mechanism during action execution to simulate real-world uncertainties. Building on these capabilities, our simulator provides a more challenging and complete benchmark to evaluate high-level planning capabilities for embodied VLMs and systems.",
