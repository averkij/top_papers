We select only those summaries containing at least five explanation sentences, resulting in a total of 116 summaries. Note that this experiment is conducted at the summary level. A higher change percentage indicates a metric is more sensitive to the explanation information, implying that such metrics may not effectively verify the factuality of PLS. Ideally, we expect the score change percentage to increase slowly. Among the metrics evaluated, only AlignScore, SummaC, and our method show this expected pattern.",
