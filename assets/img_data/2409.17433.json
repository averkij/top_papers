Overall, it is a dual-path hybrid thinking approach, beginning with a CoT solver for initial fast reasoning followed by verification of each reasoning step. If verification fails, the process transitions to a slower, more deliberate ”Dynamic Workflow Solver.” This solver iterates until a verified answer is obtained, incorporating a final verification step before concluding with a solution.",

Step 1 involves brainstorming and generating high-level descriptions of new reasoning tasks, either inspired by human-written tasks or directly writing puzzle tasks. Step 1 produces 45K descriptions of reasoning tasks. Step 2 performs semantic matching and deduplication and results in 18K reasoning task descriptions. The final Step 3 writes concrete questions based on task descriptions and applies a CoT validation process to filter or refine the tasks down to 27k valid reasoning problems.",
