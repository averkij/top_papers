A unified Diffusion-Transformer with a shared RGBA-VAE enables both text-to-PSD layered generation (left) and image-to-PSD decomposition (right). Text-to-PSD leverages spatial in-context learning with hierarchical captions, while Image-to-PSD performs iterative flow-guided foreground extraction and background restoration. Our method produces fully editable PSD layers with transparent alpha channels.",
