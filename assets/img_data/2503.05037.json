Document pairs are designed for controlled experiments shown in Table1. Positive values indicate a retriever‚Äôs preference for the more biased document in each bias scenario, while for answer importance, they reflect a preference for answer-containing documents. The results show that retrieval biases often outweigh the impact of answer presence.",

Repetition Bias shows that repeating an entity multiple times increases its score. Lastly, Answer Importance demonstrates that the query‚Äôs answer entity receives less attention compared to head entity matches.",
