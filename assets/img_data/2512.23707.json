We obtain rewards for RL by using the initial model to grade generated plans with the help of rubrics.(Left)To collect training data, we use asample creatormodel (Llama-4-Maverick) to extract up to three samples per research paper, each including a research goal, goal-specific grading rubric, and reference solution. For each of these components, we provide guidelines to asample selectormodel (Claude-4-Sonnet) that picks one best sample per paper for our use.(Right)During grading, the goal-specific rubrics are used alongside a list of seven general guidelines that are checked for the part of the plan relevant to each rubric item. Rubric items that meet all guidelines are marked satisfied, and the fraction of satisfied rubric items is used as part of the training reward and evaluation scores.",
