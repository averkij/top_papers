In this sense, oscillation and resonance form a common computational\nsubstrate that simultaneously composes structure in the material world and\norganizes sound in the musical domain, providing a reversible and physically\nmeaningful bridge between the two. Across media, vibration imposes physical constraints that make mappings invertible.",
