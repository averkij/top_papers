Under a successful IPI attack, the untrusted span overtakes the user request in driving the model’s output (ΔS≫ΔU\\Delta_{S}\\gg\\Delta_{U}), exhibiting aDominance Shift. Detecting this signature allows the system to selectively intervene (Path B) by sanitizing the specific trigger and masking the reasoning history, while normal requests proceed without overhead (Path A).",
