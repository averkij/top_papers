(b) The Segmented Cross-Attention strategy has three variants: 1) Isolated Segmented Cross-Attention (ISCA) directly splits the hidden states along the temporal dimension. The output is concatenated by multiple segments’ output. 2) Sequential Segmented Cross-Attention (SSCA) where each segment will see all the previous text conditions. All the overlapped regions are averaged and concatenated with other regions. 3) Overlap Segmented Cross-Attention (OSCA) that is adopted in our method. Only frames at the segment boundary will cross-attend with multiple text conditions.",

Our Presto can capture intricate text details and generate long videos with long-range coherence and rich content.

For the second case, our generated videos are of the largest camera motion and the best scenario coherence.",
