Unlike other metrics, which exhibit a generic unimodal distribution, the entropy of initial thought tokens (𝐇init\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{init}}) displays a distinct bimodal and heavy-tailed distribution. This indicates that𝐇init\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{init}}serves as a discriminative signal, effectively capturing the “Aha Moments” that distinguish complex reasoning steps from routine derivations.",

At the onset of each reasoning step, the SLM first generates a “glimpse” (the initial tokenTkT_{k}). GlimpRouter then computes the entropy𝐇init\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{init}}of this token to gauge step difficulty. Based on the threshold, the system dynamically routes the generation: (1) Delegate (Low𝐇init\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{init}}): Routine steps are fully generated by the efficient SLM. (2) Intervene (High𝐇init\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{init}}): Complex steps signaling cognitive pivots are routed to the capable LLM for robust reasoning. Finally, the LLM generates the conclusive answer based on the aggregated collaborative chain.",
