The controller calls independently deploy vision tool services (e.g., Point, OCR), and their outputs are fed back to the LVLM for iterative reasoning.Bottom:Cold-Start initializes model via SFT on pre-generated trajectories. V-ToolRL employs K-turn rollouts where the model interacts with the tool environment to learn an adaptive policy, resulting in the final model.",

The results demonstrate the substantial performance gains achieved byV-ToolRLthrough its combined training stages and vision-integrated reinforcement learning.",
