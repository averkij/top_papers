Given static rigging features, a condition encoder produces anchor and global tokens that guide a diffusion transformer operating in RigMo’s motion-latent space. The model uses spatial, temporal, and frame-conditioned cross-attention to predict denoised motion latents, which are decoded into bone transformations and vertex sequences via Gaussian skinning.",

Given a sparse input sequence, where a subset of frames is observed according to a frame mask, RigMo reconstructs a complete animatable model by jointly predicting the rigging structure (Gaussian bones and skinning weights) and synthesizing the missing motion frames through diffusion in the RigMo latent space. The resulting rigged model produces coherent, articulated motion across humans, animals, and diverse non-human shapes, demonstrating that sparse observations are sufficient to recover a full animation without category-specific priors.",
