From each segment (um,iu_{m,i}), 16 frames (xm,ix_{m,i})\nare uniformly sampled to form a shorter segment, which is encoded by I3D (convolutional-based) and TimeSformer (transformer-based) encoders.\nThe concatenated andℓ2\\ell_{2}-normalized features are processed by a compact prediction head\nand aggregated through top-kkpooling to produce the final video-level anomaly prediction.",
