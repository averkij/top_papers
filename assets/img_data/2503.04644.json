The example simulates a legal case search, where the user provides detailed instructions to retrieve relevant legal cases. Current IR systems struggle to handle such complex queries. (Bottom left): As a result, users have to break down their information needs into simpler, iterative search queries and manually filter the retrieved cases, resulting in a time-consuming and inefficient process.\n(Bottom right): This study focuses on evaluating the progress and limitations of current end-to-end retrieval systems in expert-domain instruction-following IR.",
