Each participant was randomly allocated one of ten medical scenarios. The treatment groups conversed with an LLM to help assess the scenarios. The control group was permitted to use any method, with most participants using internet search or their own knowledge.(d)Participants then chose a disposition and identified medical conditions which motivated their choice. Participants completed two scenarios, until a total of 600 examples were collected for each experimental condition. We evaluated each participant’s responses using the gold standard answers.",
