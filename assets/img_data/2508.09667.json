Recent generative methods struggle with maintaining consistency between generated and input views. GSFixer guides the video diffusion model conditioned on both 3D and 2D signals to enhance consistency in novel view restoration, thereby improving 3D reconstruction quality.",

These novel views are fed into reference-guided video restoration model to correct artifacts, and the fixed novel views are then distilled back into the 3DGS representation to improve its quality. The restoration network is finetuned from CogVideoX and trained on paired artifact-ridden 3DGS renders and ground truth frames. It is additionally conditioned on 3D geometric tokens and 2D semantic tokens extracted from the reference views using pretrained VGGT and DINOv2 encoder, respectively.",
