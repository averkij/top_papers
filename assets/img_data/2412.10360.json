The light blue shaded areas represent the difference in accuracy between video and text inputs, highlighting the extent to which video perception enhances performance over text comprehension alone. The yellow shaded areas indicate the difference between video and image inputs, quantifying the additional benefit of temporal information from videos compared to static images.(Right)The correlation matrix shows the redundancy among benchmarks by illustrating the correlation coefficients between model performances on different benchmarks. Each cell in the matrix represents how closely the two benchmarks are related in terms of model performance. Our proposed benchmark, ApolloBench, is highly correlated with all tested benchmarks, suggesting that it offers an equally effective evaluation while being more computationally efficient.",
