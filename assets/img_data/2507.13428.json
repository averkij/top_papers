For Key Standards, we define specific physical phenomena as ground truth and measure if all of these phenomena the generated video satisfies. Both lead to either a score of “0” or “1” for a generated video. Red circles and yellow lines in the figure highlight instances where the generated videos fail to meet the Key Standards.",
