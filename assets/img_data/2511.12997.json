TheCondenserconverts raw navigation histories into standardized summaries stored inEMS, from which theCoachretrieves relevant prior experiences to provide task-specific guidance to the main web agent. This design enables long-term planning, reflection, and continual improvement across browsing sessions.",

Our limited compute supports running 5 tasks in parallel, and once a task finishes earlier than the others in a batch, we immediately start another task from the wait list instead of waiting for the entire batch to finish. This asynchronous queueing strategy reduces total evaluation time by over 80%, enabling scalable benchmarking of web agents at large scale.",
