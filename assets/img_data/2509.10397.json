Using GPT-4.1, we set up a user profile: a 30-year-old male interested in deep sea fishing and has a history of liking UFC events. The RecSys serves him five short videos (see 1st column). For each, the simulator performs three tasks: “Reasoning” (2nd column), predicts the “Action Taken” (3rd column), and updates the “Mindset” (4th column). The simulator successfully recognizes that “Lobster Fishing” matches his fishing interest, so he watches for 20 seconds. When “UFC Fight Night” appears, his past engagement suggests he’ll watch for 30 seconds. He isn’t interested in hairstyling, and when a second hairstyling video is shown (last row), the simulator notes, “Not interested, expected fewer recommendations.” This example shows that large reasoning models, such as GPT-4.1, hold significant potential for modeling user mindset.",
