Here, ‘M’ represents[𝙼𝙰𝚂𝙺]\\mathtt{[MASK]}tokens and ‘Resa.’ denotes resampling. SMC maintains multiple diffusion processes, calledparticles, to explore the sampling trajectories in parallel. At each iteration, we take three steps:resample,propagate, andre-weight, to perform as an interactive optimization process. Importantly, traditional diffusion sampling only considers token-level confidence, while our algorithm uses the trajectory-level confidence as importance weights, calculated using Eq. (13), to select globally confident outputs.",

We report the accuracy of LLaDA-1.5 and Dream-7B on MBPP and MATH datasets as the temperature varies uniformly from 0.0 to 1.0. The blue circles represent the baseline with standard parallel decoding, while the red stars denote the results using our SR-SMC withN=4N=4particles. SR-SMC consistently demonstrates better robustness across the entire temperature range. Notably, while the baseline performance of Dream-7B collapses at low temperatures (startig from 0.1) due to repetition, SR-SMC maintains stable and high accuracy by effectively exploring the generative space through particle re-weighting and resampling.",
