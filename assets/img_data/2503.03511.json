A Residual Feature Enhancement module is proposed to enhance the model attention on foreground objects instead of irrelevant background information.\nThrough feature projection, we construct an occupancy-prior volume from residual features and a shape-prior volume from scene features.\nThese volumes are then separately combined with their corresponding multi-view features using View Transformers. After fusion, a Ray Transformer further refines the spatial information. The final reconstructed geometry is represented as a signed distance function and converted into a radiance field.\nFinally, the grasping module maps the reconstructed geometry to 6-DoF grasp poses, enabling end-to-end training.",
