Each navigation episode is framed as a multi-turn dialogue, where the agent continually queries for the next actions. To support long-horizon reasoning while maintaining a manageable context size and low latency, we adopt a fixed-size sliding window to retain recent dialogue history. The context in inactive windows is updated by token pruning to to reduce memory overhead.",
