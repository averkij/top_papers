End-to-end results use pass@3 metric to mitigate non-model-related failures (e.g., CAPTCHA, VM crashes). Pass@1 results are also shown in a different shade of blue.\nThe results demonstrate that Step-GUI-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing open-source and proprietary agents, even surpassing models with much larger parameter counts.",
