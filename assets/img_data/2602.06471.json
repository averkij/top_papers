We revisit the shape convention of Transformer by replacing the narrow-wide-narrow FFN with a hourglass FFN, composing stacks of wide-narrow-wide sub-MLPs connected by residuals. We observe that Hourglass FFNs achieve comparable performance to the conventional design up to 1B parameters. Here we also show a conventional variant trained based on OLMo-2 architecture. Only the non-embedding parameters are accounted for the FLOPs.",
