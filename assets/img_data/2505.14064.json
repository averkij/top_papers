Task 1: Anomaly localization: models predict bounding boxes identifying abnormal regions in brain MRI; ground truth annotations from two independent radiologists are shown. Task 2: Image captioning: models generate a brief diagnostic description from the MRI image. Task 3: Diagnostic reasoning: models predict the final diagnosis by integrating clinical history and image findings. NOVA establishes the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for rare anomaly localization, clinical description, and multimodal diagnostic reasoning in brain MRI.",
