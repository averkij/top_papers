Inspired by the MCP, our system can also be analogized to a personal computer system architecture, comprising: (1) a central host with a memory bank for centrally managing and coordinating the system, analogous to the main computer processing system; (2) multiple agent servers to organize tools, execute specific tasks, and interact with the external environment, analogous to auxiliary hardware assistant equipment; (3) comprehensive external data sources, representing a complete external rare-disease diagnostic environment, supporting the entire system by various medical reliable evidence, including medical knowledge and clinical cases.cThe flowchart of the main workflow of our system illustrates two primary stages, i.e., the information collection stage and the self-reflection diagnosis stage. In the former, the central host actively collects medical support information relevant to the patient. In the latter, the central host performs self-reflection on its diagnostic results. Steps involving the central host are highlighted in blue boxes within the flowchart.",
