Text tokens are omitted for simplicity. (a) A frame is randomly selected from the candidate-frame set to estimate a 3D scene point cloud𝒮\\mathcal{S}. Using the estimated camera poses together with𝒮\\mathcal{S}, we then generate view-specific scene point cloud sequences for both the target and preceding clips. (b) The most spatially relevant frames are then retrieved from the candidate-frame set as reference frames. (c) The spatial conditions obtained from (a) and (b) guide the video generation process.

At the first iteration, the user provides an initial image, from which Spatia estimates the initial 3D scene point cloud. The user then specifies a text instruction and a camera path based on the estimated scene, producing a projection video along the desired trajectory that conditions the generation of clip-1.\nIn subsequent iterations, two steps are performed: (1) Spatia updates the spatial memory (3D scene point cloud) using all previously generated frames via MapAnything[keetha2025mapanything]; and (2) the user specifies a new text instruction and camera path based on the updated scene. Spatia then takes the reference frames (generated as described in Section3.1.2), the previously generated clip, and the new projection video as input to produce the next video clip.Text instructions are omitted.",
