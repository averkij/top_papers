Note that the points in these plots represent all models benchmarked in Table1, however, to make the plots more readable, we only visualize the dominating points in each case. The measured increases in HV Gain when AIM is applied can be clearly seen in the Pareto frontier shifting further forward when AIM is applied compared to when only a population of merged models is evaluated.",

This figure plots the relative change in HV Gain compared to scenarios without relaxation. The x-axis represents1−ω1𝜔1-\\omega1 - italic_ω, reflecting that decreasingω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ωresults in more aggressive relaxation. The plot indicates that for some tasks, such as Arithmetic and DARE, smaller values ofω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ωcontinue to yield benefits. Overall,ω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ωsettings of 0.4 or 0.6 appear to strike a good balance across various methods.",
