The Semantic Planner receives multimodal inputs, including a descriptive text prompt for static scene content (𝒯img\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{img}}), a motion description (𝒯motion\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{motion}}), an instructional system prompt (𝒯sys\\mathcal{T}_{\\text{sys}}) specifying the number of target framesTT, and optionally the semantically encoded first frameI0I_{0}.\nIt then autoregressively generates discrete text-aligned semantic tokens that encode spatio-temporal semantic structures in the form of keyframes.\nComplementary to global text conditioning, we introduce a dedicated semantic guidance branch that instructs a pretrained DiT model to translate these structured semantics augmented with 3D spatio-temporal RoPE into high-fidelity, temporally coherent video realizations.",

In contrast, baseline methods frequently deviate from the instruction, exhibiting visual hallucination (SkyReelsV2, HunyuanVideo), interacting with misaligned objects or incorrect spatial locations (Seedance, Wan2.2), or producing severe object misplacement (Wan2.2, Wan2.2-SFT, Kling). Ablated variants that replace our semantic planner with text-based prompt enhancement or query-based conditioning also suffer from prompt misalignment.",
