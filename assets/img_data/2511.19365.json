In (a), traditional baseline models rely on a single DiT to jointly model both low-frequency semantics and high-frequency signals. (b) shows our DeCo framework, where a lightweight pixel decoder focuses on the high-frequency reconstruction, and the DiT models low-frequency semantics. As shown in (c), decoupling DiT from modeling high-frequency signals leads to better low-frequency semantic features in DiT Output, and higher image quality.",
