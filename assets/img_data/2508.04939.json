The pipeline ensures direct comparison between hedged and confident responses to identical questions under controlled conditions. This setup enables precise attribution of outcome differences to linguistic style rather than content, revealing consistent penalization of hedged language across models.",

The pipeline begins with curated interview question selection, followed by baseline response creation. Linguistic variations—such as hedging—are systematically introduced while preserving semantic equivalence. All response pairs undergo manual validation to ensure informational parity. Each response is then scored by an LLM, which produces both a rating and a rationale. This controlled setup enables precise attribution of outcome differences to linguistic style, facilitating rigorous measurement of bias against specific sociolinguistic features.",
