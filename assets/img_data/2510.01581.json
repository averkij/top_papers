Given a problem, the model first generatesNNrollouts, and the pass rate of these rollouts is used to estimate the problemâ€™s difficulty (easy, medium, or hard). Next, the generated reasoning is fed back into the model, which is asked to compute the attention score of each reasoning token from</think>. During this attention-based compression step, we remove steps with lower scores. The degree of removal is determined by the estimated difficulty: easier problems undergo more aggressive compression. Finally, we compute the correctness and length rewards using the compressed reasoning trajectory, and these rewards are used to update the policy.",
