The model consists of a ViT visual encoder, a projector with token merging, and a hybrid Mamba-Transformer LLM equipped with TransV. The token merging[bolya2022tokenmerge]compresses each frame into 16 vision tokens. Inside the LLM, TransV transfers information from redundant vision tokens to instruction tokens to reduce the number of vision tokens. Specifically, TransV uniformly drops vision tokens in shallow layers and removes low-attention vision tokens in deeper layers. The compression module is implemented through a Gated Cross-Attention mechanism[alayrac2022flamingo]with adaptive learnable weights. Note that TransV is illustrated before the attention layer for clarity, though it may be applied before any layer in practice.",
