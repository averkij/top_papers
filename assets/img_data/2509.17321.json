While two-shot prompting generally improved VOC scores, many remained weak (approximately 0.1–0.3), with only a minority achieving moderate performance (≥\\geq0.4) and very few reaching strong performance levels (≥\\geq0.7). This suggests that these tasks remain challenging overall, and while few-shot prompting provides some benefit, it is often insufficient on its own to achieve robust performance.",
