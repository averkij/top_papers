The issue of hallucination has raised major concerns\nin the NLP community regarding their reliability and appli-\ncability [Rawte et al., 2023]. While various methods have\nbeen proposed to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs [Dhuli-\nawala et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2023], a novel perspective sug-",

The scores represent the average across five datasets used in this work (see 5.1). With the exception of ChemLLM, all other LLMs achieve scores below 10%, indicating high level of hallucination when generating natural language descriptions of molecules. gests that hallucinations may contribute to fostering creativity [Lee, 2023; Wang, 2024]. As creativity extends beyond merely retrieving information to include recombining and expanding existing knowledge, it closely resembles hallucination [Ye et al., 2023]. This creativity is vital in drug discovery, where exploring vast chemical spaces and devising innovative solutions to complex biological challenges are indispensable. The process of drug discovery involves evaluating vast number of potential drugs and requires long-term experimental trials, making it highly time-consuming and expensive [Gaudelet et al., 2021]. Prior work has leveraged machine learning to assist with this process [Rifaioglu et al., 2018; Mak et al., 2024], and generative models have also been utilized to facilitate drug discovery [Chakraborty et al., 2023; Murakumo et al., 2023]. Additionally, researchers have discovered that textual descriptions in chemistry can improve models generalization ability [Liu et al., 2023]. As discovering new drugs requires domain-specific knowledge and the creativity to identify new patterns, hallucination becomes potential strength for discovering molecules with high-level functions and abstract properties [Edwards et al., 2024a]. Researchers have started exploring the potential of LLMs Figure 2: Illustration of the evaluation method with an example molecule from the HIV dataset: 1. We use LLMs to generate textual description of the molecule based on its SMILES string. 2. The generated text, which contains hallucinations, is added to the prompt, and the LLM is tasked with predicting the specific property of the molecule. The answer is constrained to Yes or No to evaluate the LLMs performance. We highlight obvious hallucinations that are unrelated to the input using colors. for tasks such as drug generation [Pal et al., 2023]. Edwards et al. [2022, 2024b] used language models to generate descriptions of molecules as first step toward leveraging AI for higher-level control over molecule design, studying the connection between molecules and natural language. While this approach helps researchers study and understand molecular structures through natural language, LLMs without domainspecific fine-tuning often generate text with hallucinations. As shown in Figure 1, we use LLMs to generate descriptions of molecules and compare them with reference descriptions generated by the domain-specific model MolT5 [Edwards et al., 2022]. The factual consistency is notably low, indicating that LLMs hallucinate extensively. However, these hallucinated descriptions may still provide valuable insights that help LLMs differentiate between molecules and support drug discovery. For instance, they might include high-level descriptions of the molecule, potential applications of the compounds, and other relevant information. We acknowledge that the exploration of leveraging hallucination, rather than mitigating it, remains unexplored. Thus, we propose the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. As LLMs are sensitive to prompts, subtle change can result in entirely different outputs [Sclar et al., 2024]. Regarding the connections between language and molecules, we assume that the prompt text is of paramount importance for LLMs performance in drug discovery. To verify our hypothesis and investigate the effects of hallucinations on LLMs in drug discovery, we design comprehensive experiments that involve modifying the prompt formatting and input to the LLMs. As shown in Figure 2, we first use LLMs to generate textual descriptions of molecules based on their SMILES al., 2024], Falcon3-Mamba-7B [Zuo Ministral-8B et strings [Weininger, 1988]. We then add the text descriptions, along with the SMILES strings of molecules, to the models input and provide task-specific instructions to predict whether molecule possesses specific function, such as antiviral properties or toxicity, depending on the dataset. For comparison, we use MolT5 to translate molecules into natural language [Edwards et al., 2022] as the reference description. In our study, we evaluate seven instructiontuned LLMs: Llama-3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B [Dubey et [MistralAI, al., 2024], 2024], ChemLLM-7B [Zhang et al., 2024a], GPT-3.5, and GPT-4o [Achiam et al., 2023]. The results confirm our hypothesis and show that LLM-generated hallucinations can improve models for drug discovery tasks. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the SMILES baseline and 13.79% gain compared to the MolT5 baseline. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the greatest average improvement across models. We also investigate additional factors that potentially affect hallucination and model performance, namely model size, generation temperature, and the language of the LLM-generated hallucinations. While generation temperature has minimal impact on the observed improvements, model size plays significant role, with larger models demonstrate greater potential for improvement with hallucinations. Additionally, generating hallucinations in other languages reveals that hallucinations in Chinese yield the most significant improvement compared to five other languages. Last but no least, we conduct case study to analyze why hallucinated text improves LLMs by examining attention scores. Our findings reveal that hallucinations contain unrelated yet faithful information, such as suggestions for the molecules potential usage, which may inadvertently assist LLMs in making predictions. In summary, our contributions are threefold: We conduct the first systematic investigation into how hallucinations affect LLMs in drug discovery, providing valuable insights for future research on harnessing LLMs for pharmaceutical innovation. By evaluating seven instruction-tuned LLMs, we validate the hypothesis that hallucinations can enhance LLM performance in drug discovery tasks. Through empirical experiments and case study, we examine the factors that influence hallucinations, assess their impact on performance, and uncover the reasons behind this phenomenon."

However, with growing attention on the creativity of artificial intelligence [Lee, 2022; Zhao et al., 2024], investigating creativity in LLMs has also captured public interest [Chen and Ding, 2023]. Lu et al. [2024] proposed framework to enhance the creativity of LLMs, while Gomez-RodrÄ±guez and Williams [2023] evaluated the creative writing capabilities of LLMs. Franceschelli and Musolesi [2024] explored the creativity of LLMs and analyzed their societal impact on the creative industries. At the same time, hallucination has been regarded as form of creativity in LLMs as Jiang et al. [2024] considered hallucination not merely as negative phenomenon but also as potential driver of creativity. They examined the interplay between hallucination and creativity through cognitive science and neuroscience perspectives. For instance, Alexander Flemings accidental discovery of penicillin exemplifies how unintended outcomes can lead to groundbreaking innovations. This illustrates how both factual and faithfulness hallucinations can play pivotal role in fostering creativity. Additionally, mathematical analysis reviewed the relationship between hallucination and creativity in LLMs based on probability and information theory [Lee, 2023]. Building on the established connection between hallucination and creativity, we are the first to explore the impact of hallucinations on LLMs in drug discovery."

MolT5 is pre-trained and fine-tuned model leveraging extensive molecule-text pairs. We consider the text generated by MolT5 as the reference description. As shown in Figure 1, the descriptions generated by most LLMs exhibit low factual consistency compared with the references produced by MolT5. Even for ChemLLM, which is pre-trained with extensive chemical knowledge, achieves score of 20.89%. Other models display average scores ranging from 7.42% to 13.58%, indicating that LLMs generate significant hallucinations when translating SMILES strings into natural language.

Tox21 measures the toxicity of compounds on 12 different targets. Data Split We follow the split strategies outlined by Wu et al. [2018] to divide the datasets. HIV and BBBP are split using scaffold splitting, which partitions the samples based on their two-dimensional structures [Bemis and Murcko, 1996]. Clintox, SIDER, and Tox21 are split randomly.

For SIDER, we test whether the molecule causes the side effect of reproductive system and breast disorders.

Similarly, compared to the baseline Gold, all LLMs except GPT-3.5 perform better with hallucinations than with the gold reference provided as input. Among all the LLMs, Llama-3.1-8B demonstrates the highest improvement when using hallucinations generated by GPT-3.5, achieving 18.35% better performance than the SMILES baseline and 13.79% better than the Gold baseline. Additionally, Falcon3-Mamba-7B also surpasses the baselines by nearly 10%. From these results, we conclude that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. The category of the LLM does not play significant role, as domain-specific models like ChemLLM also benefit from hallucinations. Which LLM Generates the Most Beneficial Hallucinations for Drug Discovery? We further investigate which LLM-generated hallucinations bring the greatest benefits to LLMs in drug discovery. Figure 3 shows the average improvement across all the LLMs we used when leveraging hallucinations generated by different models. The model names denote the sources of the hallucinations. We can see that hallucinations generated by OpenAI models provide the most significant improvements. In particular, hallucinations from GPT-4o increase model performance by an average of 4.07% and 4.54% compared to the SMILES and MolT5 baselines, respectively. Similarly, hallucinations generated by GPT-3.5 yield average performance Figure 3: Overall average improvement across seven LLMs using hallucinations generated by different models compared to the baselines. The x-axis indicates the source model for the generated hallucinations. gains of 1.6% and 2.08%. Additionally, text generated by Llama-3 and Ministral improves model performance by approximately 1%. However, hallucinations generated by Falcon3-Mamba and Llama-3.1 lead to performance drops of -1.65% and -0.31%, respectively, compared to the SMILES baseline. Overall, while hallucinations generated by most LLMs can improve the performance of LLMs in drug discovery, GPT-4o delivers the most significant improvements."

We use Llama-3.1-8B to generate molecule descriptions under different temperature settings: {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}. First, we evaluate the generated text using the hallucination score. As illustrated by the line chart in Figure 5, the average hallucination score across the five datasets shows clear trend: higher temperatures result in lower factual consistency and, consequently, higher hallucination. The models performance across different temperatures reveals general pattern where higher hallucination scores correlate with worse performance. However, there is an exception at temperature of 0.3, where the model does not perform as well compared to the temperature 0.5 and 0.7. Despite these variations, the overall performance with different temperatures does not differ significantly, ranging from 54.20% at temperature of 0.9 to 57.10% at 0.1. This may be due to the relatively small differences in hallucination scores across temperatures. As shown in Table 1, without LLM-generated hallucinations, Llama-3.1-8B achieves only 41.71% and 46.28% average ROC-AUC for the SMILES and MolT5 baselines, respectively.

            "title": "9 Conclusion\nIn this work, we investigate whether hallucination can help\nLLMs in drug discovery. Coming up with the hypothesis that\nhallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery, we eval-\nuate seven LLMs across five drug discovery datasets by incor-\nporating LLM-generated hallucinations into the prompt. The\nexperimental results confirm our hypothesis: hallucinations\nenhance the performance of LLMs compared to when no hal-\nlucination is provided. Nearly all the evaluated LLMs demon-\nstrate better performance with hallucinations compared to\nwithout them.",
            "content": "We further explore factors that may influence hallucinations and the performance of LLMs. As model size increases, the improvement in LLM performance with the same hallucination shows general trend of growth. While generation temperature impacts the hallucination score, it has minimal effect on the models performance. Most notably, hallucinations in Chinese yield the highest average improvement for Llama-3.1-8B, despite Chinese not being pre-trained language for the model. Meanwhile, we conduct case study to investigate why text containing hallucinations can enhance LLM performance. We hypothesize that unrelated yet faithful information may contribute to this improvement. Our work provides new perspective on leveraging hallucinations for LLMs and highlights their potential for fostering creativity in AI. Future research could build on these findings to further investigate the effects of hallucinations and explore the underlying mechanisms in depth. Figure 6: Performance of hallucinations in six languages across all datasets using Llama-3.1-8B. Chinese achieves the highest average ROC-AUC score of 57.81%, which is surprising given that it is not included in the pretrained language list [Dubey et al., 2024]. French and English follow closely with average ROC-AUC scores of 56.21% and 55.88%, respectively. German and Spanish show moderate performance, while Japanese has the lowest average score. Upon reviewing the generated text in Chinese, we observed that much of it is written in Pinyin, romanization system for Standard Chinese, and includes extensive English explanations, which may contribute to the higher performance. Individual datasets show varying preferences for specific languages. HIV and BBBP achieve the best performance with English, while Clintox performs best with French. SIDER achieves its highest performance with German, and Tox21 yields the best results with Spanish. In summary, the language of hallucination significantly impacts model performance. While pretrained languages generally perform well, the surprising performance of Chinese highlights the potential of LLMs to leverage unseen languages effectively."

Name SMILES Reference tion English Chinese German French Japanese Spanish Description N#Cc1ccccc1O descripThe molecule is nitrile that is hydrogen cyanide in which the hydrogen has been replaced by hydroxy group. It has role as an EC 1.2.1.3 [aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(+))] inhibitor. It is nitrile and member of phenols. It derives from hydride of pyridine. The given molecular formula is N#Cc1ccccc1O. This formula represents molecule of benzenecarbonitrile, also known as benzonitrile. The molecule consists of benzene ring, which is planar, ring-shaped structure composed of six carbon atoms, each bonded to hydrogen atom. In this case, one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring is bonded to nitrile group (CN), which consists of carbon atom triple-bonded to nitrogen atom. Additionally, the molecule has an oxygen atom bonded to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring, making it benzonitrile derivative with an alkoxy group (-O-). To describe the molecule in Chinese, we first need to identify the chemical structure. The given chemical formula is N#Cc1ccccc1O. Breaking it down: - represents Nitrogen. - # represents triple bond. - represents Carbon. - c1 represents ring (benzene ring). - ccc represents three connected carbons. - 1 is the number of the ring. - represents Oxygen. So, the molecule is Benzotriazole molecule. In Chinese, it is written as: è¯ä¸å Die Molekulformel in deutscher Sprache ist: N-(Phenyl)-acetohydrazid Die Molekulstruktur ist ein Hydrazid, das aus einem Acetohydrazid-Molekul und einem Phenyl-Rest besteht. Der Name N-(Phenyl)-acetohydrazid beschreibt die Struktur des Molekuls, wobei das Acetohydrazid-Molekul an das Phenyl-Rest gebunden ist. Eine alternative Bezeichnung fur dieses Molekul acetohydrazid ist eine allgemein akzeptierte und einfache Bezeichnung. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die Molekulformel N#Cc1ccccc1O eine SMILES-Notation ist, eine kurze Bezeichnung fur Molekule, die in der Chemie verwendet wird. Diese Notation kann jedoch nicht direkt als Name eines Molekuls verwendet werden. ist 1-Hydroxy-2-phenyl-2-hydrazinethanon, aber N-(Phenyl)- La molecule decrite par la formule chimique N#Cc1ccccc1O est un isocyanure, plus precisement un isocyanure aromatique. Dans la nomenclature chimique, la formule peut Ëetre decomposee comme suit : - represente un atome dazote. - Le # indique un pont triple entre lazote et le carbone suivant. - represente des atomes de carbone. - Les entre les atomes de carbone indiquent des liaisons entre eux. - Le chiffre 1 entre les parenth`eses indique un cycle (un anneau) compose de 6 atomes de carbone. - represente un atome doxyg`ene. La molecule decrite est donc un isocyanure aromatique cetogenique, qui peut Ëetre nomme isocyanure benz`ene ou isocyanure cetogenique benzenique . Cependant, il est important de noter que la formule chimique donnee peut egalement correspondre `a The molecule you provided is 3-Quinuclidinone. In Japanese, the name of this molecule is 3-ã­ãã­ã¸ã³ãªãã¦ã  (3-Kinukijinoniu), but this is not entirely accurate, as the molecule is not an ion, but rather ketone. more accurate Japanese name for this molecule would be 3-ã­ãã­ã¸ãã³ (3-Kinukijinon). Heres breakdown of the name: - 3-: indicates the position of the carbonyl group - ã­ãã­ã¸ - (Kinukiji-): refers to the quinuclidine ring - ãã³ (Non): indicates the presence of carbonyl group (ketone) So, the correct Japanese name for the molecule N#Cc1ccccc1O is 3-ã­ãã­ã¸ãã³ (3-Kinukijinon). La molecula descrita es un anillo aromatico de benzeno (C6H6) con un grupo aminocloruro sustituido (NHCl) un grupo hidroxilo (OH) sustituido en el anillo. Sin embargo, considerando la notacion SMILES proporcionada (N#Cc1ccccc1O), es mas probable que la molecula sea una anilina (C6H5NH2) con un grupo hidroxilo (OH) sustituido en el anillo. La estructura quÄ±mica serÄ±a: C1=CC=C(C=C1)N=O. Table 11: Example of molecule and descriptions in different languages generated by Llama-3.1-8B."
