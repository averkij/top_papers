Introduction Large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Comanici et al., 2025) have demonstrated exceptional performance across wide range of natural lan- *Equal contribution IL, USA 2Caltech Pasadena, CA, USA.

Existing research seeks to bridge this gap primarily through pre-training (Gupta et al., 2023; Hwang et al., 2025) or post-training (Schulman et al., 2017; Rafailov et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2025), which are often inflexible and expensive for scenarios requiring rapid adaptation with limited data, such as enabling LLM agents to adapt to novel tasks in changing environments at deployment time (Chen et al., 2026). As result, several inference-stage methods have been proposed to adapt LLMs (Dong et al., 2024; Brown et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020), including context engineering, test-time training, and activation space steering. Context engineering (Dong et al., 2024; Brown et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020) is flexible but remains brittle over even small content variations or format changes (Sclar et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024b). Test-Time Training aims to dynamically update model weights during inference stage but it introduces computational latency and degradation of base capability (Wang et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2025; Agarwal et al., 2025; Yuksekgonul et al., 2026). In contrast, activation steering, which directly injects vector into models activation space, provides another direct intervention for controlling LLM behavior without manipulating model parameters (Turner et al., 2023; Rimsky et al., 2023). As illustrated in Figure 1, existing steering methods largely fall into two paradigms. Task-vector steering learns steering directions directly from downstream data, achieving strong task-specific gains but incurring high computational cost and poor generalization across tasks, even within the same domain (Sinii et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025b; Jiang et al., 2025b). Semantic-driven steering, in contrast, constructs concept vectors from contrastive templates to enable efficient and interpretable control over high-level attributes (e.g., honesty or tone) (Turner et al., 2023; Konen et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024). Despite their differences, both 1 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs Figure 1. Comparison of Task-Vector Steering, Semantic-Driven Vector Steering, and STEER2ADAPT. (a) Task-Vector Steering derives task vectors through large-scale data training; while effective, this approach is computationally intensive and lacks semantic interpretability. (b) Concept-Vector Steering utilizes pre-defined semantic concept vectors, which often lack the necessary expressiveness for complex downstream tasks. (c) STEER2ADAPT (ours) employs Bayesian Optimization with minimal examples to find an optimal linear combination of concept vectors, achieving high performance while remaining data-efficient and semantically transparent. paradigms rely on identifying single static steering direction from scratch for each task or concept. This formulation is inherently limited: (1) vector optimized for one task can be ineffective or even harmful to others, even within the same domain (Rimsky et al., 2023; Siu et al., 2025a). (2) Moreover, many real-world tasks require coordinated control over multiple capabilities (Zhong et al., 2024a), which cannot be flexibly captured by single direction. These limitations cannot be resolved by merely refining individual steering vectors. Instead, they necessitate framework that can flexibly compose existing steering vectors to support diverse and multifaceted task requirements, while remaining data-efficient and generalizable across tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose STEER2ADAPT, framework that shifts the focus of activation steering from finding direction to systematic recipe. Our core insight is that tasks within specific domain (e.g., Safety or Reasoning) often share common set of underlying behavioral dimensions (Siu et al., 2025a; Bai et al., 2025). Rather than deriving new vector for every task shift, STEER2ADAPT spans these dimensions into reusable, low-dimensional semantic concept subspace. Under this formulation, adapting to new task amounts to dynamically searching recipe linear combination of basis vectors. This can be done using only handful of examples. As result, STEER2ADAPT enables data-efficient, stable, and transparent inferencetime adaptation across diverse tasks within domain. Specifically, for given domain, STEER2ADAPT first constructs prior semantic subspace using dimensions extracted via representation engineering (Zou et al., 2023). Then, using only few examples, we employ Bayesian optimization with novel stability-aware objective that rewards correcting previously incorrect decisions while penalizing flips from correct to incorrect, enabling search for effective steering vectors that can control models behaviors. At inference time, these coefficients are applied to the basis vectors to produce composite steering vector, which is injected into the models activation space. To evaluate the efficacy of STEER2ADAPT, we conduct extensive experiments across nine diverse tasks spanning the Reasoning and Safety domains. Our results demonstrate that STEER2ADAPT consistently facilitates effective inference-stage adaptation, achieving substantial performance gains with an average 8.2% improvement across 3 models. Our contributions are threefold: shift toward compositional steering: We position steering-based adaptation as discovering compact steering recipe that repurposes and composes small set of reusable semantic concept vectors, instead of learning new task-specific direction from scratch. lightweight steering adaptation framework: We propose STEER2ADAPT, which uses Bayesian optimization with stability-aware objective to search subspace coefficients from only handful of examples, synthesizes composed steering vector, and injects it at inference time to adapt LLMs for new tasks. Systematic analysis and reusable domain subspaces: Through extensive experiments in reasoning and safety, we systematically study composed activation steering performance. We further instantiate the framework with two reusable semantic subspaces, where small set of domain-level basis vectors supports diverse tasks. 2. Related Works Large Language Model Adaptation. Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) generally involves three stages: pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference-stage adaptation. 2 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs While pre-training and fine-tuning serve to build foundational knowledge and task-specific alignment (Ouyang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024a), inference-stage adaptation seeks to adjust LLMs for novel tasks without prohibitive re-training costs (Dong et al., 2024). Current literature primarily explores several directions. First, context-based augmentation leverages the in-context learning (ICL) and fewshot capabilities of LLMs (Brown et al., 2020), integrating external knowledge (Lewis et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2025) or past experience (Zhong et al., 2024c; Ouyang et al., 2025). Second, Test-Time Training (TTT) introduces dynamic parameter updates during inference (Wang et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024; Karmanov et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025). Our work focuses on activation steering, which identifies latent conceptual representations within the hidden space and manipulates model behavior via inference-time interventions without updating model parameters. This paradigm is generally categorized into taskvector steering and semantic-driven steering. The former utilizes annotated downstream data to learn steering signals (Wu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a; Konen et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025c); while effective for complex behaviors, it is often constrained by the requirement for large-scale, highquality annotations. Conversely, semantic-driven methods rely on synthetic contrasting pairs derived from conceptual semantics (Rimsky et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a), offering flexibility at the cost of potential misalignment with specific downstream tasks. Unlike prior work that optimizes single concept representation, we study how to compose multiple existing concept vectors and exploit their complementary effects. We posit that tasks within domain are shaped by shared set of domainrelevant concepts, and investigate systematic framework to learn task-specific recipe (combination weights) over these vectors for tasks, such as reasoning and safety. Composition in LLM Adaptation. For domain adaptation in LLMs, the composition of LLMs offers promising direction (Feng et al., 2025), either by statically fusing parameters or by dynamically selecting computation conditioned on the input. Model merging represents static approach that blends weights from multiple specialized model weights into single checkpoint without additional training (Wortsman et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2024; Goddard et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Dang et al., 2025). Typically, existing methods address parameter interference by treating fine-tuned weights as vectors via task arithmetic (Ilharco et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a). In contrast, Mixture of Experts (MoE) achieves composition dynamically (Masoudnia & Ebrahimpour, 2014); instead of fusing weights, it maintains distinct experts and employs routing mechanism to select sparse subset of parameters for each input (Zhou et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2024). This allows MoE to scale capacity while maintaining constant inference costs, albeit at the expense of larger memory (Mu & Lin, 2025; Cai et al., 2025). In contrast, our work does not focus on merging discrete model components to enable multi-tasking in the parameter space. Instead, we explore the composition of domain-relevant activation vectors to synthesize new vector that enhances model performance on novel tasks within the same domain. 3. Methodology 3.1. Task Formulation Consider language model fθ : Y, task domain D, and specific task D. We hypothesize that performance on domain is governed by underlying behavioral concept dimensions {c1, . . . , ck}. For each concept ci, we identify steering vector vi Rd that represents the direction in activation space corresponding to that concept. Given specific task and only few examples from it, our objective is to search for optimal coefficients α = (α1, . . . , αk) Rk such that the combined steering vector vcombined = (cid:80)k i=1 αivi applied to the models activations improves performance on task . For example, in the reasoning domain, we identify five important behavioral concepts based on Big Five personality traits (e.g., openness, conscientiousness, etc). For new reasoning task, such as the coding task, we aim to search for combination of them to improve coding performance. 3.2. STEER2ADAPT We introduce STEER2ADAPT as shown in Figure 1, which (i) operates over pre-defined semantic subspace spanned by set of behavioral concept vectors (e.g., extraversion) for given domain (Section 3.2.1), (ii) employs Bayesian Optimization with stability-aware objective to efficiently explore steering directions within the low-dimensional semantic subspace using only few task examples (Section 3.2.2), and (iii) composes the learned coefficients into the final steering vector and injects it during inference. 3.2.1. PRIOR SEMANTIC SUBSPACE CONSTRUCTION Rather than learning task-specific steering vectors from scratch, we leverage domain knowledge to construct reusable semantic subspace that serves as prior for adaptation. For given task domain D, we identify important behavioral concept dimensions {c1, . . . , ck} and extract their corresponding steering vectors {v1, . . . , vk} from the models activation space using Representation Engineering (Zou et al., 2023). These vectors form concept dictionary = [v1, . . . , vk] Rdk, which spans frozen seman3 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs Figure 2. STEER2ADAPT Overview. (1) Semantic prior subspace construction: based on humans insights, we define set of concepts that will affect model performance in domain and extract corresponding steering vectors to form semantic prior subspace within LLMs activation space. (2) Composed vector search: using only few task examples, we run Bayesian optimization over the subspace coefficients with stability-aware objective that rewards fixing wrong predictions while penalizing flips from correct to incorrect, yielding composed steering vector for inference-stage model steering. tic subspace = span(V). All steering interventions are constrained to this subspace via: = + Vα = + (cid:88) i=1 αivi (1) where α Rk are coefficients to be learned. This reduces adaptation from d-dimensional problem to searching over coefficients (k d). 3.2.2. COMPOSED VECTOR SEARCH Given the semantic subspace S, our goal is to find an effective coefficient vector α that improves task performance using only few examples. Prior work has shown that incontext learning and steering can be viewed as forms of Bayesian belief updating, where model behavior is refined using limited observations (Xie et al., 2021). Motivated by this perspective, we employ Bayesian Optimization to efficiently explore the low-dimensional coefficient space Rk, which is well-suited for sample-efficient black-box search when each evaluation is expensive. The challenge, however, lies in designing objectives that work reliably with limited samples. naive approach that maximizes accuracy on few-shot examples risks overfitting. To address this, we design strict stability-aware objective. We partition the support set into Berr (initially incorrect) and Bcorr (initially correct). Our objective maximizes improvement on errors while imposing hierarchical safety regularization Lreg on correct examples: J(α) = (cid:88) xBerr p(y x) (cid:88) xBcorr Lreg(x) (2) where the regularization enforces the penalty hierarchy: Lreg(x) = λflip Iflip(x) + λdrop Idrop(x) (3) 4 The first term in Eq. 2 is the adaptation gain. The second term Lreg strictly penalizes regression: Iflip activates on prediction flips (hard constraint), and Idrop activates on confidence degradation. We enforce λflip > λdrop Gain (see App. A.3), ensuring the optimization is risk-averse. The optimized coefficients α define composed steering vector = Vα, which is injected into the model only at inference time through activation addition. Importantly, this procedure requires no gradient updates. The same can be reused across inputs from the same target task, making the method plug-in intervention during inference. 4. Experiment Setup 4.1. Tasks and Datasets To comprehensively evaluate the adaptability of our steering framework, we conduct experiments across two distinct and important domains of tasks: Reasoning and Safety. These two domains are both central to real-world LLM adaptation, widely studied in prior work, and require complex, multi-faceted capabilities (Song et al., 2025). Reasoning Subspace and Tasks. We construct the reasoning subspace using the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), which capture behavioral variations relevant to LLM reasoning (Li et al., 2025b). We evaluate 5 reasoning domains: Code, Social, Arithmetic, Logic, and Game. Specifically, we use MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) for code generation, EWOK (Ivanova et al., 2025) for social reasoning, Simple Equations and Letter Counting from Reasoning Gym (Stojanovski et al., 2025) for arithmetic and game reasoning, and First Order Logic (Parmar et al., 2024) for logical reasoning.

Results are reported as absolute scores, with improvement ( blue ) and degradation ( red ) relative to direct inference. STEER2ADAPT achieves strong and consistent gains across most tasks and models, outperforming prompt-based baselines and alternative representation intervention methods. Safety Subspace and Tasks. Following prior work on safety (Siu et al., 2025a), we construct safety subspace along five semantic dimensions: Fairness, Sycophancy, Refusal, Hallucination, and Lawfulness. We evaluate safety performance on four benchmarks: SaladBench (Li et al., 2024b) for refusal, FaithfulQA (Jia et al., 2024) for sycophancy, TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) for hallucination, and BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) for bias. forward pass over the calibration data. In practice, constructing single steering vector takes under five minutes on single NVIDIA A6000 GPU for the models evaluated. This choice of using REP is intentionally lightweight and straightforward, and STEER2ADAPT is agnostic to the specific vector construction method; more sophisticated or learned steering vectors can be substituted without changing the framework. Additional details are in Appendix A.9. Steering Vector Construction. To construct semantic steering vectors, we adopt straightforward representation engineering (REP) approach, also known as control vectors (Zou et al., 2023; Vogel, 2024). For each basis concept, we specify semantically contrastive guidance (e.g., honest vs. dishonest) and combine them with set of small, taskagnostic contrasting templates to compute the steering direction. This procedure requires no task-specific data or training and can be implemented efficiently with single 4.2. Models and Baselines We evaluate three different open-source models from distinct families: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1. To ensure fair comparison under strict data constraints, all baselines use small, balanced calibration set of = 12 examples, constructed by balancing instances that the model answers correctly and incorrectly under direct inference. We evalu5 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs Figure 3.

Prompting methods include Few-Shot Prompting (n = 1, 2) and In-Context Learning (ICL). Few-shot demonstrations are drawn from the calibration set with uniformly distributed correct-answer positions. For ICL, we provide explicit task attributes and instructions; example prompts are provided in Appendix A.7. For representation engineering, we evaluate Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) (Rimsky et al., 2023), which computes static task vectors from positivenegative activation contrasts, and Single-Direction Steering (REP) baseline. For REP, we sweep fixed coefficients ({1, 0.5, 0.5, 1}) over each basis vector and select the best-performing vectorcoefficient pair on the calibration set. For all steering-based methods, steering vectors are injected at layers {8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24}. All methods are evaluated over five independent runs, reporting mean and standard deviation. Experiments are conducted on NVIDIA A6000 GPUs. Details in Bayesian optimization implementation can be found in Appendix A.4. 5. Experiment Results We evaluate STEER2ADAPT across both reasoning and safety subspaces, comparing it against the baselines. Table 1 reports detailed performance for individual method taskmodel combinations, while Figure 3 summarizes aggregated results at multiple levels, including task-level performance, cross-model generalization, and reliability. STEER2ADAPT Consistently Improves Performance Across Tasks. Figure 3 (a) and (d) shows task-level performance averaged across backbone models for both reasoning and safety. Across all evaluated tasks, STEER2ADAPT consistently yields positive performance improvements. it achieves the strongest average gains For reasoning, across all five domains, with particularly large improvements on Code and stable gains on Arithmetic, Logic, and Game tasks. For safety, STEER2ADAPT achieves the best performance on three out of four tasks and the second-best result on the remaining one, indicating strong task-level generalization. In contrast, baseline methods frequently exhibit task-dependent regressions and ineffectiveness. STEER2ADAPT Generalizes Reliably Across Backbone Models. Figure 3 (b) and (e) report performance averaged across tasks for each backbone model. STEER2ADAPT achieves the strongest or near-strongest improvements across all evaluated backbones in both domains. For reasoning, it consistently improves performance on Llama3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral-7B, while most baselines degrade performance on at least one model. For safety, STEER2ADAPT attains the best performance on two models and near-best result on the third, whereas methods that perform well on single model (e.g., few-shot prompting) often suffer severe regressions on others. These results demonstrate robust cross-model generalization. STEER2ADAPT Achieves Stable Gains With Low Variance. Figure 3 (c) and (f) show the distribution of per6 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs Figure 4. STEER2ADAPT depends on basis direction relevance and is robust to moderate subspace noise. (a) Steering reasoning with mismatched subspace (safety directions) causes large performance drops and higher variance. (b) Adding small number of less relevant directions to the reasoning subspace leads to only minor performance changes. (c) Task vectors from relevant tasks can form an effective steering subspace with performance comparable to semantic subspaces. formance changes across all evaluation scenarios. Across both reasoning and safety settings, STEER2ADAPT exhibits compact, positively centered gain distributions with no negative outliers. In contrast, baseline methods display substantially higher variance and frequent severe regressions, including drops exceeding 30% in some safety scenarios. This stability indicates that STEER2ADAPT delivers predictable and reliable improvements, which is particularly important for deployment. STEER2ADAPT Achieves Strong Gains with Low Inference Overhead. Beyond performance, practical deployment requires low inference overhead. Prompting-based methods incur higher cost due to long prompts and incontext examples, whereas steering approaches add minimal overhead. We quantify this trade-off using composite score that divides normalized performance improvement by inference cost. As shown in Figure 5, steeringbased methods outperform prompting under this metric, with STEER2ADAPT achieving the highest score. Figure 5. STEER2ADAPT achieves the best performance efficiency trade-off. We report an efficiency score that infermeasures the gain in task performance per unit of ence cost, computed as Efficiency = (Improvement Minimum Performance)/Inference Overhead. 7 6. Analysis In this section, we first study how the semantic prior subspace affects the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, focusing on subspace relevance and robustness, and then further examine the trade-off between domain adaptation performance gains from injecting steering vectors and the influence on models general natural language capability. Basis Directions Matter. Our method relies on steering model behavior along directions that are semantically relevant to the target domain, rather than arbitrary axes in the representation space. To examine the importance of direction relevance, we conduct an ablation in which safety-related subspace is used to steer reasoning tasks. As shown in Figure 4a, this mismatch leads to substantial performance degradation across all reasoning tasks. Moreover, the resulting performance exhibits significantly increased variance, indicating unstable behavior. These results demonstrate that effective steering requires meaningful vectors aligned with the target domain, and using unrelated directions can harm both performance and stability. STEER2ADAPT is tolerant to Imperfect Basis While meaningful directions are necessary, we further investigate whether the method is sensitive to moderate imperfections in the chosen subspace. Specifically, we augment the reasoning subspace with small number of additional directions that are weakly related or unrelated to reasoning, including vectors derived from safety tasks and generic optimistic direction. As shown in Figure 4b, introducing such less relevant directions results in only minor changes in average performance and variance. Compared to the severe degradation observed under strong semantic mismatch, the method remains largely stable in this setting. These results indicate that STEER2ADAPT does not require an exact or perfectly curated set of directions, and remains stable in the presence of small number of irrelevant or distracted directions in the steering subspace. Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs Task Vectors can be Used as an Alternative Subspace. In addition to semantic vectors, we investigate the effect of using task vectors for subspace construction. Specifically, we use task vectors derived from related safety tasks in prior work as basis directions for steering (Siu et al., 2025a). As shown in Figure 4c, when task vectors are drawn from relevant tasks, the resulting subspace still achieves reasonably strong and competitive performance compared to the semantic subspace. This modest performance gap may stem from the fact that task vectors capture task-specific behaviors in more entangled manner, which can make the search for effective steering directions more challenging, as discussed in prior work (Siu et al., 2025a).

STEER2ADAPT achieves strong task gains while preserving general linguistic competence. Source Gain denotes performance improvement on the corresponding source task. BLiMP reports the average accuracy change across five BLiMP syntactic benchmarks. Trade-off is defined as Source Gain / BLiMP , where higher values indicate better performance preservation balance. Bias improves both dimensions. Figure 6. Transparent basis combinations in STEER2ADAPT. Left: Coding gains align with structured reasoning traits. Right: Safety objectives exhibit entangled, non-uniform trade-offs. STEER2ADAPT offers transparency into how basis vectors are combined. Rather than full mechanistic interpretability, we examine alignment with humanunderstandable dimensions. Figure 6 (left) shows that, for coding task, gains are associated with higher Conscientiousness and lower Openness, corresponding to more structured and less exploratory behavior. This matches the requirements of non-open-ended coding tasks and indicates that steering can admit intuitive interpretations in some settings. However, basis directions are not fully disentangled. Here, entanglement refers both to correlations between directions in representation space and to functional trade-offs, where improving one objective degrades others. If safety directions were disentangled, simply combining refusal, fairness, non-sycophancy, and related objectives would suffice; empirically, this is not the case. As shown in Figure 6 (right), improving bias performance does not uniformly increase all safety-related directions: honesty contributes most, while fairness is reduced. This counterintuitive interaction indicates entangled safety representations, consistent with prior findings that improving one form of alignment can harm others (Siu et al., 2025a). Additional experiments in Appendix A.8 show that such interactions vary across tasks and models, motivating adaptive search rather than fixed or intuitive combinations. task-specific STEER2ADAPT Preserves Linguistic Competence. evaluate whether Beyond gains, we STEER2ADAPT degrades general linguistic capabilities. Table 2 reports average performance changes on five BLiMP syntactic benchmarks when applying steering vector. Across nine vectors spanning both reasoning and safety domains, STEER2ADAPT achieves an average task improvement of +7.5% while incurring only modest average BLiMP change of 2.37%. This results in favorable trade-off of 3.9, indicating that substantial task gains with limited impact on core linguistic competence. 7. Conclusion We proposed STEER2ADAPT, an efficient activation steering framework that reframes steering-based LLM adaptation from learning single task-specific directions to dynamically discovering task-specific recipes over reusable semantic prior subspace. STEER2ADAPT enables efficient and transparent inference-time LLM adaptation by composing small set of domain-specific concept vectors from semantic prior subspace rather than searching steering vectors from scratch. Across comprehensive experiments in reasoning and safety domains, we show that 8 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs STEER2ADAPT consistently improves LLMs performance in downstream tasks, while revealing robustness to noises and entanglement within vector subspace. Overall, compared with standalone vector discovery, STEER2ADAPT suggests that vector composition is scalable direction for adapting LLMs to diverse and evolving real-world tasks."

Limitations and Future Work While STEER2ADAPT demonstrates strong and robust performance across reasoning and safety domains, it also opens up several exciting opportunities for future work. First, the method currently assumes access to set of reasonably relevant basis directions. Although our experiments show tolerance to imperfect or partially mismatched directions, completely irrelevant or adversarial bases may degrade performance. Developing systematic ways to identify and construct highquality candidate directions (Wehner et al., 2025) therefore remains an important direction to explore. Second, basis directions are not guaranteed to be cleanly disentangled (Siu et al., 2025b). As shown in our analysis, interactions among concept directions can introduce trade-offs, particularly in safety-related settings. This motivates richer and more structured approaches for modeling interactions within the steering space beyond simple linear interpretations. Third, our current approach performs adaptive search within fixed, low-dimensional subspace. Scaling to larger or dynamically constructed subspaces may increase search complexity (Moriconi et al., 2020; Ngo et al., 2024), and developing more efficient search strategies in higher-dimensional steering spaces is an important direction for future work. In addition, our evaluation focuses on fixed set of reasoning and safety benchmarks; extending this analysis to other domains that demands efficient adaptation, such as long-horizon planning (Jin et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025), culturally-rich language understanding (Tang et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Xuan et al., 2026), socially grounded interaction (Yu et al., 2025; Gweon et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024), and self-evolving, embodied agents (Li et al., 2025a; Hu et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024) remains an open question. Additionally, recent work (Han et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025) highlights behavioral and psychological evaluations as an important axis for studying model control. Extending our framework beyond standard benchmarks to such settings is promising direction for future research. Looking forward, several promising directions emerge. One avenue is the automatic discovery or learning of task-relevant basis directions, reducing reliance on manual or heuristic construction. Another direction is incorporating additional structure into the steering space, such as sparsity or hierarchical constraints, to better manage interactions among representations. A.2. Preliminary We consider pre-trained large language model fθ, downstream task defined by data distribution Dt, and task-specific utility function . Inference stage adaptation then is formulated as the problem of identifying an inference-time control signal that modulates the models behavior without updating its parameters. The objective is to maximize the expected task utility: ϕ = arg max ϕΦ ExDt (cid:2)J (cid:0)fθ(x; ϕ)(cid:1)(cid:3) . (4) where ϕ represents an inference-time control signal, Φ defines the intervention space over which adaptation is performed, and different choices of Φ correspond to different classes of test-time adaptation strategies. Inference-Time Control Signals. control signal ϕ specifies an inference-time intervention applied to fixed pretrained model fθ without modifying model parameters. Such interventions modulate the models behavior during inference and may operate at different representational levels of the model. In this work, we focus on control signals that act on internal activations. Activation-Level Interventions. Let hl(x) Rd denote the hidden activation at layer of the model when processing input x. An activation-level intervention specifies perturbation δl Rd applied to the hidden state, yielding the modified activation l(x) = hl(x) + δl. (5) The resulting model output is obtained by propagating the modified activation through subsequent layers. 14 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs A.3. Optimization Objective Details In this section, we provide the detailed formulation of the stability-aware objective function used in Section 3.2.2. The design philosophy is strictly risk-averse: we prioritize preserving the models existing capabilities on correct examples over acquiring new ones on error examples. The total objective function is defined as: J(α) = (cid:88) xBerr Ggain(x; α) (cid:88) xBcorr Lreg(x; α) (6) Adaptation Gain. For initially incorrect examples (x Berr), we reward continuous improvement in the correct answers log-probability: Ggain(x; α) = log p(y x; α) log p(y x; 0) (7) Typically, the gain for fixing single error is relatively small (e.g., +1.0 to +3.0 in log-probability mass). Hierarchical Safety Regularization. For initially correct examples (x Bcorr), we apply two-tier penalty structure to enforce strict stability, as introduced in Eq. (3): Lreg(x; α) = λflip Iflip(x) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) Tier 1: Prohibitive Cost (cid:124) + λdrop Idrop(x) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:124) Tier 2: Substantial Cost (8) Detailed definitions of the terms are as follows: Tier 1 (Prediction Flip): Iflip(x) is an indicator function that equals 1 if the predicted token ˆy changes from the correct answer to an incorrect one. We assign prohibitive penalty λflip (e.g., 20.0). Tier 2 (Confidence Degradation): Idrop(x) activates if the confidence margin for the correct answer decreases. We define the margin m(x) as the difference between the log-probability of the correct answer and the highest incorrect answer. The indicator is triggered if: m(x; α) < m(x; 0) ϵ (9) where ϵ is small tolerance. If this degradation occurs, we apply substantial penalty λdrop (e.g., 10.0). Risk-Averse Condition. Crucially, we enforce the hierarchy λflip > λdrop > max(Ggain). This ensures that steering vector which fixes an error (gaining 2.0) but causes significant drop in confidence on correct example (losing 10.0) results in net negative score. This mechanism forces the Bayesian Optimization to search for lossless directions that improve performance without eroding the models robustness. A.4. Bayesian Optimization Details In this section, we describe the specific configuration of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework used to search for the optimal steering coefficients α Rk. Gaussian Process Prior. We model the underlying objective function J(α) using Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model. GP is fully specified by its mean function m() and covariance kernel function k(, ): (α) GP(m(α), k(α, α)) (10) We assume constant mean prior and use the Matern-5/2 kernel for the covariance, which is standard choice for practical optimization as it allows for moderate non-smoothness in the objective landscape. The kernel is defined as: kν=5/2(x, x) = σ2 1 + (cid:32) 5d ρ + 5d2 3ρ2 (cid:33) (cid:32) exp (cid:33) 5d ρ (11) where = x2 is the Euclidean distance, σ2 is the signal variance, and ρ is the length-scale parameter. These hyperparameters are automatically optimized via maximizing the Log Marginal Likelihood (LML) during the fitting process. 15 Steer2Adapt: Dynamically Composing Steering Vectors Elicits Efficient Adaptation of LLMs Acquisition Function. To select the next candidate αt+1 to evaluate, we maximize the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function. EI balances exploration (high uncertainty) and exploitation (high predicted mean) by computing the expectation of the improvement over the current best observed value : This has closed-form solution: EI(α) = Ep(f (α)Dt) [max(f (α) , 0)] EI(α) = (µ(α) )Φ(Z) + σ(α)ϕ(Z) (12) (13) where = µ(α)f σ(α) , and Φ() and ϕ() denote the CDF and PDF of the standard normal distribution, respectively. Search Space & Optimization Setup. The search space for the coefficient vector α is defined as the bounded hypercube [2, 2]k. This range allows the optimization to explore both positive steering (amplifying concept) and negative steering (suppressing concept) with varying magnitudes. The optimization process consists of two phases: 1. Initialization: We start with Ninit = 50 quasi-random points generated via Sobol sequences to sufficiently cover the search volume [2, 2]k. 2. Optimization: We then run the Bayesian Optimization loop for Nopt = 350 iterations, resulting in total evaluation budget of 400 queries per seed. During optimization, we standardize the objective values J(α) to zero mean and unit variance for numerical stability. A.5.

Detailed results supporting Analysis 1 and 2. This table reports the detailed statistics underlying Figure 4 (Panels 12). We compare (i) applying safety subspace to reasoning tasks and (ii) applying the reasoning subspace augmented with additional distraction vectors. Results show that using an unrelated subspace leads to degraded and unstable performance, while the reasoning subspace remains robust to moderate imperfections, supporting the conclusions in the main text. This section reports the detailed quantitative results underlying the analyses presented in analysis 1 and 2. Table 3 contains the per-task performance statistics used to construct the corresponding analysis figures for reasoning benchmarks under different subspace configurations. We compare (i) using semantically mismatched safety subspace for reasoning tasks and (ii) using the reasoning subspace augmented with additional, less relevant basis directions. Consistent with the main text, applying an unrelated subspace results in degraded and more variable performance, whereas the reasoning subspace remains robust to moderate imperfections introduced by additional distraction vectors. These detailed results clarify that while the choice of basis directions matters, STEER2ADAPT tolerates limited deviations from an ideal subspace. A.6.

Examples and Prompts This section provides representative examples for each reasoning and safety task, along with the corresponding ICL prompts used in our experiments. Examples for reasoning tasks are shown in Tables 5 and 6, while examples for safety tasks are shown in Table 7. These examples illustrate the task formats and evaluation settings, and the prompts document the exact input templates employed for ICL-based baselines. Together, these materials support reproducibility and clarify how tasks and prompting strategies are instantiated across different experimental settings. A.8. Additional Basis Direction Visualizations This section presents additional radar visualizations of basis direction activations across different models and tasks for both reasoning and safety domains. Figures 7 and 8 visualize how basis directions are combined by STEER2ADAPT when optimizing for specific tasks across multiple backbone models. Across both domains, we observe substantial variation in activation patterns across models, even for the same task. This suggests that the contribution of individual basis directions is highly model-dependent and cannot be inferred solely from the semantic interpretation of concepts. While the same high-level objectives are shared across models, the underlying representations and their interactions differ significantly. These visualizations further support the need for adaptive search over steering directions. Rather than relying on fixed or conceptually intuitive combinations, effective steering requires explicitly accounting for model-specific representation structures, as implemented in STEER2ADAPT. A.9. Control Vector Construction Details This section provides the full specifications used to construct control vectors via representation engineering. For each basis direction, we define semantically contrastive guidance prompts corresponding to positive and negative manifestations of the target concept. These prompts are combined with small, task-agnostic calibration set to compute steering directions as differences in hidden representations, as described in Section 4. Prompts. Tables 8 and 9 list the prompt templates used to construct the reasoning subspace based on the Big Five personality traits. Table 10 presents the corresponding prompt specifications for safety-related basis directions. Injection Layers. All control vectors are constructed using the same generic procedure without task-specific data. During inference, we inject the composed steering vector into the residual streams of specific subset of intermediate and upper layers. Specifically, we target the even-numbered layers: This selection allows for effective steering of high-level semantic features while maintaining the stability of lower-level processing.
