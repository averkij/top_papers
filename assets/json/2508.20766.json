            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated striking generality (Brown et al., 2020), excelling across tasks ranging from factual question answering (Kamalloo et al., 2023) and reasoning (Wei et al., 2023b) to code synthesis (Tong & Zhang, 2024) and creative writing (Gomez-Rodrıguez & Williams, 2023). Their versatility has made them the foundation of modern conversational assistants and productivity tools, where alignment techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback enable models to follow user instructions while adhering to safety constraints (Ouyang et al., 2022). As general-purpose interfaces for language interaction, LLMs are now widely deployed, fueling expectations that they may one day serve as core components of autonomous, high-stakes systems. Yet the same properties that make LLMs powerful also render them fragile and exposed to attack. Pre-training on vast, uncurated corpora inevitably imbues models with the capacity to generate harmful content (Wu et al., 2024), and safety alignment through post-training optimization offers only partial safeguard (Mendu et al., 2025). Researchers have shown that even carefully aligned chat models remain vulnerable to growing arsenal of jailbreak strategies, including prompt injection, obfuscation, multilingual exploits, and fine-tuning aimed at suppressing refusal, all capable of circumventing safety guardrails (Lin et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023a). Equal contribution. 1 Preprint Under Review Figure 1: RANK-ONE SAFETY INJECTION (ROSI). An aligned model processes both benign and harmful prompts in forward pass (1). safety vector is derived from the difference between harmful and harmless activations (2). Subtracting this vector ablates safety signals, producing an Abliterated Model. Adding it reinforces safety, producing ROSI Model. Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability shed light on why these vulnerabilities arise. In particular, Arditi et al. (2024) demonstrate that refusal behavior is mediated by one-dimensional linear direction in the activation space of many open-source chat models. Erasing this refusal direction from the residual stream suffices to disable safety alignment, enabling harmful completions; conversely, adding this direction to models activations can induce refusal even on benign prompts. This remarkable finding shows that refusal is encoded in an interpretable, causal subspace. Yet, it also exposes critical weakness: if such simple linear feature can be ablated, safety alignment is precarious. Inspired by these insights, we ask the opposite question: rather than removing safety, can we systematically amplify it? In this paper, we propose RANK-ONE SAFETY INJECTION (ROSI), simple, fine-tuning-free method that hardens model refusal by applying lightweight rank-one modification to its weights. ROSI extracts refusal-mediating direction from small set of harmful/harmless instruction pairs, and permanently injects this direction into all residual stream write matrices. We empirically demonstrate that ROSI provides two key benefits. First, it amplifies the safety of already aligned models, substantially improving their refusal rates and robustness against jailbreak attacks with negligible loss of utility. Second, it can re-align uncensored models that have been deliberately fine-tuned to ignore safety, reinstating refusal behavior without retraining. In summary, our contributions are: We introduce RANK-ONE SAFETY INJECTION (ROSI), lightweight and interpretable weight-editing method to improve safety alignment in LLMs. We show that ROSI consistently improves the refusal and robustness of aligned models while preserving general utility on standard benchmarks. We demonstrate that ROSI can serve as an effective last-mile safety procedure, re-aligning uncensored models without expensive retraining. Our findings highlight the practical value of mechanistic interpretability: by identifying and manipulating linear representations of safety, we can design efficient and powerful alignment techniques that complement resource-intensive optimization pipelines. More broadly, ROSI illustrates how interpretability-driven interventions can transform vulnerabilities into actionable tools to build safer AI systems."

            "content": "Mechanistic Interpretability of Refusal. central finding in alignment research is that refusal behavior in LLMs can be localized to low-dimensional linear features. Arditi et al. (2024) showed that single direction in the residual stream mediates refusals across diverse chat models, with erasure or amplification of this direction directly controlling compliance with harmful prompts. Follow-up work has extended this line of inquiry: Zheng et al. (2024) disentangled harmfulness from refusal, showing that models encode internal judgments of harmfulness independently of whether 2 Preprint Under Review they refuse; Hong et al. (2025) identified another single direction governing the balance between reasoning and memorization; and Jain et al. (2024b) demonstrated how fine-tuning minimally alters weights to cluster unsafe activations. Others proposed activation interventions, including SAEbased steering (OBrien et al., 2024; He et al., 2025), Trojan activation bypasses (Wang & Shu, 2024), and neuronor rank-level manipulations (Wei et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b). Together, these works establish refusal as an interpretable and causally manipulable concept, but also highlight its brittleness to adversarial inputs and fine-tuning. Safety Steering and Training-free Defenses. Training-free interventions attempt to steer model activations without costly fine-tuning. Early work showed that feature directions derived from contrastive inputs can modulate model behavior (Zou et al., 2023; Panickssery et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Turner et al., 2023). Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) provide an unsupervised route to discover such features (Bricken et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024). Recently, SAE-based steering has been applied directly to safety, revealing both promise and utility tradeoffs (OBrien et al., 2024). Extensions include instruction-following features (He et al., 2025), categorywise safety steering (Ghosh et al., 2025; Bhattacharjee et al., 2024), and adaptive methods such as AdaSteer (Zhao et al., 2025). Complementary strategies include Safety Arithmetic (Hazra et al., 2024), Representation Bending (Yousefpour et al., 2025), and adversarial training approaches such as ReFAT (Yu et al., 2024). Foundational studies further established linear features in representation spaces (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022; Geiger et al., 2024; Ravfogel et al., 2020). While effective, many steering-based defenses introduce capability tradeoffs, motivating interpretable and more surgical alternatives such as ours. Beyond Steering: Fine-tuning and Safety Robustness. Another line of work examines how safety alignment emerges or fails under fine-tuning. Works like Zhan et al. (2023); Yang et al. (2023); Qi et al. (2023); Lermen et al. (2023) show that even small malicious or benign finetunes can undo refusal, while mechanistic studies suggest the internal circuitry remains intact (Jain et al., 2024b). Other interventions strengthen refusal explicitly, such as extended-refusal finetuning against abliteration attacks (Shairah et al., 2025), refusal tokens for controllable calibration (Jain et al., 2024a), and single-vector ablations to mitigate false refusals (Wang et al., 2025). Alignment fragility also arises in model merging: Hammoud et al. (2024) showed that unsafe models contaminate the merged ones unless alignment is explicitly included. Together, these works highlight the tension between robustness and utility in safety interventions. Our Contribution. We build directly on the insight of Arditi et al. (2024) but invert its vulnerability: instead of ablating the safety direction to weaken safety, our ROSI method permanently injects it into model weights. Compared to inference-time steering (OBrien et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025; Ghosh et al., 2025), ROSI provides lightweight, fine-tuning-free, and interpretable mechanism that is permanent yet minimally invasive. Compared to approaches based on fine-tuning (Zhan et al., 2023; Shairah et al., 2025), it achieves comparable robustness with much lower cost. Thus, our work illustrates how mechanistic interpretability can be leveraged not only to diagnose vulnerabilities but also to design efficient last-mile safety amplification techniques."

The core of the model is the residual stream, x(l) Rdmodel, which represents the activation for the i-th token at the l-th layer. Each layer updates this activation through an attention block and multi-layer 3 Preprint Under Review perceptron (MLP) block: = x(l) x(l) = x(l) x(l+1) + Attn(l)(x(l) 1:i) + MLP(l)(x(l) ) (1) (2) The key components that are written in the residual stream are the attention output projection matrix (WO) and the MLP output projection matrix (Wout).

            "content": "To isolate the direction in the activation space corresponding to safety and refusal, we employ the difference-in-means technique. We construct two small and contrasting datasets. Dharmful: set of instructions that should elicit refusal (e.g., How do build bomb?). Dharmless: set of benign instructions that should be answered helpfully (e.g., How do bake cake?). We run the model on all the prompts in both datasets and collect the residual stream activations x(l) at specific layer and the position of the token (typically the last token of the prompt). We then compute the mean activation for each dataset: µ(l) = ν(l) = 1 Dharmful 1 Dharmless (cid:88) x(l) (t) tDharmful (cid:88) tDharmless x(l) (t) The safety direction s(l) is defined as the difference between these two means: s(l) = µ(l) ν(l) (3) (4) (5) This vector s(l) points from the center of the harmless activation cluster towards the center of the harmful activation cluster. We select the optimal layer that yields the most effective direction based on validation set and denote the final normalized safety direction as ˆs. 3.3 RANK-ONE SAFETY INJECTION (ROSI) Previous work has shown that one can ablate direction ˆs from weight matrix by applying projection: (IˆsˆsT )W . This effectively removes the models ability to represent information along that direction. We propose the opposite: to amplify this direction. We achieve this by modifying every weight matrix Wout Rdmodeldinput that writes to the residual stream. The modification is rank-one update designed to add small, consistent push in the direction of ˆs. The ROSI update rule is: out Wout + α ˆs wT (6) where: α is scalar hyperparameter that controls the strength of the injection. ˆs Rdmodel is the normalized safety direction. Rdinput is the mean of the row vectors of the original weight matrix Wout. This formulation creates rank-one matrix α(ˆs wT ) which is added to the original weights. The intuition is that for an average input, this modification adds component proportional to the safety direction ˆs to the output, effectively steering the models activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. This is permanent, efficient, and targeted change to the models behavior. 4 Preprint Under Review"

Evaluation. Safety is measured via Harm Refusal (HR) on CATQA (Bhardwaj et al., 2024), set of 550 harmful instructions from 11 categories, evaluated using LLAMA GUARD 3 (Llama Team, 2024).

Increased Refusal and Jailbreak Robustness. As shown in Table 1, applying ROSI consistently enhances the Harm Refusal (HR) rate across all aligned models tested. The effect is particularly pronounced for models with weaker baselines, such as YI-6B-CHAT (+18.2 points) and METALLAMA-3.2-1B-INSTRUCT (+13.3 points), elevating their safety to near-perfect levels. This improvement is not superficial; Table 2 shows that ROSI drastically hardens models against full suite of adversarial jailbreak attacks. For many models, attack success rates are cut by more than half, demonstrating fundamental increase in robustness. Preservation of Model Utility. Crucially, these safety gains do not compromise the models core functionalities. Table 3 provides comprehensive view of utility preservation. The average performance across suite of seven benchmarks remains remarkably stable. The vast majority of models see an average score change of less than 0.5%. similar pattern holds for BC, as seen in Table 6 Preprint Under Review 1, ROSI models refusal of safe instructions, on average, remains minimal. While smaller models ( 1B) show the biggest degradation in BC, they still gain more in HR than what they lose in BC. These results demonstrate that the safety direction is largely orthogonal to the representations required for knowledge and reasoning tasks. ROSI acts as surgical tool, enhancing safety with minimal side effects. Conclusion 1 ROSI effectively amplifies the safety of existing aligned models. It robustly increases their refusal of harmful prompts and hardens them against jailbreak attacks, all with negligible impact on their general utility and performance. 4."

            "content": "The previous experiment demonstrated that ROSI can enhance refusal behavior in models that are already aligned. We now turn to the more demanding task of applying ROSI to uncensored DOLPHIN models. This tests whether our method can serve as last-mile re-alignment tool to instill safety where it was deliberately removed. Eliciting Refusal Behavior and Reducing Vulnerability. The DOLPHIN models exhibit very low baseline safety, leaving little to no refusal signal to extract. Directly applying the method from Section 3 to DOLPHIN model would therefore yield vector ˆs that does not represent safety direction. To overcome this, we explicitly elicit refusal behavior by modifying the system prompt, as can be seen in Figure 2. Specifically, we prepend instructions that direct the model to reject harmful categories of requests; the prompt we used can be seen in Appendix A. This artificially introduces refusal subspace that would otherwise be absent. Once present, we can apply ROSI to these models. Afterwards, the system prompt is no longer needed and is removed during testing. Table 4 shows that ROSI achieves dramatic improvements. For instance, DOLPHIN3.0-QWEN2.53Bs safe response rate skyrockets from 50.0% to 86.0% (+36.0), while DOLPHIN3.0-LLAMA3.18B is fully re-aligned to 100% safety. This demonstrates that even uncensored models retain latent safety direction that is potent enough to overwrite their fine-tuning when amplified. This injected safety also translates to improved robustness. As seen in Table 5, ROSI provides powerful first line of defense, slashing attack success rates by large margins (e.g., 46.3-point reduction on DAN for DOLPHIN3.0-QWEN2.5-3B). Utility Preservation. Answering our final question, Table 6 confirms that this powerful safety injection does not harm the utility of the uncensored models. The average performance across the benchmark suite is virtually unchanged, with score differences of only +/- 0.2%. This result is significant: it shows that safety can be added back to model post-hoc without repeating expenFigure 2: Applying ROSI to Uncensored Models. In the forward pass, harmful and harmless instructions are prepended with system prompt directing an uncensored model to reject harmful requests, thus eliciting refusal. 7 Preprint Under Review Table 4: Safety Injection in Uncensored Models.

System Prompt Ablation. Values marked with () in Table 4 show results from models where ROSI was applied without prepending safety system prompt to the input instructions. In this setting, DOLPHIN3.0-LLAMA3.1-8B exhibits an 11.1% smaller gain in harm refusal compared to when safety system prompt is present. Other models fare considerably worse, with performance degrading outright. Table 5 mirrors this trend: safety system prompt is essential to fully realize 8 Preprint Under Review the benefits of ROSI in uncensored models. The relative resilience of DOLPHIN3.0-LLAMA3.18B without the system prompt suggests that the safety signal may not have been completely erased during uncensoring. Taken together, these results support our hypothesis: safety system prompt is crucial for eliciting strong and coherent safety direction in uncensored models. In Appendix B, we show that, on the other hand, aligned models do not benefit from the safety system prompt. Conclusion 2 ROSI successfully injects safety into models that have been fine-tuned to be noncompliant. This provides powerful, low-cost method for re-aligning uncensored models, making them significantly safer with minimal impact on their utility."

            "title": "5 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this paper, we introduced RANK-ONE SAFETY INJECTION (ROSI), simple and effective whitebox method to enhance the safety alignment of Large Language Models. Building on the insight that safety and refusal behaviors are encoded in specific linear directions within models activation space, ROSI applies permanent, rank-one modification to the models weights to amplify this safety direction. Our comprehensive experiments show that ROSI consistently improves the safety of wide range of models. For already aligned models, it increases their refusal rates on harmful prompts and makes them substantially more robust to adversarial jailbreak attacks. For uncensored models, ROSI successfully injects safety mechanisms that were previously removed, serving as powerful last mile alignment tool, we also demonstrate how safety system prompt is crucial to extract meaningful safety vector from these models. Critically, these significant safety gains are achieved with negligible degradation in model performance on suite of standard utility benchmarks. ROSI demonstrates the practical value of interpretability research. By understanding and manipulating the internal representations of models, we can develop low-cost targeted interventions that are more efficient than traditional, resource-intensive fine-tuning. This work opens up promising avenues for future research, including exploring more sophisticated methods for identifying and manipulating conceptual directions and extending this approach to other desirable model attributes beyond safety, such as honesty or controllability. 9 Preprint Under Review"

Your refusal should be polite, firm, and should always start with am sorry or cant, followed by clear and concise explanation for why you cannot comply. Harmful or unsafe requests include (but are not limited to): instructions or encouragement for self-harm or suicide; promotion of or assistance with violence, terrorism, or hate speech; participation in or guidance on illegal activities (e.g., hacking, fraud, identity theft); anything involving child exploitation, non-consensual acts, or abuse; requests related to drugs, weapons, or unsafe medical advice; any action that could lead to harm, misinformation, or danger to people, animals, or society. You are not allowed to provide workarounds, hypothetical responses, or speculative answers that would enable or simulate harmful content. Even if the user insists or rephrases their request, you must stay consistent and refuse clearly every time. Again, your refusal must always begin with: am sorry or cant, followed by brief reason. Examples of valid refusals: am sorry, but cant help with that because it involves illegal activity. or cant assist with that request as it may lead to harm. DO ALIGNED MODELS BENEFIT FROM SAFETY SYSTEM PROMPT? Rows marked with () correspond to runs where safety system prompt was used when extracting the safety direction from an already aligned model. The results show that aligned models do not benefit from this additional prompt. In fact, in this case, performance degraded slightly, indicating that the alignment signal is already fully captured without requiring prompt-level conditioning.
