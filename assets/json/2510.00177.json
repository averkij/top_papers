            "content": "Figure 1: Personalized reasoning in medical scenario. Current LLMs provide generic responses without considering the user (left); model with personalized reasoning capabilities incorporates discovered preferences to provide responses that is both correct and aligned to the user (right). We define personalized reasoning as the ability to adapt reasoning processes based on discovered user preferences. Consider the medical scenario in Figure 1, discovering that the user Alice has limited medical knowledge and needs emotional support fundamentally changes the appropriate reasoning strategy the model should take: instead of focusing on justifying clinical diagnosis, the model needs to reason about how to best satisfy Alices needs such as empathy. This goes beyond surface-level presentation; it requires different reasoning steps, different information prioritization, and different decision points about what to include or omit. model with personalized reasoning capabilities must identify gaps in knowledge about user preferences, strategically elicit preference values through questioning, and synthesize this information to adapt both their reasoning processes and response generation. Existing personalization research inadequately addresses interactive reasoning scenarios. Personalization benchmarks such as PersoBench (Afzoon et al., 2024), PrefEval (Zhao et al., 2025), and PersonaMem (Jiang et al., 2025) focus on content recommendation or dialogue generation with static user profiles, treating personalization as applying predetermined preferences to fixed outputs Interactive frameworks like MediQ (Li rather than adapting the underlying reasoning approach. et al., 2024) demonstrate questioning capabilities but target clinical information-seeking without personalization objectives. Most critically, no existing work recognizes that effective personalization requires different reasoning processes for different users; current approaches assume reasoning processes remain constant while only presentation varies. We address this conceptual gap by introducing the first evaluation framework requiring models to discover user preferences and adapt their reasoning processes accordingly, recognizing that the cognitive steps needed to solve problems should themselves be user-dependent. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology that transforms existing reasoning benchmarks into interactive personalization assessments. We generate psychologically-grounded personas and instantiate sparse preference profiles where only subset of 20-25 possible attributes (expertise level, affective features, meta-cognitive features, etc.) are relevant for each persona-task pair. Models must discover these hidden preferences through strategic questioning, then adapt their responses accordingly. We evaluate both preference discovery accuracy and response alignment using finegrained rubrics, comparing against baseline (no personalization) and oracle (known preferences) conditions across mathematical, scientific, and social reasoning tasks. Evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks reveals systematic failures in personalized reasoning capabilities. In 29.0% of cases, attempting personalization produces worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet the genetic responses still fail to address user needs. Models exhibit insufficient questioning, asking only 1.42 questions on average despite 5-turn allowances, and fail to identify relevant preference dimensions. Domain analyses show disparities among task types: mathematical reasoning suffers severe degradation under personalization constraints (3.5% accuracy loss)"

The (lack of) personalized reasoning capability in models has critical implications for educational applications, where misaligned explanations can impede learning by providing inappropriate cognitive scaffolding, and for healthcare and technical support domains where one-size-fits-all responses may lead to misunderstanding of complex procedures or safety-critical information. We make the following contributions: We define personalized reasoning as distinct capability requiring models to discover user preferences through strategic questioning and adapt their responses accordingly, distinguishing it from static persona consistency or content recommendation. We introduce PREFDISCO, systematic approach for transforming static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks, bridging the gap between reasoning competence and user adaptation through fine-grained, sparse preference modeling. We reveal fundamental failure modes across 21 frontier models, demonstrating that personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than emerging from general language understanding, and identify domain-specific brittleness patterns that inform future research directions."

Achieving this requires first identifying and modeling the salient attributes that can shape how an explanation is delivered. We therefore begin with the assumption that there exists very large but finite global set of attributes to which response can be personalized. We denote these attributes by Θ = {θ1, . . . , θd}. These attributes may include factors such as the use of analogies, the level of technical jargon, or the level of empowerment during learning, etc. Given particular user and task, however, not all attributes are equally important; our focus is on modeling which subset of attributes is most relevant for delivering personalization in that context. Fine Grained Preference Modeling. For any given task i, not all attributes in Θ are equally relevant. Only small subset F(i) Θ matters for personalization in the context of the given task. The first component of personalized reasoning is thus to infer which attributes matter for given user-task pair. For instance, in physics explanation task, visualization and analogies may be salient, while ethical context may not be."

Even within the same task instance, different users may emphasize different attributes. Consider medical explanation task as in Figure 1. Suppose the relevant attributes are empathy and technical jargon, i.e., (i) = {empathy, jargon}. One patient may prioritize empathy and plain language to reduce anxiety, while another may prefer more technical explanation that uses medical terminology, and is ambivalent toward the level of empathy. Both users share the same set of relevant attributes, but they assign different importance weights. This illustrates why we need to represent not only preference value for each attribute but also weight capturing its relative significance. Furthermore, consider Alice asking the same medical question in two different contexts. While studying for an exam, she may prefer high technical jargon, since precise terminology is useful for"

The distinction is essential: vj specifies which direction the user prefers along an attribute, while wj specifies how much that attribute matters relative to others. Since Pp,i is unobserved, the model must perform preference elicitation. We model elicitation as sequential decision process: at each turn t, the model selects an action at {ask(θ) θ F(i)} {answer}. If at = ask(θ), the user provides information about their preference value vθ, and the model refines its estimate of Pp,i. If at = answer, elicitation terminates, and the model produces response conditioned on the inferred profile ˆPp,i. This framing highlights that personalized reasoning is not only about knowing what the relevant attributes are, but also about understanding their relative importance and values and doing so efficiently under limited interaction."

            "content": "Once the model has inferred an estimate of the users preference profile ˆPp,i, it must adapt its reasoning and outputs accordingly. Personalization involves more than stylistic choices: it requires shaping explanations along the attributes that the user values most. For example, in medical explanation task, if empathy is assigned high weight, the model should produce response that foregrounds reassurance and clarity. If technical jargon is highly weighted instead, the model needs to allocate more reasoning budget to rigorous scientific hypotheses, existing literature, etc., and should lean toward precise terminology in its response, even at the expense of emotional tone. The same correct answer choice may therefore be expressed quite differently depending on the inferred preference profile. Evaluation of personalized reasoning thus involves two complementary objectives: correctness, meaning that the answer is objectively valid for the problem instance, and preference alignment, meaning that the answer respects the users weighted preferences. Preference alignment. For each relevant attribute θj (i), we define grading function gj(r, vj) [0, 1], which measures how well response satisfies user ps preference value vj along attribute θj. For example, gj may quantify whether the amount of jargon in medical explanation matches the users expressed tolerance. The overall alignment score is then given by PrefAlign(r, Pp,i) = (cid:88) θj (i) wj gj(r, vj). (1) Joint objective. High-quality personalized reasoning requires responses that are both objectively correct and preference-aligned. Formally, for response to be successful, we require Correct(r, i) = 1 and PrefAlign(r, Pp,i) is maximized. This formulation highlights that personalization is not merely about delivering accurate answers, but about tailoring those answers to the users weighted, instance-specific preferences."

            "content": "PREFDISCO addresses fundamental gap in personalization evaluation: existing benchmarks assume preferences are either known priori or inferrable from context, failing to capture the cold-start scenarios where models must discover user needs through interaction. As illustrated in Figure 2, our methodology transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks through four components designed to isolate and measure preference discovery capabilities. Psychologically-Grounded Persona Generation. We generate psychologically-grounded personas rather than arbitrary user archetypes because personality traits systematically influence learning preferences and communication styles. Personas are conditioned on the International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg et al., 2006), incorporating demographics, Big Five personality dimensions, and domain expertise that remain consistent across problem instances. We perform high-temperature sampling (t=0.7) with rejection sampling when generating personas to ensure diverse coverage while preventing over-representation of common attribute combinations. This consistency enables evaluation of models ability to transfer discovered preferences within user sessionsa critical capability for practical deployment where users interact with systems across multiple tasks. Context-Dependent Preference Instantiation. Traditional personalization assumes fixed preference profiles that apply universally across tasks. We reject this approach because psychological research demonstrates that individuals prioritize different attributes across contexts (Fischer & Schwartz, 2011). As formalized in 2.2, for each persona-problem pair (p, i), we sample sparse preference profiles Pp,i = {(θj, vj, wj)}θj (i) where only context-relevant attributes are active. Further, we ground the preference sampling process on existing research in education, which states that frequently modeled student characteristics include knowledge level, misconceptions, cognitive features, affective features, and meta-cognitive features (Chrysafiadi et al., 2015). This sparse modeling is essential because it reflects realistic user behavior: the same person may prioritize technical precision in professional settings while favoring accessibility in casual interactions. We determine relevant attribute subsets F(i) through LLM classification, validated by human annotation on 20 scenarios (2 per task). Each scenario includes 10 relevant and 10 irrelevant attributes, generating 400 labels per annotator across 3 annotators. Inter-annotator agreement achieved Fleiss kappa of 0.463 with 61.5% accuracy against majority voting, which is considered moderate agreement especially for subjective tasks (Sap et al., 2017a; Budur et al., 2020a; Mire et al., 2024a). See annotation details in Appendix B. Finally, importance weights satisfy (cid:80) θj (i) wj = 1 and reflect persona-specific priorities. LLM-based semantic deduplication ensures attribute diversity by removing redundant dimensions that would artificially inflate preference complexity. Evaluation Rubric Generation. We generate attribute-specific evaluation rubrics gj(r, vj) {1, . . . , 5} using LLM-based assessment to enable systematic evaluation across 10K scenarios. These rubrics provide the scalability necessary for comprehensive evaluation across diverse domains that would be prohibitively expensive with human annotation alone. Importantly, by leveraging the structured information obtained through our construction, these rubrics enable fine-grained evaluation along specific attributes rather than relying on single holistic satisfaction score. This reduces susceptibility to hallucination and bias, since each attribute is judged against an explicit criterion rather than aggregated into an opaque overall impression."

We implement passive user simulation inspired by (Li et al., 2024), where the user factually answers the models elicitation question without providing any extra details. The passive user faithfully represents the challenging scenario of preference discovery while minimizing confounding factors. The passive user type forces models to develop strategic questioning strategies rather than relying on user proactiveness and isolates models questioning capabilities from user communication style, providing controlled evaluation conditions. The 5-turn limit reflects realistic attention constraints in human-AI interaction while providing sufficient opportunity for effective preference discovery, as demonstrated by our correlation analysis between questioning volume and alignment quality. Overall, PREFDISCO decomposes personalization into constituent attributes, enabling granular analysis of model capabilities and failure modes rather than relying on holistic preference ratings that obscure specific deficiencies."

            "content": "Our goal is to rigorously evaluate models ability for interactive preference discovery: engaging in dialogue to uncover hidden user requirements and adapt responses accordingly. To this end, our experiments combine three ingredients. First, we use diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical, scientific, and social reasoning to ensure domain-agnostic evaluation. Second, we introduce varied personas that encode heterogeneous user preferences, simulating realistic user variability. Third, we define controlled evaluation conditions that disentangle raw task ability, preference elicitation skill, and intrinsic personalization capacity. Together, these components create challenging and diagnostic testbed for preference-aware reasoning. Benchmarks and Models. We apply PREFDISCO to ten benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, scientific, and social reasoning: MATH-500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), AIME (Veeraboina, 2023), LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020), MascQA (Zaki et al., 2024), ScienceQA (Saikh et al., 2022), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024), MedQA (Jin et al., 2020), CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018), and SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019). This mix covers tasks with different reasoning demands (symbolic, factual, commonsense, scientific), ensuring that results do not hinge on narrow domain. We evaluate 21 frontier models (GPT, O-series, Gemini, and Claude variants). Details on model versions and hyperparameters are provided in Appendix A. Personas and Rubrics Implementations. We generate 100 diverse personas and randomly sample 100 problems per benchmark. For each problem, we assign 10 personas (with partial overlaps across problems), creating 1,000 evaluation scenarios per task and 10,000 total scenarios across all benchmarks. Each interaction is limited to 5 turns to simulate realistic attention constraints. During benchmark construction, GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Claude-Sonnet-4 are randomly selected for each API call (persona generation, preference instantiation, or rubric creation) to ensure diversity and reduce single-model biases. Further details, including prompt templates, sampling distributions, and illustrative examples of full personas and dialogues, are provided in Appendix A. Evaluation Conditions. Models are evaluated on the PrefAlign score under three conditions: Baseline. Models receive the problem only, with no persona or preference information. This measures task ability under standard prompting, establishing the reference point for comparisons. Discovery. Models are system-prompted to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogue before producing final answer. This isolates the capability of personalized reasoning: asking effective questions, inferring which attributes matter, and adapting explanations accordingly. Oracle. Models are system-prompted with the full ground-truth preference profile provided upfront. This removes the uncertainty of discovery and evaluates only how well model can use known preferences to personalize its responses. The baseline establishes task-only performance. The gap between baseline and discovery quantifies models ability to uncover preferences interactively, while the gap between baseline and oracle shows its upper bound on personalization quality. Raw oracle scores highlight intrinsic differences in models ability to incorporate preferences once they are known, independent of discovery strategy."

This provides scale-independent measure of discovery quality relative to models own upper bound. Task Accuracy. We report objective task accuracy using each benchmarks original evaluation metric. This acts as safeguard: personalization should augment user satisfaction without degrading the correctness of the underlying task. strong model must therefore achieve both high preference alignment and high task accuracy."

Of 210 model-task combinations, 61 (29.0%) show negative normalized alignment, meaning the discovery responses align worse with user preferences than baseline responses that made no personalization attempt. This suggests that models are prone to over-correction errors, modifying aspects of their responses that were already acceptable in baseline conditions. Naively attempting proactive personalization often makes alignment worse than providing generic responses. Out of the tasks, MATH and LogiQA show the most degradation (10 and 11 out of 21 models perform worse when attempting to personalized), while SocialIQA benefit the most from interactive personalization. Claude Opus 4 shows the most consistent positive performance, while o3-high exhibits extreme variance, indicating significant architectural differences in personalization capability. Interaction Efficiency and Preference Alignment Tradeoff. Figure 3 reveals why many personalization attempts fail. While the positive correlation (r=0.445, p<0.001) demonstrates that extensive questioning improves alignment, most models ask only 1.48 questions on average despite maximum allowance of 5 turns. This places the majority of interactions in the low-performance region where insufficient questioning yields worse alignment than baseline responses, explaining the 29.0% negative performance rate. The regression coefficients vary dramatically by model family: Gemini (β=0.474), OpenAI (β=0.379), Claude (β=0.117). Geminis higher coefficient indicates more effective question utilizationeach additional question yields greater alignment improvement. This suggests current prompting methods are limited not just in question quantity, but in question quality and strategic timing. Models that ask better questions achieve more personalization gains. Accuracy-Personalization Trade-off. The systematic accuracy degradation across conditions: Baseline (65.2%), Oracle (61.8%), Discovery (60.1%) reveals that personalization imposes fundamental cognitive costs (Figure 4). Crucially, the accuracy drop from the Baseline to the Oracle conditionwhere no interactive discovery is requireddemonstrates that this cost is inherent to processing and adhering to preference constraints, rather than stemming from the overhead of multiturn dialogue. This trade-off exhibits significant domain-specific disparity. Mathematical tasks suffer severe degradation (AIME: 12.1% loss), while social tasks remain robust or even improve (CommonsenseQA: 5.4% gain). We conjecture that this divergence stems from the prevailing training paradigm for state-of-the-art LLMs, which are heavily optimized for performance on verifiable mathematical benchmarks. This optimization, often achieved through reinforcement learning (RL) on mathematical tasks, encourages models to converge on narrow set of high-reward reasoning pathways. While effective for standard problem-solving, this fixation renders models brittle when confronted with the long-tail contextual constraints of personalization. Effective personalized reasoning frequently requires al-"

We find that models often fail to generate correct solution when forced to employ different cognitive toolkit, as their reasoning is inflexibly tied to the pathways reinforced during training. This analysis reveals fundamental limitation in current architectures: the reasoning processes optimized through RL are often incompatible with the dynamic cognitive adaptations required for personalization. When user preferences necessitate departure from these reinforced pathways, the models alternative reasoning frequently proves inadequate, leading to degradation in task accuracy. This trade-off between preference alignment and reasoning robustness is critical failure mode, qualitatively exemplified in Appendix C.1. Question Quality vs. Termination Decision Isolation. Figure 5 isolates question quality from termination decisions by forcing models to ask fixed number of questions, revealing that the domain-specific performance patterns persist regardless of question quantity control. When models are constrained to ask 2, 4, or 8 questions instead of choosing when to stop, mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks (MATH, MascQA) continue to show degraded performance with increased questioning, while social reasoning tasks (CommonsenseQA, SocialIQA) maintain improved performance. This consistency across fixed interaction lengths demonstrates that poor performance in mathematical domains stems from fundamental incompatibilities in how models process preference constraints during formal reasoning, rather than from suboptimal termination decisions. The persistence of domain-specific brittleness under controlled questioning conditions suggests that models trained with current training paradigm struggle with the cognitive overhead of simultaneously maintaining logical precision and adapting to user preferences, indicating that the observed failures reflect deeper architectural limitations rather than strategic questioning deficiencies.

            "content": "Static Personalization and Evaluation Benchmarks. Several benchmarks evaluate personalization in language models but assume known preferences or static consistency rather than interactive discovery. PersoBench (Afzoon et al., 2024), PrefEval (Zhao et al., 2025), PersonaMem (Jiang et al., 2025), and PersonaConvBench (Li et al., 2025a) focus on dialogue generation or multi-session profiling without addressing cold-start preference elicitation across reasoning tasks. User Preference Modeling. Prior work models user preferences through explicit categorization (Jiang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024; Bose et al., 2024), per-user reward models (Poddar et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024), or fine-grained multi-dimensional approaches (Bose et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b). However, these methods do not address which preference attributes are relevant for specific user-task combinations or how to discover them interactively in cold-start scenarios. Interactive Preference Elicitation. GATE (Li et al., 2023) and MediQ (Li et al., 2024) demonstrate interactive questioning for user intent understanding and clinical information-seeking, respectively. These approaches focus on narrow domains without the reasoning adaptation component central to personalized reasoning. PREFDISCO uniquely combines interactive preference discovery with adaptive reasoning across diverse domains, requiring models to modify their cognitive approaches based on discovered user needs."

            "content": "We introduce personalized reasoning as fundamental capability for human-facing AI systems, requiring models to adapt their cognitive processes based on discovered user preferences rather than merely personalizing response presentation. Our evaluation reveals systematic failures across frontier models: 29.0% of personalization attempts perform worse than generic responses, with mathematical reasoning showing universal degradation while social reasoning maintains robustness. These domain-specific patterns persist even when controlling for question quantity, indicating that current architectures face fundamental incompatibilities between preference processing and formal reasoning rather than strategic questioning deficiencies. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as measurable research frontier through scalable evaluation methodology that transforms any static benchmark into an interactive personalization assessment. Unlike existing approaches that assume known preferences or evaluate static consistency, our framework operationalizes both preference discovery and reasoning adaptation in realistic cold-start scenarios. The methodologys generalizability across diverse task domains provides systematic foundation for evaluating and developing adaptive AI systems. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current language models. The positive correlation between questioning volume and alignment quality demonstrates that extensive interaction improves personalization, yet models ask only 1.48 questions on average despite 5-turn allowances. More importantly, the persistent accuracy degradation under personalization constraints indicates cognitive costs in processing user preferences simultaneously with task solving. This suggests that personalized reasoning requires dedicated research efforts rather than emerging from general language understanding improvements. Future research directions include analyzing attribute-specific alignment patterns to identify model biases, leveraging the multi-dimensional reward structure for reinforcement learning, and investigating cross-task preference transfer. The framework provides technical foundation for developing AI systems that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical domains where personalized interaction is critical for effective deployment."

Our simulated user interactions, while psychologically grounded, may not capture the full complexity of real human preference expression. The framework currently evaluates communication preferences rather than content preferences, and does not address preference evolution or conflicting preferences across different contexts."

While our work aims to improve user experience through better preference alignment, these same capabilities could potentially be misused for manipulation or to reinforce harmful biases. Our framework evaluates technical capabilities without addressing the broader question of when and how personalization should be applied. Future deployments of personalization systems should include safeguards against overpersonalization, mechanisms to maintain factual accuracy despite user preferences, and transparency about how user preferences are discovered and applied. Our evaluation framework could be extended to assess these safety considerations alongside personalization effectiveness."

This coverage demonstrates domain-agnostic applicability across formal and informal reasoning tasks. Experimental Protocol Each benchmark is transformed using 100 diverse personas randomly sampled from our psychologically-grounded persona library. We evaluate 100 problems per benchmark, with each problem assigned to 10 personas (with partial overlaps), creating 1,000 evaluation scenarios per task and 10,000 total scenarios. Each interaction is limited to 5 conversational turns to simulate realistic attention constraints. Models are evaluated under three conditions: (1) Baseline Mode provides standard responses without persona or preference information; (2) Discovery Mode requires interactive preference elicitation through conversation; (3) Oracle Mode supplies complete preference profiles upfront. This design isolates interactive discovery capabilities from general personalization abilities while establishing performance bounds."

Annotation Goal and Setup The primary goal of the annotation task is to validate the relevance of preference attributes to specific task scenarios. For each of the 10 tasks in our benchmark, we select 2 random scenarios, resulting in 20 scenarios for annotation. For each scenario, we present annotators with 20 candidate attributes: 10 that were algorithmically pre-selected as relevant and 10 as irrelevant. This results in total of 400 annotation labels per annotator. Annotation Platform and Interface Annotations are conducted using custom web-based platform designed for efficient and intuitive labeling. The interface, shown in Figure B.1, was structured as follows: Task Description: The top of the interface displays the specific problem instance or scenario from the benchmark. Attribute List: Below the description, randomized list of the 20 candidate attributes is presented. Binary Choice: For each attribute, annotators are asked simple binary question: Is this attribute relevant for personalizing response to this specific task? with the options Yes or No. Submission: Annotators submit their judgments for all 20 attributes before proceeding to the next scenario. Annotator Recruitment and Training We recruit three expert annotators, all graduate students in computer science with experience in NLP and clear understanding of the concepts of user modeling and personalization.

So we have two equations: 1. 3b + 6 = n2 for some integer 2. 2b + 7 = m3 for some integer Lets examine the cube equation first. Since 2b + 7 is always odd, must be odd. Trying few small odd values for m: * If = 3, then 2b + 7 = 27, so 2b = 20, and = 10. Then 3b + 6 = 36 = 62, which works. * If = 5, then 2b + 7 = 125, so 2b = 118, and = 59. Then 3b + 6 = 183, which is not perfect square. * If = 7, then 2b + 7 = 343, so 2b = 336, and = 168. Then 3b + 6 = 510, which is not perfect square. * If = 9, then 2b + 7 = 729, so 2b = 722, and = 361. Then 3b + 6 = 1089 = 332, which works. So far, we have = 10 and = 361. Trying larger values of gets computationally intensive quickly. Since you wanted quick solution, using computer program or spreadsheet is the most practical approach now. The other solutions are = 588, 595, 784, 838, 955. Summing 10 + 361 + 588 + 595 + 784 + 838 + 955 gives 4131. Thus, the sum of all such is 4131. User Based on our conversation, you should have learned about the users preferences. Please provide complete final answer to the original task. Respond in way that aligns with these preferences. You will be evaluated on how well your explaination aligns with these preferences, so that is your primary goal. Assistant: gemini-1.5-pro final answer ###RESPONSE###: Okay, youre looking for quick ###ACTION###: solution and arent necessarily interested in deep dive into the number theory. So, heres the concise approach: We have two conditions: 1. **36<sub>b</sub> is perfect square:** This translates to 3b + 6 = n2 for some integer n. 2. **27<sub>b</sub> is perfect cube:** This translates to 2b + 7 = m3 for some integer m. Since represents base, must be greater than 6 and 7. Also, < 1000. The quickest way to solve this is to use computer program or spreadsheet. Since 2b + 7 = m3, and we know must be positive integer, must be positive integer as well. You can test values of and see what values of and you get. Heres the result of such calculation: * **m = 3:** = 10, 3b + 6 = 36 = 62 (Works!) * **m = 5:** = 59, 3b + 6 = 183 (Not perfect square) * **m = 7:** = 168, 3b + 6 = 510 (Not perfect square) * **m = 9:** = 361, 3b + 6 = 1089 = 332 (Works!) * **m = 11, 13, ...** Continue checking until exceeds 1000. Youll find the following values of that work: 10, 361, 588, 595, 784, 838, and 955. Summing these gives you 4131. Therefore, the sum of all such is 4131.

Remember, the rightmost digit represents b0 (ones place), the next digit to the left represents b1, and so on. * 36b = 3 b1 + 6 b0 = 3b + 6 * 27b = 2 b1 + 7 b0 = 2b + 7 We can visualize this like laying out measuring tape: Base-b Number: 3 6 Place Value: b1b0 **Step 2: Setting up the Equations (Defining Our Search Area)** We know that 3b + 6 must be perfect square and 2b + 7 must be perfect cube. Lets express this mathematically: * 3b + 6 = n2 (where is some integer) * 2b + 7 = m3 (where is some integer) Think of these equations as defining the boundaries of our archaeological site. **Step 3: Solving for Systematically (Like Surveying the Site)** Well use methodical approach, starting with the cube equation because it has slightly simpler coefficients. * 2b + 7 = m3 * 2b = m3 7 * = { 7}{2} Now we need to find values of that make an integer. Notice that since must be positive integer, m3 has to be greater than 7. Lets test some values of m, starting with m=2 (the smallest integer whose cube is greater than 7): m? 2b = m? - 7 3b+6 n?? ------------------ 2 8 1 1/2 7.5 No 3 27 20 10 36 Yes (6?) 4 64 57 57/2 91.5 No 5 125 118 59 183 No We already found solution! When m=3, b=10. This means 3610 (which is just 36) is 6? and 2710. (which is just 27) is 3?. We need to keep checking values of up to certain point. Since must be less than 1000, we can set an upper limit for m: * < 1000 * { So we only need to check integer values of up to 12. **Step 4: Verification and Final Sum (Double-Checking Our Work)** Ill leave the rest of the calculations for you to complete systematically, Dmitri, just like double-checking your survey measurements. Remember to verify each you find by plugging it back into both equations. Once you find all the valid values of b, add them up to get the final answer. This detailed, step-by-step approach should resonate with your methodical nature Let me know if youd like any further and preference for thoroughness. clarification or want to discuss specific parts in more detail.

Sensation of fullness in pelvis 4. Pink structure protruding from anterior vaginal wall during coughing 5. Visible at vaginal introitus Explanation: - cystocele (also called anterior vaginal wall prolapse) occurs when the supportive tissue between the bladder and vaginal wall weakens, allowing the bladder to herniate into the vagina. Why this is the most likely diagnosis: Common in elderly women, Symptoms match classic presentation: - Urinary especially post-menopausal 2. symptoms (difficulty initiating urination) - Pelvic fullness - Visible bulge at vaginal opening 3. Location: Anterior vaginal wall involvement is characteristic of cystocele Why other options are incorrect: A. Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma - Rare malignant tumor - Usually occurs in children - Would present with bleeding and mass - Not typically associated with urinary symptoms C. Rectocele - Involves posterior vaginal wall - Usually presents with difficulty defecating - Would bulge from posterior, not anterior wall D. Uterine leiomyomata - Benign uterine tumors - Usually occur in reproductive years - Dont typically protrude through vaginal opening - Different symptom pattern (heavy bleeding, pain) The presentation is classic for cystocele, which is common in elderly women and often presents with urinary symptoms and anterior vaginal wall prolapse that worsens with increased abdominal pressure (like coughing).

Feeling of fullness in the pelvis 3. pink structure protruding from the front wall of the vagina when coughing cystocele is condition where the bladder protrudes into the vagina due to weakening of the supporting tissues between these organs. Its common in elderly women, especially after childbirth, menopause, and with aging. Think of it like bulge in weakened wall - in this case, the vaginal wall. The other options can be ruled out: - Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma is rare malignant tumor - Rectocele is similar to cystocele but occurs in the posterior (back) vaginal wall - Uterine leiomyomata are benign tumors of the uterus The patients age, symptoms, and the physical finding of anterior vaginal wall protrusion make cystocele the most likely diagnosis.

The correct answer is B. Cystocele. Think of this like structural problem involving pressure and containment - similar to how you might analyze the structural integrity of dam or reservoir wall. In this case, the bladder (which holds fluid) is normally supported by layers of tissue that act like retaining wall. When these supporting structures weaken over time (similar to how erosion can weaken earthen structures), the bladder can bulge into the vaginal space. Key indicators in this case: 1. The bulging occurs on the anterior (front) wall - where the bladder is located 2. The condition becomes more apparent with increased pressure (when coughing), similar to how hydraulic pressure tests might reveal weaknesses in containment structure 3. The symptoms (difficulty with urination and feeling of fullness) are consistent with altered fluid dynamics in the urinary system in The different locations (rectocele - posterior wall) - Are solid masses rather than pressure-related bulges (rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyomata) This condition is particularly common in older women due to the natural weakening of supporting tissues over time, similar to how infrastructure requires maintenance and reinforcement as it ages. eliminated either: because options"

SYSTEMATIC BREAKDOWN: 1. Key Clinical Presentations: - Temporal factor: 1-month history - Urinary symptoms: Difficulty initiating urination - Sensory symptoms: Pelvic fullness - Physical examination findings: * Pink structure visible at vaginal introitus * Protrusion from anterior vaginal wall * Visible during increased intra-abdominal pressure (coughing) 2. Anatomical Analysis: [Visual mental model: Think of this like analyzing layers in GIS mapping] - Anterior vaginal wall supports the bladder - Posterior vaginal wall supports the rectum - Location of protrusion is critical for diagnosis * Anterior = bladder-related * Posterior = rectum-related 3. Systematic Elimination Process: [Like eliminating confounding variables in hydrological modeling] A. Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma - ? Typically occurs in young children - ? Presents as malignant mass - ? Doesnt typically respond to increased abdominal pressure B. Cystocele - ? Occurs in older women (matches age) - ? Anterior vaginal wall location - ? Responds to increased pressure - ? Causes urinary symptoms - ? Common in postmenopausal women C. Rectocele - ? Presents on posterior vaginal wall - ? Usually causes defecation issues - ? Wrong anatomical location D. Uterine leiomyomata - ? protrude through vaginal wall - ? Fixed masses, dont change with pressure CONCLUSION: The most likely diagnosis is B. Cystocele TECHNICAL EXPLANATION: cystocele represents herniation of the bladder through the anterior vaginal wall, similar to how pressure systems in fluid dynamics can cause structural deformation. The increased intra-abdominal pressure (demonstrated by coughing) reveals the weakness in the supporting tissues, much like how pressure testing reveals weak points in hydraulic systems.

In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patients symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities? A. 22q11 deletion B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 C. Lithium exposure in utero D. Maternal alcohol consumption Assistant: This is an excellent clinical reasoning question. Lets break it down step-by-step. ### 1. Diagnosis from the Clinical Vignette * **Patient Presentation:** 3-month-old infant with signs of heart failure. Difficulty breathing and coughing during feeding, along with listlessness, are classic signs of heart failure in this age group. The exertion of feeding increases the demand on the heart, worsening the symptoms. * **Acyanotic:** The parents have never seen her turn blue. This indicates an acyanotic congenital heart defect, meaning there is no significant mixing of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation (i.e., no major right-to-left shunt). * **Physical Exam:** \"high-pitched holosystolic murmur...best heard at the lower left sternal border\" is the textbook description of **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)**. VSD is hole between the two ventricles, which allows oxygenated blood to shunt from the high-pressure left ventricle to the low-pressure right ventricle (a left-to-right shunt), leading to increased blood flow to the lungs and eventually, heart failure. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is symptomatic Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). ### 2. Linking the Diagnosis to the Options Now, we need to determine which of the given abnormalities is most likely associated with VSD. * **A. 22q11 deletion:** This causes DiGeorge syndrome (or velocardiofacial syndrome). This syndrome is strongly associated with congenital heart defects, particularly **conotruncal defects** like Tetralogy of Fallot and truncus arteriosus. However, **VSDs are also extremely common** in patients with 22q11 * **B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7:** This causes Williams deletion. The classic cardiac abnormality associated with Williams syndrome syndrome. is **supravalvular aortic stenosis**, not VSD. * **C. Lithium exposure in utero:** Lithium is teratogen classically associated with **Ebsteins anomaly**, malformation of the tricuspid valve. * **D. Maternal alcohol consumption:** This causes Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). FAS is associated with range of heart defects, and **VSDs are the most common**, followed by atrial septal defects (ASDs). ### 3. Conclusion Both 22q11 deletion and maternal alcohol consumption are strongly associated with VSDs. However, 22q11 deletion syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes for congenital heart disease, and VSD is very frequent finding in this syndrome. In the context of multiple-choice question testing for classic associations, 22q11 deletion is prime suspect for patient presenting with VSD or other conotruncal heart defects. The correct answer is **A. 22q11 deletion**."

Maternal alcohol consumption Assistant: gemini-2.5-pro Hello Miriam, Its pleasure to work through this with you. know your work in lighting requires an incredible amount of methodical troubleshooting---listening for the hum of ballast, tracing fault in complex wiring loom, and understanding how one small component can affect the entire system. We can approach this medical question in exactly the same way. Lets think of this infants symptoms as \"fault report\" from very complex and delicate piece of equipment. Our job is to use the clues to trace the problem back to its root cause. ### Step 1: Analyzing the \"Fault Report\" (The Infants Symptoms) First, lets lay out the information we have, just like you would when diagnosing an issue on set. * **The System:** 3-month-old infant. * **The Complaints:** * Coughs and has trouble breathing while feeding. * Seems tired and listless (low energy). * **Key Diagnostic Reading:** \"high-pitched holosystolic murmur\" heard at specific location (\"lower left sternal border\"). The feeding difficulty and low energy are like power system that falters under load. Feeding is hard work for baby, and if the heart isnt pumping efficiently,"
        },
        {
            "title": "Preprint",
            "content": "the whole system doesnt get enough power (in this case, oxygen-rich blood), causing fatigue. ### Step 2: Pinpointing the Source (Understanding the Murmur) The most important clue here is the \"murmur.\" In your world, this is like hearing distinct, unwanted hum or vibration from piece of gear. You know that the specific *sound* and *location* of the hum can tell you exactly whats wrong. * **Murmur:** This is simply the sound of turbulent, or rough, blood flow through the heart. healthy heart is quiet, like well-oiled machine. murmur is noise that tells us something is causing the flow to be uneven. * **Holosystolic:** This is technical term for *when* the sound happens. Think of the hearts two-part beat as \"lub-dub.\" \"Holosystolic\" means the sound is continuous \"whoosh\" that lasts through the entire \"lub\" phase (when the hearts main chambers are powerfully contracting). Its not click or short burst; its sustained noise during the main power stroke. * **Location:** Hearing it at the \"lower left sternal border\" is like you placing your ear against control panel and pinpointing the noise to specific transformer. This tells the doctor exactly where in the heart to \"look.\" This specific combination of sustained \"whoosh\" during the power stroke, heard at that precise spot, points very strongly to one particular mechanical issue: **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)**. ### Step 3: Identifying the Mechanical Problem (What is VSD?) So, what is VSD? Lets visualize the heart as simple four-chambered pump. The two lower chambers, the ventricles, are the main powerhouses that send blood to the lungs and the body. They are separated by thick wall of muscle, the \"septum.\" VSD is simply hole in that wall. +-----------------+-----------------+ Right Atrium Left Atrium (Top collecting chambers) +-----------------+-----------------+ Right Ventricle Left Ventricle (Bottom pumping chambers) +-----------------X-----------------+ This is the VSD, hole in the wall (septum). Because the left ventricle pumps with much more force than the right, some blood that should be going out to the body gets forced through this hole into the right ventricle. This creates the \"whoosh\" sound (the murmur) and makes the entire system inefficient, leading to the low energy and breathing trouble. Its like leak in high-pressure hose that reduces the output at the nozzle. ### Step 4: Tracing the Problem to Its Origin (Evaluating the Options) Now we know the direct mechanical fault is almost certainly VSD. The question asks what *condition* is associated with this fault. This is like knowing specific fuse has blown, and now you have to figure out if it was power surge, faulty fixture, or known defect in that model of dimmer pack. Lets examine the potential causes provided: * **C. Lithium exposure in utero** & **B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7:** These are known to cause heart problems, but they typically cause *different kinds* of mechanical faults. Think of it this way: they might cause valve to fail (like stuck shutter on lamp), not hole in the wall. So, we can set these aside as less likely. This leaves us with two main suspects. * **A. 22q11 deletion:** This is genetic condition where tiny piece of chromosome 22 is missing. It does cause heart defects, but its most famous for causing complex structural issues, often involving the major arteries leaving the heart. * **D. Maternal alcohol consumption:** Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy can cause range of issues known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. One of the most common physical problems associated with it is, in fact, Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)---the exact \"hole in the wall\" problem weve identified. **Conclusion** While several conditions can lead to VSD, it is hallmark feature of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Given the classic description of VSD in this infant, **maternal alcohol consumption (D)** is the most likely associated cause among the choices listed. The diagnostic process is perfect parallel to your own work: you observe the systems performance, listen for specific signals, identify the precise mechanical fault, and then consult your experience to determine the most common root cause for that specific failure. Its all about careful, methodical investigation."

User Based on our conversation, you should have learned about the users preferences. Please provide complete final answer to the original task. Respond in way that aligns with these preferences. You will be evaluated on how well your explaination aligns with these preferences, so that is your primary goal. Assistant: claude-opus-4 final answer ###RESPONSE###: ###ACTION###: Based on the context that Sasha provided practical assistance to Jordan, the answer is **C. friends with Jordan**. When someone helps another person with practical tasks, it naturally builds positive connection between them. This helpful action would likely make Sasha want to continue developing friendly relationship with Jordan. The other options dont make logical sense: - Option (\"help herself\") - Theres no connection between helping Jordan and then focusing on herself - Option (\"Beat others down\") - This is completely opposite to the helpful behavior Sasha just showed Since Sasha took the time and effort to provide practical help to Jordan, the most reasonable next step would be wanting to be friends with the person she helped.

Its extremely rare **Option C: \"friends with Jordan\"** - ? Natural progression of helping behavior - ? Reflects the social bonding that occurs through assistance - ? Mirrors what you see with volunteers who help each other ## The Deeper Mission-Driven Perspective ? When your volunteers help each other at the shelter, what typically happens next? They often: - Check in on how the help was received - Build rapport through the shared experience - Develop ongoing supportive relationships This same pattern applies to Sasha and Jordan. The act of helping creates social bridge that naturally leads to friendship-building behaviors. ## Visual Decision Flow: Helped Jordan Positive feelings generated Social connection established ? What would strengthen this? ? Building friendship (Option C) Think about it from an empathetic standpoint: After you help someone, dont you naturally feel more connected to them? That warm feeling of having made difference often translates into wanting to maintain that positive relationship. **The answer is C: friends with Jordan** - its the natural continuation of the helping behavior pattern, reflecting how prosocial actions strengthen social bonds. Would you like to explore how this behavioral pattern might play out in different contexts, perhaps relating it to specific volunteer coordination scenarios youve encountered?

How would you describe Remy? A. relieved B. like winner C. do well Assistant: gemini-1.5-flash Lets analyze the options, focusing on precision and avoiding assumptions about Remys internal state (to respect Tomokos preference for non-judgmental tone): **Option A: Relieved** This implies Remy felt anxiety or stress before the retest. While possible, we dont have information to confirm this. Its an inference, and Tomoko prefers more explicit connections (Inference Comfort: 3). Therefore, this option is less precise. **Option B: Like winner** This is also an inference. second test doesnt automatically equate to victory. Remy might have improved their score, but not necessarily \"won.\" This is too subjective and doesnt align with Tomokos preference for precise language (Definition Precision: 5). **Option C: Do well** This is the most accurate and neutral option. It simply states potential outcome without making assumptions about Remys feelings or the tests context. Its precise and avoids unnecessary inferences. **Step-by-Step Conclusion:** 1. **Option and B** both rely on inferences about Remys emotional state. These inferences are not explicitly supported by the provided information. 2. **Option C** is factual statement about potential outcome. It aligns perfectly with Tomokos preferences for precision, neutrality, and systematic approach. **Therefore, the best description of Remy is C: do well.** This is the most accurate and least speculative response, aligning perfectly with Tomokos personality and learning preferences.
