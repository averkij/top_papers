This multifaceted interaction highlights the intertwined nature of perception and response in human experience. As specialized area within Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, multimodal Learning focuses on creating systems capable of understanding and generating various multimodal information [16]. paradigm shift has emerged in the field of AI across multiple modalities, transitioning from specialized unimodal models trained for single task to versatile multimodal ones dealing with diverse array of tasks [150]. This shift is largely attributed to the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field such as GPT-3 [34], ChatGPT [300] and LLaMA [378], which unify multiple natural language understanding and generation tasks with single Next Token Prediction (NTP) objective. The original task of NTP is to predict the next token (which can be word, subword, or character) in given sequence of text based on the context provided by preceding tokens. The NTP paradigm has been proven to be scalable given abundant data and computational resources in the lens of scaling law research [192, 472]. Simultaneously, researchers have explored the incorporation of non-textual input and output modalities into large language models, sparking interest within the community to develop powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) featuring capabilities to conduct tasks across different modalities [72, 448]. For better understanding of the historical development of LMMs based on NTP, we demonstrate timeline in Figure 1, categorized by models understanding or generation ability and different modalities. In Figure 2, we use the image modality as an example to illustrate the workflow of Multimodal Learning with NTP (MMNTP). The process can be divided into three key components: Tokenization, Modeling, and Training Objectives, which will be explained and discussed in details in the rest of the survey. For vision modality, image and video understanding capabilities have been demonstrated in large vision-language models such as GPT4-V [301], QwenVL [12], LLaVA [254], phi 3.5-Vision [1] and Gemini [370], while Emu [363] and Chameleon [369] show visual generation could be achieved in NTP manner. Similarly, end-to-end audio understanding and generation have been achieved in NTP-based models such as GPT4-o and Moshi [105, 302]. To equip LLMs with visual understanding capabilities, pioneering research such as Flamingo [3], BLIP2 [227], GPT4V [301], MiniGPT4 [509] and LLaVA [254] has demonstrated that LLMs can be easily adapted to process multimodal inputs such as images and videos, by converting multimodal information into tokens with straightforward tokenization module, such as visual encoder like CLIP [321] or simple linear projection [18]. Subsequently, these models perform multimodal instruction tuning based on image-query-answer triples using the same NTP objective. Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 3 As Large Language Models bridge understanding and generation tasks in natural language processing, there is considerable interest in extending their capabilities to generate multimodal outputs. Recent advances in this direction include GPT-4o [302], which can understand and generate text, audio, and images using unified multimodal LLM. We have also witnessed tremendous improvements from the open source community. For visual modality, Chameleon [369] and Emu3 [400] are two distinctive multimodal that unify understanding and generation in both language and image modalities. For audio, Moshi [105] can conduct tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech generation in an NTP manner based pretrained LLM. As general and fundamental approach, NTP also has promising implications for diverse fields like AI-for-Science such as designing proteins in biology [20] and composing molecule structure in chemistry [118]. To generate multimodal content using the NTP approach, it is crucial to recognize that unlike language, which is structured from discrete symbols, multimodal data like images and sounds inherently exist in continuous space. common technique to address this challenge is quantization. Vector Quantization (VQ) is classical method that allows for the modeling of probability density functions for continuous multimodal data through discrete vector distributions [138, 306]. This technique aligns well with NTP modeling. With the rise of deep learning, neural VQ methods such as VQVAE [385] and VQGAN [112] have been developed, establishing foundation for linking visual and audio generation with NTP. Significant work has emerged leveraging these VQ methodologies and the language modeling task. Examples include innovative systems such as DALL-E [327], CogView [91], CM3Leon [458], Parti [452], Muse [43], VideoPoet [199], LVM [13], Chameleon [369] and Infinity [149]. These methods often rely on external models, like VQGAN decoders, for image generation, making their approach form of indirect multimodal generation. Parallel explorations have been conducted utilizing the NTP objective to directly generate images in continuous spaces, such as VAEs latent space [381], or by simulating diffusion process [233, 507]. Unlike the indirect methods, only few initiatives like ImageGPT [55] perform direct multimodal generation by predicting pixels from scratch. Additionally, NTP models can be augmented with various external models to facilitate multimodal generation. Notable examples include Emu [362], MiniGPT5 [506], and CoDi2 [368]. These approaches utilize the NTP framework to incorporate external diffusion models for image generation, showcasing another form of indirect multimodal generation. We have covered powerful models that can understand or generate information across different modalities within the NTP paradigm. However, developing single model that can both comprehend and produce information across multiple modalities, similar to human abilities, remains an intriguing goal in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, new research trend has emerged, focusing on the development of LMMs that unifies multimodal understanding and generation in the NTP paradigm. Notable examples include Unified-IO [269, 270], Chameleon [369], Transfusion [507], Show-o [422], Moshi [106], and Emu3 [401]. Unifying understanding and generation presents unique challenges, including the diversity of modalities and resolving conflicts between them. We will discuss these issues further in Section 6."

            "content": "Discrete tokenization performs quantization on the latent space, utilizing fixed-size, discrete space similar to the vocabulary of language models. In contrast, continuous tokenization does not involve quantization, resulting in much larger representation space. Discrete. In Equation 1, discrete token implies that the representation space 𝑍 𝑓 comprises finite number of discrete symbols. The output space is called the codebook 𝐶 = {𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑁 }, where 𝑐𝑖 R0, and each representation 𝑧 is composed of codes from this codebook, i.e., 𝑧 = {𝑧1, 𝑧2, ..., 𝑧𝑛 } with 𝑧𝑖 𝐶. Language tokens are inherently discrete because they originate from finite vocabulary. Each word or subword unit is mapped to unique token from this predefined set. In contrast, modalities such as audio and images exist in continuous, high-dimensional spaces. To process these modalities within the same framework (i.e., NTP) as for discrete language tokens, they need to be transformed into discrete representation. Quantization is process that maps values from continuous space to discrete space, typically resulting in much smaller representation space. It is default operation when discrete representation is desired for tokenizing multimodal information. Quantization is often combined with auto-encoder techniques to reduce the size of the latent space. Typical examples include VQ-series tokenizers such as VQVAE [138] and VQGAN [112], which inherently feature discrete representations. Details of the quantization process are introduced in Section 2.2. Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 7 Table 2.

In contrast to discrete tokenization, continuous tokenization represents data using continuous space where tokens are derived directly from the datas inherent properties without enforcing quantization into predefined codebook. In this approach, the representation space 𝑍 𝑓 is not limited to finite set of predetermined codes; rather, it preserves the continuous nature of the data. Each token 𝑧 is sampled from continuous distribution, allowing for more nuanced and flexible representation that can capture the subtleties of the input data. Continuous tokenization is particularly advantageous for modalities that naturally exist in continuous form and require rich representational capacity to capture their complex patterns. For instance, in audio and visual data, continuous representations can effectively retain fine-grained temporal and spatial information that might be lost during discrete tokenization. Features of Tokenizers. Before diving into different tokenization techniques, we summarize 2.1.2 the basic two features (Representation and Reconstruction) that an ideal multimodal tokenizer should possess to achieve better understanding and generation capabilities in the NTP framework. 8 Chen et al. Fig. 5. Illustrations of the training method of tokenizers. Representation Ability: Effective representation encodes semantically relevant information into the latent space 𝑍 while removing redundant information. This is crucial for various downstream tasks that learn conditional probability 𝑃 (𝑌 𝑋 ) over the label space 𝑌 , conditioned on the multimodal input space 𝑋 , by replacing it with 𝑃 (𝑌 𝑍 ). Prominent tokenizers known for better representation include language-guided contrastive learning methods such as CLIP [321] and fully self-supervised methods like DINO [40]. Reconstruction Ability: For generating multimodal information, it is expected that the tokenization function 𝑓 is invertible or nearly invertible, meaning there is detokenization function 𝑔 that can recover the original input from the representation space, satisfying 𝑔(𝑓 (𝑥)) = 𝑥 or 𝑔(𝑓 (𝑥)) 𝑥. Notable works that excel in reconstruction include Auto-Encoder (AE) series models such as Variational Auto-Encoder [195] (VAE) and VQVAE [138]. It is important to note that these abilities are not mutually exclusive; their balance depends on the training techniques used."

The training methodologies for tokenizers can be catego-\nrized into four groups, based on their respective training objectives: Auto-Encoding, Denoising\nAuto-Encoding, Supervised Training, and Contrastive Learning, as depicted in Figure 5. Herein, we\nprovide a summary of the core concepts associated with various tokenizers.",
            "content": "Auto-Encoding. Auto-Encoder (AE) is type of artificial neural network designed to learn efficient data representations. It consists of two main components: an encoder, which maps input data to latent space with reduced dimensions, and decoder, which reconstructs the input data from this latent representation. The training goal for an Auto-Encoder is to minimize the reconstruction error, ensuring the decoded output closely resembles the original input. Variants like Variational Auto-Encoders [195] (VAEs) use probabilistic approaches to generate more robust and informative embeddings. In multimodal generation models, tokenizers trained with auto-encoder methodologies are used to restore the multimodal input from the latent representation. special case is diffusion models [90], which can also be viewed as an Auto-Encoder, enabling generation in Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 9 non-autoregressive manner [233]. Discrete tokens are typically generated by quantizing [335] the continuous data representation within the latent space of auto-encoders. Denoising Auto-Encoding. Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) builds on the basic auto-encoder concept by introducing noise into the input data and training the model to reconstruct the original, noise-free version. This approach encourages the model to learn robust features capable of handling data corruption, thereby improving its generalization capabilities. In transformer-based models, common technique known as Masked Language Modeling [84] involves masking parts of the input tokens and training the model to predict them, which can be viewed as special type of denoising auto-encoder. This method has become mainstream across various modalities, popularized in language by BERT [84], in vision by BEiT [17] and MAE [153], and in audio by HuBERT [160]. Supervised Pretraining. Some tokenizers are pretrained on specific tasks using supervised learning, aiming to acquire task-specific representations through labeled datasets. These models are initially trained on large-scale datasets to capture specific features of the input data. In the vision modality, supervised tasks include semantic segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation. Models trained for these tasks, such as SAM [196, 392], ViTDet [240], and MiDaS [329], are later used in LMMs as tokenizers, like in DeepSeek-VL [268] and Cambrain-1 [376], to extract diverse visual features from input data. In the audio modality, Whisper [322] is trained with 680,000 hours of labeled audio data in weakly supervised manner. Thanks to its robust and powerful speech feature extraction capabilities, Whisper is widely used in Speech LLMs [65, 162, 366] for extracting speech embeddings. Contrastive Learning. Contrastive Learning is self-supervised learning method that focuses on learning representations by distinguishing between positive and negative pairs. The core idea is to bring similar (positive) examples closer together in the representation space while pushing dissimilar (negative) examples further apart. The items in each pair can belong to the same or different modalities. For example, DINO [40] uses image-image pairs to enhance vision representation, while CLIP [321] employs text-image pairs to improve language alignment within vision representation. Currently, LMMs that only feature multimodal understanding capabilities, such as InstructBLIP [74] and LLaVA [254], opt for tokenizers with superior representation abilities like CLIP [321], as they do not require reconstruction of the multimodal information. Conversely, LMMs supporting multimodal generation capabilities tend to choose VQVAE as the tokenizer, exemplified by models like Unified-IO [271], Chameleon [369], Emu3 [401], among others [128, 396, 405]."

The primary objective of vector quantization is to reconstruct all the information in the original data as accurately as possible with finite set of vectors, which is also called the codebook. Vanilla VQ. The original VQVAE proposed by van den Oord et al. [385] is milestone of many successive vector quantization methods. As shown in Figure 6, VQVAE consists of three main components: the encoder, the quantizer, and the decoder. The encoder comprises the input data to compact latent space, the quantizer select the nearest code vectors from the finite codebook to approximate the continuous latents, the decoder reconstruct the input data using the discrete codes. When training the VQVAE, three main loss components are crucial: reconstruction loss, codebook loss, and commitment loss [385]. The reconstruction loss, often implemented as mean squared error or binary cross-entropy, ensures accurate data reconstruction by minimizing differences between input and output. Codebook loss, or vector quantization loss, enables effective encoding by aligning encoder outputs with nearest codebook entries, ensuring discrete latent variables. Meanwhile, commitment loss acts as regularizer, encouraging encoder outputs to stay close to codebook entries to maintain stable learning, preventing erratic mapping. As gradient can not pass the quantization operator (finding the nearest code), the straight-through estimator [21] is adopted to let the gradient flow normally. Recent advancements in vector quantization methods have focused on achieving better image reconstruction and enhancing generative capabilities. To improve reconstruction quality, both architectural innovations and codebook designs have been proposed. Transformer-based frameworks, such as ViT-VQGAN [450], Swin-MAE [433], Swin-Unet [38], and Efficient-VQGAN [39], replace traditional CNN encoders and decoders with more robust modules like ViT [96] and Swin-Transformer [264, 265], leading to better feature representations and reconstruction fidelity. Additionally, several methods such as LFQ [456] and FSQ [291] are proposed to address the significant challenge of codebook collapse during codebook learning, where large portion of code embeddings are not used when enlarging the codebook size, causing redundancy in the Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 11 codebook and limiting the expressive power of the generative model [19]. For improved generative performance and efficiency, several approaches have been introduced. Tian et al. [374] propose Visual Autoregressive modeling, which facilitates image generation through \"next-scale prediction\", moving away from the traditional raster-scan \"next-token prediction\" used in standard VQVAEbased models. RQ-Transformer [216] employs residual quantization (RQ) to precisely approximate feature maps and reduce spatial resolution. RQ helps the RQ-Transformer to significantly reduce computational costs and effectively learn long-range interactions in inputs. RAR [459] introduces randomness annealing strategy with permuted objective, enhancing the models ability to learn bidirectional contexts while retaining the autoregressive framework. TiTok [461] tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences, providing more compact latent representation that is substantially more efficient and effective than conventional techniques. It greatly reduces the number of tokens required to encode an image compared to previous methods [39, 450]. VQ with Auxiliary Losses. The primary goal of the vanilla VQVAE is to accurately reconstruct input data by minimizing the mean squared error loss. However, this auto-encoding objective doesnt always align with human perception of the quality of reconstructed data. For example, in the visual modality, the vanilla MSE loss often results in images with blurred details, particularly in human faces [210]. To address this issue, several approaches introduce higher-level training objectives aimed at improving the overall quality of the output data. In the realm of vision, perceptual loss [188] is widely used to enhance the quality of reconstructed images by leveraging pre-trained CNN. VQGAN [39] incorporates discriminator network to enhance image fidelity by adding an adversarial training objective. The role of the discriminator is to discern between the reconstructed and original images, while the VQ-VAE is optimized to deceive the discriminator, thereby improving the quality of the reconstructed images. In the audio modality, it is essential to decouple the audio into its acoustic and semantic components to achieve both powerful audio reconstruction quality and LLM modeling. SpeechTokenizer [486] and Mimi [78] introduce the loss of semantic distillation at the first layer of Residual VQ, using self-supervised models, such as HuBERT [160] and WavLM [56]. Residual Vector Quantization. Residual vector quantization (RVQ) has been used for image [217] and audio [468] generation, where quantized codes are refined by storing additional quantized residuals. Lee et al. [216] propose the RQVAE that also introduces residual quantization to recursively quantize the feature map in coarse-to-fine manner, employing fixed-size codebook to maintain both precision and code diversity. Product Quantization. El-Nouby et al. [108] propose product quantization (PQ), to factor the codebook into product of smaller codebooks, allowing for high-quality quantizers without the requirement of intractably large codebooks. Multi-scale Quantization. Tian et al. [374] introduce the Visual Autoregressive modeling (VAR), which develops multi-scale quantization autoencoder that encodes images into 𝐾 multi-scale discrete token maps using shared codebook. It aids the model in generating images through \"next-scale prediction,\" instead of the raster-scan \"next-token prediction\" typically used in standard VQVAE-based models. The multi-scale quantization enables the model to learn visual distributions and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. Finite Scalar Quantization. To generate concise and expressive tokens using larger token vocabulary and avoid codebook collapse, Mentzer et al. [291] propose finite scalar quantization (FSQ). FSQ projects the VAE representation down to few dimensions that can be quantized into fixed values, creating an implicit codebook. Look-up Free Quantization. LFQ [457] reduces the embedding dimension of the codebook to zero, effectively replacing the codebook with an integer set. It allows VQVAE to improve the quality of 12 Chen et al. image reconstruction and generation by vastly increasing the vocabulary size by magnitudes. For example, the rFID on Imagenet decreases from 2.5 to 1.4 when the LFQ vocabulary size increases from 210 to 216 on ImageNet dataset. Embedding-Free Quantization. Maskbit [406] explores an embedding-free tokenization approach that utilizes binary quantization. It projects latent embeddings into dimensions and then quantizes them based on their sign values to produce bit token representations. The generated bit tokens exhibit highly structured semantic representations, which are crucial for generation tasks. Group Vector Quantization. Unlike RVQ which models the information residually, Group Vector Quantization models the information across different dimensions. In the audio domain, HiFiCodec [439] proposes group-residual vector quantization technique to reduce the number of codebooks, while FACodec [189] disentangles speech into prosody information, content information, and acoustic details using three-factorized vector quantizers."

Generation ability assesses the models capacity to generate new, plausible samples from the learned distribution in the codebook space. This metric evaluates the creativity and diversity of the VQVAE in producing new data that is consistent with the training data distribution. To quantitatively evaluate generation ability, metrics such as the Inception Score (IS) and generation Fréchet Inception Distance (gFID) [157] are often used. rFIDs are often computed between ImageNet validation images and their reconstructed images. gFIDs are usually computed against the training set with ADMs evaluation suite [86]."

            "content": "Image. Images can be tokenized into discrete symbols with the previously introduced VQVAE 2.3.1 structure. Compared to text tokens, images diverge in three fundamental aspects that significantly impact how they should be tokenized: 1. Rich Information Granularity: Unlike text, which primarily encapsulates high-level semantic meaning, images are contain with myriad of perceptual details. These encompass low-level visual elements such as colors, shapes, and textures, alongside more abstract concepts like objects and actions. 2. Dense Information: Images inhabit densely packed representational realm, where each pixel, across multiple dimensions including height, width, and color channels (RGB being common example), carries information. This stands in stark contrast to the discreteness of text in nature, characterized by sequentially arranged words. Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 13 3. Two-Dimensional Spatial Structure: Images are inherently structured in two dimensions, spread across grid defined by height and width. This 2D layout differs fundamentally from the straightforward, one-dimensional sequence that characterizes textual data, introducing unique complexities in their processing and analysis. Given these differences, bridging the gap between text and image modalities in the training of LLMs based on discrete image tokens requires robust image tokenizer, which must balance the fusion of sufficient alignment with LLMs language ability (referred to as representation), the retention of rich original image information (referred to as reconstruction), and the efficient use of tokens given the growing inference cost of transformer decoder (referred to as token efficiency). These factors possess trade-off [127, 128, 357, 456], making it crucial for the construction of an image tokenizer to maintain equilibrium among these factors. In terms of better representation, models like ViT [96] are commonly employed, often aligned with text encoder through contrastive loss [312, 321], or aligned with text modalities through generative loss [451]. Additionally, modules like Q-Former [227] can also be used for image feature transformation [128, 227]. Consequently, the resultant image features integrate higher-level semantics and gradually compress high-dimensional images into lower-dimensional representations aligned with text. While the initial arrangement of image patches follows raster order, preserving intrinsic sequential relationships, this configuration lacks causal semantics, posing challenges for language modeling. Regarding reconstruction ability, an image decoder is often layered atop the image encoder to reconstruct the original image from its representation, incorporating reconstruction loss into the training process [112, 128, 187, 309]. Training labels typically use the original images, but with advancements in diffusion models, more research is incorporating latents for diffusion models as reconstruction labels [128, 187]. For token efficiency, modules like selectors or mergers for image tokens are utilized to truncate their length (i.e., the number of tokens per image). For instance, SEED-LLaMA [128] compresses longer image features encoded by ViT into 32 continuous tokens using Causal Q-Former and then discretizes them through quantization. LaViT [187] first predicts whether each patch token should be selected using shared MLP, and then compresses the image length by employing selected patches as queries and unselected patches as keys and values in cross-attention blocks [128]. Beyond these aspects, some studies also focus on the unique properties of specific image types or tasks. For example, VQ-IMG aims to enhance the modeling capabilities of image tokenizers for faces [124], while LVM integrates tasks like segmentation and object detection during the training of models based on VQGAN to enrich the representation of image tokens [13]. StrokeNVWA introduces VQ-Stroke method to discretize vector graphic images into stroke tokens [367]."

            "content": "As traditional companding algorithm, 𝜇-law/A-law algorithm is commonly employed in speech generative models such as WaveNet [383]. While this algorithm projects each audio frame to an 8-bit value, it does not reduce the sampling rate, thereby preserving overlong sequences. Self-supervised learned models have shown exceptional performance in various speech-related tasks, sparking interest in clustering their speech representations for speech quantization. The vq-wav2vec [10] uses either Gumbel-Softmax or online k-means clustering to quantize the SSL-learned dense 14 Chen et al. representation. HuBERT [160] is trained with masked prediction task, whose targets are obtained through k-means clustering of learned features from earlier iterations. Utilizing quantized tokens learned with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), GSLM [207] and VQTTS [99] demonstrate faster speed in speech generation tasks compared with WaveNet. Because SSL tokens are extracted with highly abstracted semantics while discarding low-level acoustic information, the reconstruction quality is relatively low, and speaker identity is lost [28]. Neural codec models typically apply VQ-VAE on the raw audios with residual vector quantization, exemplified by SoundStream [467] and EnCodec [104]. They are originally designed for audio compression, have the capability to encode waveforms into discrete codes and faithfully reconstruct them back into high-quality waveforms. Recently, they are widely used in audio generation models such as AudioLM [28], VALLE [391] and their variants [148, 354, 397], and reach new state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Compared with traditional 𝜇-law/A-law algorithms, codec models can efficiently reduce the length of token sequences. It can also maintain multi-scale acoustic information indicating speaker identity compared with highly-abstracted SSL-learned discrete tokens such as HuBERT [160] tokens. Additionally, the codec models are typically off-the-shelf and lightweight. Latest works have attempted to impose additional supervision on the discrete codes extracted by codec models. The objective is to enhance their ability to extract and encode higher-level semantic information, thereby improving language modeling. SpeechTokenizer [486] is an RVQ-based codec model, where its first-layer codebook incorporates semantic information through the semantic distillation process, using HuBERT [160] representations as the semantic teacher. Mimi, used by Moshi [105], further improves upon this by replacing the semantic teacher from HuBERT with WavLM [56]. Additionally, it isolates the first-layer codebook from the RVQ process to achieve better semantic and acoustic disentanglement. To enhance the compression rate, WavTokenizer [178] is capable of quantizing one-second audio into 75 or 40 tokens with single quantizer."

There are two additional desirable features for video tokenizer: (1) Joint Image-Video Tokenization. The MAGVIT series [456] enables tokenizing images and videos with shared vocabulary. To achieve this, the number of frames in an input video, 𝑇 , must satisfy 𝑇 = 1 +𝑛 𝐹𝑇 , meaning the video comprises an initial frame followed by 𝑛 clips, each containing 𝐹𝑇 frames. When 𝑛 = 0, the video contains only the initial frame, thus simplifying the video to an image.

However, their dense feature encapsulation makes direct mapping to fixed vocabulary challenging, unlike discrete tokens. It poses challenge for LLMs aiming to comprehend and generate such information in NTP manner. To handle continuous multimodal token inputs for LLM to understand, transformations or adapters are necessary to balance data representation and text alignment. For multimodal generation, modifying the output head to align with non-textual modality specific decoders input feature space is also crucial.

            "content": "Encoding. The encoding of non-textual modality data aims to capture meaningful features and important nuances that are essential for the understanding of the data. This can be achieved through different types of encoders such as Transformer-based encoders [227, 253, 254, 321, 509] 16 Chen et al. or CNN-based encoders [3, 88, 183, 492]. Theres also an option to go encoder-free [18, 194], which allows for raw data to be fed directly into the model. Transformer-based encoders are widely used for their robust representation capabilities and generalizability [96, 386]. For non-textual modality sample, the input is initially divided into patches and transformed into 1D sequence, with each patch represented as soft token. This sequence is then processed through the Transformers encoder layers, employing self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between patches. Consequently, the model produces rich representation of the input. Typically, there are two types of encoders: (1) unimodal encoders, designed to process information from single modality [6, 17, 96, 196, 242, 260, 265, 487]; and (2) multi-modal encoders, capable of integrating information from multiple modalities [110, 132, 294, 295, 321, 360, 451]. For instance, PaLM-E [97], Unified-IO-2 [269], and PaLI [58] use ViT [96] encoders trained solely on visual data. Conversely, LLaVA [254], Emu [357, 362], and Qwen-VL [12] utilize CLIP [321] or EVA-CLIP [360] encoders with contrastive loss to align textual and non-textual representations. NExT-GPT [417], CoDi-2 [368], and BuboGPT [502] employ ImageBind [132] as their non-textual encoder, aligning various modalities like audio, text, and heat maps with image representations. In comparison, CNN-based encoders are less frequently used but remain vital due to their flexibility in image resolution generalization [454, 456] and ability to capture local features [183]. For example, DaVinCi [88] uses ResNet [154] as the visual encoder. Flamingo [3] utilizes NFNet [30], normalizer-free ResNet, for image encoding. Beyond encoders, Fuyu-8B [18] directly processes raw image patches after single linear projection to accommodate images of varying resolutions and aspect ratios, similar to ViLT [194]. However, Fuyu-8B adds the flexibility of an any-resolution setting using decoder-only model, benefiting from architectural simplicity but showing reduced downstream performance compared to encoder-based models. Moreover, ImageGPT [55] trains decoder-only generative model on raw image pixel sequences, which, despite its effectiveness in image generation and understanding, requires significant computational resources and is limited to low-resolution images. Input Alignment. After encoding non-textual modality data, we obtain meaningful representation. However, this representation often lacks alignment with the textual embedding space of large language models, leading to failure in properly understanding these inputs. Although multi-modal encoders like CLIP [321] have made strides in narrowing the gap, they still encounter two significant challenges: (1) the presence of redundant continuous tokens [3, 176, 227]; and (2) lack of contextual semantics, such as causal semantics, because they are typically trained only with image-caption paired data rather than image-text interleaved data or image-prompt instructional data [127, 214, 370, 512]. Therefore, it is crucial to establish connection between the representation space of non-textual modality data and the LLM textual embedding space. There are typically two approaches to construct such bridge: (1) Slot-based Resampler [3, 227]; and (2) Projection [12, 18, 253, 254]. The Slot-based Resampler compresses redundant non-textual modality tokens from the encoding stage into fewer learned query vectors, known as slots. This is typically accomplished using multiple Transformer blocks with cross-attention mechanism. For instance, BLIP-2 [227] employs QFormer and linear projection to bridge the image encoder with the LLM backbone. The Q-Former blocks consist of self-attention layer on the learned queries, cross-attention layer between the encoded image representation and the learned queries, and feed-forward layer. Initially, it is trained for image-text matching, image-text contrastive learning, and image-grounded text generation, followed by training for next token prediction with the frozen LLM backbone. Another model using this approach is Flamingo [3], which utilizes Perceiver Resampler [176] to compress Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 17 byte arrays into latent vectors in modality-agnostic manner. Specifically, Perceiver [176] employs multiple cascaded attention mechanisms: the latents act as queries and initially cross-attend to keys and values calculated from the byte array (e.g., an image), followed by processing with self-attention block, iterating several times. PerceiverIO [175] enhances this with an additional cross-attention block between an output query array and the slots (i.e., the latents). The Hierarchical Perceiver [41] decomposes the input array into multiple groups, compresses each group, and merges the resulting latents to obtain the output array. Compared to slot-based resampler, projection is much simpler in architecture, involving only single linear projection [18, 254] or an Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) [253]. For instance, LLaVA [254] employs linear projection to convert encoded image representations into the language embedding space. Similarly, Fuyu-8B [18] projects raw image patches onto the embedding space. LLaVA-1.5 [253] enhances LLaVA by substituting the linear projection with an MLP. There are also other approaches to connect the non-textual modality encoder with the LLM backbone. For example, Emu [362] leverages Causal Transformer (i.e., C-Former) to convert the image tokens autoregressively; Emu2 [357] replaces the C-Former with mean pooling followed by linear projection."

We refer to this objective as positioning. There are typically two methods to achieve this: (1) using placeholders [198, 417, 506]; and (2) employing non-textual modality begin-of-sentence (BOS) token [95, 357, 362]. Firstly, special tokens can be introduced as placeholders for non-textual modality data. For instance, Mini-GPT5 [506] and GILL [198] utilize sequence of image placeholder tokens ranging from [IMG1] to [IMGr], which can be interleaved with textual tokens, and these tokens are added to the models vocabulary. Likewise, NExT-GPT [417] uses 5 image placeholder tokens, along with 9 audio and 25 video placeholder tokens. Secondly, the use of single BOS token (sometimes accompanied by an EOS token) can simplify the process by signaling the position of non-textual modality data. For example, DreamLLM [95] employs special <dream> token to mark the start of modality switching, allowing single model run to process sequence of queries. Emu [362] and Emu2 [357] use both image BOS and EOS tokens to encase encoded image features. In addition to focusing on positioning, models must also learn to generate accurate features for non-textual modalities. Typically, the output layers of large language models (LLMs) feature classification heads for discrete token decoding, an objective we refer to as output representation. To enable continuous token outputs, modifications to these output layers are required. Generally, there are three approaches: (1) adapting the original language modeling head to be regressive [357, 18 Chen et al. 362]; (2) introducing new head for dense outputs [95]; and (3) utilizing the final hidden states before the language model head [198, 506]. Output Alignment. Typically, generated continuous tokens cannot be directly used for multimodal generation because they dont align with the input features of multimodal decoders like LDM [336] and AudioLDM [252]. To address this, additional modules are introduced to convert these tokens into representations suitable for multimodal decoders, ultimately generating the final non-textual modality data. For instance, NExT-GPT [417] employs Transformer-based output projection, while Mini-GPT5 [506] and GILL [198] utilize Q-Former-like architecture [227] consisting of Transformer encoder and decoder to transform continuous tokens into conditional latent features for the Stable Diffusion Model.

Prismer [260], for instance, introduces features beyond traditional RGB patches, such as depth and normal patchification. These features are compressed with shared experts resampler before being integrated by unified image encoder. SAM-CLIP [392] leverages SAM [196] and the CLIP text encoder for distillation training, boosting the semantic and spatial comprehension of the image encoder. (2) Resolution and Aspect Ratio: This strategy includes support for high-resolution images, multiresolution capabilities, and arbitrary aspect ratios [18, 79, 152, 430, 447]. For example, Fuyu [18] uses raw pixels as image encoding inputs for the LLM backbone via linear projection, employing special image newline token for delineating raster-ordered patches. This enables support for various resolutions and aspect ratios. MS-ViT [152] suggests varying patchification based on image region complexity, introducing gate mechanism to mark tokens needing finer patchification, which then undergoes encoding after position encoding interpolation. (3) Heterogeneous Images: This includes encoding methods for specific image types like vector images, diagrams, charts, and PDFs [263, 431, 447]. Document images, for example, require detailed observation, as seen in TextMonkey [263], which splits large document images into smaller subimages. Each sub-image is encoded individually, and trainable shifted attention layers are added post-frozen ViT layers for interactive representation across sub-images.

To obtain general speech features, wav2vec 2.0 [11] masks speech input in the latent space and addresses contrastive task defined over quantized latent representations that are learned simultaneously. data2vec [9] biases the query-key attention scores with penalty proportional to their distance. HuBERT [160] employs an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for BERT-like prediction loss, which is applied solely on the masked regions. WavLM [56] introduces denoising in pretraining, jointly with regular masked speech prediction, as HuBERT. Whisper [322] is speech recognition model characterized by an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture, trained on web-scale labeled speech data. It is increasingly being employed as foundational speech model, extending its applications beyond speech recognition tasks [162, 287, 288, 366]. For continuous tokenization of audio, AST [134] uses convolution-free pure-transformer architecture to extract features for audio classification, drawing insights from ViT [96]. Inspired by CLIP [321], CLAP [110] introduces contrastive language-audio pre-training task to learn textenhanced audio representations using supervised audio and text pairs. Fine-tuned based on pretrained CLIP model, Wav2CLIP [412] and AudioCLIP [146] incorporate an additional audio encoder using supervised pairs of audio and class labels. Audio-MAE [165] adopts Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework to learn audio representations. Similar to MAE, it uses reconstruction pre-training task where the decoder is tasked with reconstructing masked patches from the encoded information of the unmasked patches. BEATs [57] introduces self-distilled tokenizer that converts continuous audio signals into discrete labels, facilitating classic mask and discrete label prediction pre-training."

            "content": "In the case of post-temporal fusion, models such as CLIP4Clip [276] and CLIPBERT [220] first independently encode each frame using an image encoder. They then employ lightweight pooling, convolution, and attention mechanisms to temporally fuse the features from all frames. The advantage of this approach lies in its ability to leverage pre-trained image encoders, thereby reducing the computational overhead associated with adapting to video data. However, significant drawback is its limited capacity to adequately model features in the temporal dimension. On the other hand, full spatial-temporal fusion models, like Temporal 3D ConvNets [89], VideoMAE [377], and ViViT [6], utilize 3D convolutions or 3D attention structures, allowing for comprehensive interaction among inputs in the spatio-temporal dimension. This enables better modeling of dynamic changes in temporal order, effectively capturing the motion of objects and backgrounds. However, this approach requires substantial 3D computation, prompting common strategies such as decoupling temporal and spatial self-attention [22, 332] and implementing sparse 3D attention [247] to enhance computational efficiency. Recent advancements, such as TimeChat [333] and NumPro [419], have explored the integration of timestamp information into continuous video tokens, facilitating explicit time-vision associations for improved temporal grounding and reasoning. 20 Chen et al.

Step 3. Decode the predicted tokens into the space of their respective modalities. Fig. 9 also showcases the key modules of the NTP-based multimodal model, including tokenizers (encoders) and de-tokenizers (decoders) for each modality, as well as the multimodal Transformer. The tokenizer (encoder) and de-tokenizer (decoder) modules often appear together and are pretrained using unimodal data through techniques such as reconstruction. They have the capability to split the original input into tokens using the tokenizer (encoder) and restore the tokens back to their original form using the de-tokenizer (decoder). Once all the tokenizers (encoders) and de-tokenizers (decoders) for each modality are pretrained, we can activate the required tokenizer (encoder) separately for tokenization of input containing multiple modalities, enabling us to obtain multimodal token sequence. Finally, these multimodal token sequences are fed into the multimodal Transformer for NTP training. For multimodal Transformers, we can use different attention masks to control the flow of information from different modalities [373, 422]. As shown in Fig 10, common attention mask is the causal mask, which requires each token to only depend on preceding context for generation. However, certain tasks require generating subsequent text conditioned on content-rich input prefix, such as generating summaries based on rich-text-format document. For such tasks, we can also utilize non-causal mask, which applies bidirectional attention to the prefix, allowing the context within the prefix to interdepend and provide better representation, while using causal attention for autoregressive generation of the content to be generated. In summary, we can flexibly select attention masks based on the requirements of the task."

Unified models handle multimodal understanding and reasoning within single backbone model, whereas compositional models assign different tasks to specialized external models. Although NTP has transformed language intelligence, its impact on multimodal intelligence remains uncertain. Given this context, unified models are closer to multimodal foundation model [224, 401] due to its end-to-end nature and it may hold more potential than their compositional counterparts, as they rely on single NTP training objective, making them easier to scale compared to multi-module systems. We will discuss the scaling behavior of MMNTP models in Section 6.1. Training Efficiency. Compositional models benefit from leveraging highly specialized external encoders and decoders, often resulting in reduced training time for new tasks since these components are pretrained separately. This modular approach allows for targeted updates, reusing existing powerful models without the need for extensive retraining of the entire system. In contrast, unified models leave most of the understanding and generation responsibility to one backbone model, leading to sub-optimal performance given the same amount of computation [422]. This integrated training can be more resource-intensive, but it potentially facilitates more coherent feature space across modalities within the LLM backbone, potentially enhancing overall performance on diverse multimodal tasks. Deployment Efficiency. The unified model, particularly when using quantization-based methods, demonstrates significantly superior deployment efficiency compared to the compositional approach. single unified transformer decoder backbone can effectively leverage the advanced techniques developed by the LLM community for accelerating both training and inference, such as FlashAttention [75] and vLLM [205].

It leverages the powerful reasoning ability and world knowledge of LLMs to support various multimodal understanding tasks without re-pretraining the model. Enlarging the output token space to discrete multimodal tokens 𝑉𝑀 like quantization codes would enable multimodal generation ability. In this approach, multimodal contents are first converted into discrete tokens, utilizing cross-entropy loss as the loss function. major line of works is auto-regressive multimodal information generation, such as DALLE [327], CogView [91], UnifiedIO [271], LVM [13] and Video-Poet [199]. Merging the two output spaces (𝑉𝑇 and 𝑉𝑀 ) into one model is an intriguing direction [257, 270, 271], which naturally unifies multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, some related research [489] shows that learning to predict text tokens have no benifit for predicting multimdoal tokens and sometimes lead to strong conflict. Under the NTP training framework, whether multimodal generation helps understanding ability also remains unclear. Consequently, effectively integrating the output spaces of text and multimodal tokens presents itself as one of the main challenges in the domain, underscoring the need for innovative and scalable approaches to harness the full potential of NTP models in the realm of multimodal learning. variant of standard next token prediction is to predict multiple tokens at one time, disobeying the causal order. Recent researches [44, 374, 456] have found that parallel prediction is more effective for visual domains such as images and videos than simple raster-based prediction, which predicts the image tokens from left to right and top to down. MaskGIT [44] and MAGVIT [456] predict portion of tokens at each prediction step according to dynamic confidence threshold. VAR [374] predicts the visual tokens in resolution-autoregressive manner, which predicts tokens in the same resolution in parallel and predict low-to-high images in sequential.

After the modality alignment training, different modality 4.3.1 inputs now can be represented in unified embedding space for the backbone LLM to perform complex tasks. Instruction tuning (alias supervised fine-tuning) plays crucial role in activating this potential of multi-modal language models. Specifically, the instruction tuning aims to improve the models ability to satisfy user queries. Again, take the vision language models as an example. The visual instruction tuning involves training the model on dataset that usually consists of multi-modal triplet (𝐼, 𝑄, 𝐴) of an image 𝐼 , user query 𝑄, and desired response 𝐴.

(6) Different from the previous alignment training, the instruction tuning stage involves more challenging objective to reason over the modalities, motivating the model to explore the inner interaction between different modalities to increase the likelihood of the preferred answers. It has been shown that the quality of the instruction tuning is the key to the ability [253]. Pilot studies explore various methods for constructing high-quality instruction tuning datasets such as adapting publicly available multi-modal benchmarks [231, 432, 434], synthesizing datasets using self-instruction with ChatGPT/GPT-4 [50, 254, 496, 503].

The desired output such as textual sentences, images/videos and audios, is represented in sequence of 𝑁 tokens 𝑆 = (𝑠0, . . . , 𝑠𝑁 ), given the conditioned user queries 𝑄 specifying the requirements on the target outputs.

Another challenge lies in mitigating language hallucinations [3, 53, 179, 285, 330, 488, 499], which are exacerbated due to the lack of necessary and fine-grained visual context when multimodal information is provided simultaneously.

Text-Only. Although pure text data is commonly utilized in language models, it also plays crucial role in enhancing the language expression and reasoning abilities of multimodal models. For this purpose, pure text data is integrated into the pre-training corpus. One of the most extensively used datasets in this context is C4 [147], filtered open-source dataset derived from web crawls. Its multilingual variant, mC4 [436], encompasses natural text in 101 languages, sourced from the public Common Crawl web archive. Additionally, the Wikipedia dataset [144], which consists of cleaned articles in multiple languages, is created from language-specific segments of the Wikipedia dump. Another significant contribution to this field is The Pile, an expansive and diverse open-source dataset for language modeling. Amassing total of 825 GiB, The Pile [125] is an amalgamation of 22 distinct, high-quality smaller datasets, providing rich resource for language model pretraining. Recently, RedPajama [69], an open dataset with 30 trillion tokens for training large language models, has also been introduced, contributing significantly to the resources available for developing advanced language models. Furthermore, FineWeb [310] release new, large-scale (15-trillion tokens) dataset for LLM pretraining. FineWeb is derived from 96 CommonCrawl snapshots and produces better-performing LLMs. Dolma [352] is high-quality open dataset from diverse mix of web content, academic publications, code, books, and encyclopedic materials, covering 3T tokens. Image-Based. Multimodal data is key for models to perform modality alignment, that is, to map different modal representations into unified space. CLIP [321] was developed using 400 million image-text pairs sourced from the internet. Subsequent models like ALIGN [180], BASIC [314], and Florence [464] were trained on even larger and more diverse datasets with noisier imagetext pairs. However, the majority of these extensive datasets remain inaccessible to the public. In the academic community, researchers recommend using several million image-text pairs for multimodal model pre-training, including CC12M [45], RedCaps [81], YFCC [372], WIT [355], and Capsfusion [460]. Publicly accessible datasets of relatively smaller scale include SBU [303], MSCOCO [248], VG [203], and CC3M [347]. Among the larger-scale image-text datasets available to the public are FILIP [446], LAION-400M [345], COYO-700M [35], SA-1B [398], and LAION-5B [344], among others. Additionally, some studies have emphasized the importance of data quality in building robust multimodal models, such as DataComp [123], Shutterstock [299], and ShareGPT4V [50]. Beyond sourcing image-text data from the web, there has been growing interest in compiling datasets that interleave images and text, concept pioneered by the M3W [3] dataset featured in Flamingo [3]. Notable examples of such datasets are MMC4 [512] and OBELISC [213]. Additionally, theres an emerging trend in research to focus on the extraction and association of text segments in captions with specific areas in images, leading to the formation of grounded image-text pairs. Datasets like GRIT-20M [313] and CapsFusion-grounded [357] exemplify this methodology. Video-Based. MSR-VTT [427] features 10K diverse web video clips and 200K clip-sentence pairs spanning wide range of categories. HowTo100M [292] expands this landscape with 1.22 million YouTube videos on topics like cooking and crafting, enriched with subtitles from ASR systems or manual input. ACAV100M [219] provides vast 100 million video library, ideal for self-supervised learning with high audio-visual correspondence. WebVid [14] enhances video data with manually crafted, accurate captions. Ego4D [137] offers an extensive collection of diverse egocentric video footage for research. HD-VILA [435] introduces high-resolution video-language dataset with varied content. YT-Temporal [469], sourced from public YouTube videos, focuses on broadening understanding of objects, actions, and scenes. VideoCC3M [297] utilizes new pipeline to transfer image captions to videos without extra manual labor. Youku-mPLUG [426] has released the largest 36 Chen et al. public Chinese video-language dataset, prioritizing safety, diversity, and quality. Most recently, InternVid [403] demonstrates scalable method for building high-quality video-text datasets using large language models, effectively enhancing video language representation learning. Audio-Based. Audio-based pretraining datasets can be primarily categorized into three types: speech pretraining datasets, music pretraining datasets, and general audio pretraining datasets. Librilight [190] includes more than 60k hours unlabeled speech data and is widely used by audio pretraining [391, 493]. Libriheavy [191] introduces refined pipeline for audio alignment and segmentation and detailed annotations with punctuation and capitalization, reflecting more natural speech patterns, to the mostly unlabeled Librilight. Wenetspeech [475] is the largest Mandarin speech pretraining corpus, collecting over 22,400 hours of audio, with 10,000+ hours of high-quality labeled speech, 2,400+ hours of weakly labeled speech, and roughly 10,000 hours of unlabeled speech from diverse sources such as YouTube and podcasts. Yodas [235] offer over 500,000 hours of speech data in more than 100 languages, significantly benefiting the multilingual nature of the audio pretrain community. Other widely-used speech pretraining datasets include librispeech [308], libritts [470] and gigaspeech [48]. Music pretraining is growing research area [85, 171, 241, 243, 274, 320, 510]. Million Song Dataset (MSD) [23] is one of the largest publicly available collections of audio features and metadata for million contemporary popular music tracks. FMA (Free Music Archive) Dataset [77] is well-curated collection of over 100,000 tracks from various artists and genres available under Creative Commons licenses. Other widely-used music pretraining datasets include disco10m [209], mtg-jamendo [25], and Lp-musiccaps [93]. General audio pretraining datasets, including wavcaps [286], audioset [129], vggsound [49], and clotho [98], mainly focus on boosting the performance of localizing audio-visual correspondence and audio-text intermodal translation tasks (not speech-to-text). 5.1.2 Fine-tuning Datasets. Multimodal Understanding. The inaugural work in applying instruction tuning to the multi-modal domain was presented by MultiInstruct [434], which successfully combined multi-modal learning into single-format benchmark dataset incorporating 62 diverse tasks. Concurrently, LLaVA [254] harnessed the capabilities of the language-centric GPT-4 to generate datasets for multi-modal, instruction-based tasks involving both text and images. MiniGPT-4 [509] precisely assembled dataset rich in detailed image descriptions to facilitate the convergence of visual and linguistic elements. Further advancements were marked by LMeye [239], MMEvol [278], PF-1M [46], and SVIT [496], which scaled up the magnitude of instruction tuning. The domains of video content were also explored by Video-Chat [228] and Video-ChatGPT [280], which adapted instruction tuning to this dynamic format. In the specialized medical sector, PMC-VQA [485] and LLaVA-Med [225] crafted datasets for instruction tuning by leveraging existing medical data repositories. Object detection tasks were ingeniously integrated into instruction tuning through the efforts of DetGPT [315] and MGVLID [500]. GPT4Tools [443] was developed to enhance open-source large language models (LLMs) by equipping them with the versatility to utilize an array of tools effectively, while M3IT expanded the reach of multi-modal instruction tuning across multiple languages. Expanding the horizon further, X-LLM [47], MIMIC-IT [223], MotionGPT [181], Macaw-LLM [279], and BuboGPT [502] ventured into new modalities, enhancing the scope of instruction tuning. The integration of 3D tasks into this domain was initiated by LAMM [449] and M3DBench [232], enriching the complexity and applicability of instruction tuning. Meanwhile, LLaVAR [491] leveraged publicly accessible OCR tools to harvest text-rich images from the LAION [345] dataset, thus enhancing visual instruction tuning processes.

However, the reasons behind these 42 Chen et al. differences and their impact on the performance of downstream tasks across various modalities remain unclear.

To mitigate issues like gradient norm explosion, techniques such as QK-Norm have been employed [155]. However, the root causes of these optimization difficulties in MMNTP models remain largely unexplored. Further evidence of interference is seen when MMNTP models are built on pretrained large language models, as the language capability often deteriorates when adding more modalities [490]. This demonstrates that interference can lead to suboptimal learning outcomes, as the model struggles to balance competing demands from the different modalities."

However, there are also several new\nchallenges arising in the training and inference of MMNTP models due to the involvement of data\nfrom different modalities.",
            "content": "Training System Efficiency. big challenge in scaling up MMNTP models lie in the low efficiency in training large-scale MMNTP models on massive GPUs due to the inherent heterogeneity of both models and data across different modalities. Different from the text (1D) data in LLMs, MMNTP training involves high dimensional representations such as image (2D) and video (3D) data, where little has been done to optimize the training of these models from system perspective. In particular, MMNTP exhibits scaling dependence with modality encoders. Recent studies have found that substantial idle GPU time (GPU Bubble) arises from the complex data dependencies when training MMNTP models that employ both visual encoders and backbone LLM with pipeline parallelism [298]. To address the issue, several efficient and adaptive training frameworks have been developed to optimize the scheduling of encoder computations and overlap GPU communication with computation. For example, Optimus reduces training time by decomposing image encoder layer computations into smaller kernels and scheduling those kernel executions within LLM bubbles, minimizing the pipeline idle time [117]. DistTrain leverages disaggregated model orchestration and data reordering to improve the training efficiency and scalability of MMNTP, achieving significant improvements in model FLOPS utilization and throughput [495]. Despite these advancements, the unique challenges posed by multimodal architecture, how to develop more advanced system optimizations to train MMNTP on large-scale production clusters with thousands of GPUs remains an open research question. MMNTP training also exhibit highly variable sequence lengths. As MMNTP models move towards more complex tasks such as multi-image reasoning, multi-modal RAG, video understanding, Next Token Prediction Towards Multimodal Intelligence: Comprehensive Survey 43 supporting MMNTP with long and variable sequence length becomes critical. However, existing large model training systems and the underlying parallelism technologies (data, tensor, pipeline) are limited in their ability to support efficient long sequence training. Recent studies have proposed several sequence parallelism techniques, such as DeepSpeed-Ulysses [174], Ring-Attention [259], and Unified Sequence Parallelism [114], to enable long sequence training for LLMs. However, applying these sequence parallelism strategies to MMNTP needs to take careful consideration in handling heterogeneous data from different modalities, each with distinct characteristics and sequence lengths, which motivates advanced system-algorithm co-design to address this challenge. Multimodal Tokenization Efficiency in MMNTP Models. As mentioned in the tokenization section, multimodal input like image, audio and video originally resides in continuous space, which contains lot of redundant information. The multimodal tokenization process has large room for efficiency improvement, where the core question is: can we use less tokens to represent the multimodal input while maintaining the performance? In the scope of single-modal image modeling and dual-encoder VLM architectures, various model compression methodssuch as pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantizationare applied to accelerate image encoders. Model pruning [246, 511] sparsifies the encoder backbone and removes certain modules. Knowledge distillation [415, 465] utilizes soft labels as supervision and train competent smaller dense models. Model quantization [267, 462] replaces models and computation to low-precision counterparts. Though proven effective in single-model scenarios, the adaptability of these methods to training MMNTP models remains largely unexplored. Modeling Efficiency in Understanding and Generation. Although image tokens occupy significant portion of the input sequence of MMNTP models, it is discovered that the the LLM backbone only pays small portion of attention to the image tokens compared to the language tokens [54]. This phenomenon raises the question whether we can reduce the number of image tokens during training and inference without sacrificing performance as they take up most of the sequence length but gain the least attention from the model. In single-modal image modeling, these tokens can be largely pruned using pre-trained priors [284, 425] or through entirely training-free methods [26], with minimal impact on performance. For MMNTP models such as Llava [254] and QwenVL [12], Chen et al. [54] proposed pruning approach that removes most image tokens without compromising performance. However, the reason behind the redundancy of image tokens and how to leverage this phenomenon remains underexplored for MMNTP models of different modalities. In the realm of multimodal generation, the challenge of modeling efficiency is equally pronounced. central issue is how to define an effective generative training objective that suits the Next Token Prediction (NTP) manner for various modalities, given that data from different modalities possess distinct structures. vanilla NTP training objective may not adequately address these differences, prompting the development of specialized objectives tailored to the characteristics of each modality. For instance, methods like MaskGIT [44], MAGViT [454], VAR [373], and DnD-Transformer [51] have been proposed to better accommodate the unique aspects of different modalities. Moreover, enhancing generation quality efficiently can be achieved through post-generation refinement techniques such as super-resolution [270]. Super-resolution methods aim to upscale the outputs of language models by either fine-tuning the backbone model [91, 92] or by incorporating additional modules [199, 452]. Despite significant advancements in this area, diffusion models remain the de facto model in visual generation applications. However, detailed comparison of generation quality and efficiency between MMNTP models and diffusion models is still lacking in the literature, leaving room for further exploration and research. 44 Chen et al."

However, an\nultimate challenge is beyond current explored modalities, achieving a universal interface connecting\ntasks from various sources, such as robotics [32], molecular [119] and proteins [341]. The key\nproblem is how to formulate a different task as next token prediction, and whether such formulation\nis efficient and scalable in solving the problem, which is largely underexplored outside the language,\nvision and audio data.",
            "content": "Design NTP Training Objectives for Different Modalities. For non-text modalities, simply linearizing the data into 1D sequence and conducting NTP (Next Token Prediction) training may not be the most effective approach. This strategy poses two potential issues: it can overlook the inherent structure of multimodal data and lead to excessively long sequence lengths. For instance, the spatial relationships in images and temporal relationships in videos are crucial elements that the traditional NTP training fails to consider. The number of tokens required to represent an image or video increases linearly with the images resolution and the videos duration. To address these challenges, several approaches have been developed to adapt NTP training objectives to various modalities, such as images and videos. Notable examples include MaskGiT [44], VAR [373], DnD-Transformer [51], and Next-Block-Prediction [5]. These efforts aim to better capture the unique structures present in different types of data and can reduce the inference time by generating multiple tokens at one time. Comparison to Diffusion. Diffusion models represent another popular framework for generative modeling and they have been extensively applied to multimodal data beyond the original image modality [442]. These applications extend to areas such as language [236], robotics [62], and drug discovery [169]. When comparing NTP and diffusion models, both approaches share the fundamental idea of breaking down complex generation task into multiple, more manageable steps. The major difference between these two approaches lies in how the task is decomposed. NTP breaks down the data according to its dimensional order, whereas diffusion models deconstruct the data globally in coarse-to-fine manner. There is no consensus on which method is superior, and new approaches are emerging that combine these two modeling techniques. For instance, auto-regressive diffusion models [234, 507] incorporate elements of both strategies. Exploring how different modeling methods perform on various modalities is fascinating frontier in the field."
