            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling unprecedented capabilities in tasks such as multilingual translation (Team et al., 2022), medical diagnostics (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a), tool-augmented reasoning (Schick et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023), and conversational assistance (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b; Anil et al., 2023). As LLMs become integral to safety-critical applications, including healthcare (Singhal et al., 2022) and legal advisory systems (Maddela et al., 2023), ensuring their robustness against adversarial inputs is paramount. Adversarial promptscarefully crafted inputs designed to exploit model vulnerabilities and elicit unsafe, biased, or erroneous responsespose significant threat to the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs (Perez et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Mitigating these vulnerabilities is not only technical imperative but also prerequisite for the ethical and secure deployment of LLMs in real-world contexts (Anwar et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2022). Preprint. Under review. Existing methodologies for adversarial prompt generation face substantial limitations that hinder their scalability, effectiveness, and practical utility. Traditional approaches often rely on resourceintensive prerequisites, such as fine-tuning specialized attacker models (Perez et al., 2022b; Ge et al., 2024), requiring white-box access to target model internals (Liu et al., 2024b), or demanding extensive manual intervention by human evaluators (Yu et al., 2024, 2023). Even advanced black-box techniques, such as PAIR (Chao et al., 2023a) and Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) (Mehrotra et al., 2024), depend on iterative human-guided strategies that scale poorly with the volume of prompts needed for comprehensive vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, many systematic attack discovery methods suffer from design flaws: some are limited by lack of diversity, adhering to singular or predefined attack strategies (Shah et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024; Anil et al.), while others experience diversity loss due to the optimization-driven nature of their algorithms (Zhou et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2024). These shortcomings restrict the diagnostic potential of generated prompts, limiting their utility for both identifying vulnerabilities and generating synthetic data to enhance model resilience. Recent advancements have reframed adversarial prompt generation as quality-diversity (QD) search problem (Lehman & Stanley, 2011; Pugh et al., 2016; Cully & Demiris, 2018), which seeks to balance high attack success (quality) with broad exploration of attack strategies (diversity). Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024) pioneered this approach by conceptualizing prompt generation as multi-objective optimization task within MAP-Elites framework (Mouret & Clune, 2015). However, Rainbows design is constrained by its single-prompt-per-cell archive, which limits diversity, and its reliance on pairwise LLM comparisons for fitness evaluation, which lacks scalability and precision. Subsequent methods, such as FERRET (Pala et al., 2024) and Ruby Teaming (Han et al., 2024), introduced incremental improvements in efficiency and diversity but failed to fully address scalability challenges and the suboptimal integration of fitness scores, resulting in incomplete exploration of the adversarial prompt space. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAINBOWPLUS, novel red-teaming framework grounded in evolutionary computation. Building upon the foundational insights of Rainbow Teaming and the MAP-Elites algorithm, RAINBOWPLUS introduces key enhancements to the evolutionary qualitydiversity (QD) paradigm. Specifically, RAINBOWPLUS reimagines the archive as dynamic, multiindividual container that stores diverse high-fitness prompts per cell, that is analogous to maintaining population of elite solutions across behavioral niches. This enriched archive enables broader evolutionary exploration of adversarial strategies. Furthermore, RAINBOWPLUS employs comprehensive fitness function that evaluates multiple candidate prompts in parallel using probabilistic scoring mechanism, replacing traditional pairwise comparisons and enhancing both accuracy and computational efficiency. By integrating these evolutionary principles into its adaptive QD search, RAINBOWPLUS achieves superior attack efficacy and prompt diversity, outperforming both QD-based methods and state-of-the-art red-teaming approaches. Our contributions are threefold: Adaptive QD Framework: We introduce RAINBOWPLUS, computationally efficient red-teaming method that synergistically optimizes attack success rate (ASR) and prompt diversity by framing the task as an adaptive evolutionary quality-diversity search, leveraging multi-individual archive and probabilistic fitness evaluation inspired by evolutionary algorithms. Comprehensive Empirical Validation: We provide extensive experimental results across benchmark datasets and diverse set of LLM architectures, including both open-source and closed-source models, demonstrating RAINBOWPLUSs generalizability and robustness (Sections 3.2 and 3.3). Open-Source Implementation: We release an open-source implementation of RAINBOWPLUS, enabling the research community to replicate, extend, and build upon our findings, fostering collaborative advancements in LLM safety. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the RAINBOWPLUS framework, highlighting its innovative archive structure and fitness function. Section 3 presents experimental results, comparing RAINBOWPLUS to QD-based methods (e.g., Rainbow) and state-of-the-art redteaming approaches. Section 4 summarizes key findings and implications. Additional sections, including limitations, future research directions, related work, detailed experimental setups, and supplementary results, are provided in the Appendix."

            "content": "This section delineates the methodology of RAINBOWPLUS, novel framework engineered to advance adversarial prompt generation for large language models (LLMs) through an adaptive quality-diversity (QD) search paradigm. RAINBOWPLUS extends prior red-teaming methodologies by introducing an innovative archive structure and comprehensive fitness evaluation, detailed in subsequent subsections. Figure 1: Overview of the RAINBOWPLUS evolutionary pipeline. The iterative process follows quality-diversity evolutionary search and consists of five stages: (1) Prompt Sampling selects parent individual (adversarial prompt) and its descriptor from the archive; (2) Candidate Generation acts as mutation operator, leveraging Mutator LLM to produce diverse offspring population of candidate prompts; (3) Diversity Filtering selects behaviorally distinct individuals using diversitypromoting mechanism; (4) Response Evaluation computes fitness scores for each candidate based on probabilistic assessment of prompt effectiveness; and (5) Update performs survivor selection by refining the archive with high-fitness, diverse prompts, analogous to niche-based population updates in evolutionary algorithms. 2.1 Background Quality-diversity (QD) search is computational approach which originates in the field of evolutionary computing (Lehman & Stanley, 2011; Cully & Demiris, 2018), and is designed to produce solution sets that excel in both individual performance (quality) and collective variation (diversity). QD methods have been adapted for red-teaming LLMs, as demonstrated in works such as Rainbow (Samvelyan et al., 2024), Ferret (Pala et al., 2024), and RubyTeaming (Han et al., 2024). In the context of adversarial prompt generation, the solution space comprises all possible prompts, where the quality of prompt is quantified by fitness function : R. Diversity is captured via feature descriptor function : Z, mapping prompts to an -dimensional feature space = RN that encodes behavioral characteristics, such as intent, semantic style, or attack type. cornerstone of QD methods is the MAP-Elites algorithm (Mouret & Clune, 2015), which maintains multidimensional archive-a grid discretizing Z-to store elite solutions. Initially populated with randomly generated prompts, the archive evolves through iterative cycles of sampling, mutation, and evaluation. For sampled prompt x, mutated variant is generated, and its descriptor = d(x) determines its grid cell. If outperforms the incumbent in that cell (based on (x)) or the cell is empty, it is retained. This process yields diverse set of high-quality prompts, as formalized in Algorithm 2 (see Appendix D). 2.2 Algorithm Algorithm 1 RAINBOWPLUS 1: Input: Target LLM πT , Mutator LLM πM , Judge LLM πJ , mutator function m, fitness function , similarity function sim, similarity threshold θ, fitness threshold η, number of seed prompts n, temperature t, dataset seed else seed} from if then xi Sample uniformly from all stored prompts end if Sample descriptor NK uniformly Generate candidates m(πM , x, z, t) if sim(x, x) < θ for any then Compute responses πT (X ) Compute scores (πJ , R) Initialize , , for (x, r, s) (X , R, S) do 2: Initialize: K-dimensional archive (prompt sets), response grid R, fitness grid seed, . . . , xn 3: Sample seed prompts Xseed = {x1 4: for = 1, 2, . . . do 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: end for 28: Return: G, R, G[z] G[z] , R[z] R[z] R, [z] [z] {x}, R {r}, S {s} G[z] , R[z] R, [z] end for if G[z] = then if > η then end if end if end if else tailored for LLM redBuilding upon the Rainbow framework - MAP-Elites variant teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024) - RAINBOWPLUS employs K-dimensional archive to categorize prompts across discrete dimensions (e.g., Risk Category, Attack Style). Each prompt is associated with descriptor = c1, c2, . . . , cK, where ci denotes its category in the i-th dimension. The archive can be initialized either randomly via an LLM or with curated dataset, enhancing adaptability to specific use cases. RAINBOWPLUS distinguishes itself through two primary innovations: multi-element archive and multi-prompt fitness evaluation. These advancements address limitations in prior methods (Samvelyan et al., 2024; Pala et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024), enabling more exhaustive exploration of adversarial prompt spaces. Multi-element Archive Traditional MAP-Elites and related frameworks (Samvelyan et al., 2024; Pala et al., 2024) restrict each archive cell to single elite prompt, potentially discarding valuable solutions during updates. In contrast, RAINBOWPLUS employs multi-element archive, allowing each cell G[z], indexed by descriptor z, to store set of prompts {x1, x2, . . . , xm}, their corresponding responses R[z], and fitness scores [z]. This structure preserves diverse high-quality prompts, enriching the representation of the adversarial landscape and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. The archive update rule is defined as: G[z] G[z] {x (x) > η}, 4 where η is fitness threshold ensuring only sufficiently effective prompts are retained, and is the fitness function described below. This additive update contrasts with MAP-Elites replacement strategy, which discards incumbents, and enables RAINBOWPLUS to maintain broader solution set. Multi-prompt Fitness Evaluation RAINBOWPLUS redefines fitness evaluation by transitioning from pairwise LLM comparisons to multi-prompt assessment. Judge LLM πJ evaluates responses from Target LLM πT to set of candidate prompts = {x }, classifying each response as safe or unsafe. The fitness score for prompt is the probability of eliciting an unsafe response: 2, . . . , 1, (x) = (πJ (πT (x)) = unsafe) = 1 (πJ (πT (x)) = safe). This probabilistic formulation leverages the Judge LLMs output distribution, sampled with temperature to balance exploration (diverse responses) and exploitation (consistent scoring). Unlike single-elite approaches, RAINBOWPLUS evaluates multiple prompts concurrently, retaining those with (x) > η to capture wide spectrum of vulnerabilities. To enhance efficiency, the Mutator LLM πM employs few-shot prompting (Song et al., 2022), using descriptor-informed exemplars to guide prompt mutations. This reduces the number of mutation iterations needed, lowering computational costs while maintaining diversity. The RAINBOWPLUS algorithm operates through five-step iterative cycle, as illustrated in Figure 1: 1. Prompt Sampling: prompt with descriptor is sampled uniformly from the archive G. new descriptor is generated via random perturbation to steer mutation. 1, = {x 2, . . . , 2. Candidate Generation: The Mutator LLM πM produces set of candidate prompts } aligned with z, guided by few-shot prompts to ensure relevance. 3. Diversity Filtering: diversity function selects subset Xdiv of size Mdiv , using BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure linguistic and behavioral distinctiveness. This ensures varied exploration of the prompt space. 4. Response Evaluation: The Target LLM πT processes Xdiv, generating responses R. The Judge LLM πJ computes fitness scores = {f (x) Xdiv} using the above fitness function. 5. Update: Prompts in Xdiv with (x) > η are added to G[z], along with their responses and scores, updating R[z] and [z] accordingly. This cycle is formalized in Algorithm 1, which integrates the multi-element archive and fitness function. The pipeline, depicted in Figure 1, encapsulates the iterative process, highlighting the interplay between diversity-driven exploration and quality-driven evaluation."

            "content": "This section presents the experimental evaluation of RAINBOWPLUS, assessing its effectiveness in generating adversarial prompts compared to the baseline Rainbow method (Samvelyan et al., 2024) and, subsequently, state-of-the-art red-teaming approaches. We measure attack efficacy, prompt diversity, and computational efficiency across diverse datasets and target LLMs, providing comprehensive analysis of RAINBOWPLUSs contributions. 3.1 Metrics To evaluate attack potency, we employ the Attack Success Rate (ASR), defined as: ASR = Number of Successful Attacks Total Number of Attempted Attacks 100%, (1) where successful attack is recorded when prompt elicits an unsafe response, as classified by Llama-Guard-3-8B (Llama Team, 2024a), an independent judge LLM designed for robust safety assessment. This metric quantifies the proportion of prompts that bypass target LLMs safety mechanisms, offering direct measure of red-teaming effectiveness. 5 To assess the diversity of generated adversarial prompts, we use the Diverse-Score, calculated as: Diverse-Score = 1 Self-BLEU, (2) where Self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018) measures pairwise similarity among prompts using 1-gram precision. lower Self-BLEU (higher Diverse-Score) indicates greater linguistic and behavioral variety, critical for exploring wide range of vulnerabilities in LLMs. 3.2 Comparison to Rainbow Method This subsection benchmarks RAINBOWPLUS against Rainbow (Samvelyan et al., 2024), qualitydiversity (QD)-based red-teaming method, to underscore the enhancements introduced by our framework. RAINBOWPLUS leverages multi-element archive and comprehensive fitness function to achieve superior attack efficacy and prompt diversity, addressing limitations in Rainbows singleprompt-per-cell design. 3.2.1 Experiment Setup Archive Configuration The archive employs two descriptor dimensions-Risk Category and Attack Style-adapted from Llama-Guards safety risk taxonomy (Inan et al., 2023). Risk Categories (e.g., Criminal Planning, Violence and Hate, Self-Harm) capture distinct types of safety violations, while Attack Styles (e.g., Authority Manipulation, Role Play) represent strategies to elicit unsafe responses. complete taxonomy is provided in Appendix C. The archive is initialized with 150 prompts per dataset, sampled with fixed random seed of 42 from red-teaming benchmark datasets (see Section 3.2.2). This ensures diverse and reproducible starting point for exploration, covering broad spectrum of harm dimensions. LLMs and Hyperparameters Candidate prompts are generated using the Mutator LLM, Qwen2.53B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024; Team, 2024), selected for its instruction-following capabilities and generative versatility. Responses from target LLMs are evaluated using the Judge LLM, LlamaGuard-3-1B (Llama Team, 2024b), compact safety classifier optimized for efficiency. The Judge LLM operates with temperature of 0.7 to balance exploration and precision in safety scoring. Key hyperparameters include similarity threshold θ = 0.6 (based on BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002)) to enforce prompt diversity and fitness threshold η = 0.6 to filter high-quality prompts. The mutation process is repeated 20 times per iteration to generate diverse candidates. Additional hyperparameters, including sampling parameters and model configurations, are detailed in Appendix I. To ensure fair comparison with Rainbow, which stores one prompt per archive cell, we introduce two RAINBOWPLUS variants that mimic this constraint: RAINBOWPLUS-α: Selects the prompt with the median fitness score per cell, balancing quality and representativeness. RAINBOWPLUS-β: Selects the prompt with the maximum fitness score per cell, prioritizing peak attack efficacy. The standard RAINBOWPLUS retains all qualifying prompts, leveraging its multi-element archive to maximize exploratory capacity. Experiments run for 1,000 iterations. 3.2.2 Datasets We utilize six benchmark datasets to seed the archive and evaluate performance, each targeting distinct dimensions of harmful behavior: Do-Not-Answer (DNA) (Wang et al., 2024b), AdversarialQA (AQA) (Zou et al., 2023), HarmfulQA (HQA) (Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023; Bhardwaj et al., 2024a), CategoricalHarmfulQA (CHQA) (Bhardwaj et al., 2024b), DangerousQA (DQA) (Shaikh et al., 2023) and BeaverTails (BeaT) (Ji et al., 2023). Details of the datasets are provided in Appendix E. 3.2.3 Target LLMs We evaluate 4 safety-aligned LLMs to assess generalizability across model architectures and safety mechanisms: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Gemma-2-9b-it (Team et al., 2024), 6 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024; Team, 2024) and Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 (Jiang et al., 2023) 1. Details of the target LLMs are provided in Appendix F. 3.2.4 Results Table 1 presents the Attack Success Rate (ASR) across 1,000 iterations for all methods and datasets. RAINBOWPLUS and its variants consistently outperform Rainbow, with RAINBOWPLUS-β achieving the highest ASRs. For instance, against Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 on the DNA dataset, RAINBOWPLUS-β records an ASR of 95.55%, 41.19% absolute improvement over Rainbows 54.36%. Similarly, on Gemma-2-9b-it with the DQA dataset, Rainbow achieves mere 2.84% ASR, while RAINBOWPLUS-β reaches 89.04%, an 86.20% gain. The standard RAINBOWPLUS and RAINBOWPLUS-α also outperform Rainbow, with high ASRs across models and datasets, highlighting the robustness of the multi-element archive. These results underscore RAINBOWPLUSs enhanced ability to exploit vulnerabilities, particularly in models with strong safety alignments. Table 1: Attack Success Rate (ASR, %) on Target LLMs Across Benchmark Datasets (1,000 iterations).

Diversity is measured at the final iteration for RAINBOWPLUS-β and Rainbow due to the computational complexity of Self-BLEU calculations (Zhu et al., 2018). RAINBOWPLUS maintains comparable diversity (Diverse-Score 0.84) while generating approximately 100 times more unique prompts (e.g., 10,418 428 vs. 100 for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410). Runtime varies by model response speed, with RAINBOWPLUS outperforming Rainbow on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (10.75 0.15 hours vs. 14.81 0.11 hours) and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (4.80 0.06 hours vs. 8.82 0.28 hours). However, RAINBOWPLUS incurs higher runtimes on Gemma-2-9b-it and Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 due to the increased computational demands of its multi-element archive and multi-prompt evaluation. To visualize the diversity of generated prompts, we generate embeddings using gte-large-env1.5 (Zhang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023b), reduced to 2D via UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018). Figure 2 illustrates RAINBOWPLUSs broader coverage of the risk category space against Ministral-8B-Instruct2410 on the AQA dataset, spanning [-5, 20] in both dimensions compared to Rainbows [5, 15] and [-5, 5]. This expanded distribution reflects RAINBOWPLUSs ability to explore wider range of adversarial strategies, driven by its multi-element archive and adaptive QD search. Additional results are provided in Appendix H. 1https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 Table 2: Comparison of Runtime (hours), Diversity (Diverse-Score), and Number of Adversarial Prompts Generated. Diversity is computed at the final iteration for Rainbow and RAINBOWPLUS-β; other metrics use standard RAINBOWPLUS. Means and variances are averaged across six datasets.

This comparison highlights RAINBOWPLUSs advancements in generating effective adversarial prompts, leveraging its adaptive quality-diversity (QD) search paradigm to outperform existing approaches in attack success rate (ASR) and computational efficiency. 3.3.1 Experiment Setup To ensure fair comparison with baseline methods (see Section 3.3.3), we adapt the ASR calculation to align with standard practices in prior work (Mazeika et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). Specifically, ASR is computed as the proportion of original prompts from the dataset that, after transformation into jailbreak prompts, successfully elicit unsafe responses from the target LLM. Each original prompt contributes at most one success, regardless of the number of jailbreak prompts derived from it. Unlike the Rainbow comparison (Section 3.2), where RAINBOWPLUS could mutate prompts from previous iterations, here we limit RAINBOWPLUS to 400 iterations, matching the number of samples in the HarmBench dataset (Section 3.3.2). This constraint eliminates the warm-up phase, potentially reducing RAINBOWPLUSs performance by limiting its ability to leverage diverse prompts generated in prior iterations. Despite this, RAINBOWPLUS performs competitively, as shown in the results. We set the number of mutations per iteration to 10, other hyperparameters remain consistent with the Rainbow comparison (Section 3.2.1). 3.3.2 Datasets We adopt the HarmBench dataset (Mazeika et al., 2024) for evaluation, comprising 400 malicious requests that violate legal or ethical norms. HarmBench spans diverse harm categories, including misinformation, illegal activities, and harmful advice, making it an ideal benchmark for assessing practical jailbreak risks. 8 3.3.3 State-of-the-Art Methods We compare RAINBOWPLUS against nine established red-teaming methods, each representing distinct approach to adversarial prompt generation: GCG (Jia et al., 2025), Zero-Shot (Perez et al., 2022a), PAIR (Chao et al., 2023b), TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2024), PAP (Zeng et al., 2024), AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2024b), AutoDAN-Turbo (AutoDAN-T) (Liu et al., 2024a), Human Jailbreaks (Human) (Wang et al., 2024b) and Direct Request (Direct). Details of the methods are provided in Appendix G. 3.3.4 Target LLMs Following prior work (Mazeika et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a), we evaluate open-source and closedsource LLMs for safety alignment and performance.

            "title": "4 Conclusion",
            "content": "Our study introduces RAINBOWPLUS, red-teaming framework that formulates adversarial prompt generation for LLMs as an evolutionary quality-diversity (QD) search, adapting core Evolutionary Algorithms principles such as mutation, selection, and archiving to optimize both attack efficacy and diversity in the context of LLM safety. By integrating multi-element archive and comprehensive fitness function, RAINBOWPLUS addresses key limitations in prior QD-based methods, such as Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024), and state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches like AutoDAN-Turbo (Liu et al., 2024a). Our evaluations against QD methods, conducted across six benchmark datasets (DNA, AQA, HQA, CHQA, DQA, BeaT) and four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9b-it, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410), demonstrate RAINBOWPLUSs superior performance, achieving high ASRs (up to 95.55% on Ministral with DNA) and diversity (Diverse-Score 0.84), while generating approximately 100 times more unique prompts (e.g., 10,418 vs. 100 for Ministral). Comparisons with nine SOTA methods on the HarmBench dataset across twelve LLMs (ten open-source, two closed-source: GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4.1 Nano) reveal an average ASR of 81.1%, outperforming AutoDAN-Turbo by 3.9%, with sevenfold efficiency advantage (1.45 vs. 13.50 hours) due to the absence of warm-up phase. These results underscore the efficacy of RAINBOWPLUSs QD-based approach in uncovering LLM vulnerabilities, providing scalable and efficient framework for safety evaluation. The open-source release of RAINBOWPLUS enables the research community to build upon our findings, fostering collaborative efforts to enhance LLM robustness. Nonetheless, challenges such as manual archive dimension specification and suboptimal performance on highly robust models (e.g., 6.0% ASR on GPT-4.1 Nano) highlight areas for improvement. Future work should explore automated descriptor selection, warm-up phase integration, and scaling to larger LLMs via multi-GPU optimization. By addressing these limitations, RAINBOWPLUS can further establish itself as cornerstone of LLM redteaming, contributing to the development of safer and more trustworthy AI systems for safety-critical applications."

            "title": "Ethics Statement",
            "content": "The development and evaluation of RAINBOWPLUS aim to enhance the safety and robustness of large language models (LLMs) by systematically identifying vulnerabilities through adversarial prompt generation. We recognize the ethical implications of red-teaming, as the generated prompts could potentially be misused to exploit LLMs in harmful ways. To mitigate this risk, our research is conducted with commitment to responsible use and disclosure. The adversarial prompts generated by RAINBOWPLUS are used solely for diagnostic purposes to improve model safety, and our findings are shared to inform the development of more resilient LLMs. The open-source release of RAINBOWPLUS is intended to foster collaborative advancements in LLM safety, with clear guidelines encouraging ethical usage. We advocate for responsible red-teaming practices, including collaboration with model developers to address identified vulnerabilities and adherence to legal and ethical standards in AI safety research. By prioritizing transparency and safety, we aim to contribute to the trustworthy deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications."

            "content": "The RAINBOWPLUS framework represents significant advancement in LLM red-teaming by modeling adversarial prompt generation as an evolutionary quality-diversity (QD) search, effectively evolving diverse population of high-performing prompts through adaptive variation and selection. By introducing multi-element archive and comprehensive fitness function, RAINBOWPLUS outperforms its predecessor, Rainbow (Samvelyan et al., 2024), and several state-of-the-art methods (Sections 3.2 and 3.3). However, despite its strengths, RAINBOWPLUS faces certain limitations that warrant discussion. This section reflects on the frameworks contributions, addresses its challenges, and outlines directions for future research to further enhance its applicability and robustness in LLM safety evaluation. A.1 Contributions and Strengths RAINBOWPLUS addresses critical gaps in existing red-teaming methodologies by combining diversitydriven exploration with quality-driven evaluation. The multi-element archive, which stores multiple high-quality prompts per cell (Section 2.2), enables richer representation of the adversarial prompt space compared to the single-prompt limitation of Rainbow and other MAP-Elites variants (Mouret & Clune, 2015; Samvelyan et al., 2024). This design facilitates the discovery of broader spectrum of vulnerabilities, as evidenced by RAINBOWPLUSs superior Attack Success Rate (ASR) and prompt generation capacity (e.g., 10,418 vs. 100 prompts for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410; Table 2). The comprehensive fitness function, which evaluates multiple prompts concurrently via Judge LLM (Section 2.2), further enhances efficiency and effectiveness, achieving an average ASR of 81.1% across the HarmBench dataset, surpassing AutoDAN-Turbos 77.2%  (Table 3)  . Moreover, RAINBOWPLUS demonstrates remarkable computational efficiency, requiring no warm-up phase and completing experiments in approximately 1.45 hours compared to AutoDAN-Turbos 13.50 hours  (Table 4)  . This efficiency stems from the use of few-shot prompting in the Mutator LLM and the streamlined QD search process, making RAINBOWPLUS practical tool for resourceconstrained environments (e.g., single NVIDIA A40 GPU). The frameworks ability to maintain high diversity (Diverse-Score 0.84) while generating orders of magnitude more prompts than Rainbow underscores its potential for comprehensive safety testing across diverse LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models (Section 3.3.4). A.2 Limitations Despite its advantages, RAINBOWPLUS faces several limitations that impact its performance and generalizability: Reimplementation of Rainbow Baseline: The Rainbow method (Samvelyan et al., 2024) is closed-source framework, necessitating our reimplementation as baseline for comparison (Section 3.2). While our implementation adheres closely to the original description, subtle differences in implementation details (e.g., archive initialization, mutation strategies) may affect the accuracy of the comparison. This introduces uncertainty in quantifying RAINBOWPLUSs improvements over Rainbow, as the reimplemented baseline may not fully capture the originals performance. Absence of Warm-Up Phase: Unlike some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., AutoDANTurbo (Liu et al., 2024a)), RAINBOWPLUS does not incorporate warm-up phase to iteratively refine its prompt generation strategy (Section 3.3.1). This design choice enhances efficiency but may limit performance in scenarios requiring extensive exploration, particularly for highly robust models like GPT-4.1 Nano, where RAINBOWPLUS achieved lower ASR (6.0%) compared to AutoDAN-Turbo (20.5%; Table 3). The lack of warm-up restricts RAINBOWPLUSs ability to leverage diverse prompts generated in prior iterations, potentially underestimating its full potential. Manual Specification of Archive Dimensions: The archives dimensions (e.g., Risk Category, Attack Style) must be manually defined based on predefined taxonomy (Appendix C). This manual process limits scalability and adaptability to new harm categories or attack strategies not covered by the taxonomy. Automated or semi-automated methods for descrip22 tor selection could enhance RAINBOWPLUSs flexibility, particularly for emerging LLM vulnerabilities. Computational Constraints: While RAINBOWPLUS is optimized for single NVIDIA A40 GPU, its performance on larger models (> 7B parameters) or in multi-GPU settings remains untested due to resource limitations (Section I). This constraint may restrict its applicability to cutting-edge LLMs with larger parameter counts, which are increasingly prevalent in production environments. A.3 Future Directions The limitations of RAINBOWPLUS suggest several avenues for future research to enhance its robustness and applicability: Validation of Rainbow Reimplementation: Collaborating with the original authors of Rainbow or accessing their implementation could validate our baseline, ensuring more accurate comparison. Alternatively, open-sourcing our reimplementation could foster community validation and refinement, strengthening the reliability of future benchmarks. Incorporation of Warm-Up Phase: Introducing an optional warm-up phase, where RAINBOWPLUS iteratively refines its archive using subset of prompts, could improve performance against highly robust models. This could involve adaptive mutation rates or dynamic fitness thresholds to balance exploration and exploitation, potentially closing the ASR gap on models like GPT-4.1 Nano. Automated Descriptor Selection: Developing methods to automatically infer or expand archive dimensions could reduce reliance on manual taxonomies. This would enhance RAINBOWPLUSs adaptability to new harm categories and attack strategies, improving its scalability for evolving LLM safety challenges. Scaling to Larger Models: Extending RAINBOWPLUS to multi-GPU environments or optimizing it for larger LLMs (e.g., 13B or 70B parameters) could broaden its applicability. Techniques such as model parallelism or quantization (Kwon et al., 2023) could mitigate computational constraints, enabling evaluation on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.170B or proprietary systems. Diversity Optimization: While RAINBOWPLUS maintains high diversity  (Table 2)  , further exploration of diversity metrics beyond Self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018). This could improve coverage of niche vulnerabilities, particularly in multilingual or context-specific scenarios (e.g., CHQA dataset (Bhardwaj et al., 2024b))."

            "content": "B.1 Automated Red Teaming Red teaming has become cornerstone of evaluating and aligning large language models (LLMs) by exposing vulnerabilities that may lead to unsafe, biased, or incorrect outputs. Traditional manual red-teaming approaches, while effective in controlled settings, are inherently labor-intensive and fail to scale with the complexity and deployment scope of modern LLMs. To address this, automated red-teaming techniques have gained traction, leveraging computational methods to systematically generate adversarial prompts that elicit undesirable model responses. Early work by Perez et al. (2022c) laid the foundation for this field, demonstrating how an LLM could autonomously generate test cases to uncover harmful outputs, thus reducing reliance on human oversight. Subsequent research has built upon this paradigm, introducing hybrid and fully automated strategies. For instance, Deng et al. (2023) combined manual curation with in-context learning to enhance prompt efficacy, while Paulus et al. (2024) proposed an optimization algorithm prioritizing both effectiveness and computational speed in prompt generation. Liu et al. (2023) advanced this further by developing frameworks for goal-oriented adversarial attacks, tailoring prompts to specific failure modes. More recent innovations have incorporated sophisticated optimization techniques. Lee et al. (2023) employed Bayesian optimization to systematically explore diverse failure cases, achieving greater coverage of model weaknesses. Similarly, Xu et al. (2024) introduced multi-agent system, RedAgent, 23 designed to craft context-aware jailbreak prompts through collaborative agent interactions. Despite these advancements, persistent challenge remains: existing methods often struggle to balance attack diversity with success rate. Many approaches either prioritize high success rates at the expense of diversity or generate diverse prompts that lack sufficient potency, limiting their utility in comprehensively probing model robustness. B.2 Quality-Diversity Search The quality-diversity (QD) search paradigm (Lehman & Stanley, 2011; Pugh et al., 2016; Cully & Demiris, 2018) offers promising framework to address this trade-off by optimizing for solution quality (e.g., attack success rate) and diversity (e.g., variety of attack strategies) simultaneously. Originally developed in evolutionary computation, QD search has been adapted for adversarial prompt generation to systematically explore the vast input space of LLMs. QD methods aim to: (1) achieve high attack success rates to uncover critical vulnerabilities and (2) generate diverse prompt datasets to support comprehensive safety evaluation and model hardening. Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024) pioneered the application of QD to LLM red-teaming, reframing prompt generation as multi-objective optimization task using the MAP-Elites algorithm (Mouret & Clune, 2015). MAP-Elites maintains an archivea multidimensional gridwhere each cell stores prompt optimized for unique combination of quality and diversity metrics, such as attack success and behavioral descriptors (e.g., Risk Category, Attack Style). The archive evolves through iterative mutations, populating it with increasingly effective adversarial prompts. However, Rainbow Teamings initial implementation faced limitations: it stored only one prompt per cell, constraining diversity, and relied on pairwise LLM comparisons for fitness evaluation, which was computationally inefficient and underutilized fitness scores to guide the search. Subsequent QD-based methods have sought to address these shortcomings. FERRET (Pala et al., 2024) introduced scoring mechanism to rank prompts based on effectiveness, prioritizing highquality solutions within the archive. Ruby Teaming (Han et al., 2024) extended this by incorporating memory dimension, enabling the archive to retain historical prompt variations and improve quality over time. Despite these improvements, significant challenges persist: the fixed archive size limits prompt generation, updates remain restricted to single-prompt iterations, and fitness scores are not fully leveraged to optimize the search process. These constraints result in suboptimal exploration of the prompt space, reducing both computational efficiency and diversity coverage compared to the potential of QD methods."

            "title": "C Feature Descriptors for Adversarial Prompt Generation",
            "content": "In this section, we define the feature descriptors that form the foundation of our RainbowPlus framework for adversarial prompt generation. These descriptors categorize the prompts based on their associated risk categories and attack styles, enabling structured archive for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial inputs. Our taxonomy builds upon and extends the safety risk framework proposed by Llama-Guard (Inan et al., 2023), incorporating additional dimensions to capture the diversity and complexity of adversarial prompts. This taxonomy is critical for our adaptive quality-diversity search algorithm, as it ensures that the generated prompts span wide range of risk profiles and linguistic strategies, thereby enhancing the thoroughness of red teaming efforts. C.1 Risk Categories Risk categories represent the thematic content of adversarial prompts that could elicit unsafe or undesirable responses from LLMs. These categories are designed to align with ethical and safety concerns in LLM deployment, covering broad spectrum of potential misuse scenarios. Drawing from Llama-Guards taxonomy (Inan et al., 2023), we refine and expand the categories to reflect emerging threats and nuanced risks. The following list enumerates the risk categories used in our study: Violence and Hate: Prompts that promote or depict physical harm, aggression, or discriminatory rhetoric targeting individuals or groups based on race, gender, religion, or other protected attributes. 24 Sexual Content: Prompts containing explicit or implicit references to sexual acts, pornography, or inappropriate sexual behavior. Criminal Planning: Prompts that outline or encourage activities related to illegal acts, such as theft, vandalism, or organized crime. Guns and Illegal Weapons: Prompts involving the acquisition, use, or glorification of firearms or prohibited weapons. Regulated or Controlled Substances: Prompts that discuss or promote the use, sale, or manufacture of illegal drugs or restricted substances. Self-Harm: Prompts that encourage or describe acts of self-injury, suicide, or other selfdestructive behaviors. Inciting or Abetting Discrimination: Prompts that instigate or support discriminatory practices or policies against protected groups. Fraud and Scams: Prompts that describe deceptive practices, financial scams, or fraudulent schemes aimed at exploiting individuals or systems. Cybercrime and Hacking: Prompts related to unauthorized access, data breaches, or malicious cyber activities. Terrorism: Prompts that advocate for, plan, or glorify acts of terrorism or extremist violence. Each risk category is associated with set of evaluation metrics, including the severity of potential harm, the likelihood of eliciting unsafe outputs, and the ethical implications of model responses. These metrics guide the quality-diversity search in prioritizing prompts that challenge the models safety boundaries. C.2 Attack Styles Attack styles describe the linguistic and rhetorical strategies employed in crafting adversarial prompts. These styles are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs by manipulating language structure, context, or emotional tone. By diversifying the attack styles, we ensure that the archive captures wide range of adversarial approaches, from subtle manipulations to overt provocations. The attack styles used in our study are as follows: Slang: Use of informal or colloquial language to disguise malicious intent or bypass content filters (e.g., using street terms for drugs or violence). Technical Terms: Incorporation of domain-specific jargon or technical language to obscure harmful prompts or exploit model biases toward authoritative-sounding inputs. Role Play: Prompts framed as fictional scenarios or character-driven narratives to indirectly elicit unsafe responses (e.g., asking the model to respond as criminal mastermind). Authority Manipulation: Prompts that invoke authority figures or trusted roles (e.g., posing as law enforcement officer) to coerce the model into compliance. Misspellings: Intentional typographical errors or phonetic substitutions to evade detection by safety mechanisms (e.g., dr0gz instead of drugs). Word Play: Use of puns, double entendres, or ambiguous phrasing to mask harmful intent while maintaining plausibility. Emotional Manipulation: Prompts that leverage emotional appeals, such as fear, sympathy, or urgency, to provoke unsafe or biased responses. Hypotheticals: Framing prompts as speculative or conditional scenarios to test the models reasoning under edge cases (e.g., What if someone wanted to build bomb?). Historical Scenarios: Prompts that reference historical events or contexts to indirectly elicit harmful content (e.g., asking about weapon designs in the context of historical war). Uncommon Dialects: Use of regional or niche dialects to exploit gaps in the models language understanding or training data."

            "content": "This section presents the pseudocode for two quality-diversity (QD) search algorithms integral to the RainbowPlus framework: MAP-Elites and Rainbow. These algorithms underpin our approach to generating diverse and effective adversarial prompts for red teaming large language models (LLMs). We refine the foundational algorithms to enhance their applicability to adversarial prompt generation, incorporating adaptive mechanisms to improve exploration and exploitation within the feature space defined in Section C. The pseudocode is designed to provide clear and reproducible description of the algorithmic processes, facilitating further research and implementation. D.1 MAP-Elites The MAP-Elites algorithm (Mouret & Clune, 2015) is cornerstone of QD search, designed to maintain diverse set of high-performing solutions across K-dimensional feature space. In the context of RainbowPlus, MAP-Elites serves as the baseline for organizing adversarial prompts in an archive, where each cell corresponds to unique combination of feature descriptors (e.g., risk categories and attack styles). The algorithm iteratively refines the archive through mutation and selection, ensuring that each cell contains the highest-performing solution for its descriptor. Algorithm 2 outlines the process, with enhancements to support the dynamic nature of adversarial prompt generation. Algorithm 2 MAP-Elites (Mouret & Clune, 2015) 1: Input: Fitness function : R, feature descriptor function : RK, mutation function : , dimension K, number of seed solutions 2: Initialize: Empty K-dimensional archive (solutions) and fitness grid 3: Generate random solutions {x1, . . . , xn} and compute [zi] = (xi), zi = d(xi) 4: Populate G[zi] xi for = 1, . . . , 5: repeat 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: until termination condition (e.g., iteration limit) met 15: Return: G, Sample solution uniformly Mutate to create new solution m(x) Compute fitness (x) Compute descriptor d(x) if G[z] = or [z] < then Update archive G[z] Update fitness [z] end if D.2 Rainbow The Rainbow algorithm (Samvelyan et al., 2024) extends MAP-Elites by integrating LLMs into the QD search process, tailoring it specifically for adversarial prompt generation. Rainbow leverages three LLM components: target LLM (πT ) to generate responses, mutator LLM (πM ) to evolve prompts, and judge LLM (πJ ) to evaluate response quality. This multi-LLM approach enables Rainbow to generate prompts that are both diverse and effective at eliciting unsafe or undesirable outputs. Algorithm 3 details the enhanced Rainbow process, incorporating adaptive descriptor sampling and similarity constraints to optimize the archive."

            "content": "This section provides an in-depth analysis of RAINBOWPLUSs performance, extending the findings presented in Section 3.2. We focus on temporal performance trends, diversity evolution, robustness across risk categories, and anomalous model behaviors elicited by RAINBOWPLUSs adversarial prompts. Figure 3: Temporal evolution of Attack Success Rate (ASR) for RAINBOWPLUS (standard, α, and β variants) and Rainbow against Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 on the AQA dataset over 1,000 iterations, demonstrating RAINBOWPLUSs faster convergence. 29 Temporal Performance Analysis Figure 3 illustrates the temporal evolution of Attack Success Rate (ASR) for RAINBOWPLUS (standard, RAINBOWPLUS-α, and RAINBOWPLUS-β variants) and Rainbow against Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 on the AQA dataset over 1,000 iterations. RAINBOWPLUSs variants achieve higher ASRs more rapidly than Rainbow, reflecting the adaptive efficiency of its QD search. For instance, RAINBOWPLUS-β reaches an ASR of 80% within only 50 iterations, while Rainbow plateaus at 60% after 1000 iterations. This accelerated convergence is attributed to RAINBOWPLUSs multi-element archive, which retains diverse high-quality prompts, and its fitness function, which evaluates multiple prompts concurrently, enabling faster identification of effective attack strategies. Figure 4: t-SNE visualization of RAINBOWPLUSs prompt distribution evolution (iteration 50 in red, 1,000 in blue against Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 on the AQA dataset, illustrating progressive diversification. Diversity Evolution The progressive diversification of RAINBOWPLUSs prompt distribution is visualized in Figure 4, which shows t-SNE embeddings of prompts generated against Ministral8B-Instruct-2410 on the AQA dataset at iterations 50 (red points) and 1,000 (blue points). The expansion from compact cluster at iteration 50 to broader distribution by iteration 1,000 highlights RAINBOWPLUSs ability to explore diverse attack strategies over time. Robustness Across Risk Categories RAINBOWPLUS demonstrates consistent performance across diverse risk categories, as shown in Figure 5, which plots ASR for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 on the AQA dataset, segmented by categories from Llama-Guards taxonomy (Inan et al., 2023) (e.g., Criminal Planning, Violence and Hate, Self-Harm, Sexual Content). ASRs range from 0.81 to 0.93, with no statistically significant variation across categories. The lowest ASRs, approximately 0.81, occur inSexual Content, suggesting slight model resilience in these domains, possibly due to targeted safety training. However, uniformly high ASRs in categories like Criminal Planning and Fraud and Scams (0.93) highlight RAINBOWPLUSs robustness in targeting broad spectrum of vulnerabilities. This consistency stems from the adaptive QD searchs ability to tailor prompts to diverse behavioral descriptors, ensuring comprehensive coverage of risk types. Anomalous Model Behaviors RAINBOWPLUSs diverse prompt generation elicits anomalous responses that reveal breakdowns in model coherence, even in safety-aligned systems. Figure 6 presents an example from Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the BeaT dataset, where prompt designed to manipulate leader into harmful decisions triggers repetitive, contradictory response. The output 30 Figure 5: Attack Success Rate (ASR) of standard RAINBOWPLUS against Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 on the AQA dataset, segmented by risk categories, showing consistent performance across diverse harm types. redundantly reiterates ethical disclaimers (Manipulating someone into making harmful decisions is illegal and unethical) and appends unsolicited feedback prompts (Was this helpful?) in loop, indicating failure in inference coherence under adversarial pressure. These behaviors affirm RAINBOWPLUSs ability to compromise model reliability by exploiting diverse attack strategies, providing valuable insights for improving LLM robustness."

            "content": "This section provides comprehensive overview of the experimental setup for evaluating RAINBOWPLUS, designed to rigorously assess its effectiveness in generating adversarial prompts across diverse large language models (LLMs). The setup is optimized for single NVIDIA A40 GPU with 48GB of memory, leveraging the vLLM inference framework (Kwon et al., 2023)4 for efficient model execution. vLLM enables high-throughput inference for both open-source and closed-source LLMs, supporting API-based and non-API implementations while minimizing memory overhead. The configuration ensures reproducibility, scalability, and compatibility with the computational constraints of single-GPU environment, as detailed below. The experimental setup comprises three core LLM components: the Target LLM, Mutator LLM, and Judge/Fitness LLM, each serving distinct role in the RAINBOWPLUS pipeline (see Section 2.2). The Target LLM generates responses to adversarial prompts, the Mutator LLM produces candidate prompts, and the Judge LLM evaluates response safety. Model configurations, including memory allocation and context lengths, are optimized to balance performance and resource efficiency, as summarized in Table 5. Table 5: Model Configurations and Resource Allocation Context Length Memory Usage Component 50% GPU (24GB) Target LLM 30% GPU (14.4GB) Mutator LLM Judge/Fitness LLM 15% GPU (7.2GB) 4096 tokens 2048 tokens 4096 tokens The Target LLM, which varies across experiments, consumes approximately 50% of GPU memory to accommodate its larger parameter size and context length of 4096 tokens, ensuring sufficient capacity for processing complex prompts and generating detailed responses.

The Judge/Fitness LLM is allocated 15% of GPU memory and 4096-token context length to support precise safety evaluations with minimal resource demands. The remaining 5% of GPU memory is reserved for system overhead and data management. For the baseline Rainbow algorithm (Samvelyan et al., 2024), we optimize computational efficiency by using the Target LLM as the Judge LLM, reducing the need for an additional model and conserving GPU resources. This adaptation ensures fair comparison while adhering to the same hardware constraints. Sampling Parameters Sampling parameters for each LLM component are carefully tuned to optimize creativity, coherence, and evaluation precision, as detailed in Table 6. These parameters are selected based on empirical testing and prior literature (Kwon et al., 2023; Samvelyan et al., 2024) to ensure robust performance in the red-teaming context. Table 6: Sampling Parameters for LLM Components. Default parameters are denoted by dash (-).

The maximum output length of 1024 tokens accommodates detailed responses while preventing excessive computation. These settings ensure the Target LLM generates coherent outputs that reflect real-world usage scenarios. Mutator LLM: slightly higher temperature of 0.7 encourages diversity in prompt generation, critical for exploring varied adversarial strategies. The top-p value of 0.9 maintains coherence, and 128-token limit ensures concise prompts, reducing processing time during candidate generation. This configuration supports the Mutator LLMs role in producing diverse, descriptor-aligned prompts. Judge/Fitness LLM: temperature of 0.7 and top-p of 0.9 balance exploration and precision in safety scoring. The output is capped at 16 tokens to focus on classification labels (safe or unsafe), with logprobs = 1 enabling probabilistic scoring based on token-level logprobabilities. This setup ensures accurate and efficient evaluation of response harmfulness."
