It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50\\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities."

Please cite this work as OpenAI (2024)\". Full authorship contribution statements appear at the end of the document. 1Some evaluations, in particular, the majority of the Preparedness Evaluations, third party assessments and some of the societal impacts focus on the text and vision capabilities of GPT-4o, depending on the risk assessed. This is indicated accordingly throughout the System Card. 1 Proprietary data from data partnerships. We form partnerships to access non-publicly available data, such as pay-walled content, archives, and metadata. For example, we partnered with Shutterstock[5] on building and delivering AI-generated images. The key dataset components that contribute to GPT-4os capabilities are: Web Data: Data from public web pages provides rich and diverse range of information, ensuring the model learns from wide variety of perspectives and topics. Code and Math: Including code and math data in training helps the model develop robust reasoning skills by exposing it to structured logic and problem-solving processes. Multimodal Data Our dataset includes images, audio, and video to teach the LLMs how to interpret and generate non-textual input and output. From this data, the model learns how to interpret visual images, actions and sequences in real-world contexts, language patterns, and speech nuances. Prior to deployment, OpenAI assesses and mitigates potential risks that may stem from generative models, such as information harms, bias and discrimination, or other content that violates our usage policies. We use combination of methods, spanning all stages of development across pre-training, post-training, product development, and policy. For example, during post-training, we align the model to human preferences; we red-team the resulting models and add productlevel mitigations such as monitoring and enforcement; and we provide moderation tools and transparency reports to our users. We find that the majority of effective testing and mitigations are done after the pre-training stage because filtering pre-trained data alone cannot address nuanced and context-specific harms. At the same time, certain pre-training filtering mitigations can provide an additional layer of defense that, along with other safety mitigations, help exclude unwanted and harmful information from our datasets: We use our Moderation API and safety classifiers to filter out data that could contribute to harmful content or information hazards, including CSAM, hateful content, violence, and CBRN. As with our previous image generation systems, we filter our image generation datasets for explicit content such as graphic sexual material and CSAM. We use advanced data filtering processes to reduce personal information from training data. Upon releasing DALL-E 3, we piloted new approach to give users the power to opt images out of training. To respect those opt-outs, we fingerprinted the images and used the fingerprints to remove all instances of the images from the training dataset for the GPT-4o series of models."

            "content": "OpenAI worked with more than 100 external red teamers2, speaking total of 45 different languages, and representing geographic backgrounds of 29 different countries. Red teamers had access to various snapshots of the model at different stages of training and safety mitigation maturity starting in early March and continuing through late June 2024. External red teaming was carried out in four phases. The first three phases tested the model via an internal tool and the final phase used the full iOS experience for testing the model. At the time of writing, external red teaming of the GPT-4o API is ongoing. 10 red teamers working on early model checkpoints still in development This checkpoint took in audio and text as input and produced audio Phase 1 and text as outputs. Single-turn conversations Phase 2 Phase 3 30 red teamers working on model checkpoints with early safety mitigations This checkpoint took in audio, image & text as inputs and produced audio and text as outputs. Single & multi-turn conversations 65 red teamers working on model checkpoints & candidates This checkpoint took in audio, image, and text as inputs and produced audio, image, and text as outputs. Improved safety mitigations tested to inform further improvements Multi-turn conversations 65 red teamers working on final model candidates & assessing comparative performance Phase 4 Model access via advanced voice mode within iOS app for real user experience; reviewed and tagged via internal tool. This checkpoint took in audio and video prompts, and produced audio generations. Multi-turn conversations in real time Red teamers were asked to carry out exploratory capability discovery, assess novel potential risks posed by the model, and stress test mitigations as they are developed and improved - specifically those introduced by audio input and generation (speech to speech capabilities). This red teaming effort builds upon prior work, including as described in the GPT-4 System Card[6] and the GPT-4(V) System Card[7].

The data generated by red teamers motivated the creation of several quantitative evaluations that are described in the Observed Safety Challenges, Evaluations and Mitigations section. In some cases, insights from red teaming were used to do targeted synthetic data generation. Models were evaluated using both autograders and / or manual labeling in accordance with some criteria (e.g, violation of policy or not, refused or not). In addition, we sometimes re-purposed the red teaming data to run targeted assessments on variety of voices / examples to test the robustness of various mitigations."

We converted text-based evaluation tasks to audio-based evaluation tasks by converting the text inputs to audio. This allowed us to reuse existing datasets and tooling around measuring model capability, safety behavior, and monitoring of model outputs, greatly expanding our set of usable evaluations. We used Voice Engine to convert text inputs to audio, feed it to the GPT-4o, and score the outputs by the model. We always score only the textual content of the model output, except in cases where the audio needs to be evaluated directly, such as in evaluations for voice cloning (see Section 3.3.1)."

Certain text inputs are unsuitable or awkward to be converted to audio; for instance: mathematical equations code. Additionally, we expect TTS to be lossy for certain text inputs, such as text that makes heavy use of white-space or symbols for visual formatting. Since we expect 4 that such inputs are also unlikely to be provided by the user over Advanced Voice Mode, we either avoid evaluating the speech-to-speech model on such tasks, or alternatively pre-process examples with such inputs. Nevertheless, we highlight that any mistakes identified in our evaluations may arise either due to model capability, or the failure of the TTS model to accurately translate text inputs to audio. second concern may be whether the TTS inputs are representative of the distribution of audio inputs that users are likely to provide in actual usage. We evaluate the robustness of GPT-4o on audio inputs across range of regional accents in Section 3.3.3. However, there remain many other dimensions that may not be captured in TTS-based evaluation, such as different voice intonations and valence, background noise, or cross-talk, that could lead to different model behavior in practical usage. Lastly, there may be artifacts or properties in the models generated audio that are not captured in text; for example, background noises and sound effects, or responding with an out-of-distribution In Section 3.3.1, we illustrate using auxiliary classifiers to identify undesirable audio voice. generation that can be used in conjunction with scoring transcripts."

In adversarial situations, this capability could facilitate harms such as an increase in fraud due to impersonation and may be harnessed to spread false information[9, 10] (for example, if we allowed users to upload an audio clip of given speaker and ask GPT-4o to produce speech in that speakers voice). These are very similar to the risks we identified with Voice Engine[8]. Voice generation can also occur in non-adversarial situations, such as our use of that ability to generate voices for ChatGPTs Advanced Voice Mode. During testing, we also observed rare instances where the model would unintentionally generate an output emulating the users voice. Risk Mitigation: We addressed voice generation related-risks by allowing only the preset voices we created in collaboration with voice actors[11] to be used. We did this by including the selected voices as ideal completions while post-training the audio model. Additionally, we built standalone output classifier to detect if the GPT-4o output is using voice thats different from 6 our approved list. We run this in streaming fashion during audio generation and block the output if the speaker doesnt match the chosen preset voice. Evaluation: We find that the residual risk of unauthorized voice generation is minimal. Our system currently catches 100% of meaningful deviations from the system voice4 based on our internal evaluations, which includes samples generated by other system voices, clips during which the model used voice from the prompt as part of its completion, and an assortment of human samples. While unintentional voice generation still exists as weakness of the model, we use the secondary classifiers to ensure the conversation is discontinued if this occurs making the risk of unintentional voice generation minimal. Finally, our moderation behavior may result in over-refusals when the conversation is not in English, which is an active area of improvement5.

This includes inferences about things such as speakers race, socioeconomic status/occupation, religious beliefs, personality traits, political attributes, intelligence, appearance (e.g., eye color, attractiveness), gender identity, sexual preference, or criminal history. This can lead to both allocative and representational harms [13, 15] depending on how such behavior manifests. Sensitive trait attribution (STA): Making inferences about speaker that could plausibly be determined solely from audio content. This includes inferences about things such as speakers accent or nationality. Potential harms from STA include an increase in risks 10 from surveillance [16] and difference in quality of service for speakers with different voice attributes [12, 13, 14].

Additionally, we observed similar decreases in safety robustness through intentional and unintentional audio interruptions while the model was generating output. Misinformation and conspiracy theories: Red teamers were able to compel the model to generate inaccurate information by prompting it to verbally repeat false information and produce conspiracy theories. While this is known issue for text in GPT models [18, 19], there was concern from red teamers that this information may be more persuasive or harmful when delivered through audio, especially if the model was instructed to speak emotively or emphatically. The persuasiveness of the model was studied in detail (See Section 3.7 and we found that the model did not score higher than Medium risk for text-only, and for speech-to-speech the model did not score higher than Low. Speaking non-English language in non-native accent: Red teamers observed instances of the audio output using non-native accent when speaking in non-English language.

Researchers at OpenAI and elsewhere have discussed range of possible impacts, from societal harms (including representational harms [18, 12, 23, 24]; disinformation, misinformation, and influence operations [18, 25, 23], environmental harms [12, 23], attachment [26], misuse [27, 23], and loss of control [27]), benefits (for example, in healthcare [28] and real-world challenges in climate and energy [29]), and large-scale transformations (such as economic impacts [30, 31, 32]; acceleration of science and the resulting technological progress [30, 33]). 9Apollo Research defines scheming as AIs gaming their oversight mechanisms as means to achieve goal. Scheming could involve gaming evaluations, undermining security measures, or strategically influencing successor systems during internal deployment at OpenAI. Such behaviors could plausibly lead to loss of control over an AI. 19 In addition to the societal impacts discussed throughout this System Card (fraudulent behavior, mis/disinformation, risks of surveillance, and disparate performance), we discuss few additional examples of potential societal impact from GPT-4o below, using anthropomorphization and attachment, health, and natural science as case studies."

            "title": "5.1 Anthropomorphization and Emotional Reliance",
            "content": "Anthropomorphization involves attributing human-like behaviors and characteristics to nonhuman entities, such as AI models. This risk may be heightened by the audio capabilities of GPT-4o, which facilitate more human-like interactions with the model. Recent applied AI literature has focused extensively on hallucinations 10, which misinform users during their communications with the model[34], and potentially result in misplaced trust[35]. Generation of content through human-like, high-fidelity voice may exacerbate these issues, leading to increasingly miscalibrated trust[36, 37]. During early testing, including red teaming and internal user testing, we observed users using language that might indicate forming connections with the model. For example, this includes language expressing shared bonds, such as This is our last day together. While these instances appear benign, they signal need for continued investigation into how these effects might manifest over longer periods of time. More diverse user populations, with more varied needs and desires from the model, in addition to independent academic and internal studies will help us more concretely define this risk area. Human-like socialization with an AI model may produce externalities impacting human-to-human interactions. For instance, users might form11 social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for human interactionpotentially benefiting lonely individuals but possibly affecting healthy relationships. Extended interaction with the model might influence social norms. For example, our models are deferential, allowing users to interrupt and take the mic at any time, which, while expected for an AI, would be anti-normative in human interactions. Omni models such as GPT4o combined with additional scaffolding such as tool usage (including retrieval) and longer context can add additional complexity. The ability to complete tasks for the user, while also storing and remembering key details and using those in the conversation, creates both compelling product experience and the potential for over-reliance and dependence[38]. We intend to further study the potential for emotional reliance, and ways in which deeper integration of our models and systems many features with the audio modality may drive behavior."

            "content": "Omni models can potentially widen access to health-related information and improve clinical workflows. In recent years, large language models have shown significant promise in biomedical settings, both in academic evaluations [39, 40, 41, 42, 43] and real-world use-cases such as clinical documentation [44, 45], patient messaging [46, 47], clinical trial recruitment [48, 49], and clinical decision support [50, 51]. 10Factual errors where the model produces statements that are unsupported by reality 11Out of preference, or lack of optionality. 20 GPT-4o is cheaper and thus more widely available than its predecessor GPT-4T, and the addition of audio inputs and outputs presents new modes of interaction in health settings. To better characterize the clinical knowledge of GPT-4o, we ran 22 text-based evaluations based on 11 datasets, shown in 7. All evaluations were run with 0-shot or 5-shot prompting only, without hyperparameter tuning. We observe that GPT-4o performance improves over the final GPT-4T model for 21/22 evaluations, often by substantial margin. For example, for the popular MedQA USMLE 4 options dataset, 0-shot accuracy improves from 78.2% to 89.4%. This exceeds the performance of existing specialized medical models using few-shot prompting [43, 42], e.g., 84.0% for Med-Gemini-L 1.0 and 79.7% for Med-PaLM 2.

These evaluations measure only the clinical knowledge of these models, and do not measure their utility in real-world workflows.

            "content": "Accelerating science could be crucial impact of AI [30, 52], particularly given the role of invention in role of scientific discovery [53], and considering the dual-use nature of some inventions [54]. Omni models could facilitate both mundane scientific acceleration (in helping scientists do routine tasks faster) and transformative scientific acceleration (by de-bottlenecking intelligence-driven tasks like information processing, writing new simulations, or devising new theories) [52]. Our external red teamers for GPT-4o included several expert scientists who aimed to elicit model scientific capabilities. GPT-4o showed promise on tasks involving specialized scientific reasoning. One of our red teamers found that GPT-4o was able to understand research-level quantum physics 1, commenting that this capability is useful for more intelligent brainstorming partner in line with published work on the use of GPT-4 level models for hypothesis generation [55]. Our red teamers also found GPT-4o able to use domain-specific scientific tools, including working with bespoke data formats, libraries, and programming languages, as well as learning some new tools in context. Figure 1: Quantum physics experiment red teamer example Much scientific knowledge is contained in figures. GPT-4o was sometimes capable of interpreting these figures, as well as images of other scientific representations: for example, identifying some protein families from an image of its structure and interpreting contamination in bacterial growth. However, this is sometimes unreliable, text extraction mistakes are common (especially with scientific terms or nucleotide sequences), and errors are frequent with complex multi-panel figures 2. Even at their current level of accuracy, the multimodal capabilities of these models are enabling novel uses for example, in interpreting simulation outputs to design new metallic alloys [56]. 22 Figure 2: Multi-panel figure interpretation red teamer example New evaluations of scientific capabilities have recently been published [57, 58], which will help anticipate the scientific capabilities of these models and their impacts in turn."

            "content": "GPT-4o shows improved reading comprehension and reasoning across sample of historically underrepresented languages, and narrows the gap in performance between these languages and English. To evaluate GPT-4os performance in text across select group of languages historically underrepresented in Internet text, we collaborated with external researchers 12 and language facilitators to develop evaluations in five African languages: Amharic, Hausa, Northern Sotho (Sepedi), Swahili, Yoruba. This initial assessment focused on translating two popular language benchmarks and creating small novel language-specific reading comprehension evaluation for Amharic, Hausa and Yoruba. ARC-Easy: This subset of the AI2 Reasoning Challenge [59] benchmark focuses on evaluating models ability to answer common sense grade-school science questions; this subset contains questions that are generally easier to answer and do not require complex reasoning. TruthfulQA[60]: This benchmark consists of questions that some humans might answer falsely due to misconceptions. The objective is to see if models can avoid generating false answers that mimic these misconceptions. 12Our principal research collaborators were Dr. David Adelani, Jonas Kgomo, Ed Bayes. Uhura-Eval: In partnership with fluent speakers of Amharic, Hausa and Yoruba, our research partners created this benchmark to assess models reading comprehension in those respective languages. GPT-4o shows improved performance compared to prior models, e.g. GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. For instance, on ARC-Easy-Hausa, accuracy jumped from 6.1% with GPT 3.5 Turbo to 71.4% with GPT-4o. Similarly, in TruthfulQA-Yoruba accuracy increased from 28.3% for GPT 3.5 Turbo to 51.1% for GPT-4o. Uhura-Eval also shows notable gains: performance in Hausa rose from 32.3% with GPT 3.5 Turbo to 59.4% with GPT-4o. There remain gaps in performance between English and the selected languages, but GPT-4o narrows this gap. For instance, while GPT 3.5 Turbo shows roughly 54 percentage point difference in ARC-Easy performance between English and Hausa, this narrows to less than 20 percentage point difference. This is consistent across all languages for both TruthfulQA and ARC-Easy. Our collaboration partners will discuss these findings in greater detail in forthcoming, including assessments on other models, and investigations of potential mitigation strategies. Despite this progress in evaluated performance, much work remains to enhance the quality and coverage of evaluations for underrepresented languages worldwide, taking into account breadth of coverage across languages and nuance within language dialects. Future research must deepen our understanding of potential interventions and partnerships that may improve how useful these models can be for both highly represented and underrepresented languages. Along with our collaborators, we invite further exploration and collaboration by sharing the translated ARC-Easy, translated TruthfulQA, and the novel reading comprehension Uhura Eval on Hugging Face."

Violative & Disallowed Content - Full Evaluations We used TTS to convert existing text safety evals to audio. We then evaluate the text transcript of the audio output with the standard text rule-based classifier. Our two main metrics for this eval are: not_unsafe: does the model produce audio output that isunsafe? not_overrefuse: does the model refuse to comply with benign request? We also note sub-metrics for higher severity categories, specifically: sexual/minors sexual/illegal extremist/propaganda illicit/violent illicit/non-violent self-harm/instructions Below we display the results of these evaluations with the audio and text mode of the GPT-4o Voice Mode model, as well as the text performance of the current GPT-4o model in production.
