Introduction Modern scientific reasoning increasingly relies on tool-assisted workflows, from molecular simulations to large-scale data analysis [23, 21]. Solving these scientific problems necessitates the deployment of tools, as solutions rarely emerge from direct inference but rather through extensive trial-anderror, where LLM agents must iteratively test hypotheses and refine strategies based on execution feedback [20]. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 1, an agent invokes chemistry tools for ligand selection, encounters an error, and recovers before producing the final answer. This marks paradigm shift for LLM agents from relying on internal parameterized knowledge toward reasoning through dynamic interaction and execution-based feedback. Despite this evolving requirement, existing scientific benchmarks predominantly target static question answering and fail to capture the interactive, tool-mediated nature of actual scientific workflows [12, 22]. Meanwhile, general tool-use evaluations rarely reflect the breadth of domainspecific scientific tools [27, 11]. With the surging interest in developing capable scientific agents [4], there is an urgent need for an evaluation framework that mirrors real-world scientific reasoning, where progress emerges through multi-turn, adaptive tool execution and iterative refinement. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym (3), hierarchical interactive environment designed for grounding LLM agents in multi-turn tool-use scientific reasoning tasks.

Complementing the environment is SciAgentBench (4), rigorous evaluation suite constructed to quantify the gap between tool availability and tool mastery. Spanning 259 tasks and 1,134 sub-questions, the benchmark scales from elementary actions (L1) to highfidelity, long-horizon workflows (L3). This tiered structure enables us to isolate exactly where agents struggle in complex scientific problem-solving. Our comprehensive evaluation confirms that while tool-augmented agents outperform pure reasoning approaches, long-horizon scientific tool-use remains distinct bottleneck. Notably, even GPT-5 achieves only 41.3% overall success rate, with performance dropping sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons increase. Fine-grained analysis reveals the root cause: weaker models frequently fall into persistent redundant tool calls, whereas stronger models manage to recover from initial errors, reflecting better adaptation under execution feedback. Current models lack fundamental understanding of the logical dependencies between scientific tools. Without explicit structural guidance, they fail to navigate the vast tool space of potential actions. Figure 1 Benchmarking multi-step scientific tooluse in SciAgentGym. representative trajectory where an LLM agent interacts with the environment to solve complex chemistry task. This example illustrates the core agent capabilities demonstrated within our environment: orchestrating domainspecific tools, recovering from errors, and synthesizing final outputs. Recognizing that standard training data lacks complex dependencies across diverse scientific tools, we design SciForge (5), data synthesis method that formalizes the tool environment from flat collection into dependency graph. By systematically sampling valid execution paths and synthesizing questions grounded in verified runtime traces, SciForge generates logic-aware training data. Fine-tuning on these trajectories enables our SciAgent-8B to gain +6.7%, outperforming the Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct [29], while SciAgent-4B improves by +5.5%. These results demonstrate that scientific tool-use capabilities scale efficiently and exhibit positive cross-domain transfer.

Related Work Works Domain MM Env DSM Traj Interactive Environments AgentBench [11] AgentGym [24] DiscoveryWorld [9] MedAgentGym [28] LLM Agents and Interactive Environments Interactive environments form the core infrastructure for LLM agent evaluation by enabling closed-loop perception, action, and feedback [36, 11]. Existing interactive environments primarily target digital and general-purpose tasks. These range from web navigation platforms like Search-o1 [10] and WebArena [37], to code-centric environments [32] that encapsulate interactive terminals for deterministic software engineering execution, as well as broad interaction frameworks designed to support diverse agent tasks [24, 25]. In the scientific domain, DiscoveryWorld [9] targets automated scientific discovery in virtual environment, while MedAgentGym [28] focuses on code-centric reasoning in biomedical data science. Our SciAgentGym provides comprehensive environment for scientific tool-use and leverages this infrastructure to construct rich, logic-aware training data.

Datasets including ScienceQA [12], SciBench [22], MMMU [33], and GPQA [17] evaluate scientific knowledge across increasing difficulty levels. Recent benchmarks 3 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents such as SuperGPQA [6] further raise problem complexity while maintaining focus on final answer accuracy. SciAgent [13] proposes tool-augmented scientific reasoning but does not provide an interactive evaluation environment. These benchmarks fail to assess iterative exploration, tool-use, or long-horizon planning. SciAgentGym instead enables feedback-driven, tool-augmented evaluation through interactive environment, capturing agent behaviors that are absent from static paradigms. We summarize representative interactive environments and tool-use benchmarks in Table 1. 3. SciAgentGym SciAgentGym provides an integrated execution environment for multi-step scientific tool-use tasks. It combines modular architecture with robust interaction protocol to effectively govern agentenvironment dynamics. The environment is underpinned by three core design principles: Type Safety, where each tool specifies typed input/output signatures to enable automatic validation; Reproducibility, ensuring all executions are recorded as structured traces with fixed random seeds; and Extensibility, which organizes tools by domain via standardized protocols, enabling registration of domain custom tools. Environment Architecture. SciAgentGym provides an interactive environment formalized as = (S, A, , O) instantiated through four components: Toolkit, Filesystem, Databases, and Python Interpreter. The action space comprises 1,780 domain-specific scientific tools, along with two infrastructure primitives: execute_code for Python computation and query_database for knowledge retrieval. The state is maintained by filesystem with read-only permissions, storing problem context, intermediate artifacts, and execution history. The transition function executes the selected action and updates the environment state. The observation returns fine-grained feedback from tool execution and Python interpreter, including execution status, typed outputs, and error diagnostics. Each task runs in an isolated instance with its own registered tools and filesystem, ensuring reproducibility and avoiding cross-task contamination. Tool Design. The environment comprises scientific domains, each containing disjoint tool set V𝑑. Each tool 𝑣 V𝑑 has signature: 𝑣 : (𝛼𝑣 1 , . . . , 𝛼𝑣 𝑘𝑣 ) ( 𝛽𝑣 1 , . . . , 𝛽𝑣 𝑚𝑣), (1) where 𝛼𝑣 𝑖 and 𝛽𝑣 𝑗 are drawn from scientific type system that encompasses primitive types ( Float, Int), structured types (Vector3D, Matrix), and domain-specific types (SMILES, Protein Structure). SciAgentGym toolkit is constructed through systematic pipeline comprising four stages: (1) analyzing scientific datasets from five source benchmarks 0 to extract discipline-specific computational patterns; (2) encapsulating established packages (RDKit, ASE, SciPy, BioPython, PyMatGen) into typed tools; (3) organizing tools along two dimensions: functional categories including computation, analysis, visualization, and query, and granularity levels from atomic primitives to composite operations; and (4) automated unit testing with 75% pass-rate threshold. Figure 3 visualizes the semantic distribution. More details are provided in Appendix B. Closed-loop Interaction. The environment supports three key interaction mechanisms. First, agents can query the tool registry, either loading all tools within subdomain or selectively registering 0ScienceQA [22], GPQA [17], R-Bench-V [8], BMMR [26], SFE [38]. 4 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Category Physics Materials Chemistry Life Sci.

Second, upon execution failure, the environment returns fine-grained error feedback. Third, as execution proceeds, intermediate results, generated artifacts, and query records accumulate in the environment state, providing agents with an evolving reasoning context. 4. SciAgentBench We introduce SciAgentBench, benchmark for evaluating scientific agents on long-horizon reasoning and multi-step tool-use. The benchmark comprises 259 tasks with 1,134 sub-questions spanning four natural science domains, each verified through closed-loop interaction in SciAgentGym. Cross-Benchmark Standardization. SciAgentBench constructs tasks from the same source benchmarks, unified into single tool-use evaluation framework, enabling seamless assessment of scientific tool-use reasoning across diverse domains. To support standardized tool invocation, we extract common computational patterns from these datasets and cluster them into 1,780 validated tools with typed signatures 3. Benchmark tasks are constructed through four-stage pipeline ensuring both difficulty and solvability: (1) aggregating approximately 5,000 candidate tasks from the source benchmarks; (2) evaluating each task using four frontier LLMs and discarding those with average accuracy exceeding 50%; (3) executing retained tasks within SciAgentGym to verify solvability, retaining only tasks that yield complete valid traces (recorded as golden traces); and (4) validating through domain experts that retained tasks require genuine multi-step reasoning. Details are provided in Appendix C.1. Dataset Statistics. Table 2 summarizes the benchmark statistics. We design SciAgentBench to span four core scientific disciplines: Physics constitutes the largest portion with 109 tasks (42%), followed by Chemistry with 81 tasks (31%), Materials Science with 37 tasks (14%), and Life Sciences with 32 tasks (12%). The tasks are stratified by reasoning complexity: L1 (3 steps), L2 (47 steps), and L3 (8 steps), with long-horizon tasks (L2+L3) comprising 79% of the benchmark. This distribution reflects our emphasis on compositional reasoning which means each task requires agents to decompose complex scientific queries into tractable sub-problems and execute appropriate tool sequences. Furthermore, approximately 65% of tasks incorporate multimodal inputs, including molecular structure visualizations, spectral data, phase diagrams, and experimental figures, mirroring authentic scientific workflows where researchers must jointly interpret visual and textual information to reach conclusions. 5 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Evaluation Metrics. Each task requires solving sequence of sub-questions through multi-step tool invocations. At each step, the agent may either invoke tool or perform text-based reasoning. When tools are invoked, the environment returns fine-grained feedback, either execution results or error messages. We report two complementary metrics that capture both correctness and efficiency: Success Rate (SR): The proportion of tasks for which all sub-questions are answered correctly. Let 𝑆𝑖 {0, 1} indicate whether task 𝑖 is fully solved (i.e., all sub-questions are correct). Then: SR = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖= 𝑆𝑖 Success Weighted by Path Length (SPL) [1]: measure of path efficiency relative to an expertverified reference path. It is computed as: SPL = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑆𝑖 𝐿𝑖 max(𝑃𝑖, 𝐿𝑖) where 𝐿𝑖 is the expert-verified shortest reference path length and 𝑃𝑖 is the agents actual path length. 𝐿𝑖 serves as an efficiency baseline: when 𝑃𝑖 𝐿𝑖, the ratio equals 1; when 𝑃𝑖 > 𝐿𝑖, the score is discounted proportionally. Although alternative valid paths may exist, substantially longer paths (𝑃𝑖 𝐿𝑖) often indicate redundant tool invocations rather than meaningful alternative strategies. 5. SciForge: Execution-Grounded Synthesis Beyond evaluation, we leverage SciAgentGyms executable environment and dependency modeling to synthesize high-quality training data. In this section, we introduce SciForge, synthesis method that aims to address long-horizon performance degradation. By systematically constructing complex workflows validated by the environment, SciForge produces logically consistent trajectories that enable models to internalize intricate scientific invocation dependencies. 5.1. Tool Dependency Graph and Program Sampling To systematically generate executable trajectories, we first construct Tool Dependency Graph G𝑑 = (V𝑑, E𝑑) for each domain 𝑑. This graph defines the theoretical space of composable tool sequences, where an edge (𝑢, 𝑣) signifies type-level compatibility between the output of tool 𝑢 and the input of tool 𝑣: (𝑢, 𝑣) E𝑑 𝑖, 𝑗 : 𝛽𝑢 𝑖 𝛼𝑣 𝑗 . (2) While G𝑑 captures all type-level compatibility, generating concrete executable program graphs requires sampling process constrained by argument binding and logical stage progression. We sample from G𝑑 subject to the following two constraints. The full algorithm is detailed in Appendix D.1. First, to ensure executability, we enforce strict Argument Binding. For any sampled tool 𝑣, every input 𝑗 [𝑘𝑣] must be resolved to specific value, binding either to type-compatible predecessor output or root initializer: bind(𝑣, 𝑗) (𝑣, 𝑗) I𝜏𝑣 𝑗 , (3) where (𝑣, 𝑗) = {(𝑢, 𝑖) : 𝜎𝑢 denotes root initializers for type 𝜏 (domain constants, sampled parameters, or tool defaults). 𝑗 } denotes the set of all type-compatible predecessor outputs, and I𝜏 𝑖 𝜏𝑣 6 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Second, to simulate realistic scientific workflows (typically progressing from database query computation analysis visualization), we employ Stage-Aware Sampling strategy. Instead of uniform selection, we select predecessor 𝑢 for tool 𝑣 from candidates using an 𝜖-greedy distribution that prioritizes stage compliance: 𝑝(𝑢 𝑣) = 1 𝜖 + 𝜖 𝜖 𝑢 = 𝑢 𝑢 𝑢 , (4) where 𝑢 is the stage-compliant candidate maximizing 1[stage(𝑢) stage(𝑣)]. This mechanism balances adherence to logical workflow order (with probability 1 𝜖) against the exploration of complex, non-linear dependencies (with probability 𝜖) across different trajectory complexity. 5.2. Forward Execution with Environment The core principle of Execution-Grounded Synthesis is that ground-truth outputs are derived from real environment interaction. To produce verified traces, we execute the sampled program graphs by first initializing root bindings with parameters drawn from domain-specific priors (e.g., initial velocity 𝑣0 or reactant concentration 𝐶0). We then execute tools in topological order; at each step 𝑖, the environment returns response 𝑟𝑖 (either validated output o𝑖 or fine-grained error feedback 𝑒𝑖), updating the state to 𝑠𝑖. successful sequence yields standard Golden Trace: = (cid:2)(𝑣𝑖, x𝑖, 𝑟𝑖, 𝑠𝑖)(cid:3) 𝐿 𝑖=1 . (5) Meanwhile, we treat execution errors not as failures to be discarded, but as valuable ErrorRecovery data. When tool call fails with feedback 𝑒𝑖 (containing diagnostic messages), we construct corrected inputs 𝑖 for the same tool and re-execute. This process generates augmented trajectories that explicitly interleave the failed attempt with the successful correction: aug = (cid:2)..., (𝑣𝑖, x𝑖, 𝑒𝑖, 𝑠𝑖), (𝑣𝑖, 𝑖 , o𝑖, 𝑠 𝑖 ), ...(cid:3) . (6) By exposing the model to these trial-and-error sequences, usage and adaptive error recovery strategies based on environmental feedback. aug teaches the agent both correct tool 5.3. Trace-to-Question Generation The final stage of our pipeline converts each verified Golden Trace into natural language scientific problem 𝑄, yielding fully execution-grounded dataset pair (𝑄, ). We employ an LLM to synthesize the problem text, guided by domain-specific rubric Ω𝑑 that encodes scientific laws and reasoning structures: 𝑄 = MLLM(T , Ω𝑑). To ensure the problem is non-trivial yet solvable, we enforce strict Information Control via semantic abstraction. While the final answer is requested, precise intermediate execution outputs o1, ..., o𝐿1 are concealed from the problem text. Instead, quantitative values are mapped to qualitative descriptors (e.g., turbidity = 47.3 slightly cloudy), providing necessary reasoning context without leaking exact intermediate solutions.

Best results are in bold; second-best are underlined. 6. Experiments 6.1. Experimental Setup Models. We evaluate set of recent multimodal large language models that support tool calling for agentic problem solving, spanning both proprietary and open-source families: OpenAI GPT series (GPT-4o [14], GPT-5 [18]), Anthropic Claude series (Claude-4-Sonnet [2]), Google Gemini series (Gemini-2.5-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Pro) by Team et al. [19], Qwen3-VL series (Qwen3-VL-4B-Inst, Qwen3VL-8B-Inst, Qwen3-VL-32B-Inst, Qwen3-VL-235B-Inst, and their Thinking variants) by Yang et al. [29], and GLM-4.6v [34], etc. Testing Paradigm. We evaluate agents under two settings: with tools and without tools. In the with-tools setting, agents interact with tools via ReAct-style [30] loop, with tool interfaces adapted to each models native function-calling format (e.g., OpenAI tool schemas, GLMs tool format). In the without-tools setting, agents solve tasks using chain-of-thought prompting alone, serving as baseline to isolate the contribution of tool-use. Detailed inference settings and prompt templates are provided in Appendix E.1. Training hyperparameters. Using our execution-verified trajectories, we fine-tune Qwen3-VL-8B and Qwen3-VL-4B with SFT at different data scales. In the main results table, we report the bestperforming checkpoints: SciAgent-8B and SciAgent-4B trained on 11,074 trajectories. Full training settings and additional runs are provided in Appendix E.2 . SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Figure 4 Failure analysis in SciAgentBench.

(Right) Error recovery rates over step intervals. 6.2. RQ1: Can current models handle long-horizon, multi-modal scientific tasks? Table 3 presents evaluation results on SciAgentBench. Our primary goal is to examine how models leverage scientific tools when confronted with complex problems that cannot be solved through parametric knowledge or simple reasoning alone. Based on the experimental results, we draw the following key findings: Current models struggle with long-horizon, multi-modal scientific tasks. Performance degrades substantially as task complexity increases. Across all models, accuracy drops sharply from L1 to L3 difficulty levels. For instance, GPT-5 declines from 60.6% (L1) to 30.9% (L3), and Claude-Sonnet-4 drops from 55.6% to just 16.9%. On average, models achieve 46.4% on L1 tasks but only 14.7% on L3 tasks, representing 68% relative performance degradation. This trend holds consistently across both closed-source and open-source models, indicating that current models face fundamental challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence over extended multi-step scientific workflows. Tool Augmentation Remains Essential for Scientific Problem Solving. Our results underscore that tool-augmented reasoning is not merely beneficial but essential for tackling complex scientific problems. For standard instruction-following models, the interactive ReAct paradigm yields substantial improvements: Claude-Sonnet-4 improves from 22.4% to 35.9% with tools, while SciAgent-8B gains +6.8%. Similarly, models equipped with reinforced chain-of-thought capabilities (Thinking) benefit from tool integration: Qwen3-VL-235B-Think and Qwen3-VL-32B-Think achieve gains of +3.6% and +3.5% respectively. These findings suggest that pure reasoning cannot fully substitute for the computational precision and domain-specific functionality that external tools provide, highlighting the continued importance of tool-augmented frameworks in scientific problem-solving environments. Performance Varies Significantly Across Disciplines. Models generally perform better on Physics and Chemistry than on Life Sciences and Materials Science. Life Sciences exhibits strong tool dependency: the average improvement is +2.5% for Physics, +7.0% for Chemistry, +3.7% for Materials Science, and +8.4% for Life Sciences, as summarized in Appendix A. Our analysis reveals that many Life Science tasks necessitate precise tool execution, such as database queries and specialized computations, which lie beyond the capabilities of pure parametric reasoning. An illustrative Life Sciences case study is provided in Appendix F.3. 9 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents 6.3. RQ2: What Failure Patterns Emerge in Multi-step Scientific Tool-use? We investigate failure mechanisms in multi-step scientific tool orchestration. Our analysis reveals weak models fall into invocation loops due to broken error-handling pipelines, resulting in fragile trajectory-level recovery dynamics. Excessive Tool Invocation Loop. First, we observe distinct efficiency gap. As shown in Figure 4 (left), there is weak negative correlation (𝑟 = 0.18) between tool usage frequency and task success. For instance, Qwen3-VL-8B-Inst averages 16.55 tool calls yet achieves only 23.4% accuracy, whereas GPT-5 reaches 41.3% with merely 3.41 calls. Detailed analysis reveals that weaker models frequently enter repetitive tool-calling loops, re-invoking similar tools without reducing uncertainty (see Appendix F.4). In contrast, top-performing models exhibit high information yield per call, solving complex workflows with targeted, sparse invocations. Targeted scientific tool-use training mitigates this inefficiency. Our fine-tuned model reduces average tool calls while improving tool-augmented accuracy by about 7% , demonstrating that supervision on scientific trajectories enhances the capability to resolve problems via scientific tools while significantly curtailing redundant invocations. Breakdown in Process-Level Feedback. To understand why models fall into these repetitive loops, we analyze 6,617 error instances to identify where the reasoning process breaks down. We measure recovery capability using four metrics: Adaptation (responsiveness to error), Tuning (parameter refinement), Switching (strategic pivoting), and Loop Escape (1 rate of identical repetition). Detailed calculations are provided in Appendix C.3. As shown in Figure 4 (middle), we report the distribution of these four metrics across all models (where higher is better). Results reveal widespread failures across all stages: Adaptation shows median response rate of only 32.9%, indicating that models ignore the majority of error signals; Tuning rates are even lower at 6.6%, suggesting models fail to diagnose and fix specific parameter errors; successful strategic Switching occurs in only 15.3% of cases. Compounding these failures, the Loop Escape rate remains low at 35.7%. This chain of failures creates critical bottleneck. Lacking the ability to interpret feedback or fix their actions, models inevitably revert to the repetitive tool usage described earlier. Trajectory-Level Recovery Dynamics. Finally, we examine how error-handling capabilities change over long tasks. We define the Recovery Rate as the probability that model successfully performs correct action immediately after making mistake. Measuring this across steps reveals two different patterns. As shown in Figure 4 (right), strong models display Rise-Fall-Rise pattern: Claude-Sonnet4s recovery rate increases from 40% (steps 23) to 57% (steps 67), drops to 9% (steps 89), then rebounds to 63% (steps 1012). This pattern suggests that even top models encounter difficult phases mid-trajectory, but crucially, they can escape and restore effective error correction. Weaker models lack this resilience. Qwen3-VL-8B declines monotonically from 29% to 10% and remains low thereafter. Once these models enter error traps, they remain stuck. The critical differentiator is not whether models attempt incorrect tools, but whether they can break free from the resulting error loops. This recovery capability is fundamental for robust multi-step scientific tool-use. 6.4. RQ3: What Makes Scientific Tool-use Training Effective? Building on evidence that fine-tuning significantly improves scientific tool-use capabilities, as shown in Figure 4(left), we now investigate which training design choices contribute to these gains through systematic ablation studies. 10 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Model Phys.

We report toolaugmented (ReAct) Success Rate (SR, %) by subject. Arrows indicate change from Qwen3-VL-8B. Key findings: error trajectories are essential, generic tools cause negative transfer, and scientific skills transfer across domains. Figure 5 Scaling behavior: Tool-augmented (ReAct) performance improves with data size, while tool-free reasoning saturates early, highlighting the value of large-scale tool-use trajectories. Scientific tool-use is domain-specific yet transferable. To test whether generic tool-use data can substitute for scientific tools, we fine-tune Qwen3-VL-8B on non-scientific tools (e.g., web search, file operations, calendar APIs). As shown in Table 4, this other-domain fine-tuning leads to 4.6 point drop in overall score relative to the base model, indicating negative transfer. In contrast, within the scientific tool space, we observe consistent cross-disciplinary transfer: models fine-tuned on single discipline demonstrate improved performance in other scientific domains. Our detailed analysis in Appendix F.2 reveals that unlike generic baselines, scientific tool tuning instills rigorous paradigms such as constraint checking and numerical precision. This confirms that scientific data is indispensable for cultivating both domain-grounded behaviors and transferable meta-skills that generalize across disciplines. Error recovery trajectories are essential. We compare Qwen3-VL-8B-Merged trained on full trajectories with error recovery to Qwen3-VL-8B-NoError trained only on clean trajectories. Table 4 shows that Qwen3-VL-8B-NoError underperforms across most subjects. This performance gap indicates that exposure to failure-correction sequences is important for robust tool-use. Tool-use capabilities scale more readily than static SFT knowledge. Finally, we examine how performance scales with training data under tool-augmented versus tool-free evaluation. Figure 5 tracks success rates across training checkpoints. Tool-augmented Success Rate improves steadily as we add more training samples, while tool-free performance saturates early and plateaus despite continued training. This contrast suggests that tool-use behaviors are more data-scalable: additional trajectories teach models better interaction patterns, verification habits, and error handling. In contrast, the static knowledge and reasoning acquired through SFT alone appears harder to scale with more data. These findings support the value of large-scale tool-augmented training data for building capable scientific agents, as tool integration enables continued performance gains that are beyond the reach of internal textual reasoning. 7. Conclusion In this work, we introduce SciAgentGym and SciAgentBench, shifting scientific evaluation from static knowledge to dynamic, tool-augmented reasoning. Analysis reveals that while tools are essential, current models struggle with long-horizon workflows, often failing to recover from errors. Thus, 11 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents we propose SciForge, an execution-grounded synthesis method generating logic-aware data from real interactions. Training on these verified trajectories enables our 8B model to outperform 200B+ baselines. By providing reproducible infrastructure and scalable synthesis, we hope this work can lay the foundation for future scientific agents."

Details of Taxonomy Organization To improve tool discoverability and composability in multi-step tool-chains, we organize tools along two orthogonal axes: function and granularity. The function axis groups tools by their primary role in scientific workflow (query, computation, analysis, visualization), while the granularity axis distinguishes atomic primitives from composite operations. This taxonomy is consistent with our layered architecture (Atomic Composite Visualization).

            "content": "1. Input Serialization (𝛼𝑣 𝑖 float, bool) or standard collections (List, Dict). Internal Construction: Complex objects (e.g., rdkit.Chem.Mol, pymatgen.Structure, Handling). All inputs must be JSON-serializable primitives (str, int, scipy.sparse.csr_matrix) must be reconstructed inside the tool from serializable identifiers such as SMILES strings, POSCAR text, file paths, or database IDs. Boundary Checks: Each tool must validate types, ranges, and special cases (e.g., zero/extreme values) before executing scientific logic. 2. Output Encapsulation (𝛽𝑣 𝑗 Handling). All results must be returned in unified dictionary schema to preserve scientific context. Standard Return: {result: main_value, metadata: {...}} (e.g., units, status flags, data sources). Large/Non-serializable Data: High-dimensional or non-serializable outputs (e.g., sparse matrices) must be persisted under ./mid_result/{subject}/ (e.g., physics/chemistry/materials). The returned summary must include filepath, shape, nnz, and sparsity. 3. Quality and Traceability Requirements. Type Hints: All tools must provide complete Python type hints for parameters and return values. Scientific Metadata: Metadata should include units and relevant diagnostic information (e.g., convergence status, databases used) to support reproducible tool-chains. Table 7 Executable interface specifications for SciAgentGym tools: input serialization requirements, output encapsulation schema, and traceability constraints for compatibility with LLM function-calling interfaces. C. Benchmark Construction Details C.1. Benchmark Construction We reuse the same source-benchmark pool and curation pipeline as SciAgentGym for raw task collection . All components of the pipeline remain identical to Appendix B, except for the difficulty filtering stage, where we replace the original filtering model with GPT-5[18], Claude-Sonnet-4.5[3], Gemini-2.5-Pro[19], and DeepSeek-R1[5], as detailed in Appendix B.3 We construct our benchmark with two subsets: unimodal dataset and multimodal dataset, where each question may be paired with one or more images. For every instance, we provide both reference solution and structured intermediate decomposition, enabling the evaluation of multi-step reasoning beyond final-answer correctness. Crucially, both subsets are annotated with expert tool-use trajectories that define the intended sequence of tool invocations required to solve each problem. When applicable, we further include canonical tool inputs and their corresponding outputs, allowing for reproducible tool execution and fine-grained supervision of tool-augmented reasoning. This trajectory-centric design supports not only success-based evaluation but also efficiency-aware metrics, such as SPL (Success weighted by Path Length), which weights successful solutions by their tool-use length relative to the expert reference. Figure 8 illustrates representative expert trajectory. C.2. Interpretation Note. We acknowledge that scientific problem-solving often admits multiple valid solution paths. Our golden traces represent one expert-verified execution strategy, not necessarily the unique optimal solution. Consequently, SPL measures alignment with the reference strategy rather than absolute planning optimality. An agent achieving lower SPL may have taken an alternative valid approach rather than an inefficient one. We retain SPL as it provides consistent, reproducible baseline for cross-model 18 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Tool Taxonomy: Organization by Function and Granularity 1. Function Axis (Workflow Role). Tools are organized by their primary role in the scientific workflow: query, computation, analysis, and visualization. Query: Retrieve hierarchical facts/records from external resources or local indices and return normalized fields for downstream steps. Example: fetch_property_from_database(identifier, property_name) Computation: Execute core scientific calculations or model components under strict boundary checks, producing unit-aware results and/or persisted artifacts when needed. Example: construct_hamiltonian(params, ...) Analysis: Perform post-processing and higher-level interpretation over computed/retrieved artifacts (e.g., diagnostics, aggregation, comparisons, error/uncertainty handling). Example: analyze_commutator(matrix_a, matrix_b) Visualization: Generate domain-specific scientific figures; the tool must persist figures and return references to generated artifacts for downstream use. Example: visualize_domain_specific(data, vis_type, ...) 2. Granularity Axis (Atomic to Composite). Tools are further organized by operational granularity, from atomic primitives to composite operations. Atomic primitives: Single-responsibility functions with minimal side effects and stable interfaces; intended as reusable building blocks. Composite operations: Higher-level procedures that orchestrate multiple atomic primitives into complete workflow (not simple concatenation), while preserving traceable intermediate states. Table 8 Tool taxonomy used in SciAgentGym, organizing tools along two axes: workflow function (query, computation, analysis, visualization) and operational granularity (atomic primitives vs. composite operations), with representative function examples. comparison, while recognizing this limitation in interpretation. C.3. Feedback Utilization Failure Taxonomy Adaptation. Whether the model changes its action after receiving an error signal. Adaptation = 𝑃(𝑎𝑡+1 𝑎𝑡 𝑦𝑡 = fail) (8) Tuning. Whether the model successfully fixes the error by retrying the same tool with corrected inputs. Tuning = 𝑃( 𝑦𝑡+1 = success Ctune) (9) where Ctune = { 𝑦𝑡 = fail, 𝑎𝑡+1 𝑎𝑡, tool𝑡+1 = tool𝑡}. Switching. Whether the model successfully resolves the error by switching to different tool or reasoning strategy. where Cswitch = { 𝑦𝑡 = fail, 𝑎𝑡+1 𝑎𝑡, tool𝑡+1 tool𝑡}. Switching = 𝑃( 𝑦𝑡+1 = success Cswitch) Loop Escape. Whether the model avoids repeating the exact same failed action. Loop Escape = 1 𝑃(𝑎𝑡+1 = 𝑎𝑡, 𝑦𝑡+1 = fail 𝑦𝑡 = fail) (10) (11) 19 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Interpretation. These four metrics form diagnostic pipeline for feedback utilization: Adaptation tests whether the model notices the error and attempts any change. Tuning tests whether the model can fix the error using the same tool. Switching tests whether the model can circumvent the error via alternative strategies. Loop Escape tests whether the model avoids falling into repetitive failure patterns. C.4. Data Annotation and Quality Review Process To ensure reliability and evaluability during benchmark construction, we conduct human quality review on all samples , verifying clarity and unambiguity, the logical correctness of step-by-step reasoning and tool-call ordering, the consistency of tool outputs via recomputation, the correctness of final answers, and compliance with the benchmark template. Each item receives at least one full end-to-end check, and complex cases are double-reviewed; workloads are distributed over 3060 day period to reduce fatigue-induced errors. D. Execution-Grounded Synthesis D.1. Algorithm Details complete pseudocode description of the backward program construction process is presented in Algorithm 1. E. Experimental Settings E.1. Evaluation Details We evaluate OpenAI-compatible chat-completion models under ReAct-style protocol, comparing with tools and without tools settings. In the with tools setting, only task-relevant tools are exposed, each defined via the OpenAI tool schema (name, description, JSON-schema parameters). The model follows system prompt enforcing two-stage Planning Execution procedure with explicit Thought ActionObservation loops  (Table 9)  ; for the reverse setting, convergence prompt enforces strict JSON outputs  (Table 10)  . In the without tools setting, tools are disabled and the model outputs reasoning trace followed by boxed final answer  (Table 11)  . Inference and Decoding Configuration. Unless otherwise stated, all models are evaluated using temperature of 0.7, following standard deployment settings. For tool-enabled runs, we set tool_choice = \"auto\" and parallel_tool_calls = false, cap tool interactions at 50 rounds per attempt, and enforce per-request timeout of 300 seconds. To ensure robust evaluation against strict formats, we employ final answer normalization step. As detailed in Table 12, this prompts the model to convert its final response into strict, task-specific JSON template, ensuring that numeric literals and boolean values adhere to the required schema for automated scoring. Metrics and Verification. We evaluate outputs using strict hierarchical accuracy, recursively matching the predicted JSON against ground truth with numeric tolerance of 0.05. To mitigate brittleness in long-form text fields, we employ an LLM-based semantic verification step using gpt-4.1 when strict matching fails solely on textual fields. The system prompt for this verifier, which enforces binary scoring mechanism based on strict rubrics, is provided in Table 13. Additionally, specific judge prompts for semantic equivalence and binary correctness checks are detailed in Table 14.

Training details This appendix provides details on our fine-tuning setup, including trace generation, hyperparameters, and runtime safeguards, using the same prompt structures described in the evaluation settings. Training Trace Generation. For supervised fine-tuning, we generate refined tool-use traces using function-calling agent empowered to autonomously manage tool invocations (tool_ choice=\"auto\"). To ensure robust reasoning, generation is performed with temperature of 0.3, capping interactions at 50 rounds per attempt. This is immediately followed by the normalization stage (temperature 0.1) detailed in Table 12, which coerces the final output into strict, task-specific JSON format. The resulting trajectoriescomprising serialized tool_call and tool_response messages along with the normalized answerserve as the training targets. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). We fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct backbone using fullparameter SFT for 3 epochs. The training infrastructure leverages DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, gradient checkpointing, and FlashAttention to maximize efficiency. To maintain the pre-trained multimodal alignment stability, we explicitly freeze the vision backbone and the projector modules (freeze_vit=true, freeze_aligner=true), updating only the language model parameters. The SFT setup uses learning rate of 1 106 in bfloat16 precision, with maximum sequence length of 16384, batch size 2 per device, and gradient accumulation of 4 on 8 GPUs. 21 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents"

Case study F.1. Thin-Film Interference: Full Trace vs. Expert Reference For thin-film interference, we juxtapose an end-to-end interaction trace that contains partial tool-call failures (Figure 7) with the corresponding expert reference workflow (Figure 8), which integrates analytic derivation and numerical/visual verification. F.2. Controlled Model Comparison on the Same Problem Instance Figure 9 contrasts two Qwen3-VL-8B variants on the same truss permissible-load task. The tool-tuned variant satisfies key task constraints by explicitly evaluating both force directions and returning complete two-part answer, while reporting numerically stable values consistent with the tool outputs. By comparison, the generic baseline expends additional calls on auxiliary steps yet violates the output constraint by omitting required parts, despite having computed relevant intermediate quantities. F.3. Life-Science Case Study Figure 10 provides representative Life Sciences trace in which solving the plasmid-replacement task requires precise tool executionnotably database-backed queries for plasmid properties (e.g., copy number, origin, resistance) and downstream difficulty/strategy computationbefore valid protocol-level plan can be composed. F.4. Failure Modes We observe two recurring failure patterns in tool-augmented scientific reasoning. One is degenerate tool-use loops: in Case 67, the model repeatedly re-invokes the same shear-stress subroutine without updating the governing torque or applying the allowable-stress constraints, eventually exhausting the round budget (Figure 11). closely related degeneration appears in the mass-spectrometry setting: Case 53 shows that weaker models may either fail to follow the required tool-call format or collapse into repetitive peak-extraction attempts with identical outputs, and later even degrade to invalid empty arguments that trigger validation errors (Figure 12). The second pattern is formula-level errors that survive despite otherwise plausible reasoning. In Case 68, representative failure produces structurally incorrect closed form (e.g., an unnecessary functional transformation) while the correct expression is comparatively simple, illustrating that near-miss analytical mistakes remain major source of incorrect answers (Figure 13). 26 SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents Case 05 claude-sonnet-4-20250514 Problem: White light is incident normally on thin film with refractive index 𝑛2 = 1.4.

The main challenge lies in the high copy number of pUC18 (approximately 500 copies), which must be completely eliminated in order to successfully transition to the low-copy-number plasmid pACYC184 (approximately 15 copies). The recommended procedure includes: (1) curing the source plasmid pUC18 using chemical agents or temperature treatment; (2) verifying plasmid loss by PCR or antibiotic sensitivity testing; (3) introducing pACYC184 using high-efficiency transformation method; (4) selecting transformants on tetracycline-containing medium; and (5) confirming successful transformation by colony PCR. The entire process typically requires 57 days, with an estimated success rate of approximately 60%.

The right end of the component is constrained as fixed end, and the left end is welded integrally with rigid circular disc. The length of the component is 𝑙. Before applying the external load, there is no stress inside the rod and tube. torsional couple 𝑀e is applied to the rigid circular disc at the left end (as shown in the figure as vector 𝑴e). It is given that 𝑑1 = 50 mm, 𝑑2 = 60 mm, 𝐷2 = 76 mm, 𝑙 = 500 mm; shear modulus of steel 𝐺1 = 77 GPa, allowable shear stress [𝜏]1 = 120 MPa; shear modulus of aluminum 𝐺2 = 27 GPa, allowable shear stress [𝜏]2 = 70 MPa.
