            "content": "Social media platforms play an increasingly central role in shaping and reflecting public discourse. Historically, Twitter (now X) has served as core dataset for researchers studying online behavior, public opinion, and effective communication (Bruns & Burgess, 2013; Das & Dutta, 2020; Das et al., 2019, 2021; Kwak et al., 2010). However, recent API restrictions (Center for an Informed Public at UW, 2023) have severely limited access for academic and open-source communities. As result, attention has shifted toward decentralized platforms such as Bluesky (Quelle & Bovet, 2025), which offer greater data openness and user autonomy. While historical datasets like the Twitter Stream Grab remain valuable, many tools built around them are outdated or constrained in functionality. Tools like TweetViz, TExVis, and Gephi provide partial solutions but lack the scalability, usability, or analytical depth necessary for contemporary narrative analysis (Al Hariri et al., 2024). TwiXplorer (Al Hariri et al., 2024) advanced the field by combining sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and visualization in an interactive dashboard, but remains limited to static archives of Twitter (X) data. CognitiveSky extends this paradigm into the As shown in real-time and decentralized space. it builds upon the principles demonstrated Table 1, introducing modular, open-source in TwiXplorer, labeling, and summarizing framework for ingesting, Bluesky discourse. Unlike static analysis tools, CognitiveSky operates continuously on live data, supports transformer-based sentiment and emotion detection, and produces structured JSON summaries for interactive visualization. CognitiveSky is designed to be lightweight, Its modular architecture low-cost, and scalable. supports adaptation across range of domains; from mental health discourse, where emotionally expressive and time-sensitive narratives are common (De Choudhury et al., 2013; Guntuku et al., 2017), to areas like disinformation detection, civic engagement, In the sections that follow, we and crisis response.

System Overview CognitiveSky is structured as fully open-source modular pipeline1for streaming, labeling, enriching, and visualizing discourse data from the decentralized Bluesky platform.

            "content": "The ingestion pipeline operates 24/7 on lightweight Oracle Cloud Virtual Machine (Corporation, 2025) using Node.js. It connects to the AT Protocol Firehose via WebSocket (Kleppmann et al., 2024) and listens for app.bsky.feed.post events, which represent newly published public posts on the Bluesky network. To filter for relevant content, CognitiveSky applies keyword-based heuristic using array of English-language expressions as keywords. These patterns are compiled into case-insensitive regular expressions and evaluated in real time using JavaScript-based matcher. Posts that pass the filter are transformed into structured objects containing metadata such as post ID, user decentralized identifiers (DID), timestamp, raw text, and optional fields like language tags and 1The full source code including ingestion, labeling pipeline, interactive dashboard, and, GitHub Actions based automation is available at https://github.com/gauravfs-14/CognitiveSky, licensed under MIT. embedded media. These records are held in an in-memory buffer and batch-inserted into Supabase (Supabase, 2025) every 5 seconds or after 200 posts, with retry mechanism that discards records after three failed attempts. Supabase acts as transient staging layer between ingestion and labeling. graceful shutdown handler ensures buffered data is flushed to persistent storage on termination. Unlike traditional pipelines, CognitiveSky defers cleaning to the annotation stage, where text is normalized, URLs and mentions removed, and posts validated for minimum content before NLP processing. 2.2. Data Labeling Posts in the Supabase buffer are processed by labeling pipeline written in Python, triggered daily by GitHub Action workflow (GitHub, 2025). This component loads posts in batches of up to 64, enabling safe memory usage in CI environments. It assigns each post affective and semantic labels using transformer models and topic clustering. assigning one of Sentiment classification is performed using from CardiffNLP (Barbieri RoBERTa-based model three polarities: et al., 2020), positive, neutral, or negative. Emotion detection follows using DistilRoBERTa model trained on the GoEmotions dataset (Hartmann, 2022), which identifies categories like joy, For each post x, contextual embedding is extracted from the special classification token, denoted as [CLS], which represents an aggregated summary of the input sequence. This embedding is passed through softmax classifier: fear, and anger. Ë†y = softmax(W CLS(x) + b) These models are optimized for short-form, informal Figure 1. End-to-end overview of CognitiveSkys modular pipeline. text and trained using cross-entropy loss. Intermediate memory is explicitly released between batches to avoid exhaustion in constrained CI contexts. Following the emotion detection, the textual content of each post is vectorized using the TF-IDF method (Salton & Buckley, 1988) to capture salient lexical features. Topic clustering is subsequently performed using MiniBatch Non-negative Matrix Factorization (Lee & Seung, 1999), which decomposes the TF-IDF matrix to assign each post to dominant topic (e.g., topic 2). For interpretability, the most representative keywords for each topic cluster are extracted and retained for visualization in the dashboard. Final annotations are stored in Turso (libSQL) database (Turso, 2025) using an insert or ignore policy to prevent duplication. Once inserted, the corresponding records are purged from Supabase, preserving pipeline throughput and preventing redundant processing. 2.3. Real-time Interactive Dashboard To support time-aware and interpretable analysis, CognitiveSky aggregates labeled records from the Turso database into structured JSON summaries2. These snapshots, generated daily and weekly, encode the temporal, affective, and topical dimensions of the in-memory aggregation Snapshot generation combines SQL-based dataset. routines. querying with Temporal summaries capture daily counts of posts, sentiment shifts, and emotional variation. Topic summaries include cluster frequency, representative keywords, and associated emotional context. Hashtags and emojis are extracted using regular expressions, with co-occurrence graphs built from within-post pairings. dedicated meta file tracks global metrics such as total posts, unique users, and top-used terms. CognitiveSkys dashboard functions as the primary interface for exploring mental health discourse on Bluesky. Built with Next.js and Recharts and deployed via Vercel3, is powered entirely by static JSON serverless allowing low-latency access, snapshots, architecture, and zero dependency on live database queries. it The dashboard is modular by design, with views The mapped directly to individual snapshot files. landing page presents holistic overview of dataset activity, including post volume, top emotions, trending hashtags, and language usage (Figure 2 illustrates some components of the interface).

This approach aligns with prevailing ethical standards concerning the use of publicly available data for computational analysis. CognitiveSky references user accounts solely via DIDs. These DIDs are intrinsic to the Bluesky protocol and are not enriched with or mapped to any external identity sources or platforms. Importantly, the system does not display or expose individual-level posts at any point in the user interface, analytic dashboard, All or in downloadable datasets. textual data is retained and processed exclusively for the purposes of aggregate statistical and thematic analysis. Posts are abstracted into categories such as topic clusters, sentiment distributions, or engagement patterns, with no individual post text, metadata, or identifiers ever being surfaced or shared. 3. Technology Optimizations CognitiveSky is architected as lightweight, modular, and reproducible pipeline optimized for real-time decentralized data analysis. Each layer of the system, from ingestion to labeling to visualization, was designed to operate autonomously using only open-source and free-tier infrastructure. At core, we are utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript for data collection and visualization, Python-based pipeline for data labeling and processing, and GitHub actions as CI layer, enabling automated daily running of the Python-based pipeline.

Use Case: Mental Health Narratives is as designed Although CognitiveSky general-purpose framework for analyzing decentralized social media discourse, its initial deployment focuses on the domain of mental health. The decision to prioritize mental health stems from the growing concern about the rise of anxiety, depression, and emotional distress expressed online, particularly among younger populations who are early adopters of platforms like Bluesky (Pew Research Center, 2025). Mental healthrelated discussions on social media, like other sensitive topics, often carry heightened emotional intensity and subtle contextual cues, with implicit signals that may point to underlying distress or calls for help requiring timely recognition and response (Chancellor & De Choudhury, 2020; Das et al., 2024). These characteristics make them an ideal testbed for CognitiveSkys NLP-driven labeling and visual analysis pipeline. The system enables researchers to capture not just what users are discussing, but how they feel, when they engage, and what kinds of language or cultural markers they use to express emotional states. In this use case, CognitiveSky continuously monitors the Bluesky Firehose for public posts containing mental health-related keywords such as depression, therapy, panic attack, burnout, or healing. These posts are streamed in real time to Supabase and then labeled using transformer models to assign sentiment and emotion categories. Once labeled, the posts are analyzed for daily trends, emotional composition, and associated hashtags or emojis. 5. Replicable Framework and Other Use"

Conclusions We introduced CognitiveSky, an open-source, real-time system for detecting, labeling, and visualizing discourse trends on the decentralized Bluesky network. Built with modularity, reproducibility, and accessibility at its core, CognitiveSky bridges the gap between large-scale data ingestion and structured narrative analysis. By applying state-of-the-art NLP models to live social streams and pairing results with lightweight summarization and visualization, the system enables timely interpretation of public sentiment, emotion, and topic dynamics. mental health case study highlighted its ability to capture nuanced emotional expressions and evolving themes within online communities. choices CognitiveSkys (e.g., architectural free-tier deployment, serverless infrastructure, static dashboarding, and modular pipelines) allow it to This makes operate without costly infrastructure. researchers, the system particularly well-suited for civic organizations, and journalists who seek to investigate discourse on decentralized platforms. However, the current pipeline relies on English-only models, real-time scalability is constrained by rate limits and API policies, and static dashboards restrict interactivity and customization. Moreover, data volatility on decentralized networks replicability and long-term presents challenges for validation. limitations remain: and advanced expansion, user-centric Future work should focus on multilingual and cross-cultural narrative-shift detection, semantic clustering for more robust topic tracking, analysis. Interactive and adaptive dashboards could enhance transparency while exploration of results.
