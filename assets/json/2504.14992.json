            "content": "Recent years have witnessed the breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) [24, 31, 33, 34, 51, 52] across various domains [6, 19, 27, 54]. Apart from the early success of scaling in parameters and training data [9, 16, 22, 28] in the pre-training stage, the recent success of Deepseek-R1 [18] and OpenAI-o1/o3 [38, 39] have stimulated researches on length scaling during the post-training stage. By employing RL methods including PPO [44] or GRPO [46], model learns length scaling by generating very long chain-of-thought (COT) [55] sequences before giving the final answers, leading to remarkable improvement on Olympiadlevel math and reasoning problems including American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) and GPQA [41]. Given the great success of length scaling in post-training, researchers have also been studying length scaling in the pre-training stage. Early work on chain-of-thought reasoning [55] inspires methods that insert plain text into pre-training sequences either through manual design [17] or online exploration [59]. Recently, under the concept of converting discrete signals into continuous representations, Coconut [20] proposes inserting latent embeddings rather than plain text. CoTFormer [36] achieves an implicit 2 pre-training length scaling by reusing hidden embeddings from earlier layers for single token. In contrast, COCOMix [48] emphasizes the interpretability of intermediate hidden states and projects them into continuous concepts. 1 (a) Training loss. (b) HellaSwag accuracy. (c) Prefilling time. (d) Decoding latency. Figure 1 The length scaling curve on 151M sized model. We repeat the training sequence 1/2/3/4 times on the same model architecture and train them for 100B tokens. The training loss and downstream accuracy scale robustly w.r.t. the token repeating times. Although these pioneer researches are proven effective, they have limited applicability, as their marginal improvements in reasoning benchmarks are achieved at the cost of increased KV cache size and higher decoding latency. Moreover, distracted by post-processing the middle layer hidden states in various ways, the innate pre-training length scaling phenomenon is never explored. More essentially, we present that length scaling can also be achieved in pre-training. Unlike previous works [36, 48], we simply repeat the input tokens 1/2/3/4 times without post-processing on middle layer hidden states. We observe both the loss scaling and performance scaling trend w.r.t. the token repeating times, which is shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b. However, naively repeating input tokens incurs significant inefficiencies in inference. The key obstacle arises from the linearly increased KV cache size due to token repetition, which introduces both memory pressure from the KV cache footprint, super linear increase in pre-filling time (shown in Figure 1c), and linear increase in decoding latency (shown in Figure 1d). To address these challenges, We present novel inference-friendly length scaling approach. Our key contribution is the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (PHD-Transformer), which maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. The PHD-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy. Specifically, denote the first tokens as original tokens, and the repeated tokens as hidden decoding tokens, we exclusively retain the KV cache generated from original tokens for long-range dependency modeling and immediately discard the KV cache of hidden decoding tokens after their use in next-token prediction. This approach provides an identical KV cache size to the vanilla Transformer while delivering substantial inference acceleration compared to naive token repeating (shown in Figure 1d). To better preserve the performance benefits from the KV cache of hidden decoding tokens, we introduce PHD-SWA (Sliding Window Attention). This variant maintains local sliding window cache of these tokens, achieving notable performance improvements while requiring only O(1) additional KV cache memory. However, we notice that the KV cache of hidden decoding tokens exhibits sequential dependencies in PHD-SWA, which leads to linear increase in the pre-filling time. To address this, we propose PHD-CSWA (Chunk-wise Sliding Window Attention), which restricts the sequential dependencies within each chunk. Therefore, PHD-CSWA significantly reduces the pre-filling time as only the pre-filling time of the last chunk is linearly increased (shown in Figure 1c). In summary, we propose our parallel hidden decoding-transformer series, including PHD, PHD-SWA, and PHD-CSWA. To our knowledge, this work first presents the topic of efficient pre-training length scaling. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose our PHD-Transformer series, which not only demonstrates the effectiveness of length scaling but also provides novel solutions to prevent the linear growth of KV cache size. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our PHD-Transformer series delivers substantial accuracy improvements across multiple benchmarks while maintaining acceptable 2 Figure 2 Overview of the transformer block in PHD. Specifically, the input tokens are repeated multiple times fed into the transformer block simultaneously. The original tokens generate KV cache that can be attended to by all the following tokens, while the hidden decoding tokens only generate KV cache that can be attended to within the current tokens (Token 3 in the Figure). computational overhead in both the pre-filling and decoding phases."

            "title": "4.1 Sparse Attention Mechanisms",
            "content": "Sparse attention techniques aim to reduce the quadratic complexity of attention by focusing on the most informative token interactions. These approaches can be broadly categorized into three types, each with distinct relationships to our work: Fixed Pattern Sparse Attention. These methods use predefined patterns to constrain attention computation. Notable examples include sliding window attention in Mistral [24] and Phi-3 [1], which restrict attention to local contexts; dilated attention [8, 15, 47], which attends to tokens at increasing intervals; and mixed 8 patterns as seen in Longformer [3] and BigBird [58], which combine local attention with global tokens. While our PHDshares the use of predefined attention patterns, particularly in our PHD-SWAvariant which employs sliding window attention for hidden decoding tokens, we uniquely apply these patterns only to the repeated tokens, maintaining full attention for the original tokens and thus preserving model quality while gaining efficiency. Data-Dependent Sparse Attention. Unlike fixed patterns, these approaches dynamically determine attention patterns based on input characteristics. Quest [50] proposes data-dependent block-wise sparse attention that adaptively selects blocks based on token-block similarity. Other examples include SpAtten [53] and SparQ [42], which leverage the dynamic nature of attention to predict sparse patterns. While these methods offer adaptive flexibility, they introduce substantial overhead in estimating the sparse patterns, limiting their effectiveness for long-context scenarios. In contrast, our PHD approach uses static patterns that require no runtime estimation overhead, making it more suitable for practical deployment while still achieving performance improvements through increased computational depth. Training-Native Sparse Attention. To address the inconsistency between training and inference in post-hoc sparse attention, Native Sparse Attention (NSA) [57] incorporates block sparse patterns during the training stage itself. This approach achieves improvements in both downstream performance and efficiency. Similar to NSA, our PHD method integrates efficient attention patterns during training, but unlike NSAs focus on general block sparsity, we specifically target hidden decoding tokens with tailored attention patterns, allowing us to maintain the same KV cache footprint as the original transformer while significantly improving performance."

            "title": "4.2 KV Cache Optimization",
            "content": "As models scale to handle longer contexts, KV cache management becomes increasingly critical for efficient inference: KV Cache Reduction. Various approaches attempt to reduce KV cache size, including H2O [61], which identifies and discards less important KV cache entries; StreamingLLM [56], which employs sink attention for handling streaming inputs; SnapKV [32], which merges similar tokens; and compression-based methods like LongLLMLingua [26, 40]. Unlike these methods which primarily focus on compressing existing KV caches post-hoc, our PHD approach fundamentally rethinks the relationship between computation and KV cache by sharing KV cache across repeated tokens, maintaining the same KV cache size as the original transformer while increasing computational depth for improved performance. KV Cache Management. Beyond reduction, effective management of the KV cache is crucial. PagedAttention [30] optimizes KV cache allocation and access patterns, while FlashDecoding [14] and FlashDecoding++ [23] enhance the efficiency of attention computations during decoding. Our PHD-Transformer complements these methods by focusing on the efficient utilization of the KV cache through controlled sharing patterns, and could potentially be combined with these management techniques for further efficiency gains. Attention Kernels and Hardware Optimization. Specialized attention implementations like FlashAttention series [12, 13, 45] and RingAttention [5, 35] optimize memory access patterns to accelerate attention computation. Our PHDapproach is orthogonal to these kernel optimizations and could leverage them for implementation, potentially providing compounded efficiency gains while addressing the core issue of scaling computational depth without proportional KV cache increases."

More recently, researchers [20, 36, 48] have converted these discrete thinking tokens to continuous signals and are proven effective beyond reasoning benchmarks. However, their applicability is largely limited due to the linear increase of KV cache size. Our proposed PHDalso leverages continuous signals, but introduces well-designed KV cache management to maintain an acceptable increase of KV cache, leading to applicability during inference. Recurrent Latent Thinking Layers. Another line of researches seek for recurrent approaches in reusing model parameters. Both Chen et al. [7], Geiping et al. [16] propose to use recurrent transformer block or transformer layer to scale the computation of decoding tokens, either statically or adaptively. However, recurrent models cannot be used in parallel generation, leading to limited efficiency during inference. In summary, our PHD-Transformer series introduce unique approach to model scaling by focusing on computational depth without proportional increases in KV cache size. By combining token repetition with efficient attention patterns specifically for hidden decoding tokens, PHD achieves performance scaling without the prohibitive memory costs typically associated with length scaling approaches. Leveraging insights from attention pattern analysis in works like MInference [25], we develop practical pretraining length scaling technique that addresses key bottleneck in current LLM inference where models are typically memory-bound rather than compute-bound."
