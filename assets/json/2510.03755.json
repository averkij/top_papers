            "title": "1 Introduction\nWith the increased use of AI in software engineering, developer\nworkflows are undergoing a fundamental transformation. Industry\nsurveys report widespread adoption of AI coding assistants [16],\nwith empirical studies demonstrating significant productivity gains;\nfor instance, GitHub Copilot users have been observed to complete\ntasks up to 55% faster [11]. Similarly, JetBrains reports that users\nsave up to 8 hours per week with its AI Assistant [8], and an Amazon\nstudy found that developers using CodeWhisperer completed tasks\n57% faster than those who did not [1].",
            "content": "While the benefits of these tools are evident [10], the study of interaction modalities and the wide-scale analysis of developer behavioral data remain limited. This is because the most powerful systems are commercial and closed-source, which presents three critical challenges for academic research: lack of transparency into the models decision-making processes, an inability to control experimental conditions (e.g., model versions or data sources), and no access to the rich telemetry data required for fine-grained analysis. Existing academic studies have often required the creation of bespoke, single-purpose tools, consequently restricting the ability to reuse the infrastructure [6] [9]. To address this gap, we propose Code4Me V2, an extensible and research-oriented framework for empirical analysis of AI-assisted software development. As an open-source plugin for JetBrains IDEs, Code4Me V2 provides core functionalities, such as inline code completion and an interactive chat assistant. Its primary purpose, however, is to serve as platform for experimentation. The architecture is explicitly modular, and it separates user-facing components from configurable data collection and model inference backend. We expect this tool to serve as useful infrastructure component for the AI4SE community. By offering shared, transparent, and extensible platform, Code4Me V2 enables researchers to focus on experimental design and data analysis rather than on building and maintaining their own data collection systems. In the subsequent sections, we analyze the domain in section 2, describe the design of Code4Me V2 in section 3, present preliminary analysis in section 4, and discuss limitations and future work in section 5. All relevant links for Code4Me V2 can be found at https://app.code4me.me."

            "content": "Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Koohestani et al. significant limitations for research. Platforms like GitHub Copilot [5], Cursor [3], and JetBrains AI [7] offer robust, integrated user experiences. However, their proprietary nature makes them effectively \"black boxes.\" Researchers cannot inspect the suggestion logic, control for model updates that could act as confounding variables, or access raw interaction data. Open-source alternatives, such as Cody [15] and Code4Me [6], offer more transparency but were not designed with research extensibility as primary goal. Their architectures often lack modularity, which complicates systematic studies of developerAI interaction. For example, adapting these systems to support different experimental configurations or data collection strategies typically requires substantial modification of the core codebase. To better understand these challenges, we analyzed seven widely used coding assistants and their documentation. 1 Finding that both commercial and open-source options fall short of research needs, we designed Code4Me V2 for the academic community, which is transparent, with an open-source platform from plugin to backend; controllable, giving researchers fine-grained control over data collection through modular system; and extensible, allowing new components such as telemetry modules or context providers to be added with minimal effort."

            "title": "3.2 Backend\nThe backend is a Python application built with modern, scalable\ntechnologies. The API is served by FastAPI [4], chosen for its asyn-\nchronous capabilities, which allow it to handle many concurrent\nrequests efficiently. A critical design choice was to decouple long-\nrunning tasks, such as LLM inference and persistence, from each\nother and from the main API request-response cycle. We achieve\nthis using Celery [14], a distributed task queue, with Redis [13]\nas a message broker. When a completion request arrives, the API\nimmediately places it on the task queue for both the inference\nengine and the database manager. A Celery worker picks up the\ntask, performs the model inference, and publishes the result. This\nasynchronous design ensures the user’s IDE never hangs while\nwaiting for irrelevant processes to the actual completion to finish.\nThe infrastructure provides support for both WebSocket and HTTP-\nbased requests, which in turn gives the front-end developer a lot of\nflexibility in how they want to implement features.",

            "title": "3.3 Frontend\nThe frontend architecture is central to Code4Me V2’s effectiveness\nas both a user-focused application and a research instrument. It\nis centered around a highly modular system. In the design, the\ncore unit is defined by a Module. A module can be responsible for\ncollecting data for the completion, running some update process,\nor running an arbitrary post-acceptance process. Modules follow a\nhierarchical system. To gain a better idea, the Module Manager is\nthe central coordinator that receives data collection requests from\nthe plugin’s main logic. Aggregators are modules that directly re-\nceive dispatched messages from the manager. These are responsible\nfor a specific class of data. Each aggregator invokes one or more\nindividual, self-contained Modules. For example, the Behavioral\nTelemetry Aggregator might call the Typing Speed and Time\nSince Last Completion modules. Keep in mind that Aggregators\nthemselves are modules, so this self-contained module can also be\nan aggregator. This composable structure allows researchers and\ndevelopers to have highly complex interaction systems.",
            "content": "This design makes the system exceptionally extensible. To add new piece of telemetry (e.g., tracking copy-paste events), researcher only needs to implement simple module interface and register it in the configuration. No other part of the system needs to be modified; this drastically lowers the engineering effort required to design new experiments. In line with the guiding principles of IntelliJ Action systems 2, actions initiated by the plugin occur exclusively when user submits completion request, whether inline or through the chat module. We classify module actions into two categories: the data collection loop and the after-insertion loop (these actually also correspond to two separate methods in the Module interface). These represent stages within the request lifecycle where modules can integrate and execute necessary actions. The complete lifecycle of this process is detailed in part of Figure 1. 1The platforms analyzed include: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cody, Devin, Replit Ghostwriter, Code4Me [6], and JetBrains AI. 2IntelliJ Action System principles Code4Me V2: Research-oriented Code-completion Platform Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Figure 1: Graphical depiction of the high-level architecture of Code4Me V2.

To assess the server-side latency, we create pipeline using recognized Fill-in-the-Middle task dataset 3 and continuously send requests to the server to measure the average delay. In the same manner, for the chat functionality, we use well-known program synthesis dataset 4 to instruct the model to clarify and execute the task, mimicking scenario where user is inquiring from within an IDE. For code completion, we use deepseek-coder-1.3b-base, and for the chat model, we use Ministral-8B-Instruct. End-to-end latency for code completion requests, from the trigger event in the IDE to the rendering of ghost text, is consistently 186.31 ms ( 139.50), with an average of 18.66 tokens, which is well within the threshold for non-disruptive user experience. For chat completions, the latency is 8369.78 ms ( 840.48) with an average of 277.08 tokens. To evaluate the plugins usability and research extensibility, we conducted two-phase user evaluation. First, formative user study was conducted with four expert researchers from the AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE) faculty. Participants were deliberately chosen based on their familiarity with AI4SE and their frequency of using AI coding assistants. They were then asked to complete basic multi-file programming task, which involved creating Shape interface and Circle and Rectangle implementing classes. During this task, they were expected to interact with both the inline completion and chat features. Feedback was gathered through semi-structured interview format and questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on three key areas: General Usability (e.g., relevance and timeliness of suggestions), Setup & Configuration (e.g., clarity of data collection settings), and Extensibility for Research (e.g., modifying the plugin for experiments). The qualitative feedback from this initial study strongly validated the platforms core premise: participants unanimously praised the modularity and extensibility, and expressed confidence in their ability to adapt the tool for their own research workflows. The study also identified areas for improvement, primarily regarding the intuitiveness of the module management UI and inconsistencies in the timing of automatic suggestions. Based on the results of this formative study, we made several iterations on the initial design. We then conducted secondary evaluation with four daily users using the same protocol. Our findings revealed that the individuals did not echo the issues previously identified by experts. Furthermore, fewer participants mentioned timing issues with the suggestions, experiencing fewer challenges with frequency and response time. Nonetheless, one user noted that the suggestions could benefit from slightly increased speed. Lastly, participant requested the inclusion of an Agent feature in the plugin, highlighting (1) rapidly evolving domain and (2) the necessity for quick adaptation from academia, the later of which is now facilitated by Code4Me V2."

While the platform is performant for research purposes, its completion speed and model quality do not yet match that of wellresourced commercial tools. The current context retrieval, while rather effective in single-file and multi-file settings, still requires attention to be on par with commercial counterparts. primary objective is the implementation of project-wide context retrieval to enhance the accuracy of code suggestions. Moreover, continuously improving and modifying the current framework is crucial to continue meeting the communitys needs (see the request for an agent feature in section 4). Therefore, we invite community members to engage with this project to ensure mutual benefit. We will be overseeing the repositories and welcome community contributions."
