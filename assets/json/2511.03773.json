            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted across broad range of tasks given their comprehensive pre-trained semantic knowledge. These agents have already shown promise in applications such as web navigation (Zhou et al.), embodied control (Shridhar et al.), and multiturn tool use (Yao et al., 2024). However, while these agents can leverage strong language priors to reason and plan, their performance in downstream interactive settings remains limited (Wang et al., 2024). As we step into the era of experience (Silver and Sutton, 2025), promising direction for building more robust and adaptive language agents is reinforcement learning (RL), where agents improve by interacting with environments and bootstrapping Figure 1 Compared to the traditional agent learning paradigm, DreamGym provides the first scalable and effective RL framework with unified infrastructure. 1 from their own experiences (Schulman et al., 2017), as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). Despite its potential, training LLM agents via RL remains highly challenging in practice. The most fundamental barrier is the high cost and low sample efficiency of collecting large-scale, diverse, and informative online interaction data (Wei et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025). Real environments often involve long interaction sequences, high computational cost per step, and sparse reward feedback, making it prohibitively expensive to gather sufficient amount of data for modern RL algorithms (Patil et al.; Shao et al., 2024). Beyond computational cost, there is also lack of diverse, scalable tasks, where most existing environments provide only limited, static set of instructions, while RL training requires broad range of tasks for effective exploration (Eysenbach et al., 2018). However, scaling task instructions is inherently difficult, as validating their feasibility often demands costly human expertise (Xue et al., 2025), leaving current environments insufficient for goal-conditioned RL. The third major barrier is the instability of reward signals. Many interactive settings, such as web pages and GUIs, are highly dynamic and lack consistent behaviors, resulting in noisy, sparse, or even false feedback that hinders stable learning (Deng et al., 2023). Safety concerns further compound these challenges, as certain actions are irreversible (e.g., deleting an item on real website), and most environments lack reliable reset mechanisms (Zhou et al.). Finally, the infrastructure difficulty of constructing RL-ready environments also remain challenging. Existing systems are heterogeneous and often rely on heavyweight backends like Docker (Jimenez et al.) or virtual machines (Xie et al., 2024b), making large-batch rollout sampling engineering-intensive and costly. These limitations make building general-purpose and scalable systems for training agents with RL an open and pressing challenge. To address these challenges, we propose DreamGym, unified and scalable RL framework that synthesizes diverse experience data in an online manner to enable efficient and effective training of LLM agents. At the core of DreamGym lies scalable reasoning-based experience model that abstracts environment dynamics into discrete textual space. By interacting with the agent over multiple turns, it produces consistent transitions and feedback that reflect the consequences of the agents actions through explicit reasoning. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to reproduce external systems (Chen et al., 2025; Assran et al., 2025), the design of the experience model is grounded in key insight that agent training does not require perfectly realistic environments, but rather interaction data that is sufficiently diverse, informative, and causally grounded to acquire knowledge for the target task. Therefore, powered by strong reasoning, the experience model overcomes the key limitations outlined above and delivers useful experience data for RL training. To ensure that synthetic experiences are diverse and informative, DreamGym equips the experience model with an experience replay buffer, from which it retrieves similar yet diverse trajectories to guide its current state prediction. This buffer is seeded with offline knowledge for essential context and is continuously enriched with trajectories generated on-the-fly, co-evolving the experience model with the agent to ensure the produced rollouts aligned with the agents updated policy for stable training. In parallel, the experience model serves as task generator, identifying valuable tasks with high reward entropy and producing progressively more challenging variations. This design yields an effective curriculum, where agents are consistently exposed to harder problems as their capability improves. By unifying interaction, memory, and adaptive online task generation, DreamGym addresses the persistent challenges that have limited RL for LLM agents training: prohibitive cost, scarcity of diverse tasks, unstable reward signals, and heavy infrastructure demands. It reframes training around an environment purpose-built for RL, enabling efficient synthetic training and effective sim-to-real transfer, improving generalization while minimizing reliance on costly real-world interactions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate DreamGym across diverse environments and LLM agent backbones. For use cases lacking RL training support (e.g., WebArena (Zhou et al.)), DreamGym provides the only viable approach for RL-based agent training, delivering over 30% improvement over all baselines and SOTA methods. In settings where RL is supported but costly, DreamGym achieves performance on par with GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) and PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), while training entirely within DreamGym without external interactions. Moreover, we introduce DreamGym-S2R (sim-to-real), which first trains agents in DreamGym using diverse, curriculum-driven synthetic experiences before transferring them to external environments. This approach yields over 40% performance improvement compared to training from scratch in real-world environments while using less than 10% of the external data, providing scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL."

Classical\nRL algorithms such as policy gradients and actor–critic methods (Williams, 1992; Schulman et al., 2017)\nhave achieved strong results in robotics, games, and control (Silver et al., 2016).

Tasks such as web navigation (Yao et al., 2022; Zhou et al.), operating-system control (Xie et al., 2024b), and multi-tool orchestration (Yao et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024a) require long-horizon interaction yet provide sparse and delayed rewards (Qi et al., 2024), making policy improvement challenging and costly, and often result in training collapse. In addition, scaling RL for LLM agents is constrained by the lack of diverse, verifiable task suites, which typically require substantial human effort to design and annotate reward logic (Zhou et al., 2025). These challenges are further compounded by heterogeneous environment dynamics and engineering constraints in the real world. For example, open environments such as web pages are highly dynamic and produce noisy reward signals (Xue et al., 2025). Meanwhile, they often lack reliable reset mechanisms and introduce safety risks during large-scale exploration (Zhou et al.). Together, these challenges make real-environment RL impractical for general-purpose agents, motivating the need for scalable solution that can supply adaptive, high-quality interaction data."

            "content": "Synthetic data has long been used to address the scarcity of expert demonstrations (Zhang et al., 2025). Early approaches relied on scripting oracle trajectories or generating them from stronger teacher models, training agents primarily through imitation learning (Yao et al., 2022; Pahuja et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2023). While effective for distillation, these static trajectories require substantial human labeling and lack diversity and adaptivity. To reduce manual effort, subsequent work (Xu et al.; Ou et al., 2024) leveraged indirect sources of expertise (e.g., online tutorials) to guide trajectory synthesis, while another line of work, including AgentSynth (Xie et al., 2025) and SCA (Zhou et al., 2025), focuses on synthesizing diverse tasks to expand the space of RL exploration. However, these methods still depend on data collection in real environments, which inherently suffer from the scalability issue and are subject to the limitations outlined earlier. Later research shifted toward building synthetic environments, such as AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) and Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020; Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018), which interact with agents to generate unlimited on-policy experiences. More recently, WebDreamer (Gu et al., 2024) and WebEvolver (Fang et al., 2025) constructed world models to produce environment feedback for agent planning and training. Closest to our setting, UI-Simulator (Wang et al., 2025b) also leverages LLMs as step-wise simulator, but it requires substantial expert engineering to adapt to different environments and is limited to generating only trajectory variations for supervised fine-tuning of the policy. In contrast, DreamGym provides complete toolkit for general-purpose RL, supporting diverse task generation and consistent rollout synthesis with rich reward signals, offering the first scalable solution for training generic LLM agents in arbitrary environments."

Given set of seed tasks, reasoning-based experience model interacts with the agent to generate informative, diverse tasks and trajectories for RL training. At each step, the agent takes actions based on its current state and receives next states and reward signals derived by the experience model through CoT reasoning based on both interaction history and top-k similar experiences from an active replay buffer. To expose the agent to increasingly informative scenarios, tasks with high reward entropy are proposed by the curriculum task generator for future training. With this unified design, DreamGym addresses both task and reward sparsity while enabling scalable RL with diverse and curriculum-driven environments. textual environment descriptions.

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) is popular policy gradient method that improves stability by computing ˆA with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE): ˆAPPO = K1 (cid:88) l=0 (γλ)l [rt+l + γV (st+l+1) (st+l)] , (2) where () is value function approximated by LLM, and λ controls the bias-variance tradeoff. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) extends PPO by discarding the value function and normalizing advantages within each group of responses sampled for the same task instruction. Instead of GAE, the group-relative advantage is defined as: ˆAGRPO = (rt meaniG(ri))/stdiG(ri) (3) where rt is the reward for output ot, meaniG(ri) and stdiG(ri) are mean and standard deviation of rewards from group G. GRPO discards the value function and approximates the advantage using relative normalized rewards, making policy updates more scalable but potentially less sample-efficient.

            "content": "For effective RL training, instead of relying on heterogeneous external environments that are costly to interact with and difficult to control, DreamGym adopts more adaptive and controllable approach by building LLM-based experience model that can efficiently interact with the agent over multiple turns to generate diverse experiences with consistent outcomes and rich feedback signals for learning. Unlike prior data-hungry and costly approaches that build world models to replicate the real world in raw pixel spaces, we design an efficient reasoning experience model, denoted as Mexp, that operates in an abstract, meta-representational textual space S. The key insight is that synthesizing transitions in this abstract state space can reduce irrelevant dimensions and produce trajectories that are more informative and token-efficient than those derived from raw observations. For example, in web shopping task, instead of processing raw HTML code, the experience model directly synthesizes clean element listings while discarding irrelevant structural artifacts such as headers and tags. This state-space design makes training the experience model highly sample-efficient, requiring only small pubic trajectory datasets in our experiments, while also enhancing the effectiveness of agent learning. 4.1.1 Inference for Experience Rollout Collection Notably, we find that beyond the current state-action pair, three additional contexts are important for improving state quality: (1) interaction history {(si, ai)}T t=0, which incorporates the past trajectory in the context window to help maintain state consistency across multiple turns; (2) task instruction τ , which conditions the experience model on the current goal, enabling it to interpret actions w.r.t. task objectives and thereby predict both state transitions and rewards more accurately; (3) past experiences, which are top-k demonstrations {dj}k j=1 retrieved from the replay buffer based on semantic similarity with the stateaction pair, i.e., {dj}k j=1 = Topk(cos(ϕ(st, at), ϕ(si, ai))), where ϕ() denotes an arbitrary semantic encoder. Leveraging knowledge this way reduces hallucinations and improves factuality for knowledge-intensive state predictions. Therefore, given these inputs, the experience model predicts the next state st+1 and reward rt+1 via chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022): (cid:16) (st+1, rt+1) = Mexp Rt (cid:12) (cid:12){(si, ai)}t i=0, {dj}k j=1, τ (cid:17) . (4) where Rt is an explicit reasoning trace produced by the experience model that guides the state transition. With such reasoning, it predicts the most consistent and informative transition and feedback that reflects the consequence of the agent action. For example, if the action is invalid, it transitions to failure state and assigns zero reward to signal the error, and vice versa. In our experiments, following (Feng et al., 2025), we adopt an outcome-based reward scheme, assigning = 1 only at the final step when the task is successfully completed and = 0 in all other cases. 4.1.2 Training Experience Models to Reason Benefiting from the abstract state-space design, training the experience model is highly sample-efficient and requires only limited data from the real environment. In practice, abundant offline trajectory datasets from public benchmarks such as the WebArena Leaderboard are sufficient for training. Our experience model distills such offline knowledge and then serves as bridge to interact with the agent online for RL training. Concretely, given trajectory dataset = {(st, at, st+1, rt+1)}, each transition is annotated with an explicit reasoning trace by LLM (prompt shown in Appendix C.1), which explains why the action at taken in 5 state st consequently leads to the next state st+1 and reward rt+1 given the available contexts. To distill this knowledge, we train Mexp via SFT with joint objective over reasoning generation and next-state prediction: LSFT = E(st,at,st+1,R )D (cid:104) log Pθ(R st, at, Ht, Dk) log Pθ(st+1 st, at, (cid:105) , Ht, Dk) , (5) where Ht denotes the interaction history, Dk denotes the retrieved top-k demonstrations, and θ denotes the parameters of Mexp. This objective ensures that the model (i) learns to generate faithful reasoning traces that explain the causal effect of an action, and (ii) leverages these traces to predict consistent and informative next states. By doing so, the experience model not only imitates expert trajectories but also acquires the ability to generalize reasoning for novel rollouts during RL training."

            "title": "4.2 Curriculum-based Task Generation",
            "content": "Diverse, curriculum-aligned task instructions are important for RL agents to acquire knowledge (Zhou et al., 2025). However, scaling task collections is costly, as it requires significant human effort to verify the feasibility of each task in the target environment. DreamGym inherently alleviates this burden by adapting to arbitrary new tasks within the target domain through synthetic multi-turn transitions. Building on this capability, we propose curriculum-based task generation, where the same experience model actively generates new tasks as variations of set of seed tasks: τt = Mtask({τ t1}m i=1), (6) where Mtask shares parameters with Mexp. Specifically, the seed tasks are chosen based on two criteria: (1) they are sufficiently challenging for the current agent policy, thereby maximizing information gain; (2) they are well-defined, such that unrealistic or malformed tasks can be discarded. To satisfy both conditions, we introduce group-based reward entropy as criteria for selecting high-quality and challenging tasks. Formally, for task τ , we define its value Vτ = 1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:0)ri r(cid:1) , where = 1 (cid:88) i=1 ri, (7) where ri are the outcome rewards from rollouts of task τ within the group G. For GRPO, can simply be the training group, while for PPO, tasks can be first clustered using semantic embedder, and each cluster essentially forms group from which task variations can be generated. Notably, non-zero variance in indicates that the agent observes both successes and failures on the task, signaling that the task is feasible yet challenging. task reaches maximum entropy when successes and failures are evenly balanced in G, providing the greatest information gain for credit assignment. This observation is consistent with recent findings that LLMs learn most effectively from tasks of intermediate difficulty (Gao et al., 2025). Thus, by feeding such high-entropy tasks into Mtask, we generate progressively more challenging variations to enhance agent exploration and knowledge acquisition. To stabilize training, we introduce hyperparameter λ that bounds the proportion of synthetic tasks sampled per iteration. This preserves sufficient coverage of the original task distribution while directing exploration toward the current policys weakness regions for curriculum-based improvement."

These results demonstrate that\nDreamGym is not merely a surrogate for costly rollouts, but a mechanism that makes RL training feasible in\ndomains that were previously intractable due to inherent task and engineering constraints.",
            "content": "RL-ready environments. On WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) and ALFWorld (Shridhar et al.), DreamGymtrained agents perform on par with GRPO and PPO agents trained on 80K real interactions, despite using only synthetic rollouts. The ability to match strong RL baselines in RL-ready environments without external interactions underscores that DreamGym produces transitions and rewards that are not only coherent and meaningful, but also sufficient for stable policy improvement. Furthermore, when small-scale RL phase with an affordable number of real rollouts (5k) is applied to the policy mid-trained in the synthetic environment, DreamGym-S2R consistently outperforms both GRPO and PPO baselines trained from scratch in the real environments. This validates the hypothesis that synthetic training can serve as an efficient warm-start strategy that establishes strong foundation for more sample-efficient RL in the real environment. Sample efficiency and training cost. Training efficiency is further illustrated in Fig. 3 Left, where DreamGym achieves substantial performance gains on WebArena (Zhou et al.) while reducing training effort (including both rollouts sampling time and GPU hours) to roughly one-third or even one-fifth of RL baselines in the real environment. The efficiency gain arises from both the dense feedback offered by curriculum-based rollout synthesis and the lightweight abstract state transitions produced by unified experience models hosted by scalable LLM services, which substantially reduce sampling cost and avoid heterogeneous environment bottlenecks, suggesting that DreamGym is not only practical solution for RL training in complex and expensive environments, but also as scalable way to generate low-cost data for stable policy improvement. Generalization and learning transferability. The results in Fig. 3 Middle highlight the strong generalization and cross-domain transferability of the policy trained in DreamGym. Notably, (1) when trained on WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), the policy generalizes to WebArena (Zhou et al.) and surpasses SFT models directly trained there, and (2) when trained on WebArena, it similarly transfers back to WebShop with superior performance than the SFT as well. This generalization suggests that DreamGym learns within an abstract meta-representation space, enabling the agent to learn domain-agnostic behavioral priors rather than memorizing task-specific patterns. However, (3) when the domain gap becomes too large, such as transferring from web-based environments (WebShop/WebArena) to ALFWorld (Shridhar et al.), the performance drops significantly, indicating the limits of current meta-representations."

            "content": "Fig. 3 Right compares training curves across Webshop (Yao et al., 2022) under different setups. Specifically, the success rate improves much more rapidly within the first 40 steps, showing that synthesized trajectories offer more informative gradients than sparse real rollouts. This further highlights the role of synthetic experiences in shaping strong initialization that real rollouts cannot. Another observation is the reduced variance in learning dynamics. Baseline curves exhibit larger oscillations caused by sparse or unstable rewards, while DreamGym curves remain smoother across runs, which suggests that synthesized trajectories provide not only denser but also more consistent feedback, mitigating the training instabilities commonly reported in WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) and ALFWorld (Shridhar et al.)."

Similarly, Table 2 shows that removing the task generator leads to 6.6% and 6.0% drop in success rate compared with the full DreamGym configuration in WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) and WebArena (Zhou et al.), respectively. w/o Exp.

In contrast, the task generator continually produces progressively challenging, high-value tasks that push the agent beyond its current capability. This ongoing curriculum keeps the replay buffer informative and encourages exploration, ultimately yielding higher final success rates and better sample efficiency."

We evaluate each variant along four criteria: consistency, diversity, informativeness, and hallucination, using GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) as judge. As detailed in Appendix C.4, the judge assigns discrete scores in {0, 1, 2} for each criteria, where higher values indicate better performance. For the first three metrics, larger scores mean more consistent, diverse, and informative; for hallucination, score of 2 means no hallucination, while 0 indicates more factual errors. Figure 4 Evaluation of the experience model across key criteria using GPT-4o as the judge. We randomly sample 100 trajectories and prompt the model to assign discrete scores in {0, 1, 2} across four criteria, as detailed in Appendix C.4. The results highlight the role of each component. Removing trajectory history (w/o History) significantly reduces consistency: without awareness of prior turns, the model often drifts off-topic and breaks causal coherence in multi-step interactions. Removing reasoning (w/o Reasoning) mainly hurts informativeness of the states and increases hallucination: without reasoning capabilities, the generated experiences tend to become shallow and less factually grounded. Notably, removing experience reasoning also leads to substantial drop in overall performance, as shown in Table 2. In contrast, the full DreamGym achieves the best or near-best performance across all metrics, confirming that history and reasoning provide complementary benefits. More specifically, history preserves temporal and causal structure, while reasoning enhances depth and factual reliability. This validates that the experience model must operate in structured, reasoning-driven manner to maintain both diversity and fidelity of trajectories. 9 Figure 6 case study of trajectory sampled with DreamGym in WebArena.

            "content": "Fig. 5 investigates how the success rate of the experience model varies with both the amount of offline training data and the choice of model backbone, evaluated on (a) WebShop and (b) WebArena. We first observe that the experience model is highly data-efficient. Even with very limited number of offline samples (2k-10k), it already reaches competitive performance. On WebShop, for example, the Llama-3.1-8B exceeds 50% success rate with only 10k samples, indicating that large-scale offline datasets are not strictly necessary for effective experience synthesis. Next, we find that smaller backbones remain viable. Although Llama-3.2-3B underperforms the 8B model, it improves steadily as more data becomes available, reaching about 55% success on WebShop with 20k samples, which suggests that lightweight models can still serve as practical experience generators when computational resources are constrained. Finally, in the extreme low-data regime, pretrained world knowledge becomes particularly valuable. On WebArena, WebDreamer (Gu et al., 2024) (a fine-tuned web world model) achieves around 13% success, initially outperforming the Llama-3.1-8B model at smaller data scales but eventually converging as the number of offline samples increases. This suggests that while web-specific pretraining offers an early advantage, it is not strict prerequisite, as larger-scale experience learning can enable pre-trained models to bridge the performance gap.

            "title": "A Detailed Experiment Settings",
            "content": "In this section, we provide implementation details for each environment. A.1 WebShop WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) is large-scale agent benchmark designed to study language grounding in interactive environments. It simulates realistic e-commerce website with 1.18M real-world products and 12,087 crowd-sourced natural language instructions, where agents must search, customize, and purchase items. The environment poses challenges such as interpreting compositional product requirements, reformulating queries, handling noisy webpage text, and strategically exploring diverse page types. RL Baseline Setup. We follow the standard setup and hyperparameter settings from Verl-Agent (Feng et al., 2025) and perform full-parameter fine-tuning for all three agent backbones in our experiments. DreamGym Settings. To train the reasoning experience model, we construct dataset by combining 1,600 human demonstration trajectories from the official WebShop repository with an additional 2,000 trajectories collected using an oracle agent and random exploration. We fix the test set to ensure evaluation stability and collect training trajectories only from the remaining tasks to avoid test-set contamination. Each transition is further augmented with reasoning trace generated by strong teacher LLM, resulting in the dataset used for fine-tuning. Computation Resources. All experiments, including both baselines and ours, are conducted on 8 nodes with A100 GPUs and 4 nodes with H100 GPUs. A.2 ALFWorld ALFWorld (Shridhar et al.) is text-and-embodied benchmark with hand-crafted task instructions designed for studying language grounding and cross-modal transfer. It pairs abstract text interactions from TextWorld with photo-realistic, physics-based execution in ALFRED/AI2-THOR, spanning six household task families (e.g., Pick & Place, Clean & Place, Heat/Cool & Place) with 3,553 training tasks and seen/unseen splits across 120 rooms. Agents issue high-level textual actions (goto, open, take, clean/heat/cool, put) that must be realized as low-level visuomotor controllers, facing challenges such as partial observability, object search and manipulation, mapping language to action preconditions and affordances, and bridging the gap between abstract plans and physical feasibility. RL Baseline Setup. We adopt the standard setup and hyperparameter settings from Verl-Agent (Feng et al., 2025) and perform full-parameter fine-tuning for all three agent backbones. DreamGym Settings. We follow the default ALFWorld split (Shridhar et al.) with the TextWorld setup (Côté et al., 2018) under the Verl-Agent framework. From the training split, we extract 3,200 expert demonstration trajectories paired with task instructions, and additionally sample 2,000 offline trajectories using both oracle and random policies. These datasets form the basis for training the reasoning experience model. Each transition is further augmented with reasoning trace generated by powerful LLM, which is used for fine-tuning. Computation Resources. All experiments, including both baselines and ours, are conducted on 8 nodes with A100 GPUs and 4 nodes with H100 GPUs. A.3 WebArena WebArena (Zhou et al.) is self-hosted, realistic web environment for training and evaluating autonomous agents across fully functional sites such as e-commerce, social forums, collaborative software development (GitLab), and content management, which are augmented with tools (map, calculator, scratchpad) and knowledge bases (e.g., offline Wikipedia, manuals). It provides 812 long-horizon tasks expressed as high-level 15 natural language intents and evaluates agents by functional correctness rather than matching action traces, supporting multi-tab browsing and rich action space (click, type, navigate, tab operations). Training Set Split. Since the full evaluation set in WebArena is large and contains many similar tasks, we follow prior work (Qi et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025) and evaluate agents on WebArena-Lite (Liu et al., 2024), more balanced subset of 165 high-quality, challenging tasks selected from the original 812. The remaining 647 tasks, excluding those in the evaluation set, are used for training. RL Baseline Setup. Since no reliable open-source RL infrastructure exists for WebArena (Qi et al., 2024), we follow the standard workflow in Verl-Agent (Feng et al., 2025) and implement vanilla RL pipeline for WebArena. The baseline collects action trajectories via browsergym (Zhou et al.) while hosting the WebArena websites on AWS servers, supporting both PPO and GRPO. Despite extensive engineering effort, we are able to operate only four AWS servers, enabling at most four parallel interaction sessions, which in turn imposes significant bottleneck on training throughput. During RL sampling, we sequentially sweep through the task set and manually restart the servers and reset the environments once all tasks have been visited once, in order to avoid cross-task interference. Nevertheless, we observe that some trajectories fail to execute properly and that certain tasks are incorrectly judged by WebArenas original evaluation function, known issue also reported in prior work (Qi et al., 2024; Chae et al., 2025). For fairness, we retain all collected trajectories and use them as-is for RL training. DreamGym Settings. To obtain offline trajectories for training the reasoning experience model, we extract successful demonstrations from the highest-performing agents on the public WebArena leaderboard. Specifically, we use agents that incorporate accessibility tree information in their observations, including IBM CUGA (Marreed et al., 2025), ScribeAgent (Shen et al., 2024), Learn-by-Interact (Su et al., 2025), and AgentOccam (Yang et al., 2024). To mitigate distribution imbalance, we additionally collect trajectories generated by high-performing agent and by random policy. In total, we obtain 4,800 offline trajectories for training. Each transition is then augmented with reasoning trace generated by powerful LLM, forming the dataset for fine-tuning the reasoning experience model. Computation Resources. All experiments, including both baselines and ours, are conducted on 8 nodes with A100 GPUs and 4 nodes with H100 GPUs."

B.1 Provably Policy Improvement in Real Environments Trained with Synthetic Experiences DreamGym trains LLM agents using reasoning-based experience model Mexp, which interacts with the agent and induces synthetic MDP (cid:99)M. For brevity, we use (cid:99)M to denote any such synthetic environment, including Mexp, which is defined in the abstract textual state space, as stated in 4.1. The learned policy is then evaluated in the real environment M, projected into the same abstract space for comparison. We show that, under standard trust-region policy update assumptions, policy optimized in (cid:99)M is guaranteed to also achieve policy improvement in the real environment M. Theorem 1 (Policy Improvement in Real Environment via Synthetic Experiences). Let the real MDP be = (S, A, P, R, γ), the synthetic MDP induced by Mexp be (cid:99)M = (S, A, (cid:98)P , (cid:98)R, γ), discount be γ (0, 1), and let rewards be bounded R, (cid:98)R [0, Rmax] with Vmax := Rmax/(1 γ). Assume one-step experience-model errors εR := sup s,a (cid:12)R(s, a) (cid:98)R(s, a)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12), εP := sup s,a TV(cid:0)P (s, a), (cid:98)P (s, a)(cid:1), (8) and trust-region update π π obtained by optimizing in (cid:99)M with per-state KL radius sups KL(π(s) π(s)) δ, as enforced by the soft KL penalty in PPO and GRPO. Hence JM(π) JM(π) 1 1 γ (cid:124) Esdπ (cid:99)M , aπ(s) (cid:2)Aπ (cid:99)M (s, a)(cid:3) (cid:123)(cid:122) synthetic surrogate gain in Mexp (cid:125) 4γ (1 γ)2 Vmax δ (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:124) trust-region penalty 2 + (cid:18) εR 1 γ 2γRmax (1 γ)2 εP (cid:123)(cid:122) experience model error (cid:124) (9) (cid:19) (cid:125) In particular, if the synthetic surrogate gain exceeds the two penalties, then JM(π) JM(π). Specifically, (1) the synthetic surrogate gain denotes the agents performance improvement when trained and evaluated within the synthetic environment provided by the experience model Mexp. (2) The trust-region penalty corresponds to the KL radius δ constraint, which is softly enforced by PPO or GRPO. (3) The experience-model error measures how well Mexp preserves learning-relevant signals of the original environment for agent knowledge acquisition including two key components: (a) the faithfulness of feedback (εR), i.e., how accurately reward signals reflect real outcomes, and (b) the domain consistency of state transitions (εP ), i.e., how well state space distributions align with the dynamics from the original environment. Notably, these two error terms align with our design insights in 4.1: the synthetic environment need only provide domain-consistent transitions and correct, retrospective learning signals, without having to clone the original environment at the raw state level. In practice, both εR and εP can be made very small even when Mexp is trained with minimal trajectory data annotated with explicit reasoning traces. Proof of Theorem 1. We first decompose the policy improvement in the real environment through the synthetic environment: By Lemma 1, each of the two policy discrepancy terms (cid:12) JM(π) JM(π) = (cid:0)J (cid:99)M(π) (cid:99)M(π)(cid:1) + (cid:0)JM(π) (cid:12)JM() (cid:99)M(π)(cid:1). (cid:12) is at most model, hence (cid:99)M(π)(cid:1) (cid:0)JM(π) (cid:99)M()(cid:12) (cid:99)M(π)(cid:1) 2model. JM(π) JM(π) (cid:0)J (cid:99)M(π) It remains to lower bound improvement inside the synthetic environment. Using the standard trust-region bound (Schulman et al., 2015), which is enforced in practice by PPO and GRPO via per-state KL radius δ, we have (1 γ)2 Vmax δ. Combining these two terms yields the inequality in Theorem 1, which completes the proof. (cid:99)M(π) , aπ(s) (cid:99)M (cid:99)M(π) Esdπ (cid:2)Aπ (cid:99)M (s, a)(cid:3) 1 1 γ 4γ (10) (11) (12) 17 Lemma 1 (Multi-turn experience synthesis error bound). For any policy π, if εR = sup s,a R(s, a) (cid:98)R(s, a), εP = sup s,a TV(cid:0)P (s, a), (cid:98)P (s, a)(cid:1), then (cid:12) (cid:12)JM(π) (cid:99)M(π)(cid:12) (cid:12) model := εR 1 γ + 2γRmax (1 γ)2 εP . (13) (14) Proof. We first compare the Bellman operators of the real and synthetic environments. For any bounded value function , (TπV )(s) = Eaπ(s) (cid:2)R(s, a) + γ EsP (s,a)V (s)(cid:3), and let (cid:98)Tπ be the same expression with (R, ) replaced by ( (cid:98)R, (cid:98)P ). Thus for any bounded value function , the operator difference is bounded as TπV (cid:98)TπV sup s,a R(s, a) (cid:98)R(s, a) + γ sup s,a (cid:12) EsP (s,a)V (s) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:98)P (s,a)V (s) (cid:12) (cid:12) εR + 2γV εP , which is derived by simply using the definitions of εR, εP and the variational characterization of TV. Now apply this bound to = π and addsubtract: π π (cid:99)M (cid:98)TπV π = TπV π (cid:99)M + (cid:98)TπV π TπV π (cid:98)TπV π π εR + 2γVmaxεP + γV π (cid:99)M (cid:98)TπV π (cid:99)M . By rearranging the contraction term into the left side, we have Hence (1 γ)V π π (cid:99)M εR + 2γVmaxεP . π π (cid:99)M 1 1γ (cid:0)εR + 2γVmaxεP (cid:1). Finally, since JE (π) = Es0µ[V π (s0)], we obtain (cid:99)M(π)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)JM(π) (cid:12) = (s0)(cid:3)(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:2)V π M(s0) π (cid:99)M Es0µ (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) π π (cid:99)M εR 2γRmax (1 γ)2 εP 1 γ =: model. + (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) This indicates that the gap of agent performance between real and synthetic environments depends only on reward accuracy and domain consistency errors, rather than on strict fidelity metrics such as state reconstruction error, etc."
