Recent developments, such as the New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI (NPR, 2025) over unauthorized data usage, have further highlighted these challenges.

Figure 1: The Probability Seesaw Effect: Reverse optimization methods (GA/NPO) indiscriminately suppress target token probabilities, while ReLearn reconstructs knowledge space via positive optimization. to develop techniques capable of removing unauthorized knowledge from the parameters of large language models (LLMs). Given the prohibitive computational cost of retraining from scratch, LLM unlearning serves as practical alternative. However, existing unlearning methods, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) (Jang et al., 2023) and Negative Preference Optimization (NPO) (Zhang et al., 2024a), raise significant challenge: they often degrade the fundamental language generation capabilities of models, producing repetitive or incoherent outputs that resemble the linguistic impairments observed in Alzheimers patients (Fraser et al., 2016). As illustrated in Figure 1, the core issue with GA and NPO stems from the probability seesaw effect caused by reverse optimization. This indiscriminate suppression of target token probabilities results in linguistically degraded text generation, which manifests in two ways: (1) vocabulary collapse (reduced fluency) and (2) contextual incoherence (diminished relevance). Additionally, current evaluation metrics for unlearning focus narrowly on specific contextual forgetting, failing to capture these broader limitations in fluency and relevance. To address these issues, we introduce ReLearn, novel unlearning pipeline that leverages data augmentation and positive optimization. ReLearn overwrites sensitive information with new authorized knowledge by training the model on augmented data. This preserves the models linguistic ability while forgetting target knowledge, akin to human memory updating (Lee et al., 2017). Additionally, we introduce comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three metrics: Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR), Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR), and Linguistic Score (LS). These metrics respectively evaluate knowledge forgetting, retention, and linguistic quality, providing more holistic evaluation of unlearning performance. Our experiments demonstrate that reverse optimization methods (GA and NPO) struggle to balance knowledge forgetting and retention, often producing repetitive and incoherent text. Furthermore, they are unstable under varying parameter precision and jailbreak attacks. In contrast, ReLearn effectively balances forgetting and retention while ensuring robustness against precision variations and jailbreak attacks. The ReLearn model retains general understanding of forgotten questions, enabling it to generate relevant, fluent, and privacy-preserving responses. Finally, we provide mechanistic analysis, revealing how reverse optimization methods disrupt the models ability to generate coherent outputs, while ReLearn preserves this capability. In summary, our main contributions are: Paradigm Innovation: We introduce ReLearn, novel unlearning paradigm based on positive optimization. Evaluative Framework: We propose comprehensive set of unlearning evaluation metrics to address the limitations in current ROUGE-based and PPL-based metrics. Mechanistic Insights: Our analysis reveals the disruptive impact of reverse optimization and highlights the plasticity of ReLearn."

            "content": "2.1 Problem Definition We define LLM unlearning as follows: given vanilla model trained on dataset that consists of forget set Df and retain set Dr. For all (xf , yf ) Df and (xr, yr) Dr, the unlearning goal is to transform into an unlearned model Munl, with the following goals: Forgets the content in Df , i.e., Munl(xf ) = yf . Retains the content in Dr, i.e., Munl(xr) = yr. Preserves its performance on generic tasks and linguistic coherence. Figure 2: Limitations of Existing Metrics: ROUGE-L is susceptible to output length due to treating all tokens equally. PPLs average token probability can mask quality issues with partial high probability tokens. Ideally, Munl should behave identically to model Mret (the retrained model) trained only on Df (the dataset excluding the data Df ). However, due to the high computational cost of retraining LLMs from scratch, the focus shifts to Approximate Unlearning (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023), where Munl approximates the behavior of Mret without strict equality. 2.2 Rethinking Unlearning Existing unlearning methods, such as GA and NPO, rely on reverse optimization, which often leads to unpredictable outputs. Furthermore, traditional evaluation metrics for unlearning, such as ROUGEL Recall and Perplexity (PPL), exhibit significant limitations. ROUGE-L treats all tokens equally, making it sensitive to output length and superficial wording changes, as evidenced by the NPO example in Figure 2. Similarly, PPL, which measures average token probabilities, can be misleadingly low even for poor-quality outputs, as evidenced by the repetitive sequences generated by GA in Figure 2. These shortcomings reveal that current metrics fall short of capturing the overall performance of unlearned models, especially in terms of relevance and fluency. In practice, effective unlearning should result in model that behaves as if it were never exposed to the knowledge to be forgotten. As illustrated in Figure 2, when queried about forgotten knowledge (e.g., How can fans contact Priya Gupta?), well-unlearned model should produce relevant but privacy-free responses (e.g., Fans can reach out through conventional electronic communication channels.), rather than nonsensical outputs (e.g., at at.) or sensitive responses (e.g., priya.gupta@delhimail.in). In conclusion, robust response after unlearning should satisfy three critical criteria: (a) Forgetting, (b) Relevance, and (c) Fluency. 2.3 Unlearning Evaluation Metrics To address the limitations of existing unlearning metrics, we propose comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three novel metrics: Knowledge Forgetting Ratio (KFR), Knowledge Retention Ratio (KRR), and Linguistic Score (LS). KFR and KRR measure the extent of knowledge forgetting and retention, respectively. These metrics are computed using the Entity Coverage Score (ECS) and the Entailment Score (ES), as detailed in the Appendix A.1. ECS assesses the presence of critical entities in the models outputs, and ES measures whether the output implies the target knowledge using Natural Language Inference (NLI) (Min et al., 2023). KFR and KRR are formulated as follows: (cid:16) (cid:88) (Ei < c1) KFR = 1 (cid:0)MNLI(T KRR = 1 (cid:0)MNLI(T i=1 ref, i=1 gen, (cid:88) ref) = contradiction(cid:1)(cid:17) (cid:16) (Ei > c2) gen) = contradiction(cid:1)(cid:17) (1) (2) where, for each instance in the evaluation dataset D, KFR assesses forgetting either when the ECS (Ei) is below threshold c1, or when NLI model MNLI detects contradiction between generated text gen and reference text ref. Conversely, KRR evaluates retention when Ei > c2 and no contradiction is ref and detected between gen. LS evaluates the linguistic quality of the unlearned model, inspired by cognitive linguistic research on Alzheimers patients (Fraser et al., 2016; Heitz et al., 2024). This metric captures linguistic degradation patterns, such as reduced vocabulary diversity, simplified syntax, and diminished lexical richness. LS is computed as the harmonic mean of three complementary measures: PPL as baseline, along with Brunets Index (BI) (Brunet, 1978) and Honores Statistic (HS) (Honoré, 1979), which offer more nuanced cognitive assessments, including vocabulary diversity and lexical richness. The formulation is as follows: LS = HM(cid:0)σ( log(PPL)), σ( log(BI)), σ(log(HS))(cid:1) (3) where σ is the sigmoid function and HM is the harmonic mean. BI and HS are calculated as follows: (cid:88) BI = 1 i=1 0.165 (4) HS = 1 (cid:88) i=1 100 log Ni 1 1 /Vi (5) where, for each instance in the evaluation dataset D, Ni is the word count, 1 is the number of words appearing only once, and Vi is the total vocabulary size of the text. Lower BI values indicate greater vocabulary diversity, while higher HS values signify increased lexical richness. These metrics were selected for their demonstrated sensitivity to linguistic deterioration. Finally, we employ GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024) to assess Fluency of the output, validating the rationality of our proposed Linguistic Score; and to evaluate Relevance, measuring the models ability to generate contextually appropriate responses while avoiding hallucinations or collapses."

            "content": "We elaborate ReLearn in this section, which is illustrated in Figure 3. ReLearn achieves effective unlearning through data augmentation and finetuning. This strategy replaces sensitive content with new, non-sensitive knowledge, guided by two key principles: (1) ensuring the successful forgetting of key content, and (2) generating relevant and coherent responses. Unlearning Data Synthesis. The first step of ReLearn is to synthesize non-sensitive training data. This is achieved by augmenting the forget set Df with diverse variations, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the knowledge to be forgotten. Data synthesis is entirely performed by an LLM using specific prompts, with details provided in Appendix C. This process involves two key steps: Question Augmentation: For each questionanswer pair (q, a) Df , we synthesize four types of question variations: (1) Simple Variant: Prevent overfitting to specific phrasings by varying the question language (e.g., What is Can you tell me). (2) Contextual Variant: Ensuring forgetting across contexts by adding situational context (e.g., in ... setting). (3) Noise Variant: Enhance (4) Logical Variant: robustness to noisy inputs. Figure 3: Illustration of ReLearn: High-quality data synthesis for effective unlearning. Adapting to different knowledge forms by altering the logic of the questions (e.g., What is your email? What are the different parts of your email address?). The augmented questions q, along with their corresponding original answers a, form the set DQ = {(q, a)}. Answer Augmentation: For each (q, a) DQ , we synthesize new pairs (q, a) with relevant, deliberately vague answers (a). Critically, must be: (1) Unlearned, containing no original sensitive content; (2) Relevant, aligning with the question context; and (3) No-risk, avoiding introducing new sensitive content. All such pairs form the augmented forget QA set DQA = {(q, a)}. This ensures that the model can respond appropriately without retaining the original sensitive details. Detailed examples of augmented QA pairs are provided in Appendix B.3. Content Verification. Synthesized data may introduce new privacy risk. To ensure the safety of the augmented data, we employ Content Verification process for the answers in DQA . This process utilizes LLMs to conduct Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2023b) analysis on each augmented answer, evaluating it against predefined safety criteria. Detailed prompts for the verification are provided in Appendix C.4. If verification fails, indicating potential risk in the augmented data, the process returns to the step of Answer Augmentation. (1) Sentence Completion: Data Diversification. To prevent QA format overfitting, we augment data with sentence completion pairs ( DSC ), split from each answer in DQA . For example, splitting Isabella Marquez can be reached through convenf tional electronic communication channels. into the text Isabella Marquez can be reached through and the label conventional electronic communication channels.. Then, we obtain Df = DQA DSC . (2) Generic Dataset: To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we incorporate generic data. We randomly sample questions from WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) and Chatbot Instruction (Kim et al., 2022) to form generic dataset ( Dg). For TOFU (Maini et al., 2024) and KnowUnDo (Tian et al., 2024), Dg is mixed with the augmented forget set ( Df ) in the ratio of 1:1 . Unlearning via Learning. We formulate the unlearning objective using three datasets: the augmented forget set Df , the retain set Dr, and the generic dataset Dg. For datasets Df Dg and Dr, we employ cross-entropy loss: LGDF = (x,y) Df Dg [ log Pθ(yx)] (6) LGDR = E(x,y)Dr [ log Pθ(yx)] To preserve knowledge in the retain set, we minimize Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL) between vanilla model and current model: (7) LKLR = ExDr [DKL(Pθ(x)Pθ0(x))] (8) where Pθ0 denotes the vanilla model distribution. Finally, the overall loss of ReLearn is: LReLearn = LGDF + LGDR + LKLR (9)"

(2) KnowUnDo (Tian et al., 2024), generated by GPT-4 to simulate real-world scenarios with QA pairs on sensitive content. We use the forget10 subset for TOFU and the privacy subset for KnowUnDo. TOFU evaluates performance on the training set, while KnowUnDo evaluates generalization on separate validation set. Notably, ReLearn trains only on augmented variants, so the reported results inherently offer an evaluation of unlearning generalization. 4.2 Baselines and Metrics To evaluate the forgetting performance of ReLearn, we compare it against three gradient-based baselines from prior LLM unlearning methods, focusing on their forgetting loss: (1) Gradient Ascent (GA) (Jang et al., 2023), which employs gradient ascent on the knowledge to be forgotten; (2) Negative Preference Optimization (NPO) (Zhang et al., 2024a), which leverages preference optimization only for the knowledge to be forgotten; and (3) Saliency-Based Unlearning with Large Learning Rate (SURE) (Zhang et al., 2024b), which dynamically identifies and updates the most relevant parameters for forgetting in each training step. We exclude representation-based unlearning methods due to their difficulty in balancing forgetting and retention (Shi et al., 2024). For retention loss, we employ Gradient Descent on Retain Set (GDR) and KL Divergence Minimization on Retain Set (KLR) to improve knowledge preservation. Detailed formulas are provided in the Appendix A.2. As described in 2.2, our evaluation uses KFR and KRR to measure knowledge unlearning and retention; and LS to evaluate response quality. The constants c1 in Eq (1) and c2 in Eq (2) are set to 0.3 for these metrics. All scores are averaged across the samples. To assess fluency (Flu.) and relevance (Rel.), we employ GPT Score (Sottana et al., 2023), generated by GPT-4o, ranging from 1 to 5. The prompt templates are shown in the appendix C.7. Detailed design principles for all metrics are provided in Appendix A.1. 4.3 Settings We utilize Deepseek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) for data augmentation and fine-tune the Llama27b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) and gemma-2-2bit (Team et al., 2024) models using LoRA (Hu et al., 2021). For KnowUnDo, it takes nearly 1,149,855 input tokens, 310,353 output tokens, and 240 minutes for data synthesis and training. All analysis experiments in this paper employ the regularized GA and NPO variants, i.e., GAGDR+SURE as GA and NPOGDR+SURE as NPO. Additional implementation details are provided in the Appendix A.3. 4.4 Results Main Results. We report the unlearning performance of Llama-2-7b-chat on KnowUnDo in Table 1 and TOFU in Table 2; additional results for gemma-2-2b-it can be found in Table 8 in the Appendix. Across these datasets, ReLearn achieves competitive KFR of 0.85 on both KnowUnDo and TOFU while maintaining high KRR (0.74 on KnowUnDo and 0.89 on TOFU). In contrast, the best baseline, NPOGDR, obtains KFR values of 0.98 on KnowUnDo and 0.95 on TOFU but much lower KRR (0.40 and 0.47, respectively).

In contrast, ReLearn preserves good LS (0.120.17 on KnowUnDo and 0.090.10 on TOFU) while maintaining Fluency and Relevance comparable to the vanilla model. These results show that ReLearn effectively balances forgetting and retention while preserving linguistic quality. In contrast, GA and NPO achieve extremely high KFR but suffer from poor retention performance. This trend persists in different datasets and models. Detailed cases are provided in Table 9, and supplementary studies in Appendix A.4 further demonstrate the balanced performance and adaptability of ReLearn. Human Evaluation & General Task Test. To further verify the unlearning performance and linguistic quality, we implement human evaluation to assess responses on Forgetting (Forget.), Relevance (Rel.), and Fluency (Flu.) using discrete rating scale of 1 to 5, as elaborated in Appendix C.1. The model names are anonymized and the scores are averaged among three volunteers. As shown in Table 3, ReLearn achieves score of 4.30 for Forgetting, effectively forgetting sensitive knowledge, while other models obtain low relevance and fluency scores, as they often produce repetitive and meaningless responses. Moreover, ReLearn performs best on two generic tasks (MMLU and GSM8K)."

Figure 4: Robustness Evaluation compares the KFR of three methods under precision changes (float16 bfloat16) and jailbreak attacks. under these conditions on KnowUnDo. The results are presented in Figure 4, and we can summarize two key findings. ReLearn Prevents Knowledge Leakage under Precision Variation. As seen from Figure 4, we observe that reducing the precision of the parameter from float16 to bfloat16 causes significant decrease in KFR performance, 9.7% for GA and 18.2% for NPO. This suggests that GA and NPO are sensitive to parameter precision and rely on fine-grained adjustments during LoRA fine-tuning. The sentence completion examples in Appendix Table 10 demonstrate that while GA and NPO exhibit unreadable outputs in most cases, indicating over-forgetting, they also reveal some instances of knowledge leakage. In contrast, ReLearn shows slight performance improvement of 1.4% under reduced precision while consistently maintaining coherent output. ReLearn Effectively Resists Jailbreaks. By using the AIM jailbreak attack (Wei et al., 2023a), prompt engineering method that forces compromised model responses (with templates in Appendix C.6), we observe KFR performance degradation of 5.0% for GA and 9.1% for NPO. In particular, ReLearn achieves performance improvement of 6.9%. This difference indicates that GA and NPO weaken the base models inherent jailbreak resistance, while ReLearn maintains and even enhances this defensive capability. As seen from the examples shown in Table 10, when attacked, ReLearn effectively prevents jailbreak attacks targeting forgotten knowledge, while GA and NPO tend to leak private information (sometimes incomplete) or generate unreadable responses. 5.2 The Mechanism of Unlearning In this section, we analyze how GA and NPO disrupt the models linguistic ability and explore how ReLearn reconstructs it. We analyze from three perspectives: Knowledge Distribution, Knowledge Memory, and Knowledge Circuits. 5.2.1 Knowledge Distribution GA and NPO both rely on reverse optimization to suppress the probabilities of the target token, leading to disruptive probability seesaw effect. To explore the knowledge distribution of different unlearning models, we calculate the top-5 candidate tokens in their outputs, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 9 in the Appendix. As observed, in models with multi-peaked probability distribution (e.g., Llama2 Vanilla in Figure 5), the seesaw effect exhibits two sequent steps: (1) Initial Target Token Suppression: By suppressing the initially top1 token and guiding the model towards other highprobability tokens, this potentially leads to sensitive responses (as illustrated in Figure 5, where the top-2 token in the Vanilla model becomes the top1 token in the NPO model). (2) Subsequent Top Token Suppression: This involves the continued suppression of high-probability tokens, resulting in probability redistribution across random tokens (as observed on Llama2 GA in Figure 5). In contrast, for models with unimodal probability distribution (e.g., Gemma in Figure 9), reverse optimization merely suppresses the single high-probability peak of the target token, resulting in more uniform probability distribution across random tokens after unlearning. The disrupted probability distributions resemble cognitive conflict (Xu et al., 2024b), which arises from the conflict between the intrinsic knowledge of model and external inputs or training objectives. Reverse optimization directly drives the decoding space toward randomness, leading to significant cognitive mismatch between the pre-unlearning and post-unlearning states, limiting question understanding and coherent generation. In contrast, ReLearn does not aim for complete disruption of the knowledge distribution. By learning to generate relevant yet non-sensitive answers, ReLearn guides the model toward new cognitive pattern. Figure 5: The top-5 candidate tokens distribution of different unlearning approaches on KnowUnDo. 5.2.2 Knowledge Memory Inspired by recent research (Geva et al., 2022, 2023; Ghandeharioun et al., 2024; Menta et al., 2025) that the early layers process context, the deeper layers memorize, and the last few layers handle the prediction of the next token, our analysis focuses on the final token positions outputs across all decoding layers(Belrose et al., 2023). Figure 6 demonstrates the difference between these methods. When queried with Carlos Riveras mailing address is..., the vanilla model directly activates both general concepts like address and location, as well as the answer terms such as Colomb. In contrast, ReLearn preserves semantic understanding without directly recalling the answer. In its middle and later layers, it recalls related concepts like located and address, along with query terms such as Carlos. In comparison, reverse optimization methods like NPO activate address before the 20th layer but fail to trigger threshold increases to 0.08, the circuits of vanilla model and ReLearn model become empty, while GA and NPO strengthen partial circuits, particularly those specific question patterns (e.g., How does...background...?). This observation suggests that GA and NPO over-forget specific question patterns, while ReLearn achieves generalized unlearning by weakening entity associations."

            "content": "Unlearning Methods for LLMs. LLM unlearning has recently gained significant attention. Gradient Ascent (Jang et al., 2023) maximizes loss for forgetting, while Negative Preference Optimization (Zhang et al., 2024a) draws on Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023). Various unlearning methods have been proposed (Lu et al., 2022; Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 2023; Pawelczyk et al., 2024; Gandikota et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Seyitoglu et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2024; Baluta et al., 2024; Zhuang et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025). Another strategy, locate-then-unlearn, includes Memflex (Tian et al., 2024) and SURE (Zhang et al., 2024b). Several data-based methods have also been introduced (Jang et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024a; Gu et al., 2024; Sinha et al., 2024). Furthermore, some papers have highlighted the limitations of current machine unlearning (Xu et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2024; Thaker et al., 2024; Cooper et al., 2024; Barez et al., 2025). Unlearning Evaluation for LLMs. Most studies (Maini et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024) utilize ROUGE and PPL for evaluating unlearning. Building upon these metrics, Joshi et al. (2024) measure unlearning via benchmark data transformation; WMDP (Li et al., 2024) further probes all layers to verify unlearning; MUSE (Shi et al., 2024) extends evaluation by using Member Inference Attack (Kim et al., 2024); RWKU (Jin et al., 2024) introduces concept-level unlearning benchmark with adversarial attacks. Similarly, Unstar (Sinha et al., 2024) uses GPT scores, and Ma et al. (2024b) introduces vision unlearning benchmark."

            "title": "7 Conclusion",
            "content": "This paper introduces ReLearn, novel unlearning framework via positive optimization that balances forgetting, retention, and linguistic capabilities. Our key contributions encompass practical unlearning paradigm, comprehensive metrics Figure 6: Knowledge Memory. Vanilla model generates 5000 Sierra Rd Bogota Colomb; GA/NPO produce repetitive at; ReLearn generates contextually relevant but non-sensitive response. related knowledge afterward, instead repeating at beyond the 20th layer. Moreover, the Forward-KL, which represents the KL Divergence between the current and final layers, shows gradual shift for the vanilla and ReLearn models, but severe shift for GA/NPO. This severe change hinders the effective use of semantic information for knowledge retrieval and refinement, impeding the appropriate generation of responses. In summary, reverse optimization significantly impairs knowledge memory by overemphasizing next-token prediction and disrupting the ability of gradual information adjustment, which is similar to memory loss in Alzheimers disease (Jahn, 2013). In contrast, ReLearn maintains robust knowledge memory across layers, preserving linguistic capabilities, and enabling fluent, relevant responses through positive optimization. 5.2.3 Knowledge Circuits We employ the LLMTT tool (Tufanov et al., 2024) to visualize knowledge circuits and investigate how different unlearning methods affect model focus. LLMTT identifies the salient connections (circuits) within the LLM inference process by varying the threshold, where higher thresholds indicate stronger connections. As shown in Figure 11 in the Appendix, with threshold of 0.06, the vanilla, GA, and NPO models exhibit similar circuit patterns. However, ReLearn notably reduces circuits associated with sensitive entities, indicating weakened focus on sensitive information. When the (KFR, KRR, LS), and mechanistic analysis comparing reverse and positive optimization."

            "content": "A.1 Metrics Details: ROUGE-L Recall It measures the recall of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between reference and generated texts. PPL (Perplexity) It measures the confidence of the model in generating text by calculating the average probability of output tokens. Lower PPL values indicate higher confidence, which often correlates with more fluent output. Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) & Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR): Both metrics are composed of Entity Coverage Score (ECS) and Entailment Score (ES), detailed below. For these metrics, the constants c1 and c2 in Eq (1) and Eq (2) are set to 0.3. This small c1 in KFR ensures that due to the dominance of ECS in the OR condition of Eq. (1), forgetting is reliably evaluated even when ES does not indicate contradiction. In contrast, this small c2 in KRR ensures baseline of partial entity retention, while semantic consistency is primarily validated by ES, which dominates in the AND condition of Eq (2). Entity Coverage Score (ECS) The Entity Coverage Score quantifies the coverage of key entities between reference and generated texts using the following formula: Ei = Entities(ai) Entities(bi) Entities(ai) (10) where Ei is the entity coverage score, and Entities(ai) and Entities(bi) are the entity sets extracted from the reference and generated texts, respectively. The final score is the average of all scores from the evaluation samples. Instead of treating all words equally like ROUGE-L, we aim to focus on key information, extracting key entities using deepseek-v3 with the prompt detailed in the Appendix C.5. In addition, since the same entity may appear in slightly different forms, we encode the extracted entities using sentence-transformer (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) and calculate their semantic consistency via cosine similarity. Entailment Score (ES) The Entailment score quantifies the proportion of output-reference pairs that natural language inference (NLI) model identifies as having an Entailment relationship. We use the deberta-v3-base-tasksource-nli model (Sileo, 2023) for this purpose. Following Yuan et al. (2024), when evaluating forgetting, we treat the model output as the premise and the reference answer as the hypothesis; when evaluating retention, we reverse this. The final score is the average of all evaluation samples scores, with higher scores indicating greater consistency. Linguistic Score (LS) This composite score integrates Perplexity (PPL), Brunets Index (BI), and Honores Statistic (HS). To address challenges in combining these metrics, we apply series of transformations. First, we take the logarithm of each metric to account for wide value ranges. Second, we normalize the metrics using two-step process: negating metrics where smaller is better (PPL, BI), then applying the sigmoid function to map all metrics to range between 0 and 1, where larger values indicate better responses. This approach, using both logarithm and sigmoid transformations, focuses on capturing significant differences in language capability, reducing sensitivity to minor variations within the same magnitude. A.2 Baselines Details: This section presents three gradient-based baselines for LLM unlearning: Gradient Ascent (GA) GA performs unlearning by maximizing the loss on forget set samples: LGA = E(x,y)Df [L(M (x; θ), y)] (11) where is the cross-entropy loss, (x; θ) is the model output with parameters θ, and Df denotes the forget set. Negative Preference Optimization (NPO) NPO (Zhang et al., 2024a) seeks to minimize the probability of the model generating target outputs for lr Method 5e-6 GAGDR GAGDR+SURE 5e-6 3e-4 GAKLR 1e-5 GAKLR+SURE NPOGDR 1e-5 NPOGDR+SURE 5e-6 NPOKLR 5e-6 NPOKLR+SURE 1e-5 ReLearn 1e-5 epochs bs accum. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 Table 4: Hyperparameter settings for Llama-2-7b-Chat on KnowUnDo Privacy. forget set samples: LNPO = 2 β EDf (cid:20) (cid:18) log σ β log (cid:19)(cid:21) πθ(yx) πref (yx) (12) where β is hyperparameter, πθ(yx) denotes the models predicted probability, πref (yx) is reference models probability. Saliency-Based Unlearning with Large Learning Rate (SURE) SURE(Zhang et al., 2024b) selectively updates model weights based on saliency scores, si, calculated as: (cid:13) (cid:13)θiLforget(θ; Dforget)(cid:12) (cid:13) where θi are module is weights, θo is the initial parameter, and is the Frobenius norm. (cid:12)θ=θo (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) , si = module mask, mM , is derived via hard thresholding γ: mM [i] = (cid:40) if si γ, 1, 0, otherwise, Unlearning updates only salient modules: θu = θo + mM θ, where θ is the update and is element-wise multiplication. This prevents knowledge recovery after quantization while maintaining utility. A.3 Implementation Details Experiments were conducted on single A100 GPU with 40GB of memory, using the Adam optimizer. The hyperparameter settings are detailed in Tables 4, 5, and 6. For TOFU, we utilize the pretrained Llama-2-7b-chat model released by the TOFU team as the vanilla model. For KnowUnDo Privacy, we train the Llama-2-7b-chat and Gemma2-2b-it models on the training and validation sets, lr Method 1e-4 GAGDR GAGDR+SURE 1e-4 1e-4 GAKLR 1e-4 GAKLR+SURE NPOGDR 3e-4 NPOGDR+SURE 3e-4 NPOKLR 1e-4 NPOKLR+SURE 1e-4 ReLearn 1e-5 epochs bs accum. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 Table 5: Hyperparameter settings for Llama-2-7b-Chat on TOFU forget10. lr Method 1e-5 GAGDR 1e-5 GAGDR+SURE GAKLR 1e-5 1e-5 GAKLR+SURE NPOGDR 3e-4 NPOGDR+SURE 3e-4 NPOKLR 3e-4 NPOKLR+SURE 3e-4 1e-5 ReLearn epochs bs accum. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 Table 6: Hyperparameter settings for gemma-2-2b-it on KnowUnDo Privacy. with learning rate of 3e-4, batch size of 16, gradient accumulation steps of 4, and 10 epochs. All experiments employ LoRA with the configuration {r=8, alpha=16, dropout=0.1}. Baseline learning rates are tuned over {5e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4, 3e-4}, with the best balance of KFR, KRR, and LS being reported. For inference during evaluation, we set the temperature to 0.7, top-p to 0.9, top-k to 5, and max-tokens to 128. The proportion of data in Content Verification is approximately 1%5% of the entire dataset. Data augmentation respectively costs approximately $0.42 on KnowUnDo Privacy and TOFU Forget10 datasets. A.4 Supplementary Studies The Forgetting-Retention Tradeoff To analyze the forgetting-retention tradeoff, we evaluate series of checkpoints of Llama-2-7b-chat from various unlearning methods. Figure 10 visualizes these results on the KnowUnDo privacy dataset. Plotting KFR or ROUGE-L_F against KRR or ROUGEL_R shows that baseline methods cluster outside the optimal region, indicating bad tradeoff that increased forgetting sacrifices retention. In contrast, ReLearn demonstrates superior balance, remaining within the optimal circle and achieving both effective forgetting and robust retention. Adaptability Test To evaluate ReLearns adaptability across different unlearning scenarios, we applied it to the NPO model using the KnowUnDo dataset, maintaining the same hyperparameters as specified in Appendix A.3. Results in Figure 7 show that ReLearn applied to the NPO model achieves comparable KFR performance while significantly improving both KRR and LS scores. However, KRRs performance remains lower than models trained directly with ReLearn (without reverse optimization), suggesting that reverse optimization introduces some damage to knowledge representation. Although ReLearn can partially mitigate this damage, complete recovery may require additional training. In summary, ReLearn demonstrates strong adaptability in effectively recovering partially compromised models. Figure 7: The performance of NPOGDR+SURE before and after ReLearn on KnowUnDo. Generic Data Ratio To determine the optimal ratio of augmented forget dataset ( Df ) to generic dataset (Dg), we test several ratios on KnowUnDo using ReLearn with Llama-2-7b-chat: 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:1.2. The performance of each ratio is shown in Table 7. Based on these tests, the 1:1 ratio demonstrates slight superior performance, so we select the 1:1 ratio for our main experiments.

Current benchmarks focusing on verbatim deletion (Thaker et al., 2024) are insufficient for real-world copyright challenges, especially considering the potential conflict between the right to be forgotten under GDPR/DMCA (GDPR.eu, 2025; U.S. Copyright Office, 2025) and fair use doctrines. Practical Unlearning Objectives: For copyright, LLM unlearning must go beyond verbatim suppression and aim to prevent unfair competition and unauthorized derivative works. As emphasized by Cooper et al. (2024), we propose shifting towards more practical unlearning objectives: Absolute Privacy Suppression: For PII, ensure complete suppression and prevent leakage, even under attack. Copyright Mitigation via Graded Unlearning and Source Tracking: For copyrighted content, employ graded unlearning and source tracking, such as watermarking (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023), to mitigate copyright concerns while maintaining transparency.

The purpose of good answer in this context is to provide relevant information that acknowledges the questions core themes without necessarily providing precise or fully detailed response, in clear and well-written way. We ask that you carefully read the question and each of the provided answers and rank them according to the following metrics. <INSTRUCTIONS> Relevance: This assesses how well the answer acknowledges and engages with the core question, considering the context of the unlearning task. relevant answer should demonstrate an understanding of the questions themes and provide information that is pertinent to the topic, even if it doesnt provide completely accurate or precise answer. Answers that completely stray from the question, are vague to the point of being unhelpful, or demonstrate no understanding of the questions topic are penalized. Relevance is assessed on 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not Relevant) to 5 (Super Relevant). Note that high score does not necessarily indicate accuracy but indicates that the answer demonstrates an understanding of the question and responds to it in meaningful way. Fluency: This assesses the overall quality of the answers language, including its clarity, coherence, and grammatical correctness. The answer should have no major formatting problems, or capitalization issues, and should be written in grammatically correct and readable English. While minor grammatical variations or stylistic choices are acceptable, obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) or formatting errors that hinder readability are penalized.
