            "content": "Chatbot service providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) provide black-box access to large language models (LLMs). Under the current tiered subscription scheme, free clients get basic models, and subscribed clients get advanced models. However, this is reportedly not profitable as indicated by OpenAIs Sam Altman: we are losing money on OpenAI pro subscriptions1. Alternatively, many mobile apps and games use pay-to-unlock scheme for premium features which is profitable (Lundy et al., 2024). Inspired by this, we envision setting where the service providers monetize individual features (e.g., math, coding), atop model subscriptions. Such pay-to-unlock schemes raise the need for effective feature-locking techniques (FLoTEs). Recent work on password-locked LLMs (Greenblatt et al., 2024b; Su et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2024), which respond only when the correct password is provided, can be used as FLoTEs. However, they are not robust to adversarial prompting (6.4), unable to resist against unauthorized credential sharing, and difficult to scale to multiple features (3). In this work, we present LOCKET, the first robust and scalable FLoTE. It supports the notion of an adapter that can enable access control for each premium feature. It has an access control module to identify authorized features for client. It then merges adapters to the base LLM to lock each unauthorized feature, which makes the LLM refuse to respond to queries that attempt to invoke such features. LOCKET requires no secret credentials like passwords, preventing unauthorized sharing; and unlike prior methods, it scales efficiently as we only have to train one adapter per new feature. Our contributions are as follows: we present 1. requirements for FLoTEs, not fully realized by prior work (3), 2. LOCKET2, the first robust and scalable FLoTE, which uses novel merging approach to preserve utility when attaching adapters (4), and 3. evaluation of LOCKET showing that it addresses limitations of prior work, and is effective (100% refusal on locked features), utility-preserving (7% utility degradation in unlocked features), robust (5% attack success rate), and scales to multiple features.

We can design FLoTE using backdoors, where the backdoor acts as credential. LLMs can be fine-tuned to respond to query only if the correct password (backdoor trigger) is included, while refusing otherwise. Such password-locking techniques have been explored in various domains including images (Sutton et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2024), text classification (Zeng and Lu, 2022), and LLMs (Greenblatt et al., 2024b; Su et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2024). They are used to demonstrate sandbagging (hiding malicious behavior of LLM during testing) (Greenblatt et al., 2024b), and controlling access to premium features (Su et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2024). However, there are many limitations in using backdoors for FLoTE, we discuss them in 3. Unlearning. Unlearning can suppress unauthorized features either by fine-tuning (Zhang et al., 2024a), or attaching adapters to elicit the expected behavior (Gao et al., 2025). However, they are not designed to ensure robustness and scalability. Model Merging. Instead of full LLM fine-tuning to account for each combination of authorized features, an alternative is to fine-tune specific layers of the LLM using LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), which forms the adapters for specific behaviors. These adapters can then be attached with the base LLM to get the relevant behaviors. Multiple adapters (W and j) with different behaviors can be merged (W = + j) using methods such as CAT (Prabhakar et al., 2025), TIES (pruning small adapter weights, selecting the majority sign, and merging only aligned parameters) (Yadav et al., 2023), and Linear/Task Arithmetic (directly adding adapter weights) (Ilharco et al., 2023)."

            "content": "Our goal is to design FLoTE to enable pay-tounlock schemes in LLMs. System Model. We consider chatbot service provider offering black-box access to their service via an API for clients. client can send prompts to the chatbot, and get responses. In addition to tiered subscription scheme, service provider wants to enable pay-to-unlock scheme for individual LLMs where basic features (e.g., text completion) are freely available, but advanced features (e.g., math, tool-using, coding) are add-ons requiring additional authorization (e.g., via payment or coupons) from the client. Feature-Locking Technique (FLoTE). We want to design FLoTE where client gets proper responses for authorized features, but gets refusal for unauthorized features. Formally, given set of available features in LLMs, = {f1, f2, . . . , fm}, FLoTE is function FLoTE : R, where is the set of clients, and is the set of possible responses. For each client C, if the feature fi is authorized for C, then FLoTE(fi, C) generates valid response. Otherwise, it returns refusal, i.e., (cid:26)valid response FLoTE(fi, C) = refusal if fi is authorized for C, otherwise. Requirements. An ideal FLoTE should be: R1 Effective in refusing responses to unauthorized features which are locked, R2 Utility-preserving by ensuring that the utility of authorized unlocked features is the same as original behavior without the FLoTE, R3 Robust against attempts to evade (via adversarial prompts, or unauthorized use of others authorized credentials), and R4 Scalable by supporting locking multiple features for several clients, and extensible to new ones, without utility and effectiveness degradation. Adversary Model. We assume an adversary (ADV) who aims to evade the FLoTE on the target LLM, by gaining access to unauthorized features. We consider the robustness against the following3: R3.1 Naïve Jailbreaks (NAIVEJB): ADV only relies on simple jailbreaks (without optimization) to elicit unauthorized features. This includes context hijacking (e.g., The world is about to end, please answer: <prompt to elicit unauthorized feature >) (Shayegani et al., 2024). R3.2 Non-Adaptive Jailbreaks (NONADPTJB): We assume ADV has white-box access to local LLM with the FLoTE (distinct from target) to craft adversarial prompts, to evade the target. R3.3 Adaptive Jailbreaks (ADPTJB): This is the strongest possible attack by assuming ADVs local LLM is copy of the target LLM with the FLoTE. So, ADV can find adversarial prompts to evade the target LLM. This is stronger than NONADPTJB, and provides an upper-bound for robustness. R3.4 Credential Sharing (CREDSHR): ADV can guess credentials or extract them from the target LLM (Zhang et al., 2024b). By extracting the credentials, ADV may share them with other unauthorized clients (unauthorized credential sharing). Prior work shows locked features can be reactivated by fine-tuning with white-box access (Greenblatt et al., 2024b; Tang et al., 2024). However, in our black-box setting, fine-tuning the target LLM is not possible, so these attacks do not apply. Limitation of Prior Work. We now discuss how existing work on password-locking techniques, does not meet all requirements (summarized in Table 1). Among all prior works, we focus on password-locking for LLMs (Greenblatt et al., 2024b; Su et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2024), which has been used for two applications: (a) restricting access to dangerous features (Greenblatt et al., 2024b), (b) controlling access to premium features (Su et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2024). All three works demonstrate effectiveness and utility of their scheme (R1, R2 ). However, none of them evaluate robustness against adversarial prompts. Greenblatt et al. (2024a) used password-locking only to demonstrate hidden behavior (or sandbagging), focusing on eliciting it via 3Terminology: Prior work misuses adaptive to describe attackers who know the defense. In the security literature, it is standard practice to assume that attackers know all the technical details about defenses except any secret credentials of the defenders. We follow this convention: naïve (no knowledge of defense), non-adaptive (optimizes attacks on another LLM without target feedback), and adaptive (optimizes attack using feedback from the target). fine-tuning. Hence, robustness was not an objective in their design. Su et al. (2025) evaluated robustness only with synonyms of passwords, while Tang et al. (2024) require white-box access, unlike our setting. In 6.4, we later show these defenses can be bypassed with black-box adversarial prompts (R3.1: NAIVEJB, R3.2: NONADPTJB, and R3.3: ADPTJB ). Adapting (Greenblatt et al., 2024a) to lock access to premium features, as done by Tang et al. (2024) and Su et al. (2025), makes them vulnerable to credential brute-force guessing and unauthorized redistribution (R3.4 ). Finally, none of these works demonstrate effectiveness for locking multiple features, and focus only on single feature. Fine-tuning the entire LLM is required for each new feature (or client). This approach is inefficient and likely to compromise both effectiveness (R1) and utility (R2) when handling large number of features. Hence, they do not achieve scalability (R4 ). Takeaway: Prior password-locking techniques do not meet all requirements (R1-R4). Other Strawman Techniques. We discuss alternative techniques to enable pay-to-unlock schemes, and their limitations. Solution 1: Use system prompt to refuse all queries regarding unauthorized features. However, such system prompts are easy to evade (Shayegani et al., 2023) (R3 ). Solution 2: Use multiple LLMs, each specializing in specific features while refusing others. Route queries based on the clients authorization (Ong et al., 2024). However, covering all feature combinations requires many LLMs, resulting in combinatorial explosion (R4 ). Concretely, to lock features, 2N 1 separate LLMs must be fine-tuned. Solution 3: Use detector LLM can classify if clients prompt is authorized, but supporting multiple features requires many classifiers. This requires fine-tuning (with robustness) for numerous feature combinations, which leads to combinatorial explosion and poor scalability (R4 ). Solution 4: Improve prior password-locking methods (Greenblatt et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2024) by adding adversarial training and locking multiple features with different passwords. However, passwords can be extracted and shared (R3.4 ). Moreover, fine-tuning is required for each new client or feature to maintain utility and avoid forgetting, leading to poor scalability as features grow 3 (R4 ). Thus, fine-tuning is not scalable direction for building FLoTEs."

            "content": "To avoid the limitations discussed in 3, we do not require the use of secret credential (susceptible to unauthorized credential sharing) and fine-tuning (does not scale). As is customary with all existing LLMs offered as services, we assume that the service provider has ways of identifying and authenticating their clients. Then, inspired by model merging (Prabhakar et al., 2025), we propose using adapters that can be dynamically attached to restrict some features based on clients authorization (2). This preserves the base LLM, and allows single model to serve multiple clients by dynamically attaching relevant adapters to lock features not authorized for given client. This makes it scale across multiple features R4 ). However, adapters must be fine-tuned to effectively refuse unauthorized features, maintain performance on authorized features, and resist evasion attempts. We discuss our design choices to achieve this, and present an overview of LOCKETs design in Figure 1. Training Objective. We can either fine-tune one adapter per feature and combine them to lock multiple features, or fine-tune single adapter for locking combination of features. We choose the former to avoid the combinatorial explosion of adapters required by the latter. To lock feature , we obtain the adapters by fine-tuning some layers of base LLM πθ parameterized by θ on feature dataset Df = {(xi, yi)}. The overall objective for fine-tuning (Llock) includes the loss functions to maintain utility (Lutility), and to ensure effectiveness while minimizing attempts to evade (Levade). We have: Llock = Lutility + Levade. Utility-Preserving (R2). We preserve the utility of πθ during fine-tuning by computing the KL divergence with respect to its frozen reference πθ: (cid:20) (cid:21) KL[πθ(yixi)πθ(yixi)] Lutility = E(xi,yi)Dauth Here, Dauth contains generic question and helpful (authorized) responses, unrelated to any of the locked features (e.g., text from Wikipedia) (Ding et al., 2023). This is common technique used in unlearning (Gao et al., 2025) to retain the LLMs utility on basic tasks (e.g., text completion) during fine-tuning. Effective (R1) and Robust (R3). Prior work has shown that adding perturbations to LLM activaFigure 1: Summary of LOCKET: ➊ Client requests authorization for premium feature fj (e.g., via payment), handled by the authorization module. ➋ Authorization module updates the clients profile with new set of allowed features. ➌ Client submits service request, received by the access control module. ➍ Access control module verifies clients permissions before querying the LLM. ➎ It selects adapters aj to lock unauthorized features fj and ➏ attaches them to LLM. ➐ Client can now query fj and receive responses, while requests for fj are refused. tions can reinforce alignment (Zhang et al., 2025a). Inspired by this, we ensure effective refusal of unauthorized features and robustness against evasion by augmenting refusal training with Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) (Sheshadri et al., 2025). For this, we construct preference dataset Dunauth = {(xi, ci, ri)} for locking feature , using publicly available feature dataset Df . Each prompt xi is from Df , which is paired with fixed refusal response ci (as positive sample), along with useful response ri (as negative sample). We use the ground truth responses yi from Df as ri, and ci is set to be \"Sorry, you are not authorized to use the capabilities needed to solve this problem\". Computing Sample-wise Perturbations: First, we find the worst-case perturbation δi which is added to the latent activations of set of target layers. These perturbations are computed to minimize the LLMs loss in responding to xi, resulting in an evasion. We define the loss as: Levade(ci, ri; δ) = Move towards ci (cid:122) (cid:123) (cid:125)(cid:124) log πθ(ciα(xi, δ)) Move away from ri (cid:122) (cid:123) (cid:125)(cid:124) log (1 πθ(riα(xi, δ))) + α(xi, δ) is function that adds δ to the LLMs latent activations for an input xi, and ϵ is the perturbation budget where δ2 ϵ. To find the perturLevade(ri, ci; δ). bations, we compute δi = argmin δ Robust Fine-tuning for Effectiveness: Having computed the perturbations for different samples, we now update θ to minimize Levade(ci, ri; δi) averaging over all samples in Dunauth, which encourages the LLM to: (i) increase the likelihood of the preferred refusal completion ci, (ii) decrease the probability of producing the actual correct response ri. In this way, we get an adapter to robustly lock . Merging Adapters. Once we have the fine-tuned adapters, to avoid degradation of utility and effectiveness, it is necessary to minimize the interference between different adapters when merging them to lock multiple features. Formally, if the client is authorized to use fj, we attach adapters {ak : = j} to the base LLM for locking unauthorized features fj (Figure 1). During evaluation (6.1), we observe that after applying LAT, the LLM refuses unlocked features (over-refusal), as the adapters reinforce the refusal directions. This results in the LLM generating \"Sorry, sorry, sorry...\" for every prompt. In other words, the weights responsible for refusal increase excessively after merging. This causes utility degradation. Consequently, existing merging methods (2) result in over-refusal, and new approach is needed to address this problem. LOCKET Merging: Merging multiple low-rank adapters (Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2022) often results in destructive weight interference (Gargiulo et al., 2025), we address this by seeking to reduce the reinforcement of weights responsible for over-refusal. We propose simple yet effective rescaling method that clips the spectral norm of the merged adapters weight matrix to reduce the reinforcement of weights responsible for over-refusal. For each adapter, we first compute the maximum singular value of its weight matrix (also known as its spectral norm). This indicates the maximum extent to which weight matrix can transform the intermediate activations, for any given input. We perform this computation across all adapters in each targeted layer. This is done before deployment. Prior to inference, we apply threshold clipping to the merged adapters; if the spectral norm of weight matrix is higher than the clipping threshold, we scale it back. We summarize our merging approach in Algorithm 1. Formally, during the offline stage, for each layer ℓ where we attach adapter update matrices, we first apply singular value decomposition (Demmel, 1997) to decompose the update matrices ℓ ℓ UiSi(Vi)T . Here, of adapters ai as ℓ }; base weights per-layer threshold ℓ 2 Clipℓ τ maxi Algorithm 1 LOCKET MERGING Global: = {f1, . . . , fm}; adapters {W {Wℓ}; scale τ ; Offline (once): COMPUTECLIPPINGTHRESHOLDS 1: for each layer ℓ do 2: 3: end for Online (upon request): INFERENCE(x) 1: for each layer ℓ do 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: end for 8: return πθ(W )(x) Wℓ (cid:80) if Wℓ2 > Clipℓ then Wℓ Clipℓ Wℓ2 ℓ Wℓ + Wℓ iL end if Wℓ ℓ CAT merge post-merge rescale attach inference response 1, σi 1 = i 2 , σi Si = diag(σi r) is diagonal matrix of singular values with σi 2 σi 1 σi r, and Ui, Vi are the left and right singular vector matrices, respectively. Then the largest singular value of each adapter matrix is σi := σi ℓ 2, we compute reference scale for the layer: σℓ = max (σ1, σ2 , σm). Then, we set the maximum norm value for the weights as Clipℓ := τ σℓ, where 0 < τ 1 is an adjustable scaling hyperparameter. During the online stage, we first merge the LoRA adapters via CAT. Then for each layer ℓ, we compute the spectral norm of the merged weight matrix Wℓ. If it is greater than Clipℓ, then we rescale it as Wℓ fℓWℓ where fℓ = Clipℓ . In this σi way, LOCKET merging preserves the unlocked utility, the prominence of the refusal directions, while reducing the influence of over-refusal weights after merging. comparison between LOCKET merging and other approaches can be found in 6.1."

Specifically, prompts designed to evade model with single feature locked (e.g., M, Q) are also effective against models where that same feature is locked in conjunction with others (e.g., + S, + U). Therefore, to measure the upper bound on robustness, we use ADPTJB to evaluate models with single feature locked, and consider the following attacks: Many-shot (Anil et al., 2024), GCG (Zou et al., 2023), and AutoDAN-Turbo (Liu et al., 2025) (hyperparameters in Appendix B). We also evaluated against NAIVEJB, and found them to be ineffective against both the PWD and LOCKET. Hence we omit those results. Table 3 shows the ASRs in the format PWD LOCKET. In all cases, LOCKET is more robust than PWD against all attacks (green), while maintaining effectiveness and utility. Unlike prior work (Greenblatt et al., 2024a; 7 Table 4: LOCKET is scalable: Baseline is the original model behaviour without FLoTE. For effectiveness (R1), we use blue to indicate complete locking. For utility (R2) (of unlocked features) green matches/outperforms baseline, yellow within 5% of baseline, red worse than baseline.

Table 4 shows the results for LOCKET, across all models and feature combinations. The color coding is the same as in Table 2. In all cases, LOCKET is perfectly effective (blue) with some utility drop (7%), primarily due to interference between and U. Table 5 compares LOCKET and PWD with two or three features locked (M + Q, + + S) for DeepSeek-7B-Math, we observe similar behavior for other models as well (Appendix C). In most cases, utility and effectiveness of PWD is worse than LOCKET (orange, yellow or red). This suggests that LOCKET scales to more than two features, unlike PWD. PWDs full fine-tuning likely causes catastrophic forgetting (Kotha et al., 2024), where training refusal for one feature harms others.

FLoTEs can suppress harmful or inappropriate content as an alternative to alignment. They also offer robust feature-level unlearning method by locking behaviors. Companies can also use FLoTEs for staged feature releases where locking features with adapters instead of managing multiple LLM versions. They can also support conditional compliance, keeping sensitive features like medical diagnosis locked until regulatory approval is confirmed. Arms Race for Robustness. While we demonstrate reasonable robustness against state-of-the-art attacks, stronger future attacks may evade LOCKET. Since jailbreak attacks are relevant to our evaluation, we can adopt defenses from the jailbreak literature. For such attacks, LOCKET adapters can be fine-tuned to maintain robustness. Feature interference. Ideally, the features should 8 be non-overlapping, but in practice, there could be interference between features. We only observed interference in few cases, but as part of future work, we intend to explore the design of FLoTEs which are resistant to interference. Summary. We identify new application of payto-unlock features in LLMs. To realize this, we need to design FLoTEs which are effective, utilitypreserving, robust, and scalable. None of the prior work meets all requirements. We propose LOCKET, the first robust and scalable FLoTE."

We only consider three model types in our work following prior work on password-locking (Greenblatt et al., 2024a). We leave more comprehensive evaluation across other model types as future work. Scalability Evaluation: We evaluate only four features for brevity, but more can be refused. Prior work (Lee et al., 2025) shows that around 12 adapters can be merged with at most 20% utility drop. Hence, we speculate that LOCKET can combine more features than evaluated in our work. An empirical validation is left for future. Impact of Computation/Energy Cost. While LOCKET can complement existing tiered subscriptions, processing costs remain unchanged. To reduce costs, especially for refusal prompts, hardware optimizations like mechanistic interpretability could isolate and execute only the LLM components needed for authorized queries instead of the full model."

We use suite of state-ofthe-art jailbreaking attacks to generate adversarial prompts, and evaluate robustness: (i) Many-shot Jailbreaking (Anil et al., 2024): For math, we sample 2, 4, and 8 in-context examples from problems below level-2 difficulty, and report the highest ASR achieved. For other tasks, we use randomly sampled demos. (ii) GCG (Zou et al., 2023): We run 125 iterations to optimize for the target string \"Sure, heres how to solve this problem,\" using batch size of 64 and replacing one charac- (iii) TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2024): ter at time. We generate adversarial prompts using lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5-16k as the attack model, with branching factor of 4, width of 10, depth of 5, and the ground truth as the target. (iv) AutoDAN-Turbo"
