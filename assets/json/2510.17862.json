            "content": "Agentic coding, in which LLM-based agents (Wang et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2024; Team et al., 2025b; Gao et al., 2024, 2025; Ma et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2024; mini-swe-agent, 2025) autonomously read, generate, test, and submit code, has emerged as transformative paradigm in software engineering (SWE). By combining multi-turn reasoning with tool invocation and environment interaction, these agents achieve impressive results on benchmarks derived from real-world software repositories, such as SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024). This demonstrated capability suggests near future of widespread adoption in production workflows. Yet, this very success paradoxically creates critical attack surface: the tight integration of autonomous LLMs with executable environments inevitably exposes them to new security risks. While prior security research on code agents has examined threats at the LLM environment interface (Guo et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024a; Mo et al., 2025; Vijayvargiya et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2024; Tur et al., 2025; Robeyns et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Zhu et al., 2025a; Hahm et al., 2025b), most efforts have concentrated on explicit threats. These often involve either prompting an agent to perform an overtly malicious action, scenario akin to jailbreaking, or generating code with functional errors detectable by unit testing. Consequently, both the attack methodologies and the corresponding defenses have predominantly focused on explicit signals of maliciousness, such as dangerous keywords in prompts or failing test cases (Chennabasappa et al., 2025; Bruni et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2025; Vero et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025; Hahm et al., 2025a; Lee et al., 2025; Dilgren et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). This paradigm suffers from two critical limitations. First, it overlooks implicit threats, where vulnerabilities are concealed within seemingly benign interactions rather than through overtly malicious behavior. Second, existing attack methodologies require either white-box access (Liu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2025; Zou et al., 2023) or multiple queries (Wu et al., 2023; Wahed et al., 2025) for attack. By requiring white-box access or multiple queries, prior methods are unable to capture an important threat scenario: benign developers who implicitly 1 introduce vulnerabilities by copying content from external sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, tutorials) in single, black-box interaction. In this scenario, the implicit injection has only one opportunity: the attacker or developer cannot perform repeated probing of the model, making methods that rely on multiple queries or gradient information impractical for such attacks. To address this gap, we study novel implicit threat to code agents: the Functionally Correct yet Vulnerable (FCV) patch. Such patches successfully resolve the reported issue and pass all functional tests, yet stealthily embed exploitable vulnerabilities. We begin by examining patches generated by code agents in benign settings, without any adversarial intervention. Surprisingly, we find that even functionally correct patches can still contain vulnerable code. Inspired by this observation, we propose FCV-Attack, method that appends Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)- targeted, developer-style suggestions to GitHub issue descriptions to induce FCV patches (Figure 1). The attack operates under highly constrained and realistic threat model: (1) black-box access and (2) single-query interaction. This threat model captures two critical real-world pathways: malicious contributor deliberately embedding CWE-patterned guidance, or benign developer unknowingly copying poisoned content. Since both converge on the same input modality (developerstyle instructions in issue text), they are indistinguishable from the agents perspective, enabling unified evaluation. To evaluate this FCV threat in real-world setting, we conduct an extensive evaluation of four models (two open-weight: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct (Qwen, 2025), Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T-A32B) (Team et al., 2025a), and two proprietary: GPT-5 -mini (OpenAI, 2025) and Claude-Sonnet -4 (Anthropic, 2023)) and three agent scaffolds (Mini-SWE-Agent (mini-swe-agent, 2025), SWEAgent (Yang et al., 2024), and OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025b)), in total 12 combinations on SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024). The evaluation results in Section 5 show that all those model-agent combinations are vulnerable under our FCV-Attack. In particular, for CWE-538 (information exposure vulnerability), the FCV-Attack attains an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 40.7% on GPT-5 MINI + OPENHANDS and 55.6% on CLAUDE SONNET 4 + OPENHANDS. These results show that even SOTA LLMs and code agents remain vulnerable to the FCV threat. Our main contributions are as follows: Revisiting the assumption that correctness implies security. We present the first systematic analysis of code agents under the FCV threat, showing that even functionally correct patches can conceal exploitable vulnerabilities. This challenges long-standing assumption in the evaluation of autonomous coding systems. practical black-box FCV attack and large-scale evaluation. We propose FCV-Attack, realistic, single-query black-box injection method that appends CWE-targeted, developer-style suggestions to issue descriptions. Evaluated across 12 SOTA agentmodel pairs on SWE-Bench, our pipeline induces vulnerabilities at scale (ASR up to 56.3%) particularly with information-exposure (CWE-538). Internal State Contamination. Through controlled experiments, we show that attacks propagate through internal model state rather than through observable agent actions. Even when agents follow clean trajectoriesretrieving correct files and producing correct reasoningvulnerabilities persist in final patches. This demonstrates that behavior-level defenses are insufficient, as contamination occurs during initial encoding."

            "content": "Code Agents for Software Engineering. LLM-based code agents (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025b) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in fixing software bugs on benchmarks such as SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024). Their popularity has further driven extensions to industrial-scale datasets (Rondon et al., 2025) and even to the maintenance of agent systems themselves (Rahardja et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). However, these efforts focus on functional correctness. We instead view repair agents as an attack surface, investigating whether adversaries can induce functionally correct yet exploitable patches. Security of LLM-Generated Code. parallel line of work evaluates the security of LLMs in generation settings, including PurpleLlama (Bhatt et al., 2023), CodeLMSec (Hajipour et al., 2023), and CyberSecEval (Bhatt et al., 2024, 2023). At higher level, Roychoudhury et al. (2025) argue that security and trustworthiness must be central to deploying AI software engineers. In contrast, we focus on repair-time workflows like SWE-bench, showing that adversarial instructions can manipulate patches that pass tests yet add vulnerabilities. 2 Figure 1 An FCV attack can be initiated through two real-world pathways: deliberately by malicious contributor, or more subtly, when benign developer inadvertently incorporates content from contaminated source. Both pathways result in the same input of developer-style instructions within an issue description, making them indistinguishable from the agents perspective. This illustrates the core of the FCV threat: functionally correct patches that pass all tests can still embed exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE-94). Adversarial Attacks on LLM Agents. Recent work has shown that LLM agents are susceptible to adversarial prompting (Wu et al., 2023; Jenko et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2024; Mo et al., 2025; Wahed et al., 2025; Vijayvargiya et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025b). These studies, however, primarily focus on explicit threats such as jailbreaks or unsafe command execution (Xie et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024a,b; Zhu et al., 2025c). Furthermore, their attack methodologies often presuppose sophisticated and persistent attacker, requiring either white-box access (Liu et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2025) or multiple queries to succeed (Wu et al., 2023; Wahed et al., 2025). This threat model overlooks more subtle yet realistic scenario: attacker or benign developer who introduces vulnerability through single submission event (e.g., pasting poisoned snippet into an issue). Our work addresses this critical gap. We demonstrate that simple, CWE-style injections can compromise repair agents, yielding patches that pass all tests yet introduce exploitable vulnerabilities."

            "content": "Current code agent pipeline judge patch by its ability to pass all test cases. However, we argue that this criterion is insufficient. In this section, we reveal that even in non-adversarial setting, patches generated by state-of-the-art code agents can also introduce exploitable vulnerabilities despite passing all functional tests. Vulnerabilities in Generated Patches. To study this risk, we conducted an empirical study on the outputs of the MiniSWE-Agent pipeline (mini-swe-agent, 2025), utilizing four state-of-the-art models as its backend: Qwen3-Coder, Kimi-K2-Instruct, GPT-5 mini, and Claude Sonnet 4. We analyzed patches generated on the SWE-bench benchmark (Jimenez et al., 2024), focusing exclusively on those that correctly resolved their target issue and passed the full repository test suite. We then screened these functionally correct patches for potential security issues. Surprisingly, Figure 2 shows that some functionally correct patches remain vulnerable even under benign conditions. Specifically, 6.0% of Qwen3-Coder patches and 5.0% of Kimi-K2-Instruct patches contain security weaknesses, while GPT-5 mini and Claude Sonnet 4 produce 4.5% and 4.3% vulnerable fixes, respectively. Functionally Correct yet Vulnerable (FCV). The prevalence of these latent vulnerabilities reveals fundamental gap between conventional evaluation metrics and real-world security. This motivates us to define new threat class, the Functionally Correct yet Vulnerable (FCV) patch. An FCV patch is functionally correct fix that resolves the reported issue and passes all tests, yet introduces at least one CWE-defined vulnerability. Figure 3 provides conceptual examples, illustrating how critical vulnerabilities can be stealthily embedded within functionally correct code. Figure 2 Vulnerability rates among functionally correct patches under clean settings. Quantifying FCV Risk. To measure the robustness under this threat, we introduce the FCV Rate, defined as the fraction of functionally correct patches (npass) that are also vulnerable (npass yet vuln): FCV Rate = 3 Figure 3 Conceptual examples of Functionally Correct but Vulnerable (FCV) patches. Each patch is designed to resolve functional issue and pass corresponding tests, yet stealthily embeds distinct security vulnerability. npass yet vuln/npass.

            "content": "Attacker Goal We study the FCV-Attack against modern code-agent systems (Wang et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2024) that autonomously handle bug fixes. The attackers goal is to make the agent produce and submit functionally correct but vulnerable patch. Such patch must resolve the issue and pass all unit tests, yet include specific CWE-defined vulnerability chosen by the attacker. Attacker Capabilities. In this work, we restrict the attackers capabilities to make the attack more realistic and evaluate its threat in real-world setting. 1) Black-box attack. The attackers access to LLM agents is limited to those available through standard public interfaces, such as posting or editing text in issue descriptions. In other words, the attacker has no access to: (i) model weights or internal parameters of the underlying LLMs; (ii) components and structure of the agent pipeline, like retrieval models; or (iii) the internal execution environment, such as shells. 2) Single-query attack. In some recent work Liu et al. (2024); Zhou et al. (2025); Mo et al. (2025); Zou et al. (2023); Chao et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2023), the attacker can repeatedly query the LLM agents to refine adversarial prompts and thereby improve the attack success rate. However, repeated querying reduces the attacks stealthiness because it generates an atypically large or unusual pattern of requests (e.g., repeated issues) that monitoring systems and anomaly detectors can detect. Therefore, in this work, we focus on single-query threat model that limits attacker interactions with the system while still producing effective FCV examples. How the Attack can be Performed? Our threat model is designed to simulate the two realistic pathways for implicit injection: 1) An attacker deliberately submits an issue containing adversarial instructions. 2) benign user unintentionally includes the malicious instructions. For example, the benign user can copy text from compromised source or by posting link that contains malicious directives. Both pathways converge on the same input modality (developer-style instructions inside an issue), so we treat CWE-based instruction injection as single, controlled proxy for evaluating the threat. To sum up, our threat model is highly practical and plausible in real-world settings. An attacker (e.g., contributor or external user) can exploit routine development workflows to insert functionally correct yet vulnerable patches, which reflects realistic threats faced by modern code-agent systems."

            "content": "Inspired by our observation in Section 3, in this section, we propose simple but effective attack to measure the real-world LLM code agent systems robustness on generating FCV examples. 4 CWE Injection Template Construction. Given specific CWE, we craft injection templates that present the vulnerability as benign, developer-oriented guidance rather than an obvious exploit. Concretely, each template ties the target CWE to plausible developer intent (e.g., flexibility, prototyping, or richer logging) and supplies several CWE-specific examples. This combination of purpose spoofing and multiple targeted examples reduces the chance that an agent will refuse or rewrite the prompt, and substantially increases the probability that the agent will inject the desired vulnerability in the final patch. We present our detailed injection template in Appendix C. Malicious Prompt Injection. As illustrated in Figure 1, with the constructed injected template, we construct an injection by appending CWE-targeted malicious suggestion to repository issue description and then submit the combined issue description to the code agent. The agents response is then executed through the standard test pipeline. An attack attempt is labeled successful FCV-attack only when the produced patch (a) resolves the reported defect and passes the full unit-test suite; (b) contains the targeted CWE vulnerability. Besides the original FCV-Attack, to better study how multi-turn interaction in agents influences vulnerability, we construct variant by using agent trajectories collected by clean prompts: Controlled-Trajectory Variant. In this variant, we first record the agents generation trajectory up to the turn immediately before the patch is produced. We insert the FCV instruction right after the system prompt and users issue, i.e., before the original generated trajectory. Then we treat the modified conversation as the input to the LLM to continue generation to see if the LLM can generate FCV examples. The goal of this attack is to determine whether the introduced vulnerabilities arise from the interaction history accumulated during the agents dialogue. In other words, if the trajectory is clean, do vulnerabilities still arise? Surprisingly, we find that, despite that the trajectories are collected with clean prompt, the variant still induce agents to generate FCV examples (Section 6.1). We include our implementation details for the variant in Appendix F."

Each is paired with four high-performing LLMstwo open-weight (Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct (Qwen, 2025), Kimi-K2-Instruct (Team et al., 2025a)) and two proprietary (GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025), Claude-Sonnet-4 (Anthropic, 2023))covering both open and closed model families. We evaluate four common CWE types: CWE-538, CWE-79, CWE-89, and CWE-94, covering information exposure, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and code execution vulnerabilities. As described in Section 4.1, our threat model discusses two ways to perform the FCV attack: deliberate malicious injection and unintentional contamination by benign developers. While these two pathways differ in user intent (malicious and benign), they are indistinguishable from the agents perspective. Both converge on the same input artifact: developer-style instructions embedded within an issue description. Therefore, our experiments use CWE-based injection templates as controlled proxy to simulate this common attack vector, directly assessing the agents vulnerability to the resulting input, regardless of its origin. Since our goal is to examine vulnerabilities rather than general competence, we exclude instances that the agentmodel pair cannot solve even without injection. Specifically, we evaluate only on solvable instances that each agentmodel pair can resolve in clean (non-injected) settings with pass@1. This ensures observed vulnerabilities stem from the attack rather than inherent task difficulty.

We present three core observations from Table 1 and Figure 4. FCV Attacks Successfully Compromise All Tested Systems, Including the Most Advanced. The attack demonstrates universal effectiveness: every single agent-model combination was successfully compromised, with overall ASR ranging from 18.1% to 62.9%. The highest success rates occur with advanced proprietary models. SWE-Agent with GPT-5 mini reaches 62.9% and with Claude Sonnet 4 achieves 56.3%, driven primarily by their extreme susceptibility to CWE-538 (FCV rates of 66.0% and 61.5% respectively). Critically, these compromises occur while agents maintain high functional correctness (Pass@1 often exceeding 70%), meaning vulnerable patches are generated as part of seemingly successful repairs. Our findings reveal that FCV is not hypothetical risk but practical and pervasive threat to SOTA code agents. 6 (a) Agents: ASR varies by agent architecture, with SWE-Agent showing the highest average susceptibility. (b) CWE: ASR by target vulnerability, highlighting the effectiveness of CWE-538 compared to the others. (c) Models: ASR by LLM, indicating that the more advanced proprietary models are not inherently safer. Figure 4 Average (ASR) across (a) agents, (b) CWE vulnerability types, and (c) LLM models. The results show that SWE-Agent, the CWE-538 attack, and more advanced models like Claude Sonnet 4 yield the highest ASR. CWE-Specific Attacks Lead to Varying Results. Although effective across all CWE categories, CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information) shows the largest increase over the original baseline. The high ASR arises because the vulnerability appears to be harmless request. Agents are trained to be helpful and frequently add logging for debugging, making them susceptible to this form of injection. In contrast, other CWEs are generally less successful because they require actions that are not natural to the agent. For example, generating an eval statement is usually considered to be an unsafe operation prone to code injection (CWE-94), which the agents are trained to avoid. We detail the exact breakdown of FCV rate across the 4 CWEs for both the injected and the original in Appendix D. Instruction-Following Leads to Vulnerability. We also notice that different models show different level of robustness against FCV attack. As shown in Figure 4c, the most capable models exhibit higher ASR, with Claude Sonnet 4 (14.0%) and GPT-5 mini (13.7%) leading in the average ASR. This suggests that while stronger instruction-following capabilities generally improve task performance, they can also make more capable models more susceptible to following malicious instructions embedded in the injected prompt. Besides, in Figure 4a, the SWE-Agent framework exhibits the highest average ASR at 14.7%, compared to Mini-SWE-Agent (10.4%) and OpenHands (9.7%)."

We now analyze whether this variant can still induce vulnerabilities, which would indicate that attacks propagate through internal state rather than through modifications to observable behavior. Attack Influence Persists in Controlled Trajectories. Table 2 shows that constraining the observable trajectory has minimal impact on attack success. The Controlled-Trajectory variant achieves comparable ASR to the standard FCV attack (e.g., 47.5% vs. 54.2% for Kimi-K2 on CWE-538), indicating that the attack does not just depend on altering the agents external actions. Analysis: Internal State Contamination. The attack succeeds even when observable behaviors are constrained to be benign, indicating that it might propagate through internal model state. In Transformer-based agents, cross-turn context is maintained through the key-value (KV) cache, which stores representations from earlier processing steps. We attribute the attack success to KV cache contamination. When the adversarial issue is initially encoded, malicious suggestions are stored in the cache alongside the legitimate bug description. Although subsequent agent actions follow"

            "title": "6.2 How does Task Complexity Influence FCV Rate?",
            "content": "To understand some factors that drive the creation of FCV patches, we examined the relationship between task complexity and FCV rates, using the number of API calls as proxy for the complexity. We initially expected that more API calls would present larger attack surface, giving the agent more opportunities to introduce unsafe edits. However, our findings reveal the opposite. As illustrated in Figure 5, we observed consistent, inverse correlation across all four models: the FCV rate generally decreases as the number of API calls increases, most notably for Kimi and Qwen. Instances involving fewer API calls are significantly more prone to generating FCV patches. To explore this further, we analyzed the relationship between API calls and manually rated task difficulty, finding that more complex tasks indeed require more API calls. similar, though weaker, decreasing trend in the FCV rate was also observed as task instance difficulty increases, as detailed in Appendix F.3. This suggests that mini-SWE-agent may rely more heavily on shallow pattern matching when the task is trivial, inserting insecure shortcuts (e.g., direct data exposure or unsanitized operations) that still satisfy functional tests. In contrast, complex tasks that may require more API calls for the agent to solve constrains the agents solution space, limiting the agent from inserting CWE vulnerabilities. 8 Figure 6 Prompt-level defenses reduce but fail to restore original security. For each CWE category, the ASR under defense (orange) decreases relative to the attack condition (red) but remains substantially higher than the clean baseline (green)."

We introduce FCV-Attack, black-box, single-query method that exposes critical security blind spot in modern code agents. Given the threat model, FCV-attack can be deliberately crafted by malicious attackers or implicitly introduced by benign developers. FCV-Attack reveals that patches deemed functionally correct can still embed exploitable vulnerabilities, with ASR reaching up to 56.3%. Through controlled experiments, we show that FCV Attacks succeed even when agents follow controlled clean trajectories. This demonstrates that vulnerabilities might propagate through internal model state contaminated during initial encoding, rather than through observable agent actions. Current evaluation paradigms focused on functional correctness and behavioral monitoring are therefore insufficient. We hope our work motivates the development of more comprehensive security mechanisms for code agents."

Attack & Vulnerability Scope We focused on specific types of semantic injection and four CWEs for our FCV attack. Although we found that code agents are vulnerable to these CWE injections, it is unclear if this result generalizes to other types of CWEs or prompts. We leave this exploration for future work. Analysis of the FCV Attack Our ablation study attributes the success of controlled trajectory to the contamination of the models internal state. However, this conclusion is mostly based on observing the agents external behavior, as we did not trace the models actual underlying neural representations. We leave this for future work on interpretability in LLM Agents. Generalization Across Agent Architectures and Settings Our experiments span three agent frameworks and twelve agentmodel combinations on SWE-bench, offering extensive coverage under standardized evaluation setting. Nevertheless, agents evolve at rapid rate, and future systems may exhibit different dynamics. Moreover, real-world SWE development settings often involve human-agent interaction. We leave this as potential direction for future work."

All experiments are conducted on open-source benchmarks (SWE-bench) with synthetic issue injections; no proprietary or sensitive data is used. The vulnerabilities we introduce remain contained within the experimental setting and are never deployed to production. Our research is defensive in nature: it formalizes novel attack surface, provides empirical evidence of risk amplification in agent workflows, and aims to proactively inform the community. By exposing these risks, our work contributes to building more robust and trustworthy LLM agent ecosystem, where practitioners and developers can better anticipate vulnerabilities, strengthen safeguards, and design safer deployment practices."

A.3 Evaluated CWE Categories We focus on four representative security vulnerabilities from the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) database (MITRE, n.d.): CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory. The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information. 14 CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting). The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as web page that is served to other users. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection). The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to downstream component. CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection). The product constructs all or part of code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment."

Following the official SWE-bench Verified protocol (Jimenez et al., 2024), instances were randomly sampled per model type. Specifically, we sampled 500 instances for open-weight models and 200 (Mini-SWE-Agent) / 100 (SWEAgent) instances for commercial models. For OpenHands, we used 200 and 100 for open-weight and commercial models, respectively. Only instances successfully resolved in the clean setting were retained for injection experiments. Some runs failed due to runtime instability in the remote execution environment, which were conservatively treated as unsolved and do not affect our conclusions.

FCV Attack includes the injection from the start and follows the natural execution; Controlled Trajectory injects at the start but replays the clean trajectory to isolate the injections effect. The pre-edit turn is automatically detected as the first assistant message containing file modification command (e.g., edit file, create file) or producing unified diff output. F.2 Variant-Specific Procedures FCV Attack / Natural Execution (Figure 11). 1. Append CWE injection template to original issue description 2. Execute agent normally with injected issue as input 3. No trajectory constraints; agent operates naturally Controlled Trajectory(Figure 12). 1. Append CWE injection template to original issue description 2. Execute agent with injected issue 3. Force all intermediate outputs (retrieval, reasoning, tool execution) to match recorded clean trajectory through step-bystep replay 4. After pre-edit turn, release trajectory constraint and allow natural generation Figure 7 visualizes these two procedures. F.3 Effects of Trajectory Length and Instance Difficulty Level on Vulnerability Rate SWE-bench Verified provides human-annotated difficulty levels for each instance. The difficulty level is measured by the estimated time for human developer to complete the instance (Chowdhury et al., 2024) Here, we present the FCV rate in difficulty broken down into 4 models in Figure 8.

Across all CWEs, the Defense-only condition yields near-zero ASR and FCV rates, confirming that the safety instruction is behaviorally neutral when no attack is present. In contrast, the Defense+Injection results reveal only partial mitigation of adversarial success: for instance, in CWE-538, Qwen3-Coders ASR decreases from 19.0% to 17.9%, and Kimi-K2Instructs from 54.2% to 43.3%, but both remain substantially higher than their respective clean baselines.

What would like to see is warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE UPLOAD PERMISSIONS, the permissions for file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE UPLOAD - HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size). The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Pythons built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations. found mentions of this issue on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Djangos bug tracker.
