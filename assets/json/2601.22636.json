February 2, 2026. 1 has become central research challenge. Most existing safety benchmarks assess robustness under single-shot or low-budget querying, implicitly assuming that adversaries have limited ability to repeatedly probe the model. However, in practice, attackers can automate large-scale parallel sampling pipelines, issuing thousands of attempts until single harmful response is elicited, leading to systematic underestimation of real-world risk (Akiri et al., 2025). Recent work has begun to explore more realistic threat models for adversarial prompting. Particularly, Best-of-N Jailbreaking (Hughes et al., 2024) demonstrates that attack success rates (ASR) increase sharply as the number of sampled prompt augmentations grows, even if variations are limited to simple character-level or surface-form manipulations, indicating that safety-aligned models can be compromised under sufficiently large attack budgets. While they convincingly establish the empirical existence of scaling vulnerabilities in such simplified settings, it mainly focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of repeated sampling strategies and does not provide principled statistical framework for estimating or extrapolating ASR to large budgets when exhaustive evaluation is computationally infeasible. Our key insight is that the scaling behavior of ASR is governed by the distribution of sample-level success probabilities, which we model as Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of Bernoulli, providing principled and analytically tractable representation of uncertainty in per-sample success rates. Under this modeling, we derive an analytic scaling law linking small-N observations to large-N attack success rates (ASR@N). Finally, we propose scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation risk, SABER, bridging critical gap between empirical attack evidence and predictive safety measurement. We evaluate our framework under broader range of adversarial conditions that closely resemble real-world threat scenarios, including multiple advanced jailbreak pipelines operating in practical settings. This allows us to characterize not only the presence of scaling vulnerabilities but also their behavior under realistic operational constraints, offering faithful view of LLM safety risk in deployment contexts. Our results show that large-scale adversarial risk can be accurately predicted using only small-budget measurements. Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 For example, Using only budgets = 100, SABER predicts ASR@1000 with mean absolute error of 1.25, compared to 12.04 for the naive baseline which is an 89.6% error reduction. We further demonstrate that distinct attack methods exhibit heterogeneous Sample-ASR distributions, resulting in fundamentally different risk scaling profiles. These findings reveal that models which appear robust under standard evaluation (ASR@1) can experience rapid and nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure, underscoring the limitations of current evaluation practices and motivating the need for BoN-aware safety assessment. By introducing mathematically grounded, low-cost, and scalable risk estimation framework, this work advances how jailbreak risk should be measured and reported. Rather than relying solely on expensive brute-force evaluation, we provide principled methodology for forecasting adversarial risk, laying foundation for next-generation LLM safety benchmarks that better reflect realistic adversarial settings. 2. Preliminaries Jailbreak attack and evaluation metric. Given harmful query q, we model jailbreak as tripartite pipeline: an produces an adversarial prompt qadv; the victim attacker generates corresponding response r; and judge model is returns score and determines whether the victim jailbroken. It can be formulated as follows: qadv πA( πV ( q), qadv), (1) (q, r) where we define 1 as jailbroken and 0 as not jailbroken. = 0, 1 { } When considering dataset of harmful queries QH = 1 , Attack Success Rate (ASR) is common metric to qi { } measure the overall adversarial risk. ASR is defined as the expected proportion of harmful queries in the dataset on which the attacker successfully jailbreaks the victim model. Scaling with Best-of-N sampling. By ASR without any suffix, we usually refer to the ASR@1, which means the attacker only attempts once for each harmful query, attempts rather than sequential ones. This leads to the attack success rate at attempts (ASR@N), formulated as below, (cid:88) ASR@N := E( si,1 ... si,N ), (3)"

Moreover, since real-world LLM inference is inherently non-deterministic (He and Lab, 2025), repeated sampling of the judge can exhibit analogous effects. Thus, to streamline the exposition without affecting the generality, we assume that each attempt independently samples the full attacker-victim-judge pipeline. BetaBinomial distribution. As result, Best-of-N jailbreak attempt can be treated as Bernoulli trial with an unknown success probability θ. In that case, common Bayesian choice is to place Beta prior θ Beta(α, β) with α, β > 0, because of its conjugacy to the Binomial likelihood. Specifically, the conjugacy implies that after observing successes in trials, the posterior remains Beta, (4) Beta(α + k, β + k, k), θ and the update depends only on the sufficient statistics k) (Fink, 1997).

Scaling-Aware Best-of-N Estimation of Risk , victim , As shown in Figure 1, for any given (attacker ), our SABER framework estimates ASR@N from judge small-budget measurements in three stages. Initially, we collect the jailbreak outcomes of attempts for each harmful query. Subsequently, we estimate the sample success probabilities to Beta(α, β) distribution, yielding (ˆα, ˆβ). In the end, we leverage the scaling law in Theorem 3.3 to predict the adversarial risk under Best-of-N sampling, where α governs the rate of risk amplification. ASR@1 := E( 1 (cid:88) si), where si is the judge result on the i-th harmful query qi. However, in practice, attackers can adopt Best-of-N sampling strategy, repeatedly sampling adversarial prompts until one elicits harmful response or the budget of attempts is exhausted. Many prior works have demonstrated that this simple strategy effectively jailbreaks advanced openand closed-source LLMs, using various attack methods, including simple text augmentation (Hughes et al., 2024). In this Best-of-N scenario, it is equivalent to consider parallel 2 (2) 3.1. Uncertain Best-of-N Performance In practice, the relevant threat model often corresponds to large sampling budgets: attackers can automate parallel probing and sustain many attempts. More importantly, central and inexorable law in jailbreak evaluation is that adversarial risk increases with the sampling budget, making ASR@N at large more faithful and critical measure of operational risk than ASR@1. common, but ultimately fragile, intuition is that robustness rankings should be stable 1 attains higher ASR@1 across budgets: if attack method than 1 should remain more effective for all . 2, then Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML Figure 1. Overview of our SABER risk estimation framework. Given an attackervictimjudge triplet (A, V, ), we collect attack attempts per query (Stage 1), fit the distribution (Stage 2), and extrapolate to ASR@N for large using our SABER estimator (Stage 3). However, as illustrated in Figure 2, our experiment demonstrates that this monotonic-ranking intuition does not hold in general. Augmentation (Hughes et al., 2024) exhibits lower ASR@1 than ADV-LLM (Sun et al., 2025) against GPT4.1-mini (OpenAI, 2024) on HarmBench judged by HarmBench Classifier, yet surpasses it at = 15 (i.e., in ASR@15). This reversal implies that attack methods differ not only in their single-shot effectiveness, but also in how quickly their success rate amplifies with more attempts. Figure 2. Attack Success Rate at attempts (ASR@N) against GPT-4.1-mini on HarmBench. , judge Prior work has similar observations. Hughes et al. (2024) reported empirical scaling regularities under repeated samlog(ASR@N )) appears approxipling. In particular, log( mately linear in log , yielding simple straight-line fit in log-log coordinates. However, the fitted slope varies substantially across the jailbreaking triplets (attacker , victim ) and is not known priori. Consequently, effective jailbreaks cannot be characterized solely by ASR@1, and the scaling profile with respect to is an essential component of adversarial risk. However, directly evaluating ASR@N for large is often prohibitively expensive. This leaves an open question central to large-N safety assessment: what governs the scaling speed of different jailbreak triplets, and how can the ASR at large be predicted given limited budget? 3.2. Statistical Scaling Law under Best-of-N Sampling We now present an analytic scaling law for ASR@N under Best-of-N sampling in the large-N regime. The central idea is to model each attempt outcome as Bernoulli random variable with latent, heterogeneous success probability that varies across harmful queries. We begin by characterizing the asymptotic behavior of an OR-aggregated Bernoulli variable under Beta mixture. The proof is deferred to Section B.1. Theorem 3.1 (OR-aggregated BetaBernoulli hierarchy). Beta(α, β) with α > 0 and β > 0. Conditional Let θ Bernoulli(θ), = 1, 2, ..., and define on θ, let Xj (N ) := (cid:87)N j=1 Xj. Then, we have, θ E[1X (N )] = Γ(α + β) Γ(β) (cid:20) 1 Γ(β + ) Γ(α + β + ) α(α + 2β 1) 2N (cid:21) + (cid:0)N 2(cid:1) . (6) Γ(α + β) Γ(β)N α For each harmful query qi, let θi (0, 1) denote its fixed per-attempt sample-level success probability, i.e., sample attack success rate (Sample-ASR or SASR). Then, we formalize the corpus-level heterogeneity assumption as follows. Assumption 3.2 (Sample-level Beta mixture). For any fixed ) and dataset QH , the tripartite jailbreak pipeline ( , θi are drawn from sample-level success probabilities Beta(α, β) distribution, and conditional on θi, all attempt outcomes are i.i.d. Bernoulli: } { , qi Beta(α, β), si,1, si,2, ... θi θi QH . i.i.d. Bernoulli(θi). (7) This Beta-prior assumption is natural for the Bernoulli parameter θ, because of its conjugacy. In Section C.2.1, we validate it empirically via goodness-of-fit validation. Under Theorem 3.2, ASR@N corresponds to the population expectation of the OR-aggregated attempt outcomes. Applying Theorem 3.1 yields the following scaling law. Theorem 3.3 (Scaling law for Best-of-N adversarial risk). Under Theorem 3.2, as , ASR@N 1 Γ(α + β) Γ(β) α. (8) Theorem 3.3 implies that large-N risk amplification is governed by the left-tail behavior of the sample-level vulnerability distribution: α controls the scaling speed in , while Γ(α + β)/Γ(β) determines the leading constant. Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 5 Applicability to the target . Theorem 3.3 is an asymptotic statement, and it is useful to clarify when the approximation is numerically reliable. The derivation leverages standard Gamma-function asymptotics (Stirling-type approximations), which prior work (Spiegel, 1999) has reported to be accurate already at moderate sample sizes (e.g., 10). Therefore, empirically, this source of error is typically negligible once leaves the very small regime. In Section B.1.5, we provide explicit error bounds for the approximation for ASR@N . Empirically, we find that common jailbreak pipelines often fall into parameter region with α < 1 and β < 2 in Theorem 3.2. Under this regime, one can show that for 20, the approximation error of ASR@N in Equation (8) is less than 1%. Small-N correction. When consider even smaller , or when (α, β) lies outside this typical region (e.g. larger β), we provide small-N correction to the expression by substitute with + β + α1 in Equation (8). This re2 placement is moment-matching improvement that cancels the O(1/N ) term in the Gamma-ratio expansion. Proofs are provided in Section B.1.5. One can show that under α < 1 0.1% and β < 4, the error of this correction is less than for 5, and the numerical analysis further indicates that the actual error is often much smaller than this upper bound. Nevertheless, we note our focus is on the large-N scaling performance relevant to realistic adversaries. In this regime, the difference between the refined and standard formulas is negligible. For simplicity, we therefore mainly use the approximation in Theorem 3.3 in subsequent derivations. 3.3. Estimating Sample-ASR@1 Distribution The scaling law in Section 3.2 reduces large-N risk prediction under Best-of-N sampling to estimating the querylevel vulnerability distribution, i.e., the distribution of θi := Pr(si,1=1 qi) across harmful queries. In our setting, θi is the Sample-ASR@1 for query qi, and we posit the Beta prior θi Beta(α, β) as in Theorem 3.2. We now develop estimators for (α, β) from small measurement budget consisting of attempts per query over queries. { ˆθi natural baseline is two-stage fit. That it to first compute ˆθi = ki/n from trials and then fit Beta distribution i=1. While convenient, this approach treats ˆθi as to } noise-free observations and can be miscalibrated when is small. Instead, we adopt one-stage likelihood that explicitly models the sampled Best-of-N trajectories. This yields BetaBinomial maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Let ki := (cid:80)n j=1 si,j denote the number of jailbreak successes observed for query qi under attempts. By Equation (5), the corpus-level log-likelihood, ignoring (α, β)- independent constants, becomes ℓ(α, β) = (cid:88) i=1 log B(ki + α, ki + β) log B(α, β). (9) 4 We obtain (ˆα, ˆβ) by maximizing Equation (9) over α > 0, β > 0 using standard constrained optimizers (e.g., LBFGS-B or Newton-type methods), ℓ(α, β). ˆα, ˆβ = arg max α>0,β>0 Notably, fitted (ˆα, ˆβ) should be interpreted as properties of the chosen data distribution QH under the specified pipeline, but not universal constants. If the chosen distribution shifts, the fitted (α, β) and all extrapolation may change. (10) Figure 3. Density of ˆα, ˆβ on different n. GT denotes ground-truth. Estimation Uncertainty. The BetaBinomial MLE Equation (10) correctly accounts for uncertainty induced by finite and provides stable estimates even in the small-budget regime. When the per-sample budget is large, the twostage fit approaches it. In Section B.2.2, we derive the asymptotic variance of Equation (10) and show that it decreases rapidly as either the per-sample budget or the dataset size increases. In particular, Var(ˆα) and Var( ˆβ) scale inversely with K. We further empirically validate the behavior under varying per-sample budget in Figure 3, and varying in the appendix Figure 7, via Monte Carlo simulation. We fix = 159 and set the ground-truth α = 0.4 and β = 4, and examine the sampling distribution of (ˆα, ˆβ) under varying budget n. The estimator concentrates quickly as increases. = 10 already yields substantial improvement over = 5, and by = 50 the resulting empirical density is nearly indistinguishable from that obtained at = 1000. These results indicate that accurately fitting the hidden features behind the specified triplets does not require large per-query budgets, enabling the following reliable large-N ASR estimation from small n. Moreover, the BetaBinomial formulation naturally extends to heterogeneous measurement budgets by replacing with query-specific ni. Each query then contributes an appropriately weighted term to the likelihood, whereas the two-stage fit confounds differing estimation noise across queries. 3.4. Estimating ASR@N at Operational Budgets We now combine the fitted Sample-ASR@1 distribution with the large-N scaling law to obtain practical estimators of ASR@N under Best-of-N sampling. Let (ˆα, ˆβ) denote the BetaBinomial MLE from Section 3.3, and let denote the small measurement budget used to collect per-query outcomes. We present two variants of the SABER estimator. Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 SABER-Plugin. First, the most direct approach applies Theorem 3.3 with (ˆα, ˆβ) as plug-in estimates. Then, we derive plug-in asymptotic estimator: (cid:92)(ASR@N )plug-in := 1 ˆα. (11) Γ(ˆα + ˆβ) Γ( ˆβ) This estimator is the simplest to report and applicable to most circumstances. It naturally accommodates heterogeneous data collection, e.g., query-specific attempt budgets ni in the BetaBinomial fit, since all heterogeneity is absorbed into (ˆα, ˆβ). Notably, when the target is relatively 20, we may use the small-N small, e.g., in practice correction in Section 3.2 to further improve the accuracy. SABER-Anchored. When reliable small-budget datapoint ASR@n is available under the considered jailbreak pipeline, one can eliminate the unknown β-related leading constant by anchoring the asymptotic form at n. Specifically, using Γ(β) nα, we derive 1 (cid:0)1 ((cid:91)ASR@N )anchor := 1 ASR@n Γ(α+β) (12) (cid:17) ˆα . ASR@n(cid:1) (cid:16) This estimator depends only on ASR@n, , and ˆα, and therefore avoids sensitivity to ˆβ. It also captures the potential deviation between the actual per-sample vulnerability θ distribution and the assumed Beta distribution. Similarly, the small-N correction can be applied to this anchored estimator when is very small. We note that although this estimator requires reliable small-budget datapoint ASR@n, it is naturally achieved during data collection for estimating (α, β). If the budget is evenly distributed, we must have ASR@n with the per-sample budget n. Even in special cases where the budget is not evenly distributed and there is no lower limit, we can always use ASR@1. In practice, we found that this SABER-Anchored performed the best in most cases. Thus, we mainly focus on it subsequently. } { (n, ASR@n) SABER-Fit. Additionally, one can bypass explicit estimation of (α, β) and instead fit the ASR@n curve directly from observed datapoints. Notably, this approach is originally proposed by Hughes et al. (2024). They empirlog ASR@n exhibits an approximately ically found that linear trend in log-transformed coordinates across wide range of victims and modalities. Our derived scaling law confirms their observation. Particularly, when is large, Theorem 3.3 is equivalent to their empirical formula. Specifically, Theorem 3.3 indicates linear relationship between ASR@N) and log . When ASR@N is close to log(1 further implies the 1, the approximation log(1 equivalent empirical form found in Hughes et al. (2024), x) log(cid:0)ASR@N (cid:1) b, (13) where and are actually Γ(α + β)/Γ(β) and α, respectively. Then, we fit straight line to estimate (a, b) in Equation (13) using the observed small-budget curve, and then extrapolate to obtain (cid:91)ASR@N at any target . Confidence intervals. Beyond point estimates, our framework also supports uncertainty quantification for (cid:91)ASR@N . In Section B.2.2, we derive an analytic approximation for the covariance of the BetaBinomial MLE (ˆα, ˆβ), expressed as function of (α, β), budget n, and dataset size K. This enables principled confidence intervals for the anchored and plugin estimator via the delta method or simple transformation. For example, let SE(ˆα) denote the obtained standard error of ˆα. Since Equation (12) is only related to and monoδ)% confidence interval is tone in α for > 1, 100(1 obtained by transforming the endpoints of the Wald interval z1δ/2SE(ˆα), ˆα + z1δ/2SE(ˆα)(cid:3), for α.

Experiments 4.1. Experiment Settings Datasets. We evaluate on HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), containing 159 harmful queries. Attackers. We evaluate three representative jailbreak attackers spanning spectrum of adversarial prompting paradigms: (i) stochastic perturbations, (ii) learned adversarial suffix generation, and (iii) strategy-driven prompt rewriting. Text-augmentation (Hughes et al., 2024): Randomly change the letters or their capitalization in the prompt. ADV-LLM (Sun et al., 2025): Trained model that generates adversarial suffix against itself. Specifically, we use advllm llama3 (trained on Llama-3-8BInstrct (AI@Meta, 2024)). Jailbreak-R1 (Guo et al., 2025): Reasoning model trained with existing-strategies cold start, diversity warmup, and curriculum-based learning. Victims. We test all attackers against both openand closedsource models. For open-source victim models, we use Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024) (widely regarded as strongly safety-aligned). For closed-source evaluation, we use GPT-4.1-mini (OpenAI, 2024). Judges. Varied jailbreak judges have been applied in the literature. For comprehensiveness, we adopt two existing judges: LLM Classifier (Mazeika et al., 2024) and HarmBench Classifier (Mazeika et al., 2024). Baseline. We compare our estimators with naive baseline that uses observed SASR@1 (ˆθi) for each harmful query qi at small budget and compute large-N ASR under Best-of-N sampling by the following equation, (cid:92)(ASR@N )naive := 1 (cid:88) (1 i= (1 ˆθi)N ).

However, this estimator requires and is therefore not applicable in our low-budget regime where the target can greatly exceed the per-query measurement budget. (cid:1)/(cid:0) (cid:0) (1 See more details of experiment settings in Section C.1. 4.2. Experiment Results 4.2.1. MAIN RESULTS We first consider the most straightforward case, the evenbudget setting, where each harmful query qi is tested with the same small measurement budget (i.e., ni n). This controlled regime isolates the core extrapolation challenge: predicting ASR@N for large from limited, evenly collected per-query attempts. Unless otherwise specified, we use SABER-Anchored (Equation (12)) in this subsection. Predicting ASR at large-N . Table 1 reports ground-truth ASR@1000 together with estimates obtained from = 100 trials per query across attackervictimjudge combinations. Our anchored estimator reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 12.04 to 1.66, resulting in an 86.2% relative error reduction over the baseline. The gap is most pronounced in mid-range regimes where ASR@1000 is high but not saturated. For example, under ADV-LLM against GPT-4.1-mini with the HarmBench classifier, the ground truth is 75.16, 6 the baseline predicts 63.4, whereas our estimate is 74.28. Under Text Augmentation against GPT-4.1-mini, the ground truth is 92.62 (HarmBench classifier). The baseline drops to 77.23, while our anchored estimates recover 89.44. Estimation error across budget settings. To summarize performance more broadly, we report mean absolute error (MAE) for estimating ASR@N at different target and budgets in Figure 4. As shown in panel (a), increasing the measurement budget reduces estimation error for both methods, e.g., at = 1000, increasing the budget from = 50 to = 200 reduces baseline MAE from 14.1 to 5.5 and our anchored estimators MAE from 2.3 to 1.3. Panel (b) illustrates that extrapolating to larger is inherently harder. At fixed = 100, baseline MAE increases from 7.8 (N = 500) to 9.4 (N = 1000), while our method remains stable at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively. Panel (c) compare the three variants of SABER, demonstrating the outperformance of SABER-Anchored across different settings. Moreover, panel (a) and panel (b) confirm that our anchored estimator consistently achieves 4-6 lower MAE than the baseline across all settings. Particularly, the more challenging regime, that is, smaller and larger , the larger the gain. Small-N prediction from very small budgets. While our primary focus is on large-N risk, accurate prediction at small targets can be equally important, especially during many early-saturation situations in practice. That is, for strong attackers, weaker victims, or merely loose judges, ASR@N can already be high at modest budgets (e.g., 20, 50 ), and further increasing mainly yields marginal { } gains toward 100%. This motivates predicting ASR@N for small using even smaller measurement budgets n. We indeed observe this early-saturation behavior in multiple triplets, including ADV-LLM against Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct under the LLM Classifier, and Jailbreak-R1 against GPT-4.1mini under the HarmBench Classifier.

Even in this regime, SABER remains accurate and stable. For example, on the (Jailbreak-R1, GPT-4.1-mini, HarmBench Classifier) triplet, with only = 10 attempts per query, our method predicts ASR@50 within 0.25% error, whereas the baseline incurs 22.73% error (roughly 90 larger). This gap highlights practically relevant setting in which the budget is tightly constrained, yet quantitative risk assessment at modest remains necessary. Finally, when both and are very small, applying the corrected expression discussed in Section 3.4 further improves accuracy. As shown in Figure 5, SABER-Anchored already achieves substantially lower MAE than the baseline, and the correction provides an additional gain. For instance, there is 0.6% MAE improvement at = 10, = 20 and 0.1% at = 20, = 50, averaged across jailbreak triplets. As and increase, Figure 5. Small-N MAE averaged across all triplets on HarmBench. 7 We next test on two additional settings that relax the controlled assumptions of the main results and better reflect practical constraints: (i) unevenly distributed per-query budgets, and (ii) limited access to the full data pool. Unevenly distributed Budgets. In many realistic measurement pipelines, the attempt budget varies across harmful queries, due to logging constraints, adaptive allocation, or heterogeneous user traffic. To simulate this situation, we consider that the budget for each sample is uniformly distributed between 1 and 2n, ni QH , where is pre-defined level of average budget. U{ 1, 2n qi } , Panel (a) in Figure 6 shows that, on the same average budget n, MAE under uneven setting is systematically higher than under ni n. This effect is expected, since uneven ni induces heterogeneous measurement noise across queries and weakens the effective information for fitting the SASR distribution Beta(α, β). Panel (b) further highlights regime shift in which SABER-Plugin becomes preferable to SABER-Anchored. When the target and budget is not large (e.g., = 50, = 200), the plug-in estimator yields 0.8 lower MAE than anchoring, while has 0.2 higher MAE in the large-N regime. In Table 3, we report the prediction from the baseline and SABER-Plugin at = 50 and = 200 on GPT-4.1-mini as the victim model, which mirrors potential scenario where online service provider estimates adversarial risk from organically collected uneven user data. As shown, SABER-Plugin remains accurate and continues to substantially outperform the baseline with at least 7.32% less error, demonstrating effectiveness even when the data collection process departs from equal distribution.

We provide more discussions in Section C.2.3. 4.2.3. PREDICTING FOR TARGET ASR LEVEL 5. Conclusion In real-world settings, red-team operator may ask how many parallel samples are needed to attain 90% jailbreak coverage, or model developer may seek budgetnormalized measure of safety. Consequently, reversed question arises: how many attempts are required to reach target level of adversarial risk? Beyond estimating ASR@N at an fixed budget, our method also supports this inverse query. By Theorem 3.3, for target level τ τ )Γ(β)))1/α. Replacing (α, β) by the (Γ(α + β)/((1 BetaBinomial MLE (ˆα, ˆβ) yields direct plug-in estimator of Nτ . Similar to SABER-Anchored, we consider (0, 1), the required budget satisfies Nτ We present SABER, statistical framework for predicting large-scale adversarial risk in LLMs under Best-of-N sampling from small-budget measurements. Our key insight is that the scaling behavior of attack success rates is governed by the per-sample vulnerability distribution, which we model as Beta distribution. This leads an analytic scaling law enabling reliable extrapolation. Our results carry important implications for LLM safety evaluation. We demonstrated that models appearing robust under single-shot evaluation can exhibit rapid risk amplification at scale and the attack approach ranking can reverse depending the sampling budget. These findings highlight the need for scaling-aware safety evaluation beyond ASR@1.

Proof of Theorem 3.3. Under Theorem 3.2, for each query qi we have latent per-attempt success probability θi, and conditional on θi the attempt outcomes are i.i.d. Bernoulli(θi). Let (N )(qi) denote the OR-aggregated success indicator for qi under attempts. Then ASR@N = EqiQH [X (N )(qi)] and hence Since θi Beta(α, β) under the assumption, applying Theorem 3.1 gives the exact identity 1 ASR@N = EqiQH [ (N )(qi)]. ASR@N = 1 Γ(α + β) Γ(β) Γ(β + ) Γ(α + β + ) . (31) (32) Moreover, by Theorem B.1 (equivalently, by the second line of Equation (6)), we have the refined asymptotic expansion ASR@N 1 Γ(α + β) Γ(β) (cid:20) α α(α + 2β 2N 1) + (cid:0)N 2(cid:1) (cid:21) , .

UNBREAKABLE-SAMPLE MODELING EXTENSION Beta(α, β), the latent per-attempt success probability has continuous support on Under the Beta-mixture assumption θi (0, 1), and thus Pr(θi = 0) = 0. Consequently, for any fixed query qi we have Pr(cid:0)X (N )(qi) = 1 1 as 1. In practice, however, some harmful queries may be deterministically unbreakable under given attackervictimjudge pipeline (e.g., due to hard refusals, safety filters, or constrained decoding), which corresponds to non-negligible probability mass at θi = 0. , and averaging over queries implies ASR@N (cid:1) = 1 θi)N (1 θi simple way to capture such unbreakable queries is spike-and-slab prior, θi πδ0 + (1 π)Beta(α, β), where δ0 is point mass at 0 and π [0, 1] is the fraction of unbreakable queries. Then ASR@N = 1 E(cid:2)(1 θ)N (cid:3) π 1 (N ), so the risk saturates below 1 at level determined by π. In this case, our scaling law becomes ASR@N = (1 (cid:18) π) 1 Γ(α + β) Γ(β) (cid:19) . α When considering there exist always-success samples, similar extension can be applied. B.1.3. BENIGN-ATTEMPTS EXTENSION FOR ONLINE RISK ESTIMATION (34) (35) (36) In more realistic online setting, we can consider that streaming prompt is harmful with probability ph and benign with probability 1 . For benign prompts, we assume the judge always outputs not jailbroken, i.e., s(qbenign) streamed prompts, we are interested in estimating the probability of observing at least one jailbreaking event, ph. For harmful prompts, judge determines whether the victim LLM is jailbroken, i.e., s(qharm) 0, 1 } 0. Given total budget of { where s(N ) indicates whether there exists at least one successful jailbreak among the prompts. Assuming again the Beta distribution Beta(α, β) of the sample-level success probability, we consider two cases. Pr(cid:0)s(N ) = 1(cid:1), (37) Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 Case 1: i.i.d. harmful prompts. First consider general scenario where each harmful prompt is generated independently by attacking randomly sampled harmful query. Under this full independence (random harmful query and randomly generated adversarial prompt), each prompt has an identical unconditional success probability θ := E[θi] = α α+β . Therefore, Pr(cid:0)s(N ) = 1 α, β(cid:1) = 1 (1 θ)N = 1 (cid:18) β (cid:19)N α + β . (38) Case 2: repeated attempts on one sampled harmful query. As special case, suppose that within fixed period the attacker repeatedly queries adversarial prompts targeting single harmful query. Let nh denote the number of harmful Binomial(N, ph).

Density of ˆα, ˆβ on different K. GT denotes ground-truth. Behavior of variance under varying and K. Since I(α, β) scales linearly with K, the asymptotic covariance shrinks as 1 = O(1/K), holding the per-query budget fixed. Moreover, increasing strengthens each querys contribution by making more informative about θ, which increases the Fisher information and reduces estimator variance. We visualize this behavior using both (i) the numerical evaluation of the close-formed I(ω)1 and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation under varying (n, K). First, Figure 7 plots the empirical sampling distribution of (ˆα, ˆβ) under varying K. In contrast to the distribution plot that varies in Figure 3, increasing continuously narrows the distribution. In particular, there is clear difference between the distributions of = 500 and = 1000, consistent with the closed-form scaling Var(ˆα), Var( ˆβ) 1. 17 Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 Figure 8. Std of ˆα, ˆβ on different K. Figure 9. Std of ˆα, ˆβ on different K. Second, Figure 9 plot Std(ˆα) and Std( ˆβ) as functions of K, computed from both (i) the numerical evaluation of the closed-form asymptotic covariance I(ω)1 in Equation (87) and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation. These plots further confirm the inverse-K variance scaling: increasing always decreases the variance at 1 rate. Finally, as shown in Figure 8 when the per-query budget is very large, the decrease of Std(ˆα) and Std( ˆβ) as function of becomes slower, compared to the effect of increasing K. Notably, across moderate-to-large K, the consistency between the numerically computed values and the Monte Carlo estimates supports the correctness of our closed-form expression. When is small, the discrepancy between them is expected because the asymptotic normality approximation underlying I(ω)1 is no longer accurate. Confidence intervals for (cid:91)ASR@N . Given (cid:100)Cov(ˆω), one can obtain (i) delta-method interval for the plug-in estimator in Equation (11), or (ii) the simpler transformation-based interval for the anchored estimator in Equation (14) (which depends only on ˆα).

Importantly, even for failing triplets, SABERs MAE remains competitive  (Table 1)  , suggesting practical robustness beyond strict distributional assumptions. 0 or ˆθi C.2.2. BUDGET ALLOCATION In this subsection, we consider how to allocate our budget if we have fixed and limited total budget nK, where is the average number of trials per harmful query and is the number of queries (data size). Our goal is to choose (n, K) to minimize the estimation uncertainty of (cid:91)ASR@N , which in our framework is induced by the uncertainty of the BetaBinomial MLE (ˆα, ˆβ). Closed-form scaling. Recall the closed-form asymptotic covariance of (ˆα, ˆβ) in Equation (87): Var(ˆα) = (cid:2)I(α, β)1(cid:3) and Var( ˆβ) = (cid:2)I(α, β)1(cid:3) further fix the total budget := nK, then (for ˆα) we can rewrite 11 22. Since I(α, β) scales linearly with K, both variances scale as O(1/K) when is fixed. If we Var( ˆα) = = = (cid:16) ψ(β) ψ(α + β) + ψ(n + α + β) E(cid:0)ψ(n + β)(cid:1)(cid:17) ψ(β) ψ(α + β) + ψ(n + α + β) E(cid:0)ψ(n + β)(cid:1)(cid:17) (cid:16) 1 Kf (α, β, n) Bf (α, β, n) 1 gα(α, β, n), where gα(α, β, n) := (cid:16) (α, β, n) ψ(β) ψ(α + β) + ψ(n + α + β) E(cid:0)ψ(n + β)(cid:1)(cid:17) . (88) (89) (90) (91) An analogous expression holds for Var( ˆβ) = 1 gβ(α, β, n). Therefore, under fixed B, optimizing the variance over (n, K) reduces to selecting that minimizes gα (or gβ), and then setting = B/n. In particular, if gα(α, β, n) admits minimizer at some finite > 0, then (once is large enough to allow = B/n queries) the optimal is independent of B, and the optimal scales proportionally with B. 21 Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 Figure 10. Std of ˆα, ˆβ with fixed total budget nK. GT denotes ground-truth. Table 6. Average MAE across all jailbreak pipeline on fixed total budget nK. Empirical validation. We validate this trade-off by comparing (i) the closed-form prediction from Equation (87) and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation. We set the groundtruth (α, β) = (0.4, 4), fix the total budget = nK = 10000, and vary (hence = 10000/n). Figure 10 plots the resulting standard deviations of ˆα and ˆβ. We find that the standard deviation of ˆα is minimized around = 10 (i.e., = 1000), while for ˆβ the best allocation is around = 5. Overall, these results suggest that one does not need large per-query budget as long as enough queries are available: moderate with large can yield the most stable estimates. This is also consistent with the empirical behavior observed in Table 6: when the total 800 queries) gives the best performance among the tested 8000), allocating = 10 per query (hence budget is small ( choices, indicating that moderate per-query trials can be optimal when we can collect enough queries. In contrast, when the dataset size is capped (e.g., HarmBench has only = 159 queries), we cannot increase further; under fixed total budget, the best strategy is then to spend the remaining budget on larger and use all available queries.

The inverse form motivates simple evaluation metric that is directly aligned with operational threat models: Budget@τ , defined as the predicted number of attempts needed to reach ASR@N = τ (e.g., Budget@90%). Unlike ASR@1, this metric explicitly captures scaling behavior: two attackers with similar single-shot ASR can induce dramatically different required budgets if their ˆα differs. From benchmarking perspective, Budget@τ offers two advantages. First, it is interpretable: it answers how many parallel attempts are needed to succeed on τ fraction of harmful queries? Second, it is cost-aware: one can report Budget@τ using only small-budget measurements by fitting ˆα (and optionally anchoring at ASR@n), avoiding brute-force evaluation at very large . D. Limitation and Future Work Beyond binary judges. Our formulation assumes binary judge output , which simplifies the analysis by reducing each attempt to Bernoulli trial. In practice, judges may return scores or multi-class assessment instead (e.g., multiple severity levels). natural extension is to replace the Bernoulli-Beta hierarchy with categorical likelihood and Dirichlet prior, enabling scaling-aware estimator for non-binary outcomes and providing more fine-grained evaluation. { 0, 1 } Broader task coverage and stronger pipelines. Our empirical evaluation focuses on single textual jailbreak benchmark, HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024). Additionally, although we choose attackers span three major paradigms to show our generality, they are not necessarily the most advanced available. Similarly, due to budget constraints, we do not evaluate the most costly frontier safety-aligned models (e.g., GPT-5.2). Future work should test SABER on broader settings, including multi-modal jailbreak tasks and larger datasets such as AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), as well as wider range of state-of-the-art attackers and victims. Understanding and correcting systematic bias. Empirically, the remaining error of SABER tends to arise more from underestimating ASR@N than from overestimating it. promising direction is to investigate the sources of this bias and develop principled amendments that improve calibration while preserving the extrapolation guarantees."
