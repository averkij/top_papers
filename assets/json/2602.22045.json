            "title": "1 Introduction\nThe DLT field lacks a comprehensive text corpus. While, at the\ntime of this writing, the ecosystem has grown to ∼$3 trillion in\nmarket capitalization [15] and introduced new concepts such as\nstablecoins, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), and Automated Mar-\nket Makers (AMMs) [36], NLP research within the DLT domain\nremains constrained by narrow, task-specific datasets that overlook\nsubstantial textual resources in scientific publications, patents, and\ntechnical documentation.",
            "content": "Current DLT datasets focus primarily on cryptocurrency price prediction [31, 53, 68], trading [23, 47, 52, 53], and smart contracts [19, 43, 72, 83]. These resources support specific NLP downstream tasks, such as NER [36], Question Answering (QA) [67], sentiment analysis [5, 65], but fail to capture the substantial textual resources available in scientific literature, patent filings, and technical documentation. This gap limits the development of practical NLP applications: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that reduce Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations [67], patent landscape monitoring, protocol documentation analysis, and technology trend detection, to cite few examples. Similarly, [2, 11, 29, 41, 46, 58, 78] demonstrate that small language models trained on domain-specific corpora outperform general-purpose LLMs on specialized tasks while remaining computationally efficient [11, 41, 46, 78], highlighting the need for comprehensive DLT text resources. We introduce DLT-Corpus1, the largest domain-specific text collection for DLT research: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning open-access scientific literature2, USPTO patent filings3, and Twitter/X posts4 collected before 2023 platform restrictions [21]. This corpus integrates technical specifications, economic mechanisms, community discourse, and governance frameworks, providing foundation for NLP systems tailored to the DLT domain. We demonstrate the corpus utility through two analyses. First, we track how technologies diffuse from scientific literature to patents to social media, finding that concepts such as stablecoins, AMMs, and DEXs consistently originate in research before reaching commercial and consumer communities. Second, we examine correlations between market dynamics and innovation activity, finding that scientific publications lead market expansion by two years (𝜌 = 0.95, 𝑝 < 0.001), while social media sentiment remains bullish (i.e., extremely optimistic) even during crypto winters. In summary, our contributions are: DLT-Corpus5: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents (37,440 scientific publications, 49,023 patents, 22M social media posts) with rich metadata enabling cross-disciplinary research.

            "content": "Existing DLT text resources are fragmented and narrow. The DLT domain combines technical specifications [8, 16, 55], economic mechanisms [13, 50, 54], and social dynamics [20, 36], with rapid terminological evolution introducing concepts like AMMs, DEXs, stablecoins, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Yet existing datasets focus narrowly on cryptocurrency markets: price prediction [31, 45, 53, 68], trading [47, 57], fraud detection [24, 48], and sentiment analysis [5, 30, 65]. These datasets primarily extract social media content from Twitter/X, Telegram, and Reddit [42, 45, 68], but despite some studies collecting millions of tweets, this data is rarely publicly available. Other work relies on transactional data [25, 72] and smart contracts [19, 43, 83], overlooking textual resources in scientific publications, patents, and technical documentation. General-purpose corpora such as RefinedWeb [59], CommonCrawl, and C4 [63] contain some cryptocurrency content but lack domain specificity. DLT-Corpus addresses this gap by integrating scientific literature, USPTO patents, and Twitter/X data collected before 2023 API restrictions [21], enabling both crossdomain analysis and domain-specific NLP applications. Innovation diffusion in DLT lacks integrated analysis. Prior work on DLT domain analysis remains fragmented: NER applied to scientific literature [36] or patents [82], news-based studies [60], taxonomies [9, 73], and systematic reviews [28, 81]. Our work provides the first integrated analysis spanning scientific publications, patents, and community discourse (6), revealing how innovation emerges and diffuses across research, commercial, and user communities.

We retrieved PDFs and metadata (authors, title, year, venue, references, licensing)12 from Semantic Scholar13 using domainspecific queries (e.g., Distributed Ledger Technology, Blockchain, Hashgraph, DAG, Consensus Mechanisms, Distributed Computing, Distributed Storage, Distributed Databases), producing 144,843 initial documents. Processing. We parsed PDFs to Markdown using PyMuPDF4LLM,14 filtered for English-only content using FastText [40], and removed outliers that were either too short (< 500 tokens) or too long (> 40k tokens), retaining 112,911 documents. Domain filtering. To ensure relevance, we fine-tuned BERT-basecased15 on the NER dataset from [36] and predicted domain-specific entities in each document. We filtered documents based on prediction quality by calculating: (1) the number of predicted entities per document, (2) the maximum prediction score, and (3) the median prediction score across all entities. Documents were retained if they had maximum prediction score above 0.995 or median prediction score at or above the scientific literature subset-wide median, ensuring high confidence in domain-specific content while maintaining reasonable coverage. This filtering step, combined with duplicate removal, reduced the dataset to 38,010 documents. Then, manual review remove 570 marginally relevant papers, obtaining 37,440 publications. The removed papers were false positives retrieved because terms like distributed, consensus, protocol, and network appear in non-DLT contexts. Manual inspection revealed these papers clustered around biomedical domains: Alzheimers disease research (neurofibrillary tangles, tau proteins, amyloid, dementia), infectious disease epidemiology (COVID-19, tuberculosis), oncology, and healthcare systems because they share terminology with DLT but focus on distributed biological processes, clinical consensus protocols, or decentralized healthcare delivery rather than Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

Jensen-Shannon divergence between DLT-Corpus and general corpora ranges from 0.39 to 0.45, while divergence between RefinedWeb and C4 is only 0.10. This difference confirms that DLT-Corpus has fundamentally distinct vocabulary distributions from general web text. Higher keyword density matters for language model learning because language models rely on word frequency during training to acquire vocabulary [18]. Domain-adaptive pretraining on corpora with concentrated terminology exposure leads to performance gains on downstream tasks [32], as models encounter domain-specific terms more frequently and learn their contextual usage patterns [18]. The 8.7 higher density in DLT-Corpus compared to general web text provides substantially more learning signal per token for DLT terminology."

We quantify these relationships using Spearmans rank correlation. Table 4 reports Spearmans rank correlations between annual market capitalization and document volumes (20132023 for social media, 20132024 for patents and publications).33 All three document types show strong positive correlations: scientific literature (𝜌 = 0.76, 𝑝 < 0.004), patents (𝜌 = 0.96, 𝑝 < 0.001), and social media (𝜌 = 0.98, 𝑝 < 0.001). Lagged correlations reveal temporal structure. To test whether research drives market expansion or responds to it, we compute lagged correlations  (Table 5)  . The scientific literature subset spans 19782025 (earliest: [66]), enabling meaningful lag analysis. 30For example, see ongoing copyright lawsuits by news organizations against OpenAI [14, 61] and Microsoft [61] over alleged copyright violations of news articles, which motivated this exclusion. 31https://huggingface.co/ExponentialScience/LedgerBERT-Market-Sentiment 32Median market capitalization per year of the cryptocurrency market using aggregated data from CoinGecko. 33Systematic market data became available around 2013 as cryptocurrencies developed sufficient liquidity [55].

(a) Stablecoins (b) DEX (c) AMM Figure 3: Mentions per year for selected technologies in the DLT-Corpus. The y-axis represents the relative frequency of mentions normalized by the total volume of documents in each source per year. Scientific publications show asymmetric temporal patterns: correlations remain strong when publications lead the market (negative lags), but decay rapidly when the market leads publications and losing significance beyond two years (𝜌 = 0.47, 𝑝 = 0.21 at three years). This asymmetry indicates research precedes market expansion. Social media exhibits the opposite pattern: strongest correlations when the market leads by three years (𝜌 = 0.97, 𝑝 < 0.001), weaker when social media leads (𝜌 = 0.77, 𝑝 = 0.07 at five years). Patents show symmetric patterns with peak concurrent correlation (𝜌 = 0.98, 𝑝 < 0.001), significant whether patents lead (𝜌 = 0.95, 𝑝 < 0.001 at three years) or lag (𝜌 = 0.86, 𝑝 = 0.007 at three years). Additionally, the three corpus subsets reflect distinct communities with different incentives: researchers seeking knowledge dissemination (scientific literature), industry practitioners protecting commercial innovations (patents), and users engaging with the market (social media). Therefore, at more granular level, considering the incentives that the three audiences reflected in the DLT-Corpus have, we investigate two fundamental questions about innovation dynamics in the DLT ecosystem: (1) Where do technological concepts originate, and how do they diffuse across communities? (2) How does market sentiment relate to research and commercial innovation activity? These analyses provide insights into the relationship between public discourse, scientific inquiry, and commercial innovation in the DLT domain. Most importantly, these analyses serve as introductory demonstrations of use cases for the type of analyses that can be carried out with the DLT-Corpus."

We focus on three economically significant technologies: (1) stablecoins, given recent regulatory frameworks (US GENIUS Act,34 Europes MiCAR35) and their role bridging traditional and decentralized finance [37, 49]. (2) DEXs, holding approximately $174B in Total Value Locked (TVL)36. (3) AMMs, the mechanism enabling decentralized token swapping [35, 80]. Findings. Stablecoins (Fig. 2a), AMMs (Fig. 2c), and DEXs (Fig. 2b) consistently originate in scientific literature, with researchers maintaining sustained interest over time. This pattern aligns with traditional technology transfer models where research precedes commercial application and consumer adoption [3, 4]. Cryptocurrency mentions vs. technology mentions. We contrast technology diffusion with cryptocurrency mentions to distinguish innovation interest from speculative interest. We analyze Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP because they represent the three largest nonstablecoins by market capitalization37). We include Hedera because it uses Hashgraph [8], which differs from the blockchain architecture used by most cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, Hedera is the only non-blockchain DLT in the top 20 by market capitalization. Bitcoin (Fig. 4a) shows high user interest but declining patents and plateauing publications representing characteristics of mature consumer asset. Ethereum (Fig. 4b) exhibits growing publications and patents alongside user interest, reflecting continued innovation through smart contracts and DeFi.38 Similar to Ethereum, Hedera (Fig. 4d) attracts primarily academic interest with limited user engagement, consistent with early-stage technology transfer. XRP (Fig. 4c) shows sharply declining user engagement around 2020, which coincides with major lawsuit in the United States (US) involving this digital asset [71]. Interestingly, patents and academic and industry research continue growing for XRP before plateauing and slowly picking up again. The contrast between cryptocurrency mentions  (Fig. 4)  and technology mentions  (Fig. 3)  reveals the speculative focus of users on digital assets while researchers and industry practitioners focus on technologies. Then, this raises the question: to what degree does market sentiment affect researchers? 34https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/394/text 35https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/mar kets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica 36https://defillama.com/ 37https://coinmarketcap.com/ 38https://defillama.com/chains DLT-Corpus: Large-Scale Text Collection for the Distributed Ledger Technology Domain (a) Bitcoin (b) Ethereum (c) XRP (d) Hedera Figure 4: Proportion of mentions per year for selected cryptocurrencies in the DLT-Corpus.

We classified social media posts according to market sentiment (bullish, bearish, or neutral), using the finetuned LedgerBERT (5, 4.2), and aggregated them over yearly intervals. Findings. We observe that even during periods of crypto winter (e.g., 2018 to 201939,40), the user community is overwhelmingly bullish  (Fig. 5)  . Additionally, bearish sentiment peaks in 2022 while 2023 shows bullish sentiment rapidly growing as the market recovers. Comparing Fig. 1d with Fig. 5 reveals that patents and scientific publications follow trajectories largely independent of short-term market sentiment. Instead, innovation activity grows alongside the overall market expansion (6.1)."

            "content": "Divergent community interests. The community of users seems to focus on cryptocurrencies as investments, while researchers appear to concentrate on underlying technologies. New Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and concepts first appear in the scientific literature before spreading to patents and the user community (6.1), following traditional technology transfer model [3, 4]. This pattern suggests that engaging with recently published scientific literature can help identify emerging technologies in the DLT field before they become mainstream, potentially creating opportunities for early commercial innovation. Cryptocurrencies trajectory diverge. Analysis of specific cryptocurrencies reveals how different factors shape their evolution 39https://www.kraken.com/learn/crypto-bull-bear-markets 40https://finance.yahoo.com/news/contrasting-2022-market-crash-2018174800300.html Figure 5: Market sentiment in social media and yearly growth of global cryptocurrency market capitalization. across communities  (Fig. 4)  . Bitcoin shows declining patent activity and plateauing scientific publications despite sustained interest from the user community, suggesting it is maturing into consumerfocused digital asset. Ethereum exhibits different pattern, with growing academic publications and patents alongside user interest, reflecting its continued role in driving innovation through smart contracts and DeFi applications. XRP shows how external events shape community behavior. For example, XRPs user engagement dropped sharply around 2020 during its legal challenges [71], while research activity continued. Hedera attracts primarily academic interest and limited user engagement, suggesting that new DLT architectures, like Hashgraph [8] powering Hedera, can sustain scientific interest without immediate market enthusiasm. However, given that the DLT-Corpus indicates the DLT field may follow traditional technology transfer model, Hedera may be in the early stages, with mainstream popularity among users coming later. These patterns show that technology innovation, regulation, and market speculation each shape the DLT ecosystem independently. Research creates economic value through virtuous cycle. 6 suggests that research establishes the foundation for the DLT field [36] that precedes market expansion, while commercial innovation and community discourse respond strongly to market conditions. Then, as cryptocurrency markets grew, increased capital likely funded industry research, leading to more patent filings and heightened community engagement. This creates virtuous cycle in which foundational research generates innovations that commercial actors and the broader community adopt, develop, and speculate on during periods of market growth, thereby channeling more funding into future research. This pattern benefits the DLT field by maintaining stable research foundation while market-driven activity accelerates technology adoption and deployment."

Although we manually revised the filtered scientific literature subset, removing 570 papers (4.1.1), there is still possibility that marginally relevant DLT papers may remain in the dataset. Data accessibility and legal compliance trade-offs. We prioritize data accessibility and legal compliance (see 10) in constructing the DLT-Corpus, which may limit subset sizes and collection from other types of data sources, like news (5.2), but reduces legal barriers for academic and commercial use of the DLT-Corpus. This emphasis addresses growing industry concerns about regulatory and copyright risks in Artificial Intelligence (AI) development. S&P 500 companies have acknowledged in hundreds of corporate filings and executive transcripts that legal and regulatory risks are primary concerns in their AI adoption [34], which is likely amplified by ongoing copyright lawsuits against OpenAI [14, 61], Microsoft [61], Anthropic [39], and Meta [44] over alleged copyright violations from data collected and used for training their LLMs. 41https://huggingface.co/collections/ExponentialScience/dlt-corpus68e44e40d4e7a3bd7a224402 42https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Sentiment-News 43https://www.statista.com/statistics/262946/most-common-languages-on-theinternet/ Hernandez Cruz et al."

Unsuitable Uses: Identification of specific individuals, creating investment advice systems without proper disclaimers, and applications requiring post-2023 social media data. Impact: May enable market manipulation if misused. Researchers should implement appropriate safeguards. Distribution Access: https://huggingface.co/collections/ExponentialScience/dltcorpus-68e44e40d4e7a3bd7a224402 License: Scientific literature: Mixed open-access licenses (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC0, and other permissive licenses). Individual license information is included in metadata where available. Patents: Public domain under USPTOs T&Cs. Patent text is typically not subject to copyright restrictions per USPTOs T&Cs56. Social media: Released under CC-BY-NC 4.0 for research purposes. Collected before changes in Twitter / Xs T&Cs in 202357,58, permitting academic research use [21]. Maintenance Updates: Currently static snapshot. Future versions may expand scientific literature and patents, but would likely not include post2023 social media. A.2 Sentiment Analysis Dataset Motivation Purpose: The DLT Sentiment Analysis Dataset59 was created to support sentiment analysis research in the DLT domain, addressing the lack of high-quality labeled data that captures domain-specific sentiment expressed by cryptocurrency community members. Creators: Walter Hernandez Cruz, Peter Devine, Nikhil Vadgama, Paolo Tasca, Jiahua Xu Composition Content: 23,301 examples with 1.85M tokens (average 79.51 tokens per example). Labels: Three sentiment dimensions with three categories each: Market direction: bullish, bearish, neutral Content quality: important, lol, neutral Engagement: liked, disliked, neutral Temporal Coverage: January 2021 to May 2025 Language: English Missing Data: None. Confidentiality: No private or confidential data. All content derived from publicly available cryptocurrency news articles headlines (and brief descriptions) voted on by CryptoPanic users. 56https://www.uspto.gov/terms-use-uspto-websites 57https://x.com/en/tos/previous/version_18 58https://x.com/en/tos/previous/version_17 59https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Sentiment-News Hernandez Cruz et al.

Collection Source: CryptoPanic platform, where cryptocurrency community users vote on news articles headlines and their brief descriptions across multiple sentiment categories. Annotation Method: Crowdsourced voting by active cryptocurrency users, providing domain expertise. Vote percentages normalized by total engagement, filtered using median minimum votes, with 25th and 75th percentiles as classification boundaries (4.2). Preprocessing Label Assignment: Percentile-based classification to mitigate popularity bias. Articles below the 25th percentile are labeled negative, above the 75th percentile are labeled positive, and those between are labeled neutral for each dimension (see 4.2 for more details). Quality Control: Minimum vote threshold applied to exclude articles with insufficient community engagement (4.2). Uses Intended Use: Sentiment analysis research, domain-specific model evaluation, market sentiment studies in DLT domain. Unsuitable Uses: Investment decision systems without proper disclaimers, identifying individual voters, and applications requiring real-time sentiment. Impact: May enable market manipulation if misused. Researchers should implement appropriate safeguards and ethical guidelines. Distribution Access: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLTSentiment-News License: CC-BY-NC 4.0 for research purposes. Derived from publicly available CryptoPanic data with crowdsourced community annotations. Data collected via CryptoPanics free API between March and May 2025. To the best of our knowledge, the T&Cs at the time of collection (cryptopanic.com/terms/) contained no restrictions on academic research use or redistribution. Maintenance Updates: Currently static snapshot. Future versions may expand temporal coverage or add additional sentiment dimensions."
