            "content": "Recent advances in language models have expanded their applications in materials science (Pilania, 2021; Olivetti et al., 2020). However, typical language models for materials science utilize frequency-centric subword tokenization methods originally developed for general natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Trewartha et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022; Huang and Cole, 2022). These methods prioritize high-frequency words in tokenization, resulting in misrepresentation of lowfrequency words (Yuan et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2023), which is particularly problematic in material corpora. 1Our code is available at https://github.com/ yerimoh/MATTER Figure 1: (a) Frequency histograms of material concepts and general words on 150K materials-related scientific papers. (b) Tokenization results of material concepts using conventional tokenization and MATTER (ours). Material conceptssuch as material names and chemical formulastend to appear infrequently in materials-related scientific papers as shown in Figure 1(a). This can lead to the oversight of material concepts in frequency-centric tokenization methods, whereas high-frequency general words dominate the subword vocabulary. As result, material concepts are indeed fragmented into semantically unrelated subwords. For example, as shown in Figure 1(b), the word germanium , which means chemical element, is split into semantically unrelated subwords german and -ium. Such fragmentation may cause language models to misinterpret the meaning of material concepts, resulting in performance degradation in materials science tasks. Several previous studies have also shown that preserving domain-specific subwords is crucial for maintaining model effectiveness (Guti√©rrez et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2021; Hofmann et al., 2021), but how to identify and preserve such words remains unexplored in the materials science domain. To address this issue, we propose MATTER (Materials Tokenization Framework), novel approach that integrates material knowledge into tokenization. MATTER involves carefully designed frequency computation and merging processes to effectively capture the material concepts. We present MatDetector, material concept identifier that scores each concept by its relevance to the materials domain, trained on corpus of material knowledge that we carefully constructed. Subsequently, jointly considering the relevance scores and statistics of words, MATTER re-ranks the score of multiple possible merged tokens, prioritizing material-related subwords to be preserved. By integrating material knowledge into frequency computation and restructuring token merging, MATTER addresses the limitations of standard frequencycentric tokenization and enhances the representation of material concepts. To verify the efficacy of MATTER, we conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks in materials science, including both generation and classification. The results demonstrate that MATTER significantly enhances performance on material-specific tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of material terminology. By integrating material knowledge into tokenization training, MATTER enables more precise learning of domain-specific concepts, underscoring the effectiveness of this tailored approach. In summary, this paper presents the following key contributions: We introduce MATTER, novel domainspecific tokenization framework that integrates material knowledge into the tokenization process. We develop novel scheme for materials tokenization based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge corpus integrated into our re-ranked token merging process. We demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing tokenization methods, achieving an average improvement of 4% on generation tasks and 2% on classification tasks through extensive experiments."

            "content": "2.1 Subword Tokenization Tokenization plays crucial role in the performance of language models (Rust et al., 2021; Singh and Strouse, 2024; Wang et al., 2024a). One significant advancement in this area is subword tokenization, pivotal approach in NLP. Various subword tokenization techniques exist, among which frequencycentric methods, such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE; Gage 1994; Sennrich et al. 2016) and WordPiece (Wu et al., 2016), construct subword vocabularies by merging frequently co-occurring character sequences. Recent studies have explored integrating additional linguistic and contextual signals into tokenization. SAGE (Yehezkel and Pinter, 2023) introduces contextual embeddings to guide token segmentation, while PickyBPE (Chizhov et al., 2024) refines intermediate junk tokens. However, while these methods effectively preserve high-frequency words, they often fragment low-frequency words, obscuring their meaning (Schmidt et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2016; Sennrich, 2015; Mikolov et al., 2012). Additionally, they are designed for general-domain corpora and fail to account for specialized terminology in the materials domain, where key concepts are both semantically significant and infrequent. As result, conventional tokenization methods frequently split material concepts into unrelated subwords, disrupting their meaning. In contrast, MATTER is designed to address these domain-specific challenges in materials science. 2.2 Language Models in Materials Science The discovery and practical application of materials is time-intensive process, often spanning decades (Science and , US; Jain et al., 2013). To accelerate this process, leveraging the wealth of knowledge captured in textual datasets has become essential. NLP-based approaches have potential in materials informatics, enabling advancements in extracting and utilizing domain-specific knowledge (Wang et al., 2024b; Friedrich et al., 2020; Weston et al., 2019; Mysore et al., 2019). Tshitoyan et al. (2019) introduced embedding-based unsupervised methods, effectively capturing chemical knowledge and understanding chemical properties. Building on this foundation, Trewartha et al. (2022) introduced pre-trained language models trained on materials science corpus, utilizing BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Further extending the capabilities of BERT-based models, SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019), trained on material and battery-specific corpora, was adapted into MatSciBERT (Gupta et al., 2022) and BatteryBERT (Huang and Cole, 2022), respectively. Figure 2: Comparison of the overall methodology between the existing frequency-centric tokenization and MATTER: (a) The existing frequency-centric tokenization creates the vocabularies based on word frequency. (b) In contrast, our approach, MATTER, incorporates material knowledge from MatDetector into subword vocabularies. However, these models rely on tokenization strategies originally designed for general NLP tasks, which can be suboptimal for material specialized terminology. In contrast, MATTER introduces tokenization approach tailored to the unique linguistic characteristics of the materials domain."

            "content": "We propose materials-aware tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into tokenization training and re-ranks token merging order. The overall procedure is illustrated in Figure 2. 3.1 Word Frequency Calculation MATTER incorporates the WordPiece algorithm, frequency-centric tokenization method, with material domain knowledge. The standard WordPiece algorithm first computes the frequency of each word in the corpus. Then, it tokenizes words into sequences of characters or byte units and iteratively merges the most frequent pair of tokens. Similarly, MATTER also computes word frequencies, denoted as freqorigin(w) for word w: freqorigin(w) = count(w) where count(w) represents the number of occurrences of word in the corpus. However, MATTER further incorporates material knowledge ( 3.2) and re-ranks the token merging order ( 3.3) to better preserve domain-specific terminology. 3.2 Material Knowledge Incorporation To integrate material knowledge into MATTER, we adjust word frequencies ( 3.1) by assigning weights to material concepts. Therefore, precise identification of material concepts is crucial. Traditionally, ChemDataExtractor (Kumar et al., 2024) has been widely used in materials science for this purpose, but since it was trained on biomedical data, its accuracy in identifying material concepts is limited (Kim et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024; Tran et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023). To address this, we introduce MatDetector, material-agnostic tool that detects material concepts in target corpus and assigns probability scores to each concept. Developed using the architecture of Trewartha et al. (2022), MatDetector is optimized for material concept detection. The dataset creation process is as follows: Material Concept Extraction The MatDetector searches the PubChem database (Kim et al., 2019) for material-related concepts, extracting 80K material concepts (chemical names, IUPAC names, synonyms, and molecular formulas). Material Corpus Crawling Using these concepts extracted from PubChem, we crawl Semantic Scholar, collecting around 42K scientific papers. Crawled Data Tagging The collected corpus is tagged with PubChem material concepts, creating NER material dataset with labels \"material name\", Re-ranking Unique characters if ÀÜymat(w) = then freqmat(w) freqorigin(w) + Œª {c C} freqorigin(w) word frequency for all ÀÜymat(w) D(w) for all do Algorithm 1 MATTER Tokenization Training Input: Corpus C, Vocabulary size , MatDetector D, Material importance factor Œª Output: Vocabulary of size (ordered) 1: procedure MATTER(C, V, D, Œª) 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: end procedure tL, tR arg max(tL,tR) MatScore(tL, tR) tnew tL tR {tnew} C.ReplaceAll(tL, tR, tnew) Recompute Score for updated token set end for Compute Score(tL, tR) for all token pairs while < do freqmat(w) freqorigin(w) end while return Create new token Update corpus Merge tokens ÀÜymat(w) 1ÀÜymat(w) end if else \"material formula\", and \"other\". Labels other than \"other\" are treated as \"material concept\". Data Augmentation While Semantic Scholar offers relatively clean data, material-related datasets from journals and repositories often contain formatting inconsistencies, OCR errors, and structural variations. To address this, we standardized common noise and expanded the dataset fourfold to enhance model robustness. Details in Appendix B. Using the MatDetector, we can detect material concepts and compute their probability. Specifically, for Given word that is split into subword tokens {t1, t2, ..., tn}, the label for the word is determined as follows: ÀÜy(w) = arg max cC 1 (cid:88) i=1 (ti, c) (1) where is the set of all possible labels, and (ti, c) denotes the probability of subword token ti being classified as label c. If the predicted label ÀÜy(w) falls under \"material concept,\" we denote it as ÀÜymat(w). The equation is as follows: ÀÜymat(w) = (cid:40) ÀÜy(w), , if ÀÜy(w) {material} otherwise (2) Ultimately, material concepts identified within the vocabulary are assigned ÀÜymat(w), representing the likelihood of word being relevant to the material domain. higher probability value indicates stronger relevance to material concepts, ensuring that domain-specific concepts are effectively distinguished from general words. 3.3 Vocab Creation with Re-ranked Order To integrate ÀÜymat(w) into tokenization, we adjust word frequency computations by weighting material concepts based on their assigned probability scores. This adjustment prevents material concepts from being underrepresented, preserving their structural and semantic integrity during tokenization. To incorporate material information, we assign weighted frequencies to material concepts as follows: Using this ÀÜymat(w), MATTER adjusts the original frequency to prioritize material concepts. The adjusted frequency is computed as follows: freqmat(w) = freqorigin(w) + Œª ÀÜymat(w) 1 ÀÜymat(w) (3) With the adjusted frequency incorporating material knowledge, MATTER re-ranks the merging order based on incorporated material knowledge. Words are initially decomposed into sequences of characters or byte units, and the algorithm iteratively merges token pairs according to the re-ranked order guided by material relevance. The detailed algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1."

All training conditionsincluding model architecture, optimizer, and learning rateare held constant across tokenizers to ensure fair comparison. In MATTER, the weighting parameter Œª was set to 1 based on empirical analysis (see 4.6), and further implementation details are provided in Appendix A.2. Downstream Tasks and Datasets To comprehensively evaluate the performance of MATTER, we compare models trained with different tokenization methods on both generation and classification tasks. For generation tasks, we assess each baseline on the MatSci-NLP dataset (Song et al., 2023a), which includes seven materials-related tasks. We follow the MatSci-NLP benchmark protocol, which evaluates domain-specific encoders using transformer-based schema decoder tailored for generation-based tasks. For classification tasks, we adopt four distinct benchmarks from prior work (Gupta et al., 2022), including named entity recognition (Weston et al., 2019; Friedrich et al., 2020), paragraph classification (Venugopal et al., 2021), and slot filling (Friedrich et al., 2020). These classification models are evaluated under standard encoder-only settings as used in prior work (Gupta et al., 2022). Detailed descriptions of evaluation metrics are provided in Appendix A.3. 4.2 Main Results Generation Tasks Table 1 shows that MATTER outperforms existing tokenization methods, boosting Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 by 3% and 5% on average. These gains highlight MATTERs broad applicability across materials science tasks. Notably, SAGE and PickyBPE, which introduce nonmaterial-specific signals, perform worse than WordPiece, emphasizing the need for domain-specific knowledge in tokenization. To further examine the generalizability of MATTER, we additionally evaluate its performance on materials-domain QA tasks using decoder-based and encoder-decoder models.2 Classification Tasks Similar to the generation tasks  (Table 2)  , classification results confirm MATTERs superiority, with an average Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 improvement of 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. These consistent gains highlight its robustness and ability to generalize across diverse materials science contexts, reinforcing its impact on materials informatics. To rigorously verify that these improvements are not attributed to random variation, we conducted paired t-tests for both generation and classification tasks. The detailed statistical analysis is presented in Appendix D, confirming 2See Appendix for full details and results.

The resulting subset, as shown in Table 3, revealed that approximately 20% of annotated words are relevant material concepts. Using this subset, we evaluated the morpheme segmentation. As shown in Table 4, MATTER achieved an average improvement of 18.6% in segmentation accuracy compared to other tokenization algorithms. These results confirm that MATTER tokenization, effectively incorporates the characteristics of material corpora, enabling it to segment material concepts into meaningful subwords. 4.3 Material Morpheme Segmentation 4.4 Extracted Material Concepts To validate MATTERs ability to segment material concepts into meaningful subwords, we evaluated its performance on the material subset of the SIGMORPHON dataset (Batsuren et al., 2022). The SIGMORPHON 2022 Shared Task provides reliable benchmark for assessing whether words are segmented into morphologically meaningful units. For this analysis, we identified material concepts shared between SIGMORPHON, PubChem, and Validation on Training Corpus To validate MatDetector on the training corpus, we constructed reference lexicon of 100K material-related entries from PubChem and MatKG, including names, formulas, and synonyms. These were decomposed into 1.6M normalized tokens for broader coverage. Entities extracted from 150K materials papers were matched to the lexicon, and considered valid if found in the lexicon. MatDetector extracted 6 Figure 3: Comparison tokenization methods by wordinitial token ratio (bar), materials token ratio (line), and average token length. Figure 4: Comparison of Macro-F1 scores for MATTER and w/o material knowledge across during tokenization training different number of tokens. more material concepts than ChemDataExtractor and achieved 64% higher match rate, confirming its precision and suitability for identifying material concepts in materials science corpus. Validation on Materials NER To quantify absolute performance, we additionally evaluate both tools on two external materials NER datasets: MatScholar (Weston et al., 2019) and SOFC (Friedrich et al., 2020). As shown in Table 5, which reports the average performance across the two datasets, MatDetector consistently outperforms ChemDataExtractor across precision, recall, and F1 score. Notably, it achieves over twice the F1 score on average, highlighting its effectiveness not only in coverage but also in accurately identifying material entities. Detailed per-dataset results are provided in Appendix E. These results further validate MatDetectors ability to accurately and comprehensively detect material concepts in domain-specific NER tasks. 4.5 Token Qualities To assess material token quality, we extract material-related tokens using MatDetector and compare tokenization methods.More hyperparameters are detailed in Appendix A.4. Word-Initial Token One key aspect of token quality is the proportion of word-initial tokens, which help preserve word structure and meaning (Yehezkel and Pinter, 2023; Chizhov et al., 2024). For example, in tokenizing \"germanium\" into \"german\" and \"-ium\", the word-initial token is \"german\". As shown in the left part of Figure 3, MATTER preserves higher proportion of wordinitial tokens (bar) compared to other methods. To evaluate this more rigorously, we further measured the materials-related word-initial token ratio (line) using manually annotated set of approximately 9,000 material concepts, curated for downstream evaluation only (details in Appendix F). While this represents small fraction of the full corpus, the results consistently demonstrate that MATTER achieves significantly higher proportion of materials-related word-initial tokens, even on unseen datasets. This indicates that its vocabulary is enriched with material-specific terms, enabling better preservation of the semantic integrity of materials-related concepts. Token Length According to Bostrom and Durrett (2020), longer mean token length reflects gold-standard morphologically-aligned tokenization, which enhances token quality. Based on this, we also measure mean token length. As shown in the right part of Figure 3, our method achieves higher mean token length. Notably, it surpasses even SAGE and PickyBPE, which deliberately eliminate shorter intermediate tokens through compression at the cost of increased computational expense. This demonstrates that our approach not only maintains morphological alignment for material concepts but also preserves higher-quality tokenization. Number of Tokens Figure 4 presents the experimental results comparing MATTER with tokenizer trained without material knowledge during tokenization training. The number of tokens was varied from 0.5x to 1.5x of the original size. The results show that MATTER consistently outperTokenization Concept Word Embedding Sim. Formula Word Embedding Sim.

The table presents the five nearest neighbor words based on subword embedding averages for each method. The similarity scores (Sim.) indicate the relevance of the nearest neighbors to the target material concept. Boldface highlights words that are directly related to materials. forms the tokenizer trained without material knowledge in all cases. This demonstrates that providing material-specific information during tokenization training is crucial, regardless of the token count. Subword Embedding Analysis Table 6 presents the two nearest neighbors of material concepts using cosine similarity. The results show that the nearest neighbors of MATTER are more materialspecific and semantically relevant compared to other methods. For instance, while WordPiece and SAGE generate less relevant neighbors (fri, segregation for germanium ), our method produces material concepts such as dithiocarbamate and ammonium for germanium . This indicates our tokenizer better preserves material-specific meanings, improving representation quality for scientific text. Further inspection reveals that the learned subword embeddings capture variety of chemically meaningful relationships. For example, pairs such as PbI2 and PbF2 belong to the same chemical family of lead halides, while germanium and dithiocarbamate co-occur as known compound pairs in GeS coordination complexes. Other relationships reflect compositional connections, such as the coexistence of germanium and ammonium in ammonium tris(oxalato)germanate, or functional similarity, as seen in LFP and ZrF7, both of which are used in energy storage and sensing applications. These findings support the claim that the embedding space goes beyond capturing surface-level co-occurrence, instead reflecting deeper, domainrelevant semantics. more comprehensive analysis and additional examples can be found in Appendix G.2. 4.6 Ablation Study Comparison of Detectors To confirm whether using MatDetector to extract material concepts and assign weights is more suitable for providing accurate and domain-relevant signals in the material domain compared to the widely used ChemDataExtractor, we performed ablation studies. Specifically, we replaced MatDetector with ChemDataExtractor to assign weights. While ChemDataExtractor is capable of partially extracting material concepts, it lacks the ability to assess the importance of the extracted concepts within the material domain. Consequently, all material concepts extracted by ChemDataExtractor were assigned the highest signal weight of 0.99. Table 7 show that using MatDetector outperforms ChemDataExtractor, achieving 2% higher average Micro-F1 score and 2.7% higher MacroF1 score. This confirms that MatDetector is more effective in providing material domain-relevant signals. Additionally, when examining the performance of ChemDataExtractor, we observed that it achieved 1.1% higher Micro-F1 score and 2.3% higher Macro-F1 score compared to the baseline method, which did not incorporate any material signals. This underscores the importance of incorporating material signals into tokenization. However, as evidenced by the performance gap between ChemDataExtractor and MatDetector, it is clear that the accuracy of the material signals plays critical role. These results highlight the necessity of not only incorporating material signals but also ensuring that accurate material concepts and their respective significance are properly considTokenization Metric NER RC EAE PC SAR SC SF Overall MatSci-NLP w/o material knowledge (WordPiece) Micro-F1 76.60.2 80.90.3 48.50.2 73.10.5 81.90.4 90.00.1 57.40.2 72.60.1 Macro-F1 56.10.2 58.50.6 29.40.3 58.91.0 74.60.9 60.30.8 32.60.2 52.90.2 ChemDataExtractor Micro-F1 77.11.1 81.50.7 53.13.5 73.60.6 80.63.3 91.21.0 58.82.5 73.71.3 (Swain and Cole, 2016) Macro-F1 56.41.3 58.90.7 35.04.2 67.61.2 68.09.5 64.80.1 35.61.6 55.22.8 MatDetector (ours) Micro-F1 80.00.0 83.80.1 53.10.2 73.70.2 85.50.3 91.20.1 61.90.3 75.60.1 Macro-F1 59.30.2 59.10.5 36.90.3 67.60.6 79.30.7 64.90.5 38.00.3 57.90.

            "content": "While we have demonstrated that MATTER effectively enhances tokenization for pretrained language models in the materials science domain. Nevertheless, our work also opens several valuable opportunities for further improvements and exploration. Hyperparameter Selection. MATTER introduces tunable hyperparameter (Œª) to balance frequency statistics with material-specific signals during vocabulary construction. While we observed stable improvements across range of Œª values, the method still requires manual selection of this parameter. Although Œª = 1 was found to be effective in our experiments, identifying an optimal value for different domains or corpora may require Figure 5: Comparison of Macro-F1 scores for ChemDataExtractor and MatDetector across Œª values. ered. The use of MatDetector effectively addresses both aspects, demonstrating its suitability for enhancing performance in the material domain. Both detectors achieved their highest performance at Œª value of 1 as show in Figure 5. Comparison of Lambda Figure 5 demonstrates that adding material signals, regardless of the weighting method used, consistently yields better performance compared to the baseline where no material signals were incorporated (Œª =0). This observation aligns with previous findings and further substantiates that the inclusion of material Knowledge is beneficial. Moreover, it emphasizes the necessity of using appropriate tools to effectively assign these signals for optimal performance. Notably, both ChemDataExtractor and MatDetector achieved their highest performance at Œª = 1. Based on this consistent observation across models, all preceding experiments in this study were conducted using this optimal setting. additional tuning. This reliance on hyperparameter selection may affect general usability in practice. Further Analysis on Corpus The current experiments were conducted following the prior methodology outlined in (Gupta et al., 2022), which emphasizes the use of material-specialized corpora. Although this ensures consistency and relevance to domain-specific evaluation, future work may benefit from expanding the diversity of training corpora to test MATTERs generalizability across subdomains and heterogeneous sources. NER Dependency and Scalability Our approach relies on the identification of material concepts through NER-based classification. To support this, we constructed high-quality NER dataset using curated materials knowledge base, ensuring accurate detection of domain-specific terminology essential for effective vocabulary construction in materials science. However, this reliance on supervised signals may introduce challenges in scalability, particularly when applied to broader or less-structured corpora. Addressing this limitation remains an important direction for future work."

            "content": "A.1 Tokenization baseline We compared our tokenization approach against baseline methods, including the widely used frequency-centric tokenization, WordPiece, as well as more recent and strong tokenization methods, SAGE and PickyBPE. To ensure fair comparison, all tokenization methods adhered to the vocabulary size of 31,090, as defined in the prior methodology (Gupta et al., 2022). The implementation details are as follows: WordPiece (Wu et al., 2016) being one of the most widely used and fundamental frequencycentric tokenization methods, was configured with min frequency of 2 and limit alphabet of 6,000. SAGE (Yehezkel and Pinter, 2023) enhances frequency-centric tokenization by incorporating contextual signals into the process. The implementation of SAGE included several key parameters: vocabulary schedule progressively reducing from 32,000 to the target size of 31,090; an embedding schedule synchronized with the vocabulary schedule; maximum token length of 17 bytes; and the use of skip-gram embedding training with vector size of 50, context window size of 5, and 15 negative samples. To ensure reproducibility, the random seed was set to 692,653. PickyBPE (Chizhov et al., 2024) was employed to construct the vocabulary, with desired vocabulary size of 31,090 and an IoS (Importance of Symbols) threshold set to 0.9. The initial vocabulary ensured comprehensive coverage with relative symbol coverage of 0.9999. During training, the frequency of merges was logged at intervals of 200 merges to monitor the tokenization process effectively. A.2 Hyper-parameters Pre-Train.

            "content": "MatDetector is domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool designed to extract material concepts from scientific texts. The detailed steps for its construction are as follows: Crawling Material Corpus To construct the training dataset for the MatDetector, we first extract chemical names, IUPAC names, synonyms, and molecular formulas from PubChem (Kim et al., 2019), obtaining 80K material concepts. The number of concepts by category is provided in Table (Kim et al., 2019). Using these extracted concepts as keywords, we collect 42K scientific papers from Semantic Scholar (Ammar et al., 2018), focusing on titles and abstracts that contain high-density material knowledge, with detailed comparative information in Table 9. Creating Train Dataset While Semantic Scholar provides relatively clean data, most materialrelated data is collected from various journals and repositories, where formatting inconsistencies, OCR errors, and structural variations introduce significant noise. To address this, we construct Noisy NER Dataset, improving model robustness and expanding the dataset to be four times larger than the original. The details of noise augmentation are as follow: Material Name Noise: This includes capitalization errors in element symbols, misplaced or duplicated digits, reordering of elements, and insertion of unnecessary characters or special symbols. These modifications reflect common errors found in chemical names and mimic the inconsistencies in scientific documents. Material Formula Noise: Common formatting inconsistencies in formulas are simulated by adding spaces around special symbols such as (, ), [, and ], or by replacing digits with placeholders. Combined patterns are also introduced to replicate multiple error types. Using this dataset, we generate material NER dataset by tagging the collected corpus with material concepts extracted from PubChem, ensuring precise identification of material-related terminology. In this tagging process, Material Name, IUPAC Name, and Synonym of Material Name are categorized as Material Concept, while Material Formula is tagged separately as Material Formula. This approach maintains clear distinction between conceptual material entities and their chemical formulas, enabling more accurate entity recognition in materials science applications. Training the MatDetector We train the MatDetector using the material NER dataset constructed in the previous step and the Trewartha et al. (2022) model architecture. The model achieves high accuracy in detecting material concepts, even in noisy corpora, and provides NER tagging probabilities, estimating the likelihood that concepts belongs to materials science."

The average F1 score was computed as the arithmetic mean of the Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 values for each task. The paired t-test evaluates whether the mean difference in Avg-F1 scores between MATTER and baseline is statistically significant. The t-statistic is given by: = sd/ where is the mean of the differences between MATTER and baseline across tasks, sd is the standard deviation of those differences, and = 8 is the number of generation tasks.

To validate the effectiveness of our tokenization and avoid any potential circularity in evaluation, we perform an additional analysis using external and independent sources of material-related terms, separate from those used to construct the tokenization. Specifically, we collect named entities from two manually annotated materials NER datasets used in the paper: NER Dataset #Material Entity MatScholar (Weston et al., 2019) SOFC (Friedrich et al., 2020) Total 8,660 1,201 9,861 Case Study: Tokenization Robustness G.1 Analysis in Material Science Papers In this section, we applied WordPiece, SAGE, PickyBPE, and the proposed method, MATTER, to tokenization results from real materials science papers. As shown in Table 18, existing tokenization methods such as WordPiece, SAGE, and PickyBPE tend to overtokenize important material concepts. For instance, the chemical formula for Lead, \"Pb\", is split into \"p-b\", while \"dimethylsiloxane\" is divided into \"dimethyl-sil-oxane or d-imethyl-sil-oxane\". Such overtokenization distorts the semantic integrity of material concepts and can degrade the performance of downstream natural language processing tasks. Type of material concept #material concept Material name IUPAC name Synonym of material name Material formula 22,482 22,482 719,885 22,479 Table 17: Summary of approximately 80K extracted material concepts from PubMed, categorized by concepts type. Figure 6: Comparison of Micro-F1 scores for ChemDataExtractor and MatDetector across different Œª values. strating stronger connection to materials science concepts. Similarly, ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid retrieves -oxycarb and -sulfanyl, which accurately reflect its chemical properties. These results suggest that MATTER effectively mitigates tokenization-induced distortions, leading to more precise materials science word representations that enhance performance in downstream NLP tasks such as entity linking, material property prediction, and knowledge graph construction. G.3 Comparison of Lambda Details The Macro-F1 scores for ChemDataExtractor and MatDetector were compared across different Œª values to evaluate their performance. The specific numerical values are detailed in Table 20 and Table 21, while Figure 6 provides visual representation for easier interpretation. In contrast, our proposed MATTER method effectively prevents the overtokenization of material concepts. When applying MATTER, essential material concepts such as \"Pb\", \"dimethylsiloxan\"e, and \"barium sulfate\" remain intact, preserving their contextual meaning. Notably, complex material concepts such as \"perovskite\" and \"ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\" are properly maintained, demonstrating that MATTER provides more suitable tokenization approach for materials science texts. G.2 Subword Embedding Analysis To evaluate the impact of different tokenization methods on word representations in materials science, we analyze the nearest neighbors of material concepts based on subword embedding averaging. This experiment is conducted in conjunction with the tokenization results presented in Figure 1 and Table 18, allowing us to assess how subword segmentation affects semantic consistency in word embeddings. We compare four tokenization strategiesWordPiece, SAGE, PickyBPE, and our proposed method, MATTERby computing word embeddings as the mean of their constituent subword embeddings. The similarity between words is measured using cosine similarity, and the five nearest neighbors (5-NN) for each concept are retrieved. The retrieved neighbors allow us to assess whether the tokenization method preserves materials science semantics or introduces artifacts from suboptimal subword segmentation. The dataset used for evaluation includes materials science terminology, chemical formulas, and domain-specific abbreviations, ensuring realistic assessment of tokenization impact. The results, presented in Table 19, indicate that WordPiece and SAGE exhibit strong tendency to retrieve words that share surface-level subword structures rather than those with true material relevance. For instance, germanium is tokenized as german-ium in WordPiece, leading to nearest neighbors such as german and -ium, which lack meaningful chemical associations. PickyBPE partially alleviates this issue by merging frequent subwords, but still retrieves words that reflect tokenization artifacts rather than conceptually related material concepts. In contrast, our MATTER method significantly improves semantic alignment by retrieving chemically relevant words. For example, the nearest neighbors of germanium include dithiocarbamate, ammonium, and borohydride, demonMethod Origin WordPiece SAGE PickyBPE Tokenized Output poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) waschosen to form the elastomeric circuit board, mechanically protecting and electrically insulating the wires, based on itsdurability, adjustable stiffness, biocompatibility, and commer-cial availability as an insulating compound.
