            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Numerous large language models (LLMs), both closed-source and open-source (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), are now available to the community. Evaluating their alignment with human preferences is crucial for selecting appropriate models in downstream applications (Ouyang et al., 2022). To meet this need, Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) provides an open platform for evaluating LLMs based on human preferences. However, it typically takes weeks or even months for newly released LLM to collect statistically enough human votes. To reduce reliance on human annotations, automatic LLM benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024), Arena-Hard-Auto (Li et al., 2024b), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) use LLM-based auto-annotators to evaluate language models. These automatic benchmarks are cheap, scalable, and have high Spearman correlations with Chatbot Arena (Li et al., 2023c). These advantages make them popular choices for providing timely assessments of newly released LLMs (Meng et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a), where high win rates can lead to significant promotional benefits. While automatic benchmarks offer valuable way for comparing LLMs, recent studies have revealed that auto-annotated win rates can be affected by biases related to output length and style (Dubois et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024). In most cases, these biases are unintentional, stemming from the training data distribution; however, they can still game win rates, causing leaderboard results to deviate from actual human preferences. To mitigate this issue, several strategies have been introduced to control for output length and disentangle style from content, thereby reducing the potential for gameability (Dubois et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a). Equal contribution. Work done during Xiaosen Zhengs internship at Sea AI Lab. Correspondence to Tianyu Pang and Jing Jiang. 1 Preprint But, what if an adversary intentionally cheats auto-annotators to achieve high win rates and capitalize on the resulting promotional benefits? In this study, we conduct stress tests on these benchmarks by submitting null models that, instead of responding to input instructions, generate constant outputs. Our initial experiments use ChatGPT to craft dozens of persuasive responses (Zeng et al., 2024) expecting auto-annotators to favor them and gain high win rates. Note that persuasive responses do not respond to input instructions, so human annotators will assign them zero win rates. We submit these persuasive responses to AlpacaEval 2.0 after wrapping them as null models. For instance, null model NullModel(\"Pick me!\") always returns the same output Pick me! for all the 805 input instructions in AlpacaEval 2.0, without providing any informative response. As seen in Figure 1(b), the AlpacaEval 2.0 auto-annotator (GPT-4-1106-preview) is robust to these persuasive responses, assigning win rates of less than 1%. Pseudo-code for Null Models class NullModel(): def __init__(self, const_str): # no trainable parameters self.output = const_str def generate(self, instruct): # irrelevant to instructions return self.output Nevertheless, we find that structured cheating responses can cheat the auto-annotator by exploiting weakness in LLMs, which may become confused during syntactic analysis when processing the evaluation templates, such as those used in AlpacaEval 2.0. manually crafted cheating response that is structured can already achieve 76.8% LC win rate, as seen in Figure 1(c). We further modify this structured response by adding prefix and optimizing it through random search based on querying results from GPT-4 (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). To simulate more challenging scenarios, we assume that all input instructions of the automatic benchmarks are private. Thus, we craft transferable prefix using public set of instructions from UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023). We then evaluate this optimized prefix, concatenated with the structured cheating responses, by testing it on AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench as reported in Table 2. Additionally, we use open-source LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct (Meta, 2024; Touvron et al., 2023) as auto-annotators and conduct further ablation studies to verify our findings. Anti-cheating has long been critical consideration when designing the rules for leaderboards (Blum & Hardt, 2015), but this remains unexplored in the context of LLM benchmarks. While our experiments in this paper are primarily proof-of-concept, determined adversary could leverage LLMs to generate more subtle and imperceptible cheating responses (Liu et al., 2023a; Chao et al., 2023), unethically gaining high win rates and promotional advantages. Our findings highlight the urgent need to develop robust anti-cheating mechanisms to ensure reliable automatic LLM benchmarks."

            "content": "LLM-based auto-annotators. We focus on the problem of evaluating outputs from LLMs using auto-annotators. Formally, we define model LLM : as function that transforms an input sequence of tokens into an output sequence of tokens, where is the vocabulary. Given an instruction , the LLM generates response LLM(I) . To evaluate these responses, we introduce an auto-annotator function JUDGE : P(Y), where represents the evaluation output space, and P(Y) denotes the space of probability distributions over Y. For instance, in MTBench, there is = {1, 2, ..., 10}, representing score range; while in AlpacaEval 2.0, there is = {m, M}, indicating binary judgments. The auto-annotator assesses the instruction I, the response from the target model LLMtar(I), and optionally, the response from reference model LLMref(I). The output of the auto-annotator is either JUDGE(ILLMtar(I)), evaluating the target model alone, or JUDGE(ILLMref(I)LLMtar(I)), comparing the target and reference models to compute win rates. Threat model of cheating. The cheater is assumed to have no direct access to the auto-annotators parameters but can query the auto-annotator through an API provided by service provider. Additionally, the cheater has no access to the test input instructions. The cheaters goal is to craft null model and manipulate the auto-annotators evaluation to favor the constant, non-informative response outputs from the null model, rather than preferring the responses from the reference model. Experimental setup. Our experiments utilize the official evaluation templates associated with different LLM-based evaluations unless stated otherwise. We evaluate our cheating method on AlpacaEval 2.0 (Li et al., 2023c; Dubois et al., 2024), Arena-Hard-Auto (Li et al., 2024b), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) as detailed in Table 1.

We adhere to each benchmarks evaluation criteria when reporting our results. For AlpacaEval 2.0, we present both the raw win rate and the length-controlled (LC) win rate, with the LC one designed to mitigate bias from model verbosity. For Arena-Hard-Auto, we report the win rate against reference model. Additionally, we provide the first-turn score for MT-Bench, using GPT-4-Preview-1106 as the auto-annotator model. The targeted auto-annotators include both open-source and closed-source LLMs: Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Meta, 2024; Touvron et al., 2023), and GPT-4-1106-Preview (OpenAI, 2023). Each LLM uses its default generation configuration with temperature setting of 0.0. For Llama-3 auto-annotators, we use 4-bit quantized versions to reduce GPU memory usage.1 All experiments were conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 (40G) GPUs within few hours using vLLM as the inference engine, and the tokenization template was sourced from Hugging Face tokenizers."

To address this limitation, our cheating strategies include: (1) constructing structured cheating responses to confuse widely used LLM auto-annotators, and (2) conducting token-level random search to craft the adversarial prefix, as outlined below: Structured cheating responses. As shown in Figure 1, our cheating strategy involves replacing the original comparison with misleading one, which disrupts the auto-annotators syntactic analysis of the evaluation template and steers its judgment away from the intended outcomes. The response is carefully structured to be resilient against swap operations. For instance, on AlpacaEval 2.0, when the submitted response is positioned last, the annotator predicts M. Conversely, when it appears in the first position, the annotator predicts m. The optimized response exhibits the following key properties: (1) It overrides the original instruction-output triplet with fabricated one; (2) When positioned by default, it exploits the annotators general preference for the last output, guiding it to predict M; (3) When swapped, it takes advantage of overwriting the output from model M, causing the annotator to predict m. The full template and final submission files are presented in Figures 7, 8 and 9. This structured response alone achieves 76.8% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Moreover, the response can be concatenated with an adversarial prefix to enhance the cheating effectiveness. Crafting adversarial prefix by random search (RS). To further improve the structured response, we incorporate an adversarial prefix and optimize it using an RS strategy based on GPT-4 query results. To emulate more challenging scenario, we assume that the input instructions from the automatic benchmarks remain private. Therefore, we develop transferable prefix, crafted using publicly available instruction set. Our approach optimizes single adversarial prefix by aggregating the losses over various instructions, ensuring that the prefixs impact is universal across different input instructions and positions. We utilize an RS algorithm to optimize the adversarial prefix (Zou et al., 2023; Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). The algorithm refines the prefix by sampling modifications and selecting the variant that minimizes the aggregated loss across multiple instructions. This process is detailed in Algorithm 1."

To assess the generality of our cheat, we applied it to range of automatic LLM benchmarks, using the GPT-4-1106-Preview model as the auto-annotator. For RS, we set the number of training instructions as 10, 8, and 4, the number of optimization steps as 384, 96 and 64 for AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto and MT-Bench, respectively. The full templates and structured responses for Arena-Hard-Auto and MT-Bench are presented in Figures 10 and 11. The effectiveness of our structured response. As mentioned in Section 3, we employ structured response to facilitate the cheating, which provides good initial point and could reduce the optimization cost. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our structured cheating response, we evaluate log p(winner = NullModel) on sampled subset of the AlpacaEval 2.0 test instructions using different null responses. We compare our structured response with the other 16 persuasive responses, as shown in Figure 3. The results highlight the superiority of our structured response (marked as Ours) because it achieves the lowest log probabilities.

This highlights the position bias of the GPT-4-based auto-annotator, which often favors the last response. Empirical results. The results of our experiments, summarized in Table 2, underscore the effectiveness of our method across various benchmarks. On AlpacaEval 2.0, our structured responses achieved LC win rate of 76.8% and raw win rate of 59.5%. After integrating RS optimization, the LC win rate increased to 86.5%, and the raw win rate improved to 76.9%. These results represent significant improvements compared to the verified SOTA model, which achieves only 57.5% LC and 51.3% raw win rates. Our structured approach with random search outperforms the verified SOTA 29.0 percentage points in LC win rate and 25.6 in raw win rate. Compared to the community SOTA, our method achieves better performance in LC (86.5% vs. 78.5%) and is comparable in raw win rates (76.9% vs. 77.6%). Additionally, the LC win rates of our cheats are generally higher than the raw win rates because of their short length, which highlights that AlpacaEval 2.0 is also not robust to length cheat. On the Arena-Hard-Auto, our structured approach achieves win rate of 67.2%, which increases to 83.0% after the random search. This is particularly notable because our final win rate matches the performance of the verified SOTA model, which stands at 82.6%. For the MT-Bench, our structured responses initially achieve an average score of 7.75, which increases to 9.55 with random search optimization. This brings the score greatly outperforming the verified SOTA score of 8.96. In summary, our method achieves substantial gains over the state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across various benchmarks, and reinforcing the need for more robust automatic LLM benchmarks. 5 Preprint Table 3: Evaluation of auto-annotators vs. human annotations on AlpacaEval.

            "title": "5 ABLATION STUDIES ON OPEN-SOURCE AUTO-ANNOTATORS",
            "content": "To better understand the mechanism behind our method, we conduct extensive ablation studies on auto-annotators based on open-source LLMs. We focus on open-source Llama-3-instruct (8B, 70B parameters) (Meta, 2024; Touvron et al., 2023). These models have been well-aligned by pair-wise preference data and show the ability to evaluate other LLMs.2 For RS, we set = 8 and = 8192. Sanity check. Before we use Llama-3-Instruct models as our auto-annotator in the AlpacaEval framework, we conduct sanity check to see whether they have such evaluation capability. We evaluate different automatic annotators on the AlpacaEval set by comparing 2.5K human annotations collected by Dubois et al. (2023). As shown in Table 3, both Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-3-70BInstruct show non-trivial human agreement and correlations. More concretely, Llama-3-8B-Instruct is comparable to ChatGPT, and Llama-3-70B-Instruct matches GPT-4 auto-annotator. Thus, it is reasonable to use them as the auto-annotators. Is the structured response useful on open-source auto-annotators? We evaluate the log p(winner = NullModel) on subset of the AlpacaEval 2.0 test instructions using different null responses. As shown in Figure 4, the structured response has little effect on Llama-3 autoannotators. In the case of Llama-3-8B-Instruct, the structured response does not exploit positional weaknesses in this model as the log probabilities for the default and swapped positions are generally similar to different persuasive responses. However, on Llama-3-70B-Instruct, we observe that under the swap setting, the structured response manages to reduce the log probability. Additionally, regarding the positional bias, the Llama-3-8B-Instruct shows little position bias as the probabilities for both default and swapped positions are fairly close. In contrast, Llama-3-70B-Instruct shows clear positional bias under the swapped setting, with higher log probability, indicating the models strong preference for the last output (M). The larger Llama-3-70B-Instruct model behaves more similarly to the more advanced GPT-4, as it demonstrates greater response to both the structured response and positional bias than the smaller 8B model. This suggests that model size may contribute to the susceptibility to our cheating techniques. Overall, the structured response is considerably less effective on the Llama-3 models compared to GPT-4. possible explanation for this difference is that the instruction-following capabilities of the Llama-3 models, especially the smaller 8B variant, are not as powerful as those of GPT-4, making them less prone to cheating responses. Is random search effective on open-source auto-annotators? The results shown in Table 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of random search on open-source auto-annotators like Llama-3-8BInstruct and Llama-3-70B-Instruct. For Llama-3-8B-Instruct, without random search, the structured response achieves only 2.9% LC win rate and 1.4% raw win rate. However, when the random search is applied, the win rates surge dramatically to 95.4% (LC) and 86.3% (raw), representing gain of 92.5 percentage points in the LC win rate. For Llama-3-70B-Instruct, the structured response 2https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval/pull/314 Preprint Figure 4: Boxplot of the log p(winner = NullModel) using different null responses across different responses and auto-annotators. The structured response (index=0) is not as effective for the Llama models as for GPT-4-1106-Preview. An interesting observation is that, on Llama-3-70BInstruct, the structured response successfully reduces the log probability under the swap setting. In contrast, the structured response is ineffective on Llama-3-8B-Instruct for both positions, implying that its effectiveness may be related to the models ability to follow instructions. alone yields minimal success with 0.4% LC win rate and 0.2% overall. Once random search is applied, these win rates leap to 95.1% (LC) and 91.6% (raw), showcasing improvements of 94.7 and 91.4 percentage points, respectively. These results indicate that random search is highly effective in improving the cheats success on open-source auto-annotators, driving win rates close to 100%. Does searching on the test instructions directly help? We also consider direct cheating. Direct cheating serves as an indicator of the upper bound of transfer cheating. The results shown in Table 4 clearly show that searching directly on the test instructions significantly boosts the cheats performance. For the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using the structured response combined with random search without test instruction access achieves strong LC win rate of 95.4% and an overall win rate of 86.3%. However, when the adversarial prefix is optimized directly on the test instructions, the LC win rate jumps to an almost perfect 99.8%, and the overall win rate increases to 99.4%, representing gains of 4.6 and 13.1 percentage points, respectively. Similarly, for the Llama-3-70B-Instruct model, random search without access to test instructions results in an LC win rate of 95.1% and an overall win rate of 91.6%. When the test instructions are used, these rates climb to 99.4% (LC) and 98.2% (raw), showing improvements of around 4.3 percentage points for LC and 6.6 for overall win rate. These results highlight that directly searching on the test instructions offers significant advantages, further optimizing the adversarial prefix and nearly achieving perfect performance. Can our method be combined with normal responses? Our method can be combined with normal, informative responses by appending our cheating response to the original responses. As demonstrated in Figure 5, when combined with more informative model like GPT-3.5-0613, we observe that the initial win rates are already high, even before significant optimization steps are taken. This is evident in Figure 5b and 5d, where the performance (win rate and length-controlled win rate) increases steadily from high baseline as optimization progresses. However, it is important to emphasize that our setting of using null, non-informative model is far more challenging. In this setting (Figure 5a and 5c), the null model starts with much lower win rates because it offers no relevant information to the input queries, making it much harder to trick the auto-annotator. Despite this, as the optimization steps progress, the null models performance steadily increases, ultimately achieving competitive win rates. This highlights the robustness of our method, showing that it can manipulate Preprint Table 4: Win rates of the cheat against Llama-3-Instruct family. We present the win rates of our cheat on AlpacaEval 2.0 when targeting models in the Llama-3-Instruct family. We evaluate different methods (Structured and Structured+Random Search) with and without access to test instructions. The results are measured using LC win rate, raw win rate, and discrete comparison metrics. We also explore the effect of different auto-annotators and random search optimization. The upper-bound win rates are approached by assuming the visibility of test instructions.

            "content": "To address the vulnerabilities exposed by our cheat, benchmark developers must take proactive measures to ensure the safety and integrity of automatic LLM evaluation systems. For example, one immediate step could involve integrating specialized detectors designed to identify and mitigate adversarial manipulations targeting LLM-based benchmarks. Template paraphrasing. Previous research has suggested that paraphrasing the input can be an effective defense against jailbreaking on language models (Jain et al., 2023). Building on this idea, one potential defense against our cheat is to release only paraphrased versions of the auto-annotator template, while keeping the real template private. The rationale behind this approach is that the paraphrased templates would be harder for adversaries to exploit directly. To evaluate this defense, we experimented using Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the evaluation model. We utilized ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) to rewrite the official auto-annotator template into multiple paraphrased variants as shown in Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15. We next conduct random search on these rewritten templates and tested the optimized responses effectiveness on AlpacaEval 2.0s original (unseen) official auto-annotator template. As shown in Table 5, despite the template paraphrasing, we are still able to achieve high win rates (e.g. 92.1% LC win rate). This demonstrates that simply releasing paraphrased templates is insufficient as defense mechanism, as the cheat remains effective even when the original template is kept private. More robust defenses are required to fully address this issue. PPL filter. We utilize GPT-4-1106-Preview as the auto-annotator to evaluate the effectiveness of PPL-based filter. The perplexity (PPL) is computed using GPT-2, following the methodology described by Alon & Kamfonas (2023). Specifically, we adopt the windowed PPL approach with window size of 32, as suggested by Jain et al. (2023), to better capture localized fluctuations in perplexity that may reflect manipulative or adversarial patterns in the output. To ensure that the baseline outputs are not inadvertently filtered, we set the PPL threshold to the maximum perplexity observed from GPT-4-1106-Preview baseline outputs. This ensures that all outputs from the reference model remain unaffected by the filter, allowing us to focus on detecting and filtering out adversarial outputs with higher perplexities. As illustrated in Figure 6, our results demonstrate that despite setting high threshold, the PPL filter fails to consistently identify adversarial outputs. For instance, our structured response with win rates as high as 76.8% still exhibits perplexities below the threshold, rendering the filter ineffective. This suggests that relying solely on PPL, even in windowed configuration, is insufficient to robustly detect adversarial manipulations aimed at influencing LLM judgments. 8 Preprint (a) Null Model (b) GPT-3.5-0613 (c) Null Model (d) GPT-3.5-0613 Figure 5: Win rates along the number of steps across different models. The win rates increase generally as the optimization steps grow. Notably, incorporating an informative model like GPT3.5-0613 with our cheat has high initial win rates, indicating the challenge of our null model setting. Nonetheless, our cheat drives both models to over 90% win rates."

            "content": "LLM-based evaluation. Evaluating open-ended generation poses challenges due to the lack of single valid ground truth. Human evaluation, though reliable, is expensive and time-consuming. To reduce costs and enable fast evaluation, powerful LLMs are often used as judges, LLM-based evaluators have been used for various specific tasks: providing AI feedback (Bai et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023; Gudibande et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Tan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; 2024; McAleese et al., 2024), evaluating text summarization (Gao et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023), detecting LLM hallucination (Li et al., 2023a; Manakul et al., 2023; Adlakha et al., 2023; Cohen et al., 2023) etc. More recently, people have proposed to use powerful proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate the general ability of LLMs as seen in benchmarks like G-eval (Liu et al., 2023b), MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023), AlpacaEval (Dubois et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c; Dubois et al., 2024), ArenaHard (Li et al., 2024c), WildBench (Lin et al., 2024), and MixEval (Ni et al., 2024). Attacking LLM-based evaluations. While initially studied in the context of image classification, adversarial examples for language models have more recently been demonstrated for several tasks: question answering (Jia & Liang, 2017; Wallace et al., 2019), document classification (Ebrahimi et al., 2018), sentiment analysis (Alzantot et al., 2018; Maus et al., 2023), and toxicity (Jones et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2019). More recently, Shi et al. (2023) found that LLM can be distracted by irrelevant context easily. Besides, there are also lot of analyses to improve the robustness and reduce the bias of LLM-based evaluations. Liu et al. (2024) study the role of pairwise preferences in LLM evaluator alignment. Zheng et al. (2023) discusses the three limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge: position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limited capability in grading math and reasoning questions. Regarding the verbosity bias, LLM judgers are known to be biased toward longer responses (Dubois et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b). More recently, there has been growing interest in exploring the adversarial robustness of LLM evaluators themselves. Raina et al. (2024) demonstrated that short, universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to responses to manipulate LLM evaluators into assigning inflated scores. Similarly, Shi et al. (2024) proposed an optimization-based prompt injection attack that allows an adversary to craft sequences designed to bias the LLM-as-a-Judge toward selecting particular response, regardless of the input or competing responses. Chen et al. (2024c) introduced an adversarial framework targeting natural language generation evaluators, showcasing the vulnerabilities of these systems to manipulation. Independently, we propose null model cheating on automatic LLM benchmarks. Our work differs from these prior efforts in several aspects: 1) Unlike previous attacks that manipulate meaningful responses by appending adversarial suffixes, we propose the use of completely non-informative null model that generates the same irrelevant output for all input instructions. This approach does not rely on producing contextually relevant responses, making it distinct from existing response-based adversarial attacks; 2) While many of the earlier works focus on optimizing individual prompts or attacks specific to given input (Raina et al., 2024), our approach emphasizes the creation of universal, transferable adversarial prompts. These prompts are designed to work across various instructions without direct access to those instructions, offering more generalized 9 Preprint Table 5: Effect of rewritten auto-annotator templates on defending against cheat. We conduct random search optimization on four rewritten versions of AlpacaEval 2.0s official autoannotator template and test the transferability of the cheat on the unseen official template. The results indicate that training on the rewritten templates generalizes well to the official template, as shown by the high win rates achieved with the structured responses plus random search (RS).

We plot the windowed perplexity (PPL) for GPT-4 Preview (11/06), GPT3.5 Turbo (06/13), and LLaMA2-Chat 7B. The cyan dashed line indicates the PPL of our structured response with 76.8% LC win rate while the pink one represents the PPL of our RSaugmented structured response with 86.5% LC win rate. The results suggest that PPL filter is insufficient to defend our structured response. and powerful cheating strategy; 3) Most existing studies have focused on attacking open-source models or less-used benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has systematically targeted widely-used, state-of-the-art benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard-Auto, or demonstrated the ability to achieve top-ranked win rates on these platforms. Our work presents the first comprehensive cheating on these highly influential LLM benchmarks. Jailbreaking LLMs. Though cheating automatic LLM benchmarks and jailbreaking are motivated by different research goals, they share similar methodologies. Research in red-teaming has demonstrated that aligned LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) can be jailbroken to produce harmful or unintended outputs through carefully crafted manual or automated prompts (Chao et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023; Hayase et al., 2024; Lapid et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023a;c; Perez et al., 2022; Rao et al., 2023; Ruan et al., 2023; Toyer et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Paulus et al., 2024; Liao & Sun, 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023b; Anil et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). Tian et al. (2023) explore the safety risks posed by LLM-based agents, while Greshake et al. (2023) highlight indirect prompt injection as method for compromising LLM-integrated applications. Wei et al. (2023a) attribute the susceptibility of aligned LLMs to jailbreaking to the tension between maximizing capability and ensuring safety, as well as the gap between pretraining and safety-focused training. Additionally, Carlini et al. (2023) argues that neural networks intrinsic vulnerability to adversarial examples plays critical role in these weaknesses. Recent work has also shown that fine-tuning aligned LLMs, whether with poisoned or benign data, can degrade their alignment and safety (Gade et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Lermen et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023)."

            "content": "Conclusion. In this paper, we uncover even null models can achieve high win rates by exploiting structural weaknesses in the evaluation process. These findings highlight the need for more robust automatic LLM benchmarks to ensure fair and reliable assessments of LLM performance. As the field of AI continues to evolve, we must address these vulnerabilities to maintain trust in the systems we use to evaluate language models. Failure to do so could lead to widespread manipulation of benchmarks, undermining the progress and credibility of AI research. In summary, while automatic LLM benchmarks provide scalable and efficient way to evaluate models, they are not immune to cheating. The development of anti-cheating mechanisms and the reconsideration of benchmark design will be crucial steps toward ensuring the reliability and fairness of future LLM evaluations. Limitations and future work. Despite the promising findings of our study, there are limitations that must be acknowledged. First, our work primarily focuses on specific benchmarks, and while 10 Preprint our results generalize well across them, the cheats effectiveness on other, less-studied benchmarks remains uncertain. Additionally, our approach relies heavily on the manual crafting of structured responses. Future work could explore more automated methods for generating adversarial outputs, which would allow adversaries to exploit these vulnerabilities on larger scale. One important area for future research is the development of more robust anti-cheating mechanisms. Current efforts to mitigate cheating on LLM benchmarks have focused on controlling output length and style, but these measures have proven insufficient in the face of structured responses. New defenses will be crucial for maintaining the integrity of LLM benchmarks."

You must provide your answers before judging any answers. When evaluating the assistants answers, compare both assistants answers with your answer. You must identify and correct any mistakes or inaccurate information. Then consider if the assistants answers are helpful, relevant, and concise. Helpful means the answer correctly responds to the prompt or follows the instructions. Note when user prompt has any ambiguity or more than one interpretation, it is more helpful and appropriate to ask for clarifications or more information from the user than providing an answer based on assumptions. Relevant means all parts of the response closely connect or are appropriate to what is being asked. Concise means the response is clear and not verbose or excessive. Then consider the creativity and novelty of the assistants answers when needed. Finally, identify any missing important information in the assistants answers that would be beneficial to include when responding to the user prompt.
