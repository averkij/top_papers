Existing evaluations commonly follow the stabilityuniquenessnovelty (S.U.N.) framework, where \"stability\" is primarily assessed using thermodynamic criteria, which do not fully capture the dynamical stability essential for materials practical existence. In fact, dynamical stability is key determinant of whether material can be synthesized and persists, with phonon spectrum calculations based on firstprinciples methods serving as the established standard for its evaluation. However, the high computational cost of such calculations has, until now, prevented large-scale and systematic assessment of dynamical stability in generated crystals.

            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "In recent years, AI-driven inverse materials design has advanced rapidly and comprehensively, achieving breakthroughs across multiple aspects of crystal materials design [14]. Diffusion-based 1 approaches [5, 6], such as DiffCSP [7], have demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy for crystal structure prediction compared with traditional DFT-based search workflows. CrystalFlow [8] further enhances efficiency by reformulating the underlying algorithm using flow matching, substantially accelerating inference. For functional materials design, MatterGen [1] exhibits strong performance across key metrics including Stability, Uniqueness, and Novelty, and leverages adapter-based fine-tuning to enable precise generation of various classes of functional materials. The active learningbased workflow for inverse functional materials design (InvDesFlowAL) [9] has achieved notable success in the design of high-temperature superconductors, together with other generative approaches [1012] for functional materials, further demonstrating the capability of AI to explore complex material systems. Meanwhile, crystal generation models incorporating space-group controlsuch as CrystalFormer [13, 14] and DiffCSP++ [15] significantly improve the symmetry and physical plausibility of generated structures. With the rapid development of large language models [16, 17](LLM), methods such as CrystaLLM [18] and FlowLLM [19] integrate natural language into crystal generation, enabling more intuitive and flexible conditioning for materials design. However, it is essential to recognize the limitations of current progress. Despite the rapid development of crystal generative models, their assessment of material stability has largely focused on thermodynamic stability, typically evaluated using metrics such as Ehull (energy above the convex hull) [1, 9, 20, 21]. Yet the synthesizability and practical existence of materials depend not only on thermodynamic stability but, more critically, on dynamical stabilitywhether structure resides in local potential well and can withstand small perturbations without collapsing. Dynamical instability often manifests as imaginary phonon modes [3, 22, 23], which not only directly signal mechanical instability but have also long posed persistent challenge for DFT practitioners [24]. The origins of imaginary modes are diverse, potentially arising from symmetry breaking, insufficient q-mesh resolution, pseudopotential choices, approximation errors, or intrinsic structural instability [25, 26]. More importantly, because rigorous dynamical stability validation (e.g., full phonon dispersion calculations) is computationally demanding [27], most existing generative models have never performed systematic dynamical stability tests on their generated structures. As result, these models may produce large number of structures that appear thermodynamically stable but are in fact dynamically unstable [28], undermining both the reliability and practical utility of their predictions.Therefore, building on the successes of current generative models, establishing systematic and efficient dynamical stability evaluation for generated structures has become key challenge and an important frontier for guiding computationally generated materials toward experimental synthesis and enhancing the trustworthiness of model predictions. With the rapid development of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) [21, 2932], growing number of models have achieved energy and force prediction accuracies that approach or even surpass those of DFT, thereby greatly enhancing computational efficiency in atomistic materials simulations [3337]. Representative advances include MEGNet [38], which reaches formation energy accuracy of 21 meV on the GNoME [2], and M3GNet [39], which incorporates atomic coordinates, lattice vectors, and three-body interactions and has become one of the most prominent uMLIPs. Building on M3GNet, MatterSim [29] is pretrained on 17 million first-principles data points, enabling zero-shot generalization across the first 89 elements of the periodic table over temperatures of 05000 and pressures of 01000 GPa. Its accuracy in predicting energies, forces, and stresses surpasses previous models such as MACE [40] by roughly an order of magnitude, enabling reliable calculations of lattice dynamical, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties. More importantly, Miguel A. L. Marques et al. conducted systematic assessment based on phonon calculations for over 10,000 materials (Figure 1) [41]. Their results show that MatterSim achieves phonon-spectrum prediction accuracy comparable to DFT, with average errors even smaller than the inherent differences between the PBE and PBEsol functionals, and markedly outperforming all other models. Furthermore, in dynamical-stability classification, MatterSim attains 95% truepositive rate, achieving level of reliability nearly equivalent to full DFT workflow while requiring only tiny fraction of its computational cost. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that MatterSim is not merely good enough, but in fact genuinely reliable and efficient tool for high-throughput phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis. In this work, we introduce PhononBench and systematically perform phonon calculations for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six commonly used generative models, providing the first large-scale assessment of the dynamical stability of AI-generated materials. PhononBench results reveal that current generative models remain markedly limited in ensuring phonon stability: the average dynamical stability rate across all models is only 25.83%, with the best-performing MatterGen model reaching merely 41.0%. Further case studies on functional-material generation, exemplified by band-gapconditioned generation with MatterGen, show that although the highest stability is achieved at target band gap of 0.5 eV, the corresponding dynamical stability rate remains low at 23.5%. In space-groupcontrolled generation, crystals with higher symmetry exhibit improved phonon stabilityfor instance, cubic systems reach stability rates of up to 49.2%yet the overall average stability is still modest at 34.4%. Notably, through this comprehensive evaluation, we newly identify 28,119 crystal structures that are fully phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone. These structures constitute substantial and reliable pool of candidate materials for subsequent materials design and discovery, highlighting both the promise of generative models in expanding the known materials space and their current limitations in guaranteeing dynamical stability."

            "title": "Systematic Evaluation of Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation Models",
            "content": "In this work, we employed 6 crystal generative modelsincluding the LLM-based CrystaLLM [18]; the graph-neural-networkenhanced diffusion models MatterGen [1], DiffCSP [7], and InvDesFlowAL [9]; the flow-matching model CrystalFlow [8]; and the space-group-controlled CrystalFormer [13] (covering variants trained on different datasets)to generate total of 221,000 novel crystalline materials (Figure 1). After generation, we removed duplicates with respect to each models training set and performed post-processing to correct malformed CIF files. Structural relaxations were then carried out for the remaining crystals, of which 108,843 converged successfully. Subsequently, we conducted full phonon-spectrum calculations on the relaxed structures with MatterSim [29] coupled to Phonopy [42, 43], which identified 28,119 crystals as dynamically stable, yielding stability ratio of 25.83%. Our systematic evaluation demonstrates that achieving dynamical stability remains significant challenge for all current crystal generative models. To ensure fair comparability across different generative models, we adopt the ratio of dynamically stable structures as unified evaluation metric. Specifically, this ratio is defined as the number of phonon-stable crystals (i.e., those without imaginary phonon modes) divided by the number of successfully relaxed structures. This metric effectively eliminates biases arising from differences in novelty, CIF compliance rates, and relaxation success rates among models. Furthermore, our experiments show that the stability ratio produced by generative model converges once the sample size exceeds approximately 4,000, with the remaining uncertainty being sufficiently small to avoid affecting the performance ranking reported in this study (Detailed convergence analysis of the dynamical stability rate and summary of crystal generation and stability statistics are provided in the Supplementary Information). Except for CrystaLLM, all models in the figure exceed this convergence threshold in terms of phonon-calculated samples. 3 As shown in Figure 1, the three models with the highest dynamical stability are MatterGen (41.0%), InvDesFlow-AL (38.4%), and CrystalFormer (34.4%). All of these models were pre-trained on large-scale, high-quality crystal databases such as Alex20. In contrast, models trained solely on smaller datasets, such as MP20for example, CrystalFlowexhibit significantly lower stability ratios (only 16.7%). Notably, the stability ratio of InvDesFlow-AL is approximately 130% higher than that of CrystalFlow. These results indicate that pre-training on large, high-quality datasets can substantially enhance the performance of generative models in predicting crystal dynamical stability. noteworthy point is that CrystalFlow exhibits the fastest generation speed among all models. As shown in Table 1, detailed comparison will be provided later. In terms of model architecture, MatterGen employs GemNet-based [44] diffusion generative framework, whereas InvDesFlow-AL is built on the DiffCSP-Ab-Initio-Generation approach using EGNN [45]. Both are diffusion-based models, with their performance ranking first and second, further highlighting the notable advantage of diffusion frameworks for crystal generation tasks. At the data representation level, MatterGen uses Cartesian coordinates (atomic positions), while the DiffCSP series employs fractional coordinates. This difference may affect model performance when scaling to supercells: Cartesian coordinates preserve the actual interatomic distances, whereas fractional coordinates change relative to the cell size, introducing physical inconsistency that could contribute to performance differences. In addition, MatterGen utilizes D3PM [46], specifically designed for discrete data, which may also be an important factor in its superior performance. Moreover, CrystalFormer ranks third and achieves relatively good performance by constraining crystal generation in manner that aligns better with physical intuition. However, this approach reduces novelty, as the strong constraints make it difficult to generate low-symmetry yet potentially stable materials. detailed discussion is provided in Figure 2. Detailed statistics on crystal generation, structural relaxation, and dynamical stability for all evaluated generative models are summarized in Table 1 in the Supplementary Materials. In this test, CrystaLLM achieved dynamical stability ratio of only 3.0%, ranking last. It should be noted that although the model supports unconditional generation, the generative quality can degrade significantly in the absence of effective prompts due to the inherent next-token prediction mechanism of large language models. To ensure fair comparison, we retained its unconditional generation mode, producing total of 16,000 crystals. After post-processing, only 2,074 structures were valid, of which 1,951 converged successfully, and ultimately only 58 were dynamically stable. Although the effective test sample size did not reach 4,000, the resulting uncertainty is insufficient to affect the final ranking. These results also indirectly indicate that, for the current task, LLM-based generative methods still lag significantly behind architectures such as graph neural networks. Dynamical Stability Analysis of Space-Group-Constrained Crystal Generation This section analyzes the dynamical stability of crystal structures generated by space group constrained generative model. We employed CrystalFormer [13] (Alex20) to generate total of 40,000 crystal structures, with their space-group distribution matched to that of the MP20 training set. After removing structures overlapping with MP20, 8,986 unique crystals were retained for further relaxation and phonon calculations, among which 8,642 successfully completed the phonon calculations. As shown in Figure 2(a), the generated crystals exhibit distribution across the seven crystal systems that is highly consistent with the Materials Project dataset. Among the 8,642 structures with successful phonon calculations, 2,969 were identified as dynamically stable, corresponding to stability ratio of approximately 34%. The elemental composition distribution (Figure 2(b)) shows that ternary and quaternary compounds account for more than half of the generated materials, in agreement with the statistical trends observed in the Materials Project. 4 Figure 1: Systematic Evaluation of Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation Models. (a) Workflow of this study. Eight generative models (CrystaLLM, MatterGen, DiffCSP, InvDesFlow-AL, CrystalFlow, CrystalFormer, etc.) were used to generate total of 221,000 novel structures. After removing duplicates and post-processing for CIF validity, full phonon-spectrum calculations were performed using MatterSim combined with Phonopy on 108,843 successfully relaxed crystals. In total, 28,119 structures were found to be dynamically stable, corresponding to an overall stability ratio of 25.83%. (b) Based on the systematic phonon-spectrum evaluation of over 10,000 materials by Miguel A. L. Marques et al., we employed MatterSim-v1which attains DFT-level accuracy with an average error smaller than the difference between PBE and PBEsol functionalsas the unified potential for all subsequent phonon calculations, ensuring consistency in evaluation standards. (c) Key results and model performance comparison. All generated models face challenges in achieving dynamical stability. The top three models are MatterGen (41.0%), InvDesFlow-AL (38.4%), and CrystalFormer (34.4%), all of which benefited from pretraining on large, stable datasets such as Alex20. In contrast, models trained on smaller datasets such as MP20e.g., CrystalFlow (16.7%)show significantly lower performance. The LLM-based CrystaLLM (3.0%) performs the worst, highlighting its current disadvantage relative to architectures such as graph neural networks for this task. 5 Figure 2: Dynamical Stability Analysis of Space-Group-Constrained Crystal Generation. (a) Distribution of the generated crystal structures across the seven crystal systems and their dynamical stability ratios (dark blue: dynamically stable; purple: containing imaginary modes). The cubic system exhibits the highest stability (49.2%), whereas the triclinic system shows the lowest (17%). (b) Distribution of the number of elemental components in the generated materials, where ternary and quaternary compounds account for more than half of the dataset, consistent with the trend observed in MP20. (c) Tetragonal structure: Na2Li3CdSb (d) Trigonal structure: TmThpGeRhq2 (e) Monoclinic structure: CapSm2Snq3 (f)(h) Phonon spectra corresponding to (c)(e). Na2Li3CdSb and TmThpGeRhq2 exhibit pronounced imaginary phonon modes, indicating dynamical instability, whereas CapSm2Snq3 shows no imaginary modes and is thus dynamically stable. These examples illustrate the ability of CrystalFormer to generate materials with complex chemistries, while also highlighting the remaining challenges in ensuring dynamical stability. They underscore the importance of incorporating explicit stability constraints or performing posterior stability screening within the generation pipeline. The dynamical stability ratio varies considerably among different crystal systems: cubic structures show the highest stability ratio (49.2%), followed by hexagonal (35.8%), trigonal (35.4%), tetragonal (35.0%), orthorhombic (32.6%), and monoclinic systems (26.5%), while triclinic structures exhibit 6 the lowest stability ratio at only 17%. These results suggest possible correlation between structural symmetry and dynamical stability: high-symmetry crystal systems such as cubic tend to exhibit higher stability ratios, whereas low-symmetry systems such as triclinic show markedly reduced stability. This trend may be related to the comparatively smoother potential energy landscapes associated with high-symmetry structures. Moreover, the elemental distribution of the generated materials closely matches that of the real dataset, indicating that the model achieves good coverage of chemical compositional diversity. Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in the dynamical stability of the generated structures. It is also noteworthy that, relative to generative models without space-group constraintssuch as InvDesFlow-AL [9] and DiffCSP [7]the spacegrouprestricted model exhibits significantly reduced novelty, reflecting the inherent limitations imposed by symmetry constraints on the generative space. Figures 2(c)(e) present three representative crystal structures generated by CrystalFormer: (c) tetragonal Na2Li3CdSb compound, (d) trigonal TmThpGeRhq2 compound, and (e) monoclinic CapSm2Snq3 compound. Their corresponding phonon spectra are shown in Figures 2(f)(h). The phonon results indicate that both Na2Li3CdSb and TmThpGeRhq2 exhibit pronounced imaginary frequencies across multiple phonon branches, signaling strong dynamical instabilities and suggesting that these structures may reside near saddle points or shallow extrema on the potential energy landscape. In contrast, the phonon spectrum of CapSm2Snq3 shows no imaginary modes throughout the Brillouin zone, demonstrating robust dynamical stability. The extensive imaginary modes observed in the first two structures may originate from unfavorable bonding configurations, such as excessively short interatomic distances leading to strong repulsive interactions, or local coordination environments that cannot be dynamically sustained. These case studies clearly illustrate the dual nature of the current generative model: while it can construct chemically complex structures that relax to energetically reasonable configurations, many of these structures still face significant dynamical challenges. This highlights that energy-based criteria alone are insufficient for crystal generation tasks and underscores the necessity of incorporating explicit dynamical stability constraints or performing systematic post-generation screening. Dynamical Stability Analysis of Property-Constrained Crystal Generation This section presents functional materials generation using the band-gapconditioned MatterGen model. To ensure statistical significance, we predetermined that each band-gap condition should yield at least 4,000 unique crystals for stability evaluation. In total, 56,000 crystals were generated: 16,000 samples for Eg 1.5 eV, and 10,000 samples each for Eg 0.5 eV, 2.5 eV, 3.5 eV, and 4.5 eV. After removing structures overlapping with the MP20 training set, 33,210 crystals were subjected to phonon calculations to assess their dynamical stability. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the dynamical stability exhibits clear dependence on the target band-gap conditions. The Eg 4.5 eV condition shows the lowest stability: only 617 out of 5,340 evaluated samples are dynamically stable (11.6%). In contrast, the Eg 0.5 eV condition yields the highest stability, with 1,523 stable structures among 6,524 samples (23.5%). The stability ratios for the remaining conditions are as follows: 15.3% for Eg 1.5 eV (1,448 stable out of 9,478), and 13.3% for both Eg 2.5 eV and 3.5 eV (816 stable out of 6,133 and 763 stable out of 5,735, respectively). Overall, the dynamical stability in bandgapconditioned functional materials generation remains relatively low. Even with the advanced fine-tuned MatterGen framework, the overall stability ratio reaches only 15.6%. This indicates that relying on conventional first-principles packages such as Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) or the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) for subsequent phonon calculations would incur substantial computational cost, posing challenges for practical large-scale deployment. From the elemental composition distribution (Fig. 3(b)), we observe that, under the band7 Figure 3: Dynamical Stability Analysis of Property-Constrained Crystal Generation. (a) Dynamical stability ratios of generated materials under different band-gap constraints. Among the 33,210 structures subjected to phonon analysis, the Eg 4.5 eV condition yields the lowest stability (11.6%), whereas Eg 0.5 eV yields the highest (23.5%). The stabilities for the other settings are 15.3% for Eg 1.5 eV and 13.3% for both Eg 2.5 eV and Eg 3.5 eV. Overall, the stability rate under band-gap conditioning remains low (15.6%), implying that subsequent phonon validation with QE or VASP incurs considerable computational cost and poses challenges for large-scale applications.

All three structures exhibit pronounced imaginary (negative) frequencies across multiple phonon branches, indicating strong dynamical instabilities in their current configurations. gap constraint, ternary and quaternary compounds account for more than 50% of the generated materials. This trend closely aligns with the statistical patterns found in the Materials Project database, indicating that the model maintains reasonable exploration of chemical space in controlled-generation tasks. In addition, Fig. 3(c)(e) illustrates three representative crystal structures generated by MatterGenZnCu(BO2)2, Ba8As3I4Br, and NdCuAsOwith target band gap of Eg 0.5 eV. Their corresponding phonon spectra are shown in Fig. 3(f)(h). The phonon calculations reveal pronounced imaginary (negative) frequencies across multiple phonon branches for all three materials, indicating strong dynamical instabilities in their current structural configurations. 8 Figure 4: Elemental distribution heatmap of dynamically stable crystals. The heatmap illustrates the chemical element distribution of 28,119 newly discovered crystal structures with phonon (dynamical) stability generated by the crystal generation model. Each element is colored according to its occurrence frequency in the stable crystal set, with darker colors indicating higher frequencies. The analysis shows that oxygen (O) is the most prevalent element (10,272 occurrences), followed by lithium (Li, 5,792) and fluorine (F, 5,236), whereas noble gas elements appear only rarely. This distribution clearly indicates that current generative models tend to predict stable compounds containing chemically active elements, in good agreement with established chemical intuition. To facilitate further analyses of structural reliability and potential properties, we will release all phonon calculations and optimized structures for the full set of 33,210 generated materials, providing comprehensive benchmark for subsequent validation and methodological developments.The statistics of structural relaxation and dynamical stability stratified by different band-gap ranges are summarized in Table 2 in the Supplementary Materials."

As shown in Table 2, we report each models throughput for single generation task (note: Generated Items refers to the number of structures used in this speed test, not the final number used for phonon calculations). To ensure fair comparison across architectures and memory usage, the generation speeds are normalized to an equivalent batch size of 200. All generation tasks, except for CrystalFormer, were performed on single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. The normalized inference throughput clearly reveals substantial differences in generation efficiency among the models. CrystalFlow demonstrates the highest performance, with an equivalent generation speed of 333.3 crystals per minute, significantly outperforming all other models. InvDesFlow-AL and DiffCSP form the second tier, with normalized speeds of 48.0 and 45.4 crystals per minute, respectively. CrystaLLM achieves 42.3 crystals per minute. MatterGen and CrystalFormer exhibit the lowest throughput, with equivalent speeds of only 13.2 and 12.0 crystals per minute; the slower speed of CrystalFormer is likely due to the use of its CPU version in our tests. In summary, while maintaining both novelty and stability of the generated materials, CrystalFlow demonstrates outstanding generation efficiency, exceeding the slowest model by more than an order of magnitude. This superior throughput provides critical advantage for large-scale virtual screening and iterative optimization of crystal structures using generative models. As shown in Table 2, the compared models encompass two mainstream architectures: GNNbased crystal generative models and Transformer-based sequence models, with parameter counts ranging widely from lightweight 4.8M to large-scale 53.7M, reflecting diverse model capacities and design philosophies. In terms of architectural distribution, GNNs dominate, consistent with their natural suitability for modeling the periodic graph structures of crystals. Among them, MatterGen, with 53.7M parameters, is the largest model in this comparison, reflecting its design focus on high expressive capacity. CrystalFlow, another representative GNN model, has moderate size of 20.9M parameters, while InvDesFlow-AL and DiffCSP share compact GNN architecture with 12.3M parameters each.

            "content": "In practical applications of crystal generative models, different architectures exhibit notable differences in terms of novel material discovery and computational friendliness. For instance, the symmetry-constrained CrystalFormer shows significant reduction in novelty: in one generation experiment, although 20,000 crystals were produced, only about 5,000 unique chemical formulas were obtained. This indicates that exploring new chemical spaces with such models requires generating substantially larger number of samples to obtain sufficient novel materials. In contrast, the large language model-based CrystaLLM frequently encounters file parsing failures during generation, with failure rates reaching up to 90% in severe cases, likely related to prompt design, highlighting practical limitations of this approach. Conventional equivariant graph neural network models such as MatterGen, DiffCSP, and InvDesFlow-AL achieve better novelty, but the generated structures often exhibit significantly reduced symmetry, which can lead to increased computational difficulty or instability in subsequent DFT calculations. Overall, there is trade-off between novel material discovery and computational tractability across different generative architectures, and model selection should be guided by the specific research objectives."

Although recent uMLIPs have demonstrated near-DFT accuracy in energies, forces, and structural relaxations, their performance on second-order response properties such as phonons has long lacked systematic validation. recent large-scale benchmark [41] conducted by Miguel A. L. Marques and co-workers demonstrated that, among seven state-of-the-art uMLIPs, MatterSim-v1 delivers the highest accuracy across key phonon-related propertiesincluding phonon frequencies, phonon DOS, free energy, and heat capacitywith errors even smaller than those arising from the choice of different DFT functionals (e.g., PBE versus PBEsol). Moreover, it achieves an accuracy of approximately 95% in classifying dynamical stability. Traditional DFT phonon calculations require extensive force-constant evaluations and are therefore prohibitively expensive for high-throughput screening at the scale of tens of thousands of materials. Given the validated accuracy and efficiency 11 of MatterSim-v1, we adopt this model to perform large-scale phonon and dynamical-stability evaluations of the generated structures, enabling reliable and efficient stability screening at unprecedented scale. Generating target functional materials is crucial step in the inverse design of materials. However, prior to achieving desired attributes, generative models must ensure that synthesized materials inherently exhibit fundamental crystalline characteristics, including periodicity, symmetry, interatomic interactions, and chemically reasonable stoichiometry. To this end, we propose pretrained crystal generation model. In the following, we will introduce the data representation, model architecture, and training method required for this model. We developed high-throughput phonon calculation workflow based on Phonopy and the MatterSimv1 universal machine learning interatomic potential. Crystal structure files (CIF, POSCAR/CONTCAR, etc.) were first converted to PhonopyAtoms objects using custom batch script, and 2 ˆ 2 ˆ 2 supercells were generated to produce compressed phonopy.yaml.bz2 input files. Phonon calculations were then performed using MatterSim-v1 for both geometry relaxation and force constant evaluation. Specifically, initial structures were reconstructed from the reference Phonopy files and optimized with the FIRE algorithm while preserving crystal symmetry (force convergence criterion: 0.005 eV/Å). Displaced supercells (0.01 Å) were generated by Phonopy, and atomic forces were computed using MatterSim-v1, corrected for translational drift, and used to construct and symmetrize the force constant matrices. High-symmetry paths were automatically generated using Seekpath, and phonon band structures were obtained via Fourier interpolation. Dynamical stability was assessed by checking for imaginary modes (threshold ă 1 ˆ 103 THz). This high-throughput workflow enables the dynamical stability assessment of tens of thousands of structures, providing an efficient and reliable basis for evaluating phonon properties of generative-model-derived crystals."

            "content": "Figure 5 illustrates the convergence of the dynamical stability rate for various crystal generative models as function of the number of tested samples. This indicates that when the sample size exceeds approximately 4,000, the estimation error of the stability rate becomes sufficiently small, and further increasing the number of samples has negligible impact on the ranking of the models. Although the effective test sample size for CrystaLLM is slightly below this threshold, the error range is still insufficient to alter its final ranking. This analysis provides quantitative support for the comparison of dynamical stability in the main text, ensuring the reliability and fairness of the model performance evaluation."

For each model, the table lists the number of structures that successfully converged during relaxation, the number of dynamically stable crystals identified through phonon calculations, the number of crystals successfully generated via the input scripts, the count of unique CIF files after removing duplicates, and the total number of crystals originally generated. This comprehensive overview provides quantitative comparison of the performance 17 of different models in terms of generation success, structural relaxation, and dynamical stability, offering valuable reference for further analysis and discussion in the main text.

To ensure feasibility for subsequent relaxation and phonon calculations, the generated crystals were first filtered to remove duplicates and invalid CIF files. If the resulting set exceeded 10,000 crystals, random subset of 10,000 was selected for relaxation; otherwise, all available crystals were used for phonon calculations. Notably, InvDesFlow-AL-Alex20 and MatterGen-Alex20 represent special test cases with substantially larger generation counts, designed to investigate the sample size required for the convergence of dynamical stability estimates. Experiments showed that stability ratios converge reliably with approximately 4,000 samples, making further increases unnecessary for subsequent analyses. Since InvDesFlow-AL-MP20 and DiffCSP-MP20 share the same model architecture and MP20 training set, no systematic difference in data distribution is expected. The dynamical stability ratio of InvDesFlow-AL-MP20 reported in the main text is therefore estimated by randomly sampling 8,000 structures from the 9,163 DiffCSP-MP20 samples with completed dynamical stability evaluations and averaging over five independent trials, which matches the sample size while reducing statistical fluctuations and ensuring fair and robust comparison between models."
