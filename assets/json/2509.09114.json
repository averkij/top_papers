            "content": "CIKM 25, November 1014, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea Kelin Ren, Chan-Yang Ju, and Dong-Ho Lee real-world recommendation scenarios. The increasing popularity of user-generated content and high-dimensional multimedia data makes it not only desirable but also necessary to efficiently and effectively model cross-modal relationships for next-generation recommendation systems. In recent years, multimodal recommendation methods based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved good results, mainly because GCNs can effectively capture complex interactive information and semantic relationships between users and items [16, 26, 27]. The classic Multi-View Graph Convolutional Network (MGCN) [30] builds collaboration graph between users and items through feature mapping of different modes, thereby better reflecting the relationship between users and items [30]. Despite notable progress, existing multimodal recommendation methods still suffer from several limitations. In the feature extraction stage, many models rely on static linear projections or simplistic fusion techniques, which limit their ability to capture fine-grained semantic correspondence between visual and textual modalities. Models like Bootstrap Multimodal Matching (BM3) [35] and Self-supervised Learning for Multimedia Recommendation (SLMRec) [23] introduce contrastive objectives or local fusion, yet typically lack global constraints on modality-level representation distributions, leading to semantic misalignment. Moreover, graph-based approaches such as Local and Global Graph Learning for Multimodal Recommendation (LGMRec) [7] utilize modality-specific graphs to model preferences, but still struggle with the distribution shift across modalities [1] and the noise introduced by high-dimensional features [29]. These limitations hinder the effectiveness and generalization of multimodal recommendation systems in large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention (MAMBARec) for multimodal recommendations. The model is designed to achieve more efficient and accurate feature fusion and alignment. Specifically, this study introduces three key components to enhance multimodal feature alignment: In order to improve the accuracy of local feature alignment, we propose Dilated REfinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolution to capture modal feature information at different scales, and combines channel and spatial attention mechanisms to adaptively highlight key features. The DREAM module can effectively expand the receptive field without increasing the computational burden, allowing the model to focus on fine-grained local interactions and broader context dependencies at the same time, which is critical to modeling fine preferences in heterogeneous modal spaces. Moreover, in order to effectively enforce the consistency of the global distribution of modal characteristics, we introduce the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss function [6] into the recommendation area. By using the Gaussian kernel function to explicitly restrict the consistency of modal feature distribution, the quality of feature fusion is significantly improved. Finally, in order to solve the memory consumption problem caused by high-dimensional characteristics, we designed novel memory optimization strategy. By introducing configurable dimension reduction factors and two-stage feature conversion mechanism, this strategy significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining high-quality feature representations. This ensures that MAMBARec remains scalable and computationally efficient, allowing it to be deployed in large-scale recommendation environments without sacrificing performance. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed method. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose an innovative DREAM module that significantly enhances local feature alignment through multi-scale extended convolution and dual attention mechanisms. We also introduce the MMD loss function into the recommendation system to reduce modal discrepancies and enhance the models generalization, by enforcing consistency in the global distribution of modal features. Furthermore, we designed and implemented flexible and efficient memory optimization strategy to effectively reduce the memory requirements of high-dimensional modal features and improve the actual deployment capabilities of the model."

            "content": "The advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has presented new opportunities for multimodal recommendation systems. LightGCN [10] introduces simplified graph convolution framework focused on neighborhood aggregation, which efficiently models high-order user-item relationships. The Multimodal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) [27] further advances this by constructing interaction graphs for each modality and fusing their graph embeddings. While this fusion improves recommendation performance, it may amplify modality-specific noise. GRCN [26] addresses this by refining the graph through gating mechanisms to suppress noisy interactions. However, existing GCN-based models still struggle with accommodating heterogeneous semantic granularities across modalities, leading to information dilution and over-smoothing in dense graphs [14]. Recent work in multimodal recommendation has further explored self-supervised learning and fine-grained fusion mechanisms. SLMRec [23] introduces cross-modal self-supervised tasks and hierarchical contrastive learning framework to enhance the robustness of modal representations.

FREEDOM [34] reduces memory consumption by freezing the item similarity graph and pruning user interaction graphs, aiming to improve training stability and resource efficiency. LGMRec [7] introduces localglobal modal graph learning strategy that models both modality-specific user interests and shared cross-modal preferences, in order to alleviate interference between modalities. Meanwhile, MGCN [30] leverages users historical behavior to guide the preprocessing and refinement of modal features and employs multi-view graph convolution to facilitate more fine-grained fusion of multimodal information. While these approaches represent important progress in multimodal recommendation, they often overlook semantic consistency across modalities and coordination of representation distributions. Few approaches explicitly integrate local feature alignment and distributional consistency in unified manner, which is crucial for achieving robust and generalized cross-modal fusion. In this study, we propose to jointly model local semantic correspondences and global distributional consistency from multimodal alignment perspective to achieve more consistent and efficient recommendation systems."

The DREAM module contains five parallel convolution operation branches to extract multi-scale features, which are then weighted and fused by simultaneously applying channel and spatial attention mechanisms to the fused feature map. 4.1.1 Multi-scale feature extraction. These five branches consist of 1 1 convolution branch, three dilated convolution branches with increasing dilation rates, and global average pooling branch. The first branch applies 1 1 convolution to extract fine-grained local features with minimal computational cost and without expanding the receptive field. This enables lightweight channel-wise transformation while preserving high-resolution spatial details. Branches 2 to 4 employ 33 dilated convolutions with dilation rates of 6, 12, and 18, respectively. These configurations enlarge the receptive field to capture mediumand long-range contextual information while maintaining the spatial resolution through appropriate padding. Branch 5 performs global average pooling over the entire spatial dimension, followed by 1 1 convolution to project the global representation into the desired number of channels. The resulting 1 1 feature map is then upsampled to 𝐻 𝑊 via bilinear interpolation to align with the spatial dimensions of the other branches and provide global semantic context. Let the output feature maps of the five branches be denoted as 𝐹1, 𝐹2, 𝐹3, 𝐹4 and 𝐹5 R𝐻 𝑊 𝐶𝑖 . There are concatenated along the channel dimension to obtain the fused feature map: 𝐹 = Concat𝑐 (𝐹1, 𝐹2, 𝐹3, 𝐹4, 𝐹5), (1) where Concat𝑐 denotes concatenation along the channel dimension. The resulting fused representation 𝐹 R𝐻 𝑊 𝐶 integrates both local detail and global context information, where 𝐶 = (cid:205)5 𝐶𝑖 . 𝑖=1 4.1.2 Channel attention mechanism. In order to adaptively enhance important channels, DREAM introduced channel attention module to the fused feature map 𝐹 . Apply global average pooling to the feature map 𝐹 to obtain channel compression vector 𝑧 R𝐶 11 (if there are 𝐶 channels after splicing). Then, enter 𝑧 into the two fully connected layers in turn. The first fully connected layer reduces the channel dimension (using the ReLU activation function 𝛿 () to 𝐶 /𝑟 ), and the second fully connected layer restores the dimension to 𝐶 and outputs channel weight vector 𝑀𝑐 R𝐶 11. The above process can be expressed as: 𝑀𝑐 = 𝜎 (𝑊2 (𝛿 (𝑊1 (𝑧)))) , (2) where 𝑊1 and 𝑊2 are the weight matrices of the fully connected layer, and 𝛿, 𝜎 denote the ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions respectively. The value range of each element of the obtained channel attention weight 𝑀𝑐 is [0, 1], which indicates the importance of the corresponding channel. Finally, the weight 𝑀𝑐 is multiplied back onto the fused feature map to achieve channel-by-channel feature recalibration: 𝐹𝑐 = 𝐹 𝑀𝑐, (3) where the symbol denotes element-wise multiplication for each channel. After channel attention is enhanced, the feature map 𝐹𝑐 is enlarged on key channels to suppress unimportant channel information. Spatial attention mechanism. The DREAM module applies 4.1.3 spatial attention mechanisms to highlight key spatial locations. Specifically, the fused feature 𝐹 is pooled in the channel dimension to obtain two-dimensional feature map 𝑃 R1𝐻 𝑊 . Here we use an average per channel method, 𝑃 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 1 𝐹 (𝑐, 𝑖, 𝑗), and 𝐶 calculate the average response at each spatial location (𝑖, 𝑗). Next, 𝑃 is linearly transformed using convolution of 1 1, and then normalized through Sigmoid function to get spatial attention weight graph 𝑀𝑠 R1𝐻 𝑊 : (cid:205)𝐶 𝑐= 𝑀𝑠 = 𝜎 (cid:0)𝑓 11 (𝑃)(cid:1) , (4) where 𝑓 11 denotes the 1 1 convolution operator, and 𝜎 maps the result to the [0, 1] interval. Each position (𝑖, 𝑗) of 𝑀𝑠 corresponds to spatial weight, which indicates the importance of the position. This weight map is then expanded to match the number of channels in 𝐹 (copied to all channels at each position) and multiplied elementwise with the original fused feature map: 𝐹𝑠 = 𝐹 𝑀𝑠, (5) this produces feature map 𝐹𝑠 with enhanced spatial attention. After this operation, 𝐹𝑠 is enhanced at important spatial locations, suppressing the influence of background or irrelevant areas. 4.1.4 Attention fusion. After obtaining the channel enhancement feature 𝐹𝑐 and the spatial enhancement feature 𝐹𝑠 , the DREAM module fuses the two features by performing an element-by-element maximization operation, thereby making full use of these two types of attention information. Specifically, we perform an element-byelement maximum operation on 𝐹𝑐 and 𝐹𝑠 (denoted as M) to merge them: 𝑌 = (𝐹𝑐, 𝐹𝑠 ), (6) where (𝑎, 𝑏) means selecting the larger of the two input tensors 𝑎 and 𝑏 element by element. For each position in each channel, the more responsive one of the channel attention branches or the spatial attention branches is adaptively selected as the output. After the DREAM module performs multi-scale feature refinement and attention-weighted alignment, more significant and accurate local feature information is included."

The Gaussian kernel function we use in this work is defined as follows: (cid:18) (cid:19) 𝑘 (𝑣, 𝑡) = exp 𝑣 𝑡 2 2𝜎 , (9) where 𝜎 is kernel bandwidth hyperparameter, which is used to adjust the sensitivity of distance between features to similarity. By minimizing the above-mentioned MMD loss, the distance between image modality and text modality in the overall distribution can be effectively shortened, thereby achieving global semantic alignment. To further enhance the consistency of representations, we introduced InfoNCE comparative learning loss as supplement. It enhances the similarity between matching pairs of graphic features and suppresses the similarity between non-matching pairs through comparative learning, which is expressed as follows: LInfoNCE = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 log exp (sim(𝑣𝑖, 𝑡𝑖 )/𝜏) 𝑗=1 exp (cid:0)sim(𝑣𝑖, 𝑡 𝑗 )/𝜏 (cid:1) (cid:205)𝑁 , (10) where sim(, ) is the dot product of the normalized feature vector, and 𝜏is the temperature hyperparameter. Ultimately, the overall loss of the global distribution alignment module consists of weighted combination of the two components: Lalign = 𝜆mmd LMMD + 𝜆cl LInfoNCE, (11) where 𝜆mmd and 𝜆cl denote the weight coefficients of these two losses, and their values are specified by the model configuration hyperparameter, respectively. With this joint optimization strategy, we achieved alignment and fusion of cross-modal semantic representations at the global distribution level."

            "content": "(1) MambaRec performs significantly better than general recommendation models and multimodal recommendation models. Specifically, the core advantage of our model lies in its multi-level modal alignment and fusion mechanism. At the local level, the model introduces dilated refinement attention module (DREAM), which enhances fine-grained representations of image and text modalities. At the global level, the model explicitly aligns image and text distributions using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) constraint, which effectively alleviates cross-modal semantic bias. In addition, through channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms, our model achieves importance assessment and adaptive fusion of modal features, while the designed dimensional compression mechanism significantly reduces computing and memory overhead while maintaining representation capabilities. As result, MambaRec performed better than the existing baseline model on all three datasets. (2) Most benchmark models suffer from noise interference and insufficient extraction of effective information when processing modal features.

Although MMGCN [27], GRCN [26], and other graph neural network methods integrate graph structure and modal features, they use static or linear fusion strategies, which makes it difficult to effectively filter out noise information. Some methods attempt to alleviate the problems faced. SLMRec [23] enhances modal discrimination through self-supervision tasks, and FREEDOM [34]introduces graph structure freezing strategy to reduce error propagation. Problems of noise interference and insufficient information extraction still exist. In contrast, our proposed MambaRec model adaptively filters noise and enhances key modal features by introducing DREAM module that combines multi-scale convolution and dual attention mechanisms. Our method has achieved the best recommendation performance. (3) Modal alignment can indirectly alleviate the problems of noise interference between modes and insufficient information extraction. Although MGCN [30] introduces multimodal information into collaborative modeling, it is difficult to effectively suppress modal noise and extract fine-grained semantics due to the use of linear projection and static fusion strategies. In contrast, our method introduces local feature enhancement and global distribution alignment mechanisms. The DREAM module enhances critical information and dynamically suppresses redundant features, while MMD loss reduces cross-modal distribution differences and mitigate noise interference at the representation level. The two work together to demonstrate stronger anti-interference capabilities and optimal recommendation performance. Figure 3: Ablation studies on the proposed MambaRec"

The results are shown in figure. 3: The complete MambaRec model performed well on all evaluation metrics and datasets. In contrast, once the modal alignment module is removed, model performance drops significantly. The performance degradation is even more pronounced in the absence of local modal alignment module, indicating that the module is critical in characterizing modal details and capturing local associations. Although the global alignment module focuses on overall semantic alignment, its absence can also weaken the fusion effect. 5.3.2 Effect of Modalities. In order to further evaluate the impact of each modality, we conducted experiments under different input conditions: text input covers text modal content, visual input contains visual modal related information, and full input combines both text and visual modalities. As shown in Table 3, integrating information from text and visual modalities always leads to optimal performance. In contrast, if the model relies on only single modality, its recommendation effectiveness will be reduced to varying degrees. This phenomenon reflects the complementary characteristics of multimodal information in describing user preferences. Text modalities can better reflect the semantic attributes of items, while visual modalities intuitively present the appearance characteristics of items, and they have their own advantages in different usage scenarios."

We compared Recall@20 performance on Baby and Sports datasets under different combinations of reduction factors and maximum mean discrepancy weight (𝜆𝑚𝑚𝑑 ), as shown in Figure. 5. The results show favorable performance region within the parameter space, with several combinations achieving comparable results. The combination of reduction factor 8 and 𝜆𝑚𝑚𝑑 = 0.15 performs consistently well on both datasets, though other nearby parameter settings also demonstrate competitive performance. Moderate compression ratios can give better results than excessive compression or almost no compression because moderate compression can remove redundant parameters and noise without serious loss of characterization capabilities. 𝜆𝑚𝑚𝑑 , which is the strength coefficient of modal alignment, also has significant impact on performance. Too small value may lead to insufficient alignment of different modal features and ineffective information fusion, while too large value may introduce irrelevant noise and reduce model discrimination capabilities. 5.4.3 Effects of Reduction Factor. To balance model performance and computing resource consumption, we examined three indicators under different compression factors for Baby and Sports datasets, namely, Recall@20, model parameter count as percentage Figure 6: Impact of Reduction Factor Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation CIKM 25, November 1014, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea of benchmark, and computation time as percentage of benchmark, as shown in Figure. 6. Experimental results demonstrate that as compression factor increases, model parameters and computation time exhibit continuous decline, while Recall@20 shows nonlinear fluctuation patterns, decreasing at moderate compression levels. Uncompressed models achieve superior performance but incur highest resource costs. Excessive compression significantly reduces parameters and time, but insufficient representation capability leads to notable performance degradation. At compression factor 8, Recall@20 reaches peak levels while reducing parameters by over 30% and significantly decreasing computation time. Model compression not only reduces resource burden, but also suppresses overfitting noise to certain extent, thereby improving generalization stability [3, 8]. It is important to choose reasonable compression factor in resource-constrained deployment scenarios [15]."

In contrast, MambaRec has more uniform embedding distribution, wide coverage and smooth kernel density estimation (KDE) [24] curve, indicating more discriminatory representation. In summary, the modal alignment mechanism not only fundamentally alleviates the semantic degradation and modal overlap problems that are easy to occur in traditional methods, but also significantly improves the overall performance of the multimodal recommendation system in terms of expression power and representation structure, which verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the MambaRec model."
