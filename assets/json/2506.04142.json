            "content": "Recently large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, achieving remarkable results across wide range of complex tasks (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). Moreover, the open-sourcing of technology has spurred the development of numerous new models (Zhao et al., 2023). In this *Equal Contribution. Corresponding authors. Figure 1: An example illustrating the core principle of our approach: we prevent the model from relying on shortcuts in contaminated regions to generate answers. This process restores the models true capabilities. context, evaluation has become increasingly critical, which plays pivotal role in shaping the future trajectory of LLM development (Guo et al., 2023). We believe that trustworthiness is currently the critical aspect to enhance in evaluation, compared to evaluating the broader capabilities of LLMs (Chang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Litschko et al., 2023). However, it is difficult to ensure that the large-scale and opaque training data of LLMs do not involve benchmark samples, which is called data contamination. Contamination can significantly affect the fairness of the evaluation (Li et al., 2024b; Tu et al., 2024). Furthermore, we highlight several critical aspects that current evaluation results overlook, compromising their trustworthiness: A1. Model behavior shortcut: End-to-end LLMs can lead to lack of transparency in the intermediate reasoning process when solving complex problems. This raises questions about whether the model has completed credible reasoning process or has taken shortcuts in reasoning, which can lead to distrust in the answers generated by LLMs in real-world complex scenarios. A2. Input format shortcut: The current benchmark has the drawback that the input format is fixed and differs from the way real-world inquiries are made. Models that are fine-tuned on the benchmarks input format (even the training set) have an advantage at evaluation, leading to higher scores, which is not fair. Data contamination can lead to models being fitted to limited benchmarks, which is key factor for aspects A1, A2 (Magar and Schwartz, 2022). To address this issue, recent researches focus on developing dynamic benchmarks to mitigate contamination (Yu et al., 2023; Jacovi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Zhu et al., 2023a). However, this strategy is resource-intensive. Besides it does not fundamentally eliminate the risk of contamination in newly released models. To alleviate the untrustworthiness caused by contamination, it is crucial to understand the impact that contamination can have on models. We hypothesize that the untrustworthiness occurs because the model overfits the benchmark when contaminated, acquiring shortcuts for input format and reasoning. We speculate that these shortcuts in the benchmark are key to our inability to trust the models real-world capabilities. Through experiments, we discover sparse set of neurons closely associated with the aforementioned shortcuts, and these shortcut neurons can be leveraged to suppress the shortcuts, as shown in 4.2. Similar findings can be supported by previous studies (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Li, 2023; Bordt et al., 2024). In this paper, we propose novel method to establish trustworthy LLM evaluation via shortcut neuron analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the principle of this approach. Recent studies have shown that transformer neurons are often closely related to specific abilities of LLMs (Geva et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2021). Therefore, we analyze shortcuts at the neuron level. Our method for identifying shortcut neurons is based on two key indicators: (1) Comparative Analysis. This involves comparing neuron activation differences between contaminated and uncontaminated models when processing the same benchmark samples. Neurons with significant activation differences are likely linked to memory shortcuts. (2) Causal Analysis. We compute the causal score by performing activation patching (Meng et al., 2022; Vig et al., 2020b; Zhang and Nanda, 2023) and analyzing its causal effects. neuron is identified as shortcut neuron if it satisfies two causal effects: (a) it restores the true scores of the contaminated model, and (b) it does not affect the normal ability of the model. In Section 4.2, we find that the shortcut neurons located above are sparse and effective, with total of about 5000. Then we use the shortcut neuron patching method to conduct trustworthy evaluation by inhibiting shortcuts. Specifically, we will use the shortcut neuron activation of the base model with same architecture to patch models under test, so as to establish trustworthy evaluation. To verify the effectiveness of our evaluation method, we conduct experiments on both LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) architectures. We fine-tune series of contaminated and uncontaminated models. First, the accuracy of the contaminated models significantly decrease under our evaluation methodology compared to the original benchmark. This indicates that our approach effectively mitigates behavioral shortcuts in the models, enhancing their trustworthiness of black-box behavior (A1). Second, we observe that even models fine-tuned on the benchmark input format, such as those trained on the GSM8K train set, also exhibit drop in accuracy. This suggests that our method can mitigate the input shortcuts, controlling for gains due to input format rather than model capability (A2). Lastly, to verify that our method targets model shortcuts without compromising general abilities, we evaluate the patched models on math benchmark MAWPS and comprehensive benchmark MMLU. The results show that no significant accuracy changes for LLMs, indicating that our approach does not negatively impact the genuine performance of LLMs. Additionally, we select two recently released trustworthy benchmarks, OpenMathInstruct-2 and MixEval, as reference benchmarks. MixEval is aligned with real user queries, catering to realworld model performance demands. For real-world application, we download series of real-world models from Hugging Face. It reveals strong linear correlation between our scores and the reference scores, with Spearman correlation coefficient exceeding 0.95. This highlights the ability of our evaluation methodology to reliably reflect real-world model performance. We also test the generalizability of our evaluation method across different benchmarks and hyperparameter settings, demonstrating its robustness. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We are the first to analyze the neuron-level mechanism by which models scores exceed its genuine capabilities after contamination, hypothesizing that this phenomenon is driven by shortcuts. We propose novel method for identifying neurons through comparative and causal analysis, isolating sparse set of neurons closely associated with shortcut reasoning. We introduce shortcut neuron patching method to enable more trustworthy evaluation by suppressing shortcuts for both input format and behavior."

This issue is particularly pronounced in the era of LLMs, which are trained on massive corpus. (Brown, 2020, Magar and Schwartz, 2022). Such contamination raises significant concerns about the validity of benchmarking studies and the generalizability of LLMs (Sainz et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024)."

            "content": "To mitigate the impact of contamination for trustworthy evaluation, recent studies have approached this challenge by proposing dynamic benchmark construction and updating protocols to minimize overlap with pre-training data (Zhu et al., 2023a, Zhu et al., 2023b). On the one hand, Yu et al., 2023 introduce dynamic evaluation framework, reshaping the static nature of benchmarks. On the other hand, benchmark data encryption and label protection have also been suggested as strategies to prevent contamination (Jacovi et al., 2023). Besides, there is also work sampling on the distribution of model outputs and removing outputs that are most likely to be affected by contamination to conduct trustworthy evaluation (Dong et al., 2024). The neuron in LLM specifically refers to activation before down projection in MLP, which has been shown to be critical for information processing (Geva et al., 2022). The activation of neuron vl is determined by its corresponding activation coefficient ml ij, which is calculated as: ml ij = σ(xl kl j) (2) where xl l, kl is the representation of token xi at layer is the j-th row of Kl in the MLP. Previous excellent work has found that transformer neurons are correlated with certain aspects of LLM capabilities (Geva et al., 2020). Therefore, recent works have studied the mechanism of LLM through LLM neurons, and various types of neurons have been discovered. For example, (Dai et al., 2021) identified \"knowledge neurons\" that appear to store factual knowledge, while (Wang et al., 2022) discovered \"skill neurons\" associated with specific linguistic skills. There are also concept neurons (Geva et al., 2022), safety neurons (Chen et al., 2024), etc. Recent works usually project neuron representations to the vocabulary space to study the mechanism and meaning of neurons (Geva et al., 2022), and verify the function of neurons through causal analysis (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024, Gurnee et al., 2024). However, they usually focus on theoretical analysis at the neuron mechanism level, but lack practical application scenarios. In this paper, we try to find shortcut neurons for contaminated models, which may be the main reason why the model scores on the contaminated benchmark are artificially high."

            "content": "In transformer-based LLMs, each layer consists of multi-head attention mechanism followed by feed-forward network (FFN), which is multilayer perceptron (MLP) (Vaswani, 2017). The FFN is defined as: FFN(x) = σ(xK + b1)V + b2 (1) where is the input to the layer, and are the weight matrices, b1 and b2 are the bias terms, and σ is non-linear activation function. Most previous works on trustworthy evaluation focus on constructing uncontaminated benchmarks. For example, some efforts create benchmarks using the most recent texts (Li et al., 2024a), while others develop dynamic benchmarks (Yu et al., 2023, Zhu et al., 2023a). However, since LLMs are continuously updated, ensuring the timeliness of these benchmarks remains significant challenge. Unlike previous works, we turn attention on the inner mechanism of models to study the origin of Figure 2: The overview of our method. We employ neuron analysis to identify regions within the model that may be overestimating its capabilities due to shortcuts. We calculate comparative and causal scores to find shortcut neurons. The former highlights the areas where there is the greatest divergence between parameters of contaminated and uncontaminated models. The latter is derived from neuron patching analysis to assess its causal impact. Subsequently, we use the located shortcut neurons to patch various models under test to obtain trustworthy evaluation results. the overestimation. We hypothesize that contamination provides the model with shortcut solution, leading to an overestimation of its abilities. We found that some neurons in the contaminated models are associated with their high scores on contaminated benchmark. We refer to these as shortcut neurons. Our proposed method identifies and patches these shortcut neurons to suppress shortcuts within the model, mitigate the effects of contamination. As illustrated in Figure 2, our approach comprises two primary phases. (1) We locate shortcut neurons using contrasting distance (3.2) and causal analysis (3.3), as detailed in Section 3.3. (2) We apply dynamic patching technique to validate the causal effects of shortcut neuron and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating the impact of data contamination, as discussed in Section 3.4."

Let denote the dataset with data contamination. We define the comparison score for the ith neuron in the lth layer on as the root mean square of the differences between the activations of models Mcon and Mun during the generation process: Sl i(M, D) = (cid:115) (cid:80) (cid:0)al xD i(xT Mcon) al i(xT Mun)(cid:1)2 (3)"

            "content": "Activation patching. Activation patching (Vig et al., 2020a) is the most prevalent method for evaluating causal effects of neurons on LLMs. Traditionally, this method has been applied to short output tasks, where the focus is on assessing how much we can restore the probability of predicting the next correct token on the corrupted input with activation patching. However, contamination occurs in various task scenarios, such as mathematics (Tu et al., 2024), coding(Matton et al., 2024), etc. The outputs of these scenarios are open ended, so dynamic patching is required. In dynamic patch, well use the activation of the patching models neurons to replace the activation of the corresponding neurons in the patched model in generation process. In detail: (1) Run patching model Mpatching on current prompt Xt and cache activations of given neurons; (2) Run Mpatched on the same prompt Xt with the activation of given neurons replaced by cached activation while the other neurons keep unchanged; (3) Predict next token xt and append it to current prompt for new one Xt+1 = Xt + xt. Repeat above steps until generation process finished. Calculate Causal Score of Neurons. neuron that is responsible for contamination or memorization should have two important features: (1) It has significant impact on the performance of the contaminated model. (2) It has as little impact on the models own capabilities as possible, which can also be characterized as having little impact on the performance of the uncontaminated model. Based on this assumption, we use dynamic patching method to calculate the causal score of each neuron. Similar to 3.2, we use the vanilla model M0 as the patching model, while Mcon and Mun as the patched models. Assume that the prompt dataset with data contamination is D, we define causal score of investigated neurons set is: CN =a(Mcon) apatch(MconM0) + 1 (a(Mun) apatch(MunM0)) (4) where a(Mcon) represent the accuracy of model Mcon on D; apatch(MconM) represent the accuracy after patched by guided model M. a(Mun) and apatch(MunM) have similar meaning. In the above formula, if the performance of Mcon is worse after the patch, CN is higher, and if the performance of Mun is worse, CN is lower."

Following prior work (Dekoninck et al., 2024), we simulate contamination by fine-tuning LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B-v0.2 to create contaminated and uncontaminated models, which are detailed in Table 1.

To verify this, we will use fine-tuned models to conduct simulation experiment. Specifically, we select GSM8K as example. For model, we test its original accuracy on GSM-i and accuracy after patching. The results of the simulation settings are presented in Table 2. Notably, the performance of contaminated models decreases significantly after patching, with an average drop of 37%, highlighting the effectiveness of shortcut neuron patching in mitigating contamination. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the uncontaminated model changes by 3% on average, demonstrating that our method has minimal impact on the reasoning ability of models. It proves that we can effectively suppress model shortcuts and improve the credibility of model behavior. We can also improve the transparency of the intermediate process of model behavior and ensure that the source of the score is the models ability. Furthermore, we select the OpenMathInstruct-2 math problem dataset (Toshniwal et al., 2024) recently released by NVIDIA as an uncontaminated benchmark as reference. Figure 4 illustrates strong positive correlation between our score and the reference score, with Spearman correlation coefficient ρ of 0.970.

Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between our evaluation scores and the MixEval scores. strong correlation between the two evaluation results is evident, indicating that the scores obtained using our method closely align with the actual capabilities of the models as perceived by users."

So we set the contaminated datasets to MAWPS and MATH to observe whether the shortcut neurons located for GSM8K still work. We also fine-tune series of models (shown in Appendix 10) and find that under the contaminated settings of MAWPS and MATH, this batch of shortcut neurons can also help us achieve the purpose of trustworthy evaluation, as shown in Table 4. Generalization across Various Hyperparameters. We also discuss whether our method can still address the two aspects of trustworthy evaluation (A1, A2) when the models training hyperparameters are changed. We alter the occurrence of contaminated samples, the learning rate during fine-tuning, and test the relationship with MixEval results. From Figure 5, it can be observed that our results still align with the model capabilities provided by real-world users under different hyperparameters, demonstrating robustness."

Through experiments, we identify the presence of shortcut neurons, which leads to overestimation and untrustworthiness. We propose method that integrates comparative and causal analysis to detect shortcut neurons. Furthermore, we introduce shortcut neuron patching technique to eliminate shortcuts. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively restores models true capabilities. Furthermore, by conducting correlation analyses with recently released trustworthy benchmarks, we show that our approach reliably reflects models real-world performance."

In the future, we will expand our research to more frameworks. (2) In simulation experiments, we used the full parameter fine-tuning method to obtain the models, instead of using pre-training. Here we assume that base models are uncontaminated, but in fact, even base models cannot completely eliminate the suspicion of contamination. However training clean model from scratch is very expensive. (3) Our experiments are mainly conducted on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, which we believe are the most representative of data contamination. In the future, we will apply the shortcut neuron patching method to other broader benchmarks to contribute to LLM evaluation. (4) We found that there are large differences in shortcut neurons under different architectures, which may affect the generalization of our method. We will further study this issue in the future."

However, good mechanism research methods may be used to influence LLMs autonomous decision-making in high-risk scenarios or even generate harmful outputs (avoiding safety alignment). Understanding the mechanism of the model does not mean that the model can be fully trusted. The safety of technological development must be guaranteed from an ethical perspective. Besides, we used AI assistants to check grammar and polish the text of the paper. But we carefully checked and made sure that the AI assistant did not change the original meaning of the article.

C.4 Different Order of Training Data To further evaluate the generalizability of our method, we randomized the order of contaminated samples during the SFT stage used to construct the contaminated models. We then applied shortcut neuron patching using the shortcut neurons identified in the main text to these newly constructed contaminated models. As shown in Table 11, our method still achieved favorable trustworthy evaluation results, effectively reducing the performance of contaminated models to normal level. C.5 Different Task Scenarios Since the experiments in the main text are all based on mathematical benchmarks, we additionally applied our method in different task scenario. Specifically, we followed the setup of KIEval (Yu et al., 2024), recent and excellent work on trustworthy evaluation, and located set of shortcut neurons on the ARC-Challenge dataset (Clark et al., 2018). We then applied our evaluation method to two types of contaminated models (both the continual pretraining phase and the SFT phase) released by KIEval and available on Hugging Face. The results, shown in Table 12, demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates contamination effects across both SFT and continual pretraining stages, enabling fair evaluation in different task domain."
