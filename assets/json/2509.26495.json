            "content": "The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become mainstream topic of discussion, and its importance is growing as such systems are deployed at scale. Despite extensive efforts over the past few years to align these models toward safe behavior (OpenAI, 2024b; Anthropic, 2025a; Google LLC, 2025), the problem remains far from solved. Even the most advanced LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks within days of their launch (Dickson, 2025; in Asia, 2025). However, these studies primarily examine general-purpose capabilities of LLMs, which are not sufficient to guarantee the safety of purpose-specific agents built on top of them. To construct such an agent, developers typically specify two aspects for the LLM: (1) policies: constraints defining the boundary between allowed (in-domain) and disallowed (out-of-domain) user queries (Figure 1), and (2) response styles: which govern the tone of responses (e.g., polite, formal, or concise). In this work, we study the capability of LLMs when instructed to adhere to purpose, which we term operational safety. Given the policies, operational safety is the ability of an LLM to accurately These authors contributed equally Corresponding author 1 Figure 1: Region of operational safety as defined by policies. general-purpose AI operates within generic safety policies (yellow circle), whereas purpose-specific assistant introduces further restrictions (cyan and purple circles), thereby narrowing the region of allowed queries, the assistants Operational Safety. On the right, we illustrate how an agent may initially refuse an OOD query, but an adversarial transformation can succeed in eliciting response. We show examples of ChatGPT-5 and Claude-Opus-4 being operationally unsafe in Figures 6 and 7. refuse out-of-domain (OOD) queries while remaining helpful to in-domain (ID) queries. To evaluate operational safety of LLMs, we propose OFFTOPICEVAL, an evaluation suite to assess operational safety of LLMs. For each LLM under evaluation, we instantiate 21 purpose-specific agents, and test each agent on its ability to refuse OOD queries (both direct and adversarially transformed) while correctly accepting ID queries. Our OFFTOPICEVAL-based evaluations span multiple families (GPT, Llama, Gemma, Qwen, Mistral, Phi) and model sizes ranging from small (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B) to medium (8B, 14B, 32B) and large (70B and 235B), encompassing total of 20 open-weight models. We show that even agents built on highly capable LLMsLlama-3.3 (70B), Qwen-3 (235B), and Gemma-3 (27B)frequently fail to reliably identify OODs. On average, models fail to detect 12.24% of direct OOD queries, and this failure rate worsens dramatically to 70.72% when the queries are adversarially transformed. In these cases, OOD queries are embedded within prompts that superficially resemble in-domain inputs, setting we refer to as adaptive OODs. Across the 20 open-weight models evaluated on OFFTOPICEVAL, we find that models frequently fail to refuse adaptive OOD queries appropriately. Importantly, we find that this problem is multilingual: refusal rates are low not only in English but also in Chinese and Hindi, three languages spanning distinct families and scripts, underscoring fundamental limitation of current LLM-based agents. We also explore measures to enhance the operational safety of LLM-based agents. While activation steering provides little benefit, we introduce prompt-based steering methods, P-ground (grounding in the models policy) and Q-ground (grounding in the query), which significantly improve OOD refusal. In particular, query-grounding achieves consistent improvements of up to 23% across families, while prompt-grounding can deliver even larger boostsup to 41% for Llama-3.3 (70B) and 27% for Qwen-3 (30B). In summary, our main contributions are: We introduce operational safety, largely overlooked aspect of LLM safety that concerns their suitability for use as purpose-specific agents. We define operational safety as balance measure of an LLM-based agents ability to accept in-domain queries while refusing out-of-domain queries. We release OFFTOPICEVAL, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring the operational safety of LLMs. For given agentic use case, the suite provides set of 3,351 OOD samples for both direct and adversarial testing. To assess the broader suitability of LLMs for agentic tasks, OFFTOPICEVAL provides 21 agent policies to convert an LLM into purpose-specific agent. The LLMs are rigorously tested on over 220K samples to provide the final operational safety score. Although operational safety is core alignment problem, we also propose mitigation strategies that ground the models behavior in the system prompt (P-ground) or in the query response (Qground). These strategies serve as initial steps toward addressing the problem, and our evaluation results provide insights for the research community to build more robust improvements in the future."

            "content": "Numerous discussions around the safety of AI systems focus on generic safety, i.e., evaluating models along axes that determine whether they might assist user in hurting themselves or others (Vidgen et al., 2024; Mazeika et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024), alongside efforts by dedicated safety evaluation groups (OWASP Foundation, 2025; Institute; MITRE, 2024) and government bodies (Government of China, 2025; EU, 2024; House, 2023; of Canada, 2025). For evaluating the safety of LLMs, prior research has demonstrated wide range of jailbreaks that can be divided into two categories. White-box attacks, which exploit access to model internals such as gradients, logits, or fine-tuning pipelines, include methods like gradient-based adversarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023), PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement) (Chao et al., 2025), AutoDAN (Zhu et al., 2023), and fine-tuningbased manipulations (ONeill et al., 2023). In contrast, black-box attacks assume only query access and rely on iterative or contextual strategies, including TAP (Tree of Attacks with Pruning) (Mehrotra et al., 2024), ReNeLLM (Generalized Nested Jailbreak Prompts) (Ding et al., 2023), adversarial suffix attacks such as GASP (Basani & Zhang, 2024). Collectively, these jailbreak strategies reveal diverse attack vectors that can force models to violate generic safety policies, highlighting the fragility of current alignment methods. However, prior work largely overlooks the safety of LLMs when deployed as agents, thereby neglecting domain-specific operational safety, necessary prerequisite for considering any system safe for deployment. In this work, with OFFTOPICEVAL, we establish foundation for systematically measuring the operational safety of LLMs. Our benchmark addresses critical gap in the AI safety landscape, one that has thus far limited the reliable adoption of LLMs across diverse use cases."

            "content": "To gauge the operational safety of current LLMs, we evaluate them along two dimensions: (1) diversity in LLM-based agents and (2) diversity in testing scenarios. We transform given LLM into task-specific agent by clearly specifying policies that partition the query space into in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD). For OOD evaluation, we use two sets of test samples: (a) Direct OODs: samples that remain fixed across all evaluations and are agent-agnostic; and (b) Adaptive OODs: samples that are built based on the agents domain of operation (policies) and thus are agent-specific. Thus, OFFTOPICEVAL comprises Direct OODs, Adaptive OODs, IDs, and their multilingual variants. Direct OOD Tests. The space of out-of-domain queries is vast, making it infeasible to test models on all possible cases. We therefore adopt practical approach by approximating this ideal, i.e. evaluating agents on OOD tests sampled from diverse domains within the OOD space. For this purpose, we use MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), which offers highly diverse and extensive collection of questions. Moreover, these are factoid multiple-choice questions (MCQs), allowing for reliable evaluation of agent responses without eliciting opinionated or abstained outputs (Kirichenko et al., 2025). To further minimize opinionated responses, we exclude categories not primarily grounded in factual knowledge (e.g., logical fallacies, miscellaneous, moral disputes, and moral scenarios). Adaptive OOD Tests. To further probe the OOD space and make test samples more challenging, we employ prompt laundering. It performs an adversarial transformation of disallowed OOD test sample into superficially in-domain form while preserving the original query intent1. Let So denote the space of all OOD samples and Do So the set of direct OODs. We define prompt laundering as transformation : Do Dt xt := (x) So) that preserves query content. Formally, s.t. Q(x) = Q(xt), (prompt laundering) (Dt where Q() denotes the query content of test sample, defined as the minimal information that must be preserved for the sample to yield the same response. For the transformation, we employ Llama70B model prompted with instructions to convert into according to specified transformation style, which includes broad details of the agents policies. While it is difficult to precisely extract the query content of prompt, we analyze d(x) = Q(x) Q(xt) as proxy for the equivalence condition. To compute d(x), we use Mistral-24B to validate the quality of adaptive samples. Specifically, we instruct it to extract the core content, perform the 1While it is not necessary condition for transformed sample to be OOD, it is sufficient condition ensuring the transformation does not convert the OOD sample to ID. comparison, and output score of 0 if the content differs and 1 if the query content matches exactly. Since LLM-based judges can sometimes lead to false positives, we additionally compare and yt for cases where both and xt produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs), in order to more reliably assess response equivalence. We therefore redefine the equivalent condition d(x, xt) = 0 and yt = y, (equivalence condition) where d(x, xt) {0, 1} denotes the content score provided by the judge. In our evaluations, the transformed samples xt achieved an average content score of d(x, xt) = 98.55%, and approximately 98.97% of the samples preserved response consistency (y = yt). Results in Table 1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the transformations in successfully attacking the model (column RRA OOD). ID Tests. Given the agents policies specified in the system prompt, we prompt OpenAIs flagship model, ChatGPT-5, to construct in-domain questions. In particular, we generate diverse set of question styles, including Whquestions, definition/concept questions, process/mechanism questions, application/scenario questions, and negative-form questions. For each style, we collect 10 questions. The generated questions are manually verified by three annotators for both diversity and quality. Annotators are provided with the agents policies and asked to classify each query as ID or OOD. If sample is judged to be OOD, it is replaced with another ID sample. The final set of ID samples consists only of queries with full agreement among all annotators. We visualize ID and OOD diversity using t-SNE in Figure 2. The left plot shows ID samples, the center shows direct OODs, and the center shows adaptive OODs. Notably, the centroid of direct OODs (green) shifts toward the ID centroid (blue) after adversarial transformation, showing that adaptive OODs enable broader coverage of the OOD space. Figure 2: t-SNE spread of in-domain (Left), out-of-domain (center), all three in (Right). Right plot ID denotes questions inside medischeduler domain, OOD samples are taken from MMLU-math domain. Multilingual Tests. Since many LLMs are multilingual, the agents built on top of them are typically multilingual as well. Thus, multilingual samples becomes critical part of safety evaluations. To account for this, we expand our OOD tests beyond English (xen), which we initially select from MMLU. Specifically, we include queries in Chinese (Mandarin, xzh) and Hindi (xhi), two languages that differ markedly from English in linguistic family, structure, and script. Because MMLU questions are broadly unambiguous, we obtain their corresponding Chinese and Hindi counterparts from Global MMLU (Singh et al., 2024). We obtain multilingual version of the adaptive OOD dataset by en xt translating the laundered queries, performing xt Safety Metric As performance measures, we compute the acceptance rate (AR) for ID samples, and the refusal rate (RR) for direct OOD and adaptive OOD samples. Let RQ and TQ denote the number of refused queries and the total number of queries, respectively, such that RR = RQ 100 and AR = (1 - RQ ) 100. To capture the tradeoff between the two, we define the Operational Safety (OS) as the harmonic mean of the AR on ID samples (ARID) and the RR on OOD samples (RROOD), i.e., OS = (2 ARID RROOD) / (ARID + RROOD). Since we consider two types of OOD queries (direct and adaptive), the RR is obtained as their average: RROOD = (RRdirect zh and xt OOD +RRadaptive en xt OOD ) / 2. hi. Benchmark Statistics. To test the operational safety of LLMs, we construct 21 agents. Each agent is evaluated on 50 (#base ID) 3 (#languages) = 150 ID queries and on 3,351 (#direct OODs) 3 (#languages) = 10,053 multilingual queries in both the direct and adaptive OOD sets. Direct OODs are shared across all agents, whereas ID and adaptive OOD queries are specific to each agents policies. Thus, across all agents, an LLM is tested on set of 150 21 = 3,150 ID samples, 10,053 direct OOD samples, and 10,053 21 = 211,113 adaptive OOD samples. 4 Table 1: OFFTOPICEVAL evaluation of LLMs: Acceptance rate of in-domain (ARID) and refusal rate of direct (RRD OOD) across model families in English, Chinese, and Hindi.

            "content": "LLMs for Testing. We test operational safety of open-weight LLMs obtained from 6 commonly used families of LLMs used for constructing AI agents: Gemma (Google DeepMind, 2025b), Llama (Meta AI, 2025), GPT-OSS (OpenAI, 2025), Qwen (Team, 2025), Mistral (Mistral AI, 2025a), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024). From each family, we test two models, one small and one larger version, with latter being at least twice of the former. Specifically from Qwen family, we choose 10 models as it allows us to analyze the impact of reasoning capabilities, and model size ranging from 0.6B up till 235B. Overall, we test 20 (10 from Qwen and 2 each from other families) open-weight models on OFFTOPICEVAL. We list the specific model names and their corresponding sizes for each family in Appendix G. For closed-weight models, we include Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (Google DeepMind, 2025a), GPT-5 and GPT-4o mini (OpenAI, 2024a; 2025), and Claude Opus 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic, 2025c;b). We expand on other evaluation details in Appendix J. Creating LLM-based Agents. For each LLM under evaluation, we construct an agent by specifying policies through system prompt. These prompts incorporate multiple aspects that clearly delineate the agents ID and OOD spaces. Each profile defines the agents primary role (intended purpose, such as answering FAQs or providing workflow guidance), the set of allowed behaviors (queries it should handle, such as step-by-step instructions, generic feature explanations, or redirections to official support channels), and the set of forbidden behaviors (queries it must refuse, such as revealing sensitive data, processing transactions, impersonating staff, or addressing out-of-domain topics). In addition, each profile encodes explicit defense rules for resisting prompt injection attempts, safe fallback response for out-of-scope queries, and illustrative examples that demonstrate compliant answers and refusals. The full set of system prompts used is provided in Appendix Q."

            "content": "As shown in Table 1, across families, models achieve consistently high in-domain acceptance (ARID, typically above 95%) but markedly weaker out-of-domain refusal (RRD OOD). For example, GPT reaches 99.3% on IDs but only 56.780.4% on OODs; Qwen attains 99.1% ID yet 81.999.3% OOD; Llama-3 maintains 99.6% ID but drops to 25.5% OOD; Gemma exceeds 93% ID but only 39.494.2% OOD; Phi achieves 95.1% ID but as low as 35.1% OOD; and Mistral, despite lower ID rates (7375%), records unusually high OOD refusal up to 99.9%. On average, models accept 92% of ID queries but refuse only 64% of OODs. When OODs become adaptive (RRA OOD), we observe much more significant fall in accuracy in identifying refusals. On average, GPT drops by 63%,Gemma by 69%, Llama-3 by 97%, Phi by 47%, and Mistral by 33% relative to their ID performance. Strikingly, the adaptive OOD accuracy across all families falls below random chance (50%), indicating that models are not only failing to detect adaptive OOD queries but are in fact systematically misclassifying them. 5 Table 2: OFFTOPICEVAL evaluation of Qwen-3 LLMs across sizes, with and without thinking modes: Acceptance rate of in-domain (ARID) and refusal rate of direct (RRD OOD) across model families in English, Chinese, and Hindi.

Mistral (24B) emerges as the best-performing single model with an accuracy of 79.96%, whereas Llama-3.1 (8B) is the weakest with only 23.84%. At the family level, Qwen leads with the highest average operational safety score (71%, possible reason being bigger models), followed by GPT (68%) and Mistral (65%). Phi sits in the mid-range (59%), while Gemma is weaker (52%), and Llama-3 performs the worst as family (39%), primarily due to poor adaptive OOD refusal scores. These results underscore that while some families achieve strong ID and direct OOD performance, none are robust against adaptive OOD queries, which dominate the operational safety performance trend. When tested on Chinese and Hindi, we observe consistent trend: models perform extremely well on in-domain (ID) queries, often above 90%, but their refusal rates are low on direct OOD (RRD OOD) and collapse further on adaptive OOD (RRA OOD), often falling below random chance. This mirrors the English results and shows that the IDOOD gap is language-agnostic. At the family level, however, notable differences emerge: Mistral (24B) is the strongest model in English (79.96%), but in Chinese and Hindi, Qwen-3 (235B) dominates with oper of 81.54% and 88.16%, respectively. GPT models remain steady across languages with mid-to-high performance, while the Gemma and Llama-3 families replicate their weaknesses everywhereGemma-3 (12B) collapses to just 13.9% in Chinese and 18.88% in Hindi, and Llama-3.1 (8B) bottoms out at 23.84% in English. These results underscore that although all families share the same vulnerability to OOD queries, their relative strengths vary by language: Mistral peaks in English, Qwen dominates in Chinese and Hindi, and Gemma and Llama-3 consistently underperform. Table 3: ID acceptance, OOD refusal, and operational safety scores of closed-weight models on English test samples. Impact of size. The effect of model size (Table 2-non-thinking) is clearly visible. Large models such as Qwen-3 (235B, 32B, 14B, 8B) achieve consistently high ID acceptance rate (above 95% across languages) and correspondingly strong operational safety score (OS), with Qwen-3 (235B) reaching 77.8 in English, 81.5 in Chinese, and 88.2 in Hindi. Medium-sized models (30B, 8B, 4B) remain competitive, particularly in Hindi, where their adaptive OOD (RRA OOD) performance improves relative to English and Chinese (e.g., Qwen-3 (30B) reaches 52.5% on Hindi RRA OOD). However, small models (1.7B, 0.6B) collapse across all languages: while their ID scores remain respectable (>70%), Gemini 2.5 Pro Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite Claude Opus 4.1 Claude 3.5 Haiku GPT-5 GPT-4o mini Family Model 98.38 97.62 99.90 98.86 89.04 77.07 97.45 60. 97.09 79.90 99.81 99.90 94.76 96.67 63.35 92.68 95.24 77.96 99.05 64. 99.19 37.32 95.14 7.90 Gemini Claude ARID RRA RRD GPT OS OOD OOD OOD falls below 40% and RRA their RRD OOD approaches zero (e.g., 0.95%2.27%), driving OS down to 1731. These results highlight that while scaling improves robustness, it is not strictly monotonic: medium models can occasionally outperform larger ones on adaptive OOD, but small models fail catastrophically despite strong ID performance. Impact of reasoning capabilities. Reasoning-enabled models exhibit distinctive performance profile (Table 2 non-thinking vs thinking). On ID queries, they remain strong, often achieving an acceptance rate of 90%, showing that reasoning augmentation does not harm in-domain recognition. However, their ability to reject OOD queries degrades sharply. For direct OOD (RRD OOD), reasoning models consistently underperform their non-thinking counterparts, with an average score of only 5056% compared to 7379% for non-thinking models. The collapse is most severe on adaptive OOD (RRA OOD), where even large reasoning models score near zero (e.g., Qwen-3 (32B) achieves just 3.92 in English). As result, their operational safety scores (OS) are markedly lower across all languages (44.2 in English, 45.2 in Chinese, 52.3 in Hindi) relative to the non-thinking models. These results suggest that while reasoning maintains strong ID performance, it inadvertently increases susceptibility to OOD attacks, particularly adaptive ones, likely because reasoning chains make models more prone to justifying and accepting adversarial inputs. Closed-weight models. As shown in Table 3, closed-weight families generally achieve strong ID acceptance, with GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.1 all above 94%. Among them, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus 4.1 show balanced performance, maintaining very high refusal on both direct and adaptive OOD queries and operational safety scores above 97. In contrast, GPT-5 struggles on adaptive OODs (63.4% refusal, operational safety 89.0), while lighter variants such as Gemini Flash-Lite and GPT-4o mini degrade sharply in either OOD refusal or ID acceptance. Claude 3.5 Haiku, despite near-perfect ID acceptance, fails almost entirely on direct OODs (7.9%), yielding the lowest operational safety (60.0). These results indicate that flagship closed-weight models are among the strongest in operational safety, but smaller variants expose vulnerabilities. While flagship models such as GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 achieve high scores on OFFTOPICEVAL, we emphasize that this is necessary but not sufficient condition for model to be deemed operationally safe. In Figures 6 and 7, we demonstrate successful attack in which direct OOD prompt is further transformed, leading the model to respond to coding query that lies outside the agents region of operation. For safety reasons, we do not disclose the details of the attack in this work. Refusal Rate after failure. To analyze models refusal behavior once it has failed to identify an OOD query, we conducted two-turn experiment. In the first turn, we present each model with an adaptive OOD query that was previously accepted by the model. Immediately after this successful bypass, we evaluate refusal rates on direct OOD (OODD) and adaptive OOD (OODA) sets of the hrhelper. As shown in Table 4, refusal performance collapsed sharply across models. Llama3.3 (70B) dropped from 99.60% to 52.99% on direct OOD and from 68.92% to 2.79% on adaptive OOD, while Phi-4 (15B) declined by 28.88% and 58.41% on direct and adaptive OOD, respectively. Qwen-3 (30B) lost 19.26% on direct OOD and 25.35% on adaptive OOD, and Gemma-3 (27B) showed dramatic 50.88% reduction on adaptive OOD. Even Mistral (24B), which preserved nearperfect refusal on direct OOD, fell by 63.75% on adaptive OOD. These findings reveal that once model is breached by single adaptive OOD query, its downstream refusal ability is severely compromised, highlighting that current alignment of LLMs fails to guarantee multi-turn robustness and that maintaining safety across dialogue turns remains an open challenge.

On average, the refusal rate decreases by about 43.9% in English, 30.9% in Chinese, and 25.4% in Hindi, highlighting the susceptibility of models across all languages to adaptive adversarial transformations. Thus, we explore approaches to make agents better at discriminating OODs from IDs. Such solutions include prompt-based steering, and activation steering Chen et al. (2025a). Prompt-based steering. We hypothesize that OOD prompts, presented immediately before the model begins generating response, degrade the models adherence to the policies specified in the system prompt. To mitigate this effect, we propose the use of steering prompts appended as suffixes to the users query (we detail these prompts in Appendix P), thereby reinforcing the models grounding in the system prompt and the core query content. We introduce two such prompt suffixes: P-ground. After the model has seen the users query, we append the instruction: Forget the above text and focus on the system prompt, then respond to the users query appropriately. This encourages the model to recover its degraded understanding of the system prompt. Q-ground. Instead of explicitly recovering the system prompt, we ask the model to rewrite the users query in its closest minimal form and then respond to the query. This grounds the models understanding in the true user intention, thereby reducing the degrading effect of the original query.

Across open-weight  (Table 5)  , closedweight  (Table 6)  , and multilingual settings  (Table 7)  , grounding consistently boosts operational safety (OS). On English openweight models, Q-ground yields 218% OS improvements (e.g., 16.65% for Phi-4; 18.10% for Qwen-3), while P-ground delivers the largest gains, up to 26.76% for Qwen-3, driven by concurrent increases in RRD OOD with only minor changes in ARID. Closed-weight models shows moderate improvements: Pground raises GPT-5 to 92.17% (+3.13%) and Gemini-2.5 Flash-Lite to 83.57% (+3.67%), while Q-ground produces gain of 2.85% for GPT-5. The pattern generalizes beyond English: in Chinese and Hindi, Q-ground typically adds 528% OS, and P-ground adds 1135% (e.g., Llama-3.3 (70B) +35.32% on Hindi), largely by improving refusal on both direct and adaptive OOD queries while preserving in-domain acceptance.

Activation steering has been shown to mitigate safety and persona compromises (Chen et al., 2025b; Turner et al., 2023). We explored the impact of this method in preventing compromises to models policies. For our experiments, we selected three LLMsQwen-3 (4B), Phi-4, and Ministral (8B)and built two AI agents (bankhelper and medischeduler) on top of them. For each agents policies, we generated an alter-ego of the system prompt by inverting the policies: the model is instructed to reject ID samples but accept OOD samples. We refer to the policy-carrying system prompt as pos-sys and its negation as neg-sys. From each agents ID dataset, we sampled 15 questions and used them to extract vectors {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and {v are obtained by prompting the LLM with the ith ID sample under pos-sys and neg-sys, respectively. Thus, we define the steering vector as the sum of the directional shift vi 4 across range of steering coefficients (α {3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0}). The result is shown in Table 8. In addition, we note that steering is modeland task-specific method that often requires grid-search to identify optimal layers and α values, which makes it computationally intensive, though arguably only one-time cost. i.

While prior alignment research has primarily emphasized filtering harmful content, our study demonstrates that current models are highly unsafe for specific, intended use cases. To address this gap, we introduced OFFTOPICEVAL, multilingual, multi-domain benchmark that provides the first systematic evaluation of operational safety. Our large-scale analysis reveal consistent and concerning weakness: all evaluated models remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models fall far short of reliability. To mitigate this issue, we proposed lightweight, 2L is the number of layers of the model 9 prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (Pground). These training-free techniques substantially improve OOD refusal. Our work highlights that operational safety is fundamental but underdeveloped component of LLM alignment. We believe that OFFTOPICEVAL will serve as foundational tool for future research, inspiring the development of more comprehensive, domain-aware safety strategies to ensure reliable LLM-based agent deployment."

The LLM was not involved in research ideation, methodology design, data analysis, or result interpretation. All scientific contributions, experiments, and conclusions are entirely the work of the authors. We have ensured that the LLM-generated text adheres to ethical guidelines and does not contribute to plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts). MMLU ACCURACY BEFORE AND AFTER LAUNDERING. Table 10 reports model performance on the original MMLU questions compared to their transformed BankHelper-style versions. Across all models, accuracy drops noticeably after transformation, with declines ranging from 10%15% (e.g., Llama from 83.5% to 71.3%, Gemma from 81.4% to 67.4%). This confirms that even superficially rephrased questions, when embedded into in-domain formats, significantly erode model reliability. Consistency scores are moderate (72%77%), indicating that while models often preserve their original answer, substantial fraction of cases flip under transformation. Qwen shows the highest consistency (75.4%), suggesting relatively stronger robustness, but no model maintains both high accuracy and stability. These results highlight the potency of adversarial reframing: it does not merely reduce refusal rates, but also directly undermines correctness."

As shown in Figure 3, each query is translated into English, Chinese, and Hindi, and the embeddings were computed using shared multilingual encoder (Qwen-3-Embedding-8B (Zhang et al., 2025)). The results demonstrate that translated variants of the same query form compact clusters, with their centroids nearly overlapping across all three languages. Furthermore, the clusters corresponding to different query types (ID, direct OOD, adaptive OOD) remain well-separated from one another, while maintaining cross-lingual 13 Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of multilingual (English, Hindi, Chinese) in-domain (ID), direct out-of-domain (OOD), and adaptive OOD queries from the MediScheduler assistant. alignment.

As shown in Figure 4, ID queries (blue) and direct OOD queries (green) are well separated in all cases, indicating that direct OOD inputs remain distributionally distant from the in-domain space. In contrast, adaptive OOD queries (orange), which are generated through semantic transformations of OOD inputs, consistently shift closer to the ID region. This shift is visible across all four subjects, though the movement is moderate rather than drastic. Such pattern is desirable: if adaptive OOD queries were to overlap too strongly with the ID distribution, they would risk losing their original semantic content. Instead, these visualizations confirm that adaptive OOD queries balance between preserving their OOD semantics and encroaching upon the ID space, thereby posing more challenging test for operational safety. Figure 4: t-SNE visualization comparing Medischeduler ID questions with OOD questions from multiple domains. After transformation, the OOD questions shift closer to the ID distribution. However, they do not fully overlap with ID questions, as being too close would risk losing the original semantic distinctions of the OOD queries."

            "title": "F EFFECT OF SYSTEM PROMPT DESIGN",
            "content": "To investigate the impact of system prompt design on model behavior, we conduct an experiment varying the number of paragraphs included in the system prompt. We segment the system prompt into eight distinct paragraphs by # or ##, and define P1P8 as cumulative inclusions. Specifically, P1 contains only the first paragraph; P2 contains the first two; . . . ; P8 includes all eight. The results are presented in Table 11. The data show that across models, increasing the prompt length has only marginal effects on in-domain accuracy, which remains consistently high (e.g., Llama-3.3 (70B) stays around 99%96%, and Phi-4 (15B) around 95%). However, refusal rates for direct OOD queries exhibit much larger fluctuations. For example, Llama-3.3 improves its direct OOD refusal from 18.38% at P1 to 74.64% at P6, but then declines to 70.69% at P8. Similarly, Gemma-3 (27B) and Qwen-3 (30B) both see progressive gains in direct OOD refusal as more paragraphs are added, with Qwen-3 rising from 29.76% to 82.29%. Adaptive OOD refusal rates are generally low across all models but also benefit from additional context, as seen in Qwen-3 (30B), which improves from 2.50% to 23.52%. Mistral (24B), in contrast, starts from relatively high baseline of 88.90% direct OOD refusal and shows limited incremental benefit from longer prompts. These findings indicate that system prompt length has substantial effect on OOD refusal while exerting little influence on in-domain accuracy. Longer prompts can reinforce the models safety posture, improving its ability to refuse OOD queries, though the effect is model-dependent and may saturate or even decline when prompts become excessively long. This highlights prompt design as crucial lever for improving refusal robustness without sacrificing task performance. Table 11: Evaluation of Different System Prompts.

Closed-source models are evaluated under their default settings. The random seed is set to 24. These choices balance two objectives: ensuring reliable refusal parsing and preserving diversity in generated content. We employ an FP8-quantized version of Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (Meta AI, 2025), provided by RedHatAI (RedHatAI, 2025). REFUSAL RATE@K The left part of Figure 5 reports refusal rates on adaptive OOD questions when they are preceded by in-domain queries that models almost never refuse. The results indicate that prefixing consistently weakens model refusal. For example, Llama and Phi-4 already show relatively low refusal rates and decline further as increases, suggesting strong susceptibility to in-domain priming. Gemma and Mistral start with much higher refusal rates but still exhibit non-trivial drop as grows, with flip rates in the range of 36%, showing that repeated exposure to in-domain queries gradually shifts 15 their behavior. Qwen-3 maintains refusal rates close to 99% across all prefix lengths, and its flip rate remains zero, which highlights its strong resistance to prefix conditioning. Figure 5: Refusal Rate (left axis) and Flip Rate (right axis, bars+lines) for the BankHelper assistant. The left panel shows direct OOD queries, while the right panel shows adaptive queries. The right part of Figure 5 presents the same setting but for adversarial OOD attacks. Here the effect of prefixing becomes more apparent: the attack success rate (ASR) steadily increases with K, showing that in-domain priming can effectively erode refusal barriers. Gemma is most affected, with ASR rising sharply as more in-domain queries are added, while Llama and Phi-4 exhibit moderate increases. Mistral remains highly vulnerable throughout, with very high ASR regardless of prefix length, indicating that its defenses are weak even without priming. Qwen-3 shows relatively stable behavior, with ASR largely unaffected by prefixing and flip rates remaining negligible, suggesting that its vulnerability lies more in baseline attackability than in contextual erosion."

            "content": "We also train models to be good ID-OOD discriminator before responding to the main prompt. We LoRA-tuned (Hu et al., 2022) Gemma-3 (27B) and Qwen-3 (4B). To construct the training corpus, we design 10 distinct assistant scenarios (i.e. set of policies), each comprising 100 ID and OOD questions, yielding balanced set of 2,000 training samples. To obtain ground truth refusals, for ID queries, we prompt the respective LLMs in general QA mode i.e. without any system prompt attached. Training on models own responses is to ensure steering and distillation. For obtaining OOD, we assigned hard-coded refusal response. For supervised fine-tune of Gemma-3 (27B) and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct (4B), we adopt the LoRA approach with rank 16 applied to all trainable target modules. The models are trained with cutoff length of 8192 tokens, cosine learning rate schedule with an initial learning rate of 5 105, warmup ratio of 0.1, and batch size of 1 with gradient accumulation of 8 steps. Training is conducted for one epoch, with bf16 precision enabled. As shown in Table 12, the supervised fine-tuning approach yields little to no benefit in terms of operational safety. For Gemma-3 (27B), SFT slightly increases in-domain acceptance rate (+10.3%) but at the cost of markedly reduced OOD refusal, leading to an overall decline in OS from 63.78% to 58.20% (5.58%). For Qwen-3 (4B), the degradation is even more severe: despite nearly perfect in-domain accuracy, OOD refusal collapses after SFT, resulting in OS dropping from 50.92% to just 8.89% (42.02%). These results indicate that naive alignment through LoRA-tuning on small discriminator-style corpus fails to reliably improve safety and can in fact make models significantly more vulnerable to OOD queries.

            "title": "L DATA COLLECTION DETAILS",
            "content": "In Domain generation. To construct high-quality in-domain question datasets for each assistant, we design standardized prompting template as shown in Appendix that guides the model to generate diverse and representative user queries. The prompt instructs the model to first select five distinct topics relevant to the assistants domain, and then produce ten multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for each topic. To ensure coverage of different reasoning patterns and linguistic structures, the prompt explicitly requires inclusion of five question types: Whquestions, definition/concept 17 Figure 6: Claude Opus respond to an adaptive OOD query. Figure 7: ChatGPT-5 response to an adaptive OOD query. 18 questions, process/mechanism questions, application/scenario-based questions, and negative-form questions. Each question is returned in JSON format with clearly defined fields for the question text, list of four answer choices, and the correct answer. This design ensures both structural consistency and semantic diversity across the generated in-domain data, and supports downstream evaluation of the models performance under realistic, task-relevant conditions. OOD Question Construction. We use MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) as the basis for constructing out-of-domain (OOD) data, since it covers wide range of disciplines and provides rich source of questions beyond the scope of our assistant scenarios. To ensure objectivity, we exclude categories that do not primarily rely on factual knowledge (e.g., logical fallacies, miscellaneous, moral disputes, and moral scenarios). For the remaining tasks, we design system prompts for 21 real-world assistants and employ small model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Team, 2024) to filter the data. Specifically, for each question in MMLU, we randomly pair it with one assistants system prompt and ask the model to determine whether the question is relevant to that domain. Through this filtering process, we obtain the desired OOD data. Finally, we restrict our selection to questions with both the stem and options totaling fewer than 30 words, as shorter questions are easier to rewrite and more suitable for evaluation. OOD Question Transformation. To further construct adversarial OOD data, we design prompt that leverages Llama-3.3 (70B) to rewrite the filtered OOD questions into OOD attack queries. In this step, each question is transformed with reference to the corresponding assistants system prompt, such that the resulting query closely resembles the style and surface form of an in-domain request. While these rewritten questions appear highly aligned with the assistants domain, human annotator can easily recognize that their underlying intent remains out-of-domain. This design creates challenging adversarial setting for evaluating whether models can resist subtle boundary-crossing attacks. IN-DOMAIN QUESTION GENERATION PROMPT In-domain Data Generation Prompt The above is system prompt of an AI assistant. Can you generate diverse question types that the user may ask the chatbot assistant? Refrain from using you. Plan 5 different topics of questioning, and for each topic generate 10 diverse questions. All questions should be multiple-choice (MCQ) in JSON format, with three fields: question, choices, and answer (A, B, C, D). Please cover the following types of questions for each topic: WhQuestions: Ask for specific information using which, what, when, why, or how. Example Question: Which of the following options best explains the situation? Definition/Concept Questions: Test recall of facts, meanings, or categories. Example Question: certain concept is defined as ... or This term is an example of ... Process/Mechanism Questions: Focus on steps, sequences, or cause-effect relationships. Example Question: When event happens, what is the immediate result? Application/Scenario Questions: Use situation or short story and ask for interpretation or outcome. Example Question: In given scenario, how would factor affect the outcome? Negative-form Questions: Ask for an exception, requiring recognition of what is not true. Example Question: Which of the following is NOT correct statement? Return JSON."
