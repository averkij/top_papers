Introduction Understanding the geometry and semantics of 3D scenes from image observations is fundamental computer vision task with broad applications in robotics [26], autonomous driving [46, 65], medical image analysis [18, 112], and civil engineering [69]. The Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task unifies 3D geometry and semantic prediction from limited image observations [63, 88, 95]. Recent progress in SSC has been primarily driven by utilizing supervised learning [37, 87, 95]. However, acquiring large-scale 3D annotations is highly labor-intensive [65]. While significant resources have been invested in collecting human annotations for 2D tasks [52, 84], annotating similar amounts of data in 3D remains unapproached. This motivates approaching SSC without the need for manually annotated data. Existing SSC approaches rely on ground-truth semantic annotations and frequently utilize additional supervision from LiDAR scans [37, 45, 73, 95]. In contrast, we are the first to approach SSC in fully unsupervised setting, i.e. without task supervision or other supervised components. In particular, we aim to approach SSC from single image without relying on any human annotations, only learning from unlabeled multi-view images using self-supervision. This setting is extremely challenging for two reasons: first, the human-defined nature of semantic taxonomies is ambiguous, and second, single image only provides partial observation of the scene with many invisible areas. We take inspiration from recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) of 2D representations and 3D reconstruction. 2D SSL representations, such as from DINO [11], have been shown effective for 2D unsupervised scene understanding [32, 103]. 3D reconstruction approaches successfully leveraged SSL from multi-view data to infer dense 3D geometry from single image [33, 107]. In this paper, we present SceneDINO, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach for unsupervised semantic scene completion.

Our general 3D feature representations enable us to approach unsupervised 3D scene understanding. Harnessing our expressive 3D features, we propose novel 3D feature distillation approach for obtaining unsupervised semantic predictions in 3D. While we focus on the task of unsupervised SSC, SceneDINOs features are general, offering foundation for different 3D scene-understanding tasks by building on our 3D feature field. Specifically, we make the following contributions: (i) We introduce SceneDINO, the first approach predicting dense 3D geometry and expressive 3D features in feedforward manner from single image. (ii) We effectively distill SceneDINOs feature field representation in 3D, obtaining unsupervised semantic predictions. (iii) We demonstrate the first fully unsupervised SSC results. We build simple yet competitive unsupervised SSC baseline, lifting unsupervised 2D semantic predictions. Our SceneDINO approach outperforms this SSC baseline in unsupervised SSC as well as established 2D approaches in 2D semantic segmentation. (iv) Finally, we also showcase the domain generalization ability and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO. 2. Related Work Single-image scene reconstruction. Estimating 3D geometry from image observations is fundamental task in computer vision and has been studied for decades [36]. Traditional approaches, such as structure from motion [89], as well as recent neural radiance fields (NeRFs) [74], perform scene reconstruction using multiple images, as reviewed by multiple surveys [34, 108, 119]. Recently, estimating dense 3D geometry from single image have been approached [8, 33, 80, 85, 96, 102, 107, 113]. Unlike monocular depth estimation [75], these approaches predict the depth for visible and occluded regions, reconstructing complete scene. Behind the Scenes (BTS) [107] introduced an approach for unsupervised single-image scene reconstruction using multi-view self-supervision, which infers dense 3D geometry in feed-forward manner. Our approach extends BTS by additionally lifting self-supervised features into 3D for unsupervised 3D scene understanding. Semantic scene completion (SSC), also known as 3D semantic occupancy prediction, aims to jointly estimate the 3D geometry and semantics of scene [62, 63, 95, 117]. Initial approaches used 3D semantic and geometric annotations and addressed indoor scenes [6, 13, 5759, 67, 116], outdoor scenes with LiDAR [16, 61, 86, 87, 109], or both domains [8, 73]. Using birds-eye views has been proven effective for SSC [44, 64, 99]. To overcome the need for 3D annotations, approaches for using 2D annotations have been proposed [37, 45, 81]. While SelfOcc [45] and RenderOcc [81] use multiple inference views, S4C [37] performs single-image SSC. In particular, S4C [37] employs supervised 2D model and lifts 2D multi-view semantic predictions into 3D. In contrast to using 2D annotations, GaussTR [48] uses 2D foundation models for SSC and multiple views during inference. However, GaussTR relies on heavily supervised foundation models, including SAM [52] and Metric3Dv2 [42], and uses weak supervision from image/text pairs. To the best of our knowledge, there is no method for approaching SSC without the need for any ground-truth annotations. Our work presents the first unsupervised SSC approach, utilizing lifted SSL features and single RGB input image for inference. Self-supervised representation learning (SSL) aims to extract general features from data without annotations, facilitating various downstream tasks such as segmentation [24]. Recent SSL methods, often based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) [23], leverage clustering [2, 9, 10, 47, 60], masked modeling [20, 29, 39, 76, 106], contrastive learning [3, 12, 14, 38, 40, 41], or negative-free [4, 5, 11, 28, 79] pretext tasks [22, 78] for large-scale training. Stateof-the-art models, e.g., DINO [11], produce semantically rich, dense features, driving recent advances in 2D unsupervised scene understanding [32, 103]. We here aim to bring expressive features from DINO [11, 79] to 3D for SSC. 2D-to-3D feature lifting. The expressiveness of 2D visual representations has motivated lifting 2D features into 3D [93, 110]. Existing approaches utilize multi-view 2D features for 3D feature lifting [30, 43, 49, 53, 72, 82, 92, 93, 97, 100, 101, 105, 110, 115]. Lifting 2D features is effective in various tasks, including few-shot semantic occupancy prediction [110], and refining 2D representations [115]. However, existing feature-lifting approaches fit to single scene [49, 53, 92, 93, 100, 101, 110, 115], require RGB-D inputs [30, 43, 72, 97, 105], or work on 3D point cloud inputs [82]. The only feed-forward approaches that use RGB inputs and lift 2D features, which we are aware of, are GaussTR [48]; MVSplat360 [15]. However, both approaches utilize multiple input images during inference, and MVSplat360 [15] only predicts low-dimensional feature representations, which are not suitable for unsupervised scene understanding. In contrast, we propose the first feedforward approach for inferring lifted high-dimensional and rich 3D features using single input image. 2D unsupervised semantic segmentation partitions images automatically into semantically meaningful regions without any form of human annotations. Early deep learning-based methods [17, 35, 47] approach the problem via representation learning. Leveraging SSL features from DINO as an inductive prior, STEGO [32] distills the feature representation into lower-dimensional space for unsupervised probing. Building up on STEGO, subsequent methods 2 I0 ξ pxi fxiσxi eu ϕ xi Embedding eu ϕ (u, d) γ σ Density σi Feature fi (cid:90) ( ˆd, ˆf , ˆc) Reconstructed views I1 xi xi Multi-view image & feature reconstruction Sample at us Color ci Target views (a) 3D feature field & semantic inference (b) Volumetric feature & image rendering (c) Self-supervised multi-view training Figure 2. SceneDINO architecture, rendering, and training. (a) Inference: Given single input image I0 during inference, 2D encoder-decoder ξ produces the embedding from which the local embedding eu is interpolated. The MLP encoder ϕ takes in eu and 3D position xi, and predicts both the density σxi and the 3D feature fxi . Using lightweight unsupervised segmentation head h, we can obtain semantic predictions pxi using fxi . (b) Rendering: Our feature field allows for volume rendering by shooting rays through it, yielding depth ˆd and ˆf in 2D. Color ci is sampled from an another view (e.g., I1) using us and rendered to obtain the reconstructed color ˆc. (c) Multi-view training: We render 2D views (features & images) from our feature field and reconstruct the training views. [31, 50, 91, 94] propose enhancements to the distillation. Our approach follows the idea of STEGO [32], extending it to 3D and integrating feature distillation using our 3D feature field to build the first unsupervised SSC approach. 3. Unsupervised Semantic Scene Completion We approach semantic scene completion (SSC) without any form of manual supervision. To this end, we first describe SceneDINO, predicting 3D geometry and expressive 3D features from single image in feed-forward manner (Sec. 3.1), and SceneDINOs multi-view training (Sec. 3.2). Next, we present our 3D feature distillation approach to obtain unsupervised 3D semantic predictions (Sec. 3.3). An overview of our full pipeline, including inference, rendering, and multi-view self-supervision, is provided in Fig. 2. Notation. Let I0 [0, 1]3HW be single RGB input image (for both training & inference) with corresponding pose T0 R44 and projection matrix K0 R34. For training, let (Iv, Tv, Kv) with {1, 2, . . . , n}, be additional views for multi-view self-supervision. Assuming pinhole camera model, any 3D point R3 in world coordinates can be projected onto the image plane of view and the input view = 0 with the perspective projection πv(x). 3.1. SceneDINO Given single input image I0, SceneDINO represents the dense geometric structure and features of scene as continuous mapping from world coordinates R3 to volumetric density σx R+ and feature fx RD. This continuous output representation is often called feature field. While SceneDINO could represent any feature space, we aim for expressive SSL features from DINO [11, 79]. Architecture & feature field inference. Our SceneDINO architecture comprises two main parts: 2D encoderdecoder ξ and an MLP decoder (cf . Fig. 2a), following BTS [107]. ξ takes in I0 and produces per-pixel embedding RDEHW with DE dimensions. Intuitively, every spatial element of represents camera ray through pixel, capturing both local geometry and features. To infer the feature at 3D position x, we employ two-layer MLP decoder ϕ (cf . Fig. 2a). Given position within the camera frustum, we project into the camera plane, obtaining the pixel location = π0(x). We query at the position using bilinear interpolation, obtaining the local embedding eu. Based on the embedding eu, the pixel position u, and the distance dx R+ of to the camera, we obtain the density σx and feature prediction fx as (σx, fx) = ϕ(eu, γ(u, dx)), (1) where γ denotes positional encoding [74]. Feature, depth & color volume rendering. SceneDINO predicts continuous feature field from single image. This representation can be used to render features and depth in 2D from an arbitrary viewpoint (cf . Fig. 2b), following the discretization strategy of Max et al. [71]. Given viewpoint (Tr, Kr), we sample points xi along the ray through pixel ur, with distance δi between xi and xi+1. Based on the volumetric densities σxi (cf . Eq. 1), we can compute the probabilities αi of the ray ending between xi and xi+1, and accumulate these into Vi, the probability of xi being visible: Vi = i1 (cid:89) j=1 (1 αj) , with αi = 1 exp(σxiδi) . (2) Using Vi and αi, we render depth dur and feature fur from the estimated features fxi from Eq. (1) and distances dxi to xi onto the image plane at position ur as fur = (cid:88) i=1 Viαifxi dur = (cid:88) i=1 Viαidxi. (3) 3 The differentiability of this rendering process enables us to self-supervise SceneDINO using multi-view images and their 2D feature representations (e.g., from DINO [11]). SceneDINO predicts 3D geometry and features, but does not predict color as we focus on semantic downstream tasks. To obtain color for image reconstruction during training, we follow the color sampling approach of BTS [107]. 3.2. 3D feature field training We train SceneDINO using multi-view self-supervision (cf . Fig. 2c), aiming to obtain an expressive and view-consistent feature field without the need for any form of manual annotations. For self-supervision, we sample + 1 views Iv with camera parameters1 Tv, Kv from the data and obtain dense 2D features Fv from self-supervised ViT (e.g., DINO [11]). Note that the 2D features entail resolution of Fv RD , due to the ViT patch size p. The set of training views and features = {(Iv, Tv, Kv, Fv) = 0, . . . , n} is randomly partitioned into two subsets Vsource and Vtarget. Training reconstructs the views Vtarget using the views of Vsource. In practice, we use randomly sampled set of image patches that align with the ViT patches instead of the full image. In the following, we still refer to images for the sake of brevity. Image reconstruction. We aim to learn the geometry of our feature field via multi-view photometric consistency. In particular, for every image It Vtarget we derive reconstructed image ˆIt,s from every view in Vsource using differentiable rendering and color sampling. Equipped with both the reconstructed image ˆIt,s and the target image It, we compute our photometric loss per patch as Lp = min (cid:16) IsVsource λ1L1(It, ˆIt,s) + λSSIMLSSIM(It, ˆIt,s) (cid:17) . (4) We only consider the minimum per-patch loss across the different views in Vsource. The scalars λ1 and λSSIM weight the absolute error L1 and the SSIM loss LSSIM [104]. To regularize the 3D geometry prediction, we impose smoothness using an edge-aware smoothness loss [27]. Based on the estimated depth dut (cf . Eq. 3), we obtain the inverse and mean-normalized depth ut. Using ut, we compute the edge-aware smoothness Ls for pixel ut as Ls = d ut exIt + d ut eyIt, (5) using the first spatial derivatives and at ut. Feature reconstruction. We learn multi-view consistent and expressive 3D feature field using the 2D features Ft from Vtarget. As we aim to learn high-resolution (continuous) feature field, we render 2D features using Eq. 3 at the full image resolution ˆFt RDHW. To compensate for 1Note, camera poses can be obtained using unsupervised visual SLAM [7], strictly adhering to the fully unsupervised setting. 3D feature distillation. Given an input Figure 3. image, SceneDINO predicts 3D feature field. 3D features fX are sampled from the feature field. For fX, we obtain fYkNN and fYkrand from the feature buffer. The segmentation head distills the features into low-dimensional space and is trained using Ldist. the reduced spatial dimension of Ft, we employ the downsampler ψ proposed by Fu et al. [25] to our rendered features ˆFt. While current 2D SSL features capture semantics, they lack multi-view consistency, i.a., due to positional encodings used in ViTs [111], leading to different features for identical visual content at two distinct positions in an image. As we aim for multi-view consistency, we compensate for this by learning constant decomposition RD of features induced by positional encodings. Our feature loss is defined per feature as Lf = 1 cos-sim(Ft, ψ( ˆFt) + F), (6) where cos-sim is the cosine similarity between two features. As image edges correlate with semantic edges and to further impose consistency, we regularize the rendered features ˆFt using an edge-aware smoothness loss per feature Lfs = ˆFt exIt + ˆFt eyIt. (7) Our final loss for training SceneDINO is weighted sum of the photometric loss, the feature loss, and both smoothness losses LSceneDINO = λpLp + λsLs + λfLf + λfsLfs, averaged over all pixels and features. 3.3. 3D feature distillation for unsupervised SSC Given the expressive feature field representation, we aim to obtain unsupervised semantic predictions for SSC. While naıve k-means [68, 70] can yield meaningful pseudo semantics, distilling features into lower-dimensional space has been shown to be more effective in 2D semantic segmentation [32, 54]. To this end, we present novel 3D feature distillation approach (cf . Fig. 3). We train pointwise segmentation head h, mapping fx RD to lowerdimensional distilled representation zx RK, with D. The resulting distilled space is clustered to obtain pseudosemantic predictions px [0, 1]C, with pseudo classes. Existing work in 2D unsupervised semantic segmentation has shown that SSL feature correspondence captures 4 semantic class co-occurence [32]. This correspondence between two batches of sample points = [x1, . . . , xN] and = [y1, . . . , yN] can be expressed by pairwise feature similarity Si,j = cos-sim(fxi, fyj ) [1, 1]. Similarly, we can express the correspondence in the distilled feature space by Sh i,j = cos-sim(h(fxi ), h(fyj )) [1, 1]. We describe the sampling of the xi and yj below. Feature distillation. We aim to distill features such that similar features align while dissimilar features are separated. To this end, we use the contrastive correlation loss Lcorr, introduced by STEGO [32] and defined as Lcorr(fX, fY, b) = (cid:88) (Si,j b) max(Sh i,j, 0), (8) i,j where fX, fY are the features of the two sample batches. This loss pushes Sh i,j towards 1 in case Si,j exceeds the threshold b. Otherwise, Lcorr pushes the Sh i,j below 0. The correlation loss Lcorr requires informative pairs of sampled features, balancing attractive and repulsive signals. Following STEGO [32], we consider three different relations: (1) feature pairs from the same image (fX, fX), (2) feature pairs from an image and its k-nearest neighbors in feature space (fX, fYkNN), and (3) feature pairs from an image and randomly sampled other image (fX, fYrand). Note that each pair is obtained from SceneDINOs 3D feature field, see below. Equipped with the three feature sample pairs, we compute the full distillation loss as Ldist =λselfLcorr(fX, fX, bself) + λkNNLcorr(fX, fYkNN , bkNN) + λrandLcorr(fX, fYrand, brand), (9) where λself, λkNN, and λrand denote the scalar loss weights. bself, bkNN, and brand are the contrastive thresholds. Feature sampling in 3D. While obtaining feature pairs using 2D rendered features is straightforward [32], we aim to take advantage of our learned 3D geometry of the scene. To this end, we introduce novel 3D feature sampling approach for the distillation loss Ldist from Eq. (9). Our goal is to sample features both similar and dissimilar in terms of the encoded semantic concept, which should capture rich semantics as well as different semantic concepts. First, we obtain all visible 3D surface points R3G and their depth dV RG + from the camera. To sample points that cover different semantic concepts, we use depth as cue and sample different depth ranges. In particular, we sort the surface points based on dV. The sorted surface points ˆV are partitioned into equally-sized chunks; we uniformly sample single 3D point from each chunk, resulting in center points R3M. Equipped with the center points X, we aim to extract rich semantic features from the feature field. While we could just obtain the features for X, we query positions in the 5 Center point Xi Accepted samples Rejected samples Figure 4. 3D feature sampling. We first sample center point Xi from all visible surface points. Further points are sampled within the radius around the center point Xi. Sampled points with sufficient density are accepted; otherwise rejected. The accepted points are used to obtain the feature batch fX. neighborhood of to increase semantic richness and better capture the 3D structure of the scene for distillation. In particular, for each center point, we randomly sample point within radius of = 0.5 m. To account for samples falling into unoccupied regions in our feature field, we only keep samples with sufficient density σ > 0.5. We repeat this sampling process until we obtain valid samples per center point. Using these samples, we query our feature field, resulting in feature batch fX RDN for each of the center points in each scene (cf . Fig. 4). To obtain fYkNN and fYrand, we utilize feature buffer that efficiently stores the sampled features of multiple scenes. Given new input image, we obtain feature batches fX as just described. For each fX, we randomly sample another feature batch from the buffer to obtain fYrand. To obtain fYkNN, we search in the feature buffer for the k-nearest neighbors of fX, using the average feature of each batch. From these k-nearest neighbors, we randomly pick feature batch to obtain fYkNN and compute the distillation loss Ldist. After repeating this process for each of the current feature batches, we add the current feature batches to the feature buffer and remove the oldest batches. Unsupervised probing. To obtain semantic predictions, we probe the distilled feature space using k-means [68, 70]. In particular, we iteratively update cluster centers θ RKC using cosine distance-based mini-batch kmeans [90] during distillation. To infer the final semantic prediction, we compute px = softmax(cos-sim(h(fx), θ)). 4. Experiments We evaluate SceneDINO on SSC and compare it to simple unsupervised SSC baseline (Sec. 4.1). We also report results for 2D unsupervised segmentation, including domain generalization results (Sec. 4.2). Finally, we explore multiview feature consistency (Sec. 4.3) and present an analysis of SceneDINO and our 3D distillation (Sec. 4.4). Datasets. We train using KITTI-360 [65], composed of clips from moving vehicle equipped with cameras. For consistency, we follow S4C [37] by sampling eight views and using the dataset camera poses. We also provide results with estimated poses. We also show experiments for training on RealEstate10k [118], composed of monocular videos. Here, we follow the setup of BTS [107], obtaining three views. If not noted differently, we report results obtained with training on KITTI-360. For SSC and 2D semantic segmentation validation, we use the SSCBench-KITTI360 test split [63]. Cityscapes [19] and BDD100K [114] val are used for domain generalization results. To enable evaluation in 3D and 2D, we use the 19-class taxonomy of Cityscapes and perform 2D evaluation on Cityscapes, BDD100K, and KITTI-360 on 19 classes. For SSCBench, we combine classes to adhere to the 15 SSCBench classes. 3D evaluation. Given our unsupervised setup, we predict pseudo-semantic classes that must be aligned with the ground truth for evaluation. We follow standard practice in 2D unsupervised semantic segmentation [17, 31, 32, 50, 91, 94] by applying Hungarian matching [56] to align our pseudo semantics. For validating the aligned semantics, we follow the standardized SSCBench [63] protocol and report both semantic performance using the mean Intersectionover-Union (mIoU) and geometric performance using IoU, precision, and recall. We report all metrics on SSCBench ranges 12.8 m, 25.6 m, and 51.2 m. 2D evaluation. Following the established evaluation protocol in 2D unsupervised semantic segmentation [17, 31, 32, 50, 91, 94], we use the all-pixel accuracy (Acc) and mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) metrics. Likewise, in line with prior work, 2D segmentation predictions of all models are refined using dense Conditional Random Field [55] before computing Acc and mIoU. Multi-view feature consistency evaluation. We aim to evaluate the multi-view consistency of our feature field. As we are not aware of any general feed-forward 3D feature field approach, we compare against 2D SSL models. To measure multi-view consistency in 2D, we use two video frames and estimate optical flow and occlusions with RAFT [98]. We backward warp 2D features of the second frame to the first. On the aligned features, we compute the feature similarity using absolute error (L1), the Euclidean distance (L2), and the cosine similarity, ignoring occlusions. Baselines. We are not aware of any existing unsupervised SSC approach. To allow for comparisons, we construct competitive baseline for unsupervised SSC. In particular, we train the S4C approach with unsupervised semantics of the established STEGO [32] approach. For 2D semantic segmentation, we use U2Seg [77] and STEGO [32] as established unsupervised baselines. Note U2Seg is trained on ImageNet [21] and COCO [66] using STEGO pseudolabels. We use STEGO [32] with DINO [11] (ViT-B/8), DINOv2 [79] (ViT-B/14), and FiT3D [115] (ViT-B/14) Table 1. SSCBench-KITTI-360 results.

FiT3D offers multi-view refined DINOv2 features [115]. Note that FiT3D reports results, concatenating the refined features with DINOv2 features. We report results using both plain features only and the concatenation. We also use rendered 2D segmentations of our S4C + STEGO baseline for 2D validation. For multi-view feature consistency, we utilize DINO [11], DINOv2, and FiT3D [115] features as baseline. Implementation details. Our encoder-decoder uses DINO-B/8 [11] backbone and dense prediction decoder [83]. The MLP decoder ϕ entails two layers with 128 hidden features. As rendering features is expensive, ϕ predicts 64 features. We employ another MLP to upproject again to the full dimensionality = 768. If not stated differently, our target features are obtained from DINO-B/8 [11]. We train using batch size of 4 and extract 32 patches of size 8 8 from each image to compute LSceneDINO. Volume rendering samples each ray at = 32 uniformly spaced points in inverse depth within [3 m, 80 m]. We train for 100 steps using Adam [51] with base learning rate of 104. Training takes ca. 2 days on single V100 GPU. We distill using batch size of 4, 5 center points, feature batch of size 576, and cluster with = 19. For kNN sampling, we use = 4. The feature buffer holds 256 feature batches.

SceneDINO achieves (semantic) mIoU of 8.0 % for the range of 51.2 m, significantly improving over our unsupervised baseline (6.6 %). This demonstrates that SceneDINO effectively lifts DINO features into 3D. In terms of geometric accuracy, SceneDINO moderately improves over S4C + STEGO. Despite being fully unsupervised, SceneDINO comes within 2.2 % points mIoU of the 2D-supervised S4C. Fig. 5 provides qualitative samples on SSCBenchKITTI-360. SceneDINOs unsupervised SSC predictions are less noisy and capture finely resolved semantics compared to S4C + STEGO.

In particular, the mIoU of SceneDINO is 2.24 % points higher than for STEGO (w/ DINO). Utilizing 3D refined features from FiT3D deteriorates the baseline relative to DINO, indicating that the FiT3D refinement reduces feature expressiveness. Notably, our unsupervised 3D baseline S4C + STEGO transfers significantly worse to 2D than SceneDINO. We also validate SceneDINO, trained on KITTI-360, on Cityscapes and BDD10K, demonstrating domain generalization. The results are reported in Tab. 3. SceneDINO outperforms all baselines in mIoU on both datasets while only falling short in Acc. S4C + STEGO falls short in generalization. We suspect this poor generalization is caused by the fact that S4C does not rely on general SSL features in the final model, while our feature field generalizes. 4.3.

Analyzing SceneDINO To understand what core components contribute to obtaining an expressive feature field of SceneDINO, we omit or replace individual components and report the results in Tab. 5. Replacing the downsampling approach with bilinear upsampling and multi-crop augmentations, similar to [1], to obtain high-resolution target features leads decrease SSC mIoU by 1.18 %. Omitting the feature smoothness loss leads to similar mIoU drop. Abolishing the constant decomposition of positional encodings leads to mIoU drop of 0.74 %. Training using unsupervised camera poses estimated by ORB-SLAM3 [7] results in an insignificant mIoU drop of only 0.12 %, over using KITTI-360 poses. Going from DINO to DINOv2 target features leads to an increased mIoU of 1.08 %, demonstrating, SceneDINO can benefit from more expressive 2D target features. In Tab. 6, we analyze our 3D distillation. Performing no distillation at all, just clustering our features, decreases mIoU by 1.61 %. Omitting the kNN-correlation loss leads to mIoU drop of 1.35 %.

This demonstrates the effectiveness of performing distillation in 3D using our novel approach. While focusing on unsupervised SSC, we can also linearly probe our distilled feature field (cf . Tab. 7). In particular, we train SceneDINO using different target features (DINO [11] and DINOv2 [11]), perform distillation, and probe the resulting distilled features. Using linear probing, i.e., training single linear layer using 2D semantic labels, leads to consistent mIoU increase over unsupervised probing. SceneDINO trained using DINOv2 target features even closes the gap to S4C, trained using 2D ground-truth semantic labels. We even surpass 2D supervised S4C slightly on the full range (51.2 m), suggesting the effectiveness of SceneDINO also for weakly-supervised tasks. 5. Conclusion to our knowledge, We presented SceneDINO, the first approach for unsupervised semantic scene completion. Trained using multi-view images and 2D DINO features without human supervision, SceneDINO is able to predict an expressive 3D feature field using single input image during inference. Our novel 3D distillation approach yields state-of-the-art results in unsupervised SSC. While we focus on unsupervised SSC, our multi-view feature consistency, linear probing, and domain generalization results highlight the potential of SceneDINO as strong foundation for various 3D scene-understanding tasks.

Sec. A). We discuss our multi-view feature consistency evaluation approach (cf . Sec. B). Next, we provide additional qualitative and quantitative results (cf . Sec. C), including failure cases. Finally, we discuss the limitations of SceneDINO and suggest future research directions (cf . Sec. D). λrand = 0.67, and brand = 0.87. For the similarity thresholds we use bself = 0.44, bkNN = 0.18, and brand = 0.87. We follow standard practice in 2D unsupervised semantic segmentation [17, 31, 32, 50, 77, 91, 94] by applying Hungarian matching [56] to align our pseudo semantics. For SSC validation, we map down to 15 semantic classes while following existing work [31, 32] for 2D validation and map to 19 semantic classes. A. Reproducibility A.2. Datasets Here, we provide further implementation details, information about the utilized dataset, and computational complexity details to ensure reproducibility. Note that our code is available at https://github.com/tum-vision/ scenedino. A.1. Implementation details We implement SceneDINO in PyTorch [122] and build on the code of BTS [107], STEGO [32], and S4C [37]. Our encoder-decoder (pre-trained DINO-B/8 and randomly initialized dense prediction decoder) produces per-pixel embeddings of dimensionality DE = 256. Based on these embeddings, the two-layer MLP ϕ (hidden dimension 128) predicts 64 features. As rendering features is expensive, requiring multiple forward passes through the MLP, ϕ predicts 64 features. We employ another MLP to up-project again to the full dimensionality = 768, this MLP is learn with SceneDINO and can up-project both 3D features and 2D rendered features. We train for 100 steps with base learning rate of 104, dropping to 105 after 50 steps. We train using batch size of 4, extracting 32 patches of size 8 8 per image. These patches align with the per-patch DINO target features. For our feature field loss formulation (cf . Sec. 3.2), we use the loss weights λp = 1, λs = 0.001, λf = 0.2, λfs = 0.25. The MLP head (hidden dimension 768) produces 64 distilled features. We perform distillation for 1000 steps with learning rate of 5 104. We train using batch size of 4, 5 center points, feature batch of size 576, and cluster with = 19. For kNN sampling, we use = 4. The feature buffer holds 256 feature batches. The loss term in Eq. (9) is parameterized with λself = 0.08 λkNN = 0.43 We provide additional details about the datasets utilized to train and evaluate SceneDINO. KITTI-360 [63, 65] provides video sequences from moving vehicle equipped with forward-facing stereo pair and two side-facing fisheye cameras. In future frames, the fisheye views capture additional geometric and semantic cues of regions occluded in the forward-facing view. For training, we resample the fisheye images into perspective projection. We focus on an area approximately 50 meters ahead of the ego vehicle. Assuming an average velocity of 3050 km/h, side views are randomly sampled 14 seconds into the future. Given frame rate of 10 Hz, this translates to 10 40 time steps. Each training sample consists of eight images: four forward-facing views (including the input image) and four side-facing views. To evaluate our predicted field in SSCBench-KITTI360, we follow the evaluation procedure of S4C [37]. The voxel predictions are evaluated in three different ranges: 12.8 12.8 6.4 m, 25.6 25.6 6.4 m, and the full range 51.2 51.2 6.4 m. For each voxel, multiple evenly distributed points are sampled from the semantic field. The predictions are aggregated per voxel by taking the maximum occupancy and weighting the class predictions accordingly. consists of 500 high-resolution and Cityscapes [19] densely annotated validation images of ego-centric driving scenes. For validation, Cityscapes uses 19-class taxonomy. We leverage the Cityscapes validation samples at resolution of 640 192 for our domain generalization experiments (2D semantic segmentation).

We provide additional qualitative results, visualizing the input image, SceneDINOs predicted feature field using the first three principal components, and SSC prediction, the SSC prediction of our baseline S4C+STEGO, and the SSC ground truth. We only visualize surface voxels within the field of view for the sake of clarity. segmentation validation images. The semantic taxonomy follows the 19-class Cityscapes definition. For domain generalization experiments, we utilize BDD-100K images at resolution of 640 192. RealEstate10K [118] is large-scale dataset containing videos of real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, primarily sourced from YouTube. For our experiments, we train with resolution of 512 288. Each training sample consists of three frames, separated by randomly sampled time offset. There are no semantic annotations provided with the dataset. We evaluate the multi-view consistency of our model in this setting. A.3. Computational complexity SceneDINO requires only single GPU for training and inference. In SSCBench (51.2 range), SceneDINO requires 0.760.1 to infer full scene on V100 GPU. The peak VRAM usage during inference is 11 GB. For reference, S4C requires 0.320.13 s. Considering our expressive and high-dimensional feature field and ViT encoder, this is moderate runtime increase. SceneDINO has 100 parameters and is trained for approximately 2 days on single V100 32 GB GPU. All results are reported using automatic mixed precision. B. Multi-View Feature Consistency Evaluation We aim to measure the multi-view consistency of 2D and 3D features. Note, we are not aware of any standardized approach for multi-view feature consistency. To this end, we employ straightforward approach. Given two video frames with temporal stride of 3, forward optical flow is computed using RAFT large [98]. We estimate occlusion by forward-backward consistency [124]; for this, we also compute the backward optical flow. The 2D feature maps obtained using the second frame are backward warped to the features of the first frame. We compute different similarity metrics between the aligned features (L1, L2, and cos-sim). Note that we ignore occlusions. While features from DINO, DINOv2, and FiT3D possess lower resolution than our 2D rendered SceneDINO features, we upscale these features to the image resolution before warping. This evaluation approach utilizes optical flow correspondences and captures both ego motion as well as object motion, offering simple way to evaluate multi-view feature consistency. C. Additional Results Here we provide additional qualitative and quantitative results, extending our results reported in the main paper. Qualitative results.

Failure cases of SceneDINO on KITTI-360. We provide failure cases of SceneDINO. We visualize the input image, the predicted feature field using the first three principal components, the SSC prediction, and the SSC ground truth. We observe that our semantic predictions struggle in shaded regions. We only visualize surface voxels within the field of view for the sake of clarity. Input Image SceneDINO DINO Figure 8. 2D SceneDINO features on KITTI-360. We visualize our 2D rendered features and DINO features for given input image (left). We use the first three principal components for feature visualization. Notably, SceneDINOs features (middle) are smoother and capture finer structures than DINO (right). Additionally, SceneDINOs features are high-resolution, while DINO generates features with stride of 8. tion approach on unsupervised semantic scene completion. We also provide visualizations of our unsupervised SSC baseline, S4C + STEGO. Qualitatively, our approach obtains more accurate SSC results and is able to segment faraway objects, such as cars, better than the S4C + STEGO baseline. This observation aligns with the quantitative results presented in Tab. 1 of the main paper. Figure 8 qualitatively analyzes our 2D rendered feaiii tures against DINO. Our features exhibit smooth appearance for uniform regions, such as sidewalks. Additionally, SceneDINOs features better capture fine structures like poles than DINO features. 2D rendered SceneDINO features are also high resolution in contrast to DINO features that exhibit lower resolution. Failure cases. In Fig. 7, we provide failure cases of SceneDINOs SSC predictions. Our predictions exhibit two common failure cases. First, shadowed regions often lead to wrong semantic predictions. Regions affected by significant brightness changes are breaking the brightness consistency, subsequently offering poor learning signal during training, thus impeding accurate predictions of shadowed regions. Second, objects such as cars can entail tail-like artifacts, not accurately capturing the geometry. As our multiview image and feature reconstruction training cannot handle dynamic objects, tail-like artifacts could be caused by the poor learning signal for dynamic objects. Quantitative results. In Tab. 8, we provide additional semantic scene completion results of 3D supervised approaches as an additional point of comparison. In particular, we report official SSCBench [63] results of VoxFormerS [62] and OccFormer [117]. Both utilize 3D supervision, including both semantic and geometric annotations. We also report the results of SSCNet [95]. This approach trains using 3D supervision but utilizes depth image during inference. While SceneDINO achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy in the unsupervised setting, supervised approaches are significantly more accurate. Table 8. SSCBench-KITTI-360 results. Semantic results using mIoU and per class IoU, and geometric results using IoU, Precision, and Recall (all in %, ) on SSCBench-KITTI-360 test using three depth ranges.

Both approaches share similar confusion pattern. We attribute this to the fact that both approaches rely on the feature representation of DINO. In particular, we observe confusion between semantically close classes, such as pole, traffic light, and traffic sign. Interestingly, for the semantic classes person, rider, car, truck, bus, motorcycle, and bicycle, we see strong confusion. We suspect this correlation is potentially caused by the fact that these classes often appear on the road and sidewalk and are rare in KITTI-360. We also provide class-wise SSC results of SceneDINO using 2D supervised linear probing in Tab. 11. Linear probing provides an upper bound for clustering our features, improving the segmentation accuracy for almost all classes. However, rare classes like motorcycle are still not captured using linear probing. This suggests that the DINO feature space fails to express these classes accurately, limiting the segmentation accuracy of SceneDINO. Still, our approach is agnostic to the utilized target features and can potentially profit from better 2D features. Camera pose analysis. Training SceneDINO, requires accurate camera poses. While KITTI-360 offers ground truth camera poses, these poses are obtained using additional cues, including LiDAR data [65]. To adhere to our fully unsupervised setting, we provide results training with unsupervised camera poses, estimated using stereo visual SLAM. In particular, Tab. 5 reports results of SceneDINO Table 12. Camera pose analysis on SSCBench-KITTI-360. We extend the camera pose analysis in Tab. 5 and report detailed results of SceneDINO with unsupervised camera poses estimated by SOFT2 [121] and ORB-SLAM3 [7].

Table 12, extends these results and reports detailed SSC results using two different unsupervised stereo visual SLAM approachesSOFT2 [121] and ORBSLAM3 [7]. Using unsupervised and visually estimated poses leads to minor drop in both semantic and geometric SSC validation. While ORB-SLAM3 poses lead to slightly better semantic accuracy than SOFT2 poses, SOFT2 estimated poses result in higher geometric accuracy. Still, both SOFT2 and ORB-SLAM3 provide poses accurate enough for train SceneDINO, reaching similar accuracy to employing KITTI-360 poses. Out-of-domain results. We illustrate on out-of-domain prediction in Fig. 10. While our SceneDINO model is trained on the KITTI-360 dataset, we still obtain plausible features when inferring 2D features for vastly different scenes. The 2D rendered features still show strong correlation with semantically uniform regions, showcasing the generalization of our feature field. D. Limitations and Future Work Target features. Our method builds on DINO [11] to obtain target features. While we learn to lift these features into 3D and improve multi-view feature consistency, we cannot improve the discriminative power of the target features per se. However, SceneDINO can be trained using arbitrary 2D target features and can profit from future advances in SSL vi Figure 10. 2D SceneDINO features on out-of-domain images. We visualize our 2D rendered features (right) given an out-ofdomain image (left) from ADE20K [126]. We use the first three principal components for feature visualization. While not trained on such scenes, SceneDINO still produces plausible feature maps. representation. Note that training SceneDINO requires only 2 days on single GPU and our training transfers seamlessly to different target features (e.g., DINOv2), thus, utilizing SceneDINO differently is straightforward. Dynamic objects. Our loss does not model dynamic objects and relies on static scene assumption. This can potentially cause inaccurate predictions for dynamic classes such as person in our experiments. Recent works in depth estimation have explicitly modeled the probability of areas being dynamic [125] and even their motion within the scene [123], which might be extended to SceneDINO. View sampling and camera poses. For sampling views during training, we rely on the sampling scheme of S4C [37]. This is not directly applicable to other nondriving datasets, where the sampling needs to be tuned. In addition, our approach requires accurate camera poses for each view. We demonstrated that these can be obtained in an unsupervised way for KITTI-360 (cf . Tab. 5 & Tab. 12). However, obtaining unsupervised camera poses in more challenging scenarios and conditions is still challenging [120]. Future work. SceneDINO is only trained using single dataset to be comparable to existing SSC approaches. However, scaling our approach to multiple datasets of more variable scenes could lead to more general feature representations. Ultimately, scaling SceneDINO to internet-scale videos might enable strong zero-shot and cross-domain 3D scene understanding."
