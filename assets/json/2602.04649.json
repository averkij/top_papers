            "content": "Recent studies observe phenomenon where reward models achieve high accuracy on static datasets but fail to generalize effectively during RLHF (Gao et al., 2023; Casper et al., 2023; Lambert et al., 2024). We attribute this to the reliance on outcome supervision, where the model is optimized solely to predict human-annotated binary preferences. Models trained this way tend to learn spurious correlations or shortcuts to maximize Outcome Accuracy without genuine reasoning (Anand et al., 2024; Geirhos et al., 2020; Uesato et al., 2022), leading to the Deceptive Alignment of the RM (Hubinger et al., 2019; Carlsmith, 2023), where the RM predicts the right label but for the wrong reasons. The recent emergence of Generative RMs (GenRM, Liu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025) and LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024), which generate rationales prior to the final judgment, enables us to explicitly examine the reasoning process. Therefore, we argue for the critical importance of rationale supervision, ensuring that the RMs reasoning process matches human judgment. We introduce Rationale Consistency, fine-grained evaluation metric designed to verify the alignment between the models evaluation process and human judgment. To measure this with precision, we construct METAJUDGE, framework that decomposes human rationales into mutually exclusive atomic units, prompts the model to output corresponding list of rationales, and employs an LLM to perform strict one-to-one semantic matching, thereby quantifying the exact proportion of human rationales recovered by the model. Through comprehensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art LLMs, we identify critical disconnect between the correctness of models outcome and the validity of its judgment, as shown in Figure 1. This disconnect manifests in two key limitations: (1) Outcome accuracy masks deceptive alignment. We find that high outcome accuracy does not guarantee robust judgment. striking example is the contrast between o3 (OpenAI, 2025d) and o3-mini (OpenAI, 2025c): despite comparable outcome accuracy, their judgment logic differs fundamentally. While o3 identifies specific, latent flaws similar to human judges, o3-mini frequently relies on superficial, vague justifications without detecting actual defects (see Table 1). (2) Outcome accuracy is approaching saturation point. Outcome accuracy cannot cleanly separate frontier models such as GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025b) and Gemini 3 Pro (Google DeepMind, 2025b) from the rest of the evaluated models, while rationale consistency remains highly discriminative. To mitigate this gap, we train GenRMs with Group Relative Policy Optimization (Shao et al., 2024) using hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy. Unlike traditional objectives that encourage only outcome correctness, we enforce hierarchical supervision: the model is rewarded only when it provides both the correct outcome and the correct rationale. Our approach yields significant gains: (1) it achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging benchmarks, reaching 87.1% on RM-Bench (Liu et al., 2024b) and 82.0% on JudgeBench (Tan et al., 2024), and outperforming outcome-only baselines by 3% and 7% respectively; and (2) when used as the reward model in RLHF, it further improves performance on Arena Hard v2 (Li et al., 2024b), delivering 7% boost on Creative Writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our training method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training (rationale consistency improving from 25% to 37%)."

            "content": "This section introduces METAJUDGE, framework for measuring the alignment between LLMs judgment processes and human reasoning, i.e., Rationale Consistency. We first describe how to construct an atomic rationale benchmark, then present an evaluation procedure in which an LLM performs strict one-to-one semantic matching between model-generated and human atomic rationales. Finally, we formalize the Rationale Consistency metric. Table 1 illustrates the full pipeline with concrete example. 2.1 Benchmark Construction We construct an atomic-rationale benchmark from HelpSteer3 (Wang et al., 2025c), an expert-annotated human preference dataset spanning general conversation, code, STEM, and multilingual tasks. Each instance contains query x, two responses (y1, y2), detailed human rationale, and preference label l. Because free-form rationales Run are difficult to compare directly with model-generated reasons, we apply an Atomic Decomposition pipeline inspired by prior fine-grained evaluation work (Sun et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024). Specifically, we sample 250 examples from each domain and use GPT-5 to decompose each free-form rationale Run into atomic rationales Rh = {r1, . . . , rn}. The decomposition follows two principles: (i) retain concrete, evidence-grounded rationale while filtering generic subjective statements, and (ii) 2 User Prompt: write me powerful ads for Tips, play your game in advance to relieve stress. count limit Response (Complete Text) Response (Complete Text) 1. \"Feeling stressed?

Accuracy Scores Final Decision: < (Ground Truth) Selected Generated Reasons: Response explicitly formats the ads as \"Under 100 Characters,\" addressing the count limit, whereas does not reference character count. Response Bs use of emoji enhances appeal and modern ad style. Response lacks clear separation between different ad versions, while clearly labels each option. Analysis: The model focuses on surface formatting. It criticizes for not \"referencing\" the count (formatting), rather than verifying the actual length (factual check). It praises emojis (style) but misses the critical \"Tips\" keyword omission in and the missing \"in advance\" logic in B. Final Decision: < Outcome Score: 1/1 = 100% (Matched) Rationale Score: 0/4 = 0% (Missed R1, R2, R3, R4) Selected Generated Reasons: breaks the \"count limit 100\" instruction; at least two ads are 110-120 chars long, while keeps every option under 100. (Hit R3) never mentions the product name \"Tips\"; explicitly builds every slogan around \"Tips\". (Hit R1) Although uses \"play in advance,\" it fails major constraints; omits that wording but follows length/name constraints better. (Hit R4) Analysis: The model performs factual verification (counting characters) matching R3. It identifies the missing keyword \"Tips\" (matching R1). Crucially, it recognizes the trade-off: is better despite missing the \"in advance\" concept (matching R4).

Note that both models make the same final decision, but o3-mini follows surface cues (formatting, emojis) with 0% Rationale Consistency, while o3 follows factual verification with 75%. The analysis provides fine-grained breakdown for each reason. remove redundancy so each item forms single independent semantic unit. We manually inspect 93 randomly sampled cases and find the atomic rationales faithfully reflect the original human rationale. The decomposition prompt and benchmark statistics are provided in Appendix A. Appendix A.3 further provides case studies showing that this process effectively produces evidence-grounded, non-redundant checklists, supporting high-quality fine-grained evaluation. We filter instances to retain 37 critique points, as we observe that having too many or too few rationales often indicates clearly low-quality feedback. We name the resulting benchmark HelpSteer3-Atomic. To further strengthen evaluation, we create CW-Atomic, where human annotators label 350 creativewriting samples in the same atomic format. Each example is annotated by three annotators; instances with annotator disagreement are removed, resulting in 207 high-quality test cases. See Appendix for details on CW-Atomics annotation and construction. Notably, this annotation process does not introduce additional burden beyond asking annotators to organize their rationales into an atomic, evidence-grounded format. Recent studies (Wang et al., 2024; 2025c) on reward-model annotation show that eliciting rationales is an important way to ensure labeling quality: requiring annotators to provide reasons encourages more careful evaluation of the context and trade-offs, leading to more reliable outcomes. Our work further shows that this rationale information can also be used as supervision signals for training and evaluating models. 2.2 LLM-based Semantic Matching To enable reliable rationale evaluation, we use an LLM to perform fine-grained semantic matching between human atomic reasons Rh and AI-generated atomic reasons Rai (the AI is required to list atomic reasons in order of importance before giving the final verdict). For each human reason ri Rh, the evaluator matches it against Rai and assigns fulfillment score sij [0, 1]: 1 indicates fully matched reason with consistent key conditions/evidence, while 0 indicates the issue is missing, contradicted, or stated only in generic, non-localized manner. Appendix C.1 provides the prompt template, Appendix C.2 includes additional examples illustrating the detailed evaluation. 2.3 Rationale Consistency Metrics To prevent models from gaming the metric by generating single broad reason that simultaneously matches multiple human reasons, we impose strict one-to-one matching constraint: Stotal = max π (i,j)π sij (1) where π is matching set such that any reason in Rh and Rai appears at most once in π. Under this constraint, each AI reason can be matched to at most one best-matching human reason. Based on the global optimal matching score Stotal, we define Rationale Consistency as the mean soft recall over samples: RC = 1 N k=1 (k) total (k) . (2) Additionally, since the length of reason lists output by different models varies, during the evaluation phase, we enforce all models to output fixed-length list of reasons (e.g., Top-5). This limits the output budget to test the models ability to identify key reasons. We do not impose this constraint during training."

            "content": "3.1 Beyond Outcome Accuracy We conduct large-scale evaluation of 19 frontier LLMs released over the past year, employing Qwen3 Plus1 (Yang et al., 2025) as the MetaJudge evaluator. Figure 1 visualizes the performance distribution of all models on the Helpsteer3-Atomic benchmark across outcome accuracy and rationale consistency (evaluation results for each subcategory are provided in Appendix C.3). While outcome accuracy and rationale consistency are generally positively correlated, analyzing models through the lens of rationale consistency exposes two key weaknesses of outcome accuracy that it fails to reveal. 1. Limited Differentiation for Frontier Models. In the green region, rationale consistency clearly distinguishes stronger frontier models (e.g., GPT-5, o3, Gemini 3 Pro) from weaker ones (e.g., Claude 3.5, GPT-4.1, Gemini 3 Flash), even when they achieve similar outcome accuracy.2 This indicates that many models can attain comparable outcome accuracy, but only the most advanced models consistently follow judgment logic that aligns with humans and produce rationales matching the key reasons identified by humans; rationale consistency therefore provides more reliable signal of human-aligned judgment. 2. The Deceptive Alignment Trap. striking divergence in Figure 1 appears in the Deceptive Alignment Trap (red zone), most notably between models from the same family, o3 and o3-mini. They achieve similar outcome accuracy, yet o3-minis rationale consistency is almost 50% lower. similar pattern is observed between Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash: the Flash model reaches comparable outcome accuracy, but its rationale consistency is substantially lower. This shows that outcome accuracy cannot effectively detect deceptive alignment. We illustrate this gap with case study in Table 1. Although o3-mini selects the preferred answer, its rationale does not match human reasoning. Humans and o3 explicitly check the strict word-count constraint, whereas o3-mini relies on superficial cues (e.g., self-claimed compliance, emojis) and fails to verify the constraint. This shows that model can make the correct choice for the wrong reasons, which outcome accuracy alone cannot detect without rationale consistency. Overall, even the most advanced models achieve rationale consistency of only around 0.4, indicating substantial room for improvement in aligning model judgment logic with human reasoning. Recent work (Ye et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2024) has explored using LLMs to synthesize human preferences. While this reduces annotation cost, it also risks mismatches with human judgment logic, falling into deceptive 1Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 2Model references: GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025b); o3 (OpenAI, 2025d); GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025a); Gemini 3 Pro (Google DeepMind, 2025b); Gemini 3 Flash (Google DeepMind, 2025a); Claude 3.5 (Anthropic, 2024). 4 alignment trap. For the foreseeable future, human annotation will still be necessary to achieve genuine alignment with humans. (a) (b) Figure 2: (a) Insensitivity to the Evaluator Model: Rationale consistency computed by different evaluators are highly correlated (R2 = 0.983). (b) Generalization Across Domains and Annotators: Model rankings remain largely consistent between HelpSteer3-Atomic and CW-Atomic (Spearman ρ = 0.85). 3.2 Measurement Reliability We assess the reliability of rationale consistency along two axes: sensitivity to the evaluator and robustness across domains and annotators. Overall, we find that rationale consistency can be evaluated robustly: scores are largely insensitive to the evaluator model and generalize well across domains and annotator groups. Insensitive to the Evaluator Model. Because MetaJudge relies on an LLM evaluator, key concern is evaluator-dependent bias. We therefore compare Qwen-Plus (a relatively weak, non-reasoning model) with DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) (a stronger reasoning model). As shown in Figure 2a, their scores are highly consistent (R2 = 0.983, RMSE = 0.006). This is expected because the evaluator mainly performs semantic matching of reasons, which is relatively lightweight; as result, even non-reasoning model can serve as reliable evaluator and produce scores comparable to those from an expert-level judge. Generalization Across Domains and Annotators. To test whether rationale consistency generalizes across different annotators and domains, we further evaluate multiple models on the CW-Atomic benchmark for creative writing, which is annotated by different group of annotators and covers new domain compared with HelpSteer3-Atomic. Figure 2b shows that model rankings remain largely consistent across the two benchmarks (Spearman ρ = 0.85), indicating that rationale consistency is stable and can reliably distinguish stronger from weaker models across domains and annotator pools. At the same time, rationale consistency still reflects domain-specific strengths (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5 rises to #1 in creative writing), consistent with prior evaluations highlighting its advantage on creative-writing tasks (Paech, 2023)."

            "title": "4 Generative Reward Modeling Based on Rationale Consistency",
            "content": "Since outcome-only supervision cannot effectively align the models reasoning process with human judgment, we incorporate rationale supervision into the training of GenRM. 4.1 Training Objective Outcome Reward. Generative reward modeling primarily relies on outcome supervision (Liu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025). For given input (x, y1, y2) and the model-generated judgment youtcome, we define the outcome accuracy reward Routcome as binary signal: Routcome = 1 if the models prediction matches the human label, and 0 otherwise. 5 Rationale Reward. We treat the sequence of atomic reasons generated by the model as an ordered list. To prioritize the importance of human-aligned reasons, we employ Average Precision (AP, Manning et al., 2008) as the rationale reward Rrationale: Rrationale = AP = Rai k=1 (P@k I(k)) Rh (3) where P@k denotes the precision at rank k, and I(k) is an indicator function derived from the graph matching results (taking the value 1 if the k-th reason belongs to the optimal matching set π, and 0 otherwise). Unlike F1 score, which treats outputs as unordered sets, the core advantage of AP lies in the introduction of Soft Ranking Constraint. It not only requires the model to retrieve comprehensive reasons but also incentivizes placing core reasons aligned with human cognition at the top of the rationale list. This provides smoother and prioritized gradient signal for reinforcement learning. Hybrid Reward. To address the issue of deceptive alignment, where the model predicts the correct outcome based on fallacious logic, we propose hybrid reward function Rfinal: Rfinal = Rrationale Routcome This multiplicative form implements gating mechanism: correct reasoning is necessary condition for obtaining high reward, even when the final outcome is correct. (4) Optimization Algorithm. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO, Shao et al., 2024) to maximize the aforementioned rewards. For each query q, GRPO samples group of outputs {o1, o2, ..., oG} and optimizes the policy based on intra-group relative advantages. The objective function is defined as follows: (θ) = q,{oi} (cid:34) 1 i=1 (cid:18) πθ(oiq) πold(oiq) (cid:19)(cid:35) ˆAi βD KL (5) where ˆAi is the advantage computed by standardizing the rewards within the group, β denotes the KL divergence coefficient, and πref is the reference model. 4.2 Experimental Settings We follow the Atomic Decomposition method in Section 2.1, converting all HelpSteer3 rationales into structured atomic rationale checklists as supervision. For efficiency, we use Qwen3-Turbo3 as the MetaJudge to provide fast training-time reward. Our training methodology aligns with that of Guo et al. (2025), modifying only the source of the reward signals. We conduct training and comparison based on two powerful base models, Qwen3-14B and Qwen3-30B-A3B, and evaluate on two complementary and challenging benchmarks. RM-Bench (Liu et al., 2024b) measures models ability to discriminate subtle differences and style biases across Chat, Code, Math, and Safety. JudgeBench (Tan et al., 2024) emphasizes deep judgment and logical reasoning on challenging Knowledge and Reasoning tasks. Detailed hyperparameter settings are provided in Appendix D. 4.3 Generative Reward Modeling To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct strict controlled comparison using the same training pipeline, differing only in the reward signal: Ours uses Rfinal = Rrationale Routcome, while the baseline Outcome-Only uses Routcome alone. As shown in Table 2, incorporating rationale reward leads to consistent and substantial performance gains. From an overall metric perspective, our method demonstrates exceptional robustness across model scales. Qwen3-14B (Ours) improves the Total Average score from the baselines 76.8% to 82.9%, while Qwen330B-A3B (Ours) further advances from 80.3% to 84.6%. Notably, on JudgeBench, both models achieve an improvement magnitude exceeding 7%. This performance gain indicates that the supervision signals provided by rationale consistency effectively enhance the models discriminative capability, particularly in domains requiring deep and complex reasoning. Furthermore, given that HelpSteer3 includes code-related data, we observe substantial gains on the code domain in both benchmarks. This large gap suggests that outcome accuracy-only training does not teach the model reliable notion of code correctness, whereas rationale consistency-based training enables the model to genuinely verify code logic and accuracy. 3Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 6 Table 2: Dark gray and shade gray highlight the best and second-best performance, respectively.

We further compare against state-of-the-art Generative Reward Models (Yu et al., 2025), Scalar Reward Models (Liu et al., 2024a), and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines. Qwen330B-A3B (Ours) achieves an overall average score of 84.6%, outperforming all competitors, including the recent strong GRAM-R2 (Wang et al., 2025a) (83.4%) and Principles-Qwen32B (Wang et al., 2025b) (83.8%). GRAM-R2 adopts data augmentation and is trained on mixture of over one million (1M+) external preference and reasoning samples, aggregating datasets from StackExchange and PKU-SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2024), which strengthens its discrimination on Knowledge and Safety. Principles-Qwen32B reduces the difficulty of discrimination by annotating set of judgment principles and identifying the principles that apply. In contrast, our method substantially improves the quality of the supervision signal, enabling the model to effectively learn judgment logic that is consistent with human reasoning. Ablation Note: We attempt training using only Rrationale. However, this leads to reward hacking mode where, lacking an incentive signal for the final outcome, the model generates results inconsistent with its own reasoning process. Thus, the hybrid signal is essential. 4.4 Utilizing Reward Model in RLHF To assess GenRMs ability to guide LLM optimization, we plug it into an RLHF pipeline. Starting from Qwen-30B-A3B-Base, we apply small amount of SFT for basic instruction following, then align the SFT model using either Qwen-30B-A3B (Ours) or Qwen-30B-A3B (Outcome only) as the reward model (see Appendix for hyperparameters). We evaluate on Arena Hard v2 (Li et al., 2024b), which includes Hard Prompt and Creative Writing. As shown in Table 3, reward-guided alignment substantially improves over SFT (from 12.61%/41.12% to 21.22%/69.08%). Moreover, our hybrid reward consistently outperforms the outcome-only baseline on both subsets, with 7% gain on Creative Writing. We attribute this to implicit constraints in creative writing prompts (e.g., required elements, strict word limits): outcome-only rewards are easier to game, while rationale consistency provides finer-grained supervision that encourages more careful judgment and yields better downstream alignment. 4.5 Escaping the Deceptive Alignment Trap We evaluate rationale consistency for both methods and uncover key finding: outcome-only supervision can improve agreement with human decisions, yet the underlying judgment process increasingly 7 Table 3: Evaluation results on Arena Hard v2. The results show that the GenRM trained with our method better aligns the LLM than the baseline. Table 4: Ablation study on Rationale Consistency. Our method improves rationale consistency, whereas outcome-only training leads to rationale degradation.

CW-Atomic Score 0.2385 0.1677 0.2526 - 0.0708 0.0141 diverges from human logic. In contrast, our method substantially improves alignment with human judgment logic, and this improvement generalizes across domains. Rationale Consistency Evaluation. We use DeepSeek R1 as the MetaJudge evaluator to measure rationale consistency for models trained with outcome-only vs. rationale-outcome supervision on HelpSteer3-Atomic and CW-Atomic. As shown in Table 4, outcome-only reduces rationale consistency relative to the Base model by 3.97% (in-domain HelpSteer3-Atomic) and 7.08% (out-of-domain CW-Atomic). In contrast, rationale-outcome supervision improves rationale consistency by +12.13% on HelpSteer3-Atomic (in-domain) and +1.4% on CW-Atomic (out-of-domain), indicating tighter alignment with human judgment logic and better out-of-domain generalization. Training Dynamics: Similar Outcome Reward, Divergent Rationale Reward. Figure 3 compares training dynamics. Outcome rewards are nearly identical for both methods, suggesting that selecting the correct answer can be learned from outcome-only signals without preserving rich judgment process. Rationale rewards, however, diverge: without rationale-consistency constraint, the outcome-only models rationale reward steadily drops and ends up about 24.2% below ours. Inspecting the rationales shows that, when intermediate judgment is not incentivized, the model discards costly verification and relies on cheaper surrogate cues that still achieve similar outcome rewards. We refer to this as Rationale Degeneration, which explains why outcome-only training can look aligned at the outcome level while drifting at the logic level. Figure 3: While outcome accuracy remains comparable across methods, the absence of rationale supervision causes significant collapse in reasoning quality. Rationale Degeneration. We categorize atomic rationales into Evidence-Grounded (EG), CriterionGrounded (CG), and Generic/Style (GS), and track how their distribution changes (Figure 4). Even without training, models mostly produce EG rationales that cite concrete evidence (e.g., the exact location of an error). Under outcome-only optimization, the model shifts away from evidence toward (1) vague CG statements that sound professional but do not localize the issue (e.g., the code has logical error), and (2) GS broad, generic justifications such as Response is more detailed. Because the outcome reward is gamable binary signal, careful evidence checking correlates weakly with reward, so the model increasingly relies on superficial cues, gradually hollowing out the evaluation process. In contrast, our method further increases the proportion of EG rationales, encouraging evidence-based judgments. 8 Figure 4: Degeneration and recovery of reasoning. Outcome-only training degrades rationales into superficial shortcuts: Criterion-Grounded (CG) and Generic/Style (GS). In contrast, our method successfully restores Evidence-Grounded (EG) reasoning to 98.7%. To evaluate the quality of model rationales in detail, we define seven flaw tags (F1F7) to capture common failure patterns in comparative judgments. We use DeepSeek-R1 to label each item in the models list of reasons. F1 Style Only: focuses on format, length, or tone rather than content. F2 Generic Correctness: claims one response is more correct without citing evidence. F3 Generic Relevance: claims one response is more relevant without pointing to specific content. F4 Single-Sided Praise: praises one response without comparing it to the other. F5 Unfalsifiable: cannot be verified or refuted from the given responses. F6 Non Sequitur: the conclusion does not follow from the stated premises. F7 Contradiction: conflicts with other statements in the same rationale. Figure 5: Item-level rationale flaw rates for three settings. Outcome-only training amplifies these flaws, while adding rationale supervision reduces them across the board. Figure 5 shows which flaws are amplified or reduced by different training signals. Outcome-only reward strongly amplifies shortcut rationales. The largest increase is F4 Single-Sided Praise, from 17.76% to 61.97%. This suggests the model often decides the winner first and then praises it without real comparison. F1 Style Only also increases substantially, indicating heavier reliance on surface cues. F5 Unfalsifiable increases as well, showing more vague claims that are hard to check. When we include rationale consistency in the reward, these amplified flaws drop sharply. F4 falls to 0.05%, almost eliminating one-sided arguments. F1 returns close to the pre-training level. F2, F3, and F5 also drop to near zero. Overall, rationale supervision reduces shallow heuristics and encourages evidence-based, truly comparative reasoning."

            "content": "Generative Reward Models and LLM-as-a-Judge. To mitigate the opacity of scalar reward models (Ouyang et al., 2022), research has shifted toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm (Zheng et al., 2023). While models like Prometheus (Kim et al., 2024) and Auto-J (Li et al., 2024a) enhance interpretability via Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and recent works optimize these traces using RL (Guo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), subjective evaluation remains prone to post-hoc rationalization. Here, CoT often justifies biased decision rather than serving as the causal basis for the verdict (Bentham et al., 2024). 9 Critique. Critique-based methods (e.g., Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023)) represent an alignment direction parallel to reward modeling. Benchmarks such as CritiqueBench (Lin et al., 2024) and RealCritic (Tang et al., 2025) evaluate critique quality, which is closely related to our idea. We further turn such critique evaluation into supervision signals for reward modeling. Nevertheless, because critiques are provided as text feedback, they are difficult to use effectively in reinforcement learning. Meta-Verification. Meta-verification has proven effective in objective domains; for instance, DeepSeekMathV2 (Shao et al., 2025) employs meta-verifier to penalize hallucinated defects in mathematical reasoning. We extend this rigorous consistency check to the subjective domain of value alignment. The concurrent work RM-NLHF (Wang et al., 2026) also leverages natural language feedback for process supervision, it relies on the semantic similarity of critiques, whereas our approach enforces strict atomic rationale matching. This decomposition reduces the complexity of consistency verification, yielding robust and reliable metric that ensures stability in both training and evaluation. Process Supervision vs. Rationale Supervision. Our Rationale Reward is distinct from Process Reward Models (PRMs, Lightman et al., 2024). While PRMs supervise the Solvers intermediate steps to prevent logical errors, we target the Judge. We do not supervise solution derivation, but rather the logical faithfulness of the evaluation itself, requiring the judges rationales to structurally necessitate its final label to mitigate deceptive alignment."

            "content": "We find that outcome-only supervision can mask deceptive alignment in GenRM and LLM-as-a-judge settings: models may match human decisions while relying on incorrect rationales. We propose Rationale Consistency and use METAJUDGE to measure it reliably. This metric effectively exposes deceptive alignment and differentiates strong models. To mitigate deceptive alignment, we further study adding rationale supervision during GenRM training, and find that it significantly improves GenRM performance, achieves SOTA results on benchmarks, and substantially increases the reliability of logic-based verification."

            "title": "7 Limitations",
            "content": "Computing rationale consistency in this work still requires high-quality human annotations, which limits scalability. While prior work has explored using LLMs to synthesize human preferences, it remains unclear whether such signals preserve human judgment logic. As we show, even the strongest frontier models achieve under 40% consistency with human rationales, suggesting that current LLMs are not yet reliable substitutes for humans in this role. Consequently, scaling rationale-consistency supervision without sacrificing faithfulness likely requires new advances, such as more robust methods for validating the human-likeness of synthetic rationales or more effective human and AI collaborative annotation protocols."

            "content": "A.1 Atomic Decomposition To construct the atomic rationale benchmark, we apply an Atomic Decomposition process that converts raw evaluator feedback into specific checklist items. As shown in Figure 6, it takes the full evaluation context, keeps evidence-grounded and concrete points, resolves conflicts, and removes redundancy, producing list of atomic rationales along with discarded subjective or invalid statements. Decomposition Prompt System Instruction: You are an assistant for extracting and concretizing key points. Based on the Evaluation Content, structurally summarize the Brief Evaluation Summary, keeping only specific, constructive points that can be directly supported by the evaluation content. You may add details from the evaluation content; remove subjective and vague comments; merge duplicate points. Input Format: <INPUT START> [Evaluation Content] <history>{history}</history> <query>{query}</query> <response 1>{response_1}</response 1> <response 2>{response_2}</response 2> [Brief Evaluation Summary]{str_brief} [Evaluation Content]{str_eval} <INPUT END> Rules: 1. Each output point must be specific and directly evidenced by the evaluation content; include elements such as object/step/metric, and provide numbers, conditions, ranges, times, or examples whenever possible. 2. Keep only problem/error-type points that can improve the content; ignore neutral statements. 3. Remove vague descriptions (e.g., overall poor, needs improvement, may have issues, average performance). 4. You may use the evaluation content to supplement details to concretize vague statements; if it still cannot be concretized, ignore that summary sentence. 5. Each point should be simple, specific, and clear. Merge duplicate or synonymous points, keeping the more specific version. 6. If no specific points can be extracted, output an empty list and explain the reason. 7. If there are conflicting statements in the evaluation summary, ignore them and explain the reason. Important Notes: It is absolutely forbidden to output any content not mentioned in the [Brief Evaluation Summary]! Absolutely no independent evaluation; only rewrite the [Brief Evaluation Summary]. Output Format: <RESULT_START> CLAIM_COUNT=integer CLAIMS: - C1: specific point text - C2: specific point text IGNORED_SUMMARY: - Ignored sentence 1 (Reason: ...) <RESULT_END> Figure 6: The complete prompt used for rationale decomposition. The prompt instructs the model to extract specific, evidence-based evaluation points while filtering out vague, subjective, or conflicting statements. A.2 Benchmark Statistics This section reports benchmark statistics, focusing on the distribution of checklist items across domains. The benchmark contains 1,000 instances spanning four domains: Code, General, Multilingual, and STEM. Table 5 summarizes checklist statistics across domains. The benchmark includes 1,000 instances (250 per domain). The average number of items per instance ranges from 4.08 (Multilingual) to 4.58 (Code), and is constrained to [3, 7] by our filtering rules that remove trivial or overly complex cases. Code and STEM have slightly higher averages (4.58 and 4.54), reflecting more extractable technical critiques. 14 Case Study 1: Factual Verification Task (Margaret Thatcher Hypnosis Query) Context (Conversation History): [User]: Did Margaret Thatcher hypnotize her cabinet ministers? [Assistant]: There is no credible evidence that Margaret Thatcher hypnotized her cabinet ministers. This is rumor or conspiracy theory that has circulated over the years, but there is no factual basis for it. Lack of evidence: There are no firsthand accounts from cabinet members, no documentation, and no reputable sources that support the claim. Hypnosis limitations: Hypnosis cannot force someone to do something against their will. Thatchers personality: While Thatcher was strong and determined leader, she was also known for her intellect and her ability to persuade through logic and argument. Its important to be critical of information and to rely on credible sources. [User]: Geoffrey Hurd did admit that he was hypnotized by Thatcher on multiple occasions. Response 1: Geoffrey Howe, not Geoffrey Hurd, may have made comment about being mesmerized by Margaret Thatcher. Its important to note that that comment was not claim that he had been hypnotized, but rather metaphor to describe how strongly he felt her influence, charisma and leadership. It is important to be clear about the difference between metaphorical language and literal claims: things said to give an idea of their impact and things that are factual descriptions of what happened. Response 2: am not familiar with person named Geoffrey Hurd from the late 20th Century. Geoffrey Howe was Margaret Thatchers Chancellor of the Exchequer (1979-83), Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1983-9), and Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister (1989-90). However, no sources support the notion that he was ever hypnotized by Margaret Thatcher. Original Evaluator Feedback (3 evaluators): Evaluator 1 Reasoning: @Response 2 is better than @Response 1 because its less subjective. It challenges the Geoffrey Hurd fallacy straightforwardly, gives authentic data on Geoffrey Howes occupation. Feedback1: partially helpful, does not state Geoffrey Hurd was misidentified. Feedback2: mostly helpful. Evaluator 2 Reasoning: @Response 2 is much better. Response 1 states Geoffrey Howe may have said mesmerized but no evidence exists. The metaphorical vs literal discussion is unnecessary and irrelevant. Evaluator 3 Reasoning: @Response 1 is not factually accurate. The response states Geoffrey Howe said he was mesmerized by Thatcher, but there are no sources to show that this is true. Extracted Checklist (3 items): 1. @Response 1 makes an unsupported claim that Geoffrey Howe may have said he was mesmerized by Thatcher; evaluators note there are no sources/evidence for this statement. 2. @Response 1 does not directly refute the users hypnosis claim, leaving the false premise unaddressed and failing to thoroughly deny the prompt. 3. @Response 1 includes an unnecessary and irrelevant discussion distinguishing metaphorical versus literal claims, which does not serve the task. Ignored Statements (selected examples): @Response 2 is better than @Response 1 because its less subjective... (Reason: subjective evaluation) Geoffreys actual first name was Douglas. (Reason: extraneous; not critique of the responses) It accurately cites the correct person, Geoffrey Howe... (Reason: conflicts with another statement claiming @Response 1 failed to note the misidentification) Figure 7: Factual verification task demonstrating rationale decomposition. The user makes false claim about Geoffrey Hurd being hypnotized. Three evaluators identify issues with Response 1s unsupported claims and irrelevant discussion. The decomposition process extracts 3 specific, actionable checklist items while filtering out subjective or vague statements. 15 Case Study 2: Factual Query Task (TV Series Continuum) Context (Conversation History): [User]: can you tell me the diffrent plots thru the diffrent season of continuum [Assistant]: Certainly! Continuum is Canadian science fiction television series... [provides season-byseason plot summaries for Seasons 1-4] [User]: which season are people having there minds wipe and over written with worker profile for failure to pay taxes Response 1: The plotline youre referring to is from Season 2, specifically, the episode titled Second Time (Season 2, Episode 13). However, the reason why peoples minds were wiped wasnt for failure to pay taxes. In the episode, its revealed how and why Keira ended up traveling back in time and that it was Elder Alec who wiped her mind to cover up Grapefruits murder. This episode also revealed Alec as Jasons father. Response 2: The plotline youre referring to is from Season 2, specifically in the episode titled Second Time (Season 2, Episode 13). In this episode, Kiera and Carlos investigate series of mysterious deaths where the victims minds are wiped and overwritten with worker profile. This is part of larger scheme by corporation called Piron to implement new form of debt collection and social control in the future... Note that failure to pay taxes is not part of the plot of the Second Time episode. Original Evaluator Feedback (3 evaluators): Evaluator 1: @Response 1 is better... does not hallucinate. Feedback1: sponse also has hallucinates and makes up the plot that Kiera and Carlos investigate series of mysterious deaths in which the victims minds are wiped and overwritten with worker profile. irrelevant information about Jasons fathers reveal. Feedback2: The reThe model Evaluator 2: @Response 1 responds correctly without misinformation. Feedback2: The response says the mind wipe was for form of debt collection but no sources support that claim... concise. @Response 1 is Feedback2: Evaluator 3: The response is bit confusing... Social control is mentioned several times, which adds to the difficulty in reading the response. Extracted Checklist (4 items): 1. Response 1 includes irrelevant information about Jasons father being revealed, which is not needed to answer the users query. 2. Response 2 hallucinates plot details by claiming Kiera and Carlos investigate series of mysterious deaths where victims minds are wiped and overwritten with worker profile in Season 2, Episode 13. 3. Response 2 incorrectly asserts the mind wipe was part of debt-collection/social-control scheme; the evaluation notes no sources support this claim. 4. Response 2 is overly verbose and confusing due to irrelevant content and repeated mentions of social control. Ignored Statements (selected examples): @Response 1 is better than @Response 2. (Reason: subjective evaluation) The response is perfectly helpful. (Reason: subjective) The response correctly identifies the episode. (Reason: no detail) Figure 8: Factual query task demonstrating decomposition with issues in both responses. The user asks about TV series plotline. Response 1 includes irrelevant information, while Response 2 hallucinates plot details. The decomposition extracts 4 actionable items.

Given the full evaluation context (conversation, candidate responses, and three evaluators comments), the decomposer (i) grounds each item in specific response evidence, (ii) rewrites vague impressions into concrete, verifiable issues, (iii) resolves cross-evaluator conflicts by keeping only consistent critiques, and (iv) removes redundancy and purely subjective statements. The output is an atomic checklist that isolates the key failure modes (e.g., unsupported factual claims, irrelevant discussion, hallucinated plot details, and verbosity/confusion), along with record of discarded statements that are subjective, extraneous, or contradictory."

            "title": "C MetaJudge",
            "content": "C.1 Prompt Template MetaJudge is designed to evaluate the consistency between model-generated critiques and human expert checklists. Given an original evaluation list (model-generated) and reference evaluation list (human checklist), MetaJudge determines the extent to which each item in the original list achieves the intended purpose/improvement goal of each item in the reference list. See Figure 9 for the MetaJudge prompt used for strict one-to-one semantic matching and scoring. C.2 Case Study of MetaJudge Case studies in Table 6 and Table 7 highlight that outcome-level agreement can mask substantial differences in rationale alignment. In Case 1 (creative writing), both gemini-2.0-flash and deepseek-r1-0528 prefer over A, yet gemini-2.0-flash provides largely generic or non-diagnostic critiques (e.g., better plot), only weakly touching the key issue of character confusion and missing the prompt-misalignment and setting-development points (8.3% consistency). In contrast, deepseek-r1-0528 explicitly identifies all three human checklist items with localized evidence, achieving 100% consistency. In Case 2 (factchecking), deepseek-r1 not only misses the human checklist but also reverses the critique by praising As unsupported speculation and defending irrelevant discussion, leading to an incorrect final decision and 0% consistency; gpt-5, however, flags the unsupported claim, directly addresses the false premise, and marks the tangential reasoning, reaching 100% consistency. Together, these examples show that fine-grained semantic matching captures whether models judgment process matches human reasoning, beyond the final preference label. 17 MetaJudge Evaluation Prompt You are rigorous achievement-rate analyst. Given an original evaluation list and reference evaluation list (both are lists of reason points), please judge to what extent each item in the original evaluation list expresses the intended purpose/improvement goal of each reason in the reference evaluation list, and provide an achievement score (01) based on semantic importance. Different expressions with the same meaning should be considered equivalent, but merely mentioning something semantically without achieving the purpose should be considered as not achieved. Abstract or vague descriptions of weaknesses/problems should be considered as not achieved. [Original Evaluation List Start] {source_list} [Original Evaluation List End] [Reference Evaluation List Start] {target_list} [Reference Evaluation List End] For each item in the reference evaluation list, find the best matching single item in the original evaluation list (if no match exists, consider it as not achieved, match R0). Calculate the achievement score (c value) using the following criteria, applying strict matching and prioritizing low scores: Not Achieved / Contradictory: 0.0 The detailed process does not address this evaluations goal, or provides opposite conclusion/failure, or merely lists elements without achieving the purpose, or abstractly/vaguely describes weaknesses without precisely locating the problem (e.g., only states which is better without explaining why, or states something is illogical without specifying where) Slightly Touched: 0.25 Only mentions partial elements; not implemented or no result; cannot prove purpose achievement Partially Achieved: 0.5 Takes measures or analysis related to the goal, but misses multiple key steps or fails to form verifiable results/conclusions Mostly Achieved: 0.75 Main goal is basically achieved, key conclusions are consistent, but lacks secondary conditions, boundaries, or minor supporting details Fully Achieved: 1.0 The detailed process clearly shows this evaluations intended purpose is achieved; includes necessary execution steps, evidence and results; all key conditions and constraints are satisfied Output Format (fixed, ensure scores are extractable, Rx@Sy means reference list item Rx best matches original list item Sy): (Provide reasoning) <RESULT_START> Scores for each claim: R1@Sx: decimal between 0 and 1, at least two decimal places, e.g., 0.75 R2@Sx: decimal between 0 and 1, at least two decimal places, e.g., 0.75 R3@S0: 0 (indicates no matching content) ... list all items <RESULT_END> Notes: Only evaluate based on reason points in the brief summary; do not count new content from detailed processes toward achievement. For quantitative claims, verify values, ranges, thresholds and conditions; if key constraints are not satisfied, do not judge as fully achieved. Figure 9: MetaJudge semantic-matching prompt. Given an original (model-generated) list of atomic reasons and reference (human) list, the LLM performs strict one-to-one matching and assigns fulfillment score in [0, 1] for each reference reason. C.3 More Results As show in Figure 10, the scatter plots illustrate the relationship between outcome correctness and reasoning quality. While most models exhibit positive correlation, o3-mini appears as significant outlier (bottom-center in all plots), maintaining competitive outcome accuracy but suffering from collapsed rationale consistency. This effectively visualizes the Deceptive Alignment trap. Furthermore, at the frontier (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro), outcome accuracy saturates, whereas rationale accuracy remains highly discriminative. 18 Figure 10: Outcome Accuracy vs. Rationale Consistency across four domains. 19 Case Study 1: Popular Science Article Evaluation Writing Task: Please write popular science article titled Humans Observe Novel Colors for the First Time Through Precise Cone Cell Stimulation. The article should adopt rigorous scientific reporting structure, introducing the breakthrough discoveries in visual perception mechanisms brought by the upgraded laser system of the Oz research equipment. The language should be accessible yet scientifically rigorous, helping readers understand how the laser system can stimulate individual cone cells. Finally, emphasize the revolutionary medical prospects for color vision deficiency correction. Response A: Humans Observe New Colors for the First Time by Deceiving the Eyes new device allowed 5 subjects to see an intense blue-green color that humans have never seen before. In the future, this device may help color-blind patients achieve normal vision. The related paper was recently published in Science Advances. Humans perceive color through the retina. The retina typically contains three types of photoreceptive cone cellsS, M, and typeswhich absorb light in the blue, green, and red spectral ranges respectively, then send signals to the brain. Ren Ng at UC Berkeley wondered: what color would people perceive if only one type of cone cell were activated? His inspiration came from research device called Oz... Response B: groundbreaking study published in the latest issue of Nature Neuroscience reports that research team led by Professor Oz from the Donahue-McLaren Vision Research Institute successfully achieved precise targeted stimulation of individual human retinal cone cells using an upgraded adaptive optics laser system. In the experiments, subjects reported observing entirely new color perceptions that do not exist in nature... Original Evaluator Feedback (3 evaluators): Comparison: Response is significantly superior in factual accuracy. Response contains serious errors, including mistaking the device name Oz for professors name and incorrectly citing the publication. On Response A: Complete and logically clear structure; strong scientific rigor noting that stimulating single cone cell cannot produce sufficient neural signals; includes control groups and uses direct quotations to enhance authority. On Response B: Fluent writing style, but contains serious factual errorsmistaking Oz for professor, incorrectly citing Nature Neuroscience (actually Science Advances), and fabricating non-existent institutions. Merged Evaluation (after LLM refinement): 1. Response is significantly superior in factual accuracy. Response contains serious errors: mistaking device name Oz for professor, citing wrong journal (Nature Neuroscience vs. actual Science Advances), and fabricating research institutions. 2. Response has complete, logically clear structure progressing through: key findings color perception principles experimental setup results medical implications. 3. Response demonstrates scientific rigor: notes neural signal limitations of single-cell stimulation, includes control groups, uses appropriate direct quotations. Removed Statements (selected examples): Response has higher overall quality (Reason: generic evaluation without specifics) Language is smooth and fluent (Reason: too general, lacks direction) Figure 11: Popular science article evaluation demonstrating the annotation and refinement process. Response Bs factual errors (misidentifying the device Oz as professor name, citing wrong journal) are identified by evaluators. The LLM refinement consolidates redundant points while filtering overly general statements. 20 Case Study 2: Film Review Evaluation (Identity, 2003) Writing Task: Please write an in-depth film review titled When Human Nature Becomes Battlefield about the movie Identity. Analyze how Identity explores the complexity of good and evil coexisting in human nature through its multiple personality disorder narrative structure, childhood trauma metaphors, and confined space setting. Combining the films audio-visual language and social critique perspective, analyze why this film is considered milestone in psychological thriller cinema. Response A: When Human Nature Becomes Battlefield: The Psychological Maze and Suspense Aesthetics of Identity As milestone in thriller cinema, Identity has become an unsurpassable classic with its thrilling narrative structure, complex personality disorder themes, and subversive plot twist ending. The film uses torrential rainstorm as backdrop, trapping eleven strangers in wilderness motel, constructing an isolated snowstorm manor style confined space. The rainstorm symbolizes the washing of patient consciousness by drug treatment, while the motel is the materialized battlefield within DID patients mind... Response B: The movie Identity is not merely locked-room murder mystery; it is meticulously constructed psychological maze whose true battlefield lies within shattered soul. Director James Mangold cleverly transforms Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) into materialized killing game, exploring the complex nature of good and evil coexisting in human nature through multiple personality narrative structure and childhood trauma metaphors... Original Evaluator Feedback (3 evaluators): Comparison: Response presents overview followed by multi-dimensional analysis with clear logic. Response has logical deviations in battlefield location argument with unclear expression. On Response A: Accurate professional language (psychological metaphor, dual-line narrative, snowstorm manor); sharp style matching films tone; in-depth analysis covering trauma, good-evil struggle, social critique. However, text appears non-original; social critique section somewhat abruptly placed. On Response B: Fairly accurate opening summary; contains expression errors such as misreading killings as PTSD manifestation (actually materialization of treatment); unclear phrasing; superficial audio-visual analysis lacking specific shot examples. Merged Evaluation (after LLM refinement): 1. Response performs better with clear structure (overview multi-dimensional analysis), accurate professional terminology, and sharp writing style matching films tone. Content analysis covers childhood trauma, good-evil struggle, and social critique effectively. 2. Response has originality concerns (text appears non-original) and structural issues (social critique section abruptly placed; analysis of personality-plot connections lacks depth). 3. Response contains accuracy and expression deficiencies: misreads killings as PTSD manifestation (actually treatment materialization); battlefield location logic is flawed; unclear expression; superficial audio-visual analysis without specific shot support. Removed Statements (selected examples): Response is clearly better overall (Reason: generic comparative judgment) The writing flows naturally (Reason: vague without specific examples) Figure 12: Film review evaluation for Identity (2003). Evaluators identify Response As professional terminology and structural clarity while noting originality concerns. Response Bs misinterpretation of plot elements (confusing treatment metaphors with PTSD) and superficial analysis are documented. The refinement process consolidates feedback into actionable evaluation points. 21 User Prompt: [Creative Writing] Team 7 + Hinata got into the world freedom planet. Response Response Team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno, along with Hinata Hyuga, found themselves transported to the world freedom planet...

The OC model produces completely incorrect analysis (claims wrong flag is correct), achieving 0% Rationale Consistency. Step 0 identifies only 1 issue (25% RC). Rationale+Outcome surpasses the baseline by correctly identifying that both responses have flag issues (75% RC). 26 Creative Writing Pairwise Evaluation Annotation Guidelines Given the same creative-writing requirement and two candidate texts (A and B), you must perform rigorous comparative evaluation focused on writing quality and completeness (not factuality). Your job is to output: whether the prompt is standard query, an overall quality judgment (A<B / A=B / A>B), verifiable short rationale, evidence-based strengths and weaknesses for both and B, and set of mutually exclusive atomic labels for structured aggregation. [Evidence Requirement] In Overall Rationale and each bullet under strengths/weaknesses, provide locatable evidence whenever possible: Quote short snippet or paraphrase specific part (no long quoting required). Point to the corresponding plot beat / setting rule / character action / wording that supports your claim. Do not give purely generic statements such as is better or illogical without specifying where/why. [Overall Decision Rule] A<B: is clearly better on one or more key dimensions and this advantage materially improves overall quality. A=B: overall quality is comparable; or pros/cons offset such that winner is not justifiable. A>B: is clearly better on one or more key dimensions and this advantage materially improves overall quality. Even if both are weak, still pick the one closer to an acceptable finished piece; use A=B only if they are genuinely indistinguishable and explain why. [Output Format] (fixed order; keep headings; ensure the atomic labels are mutually exclusive) 1. Standard query: Yes / No 2. Quality judgment: A<B / A=B / A>B 3. Overall rationale (15 sentences): summarize the decisive factors with evidence references. 4. What does well: at least 2 bullet points (each with evidence). 5. What does poorly: at least 2 bullet points (each with evidence). 6. What does well: at least 2 bullet points (each with evidence). 7. What does poorly: at least 2 bullet points (each with evidence). 8. Atomic evaluation (mutually exclusive labels): output the required label fields from your label table (Section 6), selecting exactly one option per field.
