            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Since the introduction of Sora (OpenAI, 2024) by OpenAI, video generation technology has attracted substantial attention from both industry and academia, leading to rapid advancements in the field. The emergence of models capable of generating videos that are on par with professionally crafted content has significantly improved the efficiency of content creation while simultaneously reducing the costs associated with video production. These rapid advancements in video generation technology have also been greatly attributed to the development of the open-source community. Notable projects like HunyuanVideo (Kong et al., 2024), Mochi (GenmoTeam, 2024), and CogVideoX (Yang et al., 2025b) have made their video foundation model codes and weights publicly available, gradually narrowing the gap between open-source models and commercial counterparts. However, it is essential to acknowledge the persistent gap between these outstanding open-source models and the latest closed-source models. This gap is primarily evident in three aspects: Suboptimal Performance: notable performance gap remains, as the pace of development in commercial models far exceeds that of current open-source models, resulting in significantly superior capabilities. Limited Capabilities: Most foundational models are limited to general text-to-video (T2V) tasks, whereas the demands of video creation are multifaceted. Consequently, basic T2V models are insufficient to address these diverse requirements. Insufficient Efficiency: Despite their impressive performance and scale, these models often prove impractical for creative teams with limited computational resources, hindering their accessibility and usability. These challenges collectively impose constraints on the continued growth and innovation within the open-source community. To address the aforementioned challenges, this report introduces and publicly releases novel series of high-performance foundational video generation models, referred to as Wan, which sets new benchmark in the field. The core design of Wan is inspired by the success of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) (Peebles & Xie, 2023) combined with Flow Matching (Lipman et al., 2022), framework that has demonstrated the significant performance gains achievable through scaling in both textto-image (T2I) (Esser et al., 2024) and text-to-video (T2V) (Kong et al., 2024) tasks. Within this architectural paradigm, cross-attention is employed to embed text conditions, while the models design is meticulously optimized to ensure computational efficiency and precise text controllability. To further enhance the models ability to capture complex dynamics, full spatio-temporal attention mechanism is incorporated. Through extensive experimentation, the model is validated at scale, reaching 14 billion parameters. Subsequently, Wan has seen large-scale data comprising billions of images and videos, amounting to O(1) trillions of tokens in total. This extensive training facilitates the emergence of the models capabilities, allowing it to demonstrate robust performance across multiple dimensions, such as motion amplitude and quality, visual text generation, camera control, instruction adherence, and stylistic diversity. Building upon the powerful foundational model, we have expanded its capabilities to numerous downstream tasks, including image-to-video generation (I2V), instruction-guided video editing (V2V), zero-shot personalized customization, real-time video generation, and audio generation, among other critical applications. To minimize inference costs, we also introduce 1.3B model alongside 14B model for T2V and I2V, both of which support 480p resolution and greatly enhance inference efficiency. Remarkably, the 1.3B model requires only 8.19G of VRAM, allowing it to run on many consumer-grade GPUs, while its performance exceeds that of many larger open-source models. Moreover, we will also publicly present the entire training process, including the large-scale data construction pipeline, video variational autoencoder (VAE), training strategies, acceleration techniques, and automated evaluation algorithms, to empower the community in developing specialized foundational video models. In addition, we will provide comprehensive design details and experimental results, offering insights into phenomena observed during the resource-intensive training of large generative models alongside our key findings and conclusions. We are confident that these contributions will play pivotal role in accelerating the advancement of video generation technology."

            "content": "Driven by advances in generative modeling, the landscape of large-scale video models has evolved significantly, particularly in diffusion-based frameworks. Our review focuses on two broad categories: closed-source models and contributions from the open-source community. 3 Figure 2: Samples generated by Wan. Wan can produce videos with large motions, high fidelity, and realistic details. It is also the first model to generate both Chinese and English text within videos. Additionally, Wan offers range of features, including text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing capabilities. Closed-source models. Closed-source models are mainly those developed by major technology companies, which aims at high-quality, professional video generation due to the extensive resources invested. We organize the notable models released over the past year in chronological order. In February 2024, OpenAI introduced Sora (OpenAI, 2024) and marked significant leap in AIgenerated content. In June 2024, Kling (Kuaishou, 2024.06) by Kuaishou and Luma 1.0 (LumaLabs, 2024.06) by LUMA AI were opened up for public testing, offering powerful video generation capabilities. Meanwhile, Runway unveiled Gen-3 (Runway, 2024.06), building upon Gen-2 (Runway, 2023), to further elevate the standards in video creation. In July 2024, Shengshu AI released Vidu (Bao et al., 2024) equipped with self-designed U-ViT (Bao et al., 2023) architecture. In September 2024, both Kling and Luma undergone updates to version 1.5. During the same period, MiniMax introduced 4 Hailuo Video (MiniMax, 2024.09), delivering impressive visual results to the public. In October 2024, Pika Labs launched Pika 1.5 (PikaLabs, 2024.10), enabling users to customize visual and physical attributes in videos. In addition, Meta introduced Movie Gen (Polyak et al.), series of video foundation models that detailed their training processes and applications. In December 2024, Kling advanced to version 1.6 and, concurrently, Google released Veo 2 (DeepMind, 2024.12) with an improved understanding of real-world physics and human movement nuances. These developments underscore the intense global competition in the video generation sector. In this context, our open-source Wan has shown competitive or even superior performance over these commercial models across both internal and external benchmarks, leading in multiple attributes. Contributions from open-source community. On the other hand, the open-source community has made substantial contributions not only to the holistic video generative models but also to the exploration of essential model components. Diffusion-based video generation models typically build on Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) architecture. It mainly involves three critical modules: an autoencoder to map the original video into compact latent space, text encoder to extract text embeddings, and neural network optimized via the diffusion model to learn the distribution of these video latents. For network structure, U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), initially used in image generation (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020), is adapted for video generation by incorporating temporal dimensions. VDM (Ho et al., 2022) extends the 2D U-Net to 3D version, while another paradigm (Zhou et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2024b) introduces 1D temporal attention combined with 2D spatial attention block to reduce computation costs. Notably, Diffusion Transformers (DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023)), which rely solely on transformer blocks, are superior to U-Net in visual generation tasks (Chen et al., 2023a). This structure has also been transferred to video models (Ma et al., 2024), giving rise to two common variants: the original DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023; HaCohen et al., 2024) that uses cross-attention for text embeddings and MM-DiT (GenmoTeam, 2024; Kong et al., 2024), where text embeddings are concatenated to visual embeddings for full-attention processing. Regarding autoencoders, while the early approach (Rombach et al., 2022) adopts standard VAE (Kingma, 2013), recent autoencoders like VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017) and VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021) improve model design for better reconstruction and compression. LTX-Video (HaCohen et al., 2024) modifies the VAE decoder to perform the final denoising step and convert latents into pixels, where the missing high-frequency details are generated during decoding. The text encoder is also critical for text-based video generation. Current powerful video generation models primarily utilize the T5 series (Raffel et al., 2020) as the main text encoder, often in conjunction with CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). In the case of HunyuanVideo (Kong et al., 2024), T5 is replaced with Multimodal Large Language Model (Liu et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023) to achieve more robust alignment between text embeddings and visual features. By integrating these key modules with effective diffusion-based optimization techniques (Ho et al., 2020; Song & Ermon, 2019; Lipman et al., 2022), multiple promising open-source video generation models have emerged (GenmoTeam, 2024; Kong et al., 2024; HaCohen et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025b). In Wan, we have carefully designed or selected each critical component to ensure high-quality video synthesis. We provide detailed design information and ablation study, which can facilitate the design of future video generation models. In addition, numerous studies have explored downstream tasks in video generation. These tasks include repainting (AI, 2022; Zhou et al., 2023), editing (Meng et al., 2021; Brooks et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023b; Wei et al., 2024b), controllable generation (Zhang et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c), and frame reference generation (Yang et al., 2025b; Guo et al., 2024a), often by leveraging adapter-based and ControlNet-like architectures (Zhang et al., 2023b; Chu et al., 2023) to incorporate user-specified conditions. We also develop various downstream applications based on Wan, which have demonstrated excellent performance."

            "title": "3.1 PRE-TRAINING DATA",
            "content": "We curated and deduplicated candidate dataset sourced from both internal copyrighted sources and publicly accessible data. In the pre-training stage, our goal is to select high-quality and diverse data from this expansive yet noisy dataset to facilitate effective training. Throughout the data mining process, we designed four-step data cleaning process, focusing on fundamental dimensions, visual quality, and motion quality. Subsequently, we will also highlight our data processing workflow for constructing visual text data. Fundamental dimensions. The fundamental dimensions of our data filtering framework focus on the intrinsic attributes of the source video and image data, enabling efficient preliminary filtering out of all the unsuitable data. Specifically, our multidimensional filtering approach encompasses the following critical aspects: Text detection. lightweight OCR detector is implemented to quantify text coverage ratios, effectively excluding videos and images with excessive textual elements to maintain visual clarity. Aesthetic evaluation: We use the widely adopted LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al., 2021) aesthetic classifier to perform an initial quality assessment of our images, quickly filtering out lowquality data. NSFW Score. Through our internal safety assessment model, we systematically evaluate and filter inappropriate content based on computed NSFW scores in all training data. Watermark and logo detection. We detect whether the video or images contain watermarks and logos, and crop these elements during training. Black border detection. Utilizing heuristic-based detection methods, we automatically crop extraneous black borders to maintain focus on content-rich regions. Overexposure detection. Our trained expert classifier evaluates and filters out data with abnormal tonal distributions, ensuring optimal visual quality in the training dataset. Synthetic image detection. Empirical evidence indicates that even minimal contamination (< 10%) by generated images can significantly degrade the performance of the model. Therefore, we train an expert classifier to filter out these contaminating images. Blur detection. An internally developed model assigns quantitative blur scores to training materials, enabling the systematic removal of visually indistinct content. Duration and resolution. We also enforce constraints where video duration must exceed 4 seconds, and resolution thresholds are applied at different training stages to filter out low-quality data. Through the implementation of these efficient preprocessing strategies, we successfully eliminated approximately 50% of the initial dataset. The retained high-quality data subsequently progresses to more superior semantic-driven selection stage for further refinement. Visual quality. This primarily involves selecting data from the candidate dataset that is of relatively high quality and meets pre-training standards. This subset of data must have good visual quality and its overall distribution should align with that of natural data. In this process, we divide the task into two parts: clustering and scoring. Clustering is used to split all the data into smaller subsets, allowing us to process each subset individually. The benefit of this approach is that it prevents the loss of small yet important data segments that might occur due to long-tail distribution, thereby maintaining the original data distribution. Specifically, we divide the data into 100 clusters and then select certain amount of data from each cluster for the next stage of data processing. Scoring is used to assign quality score to each video or image, facilitating the selection and processing of data at different stages. Specifically, we select samples from each cluster for manual scoring (ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best). We then train an expert assessment model using all the annotated data to score the entire dataset. Motion quality. The goal of motion quality assessment is to select videos that are natural, complete, and with significant motion, while avoiding static or jittery movements. We classify video data into six distinct motion quality tiers. Optimal motion: This level represents videos with optimal attributes, such as significant motion layout, perspective, and amplitude, along with clean, smooth movement. Medium-quality motion: Videos in this category exhibit noticeable movements but may have minor issues like multiple subjects or partial occlusion. This data ensures motion diversity and can be used during pre-training to help the model better understand spatio-temporal relationships. Static Videos: This category primarily focuses on the videos, which consist largely of chat and interview-style videos. While these videos contain minimal motion information, they are of high quality. Therefore, we need to identify them separately and reduce their sampling ratio. Camera-driven Motion: Footage dominated by camera movement (e.g., aerial shots) with minimal subject motion. Given their similarity to static images, these receive substantially lower sampling priority. Low-quality Motion: Videos exhibiting excessive subjects, severe occlusions, or unclear main subjects (e.g., crowded street scenes). Such content is excluded due to its negative impact on training efficiency and motion 6 Figure 3: Data provisioning across different training phases. For each stage, we dynamically adjust the proportions of data related to motion, quality, and category based on data throughput. generation quality. Shaky camera footage: Amateur recordings with pronounced camera shake, often causing motion blur and ambiguous foreground-background differentiation. This category is systematically excluded from training consideration. Visual text data. In addition, we also introduce novel data processing approach to enhance the visual text generation of Wan. This approach comprises two distinct processing branches designed to improve both the accuracy and the harmony of text rendering. On one hand, we synthesize hundreds of millions of text-containing images by rendering Chinese characters on pure white background. On the other hand, we collect large amounts of text-containing images from vast real-world data. We employ multiple OCR models to accurately recognize both English and Chinese text from images and videos, and subsequently input these extracted text contents into the multimodal language model Qwen2-VL. This process generates natural descriptions of the images, ensuring that the descriptions incorporate as much precise text content as possible. We collect mass of real-world image-text pairs by leveraging this processing pipeline. By integrating both synthetic and real data during the pre-training stage, our approach effectively generalizes to generate rare words in videos with accurate glyphs and high realism, demonstrating significant superiority in visual text generation."

Our data processing pipeline in this stage employs distinct strategies for static and dynamic data: image data undergoes optimization for improved visual quality, while video data is specifically processed to refine motion quality. Image processing. From the pool of high-scoring image data, we perform an additional refinement process to identify top-quality samples that the images excel in aspects such as quality, composition and details. Specifically, we construct the curated dataset using two methods: expert-based collection and manual collection. The former method involves selecting the top 20% of images based on scores predicted by an expert model. For this subset, we also consider factors such as style and category to ensure diversity in data distribution. The latter approach involves manually collecting top-quality images from various categories and data sources while also filling in any missing concepts in our dataset to enhance the models generalization capabilities. Through this process, we collected total of millions of curated images. 7 Video processing. In this phase, we employ strategy similar to the one used for images to collect top-quality videos. First, we filter out some top-ranked videos from the candidate datasets using the visual quality classifier. Then, based on the motion quality classifier, we select millions of videos featuring simple movements and millions of videos with complex movements. All video selections follow strategy that emphasizes category balance and high diversity. Meanwhile, we select data from 12 major categories, including technology, animals, arts, humans, vehicles, and etc, in order to enhance the models generative capabilities for commonly used categories."

Therefore, we also collected pure text instruction data to enhance our models ability to follow instructions. 3.3.2 IN-HOUSE DATASET We collect an in-house dataset for various tasks to enhance the models capabilities in specific areas. Celebrities, landmarks, and movie characters. To train our model to recognize celebrities, landmarks, and characters, we collect dataset comprising thousands of identities. First, we use large language models (LLMs) to collect names, then retrieve corresponding images from our image-text database using CLIP-style model. We test various CLIP-style models and find that TEAM (Xie et al., 2022) excels in recognizing individuals, particularly Chinese celebrities. To further reduce noise in our dataset, we implemented keyword matching for the descriptions of the image-text pairs. An image is retained only if it is retrieved by the TEAM model and matches the specified keywords. Object counting. To enhance our models visual counting ability, we compiled counting dataset by retrieving images with text descriptions that include words like one, two, three, etc. These numbers provide coarse annotations for the images. We then use LLM to extract (category, count) pairs from the corresponding text. Finally, we use Grounding DINO (Liu et al., 2023d) to count objects in those categories. An image is retained only if its text description matches the results from Grounding DINO (Liu et al., 2023d). OCR. To improve our models capability in generating text descriptions, we collect an OCRaugmented image caption dataset. Initially, we used an off-the-shelf OCR detector to extract text from images. Then, we prompt our caption model to generate descriptions based on these OCR results. This approach ensures accurate text descriptions by using the extracted OCR text as prior knowledge. Currently, we include only English and Chinese texts. Camera angle and motion. We observe that current multi-modal language models (MLLMs) struggle with predicting camera angles and motion, including state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o and Google Gemini Pro. To enhance these predictions, we first annotate set of videos for camera angle and motion. This dataset can be utilized in two ways: directly training our caption model used in the final training stage, or by training an expert model to annotate more video data, aiding our model during the early training phase. This dataset enhances the accuracy of our motion and angle descriptions, thereby improving the camera motion controllability of our video generation model. 8 Fine-grained categories. To enhance our models ability to recognize fine-grained categories such as animals, plants, and vehicles, we created dataset containing several million images across these categories. Relational understanding. We enhance our models relational understanding by gathering dataset that focus on spatial relationships, such as left, right, up, and down, through the incorporation of existing object detection datasets. Re-caption. An important capability of caption model is to leverage existing tags or brief captions to generate dense captions. To facilitate this, we curate re-caption dataset that extends brief text tags or captions to detailed descriptions based on image content. Editing instruction caption. We collect dataset that describes the differences or transformations between two images. This type of caption is valuable for image editing tasks. Group image description. We collect dataset that provides descriptions for groups of images. Each caption begins with description of the common features shared by the images, followed by individual descriptions of each image, using similar phrasing. Human-annotated image and video captions. We gather human-annotated dense caption for both images and videos. These represent our highest-quality caption data and are used in the final stage of model training.

An image can be divided into maximum of seven patches. For each patch, we adaptively pool the vision embeddings to 1212 grid representation to reduce computation. For the video, we sample 3 frames per second, with an upper limit of 129 frames. To further reduce computation, we employ slow-fast encoding strategy: maintaining the original resolution for every fourth frame and applying global average pooling to the embeddings of the remaining frames. Experiments on long video benchmarks indicate that the slow-fast mechanism enhances understanding with limited number of visual tokens (e.g., improving performance from 67.6% to 69.1% on VideoMME (Fu et al., 2024)) without subtitles.

The orange rectangles represent 2 spatio-temporal compression, and the green rectangles represent 2 spatial compression. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Wu et al., 2024; Blattmann et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024) play crucial role in learning compact latent representations from high-dimensional visual data (especially videos), facilitating scalable and efficient training of generative models, e.g., diffusion models. However, designing effective VAEs for video generation tasks faces several challenges. First, videos inherently possess both spatial and temporal dimensions, requiring the VAE to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Second, the inherent high-dimensional nature of video (e.g., multiple frames with high-resolution pixels) increases memory consumption and computational costs, making it difficult to scale VAEs to long video sequences. Third, ensuring temporal causality (i.e., future frames do not influence past frames) is critical for generating realistic and coherent video content, yet this constraint introduces additional architectural complexities. To address these challenges, we propose novel 3D causal VAE architecture (Wan-VAE) specifically designed for video generation. We combine multiple strategies (Wu et al., 2024) to improve spatiotemporal compression, reduce memory usage, and ensure temporal causality. These enhancements make Wan-VAE more efficient and scalable and better suited for integration with diffusion-based generative models such as DiT.

This modification enables the use of the feature cache mechanism (refer to Sec. 4.1.3), significantly improving the inference efficiency. Furthermore, we halve the input feature channel in the spatial upsampling layer, resulting in 33% reduction in memory consumption during inference. By carefully tuning the number of base channels further, Wan-VAE achieves compact model size of only 127M parameters.

Specifically, the number of video sequence frames follows the 1 + input format, so we divide the video into 1 + /4 chunks, which is consistent with the number of latent features. When processing input video sequences, the model employs chunk-wise strategy where each encoding and decoding operation handles only the video chunk corresponding to single latent representation. Based on the temporal compression ratio, the number of frames in each processing chunk is limited to at most 4, effectively preventing memory overflow. To ensure temporal continuity between context chunks, our model strategically maintains frame-level feature caches from preceding chunks. These cached features are systematically integrated into the causal convolution computations of subsequent chunks. The specific process is illustrated in Fig. 6, which demonstrates two typical scenarios in our feature cache mechanism. In Fig. 6 (a), in our default setting, the causal convolution does not change the number of frames, and we need to maintain two cached features (convolution kernel size is 3) from historical frames. For the initial chunk, we apply zero padding with two dummy frames to initialize the cache buffer. Subsequent chunks systematically reuse the last two frames from the preceding chunk as cached features while discarding obsolete historical data. Fig. 6 (b) presents the scenario involving 2 temporal downsampling (stride is equal to 2). Here, the scenario necessitates different cache management: we implement single-frame cache 11 Figure 7: Comparison of video reconstruction performance at 720 720 resolution and 25 frames. padding exclusively for non-initial chunks to ensure dimensional consistency. This configuration guarantees that the output sequence length follows the exact downsampling ratio while maintaining causal relationships across the boundaries of the chunk. This feature cache mechanism not only optimizes memory utilization but also preserves feature coherence across chunk boundaries, thereby supporting stable inference for infinite-length videos."

For the DiT model, the main computational cost is given by the expression L(αbsh2 + βbs2h), where denotes the number of DiT layers, is the micro batch size, indicates the sequence length, and denotes the hidden dimension size. Here, α corresponds to the cost of the linear layers and β to that of the attention layer, for the non-causal attention used in Wan, β is 4 for the forward pass and 8 for the backward pass. Unlike general LLM models, the sequence length processed by Wan often reaches hundreds of thousands or more. Since the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, while the cost associated with the linear layers increases only linearly, the attention mechanism gradually becomes the training bottleneck. In scenarios where the sequence length reaches 1 million, the computation time for attention can account for up to 95% of the end-to-end training time. During the training process, only the DiT model is optimized while the text encoder and the VAE encoder remain frozen. Therefore, GPU memory usage is concentrated on training the DiT. The GPU memory usage for the DiT can be expressed as γLbsh, where γ depends on the implementation of the DiT layers, denotes the number of DiT layers. Because video tokens, input prompts, and timesteps are taken as model input, the value of γ is generally larger than in ordinary LLM models. For example, while standard LLMs might have γ of 34 (Korthikanti et al.), the DiT models γ can exceed 60. Consequently, when the sequence length reaches 1 million tokens and the micro-batch size is 1, the total GPU memory usage for activations in 14B DiT model can exceed 8 TB. 15 Figure 11: Illustration of DiT parallelism. Assuming total of 128 GPUs, the innermost layer consists of combination of Ulysses=8 and Ring=2. The outer layer employs FSDP=32, while the outermost layer utilizes DP=4. The global batch size is 8 times that of the micro-batch size. In summary, the primary computational cost in Wan arises from the attention mechanism.

Sharding along the dimension primarily involves Megatrons tensor parallelism (TP) (Shoeybi et al., 2019) combined with sequence parallelism (SP) (Korthikanti et al.), which shards the hidden dimension of the activations by splitting the weights. Since the communication overhead of CP is smaller than that of (TP + SP), we propose using CP to accelerate the batch-level computations while reducing the activation memory footprint on each GPU. We have designed two-dimensional (2D) CP that combines the characteristics of Ulysses and Ring Attention, similar to USP (Fang & Zhao, 2024). In this design, the outer layer employs Ring Attention, and the inner layer leverages Ulysses. This combination mitigates the slow cross-machine communication inherent in Ulysses and addresses the need for large block sizes after sharding in Ring Attention, thereby maximizing the overlap between outer-layer communication and inner-layer computation. In scenarios with sequence length of 256K and 16 GPUs across 2 machines, the communication overhead of 2D Context Parallelism is reduced from over 10% with Ulysses to below 1%. The FSDP group and CP group intersect within the FSDP group, the DP size equals the FSDP size divided by the CP size. After satisfying memory and single-batch latency requirements, we use DP for the scaling. Fig. 11 illustrates the distributed scheme for the DiT module. For example, in configuration with 128 GPUs, the CP size is 16, with Ulysses set to 8 and Ring Attention to 2; FSDP is set to 32, corresponding to batch size of 2b; DP is set to 4, resulting in global batch size of 8b. Distributed strategy switching for different modules. During training, different modules utilize the same resources. Specifically, we apply DP to the VAE and Text Encoder, while the DiT module employs combination of DP and CP. Therefore, when the outputs of the VAE and Text Encoder are fed into the DiT module during training, it is necessary to switch distributed strategies to avoid resource wastage. Specifically, CP requires that devices within the CP group read the same batch of data. Yet, if devices in the VAE and Text Encoder sections also read the same data, this leads to redundant computations. To eliminate this redundancy, devices within the CP group initially read different data. Then, before CP, we perform loop traversal of size equal to the CP size, sequentially broadcasting the data read by different devices within the CP group to ensure that the inputs within CP are identical. In this way, the time proportion of VAE and Text Encoder within single model iteration is reduced to 1/CP , thereby enhancing overall performance."

            "content": "As introduced, the computational cost in Wan grows quadratically with sequence length s, whereas GPU memory usage scales linearly with s. This means that in long sequence scenarios, computation time can eventually exceed the PCIe transfer time required for offloading activations. Specifically, the PCIe transfer time for offloading the activation of one DiT layer can be overlapped with the computation of just 1 to 3 DiT layers. Compared to gradient checkpointing (GC) strategies (Chen et al., 2016), activation offloading (Rhu et al., 2016) that allows computation overlap provides an effective way to reduce GPU memory usage without sacrificing end-to-end performance. Therefore, we prioritize activation offloading to reduce GPU memory. Since CPU memory is also prone to exhaustion in long sequence scenarios, we combine offloading with GC strategies, prioritizing gradient checkpointing for layers with high GPU memory-to-computation ratios."

CFG cache: For the unconditional part, we perform DiT forward pass every few steps and reuse the conditional results for the other steps.

As of this reports publication, subsequent optimizations to SageAttention have demonstrated improved Hopper compatibility. Future work will explore the integration of these performance enhancements. We present our optimizations applied to FA3-FP8 implementation, focusing on both numerical stability and computational efficiency. Accuracy.

            "content": "Prompt alignment is designed to boost the effectiveness of model inference by aligning the users input prompt with the format and style of captions used during training. We employ two primary strategies in this process. First, we augment each video with variety of captions, thereby increasing diversity. Second, we rewrite user prompts to align them with the distribution of video captions from the training stage. In the following, we detail these strategies. To accommodate diverse user inputs, each image or video is paired with multiple captions reflecting various styles and lengths. For example, we use captions of differing lengths (e.g., long, medium, and short) and styles (e.g., formal, informal, and poetic) to create varied set of sample-caption pairs for our training data. These captions establish different mapping relations between text and video, effectively covering the range of prompts that users might provide. 19 Figure 13: The dimensions covered in WanBench. Figure 14: Distribution of the number of prompts across various dimensions of WanBench. Despite the diversity of captions, distribution mismatch often exists between the dataset captions and user input prompts. Typically, users prefer concise prompts consisting of few simple words, which are significantly shorter than the training captions. This discrepancy can adversely affect the quality of the generated videos. To address this issue, we rewrite prompts by utilizing large language model (LLM) to refine user prompts. Our primary objective is to align the distribution of these refined prompts with the distribution of the training captions, thereby achieving improved inference performance. The LLM is guided by the following principles when rewriting user prompts: 1. We instruct the LLM to add details to prompts without altering their original meanings, enhancing the completeness and visual appeal of the generated scenes. 2. The rewritten prompts should incorporate natural motion attributes, where we add appropriate actions for the subject based on its category to ensure smoother and more fluent motion in the generated videos. 3. We recommend structuring the rewritten prompts similarly to the post-training captions, beginning with the video style, followed by an abstract of the content, and concluding with detailed description. This method helps align prompts with the distribution of high-quality video captions. We evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-assisted prompt rewriting on our benchmark, and several results are presented in Tab. 1. Our findings suggest that LLMs with strong instruction-following capabilities can generate suitable prompts that enhance video generation.

We propose an automated, comprehensive, and human-aligned Wan-Bench for evaluating video generation models. Wan-Bench is composed of three core dimensions: dynamic quality, image quality, and instruction following with 14 fine-grained metrics. We design specific scoring algorithm for each dimension, using traditional detectors for the simple tasks (e.g. , object detection) and multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for the complex tasks. Dynamic quality. Dynamic quality aims to evaluate the quality and stability of the model in non-static scenarios. Large motion generation. To measure the upper limit of motion generation, prompts are designed to encourage significant motions. We calculate the optical flow of the generated video using RAFT (Teed & Deng, 2021) and assess the motion scores by the magnitude of the normalized optical flow. Human artifacts. Existing evaluation methods lack the ability to detect AI-generated artifacts. Thus, we train YOLOv3-based model Redmon & Farhadi (2018) on 20,000 AI-generated images annotated by humans to identify the locations of artifacts. The artifact scores take into account the predicted likelihood, the bounding boxes, and the corresponding duration. Physical plausibility & smoothness. To evaluate physical plausibility, we design prompts to generate physics-related movements (e.g. , ball bouncing, object interactions, water flow) and employ Qwen2VL (Bai et al., 2023), leveraging its extensive real-world physics knowledge. Through video question-answer model, we detect violations of physical laws, such as object clipping, unrealistic collisions, or gravity-defying movements. To evaluate smoothness, prompts are crafted to include complex motions, with Qwen2-VL identifying artifacts to assess motion fluidity. Pixel-level stability. Pixel-level stability is used to determine if noise frequently appears in the video. We employ optical flow to identify static regions and calculate frame-wise differences within those areas. For stable videos, these differences within static regions are relatively minimal. ID consistency. Three kinds of sub-dimensions are considered: human consistency, animal consistency, and object consistency covering different collections of prompts. Frame-level DINO (Caron et al., 2021) features are extracted to compare the frame-wise similarity as the consistency score. Image quality. The purpose of the image quality dimension is to evaluate the visual quality and aesthetic perception. Comprehensive image quality. Measuring the visual quality requires an evaluation of the fidelity and aesthetics. For fidelity, we employ MANIQA (Yang et al., 2022), which effectively detects blur and artifacts, ensuring precise clarity assessment. For aesthetics, we utilize two established models: the LAION-based aesthetic predictor (LAION-AI, 2022) and MUSIQ (Ke et al., 2021). We compute the final image quality score by averaging these three evaluators. Scene generation quality. We evaluate two key aspects: frame-wise scene consistency and scene-text alignment. For consistency, we measure CLIP similarity (Radford et al., 2021) across consecutive frames to ensure temporal coherence. For alignment, we compute CLIP similarity between frames and their corresponding text to verify semantic accuracy. We compute the quality score by weighted averaging these metrics. Stylization. We employ Qwen2-VL to evaluate the artistic video generation capability through frame-level question answering. Instruction following. Instruction following assesses the models ability to comprehend and execute textual instructions. Single object & multiple objects & spatial positions. We employ Qwen2-VL to predict object categories, counts, and spatial relationships within videos. The evaluation score represents the average number of frames that accurately correspond to the given prompts. Camera control. We evaluate five camera movement styles: panning, lifting, zooming in/out, aerial shots, and tracking shots by 130 tailored prompts. For panning, lifting, and zooming, we analyze optical flow via RAFT to assess movement style. For complex aerial and tracking shots, we employ Qwen2-VL to infer camera movement through video question-answering. Action instruction following. We categorize motions into human (e.g. , crawling), and object movements (e.g. , flying). As evaluating these motions requires prior knowledge of their execution, we employ Qwen2-VL by providing it with keyframes. We query the model for alignment of the action, completion of the action, and presence of artifacts to comprehensively evaluate alignment between text and video. , running), animal (e.g. Human feedback guided weighting strategy. We utilize human feedback to assign comprehensive video quality score, considering that each dimension has different impact on user preferences rather than simply averaging them. We collect over 5,000 pairwise comparisons of videos generated by different models including Wan. Users evaluate pairs based on given text, indicating their preference and assigning approximate scores. The dimension preference weighting is derived from the Pearson correlation between model-generated scores and human-rated scores, serving as weighting factor in the final score calculation. 21 Wan-Bench Dimension CNTopB Hunyuan Mochi CNTopA Sora Wan 1.3B Wan 14B Large Motion Generation Human Artifacts Pixel-level Stability ID Consistency Physical Plausibility Smoothness Comprehensive Image Quality Scene Generation Quality Stylization Ability Single Object Accuracy Multiple Object Accuracy Spatial Position Accuracy Camera Control Action Instruction Following Weighted Score 0.405 0.712 0.977 0.940 0.836 0.765 0.621 0.369 0.623 0.987 0.840 0.518 0.465 0.917 0.690 0.413 0.734 0.983 0.935 0.898 0.890 0.605 0.373 0.386 0.912 0.850 0.464 0.406 0.735 0.673 0.420 0.622 0.981 0.930 0.728 0.530 0.530 0.368 0.403 0.949 0.693 0.512 0.605 0.907 0.639 0.284 0.833 0.974 0.936 0.759 0.880 0.668 0.386 0.346 0.942 0.880 0.434 0.529 0.783 0. 0.482 0.786 0.952 0.925 0.933 0.930 0.665 0.388 0.606 0.932 0.882 0.458 0.380 0.721 0.700 0.468 0.707 0.976 0.938 0.912 0.790 0.596 0.385 0.430 0.930 0.859 0.476 0.483 0.844 0.689 0.415 0.691 0.972 0.946 0.939 0.910 0.640 0.386 0.328 0.952 0.860 0.590 0.527 0.860 0.724 Table 2: Performance comparison of commercial and open-source models using Wan-Bench."

            "content": "We provide ablation studies of key modules within our model design to offer insights into the overall architectures contributions. Experiments are conducted on 1.3B version for rapid evaluation. Ablation on adaptive normalization layers. Given the substantial parameter load of adaptive normalization layers (Perez et al., 2018) (adaLN) in DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023), we explore whether focusing on parameter volume in adaLN or increasing the depth of the network layers is more effective. To adjust the parameter volume, we follow the setup from PixArt (Chen et al., 2023a) to study whether to share adaLN or not. In the non-shared configuration, each blocks scale and shift parameters are predicted by block-specific MLP that takes as input the time embedding. Instead, the shared AdaLN configuration (referred to as AdaLN-single in PixArt) computes single set of global parameters, which involves predicting scale and shift values, in the first block, which are then shared across all blocks. This sharing significantly reduces the number of parameters. We evaluate four configurations: (i) Full-shared-adaLN-1.3B: This is our original model, where adaLN is fully shared across all 30 attention blocks. (ii) Half-shared-adaLN-1.5B: AdaLN is shared in the first 15 attention blocks while not for the remaining blocks. This results in 1.5B model with an increase of 0.2B parameters. (iii) Full-shared-adaLN-1.5B (extended): AdaLN is shared across all attention blocks, but the model depth is increased to 35 layers, keeping the 1.5B parameter count. (iv) Non-shared-AdaLN-1.7B: AdaLN is not shared across any blocks, and the model depth remains at 30 layers, resulting in 1.7B model. We maintain other parameters unchanged and train the models from scratch to perform text-to-image task for 200,000 steps (i.e., the first stage of our text-to-video training), with the global batch size of 1536. For comparison, we measure performance using the L2 loss between generated images and real images in the latent space during the training stage, with smaller training loss indicating better convergence. 24 Figure 16: Training loss curve with different configurations. As presented in Fig. 16, the Full-shared-AdaLN-1.3B model, with fewer parameters, results in slightly higher training loss compared to others. When comparing Half-shared-AdaLN-1.5B and Full-shared-AdaLN-1.5B, which have the same parameter count, Full-shared-AdaLN-1.5B consistently achieves the lowest training loss. This suggests that focusing on model depth rather than the parameters in AdaLN leads to better performance. Additionally, the Non-shared-AdaLN-1.7B model, despite having more parameters, does not outperform the Full-shared-AdaLN-1.5B and further supports this idea. Therefore, we adopt the fully shared AdaLN design to effectively reduce parameter count while preserving performance. Ablation on text encoder. We select three text encoders that can handle bilingual inputs: umT5 (Chung et al., 2023) (5.3B), Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (QwenTeam, 2024), and GLM-49B (TeamGLM et al., 2024). The T5 series has been popular choice in video generation models (GenmoTeam, 2024; Yang et al., 2025b), while the latter two encoders excel in language understanding, especially among all LLM models under 10B parameters. For this ablation, we keep other settings unchanged and train text-to-image task with global size of 1536. Text embeddings are derived from the second-to-last layers of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GLM-4-9B. We measure the training loss as shown in Fig. 17. Compared to other powerful LLM-based encoders, umT5 demonstrates superior text embedding performance. Notably, HunyuanVideo (Kong et al., 2024) highlights that decoder-only LLMs use causal attention whereas umT5 adopts bidirectional attention, making it suitable for diffusion models. Following HunyuanVideos strategy, we incorporate bidirectional token refiner as an adapter layer. We apply this setup to both Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GLM-4-9B, but the training losses and visualizations still show umT5 performing most favorably.

The noise latent zt, condition latent zc, and rearranged mask are concatenated along the channel axis and then passed through the DiT model of Wan. Since the input of the I2V DiT model has more channels than T2V (i.e., 2 + v.s. c), an additional projection layer is employed, which is initialized with zero values. Moreover, we utilize the image encoder of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) to extract feature representations from the condition image, and the extracted features are projected by three-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which plays role as global context. The produced global context is then injected into the DiT model via decoupled cross-attention. In practice, the aforementioned approach as illustrated in Fig. 18 is extensible to other controllable generation tasks, such as first-last frame transformation and video continuation. The proposed masking mechanism explicitly delineates the input conditions and specifies the frames to be generated. To optimize the efficacy of the masking strategy, we incorporate multiple tasks, i.e., image-to-video generation, video continuation, first-last frame transformation, and random frame interpolation, into our unified framework. Specifically, we adopt the following training paradigm for the I2V model. 26 Figure 18: Wan-I2V model framework.

This insight indicates that while the pre-trained model offers foundational framework for framebased video generation, it lacks the requisite contextual and semantic depth to fully capture the temporal consistency of dynamic video sequences, particularly when the number of conditioning frames is highly limited. To address this limitation, during the SFT stage, we incorporated an image encoder to extract image features through decoupled cross-attention (Ye et al., 2023) like (Guo et al., 2024a), providing global contextual information to enhance the models capacities.

The second mode utilizes pluggable Context Adapter structure in Res-Tuning (Jiang et al., 2023) manner, allowing support for controllable and editing tasks without modifying the base models weights but with an increased overall model scale. Leveraging the robust video generation capabilities of Wan, this innovative framework demonstrates significant competitiveness in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

We start from our Wan-T2V foundation model by first obtaining personalized identity information. Existing video personalization approaches usually rely on ID extractors (e.g., ArcFace (Deng et al., 2019)) or versatile visual extractors (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)) to obtain identity information. While they make promising progress, their performance is bottlenecked by the limitations of the feature extractors. For instance, ID extractors mainly focus on features for face recognition but may not capture other critical visual cues such as scars or stickers. Moreover, they are susceptible to low-resolution faces, illumination variations, and partial occlusions (such as glasses, masks, or hair). On the other hand, versatile visual extractors are not specifically tailored to the face domain and tend to focus on coarse-grained semantic information. Therefore, we choose not to rely on any feature extractor to avoid information loss, and our generation process is directly conditioned on the input face image in the latent space of Wan-VAE. There are many ways to inject the personalized identity information into the video generation process. In our experiments, we found that cross-attention operation is suited to interact with dense representations obtained from identity extractors, while self-attention is more appropriate for modeling data in the same latent space. Fig. 26 illustrates the design of our video personalization approach, which follows self-attention paradigm. Specifically, in the latent space, we first extend additional frames prepended to the given video using the segmented face images. These face images are extracted from the paired video using face detection and segmentation, and the facial landmarks 35 Figure 25: Image samples generated from Wan model. Figure 26: The core design of the video personalization approach in the latent space of Wan-VAE. are further aligned to black canvas that has the same size as the video frame. Then, along the channel dimension of this extended video, we concatenate the face images with all-ones masks for the first frames, and blank images with all-zeros masks for the remaining frames. These concatenated signals serve as the conditions. Finally, the diffusion process is performed on this temporally extended video, conditioned on the channel-wise condition signals in an inpainting fashion. Note that no other modifications are applied to our Wan-T2V model. During training, we randomly drop portion of face images in the extended frames, so as to support 0 to reference face(s) video generation. In the inference stage, starting from the pure noise of the extended video, we concatenate the user-provided face images (no more than K) to the extended frames in the channel dimension and set the corresponding masks as all-ones.

            "content": "Traditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) (Peebles & Xie, 2023) models are constrained in their ability to generate videos longer than few seconds, even when employing significant spatial and 2Part of this section is introduced in previously released tech report The Matrix (Feng et al., 2024). 40 Figure 29: Generated video results guided by camera motion. temporal compression through Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma, 2013). This limitation stems primarily from the computational and memory-intensive nature of attention mechanisms over extended temporal sequences. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Streamer, novel approach that leverages sliding temporal window to manage temporal dependencies efficiently, enabling the generation of long or even infinite-length videos in streaming fashion. Figure 30: Generated 15 minutes video with 8 A100 GPUs in real-time 8 FPS. Shift window denoise process models. The key innovation of Streamer lies in its assumption that temporal dependencies are confined within limited time window. By focusing attention computations within this window, Streamer significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining video continuity. Specifically, Streamer processes video tokens in queue, denoising them over multiple 42 Figure 31: Generated videos with single RTX 4090 GPU, int8 and TensorRT quantization in real-time 20 FPS. noise levels within the window. After fixed number of denoising steps, the leftmost token (with the lowest noise level) is dequeued and cached, while new token with Gaussian noise is appended to the rightmost position. This sliding mechanism ensures that the window maintains consistent length while facilitating the generation of continuous video frames. Training and inference. Streamer is fine-tuned from pre-trained DiT model. During training, sequence of 2w video tokens is sampled, where is the size of the sliding window (typically set to = , the number of diffusion solver steps). The first tokens are used solely for warming up the model and do not contribute to the loss computation. The loss is calculated only on the last tokens, ensuring that the model learns to generate coherent video frames within the window. At inference time, the same warmup strategy is employed: the first tokens are discarded, and the generated video begins from the (w + 1)-th token. Ensuring continuity during training and inference. To maintain smooth transitions between consecutive windows, cached tokens are re-introduced into the token queue at noise level of 0. This allows previously generated tokens to participate in the denoising process of subsequent windows, ensuring temporal consistency and continuity in the generated video. Streamer represents significant advancement in video generation by adapting DiT models for streaming applications. Its sliding temporal window approach addresses the limitations of traditional DiT models, enabling the efficient generation of infinite-length videos while maintaining high quality and temporal coherence. This method opens new possibilities for real-time video generation and long-form content creation. We summarize its advantages as follows: Infinite-Length Video Generation: By leveraging sliding window mechanism, Streamer can generate videos of arbitrary length without incurring prohibitive computational costs; Efficient Attention Computation: Limiting attention computations to confined temporal window reduces memory and processing demands; Seamless Continuity: The caching and re-introduction of tokens ensure smooth transitions between windows, preserving video quality over extended durations."

            "title": "5.6.3 CONSISTENCY MODEL DISTILLATION",
            "content": "After successfully extending the DiT model to Streamer for infinite-length video generation, the next critical step is to address the challenge of achieving real-time rendering of the simulated world. While Streamer enables the generation of long or even infinite videos by efficiently managing temporal dependencies within sliding window, the computational demands of the diffusion process still pose bottleneck for real-time applications. To overcome this, we propose novel integration of Streamer with Consistency Models, cutting-edge approach for accelerating diffusion-based generative processes. Specifically, we leverage the Latent Consistency Model (LCM (Luo et al., 2023)) and its video version (VideoLCM (Wang et al., 2023c)), which distill the original diffusion process and class-free guidance into highly efficient four-step consistency model. This distillation process significantly reduces the number of sampling steps required for high-quality generation while maintaining the temporal coherence and streaming capabilities inherent to Streamer. The integration of LCM with Streamer is designed to preserve the denoising window mechanism, ensuring that the sliding temporal window continues to manage dependencies effectively. During training, we optimize this combined framework to balance efficiency and quality. The result is 10 - 20 acceleration in inference speed, enabling the model to achieve rendering rate of 8 - 16 FPS. This dramatic improvement in performance makes the system viable for real-time applications, such as interactive simulations, live video synthesis, and dynamic content generation in virtual environments. By combining the strengths of Streamerits ability to generate infinite-length videos with temporal coherenceand LCMits efficiency in accelerating the diffusion processwe bridge the gap between high-quality video generation and real-time responsiveness. This advancement not only enhances the practicality of diffusion models for streaming applications but also opens up new possibilities for immersive, interactive, and real-time media creation. Quantization for running in customer-level devices. While the generating speed has been accelerated to real-time levels, deploying the model on consumer-level devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory requirements, even for high-end GPUs like the NVIDIA 4090. To address this, we introduce quantization techniques to optimize the model for efficient deployment. Specifically, we employ two distinct quantization strategies: int8 quantization (torchao maintainers & contributors, 2024) for attention layers and linear heads, and TensorRT quantization (NVIDIA, 2023) for the overall model. The int8 quantization approach significantly reduces memory consumption by converting weights and activations to 8-bit integers, while maintaining the overall generation quality. However, this method provides minimal acceleration in generating speed, as it primarily focuses on memory efficiency rather than computational optimization. On the other hand, TensorRT quantization offers more comprehensive solution, enabling substantial acceleration in generation speed. This technique allows the model to achieve real-time performance of 8 FPS even on single 4090 GPU, making it feasible for consumer-level devices. However, TensorRT quantization introduces modest increase in network error, which can be observed even when its built-in error-checking mechanisms are enabled. This error manifests as slight deviations in output quality, such as minor artifacts or inconsistencies in the generated video. In some cases, it may also lead to measurable instability, such as flickering or temporal incoherence. Despite these trade-offs, the combination of int8 and TensorRT quantization provides balanced approach to optimizing the model for real-time, consumer-level deployment, ensuring both efficiency and practicality while maintaining acceptable generation quality. By carefully tuning the quantization parameters and leveraging TensorRTs error-checking features, we mitigate these issues to the greatest extent possible, enabling robust and efficient performance on consumer-grade hardware."

            "content": "The primary objective of audio generation in this work is to produce synchronized soundtracks for video clips, formulated as video-to-audio (V2A) generation framework. The generated soundtracks consist of ambient sound and background music, explicitly excluding speech or vocal elements. In contrast to text-to-audio models (Liu et al., 2023b; 2024c), the ambient sound generated by video-to-audio models must be temporally aligned with the visual content of the video, while the 44 Figure 32: Framework of video-to-audio generation. Our model processes both video chunk and its associated textual description as dual inputs to synthesize high-quality, semantically coherent audio. accompanying music should accurately reflect the emotional tone and contextual setting of the video, as would naturally be expected. Furthermore, to enhance user control over sound design, our framework integrates both video and textual prompts, enabling users to specify on-screen or off-screen sounds and define the style and presence of background music."

            "title": "5.7.1 MODEL DESIGN",
            "content": "Consistent with our video generation framework, our video-to-audio model also utilizes diffusion transformer (DiT) (Peebles & Xie, 2023) based on the flow-matching (Lipman et al., 2022) to model the denoising diffusion process in the audio domain. The detailed pipeline of our V2A model is illustrated in Fig. 32. Audio autoencoder. widely adopted audio compression approach involves transforming raw waveforms into mel-spectrograms, followed by encoding them into a latent features using an image-based variational autoencoder, as demonstrated in (Liu et al., 2023b; 2024c). However, in the context of diffusion transformer backbone, these latent features must be partitioned into patches and reshaped into tensor of size (H a) a. This patching-and-reshaping process can disrupt the temporal alignment with the corresponding video content, posing significant challenge for synchronization. Considering this limitation, we train compression model that operates directly on raw waveforms. Our 1D-VAE generates latent features of size a, where represents the sequence length along the time axis, preserving explicit temporal information essential for accurate synchronization. Video and text encoder. To achieve frame-accurate synchronization between synthesized audio and visual sequences, we establish temporal coherence through multimodal feature fusion. Our architecture first extracts frame-wise visual embeddings using CLIP Radford et al. (2021) model, then performs temporal rate adaptation through feature replication to match the audio features sampling rate, following (Polyak et al.). The synchronized visual and acoustic features undergo dimension transformation via linear projection layers to align with DiTs latent space, followed by element-wise summation for multimodal fusion. For linguistic understanding across languages, we leverage the pre-trained umT5 model (Chung et al., 2023) as our text encoder, capitalizing on its cross-lingual representation capabilities through frozen parameters. Data. The training data for our V2A model is derived from the video generation dataset through rigorous filtering process. We systematically remove videos lacking soundtracks or containing speech/vocal music, resulting in refined subset of O(1) thousand hours. To enhance multimodal representation, we employ comprehensive captioning strategy: dense video descriptions are complemented with audio-specific captions generated by Qwen2-audio (Chu et al., 2024). These audio captions are categorized into ambient sounds and musical compositions, with the latter characterized by style, rhythm, melody, and instrumentation. The final structured caption integrates three components: (1) dense video description, (2) ambient sound characterization, and (3) background music analysis, providing unified multimodal representation for training. 45 Figure 33: Audio generation samples of MMAudio and ours. 46 Implementation details. Our V2A architecture generates high-fidelity stereo audio with maximum duration of 12 seconds at 44.1 kHz sampling rate. The model processes multimodal inputs through dedicated encoders: umT5-XXL produces 4096-dimensional text embeddings, while the CLIP extracts 1024-dimensional visual embeddings per frame. The audio and video features are projected into unified 1536-dimensional latent space within the DiT backbone. For temporal alignment, we downsample input videos and yield precisely 48 frames for 12-second clips, ensuring frame-accurate synchronization between visual and audio modalities. The system processes latent sequences of length 256 in one batch. To enhance the models capability of generating audio solely from visual cues, we implement random masking strategy during training where ambient sound and music captions are selectively omitted with predefined probability. This conditioning mechanism forces the model to establish robust cross-modal associations between visual content and corresponding audio patterns, while maintaining the flexibility to utilize textual descriptions when available."

            "title": "5.7.2 EVALUATION",
            "content": "We provide qualitative evaluations of audio generation in Fig. 33, where we compare our method with the recently released open-sourced approach MMAudio (Cheng et al., 2024). This comparative analysis is particularly meaningful as MMAudio represents the most similar and competitive baseline to our method, demonstrating impressive performance in audio generation tasks. The videos are generated by our text-to-video model with duration of 5 seconds. Our V2A model demonstrates superior performance in several key aspects of audio generation, as evidenced by the comparative results. Specifically, the model exhibits enhanced long-term consistency, particularly noticeable in the pouring coffee scenario (the first case in Fig. 33). In the second case of typing, our approach generates significantly cleaner audio output compared to the noisier results produced by MMAudio. Furthermore, our method excels in synthesizing rhythmic sound patterns, as demonstrated in the walking, boxing, and clip-clop examples (the last three cases in Fig. 33), where it achieves more natural and coherent audio generation. Limitations. Our method exhibits limitations in generating human vocal sounds, including but not limited to laughter, crying, and speech. This limitation is primarily attributed to our data preparation process, where speech-related vocal data is deliberately excluded from the training dataset. The MMAudio models ability to produce random speech-like sounds stems from its retention of speechrelated data in its training corpus. In our future work, we plan to incorporate speech generation capabilities to address this limitation."

            "title": "6 LIMITATION AND CONCLUSION",
            "content": "Limitation. This study presents Wan, foundational video generation model that has achieved notable advancements across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, significant improvements have been observed in motion amplitude (e.g., sports, dance) and instruction-following capabilities. Nevertheless, several limitations persist, which should be addressed to realize more potential of Wan. First, preserving fine-grained details in scenarios involving large motion remains challenge for our method, as well as broader issue within the field of video generation. Substantial efforts are required to improve the fidelity of videos with large-scale motion dynamics. Second, the computational cost associated with large-scale models remains prohibitive. Inference on 14B model currently requires approximately 30 minutes on single head-end GPU without additional optimization. To democratize video generation as universally accessible AI tool, further research into efficiency and scalability is essential. Finally, there is still lack of domain-specific expertise. As foundational video model, we are committed to enhancing Wans general capabilities, yet performance in specific localized scenarios, such as education and medicine, may be insufficient. We aim to address this limitation by open-sourcing our latest models and fostering community-driven development across diverse specialized domains. Conclusion. In this report, we publicly release Wan, our latest video model, which establishes new benchmark for video generation. We provide comprehensive overview of the architectural design of our Wan-VAE and DiT models, including detailed insights into their training approach, data curation processes, evaluation methods, and empirical results. Furthermore, we meticulously analyze our data preprocessing pipeline and the strategic adaptations implemented to optimize model training. This holistic approach is designed to drive advancements in the domain of video generation. We also extensively investigate downstream applications, such as image-to-video generation, video 47 editing, and personalized video generation, to demonstrate the versatility and practical utility of Wan across diverse scenarios. In addition to open-sourcing the 14B model, we explore the feasibility of leveraging smaller-scale models for efficient video generation. Notably, our 1.3B model not only achieves competitive performance compared to larger counterparts but also enables seamless inference on consumer-grade GPUs, significantly enhancing accessibility and practicality for content creators. Looking ahead, we plan to focus on scaling both data and model architectures to tackle the most pressing challenges in video generation. Our ongoing efforts aim to provide the research community with more robust and versatile tools for video creation, fostering innovation and broader adoption in this rapidly evolving field."
