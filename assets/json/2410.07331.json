            "content": "Data science is pivotal in extracting insights from data (Wang et al., 2021), fundamentally shaping decision-making and knowledge discovery. Traditionally, this field has required high proficiency in programming and specialized knowledge, which poses significant barriers to non-experts. However, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Team et al., 2023) has greatly enhanced their capabilities in code generation, grounding, and planning. This raises an intriguing question: Can LLMs become *Equal contribution. Corresponding authors. Figure 1: DA-Agent tackling an example in DA-Code. autonomous data scientists, capable of independent decision-making and solving agent data science problems? lously design an evaluation suite for each example, and conduct red teaming experiments to validate the robustness of the evaluations. We define the agent data science task as one that encompasses challenging task, diverse data source, and complex solution, as shown in Figure 1. First, code agent task is designed to explore data and utilize programming techniques to tackle challenging objectives, rather than simply translating explicit natural language instructions into code. Unlike previous benchmarks like DS-1000 (Lai et al., 2023) and Arcade (Yin et al., 2023), which focus on natural language grounding (Xie et al., 2022) and transforming instructions into executable code, our approach aligns more closely with real-world programming scenarios. Second, the data source is diverse, encompassing variety of information and data from real programming scenariosbeyond just notebook environment (Yin et al., 2023) or code-completion tasks (Lai et al., 2023). It includes different data types such as databases, spreadsheets, documents, code, and more. Moreover, these resources can be replete with distractions and extraneous information. Third, for task solutions, data analysts must engage in step-by-step thinking and reasoning process while programming. This involves inspecting data, writing minimal code, and continuous debugging. Additionally, they utilize Python, SQL, and Bash, which are commonly used programming languages in data science, to complete the tasks. To achieve this goal, we introduce DA-Code, benchmark for evaluating LLM data analysis ability, with carefully defined task scenarios. DA-Code contains 500 complex task examples, originating from real, challenging data analysis tasks, encompassing three main categories: data wrangling (DW), machine learning (ML) and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It covers the entire data analysis pipeline. Data wrangling includes variety of tasks such as data loading, data cleaning, and data merging, specifically targeting raw data in files and databases. EDA aims to gain insights and analysis using the given information and resources. It includes wide variety of data analysis tasks using programming languages such as SQL and Python to get insights from data. For ML tasks, how the model governs the entire ML pipeline is promising research direction. Each example in DA-Code is meticulously designed according to the standards of the code agent task mentioned above, ensuring high quality and complexity. We meticuDA-Code is inspired by the definitions used in intercode (Yang et al., 2024b). We create an interactive sandbox environment and implement DACode within this setting. This setup allows LLMs/Agents to explore the environment and engage in autonomous reasoning to complete tasks. This enables researchers to conduct their explorations in this user-friendly interactive environment. Based on this setting, we develop code agent baseline framework. This is capable of writing Python and SQL code and can interact with command lines, databases, and other interfaces. As shown in Figure 1, for this EDA task, the agent needs to explore all the resources provided to it, decide which files to use, write the code, and autonomously complete the task step by step. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art language models on DA-Code, and the experimental results indicate that achieving high scores on these tasks is challenging. For LLMs and LLM-Agents, autonomously completing real and complex data science tasks continues to be significant challenge. Overall, DA-Code represents an agent data science benchmark with challenging real-world settings, providing valuable data resources for current LLMagents aspiring to become data scientists."

            "content": "The traditional coding task can be represented as: code = (C, I) where code is the result of function that translates contextual information (environmental factors, constraints) and specific instructions (requirements, tasks) into executable code. In our coding task, interaction with the environment involves iterative code modification. The following sets are defined: (state space), (action space), (observation space), (code space), and (history space) defined as : O. The process can be represented as follows: Action Generation. The agent takes the memory mt and current state st to generate the next action at+1 and the updated code codet+1 C. We use the function : Figure 2: Annotation pipeline of DA-Code. See the start of Section 3.5 for detailed description. to represent this process. at+1, codet+1 = (mt, st) Action Execution. The environment then interprets the agents actions and code, executing them on the current state st to update the environment and obtain the new state st+1. It also returns the observation ot+1 O. This process can be represented by the function : S. ot+1, st+1 = g(at+1, codet+1, st) Memory Update. Subsequently, the agents memory mt is updated to mt+1 with the action at+1, code codet+1, and observation ot+1. This update is constrained by the memory window size k. If the updated memory length exceeds k, the agent will discard the earliest memory. This process can be represented by the function : H. mt+1 = h(mt {(at+1, codet+1, ot+1)}) This iterative process allows the agent to continually adapt and improve its code based on the evolving historical context until the agent takes an action that marks the completion of the task or reaches the maximum time set by the environment."

            "title": "2.2 Task Categories",
            "content": "DA-Code focuses on data science tasks and categorizes them into three major categories: data wrangling, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis. Data Wrangling. Data wrangling is the process of transforming and mapping raw data from one form into another to prepare it for analysis. It involves cleaning, loading, and transforming raw data into more usable format. This can include handling missing values, correcting errors, and merging datasets from different sources. The goal of data wrangling is to ensure that the data is consistent and easily accessible for tasks such as analytics, reporting, or machine learning applications. The examples are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4. Exploratory Data Analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis is technique used in data analysis to understand the main characteristics and get insights from dataset. There are many types of EDA tasks, which require LLMs to use combination of various Python libraries and SQL to complete complex data analysis tasks. The types of tasks included in DA-Code are statistical analysis, data manipulation, data insights, and data visualization. The example in Figure 1 is typical of this type of task. Data Manipulation is designed to perform intricate data operations using SQL and Pandas, efficiently processing large datasets. It primarily focuses on counting, summarizing data, and refining presentation formats. Data Insights focuses on tasks involving real data and issues encountered in actual scenarios. These problems do not provide clear solutions, necessitating thoughtful consideration and autonomous decision-making in coding for data analysis. The results are presented primarily in tables, or alternatively, in text format, to address and answer these questions. Visualization is similar to the previous category, with the unique aspect being that the results are presented in the form of charts. Statistical Analysis typically requires advanced knowledge of statistics and mathematics, involving the use of mathematical indicators for analysis.

In contrast, DA-Code integrates diverse array of agent tasks across the entire data science pipeline, covering broad spectrum of task types and data types (Figure 7), and result formats (such as Tables, Databases, Charts, Text, etc.). During the annotation process, our experienced annotators also categorize the difficulty of each task into three levels: easy, medium, and hard. Additionally, each example in DA-Code involves multiple files, averaging 5.7 files per task. This setup more closely mirrors real data analysis scenarios. 3.2 Complex Solution As shown in Table 1, we curate solution codes for each example, requiring an average of 85 lines of code to complete the tasks. Unlike previous benchmarks, DA-Code uses controllable executable environment to construct complex coding tasks that require interaction with the environment, planning and coding to complete tasks. Many tasks require the use of languages like SQL and Python, which aligns closely with real-world data science analysis scenarios."

For each data type, we implement carefully designed scripts to extract standardized information essential for evaluation. For tables, we do not compare the entire table but instead extract specific columns. For charts, we identify plotting scripts (e.g., plot.py) and use scripts to extract both numerical data and plotting parameters, which are then stored in numpy and JSON formats. For text-based outputs, we parse them into JSON format for comparison. Evaluation Configure. The evaluation setup for each task is customized through specific configuration, providing flexibility and ease in managing multiple tasks within the evaluation suite. Each task is uniquely identified, and necessary evaluation details, including output files, metrics, and options, are defined to meet the diverse requirements of different tasks. This structured approach enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the evaluation process."

Each output type has tailored metrics for comprehensive evaluation. Detailed scoring processes are provided in Appendix C. Table match score. The evaluation of tables involves comparing CSV files or databases, as well as the JSON format for text-based outputs, by matching two tables. The task instructions clearly specify the expected format, and the evaluation checks for an exact match between the task-specified columns in the predicted table and the reference table . The score is defined as: Score = (cid:40) if = 1, 0, otherwise perfect match results in score of 1, while any discrepancy results in score of 0. Chart match score. For chart evaluations, our script extracts key metadata from the predicted chart, including both the numerical data and plot configurations as specified in the task instructions. These components are then compared with the reference charts true values for numerical data and plot configurations I. The chart match score is calculated using the following rule: if = and = otherwise (cid:40) 1 0 Score = ML normalized score. For machine learning tasks, we utilize several standard metrics, including F1 Score, MAE, Silhouette Score, etc. Given the diverse nature of these metrics across different tasks, we apply normalization process to map the original scores onto 0-1 scale, ensuring consistency and comparability. The normalized score is computed using the following formula: (cid:18) (cid:18) Score = min 1, max 0, (cid:19)(cid:19) ˆs Sbaseline Sbest Sbaseline Here, ˆs represents the original score, Sbest is the upper performance limit, and Sbaseline is the lower bound."

            "content": "We recruit ten annotators who are highly proficient in data analysis, SQL, and Python to carry out data collection and annotation. As shown in Figure 2, the data annotation pipeline consists of the following steps: Manually Selecting Data Source. The data must come from actual data analysis and engineering projects. We require the datasets to be genuinely large and real, not simulated tables or texts. The data source must meet four principles: (1) realworld relevance, (2) complexity, (3) timeliness, and (4) coding intensity. We collect the most recent data sources from Kaggle, Github, and Other Web Sources. When collecting data, strive to select datasets that come with corresponding code and carefully verify their quality. Rewrite Task or Define New Task. According to the definition of data science agent task in Section 2, we have two ways to define tasks. The first method, rewrite task, involves completely redefining discovered task resources by transforming explicit code instructions into abstract agent task descriptions. The second method requires manually annotating new tasks based on these discovered resources. The majority of tasks are derived from conversions of the first type. Task Implementation. DA-Code tasks are set up in specialized Sandbox environment. The most critical step involves collecting the necessary resources for data analysis. The data we gather is noisy (a task may involve multiple files), and we ensure that this noisy data serves as the initial resource. For the examples shown in Figure 2, which originally only involved few databases, we create realistic setting by providing files required in real tasks, such as data_standard.md or schema.yml. The agent needs to extract useful information from these files to complete the task. Unlike traditional language grounding tasks, this process is challenging, requiring decision-making and reasoning. Evaluation Setup. Each examples evaluation configuration is meticulously designed based on our evaluation suite, as detailed in Section 3.3. Cross Validation and Red Team Test. We ask annotators to perform cross-validation to ensure each example has reasonable task design, appropriate environment setup, and robust evaluation. Additionally, they are required to conduct red team testing to determine if there are any false positives or false negatives."

(2024b), the environment of DA-Agent is built on the Docker platform, ensuring consistent and isolated setting crucial for replicable and independent data science experiments. This Linux environment comes equipped with essential data science tools, including Python, SQL, Conda, and database engines. 4.2 Action Space Previous approaches typically define actions in terms of editing or executing files. However, in our system, we innovatively combine these stages into single, streamlined actions that edit and execute code simultaneously. This approach not only reduces the complexity of interactions but also minimizes the number of steps required, thereby saving computational resources and enhancing model comprehension. Our action space is designed to efficiently manage diverse tasks, encompassing the following actions: Bash(command): Executes single-line bash commands directly. This enables quick file and directory manipulation and system command execution, providing direct interaction with the operating system. Python(save_path, code): Requires path and code content of the Python code, allowing the agent to handle complex data processing tasks and utilize Pythons extensive libraries. SQL(file_path, command, output): Executes SQL queries by specifying the database file, SQL command, and the output format. Results can be saved to specified file or displayed directly. Terminate(output): Concludes the task, specifying the result file or output text. This final action ensures that results are summarized and appropriately directed, marking clear end to the session. This diverse range of actions equips the agent with the capabilities to handle complex tasks across different environments, making it versatile tool in data manipulation and system operations."

Some commands execute successfully without producing visible output, in which case the system simply acknowledges their successful execution. Unacceptable Action. When the output format does not match the Action format, or the action is the same as the last one, please provide different action. Execution Timeout. The action execution time has exceeded the time limit. 4.4 Memory Windows To manage the context for the agents operations, memory window records the history of actions taken, constrained by max history length parameter. This parameter limits the number of previous steps the agent can recall.

Experimental results indicate that model performance decreases with increasing difficulty, validating our grading approach. 4) The models perform poorly on data wrangling tasks but fare better in machine learning challenges. This disparity could be linked to the training corpus, as DW and EDA tasks are less common and more complex to understand. Different Agent Framework with GPT-4. We randomly sample 100 tasks from DA-Code to create subset DA-Code-100 for comparison with several popular code agents. As shown in Table 4, our baseline DA-Agent outperforms these established agents on DA-Code, achieving higher score and completion rate. However, the overall performance remains modest, indicating substantial potential Reference Plan. DA-Code aims to assess the combined abilities of planning and grounding in LLM-agents. To further investigate the factors affecting model performance, we asked annotators to annotate the reference plan of DA-Code-100, as shown in Figure 4. This type of instruction describes step-by-step plan for solving task, serving as reference for the LLM Agents.

Conversely, models with more varied performance characteristics, like Deepseek-Coder, continue focusing on file operations. This suggests these models may have less developed ability to comprehend and adapt to the task environment effectively. Figure 6: Action type counts of DA-Agent with different LLMs across steps. Error Analysis. From our detailed examination of the DA-Agents actions across various models, Figure 4: The task instruction and the corresponding reference plan of the DA-Code example. The incompletion rates consistently decrease, particularly between 5 and 15 steps, which indicates the complexity of the tasks requiring multiple steps for resolution. Success rates rise sharply within the initial 5 to 10 steps before reaching plateau, even as incompletion rates continue to decline. This highlights fundamental challenge: if an agent fails to grasp the tasks requirements and come up with effective solution in the early steps, additional steps do not necessarily lead to successful outcomes, underscoring the limited capability of existing agents in handling complex prolonged task sequences. EEEA Pattern. Based on our in-depth analysis of DA-Agents task-solving steps using different LLMs and the classification of action types detailed in Table 5. As shown in Figure 6, we observe prevalent Exploration-ExecutionEvaluation-Adjustment pattern in the agents trajectories, which aligns well with our task scenarios. At the beginning of the task, barring instances of action extraction failure, each model tends to prioritize the File Viewing action to explore file contents and gain an understanding of the environment. As the task progresses, actions related to coding, such as invoking Python or executing SQL queries, become more prevalent. In the later stages of the task, higher-performing models like GPT-4 we identify several recurring issues that contribute to errors: Hallucination Issues: Agents often make incorrect assumptions about the environment, such as presuming file names and directly executing Python or SQL commands without initial exploration of available files. Inability to Follow Instructions: This leads to many non-standard reply formats and unrecognizable actions. Some models often start with non-standard actions but adjust in later steps. Persistent Code Errors: These errors cause failure to debug and correct issues, leading the model to become stuck in debugging loop. Misinterpretation of Task Context: Agents sometimes misinterpret task details, leading to premature termination and incomplete results. In conclusion, our findings underscore the current limitations of agents in tackling complex data challenges. This study provides crucial insights that can direct the enhancement of code agent capabilities through the development of more robust and context-aware strategies."

Our work focuses on data science, involving real and challenging tasks that cover the full pipeline. Code Agent Method The value of generative code models and interactive problem solving has motivated recent proliferation of work to augment reasoning capabilities of existing language models (Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Many agent methods have been proposed to solve code generation tasks. Direct interaction of agents with the Linux command line can cause many issues (Yang et al., 2024a). Several works (Yang et al., 2024b; Huang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024a) have designed special actions to standardize agent operations. OpenDevin (OpenDevin Team, 2024) is new agent for solving coding tasks. It is based on CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024), framework that consolidates LLM agents actions into unified code action space. We introduce DA-Agent, competitive agent framework designed for solving coding tasks, based on the DA-Code environment."

            "title": "A Task Examples",
            "content": "In this section, we present diverse examples in DA-Code. We have performed more detailed classification of tasks into three categories: DW, ML, and EDA, as shown in Figure 7. Data wrangling can be divided into data cleaning, data loading, and data transformation. Data Cleaning: Focuses on enhancing the datas quality by eliminating errors, imputing missing values, normalizing data in databases or raw datasets, and resolving inconsistencies to maintain the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data. Data Loading: Entails the consolidation of data from diverse sources into unified storage system, loading data according to specified standards and requirements, enabling streamlined access and consistent analytical practices. Data Transformation: Involves reformatting and restructuring data to better suit analytical models for targeted analysis. Figure 7: DA-Code task types proportion (Left) and file types proportion (Right) The EDA category covers wide range of tasks. In our benchmark, it is divided into Visualization, Statistical, Data Manipulation, and Data Insights. Data Manipulation: Data Manipulation is designed to perform intricate data operations using SQL and Pandas, efficiently processing large datasets. It primarily focuses on counting, summarizing data, and refining presentation formats. Data Insights: This section focuses on tasks involving real data and issues encountered in actual scenarios. These problems do not provide clear solutions, necessitating thoughtful consideration and autonomous decision-making in coding for data analysis. The results are presented primarily in tables, or alternatively, in text format, to address and answer these questions. Visualization: The format of visualization tasks is similar to the previous category, with the unique aspect being that the results are presented in the form of charts. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis tasks typically require advanced knowledge of statistics and mathematics, utilizing mathematical indicators for statistical analysis. ML tasks are categorized into three types: Classification, Regression, and Clustering. The reference solutions for these tasks require the use of corresponding ML algorithms to complete the assignments. In DA-Code, we select three foundational task categories: classification, regression, and clustering, from two sources: regular dataset tasks and competition tasks. Regular dataset tasks prioritize real-world applications, emphasizing comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering. Conversely, competition tasks present heightened challenge, requiring advanced algorithmic approaches to meet specific performance metrics. In the instructions, the task category is not directly provided; the model needs to autonomously determine the tasks category, design methods, and select models accordingly. Additionally, only traditional machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and random forests, are permitted, with no deep learning methods allowed. The final outputs consist of predictions on the test dataset provided.

The former relies on understanding the logic and structure of the code, which may lead to lower accuracy, while the latter has shown poor performance and high costs. We propose more reasonable and reliable evaluation method for visualizations. This method involves embedding scripts into code and executing them to directly obtain data, types, and other information corresponding to the chart. Specifically, given the following inputs: chart data d, image metadata J, the code used for generation, and the corresponding script. By embedding and executing the script within the generating code, we extract the predicted charts metadata ˆJ and data ˆd. The score is then calculated as follows: Score = (cid:40) 1 0 if = ˆd and = ˆJ otherwise Here, if the task does not explicitly restrict the order or scale of the data, and ˆd are the sorted or scaled versions of and ˆd. Additionally, and ˆj ˆJ, which are specific pieces of image information explicitly specified in the instructions, are compared from and ˆJ, respectively. C.1."

Figure 8: Example in data visualization task figsize \"figsize\" specifies the shape or dimensions of the image. It determines the width and height of the plot in inches. In our example, it is set to (10, 6) (not explicitly shown in the image, but set in the code). color \"color\" represents the color scheme used within the graph or visualization. It defines the hues applied to different data elements for differentiation or emphasis, like blue and orange in the example above. graph_title \"graph_title\" provides the overarching title or caption for the graph. It succinctly summarizes the purpose or main findings depicted in the visual representation, for example, Comparison of Animal Counts in the group. legend_title \"legend_title\" describes the title of the legend, which typically explains the meaning of different colors or symbols used in the graph. It aids in understanding the data categories or groups represented, such as Animal. \"labels\" refers to the labels associated with the visualized data points or categories. These labels labels provide context for interpreting the data. In the example above, it is Cat and Dog. x_label clarifies what the x-axis measures or represents, e.g., Group. \"x_label\" indicates the title for the x-axis, representing the horizontal dimension of the graph. It y_label It clarifies what the y-axis measures or represents, e.g., Count. \"y_label\" represents the title for the y-axis, which denotes the vertical dimension of the graph. xtick_labels \"xtick_labels\" refers to the specific labels assigned to individual ticks or points along the x-axis. These labels provide scale and context to the data points plotted on the x-axis, e.g., Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, Group 5. ytick_labels \"ytick_labels\" represents the specific labels assigned to ticks or points along the y-axis. Similar to xtick_labels, these labels provide scale and context to the data points plotted on the y-axis, e.g., 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. In this example, the task explicitly specifies the bar charts colors, graph_title, x_label, xtick_labels, y_label, legend_title, and labels. Therefore, during evaluation, we will filter out and compare these specific pieces of information. C.2 ML Task Evaluation To achieve consistent evaluation scores across machine learning tasks of varying difficulty levels and dataset sizes, we normalize evaluation metrics to scale of 0-1 by setting basic and best bounds. The best bound is determined by the top solutions in the dataset and the highest-ranked metric in the competition. The basic bound is established using baseline methods: for classification tasks, the metric of Proportional Classifier; for regression tasks, the metric of mean prediction; for clustering tasks, the metric of random clustering. In competition scenarios, the 80th percentile metric is used to determine the basic bound. Given the best bound Sbest, the basic bound Sbaseline, and the predicted score ˆs under the corresponding metric calculation, the scaled score is calculated as follows: (cid:18) Score = min max (cid:18) ˆs Sbaseline Sbest Sbaseline (cid:19) (cid:19) , 0 , 1 This formula ensures that the score is normalized between 0 and 1, adjusting for whether higher or lower values indicate better performance. Next, we will introduce the machine learning metrics used in DA-Code for classification, clustering, and regression tasks. C.2.1 Classification Tasks detailed description of the metrics used in classification tasks, including their definitions and formulas, is provided below: Accuracy Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances: Accuracy ="

Logarithmic Loss Logarithmic Loss (LogLoss) is metric used to evaluate the performance of classification model by measuring the accuracy of its predicted probabilities. It penalizes incorrect predictions, particularly those that are confidently incorrect. To avoid extremes, predicted probabilities are clipped using the formula max(min(p, 1e 15), 1 1e 15). LogLoss can be computed in two primary ways: One method involves averaging each class separately and then aggregating these averages. LogLoss = 1 (cid:88) 1 Nj Nj (cid:88) yij log(pij) j=1 where is the number of classes, Nj is the number of samples in class j, yij is binary indicator (0 or 1) if class label is the correct classification for sample i, and pij is the predicted probability of sample being in class j. i=1 Additionally, the other method involves averaging directly over all predictions without distinction by class.

Quadratic Weighted Kappa Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) is metric used to assess the agreement between two ratings or annotations. It measures the extent of agreement beyond chance, considering both the magnitude of disagreement and its quadratic impact. The formula for QWK is: κ = 1 (cid:80) (cid:80) i,j wijOij i,j wijEij where Oij is the observed agreement, Eij is the expected agreement, wij = (i j)2/(N 1)2 represents the squared difference between ratings and j, and is the total number of categories. C.2.2 Clustering Tasks The evaluation metric used for clustering tasks is introduced below. Silhouette Score Silhouette score is metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering in unsupervised learning. It measures how similar each sample is to its cluster compared to other clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, where higher value indicates that samples are well-clustered, with tight clusters and distinct separation between them. The formula for the Silhouette score for single sample is: s(i) = b(i) a(i) max(a(i), b(i)) where a(i) is the average distance from sample to other samples within the same cluster (intra-cluster distance), and b(i) is the average distance from sample to samples in the nearest neighboring cluster (inter-cluster distance). The overall Silhouette score is the mean of s(i) for all samples in the dataset. C.2.3 Regression Tasks The evaluation metrics used for regression tasks are introduced below. The Coefficient of Determination The coefficient of determination (R2) is used to evaluate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It indicates how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points. The formula for R2 is: R2 = 1 (cid:80)N i=1(yi ˆyi)2 i=1(yi y)2 (cid:80)N where is the number of observations, yi is the actual value, ˆyi is the predicted value, and is the mean of the actual values. An R2 value closer to 1 indicates better fit of the model to the data. Root Mean Squared Error Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the accuracy of regression models by measuring the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. It emphasizes larger errors due to squaring the differences. The formula for RMSE is: RMSE = (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116)"

Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) is used to evaluate the performance of regression models by measuring the logarithmic differences between predicted and actual values. It is particularly useful when the target variable spans several orders of magnitude. The formula for RMSLE is: RMSLE = (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116) (cid:88) (log(ˆyi + 1) log(yi + 1))"

Median Absolute Error Median Absolute Error (MedAE) is used to evaluate the accuracy of regression models by measuring the median of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It provides robust metric that is less sensitive to outliers. The formula for MedAE is: MedAE = median(ˆyi yi) where ˆyi is the predicted value and yi is the actual value. Lower MedAE values indicate better model performance, with the metric focusing on the central tendency of errors. Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) is used to evaluate the accuracy of regression models by measuring the percentage error between predicted and actual values, treating overand under-predictions equally. The formula for SMAPE is: SMAPE = (cid:88) 100% ˆyi yi (ˆyi + yi)/2 i=1 where is the number of observations, ˆyi is the predicted value, and yi is the actual value. Lower SMAPE values indicate better model performance, with the metric providing balanced view of relative prediction errors. Prompts of DA-Agent Following the ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) prompting framework, which guides models in breaking down complex problems into manageable steps through an iterative chain of reasoning (Reasoning), action (Action), and observation (Observation) phases, where the current state is observed after each action before proceeding to the next step of reasoning, we build the DA-Agent.
