            "content": "The rapid rise of visual media on online platforms has made image content safety pressing concern, especially with the ever-increasing volume of content being shared daily (Calzavara et al., 2016). Inappropriate or harmful imagery, including those containing explicit sexual content, graphic violence, or other forms of disturbing material, poses significant challenges for platform moderation and user safety. This issue becomes even more critical in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), where highly capable image generation models can easily produce unsafe content (Schramowski et al., 2022; Tsai et al., 2023; Qu et al., 2024). Therefore, the approach to detect and mitigate the spread of harmful visual material based on safety constitution (Bai et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2024) (i.e., set of rules defining unsafe images) is important. Existing solutions for image safety judgment, whether using traditional classifiers or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) (Liu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Deitke et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), largely depend on human annotators (Schramowski et al., 2022; Rando et al., 2022; nsf; Helff et al., 2024), who manually label unsafe content based on established safety constitution. While effective, this process is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, making it difficult to scale. Furthermore, the complexity and intricacy of modern safety guidelines make it challenging for human annotators to consistently apply them without extensive training and supervision. Also, users of safety assessment systems may need to frequently modify guidelines, making human annotation based solutions sigficantly more challenging. Therefore, there is 1 (a) Challenge 1: Image safety judgment based on subjective rules is difficult task. Even humans struggle to determine whether this image is suitable for public viewing or not. The MLLM model used here is GPT4o (gpt). (b) Challenge 2: Current MLLMs struggle to reason with complex, lengthy safety rules. The rule applies to imminent death scenarios, this image clearly does not depict one. The model used here is LLaVA-OneVisionQwen2-72b-ov-chat (Li et al., 2024). (c) Challenge 3: MLLMs have inherent biases. Despite the absence of throat slit, the MLLM predicts rule violation due to its bias, linking blood on the ground, foreleg, and feet to throat slit. Model here is InternVL28B-AWQ (Chen et al., 2023). Figure 1 Examples showing the challenges for simply querying pre-trained MLLMs for zero-shot image safety judgment. growing interest in leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs for automating image safety judgments in zero-shot manner based on set of safety rules. If successful, it could significantly reduce the costs associated with collecting training samples and human annotations. We find that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs alone on the safety constitution is insufficient for reliable image safety detection. This unsatisfactory performance can be attributed to the following factors. Challenge 1 : The subjective or ambiguous safety rules (e.g., should not depict sexual images) influence the effectiveness of the zero-shot safety judgment (see example in Figure 1a). Challenge 2 : Current MLLMs struggle to reason with complex, lengthy safety rules (see example in Figure 1b). Challenge 3 : There are inherent biases within the MLLMs. Figure 1c demonstrate an example for the biases on the non-centric region in the images. Another type of bias stemming from language priors is that MLLMs inherently tend to give specific judgments in response to certain questions. To solve these problems, we propose our method CLUE (Constitutional MLLM JUdgE) that significantly enhances the effectiveness of zero-shot safety judgments. For Challenge 1 (subjective and ambiguous safety rules), our approach objectifies the safety constitutiontransforming them into objective, actionable rules that MLLMs can process more effectively. To tackle Challenge 2, our framework uses MLLM to evaluate one safety rule from the constitution at time for each inspected image, systematically going through all rules. To simplify reasoning on complex or lengthy rules, each safety rule is transformed into set of logically complete precondition chains. To accelerate the process for iterating all rules, we employ multi-modal contrastive model such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), to measure the relevance of each rule to the image content and filter out clearly irrelevant (image, rule) pairs before sequentially pass the relevant rules to the MLLM. For Challenge 3 (inherent biases within MLLMs), we perform debiased token probability analysis to reduce biases from both language priors and non-central image regions, using the debiased token probabilities to predict safety results. Our method operates as multi-stage reasoning framework. When the token probability approach lacks sufficient confidence, it enables deeper reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thoughts as needed. Through extensive experiments on different MLLMs, e.g., Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct (Wang et al., 2024), InternVL2-8B-AWQ (Chen et al., 2023), LLaVA-v1.6-34B (Liu et al., 2024) and InternVL2-76B (Chen et al., 2023), we validate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of zero-shot image safety judgments, offering scalable solution to the growing challenge of moderating visual contents using MLLM. For example, our method achieves 95.9% recall, 94.8% accuracy and 0.949 F-1 score with InternVL2-76B on distinguishing Unsafe/Safe images based on complex safety constitution."

            "content": "Image Content Safety. Image content safety has become critical challenge as visual media spread across online platforms. For example, the users may upload numerous images that is not appropriate for public viewing onto the social media platforms (Calzavara et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2024; Rizwan et al., 2024). In 2 the AIGC era, many existing image generation models have the capabilities to generate unsafe images (e.g., images includes sexual or violence content) (Schramowski et al., 2022; Gandikota et al., 2023; Tsai et al., 2023; Chin et al., 2023; Qu et al., 2024). Thus, it is important to detect and filter these unsafe or inappropriate image content. Safety Judge Models. Developing safety judge models presents promising approach to addressing the content safety problem (Lin et al., 2023; Schramowski et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024; Helff et al., 2024). These models can be employed to assess user-generated data as well as the input and output of generative AI systems for potential safety concerns. Initially, most safety judge models relied on conventional classifiers, such as ToxDectRoberta (Zhou et al., 2021) and for text safety evaluation, and Q16 (Schramowski et al., 2022), SD Safety Checker (Rando et al., 2022), NSFW Detector (nsf), and NudeNet (nud) for image safety assessment. More recently, researchers have begun exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct safety judge models (Helff et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2023; Kang and Li, 2024). Most of these models, including LLaVA Guard (Helff et al., 2024), rely on annotated data and fine-tuning. However, this approach has limitations: the process of human annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and these methods often struggle with generalization. While some studies have investigated the zero-shot performance of MLLMs on safety judgment tasks, the results have been less than satisfactory (Kumar et al., 2024; Rizwan et al., 2024). In this work, we aim to close this gap and improve the MLLM-based image safety judgment in zero-shot manner."

Problem Formulation. Given an image and safety constitution (i.e., set of safety rules such as Table 1), our objective is twofold: first, to determine whether the image violates any guideline in G, and second, to provide list of all identified violated rules. Formally, we can express this as function A(x, G) (s, R), where represents the safety label (either safe or unsafe) and denotes the specific safety rules violated by the inspected image."

            "content": "Most existing image safety assessment methods (Schramowski et al., 2022; nsf; Helff et al., 2024) rely on subjective or ambiguous rules, such as should not depict unsafe images or should not depict sexual content. We argue that such subjective or ambiguous guidelines significantly hinder effective zero-shot safety judgment tasks. These rules create numerous borderline cases where even human experts struggle to determine safety. Therefore, we propose objectifying the safety rules and focusing on these objective rules. While some may argue that certain safety-related aspects like sexual content, violence, or unsafe are inherently subjective, these concepts can be broken down into several objective sub-categories as needed. We achieve the rule objectification by using LLM-as-an-Optimizer (Yang et al., 2024). Starting with an initial constitution, we prompt LLM to evaluate the objectivity of each rule using the template in Figure 9. Rules scoring below 9 out of 10 are repeatedly revised to reach minimum score of 9, enhancing objectivity where possible (perfect objectivity can be challenging, so we set 9 out of 10 as practical threshold). Similar to the Code Completion task (Raychev et al., 2014), we also allow human users to adjust critical parameters in the objectified rules, such as the 90 degrees in the rule should not have their legs spread apart by an angle exceeding 90 degrees. An example of the objectified constitution in Table 1, based on the original constitution shown in Table 7. The objectiveness score of each rule in the original constitution and the objectified constitution are also demonstrated. We use the objectified constitution in Table 1 as the default for our experiments."

            "content": "The reasoning capability of current MLLMs is limited when dealing with complex and lengthy constitutions. To work around this, we enumerate all rules and input them one at time into the MLLM. However, enumerating all rules can be costly and inefficient, especially since many of the rules may be obviously irrelevant to the inspected image. To address this, we need an effective mechanism to filter out unrelated rules. Our approach 3 leverages pre-trained text and image encoders CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) to calculate the cosine similarity between the inspected image and each guideline. Formally, we consider an inspected image and rule to be relevant if cos(I(x), (r)) > t, where is relevance threshold, I(x) is the encoded image feature, and (r) is the encoded text feature of the rule. This method is significantly faster than querying MLLM because the size of text/image encoders (typically in the range of hundreds of millions of parameters) is much smaller compared to existing MLLMs (often billions of parameters). By implementing this embedding-similarity-based relevance checking, we substantially boost the inference speed of the inspection process, making it more efficient and practical."

            "content": "Although we already enumerate all rules and input them one at time into the MLLM, reasoning on some lengthy and complex rules are still challenging for current MLLM. For example, as we demonstrated in Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14, even the most advanced MLLM GPT-4o (gpt) fails to predict under the complex rule, but it can infer the satisfication of the precondition (i.e., condition that must be met or satisfied before determining the violation of the rule) of the rule correctly. To make the reasoning on the safety rules easier, we propose an approach for automatically decomposing the safety rule into set of logically complete yet simplified precondition chains. Figure 2 shows our idea and the example for decomposing the rules. Given rule such as Should not have any depiction of people or animals whose bodies have suffered visible, bloody injuries that seem to cause their imminent death, the rule is converted into precondition chain: [[people are visible via this image] OR [animals are visible via this image]] AND [the body has suffered visible, bloody injuries] AND [the injuries seem to cause imminent death]. We consider the rule is violated only if all preconditions are fulfilled. The precondition chain is automatically generated by LLM. The detailed process for producing precondition chain is demonstrated in Figure 10. Figure 2 Example of the preconditions extracted from the rule."

            "title": "3.4 Debiased Token Probability based Judgment",
            "content": "To checking if each precondition is fullfilled or not, we query the pre-trained LLMs in zero-shot manner. The process is shown in Figure 3. We define the precondition score as the probability of the token Yes divided by the sum of the probability of token Yes and No. We consider precondition is fullfilled if the precondition score is higher than threshold value. This query process is efficient as we only need the model to output one token. The question is: How to determine the threshold for the fullfillment of the precondition. An intuitive way is using 0.5 as the threshold, which indicating the token probability of Yes is larger than that of token No. However, this method is not effective due to the token probability bias in MLLMs. Bias from Language Prior. Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2024) and Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2024) demonstrated that the token probability of MLLM will be influenced by the language prior of the model. Inspired by their work, we explored this effect and confirmed that it also impacts the safety judgment task. For example, the token probability for Yes on the question Is the following content visible via this image? Answer Yes or No. Content: The visible, bloody injuries indicate imminent death based on the severity of the injury. is below 0.5 on InternVL2-76B (Chen et al., 2023) for large fraction of images including the corresponding unsafe content. This is because the language prior of this model indicates this content is highly impossible to occur based on its training data. 4 Figure 3 Process of calculating token based score. The precondition is considered satisfied if the score is larger than threshold. Figure 4 Approach for mitigating the bias from the non-centric content in the image. We compare the token probability based score (see Figure 3) of the original image and the image with centric region removed, and consider the image satisfy the precondition if the difference of the score is large enough. Bias from Image. Besides the bias from the language prior, we also find the non-centric part in the image can also bring strong bias. For example, if human in an image has bare upper body, the MLLM might incorrectly give the question Is the persons buttocks is unclothed? high token probability for Yes, even if they are fully covered. This is because the images with human having bare upper body are often with unclothed buttocks in the training data of the MLLM, making the MLLM learn strong correlation between naked upper body and naked lower body. Mitigating Token Probability Bias. Based on our analysis, it is important to mitigate the token probability bias when conducting the token probability based judgment. Given MLLM M, an inspected image x, and precondition c, we denote the precondition score (see Figure 3) as M(x, c). Strategy 1: Score Differences between Queries with and without Image Tokens. To mitigate bias stemming from language priors, we consider the precondition score in the absence of the image. Specifically, we remove all image tokens while retaining all text tokens in the MLLM, then compute the precondition score in this scenario, represented as M(None, c). We find that if the precondition score with image M(x, c) is lower than M(None, c), it is likely that the image does not satisfy the precondition. Conversely, if M(x, c) is significantly higher than M(None, c), it is highly possible that the precondition is satisfied. Strategy 2: Score Differences between Whole and Centric-region-Removed Images. We also design another approach to mitigate bias from both language prior and non-centric content in images, as illustrated in Figure 4. This approach can effectively reduce bias from non-centric objects, such as blood on the ground. Given precondition c, we first use the model to generate description of the centric object (see more details in appendix A.3) and then employ the state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detector OWLv2 (Minderer et al., 2024) to extract the centric region i. We then compare the precondition scores of the original image M(x, c) and the image with the centric region removed, denoted as M(x i, c). Our findings suggest that if M(x, c) is significantly higher than M(x i, c), and the bounding box predicted by the open-vocabulary object detection model has high confidence (0.05 by default), it is highly likely that the precondition is satisfied. Because the predicted bounding box confidence isnt always high, we combine both strategies when 5 the object detection models confidence is high, and use only strategy 1 otherwise.

Additionally, reasoning-based judgment can provide explanations, which are essential for handling difficult or borderline cases. In this reasoning stage, we follow cascading process: first, we prompt the model to evaluate whether the image violates the specified guideline using chain-of-thought prompt without requiring specific format.

For given rule, once the preconditions are extracted, it can be used on different inspected images with the stored preconditions.

To address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we constructed dataset named Objective Safety Bench (OS Bench).

Four MLLMs across multiple sizes are used, i.e., Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct (Wang et al., 2024), InternVL2-8B-AWQ (Chen et al., 2023), LLaVA-v1.6-34B (Liu et al., 2024) and InternVL2-76B (Chen et al., 2023). The test dataset used here is our OS Bench (Section 4.1). The results can be found in Table 2. We can see that CLUE significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Since our setting requires constructing the detector without human labeling, we compare our method to the default models trained on their respective datasets and inference on OS Bench. The key aim of this table is to show that existing fine-tuning-based methods lack generalizability beyond the safety rules used in training/fine-tuning. Q16 (Schramowski et al., 2022), SD Filter (Rando et al., 2022), NSFW Detector (nsf) and LLaVA Guard (Helff et al., 2024). The results are shown in Table 3. Because our approach requires constructing the detector without human labeling, we compare our method to default models trained on their respective datasets and then applied to OS Bench (Section 4.1). The main purpose of this table is to demonstrate that existing fine-tuning-based methods lack robust generalizability beyond the specific safety rules used during training or fine-tuning. As can be observed, CLUE outperforms existing fine-tuning based baseline methods on the label-free setting by large margin, indicating the effectiveness of our method and reflecting that fine-tuning based baselines lack generalizability beyond the specific safety rules used during training or fine-tuning. Effectiveness for Finding Violated Rules. Besides binary classification as Unsafe or Safe, we further evaluate our method by analyzing the precision, recall, accuracy and F-1 for distinguishing the unsafe images labeled under each safety rule and their corresponding borderline safe images. The results are demonstrated in Table 4. We use InternVL2-76B model (Chen et al., 2023) here. Here, the prediction is considered correct only if the method accurately identifies the ground-truth violated rules. If the ground-truth violated rules are missed, the prediction is considered incorrect. As shown, our method effectively identifies ground-truth rule violations in images and reliably differentiates these from borderline safe images. 9 (a) Score distribution of InternVL276B on the precondition The visible, bloody injuries indicate imminent death based on the severity of the injury.

Figure 6 Score distributions across different models under different preconditions. We show the score distributions for queries containing images with ground-truth label Satisfied the precondition and Not Satisfied the precondition.

            "content": "Effectiveness of Constitution Objectification. We first study the influence of the constitution objectification module introduced in Section 3.1. In detail, we compare the results on objectified rule and its corresponding rule before the objectification. The results are shown in Table 5. Note that for each rule, we use text-to-image diffusion model to generate 50 images violating it and 50 corresponding borderline safe image (see detailed test data craft process in Section 4.1). As can be observed, the accuracy is much higher for the objectified rule, indicating constitution objectification is important for the zero-shot image safety judgment task. Effectiveness of Relevance Scanning. We then examine the effectiveness of our relevance scanning module described in Section 3.2. In detail, we measure its recall in keeping the ground-truth violated rules for each image and calculate the fraction of rules that remain after filtering through the relevance scanning module. The results are displayed in Figure 7. The encoder used here is our default relevance scanning encoder, i.e., clip-vit-base-patch16 (Radford et al., 2021). Additionally, we provide results for siglip-so400m-patch14384 (Zhai et al., 2023) in Figure 11. Both Figure 7 and Figure 11 highlight the high effectiveness of our relevance scanning module. For instance, with default similarity threshold on CLIP, the module maintains recall of 96.6% for keeping ground-truth rules while filtering out 67% of rules, significantly improving the efficiency. Effectiveness of Debiased Token Probability based judgment. We also study the effectiveness of the token probability debiasing modules introduced in Section 3.4. The ablation study on InternVL2-8B-AWQ can be 10 (a) Recall for ground truth rules. (b) Fraction of remaining rules. Figure 7 Detailed performance of Relevance Scanning module (see subsection 3.2) with CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) on OS Bench.

To further study the effects of this module, we conduct more investigation in this section. Effectiveness of score differences between queries with and without image tokens. For the strategy that uses score differences between queries with and without image tokens, we illustrate the score distributions on OS Bench for image-containing queries across different models and preconditions, along with the corresponding scores for queries without image tokens, in Figure 6. We can observe large portion of images with groundtruth label Satisfied the precondition have score lower than 0.5, reflecting the necessity of the debiasing method. Also, the results confirm that if the score with the image is lower than that of the corresponding query without image token, it is likely that the image does not satisfy the precondition. Conversely, it strongly suggests that the precondition is satisfied if the score with images tokens is significantly larger than the score without image token, showing our strategy is effective. Effectiveness of score differences between whole and centric-region-removed images. For the strategy that leverages score differences between whole images and centricregion-removed images, we present the distribution of these differences on OS Bench in Figure 4. The model used here is InternVL2-8B-AWQ. As shown, when the score of the whole significantly higher image is than that of the central-regionremoved image, it strongly suggests that the precondition is met, indicating the effectiveness of this strategy. Figure 8 Distribution of score differences calculated using our image-level debiasing approach (see Figure 4)."

Table 8 Detailed seed prompts used to construct OS Bench. A.3 Details for Central Object Word Extraction Similar to the precondition extraction, we also prompt LLM to extract the words for central object in each precondition so that we can obtain the inputs for open vocabulary object detection models. The detailed prompts and process are demonstrated in Figure 10. The LLM we used for central object word extraction is also Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024). Details for Constructing Objective Safety Bench (OS Bench) As we introduced in Section 4.1, we use the state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model to create unsafe/safe images. Specifically, we start by gathering an initial set of seed prompts. These seed prompts serve as foundation, and we then use LLMs to rewrite and expand on them, enriching the content to create diverse set of prompts. This process increases the variety and depth of the prompts. The detailed seed prompts used for the unsafe images violating different rules and that for corresponding borderline safe images are shown in Table 8. 3 (a) Recall for ground truth rules. (b) Fraction of remaining rules. Figure 11 Detailed performance of similarity based relevance scanning with SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023)."

We first show more results of the relevance scanning module described in Section 3.2. Besides the results with relevance scanning encoder clip-vit-base-patch16 (Radford et al., 2021), we also demonstrate the results on siglip-so400m-patch14-384 (Zhai et al., 2023) in Figure 11. The results indicate that the relevance scanning module is effective on different relevance scanning encoder. Effectiveness of Precondition Extraction. We also conduct the ablation study to investigate the effects of the precondition extraction module introduced in Section 3.3. The results are demonstrated in Table 10. As can be observed, the accuracy and the F-1 score for the safety judgment task reduces significantly if we remove the precondition extraction module in our method, indicating the effectiveness of this module. In Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14, we show more examples and visualizations demonstrating the effects and necessities of the precondition extraction."

Effectiveness of Score Differences between Whole and Centric-region-removed Images. We then discuss the effectiveness of score differences between whole and centric-region-removed images. The results are presented in Table 11. As shown, this module not only improves the recall of our method but also reduces the number of cascaded reasoning processes required for each image. This enhances the overall efficiency of our approach, as the cascaded reasoning process is only initiated for each precondition when the token-probability-based judgment lacks high confidence. 4 Method Rule Precision Recall Accuracy F-1 Prior Knowledge + Directly Answer Yes/No Prior Knowledge + COT Reasoning Inputting Entire Constitution in Query + Directly Answer Yes/No Inputting Entire Constitution in Query + COT Reasoning CLUE (Ours) Genitalia Buttocks Breast Touching on bed Shower Kissing Legs spread Knees Bending Fire Internal organs Decay Imminent death Dead from arm Genitalia Buttocks Breast Touching on bed Shower Kissing Legs spread Knees Bending Fire Internal organs Decay Imminent death Dead from arm Genitalia Buttocks Breast Touching on bed Shower Kissing Legs spread Knees Bending Fire Internal organs Decay Imminent death Dead from arm Genitalia Buttocks Breast Touching on bed Shower Kissing Legs spread Knees Bending Fire Internal organs Decay Imminent death Dead from arm"

Table 12 summarizes the average runtime per image for our approach across different MLLM models, using the specified inference engine and devices. While our method is slower than the approach of inputting the entire constitution into single query, similar to OpenAIs O1, it achieves significantly better safety judgment performance, aligning with the inference time scaling law of LLMs. To improve efficiency, we propose various enhancements, including relevance scanning and token-probability-based judgments for cases with high confidence. Furthermore, our method can function as an auto-labeler for safety judgment tasks. Its predictions can be directly used as training or fine-tuning labels for smaller MLLM, effectively distilling our method into simpler one-step model without adding overhead during inference. Importantly, the cost shown in Table 12 is substantially lower than the expense of human labeling, highlighting the practicality of our approach.
