            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their remarkable capabilities in various domains, including but not limited to math and code reasoning (Guo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2024; Huang and Yang, 2025), interactive tool usage (Team et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025), and conversational agents (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Comanici et al., 2025; Grattafiori et al., 2024). Among these capabilities, instruction-following (IF) is arguably one of the most fundamental focuses of LLM development as it underlies agents ability to generalize to novel tasks and translate user intent into desired outputs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021). While contemporary LLMs can already follow direct and simple instructions quite well, they are still struggling to deal with users complex instructions, which is quite common and challenging, as the instructions may contain multiple user intentions spanned over different turns of the conversation (He et al., 2024; Deshpande et al., 2025). Meanwhile, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become powerful post-training technique to improve LLMs reasoning capabilities on math and code tasks, where the models generations can be easily scored by matching the final answers of math problems or unit tests for programming (Guo et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025). However, RLVR cannot be applied directly to improve LLMs IF capabilities, as it is non-trivial to verify whether models response fully follows users instructions, especially for the hard ones. While training reward model from pairwise data (Ouyang 1 Figure 1 Example of AdvancedIF benchmark. The example is from the capability of multi-turn carried context where prompts and rubrics written by human experts. et al., 2022) can provide proxy for the ground truth reward, such an approach relies on vast amount of preference data and the resulting reward signal is usually uninterpretable and prone to reward hacking (Bai et al., 2022a). To further unleash the power of RL, we propose to use rubric-based RL to improve LLMs advanced IF capabilities during post-training. IF tasks are naturally suitable for rubric-based RL, as complex instructions usually can be decomposed into simpler ones, which can be verified relatively easily. In fact, rubric-based verifiers are already deployed in challenging IF benchmarks (Zhou et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Deshpande et al., 2025). However, developing scalable learning pipeline for advanced IF still faces several challenges: Lack of high-quality rubrics for evaluations: Most of the existing benchmarks either have LLM-generated prompts or LLM-generated rubrics. Reliable rubric generator and verifier. Given user prompt from the large-scale training data where human labeling is impractical, we need generator to synthesize corresponding rubrics to evaluate the response, and verifier to judge whether response complies with the rubric. How to design good generator and verifier to provide reliable rubrics and judgments for training is still an open problem. Reward hacking issues. Reward hacking can happen to exploit certain criteria, and we need additional strategies to address such issues during RL. To address these challenges, we highlight the following contributions in our work. First, we introduce AdvancedIF, new high-quality human-annotated benchmark for evaluating LLMs advanced IF capabilities: Expert-written prompts. All prompts in AdvancedIF are carefully written by human experts. In particular, in the multi-turn conversation category, human experts interacted with LLM to provide an appropriate prompt according to the model response at the last turn, reflecting the real user engagement behavior and style. Expert-written rubrics. Each prompt is paired with rubric, which was first written by human expert and then went through multiple rounds of human review, reflecting granular criteria of the prompt. An example is shown in Figure 1. Comprehensive assessment. AdvancedIF contains 1,600+ prompts including three important aspects of instruction following: (a) Complex instruction following: each prompt has 6+ instructions with combination of one, format, style, structure, length, negative constraints, spelling, and inter-conditional instructions; 2 Figure 2 Framework of RIFL. (b) Multi-turn instruction following: the ability to follow instruction carried from previous; and (c) System prompt steerability: The ability to follow instructions in the system prompt. Challenging benchmark. We benchmark SoTA LLMs such as GPT5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet, the best result achieved by them is around 70%, which shows IFAdvanced is quite challenging and can better reflect the gap between existing LLMs and the north star. Second, to address the aforementioned challenges of rubric-based RL training, we introduce our pipeline, Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning (RIFL), full-stack IF post-training pipeline as illustrated in Figure 2, which includes three key components: (a) To generate high-quality prompts and rubrics at scale, we train rubric generator based on small set of expert-written data. (b) To build reliable verifier, we leverage golden set of human-annotated rubric-based evaluations and develop finetuning pipeline to train an LLM-based judge as the rubric verifier. (c) To address the reward hacking issue, we introduce additional criteria as reward shaping technique. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of RIFL. Our results show that RIFL significantly improves the instruction-following capabilities of Llama 4 Maverick on various challenging benchmarks. Specifically, RIFL achieves 6.7% absolute improvement on our newly proposed AdvancedIF benchmark, and also shows strong performance on public benchmarks like MultiChallenge and IFEval. Our ablation studies confirm the superiority of our finetuned rubric verifier over vanilla LLM judges and demonstrate the effectiveness of our reward design and shaping. These strong empirical results highlight the efficacy of our proposed RIFL pipeline, showing the promise of rubric-based RL for both training and evaluation of advanced instruction-following capabilities of LLMs."

            "content": "Instruction Following in LLMs. Instruction following is key capability of LLMs that has been extensively studied in recent years, including various approaches to evaluate and improve LLMs ability to understand and execute human instructions. For instance, efforts in instruction tuning have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on carefully curated sets of instructions can significantly enhance their zero-shot performance on unseen instructions (Sanh et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2024). More recently, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017) has been employed to align LLMs more closely with user intent, leading to models that better adhere to instructions in practice (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). Parallel to these advancements, the evaluation of instruction-following capabilities has also seen significant 3 progress. Various benchmarks have been proposed to assess how well LLMs can follow instructions across different contexts and complexities, using powerful LLMs as judges (Zheng et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2024) or verifiable rubrics as metrics (Zhou et al., 2023; He et al., 2024). While current frontier LLMs demonstrate strong performance on many instruction-following tasks, challenges remain, particularly in handling complex, multiturn instructions or instructions that require reasoning over long contexts (He et al., 2024; Deshpande et al., 2025), which motivates our work to further explore and address these limitations through rubric-based training and evaluation. Our proposed benchmark, AdvancedIF, is mostly related to MultiChallenge (Deshpande et al., 2025), which aims to evaluate LLMs multi-turn IF capabilities with instance-level rubrics. However, our benchmark provides more holistic evaluation covering broader scopes (Table 2 and Section A) and features pure expert-written prompts and rubrics for more realistic and aligned evaluation. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has become dominant paradigm to further align LLMs with human preferences after pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. The seminal work from Ouyang et al. (2022) popularized RLHF for LLMs by introducing three-step process: (a) collecting human preference data comparing model outputs, (b) training reward model to predict these preferences, and (c) fine-tuning the LLM using reinforcement learning to optimize for the learned reward signal. However, RLHF relies on large amounts of preference data and learned reward function that is imperfect and opaque, which can lead to issues like reward hacking (Liu et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2022a). To mitigate these issues, recent work has explored alternative reward signals that are more transparent and verifiable. For instance, in domains with clear correctness criteria, such as coding and math, researchers have leveraged programmatic success signals (e.g., passing unit tests or reaching known answer) to train models via reinforcement learning and significantly improve LLMs reasoning capabilities (Guo et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025). However, applying these methods to general instruction following remains challenging due to the lack of automatic success criteria, motivating our exploration of rubric-based rewards to bridge the gap between human preferences and verifiable signals. Rubric-based RL. Our work is closely related to previous and concurrent work that also explores the use of rubrics in reinforcement learning. For example, Bai et al. (2022b) propose Constitutional AI, which uses set of principles to guide model behavior through self-improvement without direct human feedback. More recently, Zhou et al. (2025); Viswanathan et al. (2025) show that checklists or rubrics can be used to generate responses for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) or Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO; Guo et al., 2025) and achieve better alignment. However, these works primarily focus on using rubrics to generate preference data or guide model behavior indirectly, whereas our approach directly incorporates rubric-based rewards into the reinforcement learning process to provide more structured and interpretable feedback signal for instruction following. Concurrently, Gunjal et al. (2025) and Huang et al. (2025) also explore using rubric-based rewards for RL training, but they mainly focus on the synthetic rubric generation setting with relatively small-scale LLMs on general tasks. In contrast, our work focuses on the full-stack rubric-based training and evaluation pipeline to improve LLMs instruction-following capabilities at scale, including high-quality human-annotated rubrics collection, rubric generator and verifier training, and large-scale RLHF training with rubric-based rewards. Our experiments on LLMs of varying scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing instruction-following performance, particularly on complex tasks that require nuanced understanding and execution of instructions."

For these open-ended and unverifiable instructions, an effective method is to decompose the evaluation task into collection of criteria (rubric) and then leverage LLMs to check if each criterion is met by the response. We propose novel rubric-based benchmark aiming to evaluate LLMs advanced instruction following ability: AdvancedIF, where each prompt and its rubric are carefully created by human experts. AdvancedIF is composed of three important aspects of instruction following abilities to comprehensively assess LLMs: Explicit and Complex User Instruction Following: The ability to follow explicit user instruction.

System Prompt Steerability: The ability to follow instructions in the system prompt. Constraints in the system prompt include the response style, safety, different product context settings, e.g., voice and tool-use specifications. We present the basic statistics of AdvancedIF in Table 1. We also compare AdvancedIF with existing verifiable and rubric-based instruction following benchmarks in Table 2 and show that AdvancedIF is the only one whose prompts and rubrics are manually created by human experts and has dialogs with multi-turn conversation and system prompts. This comprehensive coverage enables AdvancedIF to best simulate real user-bot interactions and set up high standards for LLMs IF capabilities."

            "title": "4.1 Formulation",
            "content": "Similar to previous work (Ouyang et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2025), our post-training pipeline can be formulated as Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. Specifically, we aim to maximize the following objective: (πθ) = E(q,r)D (cid:2)Eoπθ(q)[R(q, o, r)] βDKL[πθ(q)πref(q)](cid:3) , (1) where πθ and πref are the training LLM and the reference policy, respectively. Different from the Reinforcement Learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) setting, where the outcome reward R(q, o) can be directly computed via hard-coded scripts such as unit tests for code generation or string matching for math answers, rubric-based RL requires more sophisticated rewarding system to get the sequence-level reward R(q, o, r): (a) For each prompt q, it corresponds to unique set of criteria = {ri}d to measure whether response fully follows the instructions specified in q; (b) Given prompt q, response o, and rubric r, we use an LLM (rubric verifier) to judge whether the response satisfies each rubric ri extracted from the prompt q. As we shall see later, we observe that naively prompting an off-the-shelf LLM as the rubric verifier does not yield the best result, which motivates us to finetune an LLM to this task. i= Based on the formulation above, we describe the details of each component in our RIFL pipeline as follows. In Section 4.2, we introduce synthetic rubric generation pipeline to construct high-quality training set of prompts paired with rubrics. In Section 4.3, we develop methods to train rubric verifier to provide R(q, o, r) which outperforms prompted LLM judges. In Section 4.4, we discuss design choices of the reward signal that make RL most robust and effective."

We employed an LLM to semantically match the rubrics generated by our model with those labeled by human experts, calculating precision (the proportion of synthetic rubrics that were also labeled by humans) and recall (the proportion of human-labeled rubrics identified by the rubric generator). The fine-tuned model achieved an F1 score of 0.790, significant improvement over the starting checkpoint, which had an F1 score of 0.639."

            "content": "RIFL requires strong rubric verifier to provide reliable reward signals for RL. Therefore, rather than directly prompting an off-the-shelf LLM as the rubric verifier, we propose two-stage finetuning pipeline to train rubric verifier that can better align with expert human raters. Rubric verification data collection. We ask the vendor to annotate detailed rubric-based evaluation of the generated response to each user prompt given the proposed rubric. Specifically, annotators need to go through every rubric and decide whether it is met or not, and provide justification (i.e., chain-of-thought for the judge) for their judgment. This golden set of evaluations, referred to as Dgolden, is used to develop the rubric verifier for RL training with the following two stages. SFT Stage. We conduct supervised finetuning (SFT) to cold-start the model to evaluate responses based on rubrics like expert human raters. We form portion of Dgolden as the SFT dataset DSFT = {(xj, yj)}n , j=1 where xj is the rubric verifier prompt including the user prompt, rubric, and model-generated response, and yj is the human-annotated rubric-based evaluation. An example of rubric verification data is shown in Figure 3. RL Stage. After SFT, we conduct second RL stage on broader set of rubric verifier prompts to improve our rubric verifiers generalization. During rollout, the verifier checks each criterion separately with justification for the judgment (i.e., chain-of-thought reasoning) and obtains the binary judgment, and compares this judgment with the human experts binary label YES for this criteria check passed or NO if otherwise. The reward is calculated based on how closely the verifiers judgment matches the experts judgment, measured as the ratio of agreement between the two. Note that this is an RLVR problem as the verifier outputs are binary signals, which we can easily match with the golden labels. The RL process is illustrated in Figure 4. 7 Expert-created Rubric 1. Does the response recommend 58 hikes in the Ozarks? 2. Is the response formatted in sections with the trail name in bolded, italicized, and underlined header? 3.

Is the length of time for each hike included at the end of each section? 6. Is the time in the format Xhrs Xmins? 7. Are the Bell Mountain Wilderness Loop and Devils Den Trail sections from the previous turn replaced with sections on different trails? (a) Expert-created rubric.

SFT/RL Ratio. We have about 5k prompts in SFT and about 14k prompts in RL stage. Figure 4 RL of rubric verifier training in Section 4.3. The reward is computed as the ratio of agreement between the verified results and expert labels across each criterion. Rubric Verifier Evaluation. To evaluate how well the rubric verifier aligns with human judgment, we collect holdout validation set of our rubric verifier training data in Section 4.3, which has human labels about whether each response satisfies each rubric of prompt. We then compare the agreement between the human labels and the labels predicted by both the finetuned rubric verifier and the vanilla prompted LLM judge (Llama 4 Maverick), which share the same prompt template as in Section 3.1. We report the human agreement in terms of the average F1 score for this validation set in Table 4. We also include the result of o3-mini, which is strong reasoning model used in AdvancedIF as reference. We can see that the finetuned rubric verifier achieves significantly higher human agreement (0.728) than the vanilla LLM judge (0.515), and is on par with O3-mini (0.723). Specifically, the SFT stage can increase the performance from 0.515 to 0.656, and RL can further increase the accuracy. This demonstrates that both SFT and RL are required to effectively enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding and applying rubrics to evaluate responses."

In this paper, we use the most straightforward reward R(q, o, r) = [V (q, o, r) = 1] as the final reward for rubric-based RL for its simplicity and effectiveness, and provide preliminary ablation study in Section 5.4. We leave other reward computation methods (for instance, weighted sum of vi) for future work. Reward Hacking Prevention. During the early stage of experiments, we observed some reward-hacking issues during training. For instance, the model will generate some artifacts like all instructions are followed or this is perfect response that meets all requirements! in responses to mislead the rubric verifier to give spurious high reward. While finetuning rubric verifier can help to mitigate this issue (Section 4.3), we further include two additional criteria into each data point as reward shaping technique: Did the model provide clean response without any weird artifacts such as very verbose self-evaluation? Did the model provide complete response so that the last sentence of the response is not cut off? These criteria explicitly ask the rubric verifier to examine whether potential reward hacking exists and fully address this issue in our experiments."

We evaluate the performance of RIFL and the baseline on three challenging IF benchmarks, including our proposed AdvancedIF benchmark (Section 3.1) and two public benchmarks: IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023) and MultiChallenge (Deshpande et al., 2025) to test both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Specifically, IFEval is single-turn IF benchmark with verifiable instructions, and MultiChallenge is multi-turn IF benchmark with diverse instructions and instance-level rubrics. For AdvancedIF and MultiChallenge, we choose o3-mini as our rubric verifier as the same as in benchmarking SOTA models in Section 3.1. Following prior work (Zhou et al., 2023), we report the average performance of IFEval in terms of the percentage of responses that satisfy the instructions under both loose and strict evaluation settings. For MultiChallenge, we report the average score across all instances as the final performance. For AdvancedIF, we 9 Table 5 Rubric-based RL experiments: key results.

We can see that RIFL significantly outperforms the Llama 4 Maverick model by large margin across all benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of RIFL in improving the instruction-following ability of LLMs. Specifically, RIFL achieves around 59% absolute improvement on each category of AdvancedIF, leading to an overall improvement of 6.7%. On MultiChallenge, RIFL improves the score by 2.9%. On IFEval, which is already saturated by frontier models, RIFL also slightly improves the performance. These results show that RIFL can effectively enhance the models ability to follow complex instructions, handle multi-turn conversations, and adapt to different system prompts."

We also propose rubric-based RL pipeline RIFL, which first generates rubrics for complex instructions, then trains rubric verifier to provide feedback, and finally optimizes the LLM with RL. Our experiments show that RIFL significantly improves the IF ability of LLMs. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component in our pipeline. Our work demonstrates the potential of using rubrics as powerful tool for training and evaluating LLMs, and opens up new avenues for future research in this direction. We hope our work can inspire more research on improving the instruction-following ability of LLMs, and contribute to the development of more capable and reliable AI systems."
