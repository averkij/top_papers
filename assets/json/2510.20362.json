            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Contemporary data-driven materials design heavily relies on high-fidelity datasets in machine-readable formats, as the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies hinges on structured and computationally accessible data containing, at minimum, material compositions and their corresponding physical properties. Over the past decade and half, the establishment of computational databases of high-throughput screened materials based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, such as the Materials Project (MP), 1 JARVIS-DFT, 2 and Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), 3 together with experimental datasets like the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) 4 or High Throughput Experimental Materials (HTEM) database, 5 has shifted research emphasis toward data-driven materials design. Nevertheless, the preponderance of experimental scientific knowledge regarding solid-state materials, analogous to other domains, remains embedded within millions of scientific journal articles. Extracting this wealth of information into the structured, machine-readable formats required for computational analysis presents significant challenge that necessitates automated approaches. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have demonstrated remarkable advances in materials science applications, from building toolkits and techniques for automated extraction of chemical information from the scientific literature, such as ChemDataExtractor, 6, 7 ChemicalTagger, 8 BatteryBERT, 9 and others. These tools and techniques have been implemented to systematically structure the vast corpus of textual knowledge in the field 918 leveraging various techniques, including regular expressions, 19 BiLSTM recurrent neural networks, 20 and smaller transformer-based language models like BERT. 21 These approaches have successfully facilitated the extraction of entity information from diverse sources, including battery materials literature 9,12 and chemical synthesis parameters documented in methodology sections of scientific papers. 11 Entity extraction, and in particular named entity recognition (NER), has dominated these research efforts. Researchers have applied domain-specific labels such as material or property to specific textual elements, but require an additional post-processing step to construct the relations between these entities, relations that prove essential for training effective machine learning or deep learning models. To exemplify, discrete entities such as Cu2O or 2.1 eV were targeted rather than establishing the relational connections between them (for example, 2.1 eV represents the measurement of the band gap for Cu2O), i.e., they do not implement relation extraction (RE) techniques. In the early 2020s, several end-to-end methods were developed that use single machine learning model integrating both named entity recognition and relation extraction (NERRE). 2224 These methodologies demonstrate efficacy in relation extraction tasks; however, they remain fundamentally limited to n-ary relation extraction frameworks that are complex in architectural structure and struggle to extract all information if the interconnection between various entities are too high. Following the widespread adoption of various large language models (LLMs), researchers have employed them successfully to extract information from journal articles, replacing traditional sequence-to-sequence approaches with more sophisticated NERRE methods. Approaches ranging from pre-training 25 and fine-tuning LLMs 2631 to prompt-engineering, 27,3035 zero-shot 27,28,30,31,36 and few-shot prompting, 27,31,35,36 as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods 37,38 have enhanced NERRE-level text extraction from materials science literature. Concurrently, LLM-powered agents have been utilised for various chemistry and material science tasks, including extracting relevant informa3 tion from journal articles, 3943 predicting new molecules or materials or their properties, 31,39 automating data handling, 31,41,4345 enhancing reasoning and computational capabilities of LLMs, 39,41,42,44,45 proposing novel hypotheses, 31 and even semi-automating experiments 45 by integrating expert tools. Several notable implementations have emerged in this domain, such as Eunomia by Ansari et al., 40 an AI agent chemist for developing materials datasets by accessing computational databases and research papers, and, very recently the multi-agent system nanoMINER, 46 which combines LLMs and multimodal analysis to extract information, though it is specifically limited to nanomaterials. However, both Eunomia and nanoMINER lack the capability to integrate Text and Data Mining (TDM) API keys1 through the package, requiring users to provide the articles in PDF format by manually downloading them, which represents labour-intensive and time-consuming process when dealing with large-scale datasets. Additionally,enumerating all explicit chemical formulas from variable compositions (e.g., Pb1xKxNb2O6 where x=0.1, 0.2 etc.) into distinct compounds remains beyond the scope of these agentic systems. Recently, Wilhelmi et al. published comprehensive tutorial on using LLMs to extract chemical data as structured output via various methods, including prompting, RAG and agentic systems. 47 Nevertheless, an easily configurable automated workflow that enables end users to build, evaluate, and visualise datasets through information extraction from journal articles has been lacking. In this work, we present an autonomous multi-agent agile framework, ComProScanner, for end users to extract, evaluate, categorise and visualise machine-readable structured chemical compositions and properties, combined with synthesis information from journal articles to create extensive databases. When research article contains chemical composition along with the enquired property value, the framework extracts structured JSON data 48 containing both agent-extracted relevant information and journal article metadata obtained via APIs. The agent-extracted relevant information comprises the chemical composition 1TDM agreements differ from standard academic subscriptions granted to institutional libraries, as they specifically govern the scraping and downloading of large volumes of content, which could potentially impact the operational performance of publishers servers. 4 of the material and the property value as key-value pairs, property unit, material family, synthesis method, precursors used, brief synthesis steps, and characterisation techniques employed. Our system combines LLM agents with powerful tools, including RAG and custom deep learning model for extracting chemical compositions and properties only when property values are available in articles. The workflow supports Elsevier, Springer Nature, IOP Publishing, and Wiley articles via publishers TDM APIs or PDFs from local folders. ComProScanner enhances text-mining accuracy by providing flexible contextual parameters to agents while maintaining cost-effectiveness through preliminary article filtering via keyword matching. The system supports multiple configurable LLMs for both extraction agents and RAG implementations. ComProScanner can be implemented with fewer than 20 lines of Python code to extract pre-defined structured data, provided that users have access to the TDM APIs of the publishers. We evaluated the extraction performance of ten LLMs using 100 articles containing piezoelectric coefficient d33 values, achieving overall accuracy exceeding 80% across various models. Detailed evaluation methods and metrics are presented in the Results and Discussion sections. Additionally, we conducted cost versus accuracy comparisons to help users identify economically suitable LLMs to build datasets without performing their own evaluations."

The system implements preliminary keyword-based filtration for the entire text of the article through Python regular expressions (Python RegEx) 19 to identify relevant articles mentioning the property, thereby optimising data management by avoiding text extraction from irrelevant sources that would unnecessarily inflate the database size. Articles in which the required property is mentioned are organised and stored in CSV format with dedicated columns corresponding to specific article sections (abstract, introduction, experimental methods, computational methods, results and discussion, and conclusion), with optional MySQL database 51 integration. Vector databases are generated, along with CSV files, using the open-source ChromaDB 52 package when any of the specified relevant keywords are detected within an article, facilitating future RAG queries."

            "content": "The information extraction phase represented in detail in Figure 2, incorporates five specialised AI agents (Figure 2), beginning with property identifier (the Materials Data identifier) that utilises RAG technology under the RAG Crew. This initial filtering significantly reduces API costs (or computational resource usage for locally hosted LLMs) by eliminating articles that merely mention the required property without containing actual property values. The four remaining agents are organised into two functional subgroups: one dedicated to extracting composition-related data (the Composition Crew Set) and another focused on collecting synthesis information (the Synthesis Crew Set). Each subgroup employs two sequentially ordered agents; the first extracts raw data, while the second formats it. By default, the package uses the provided keyword with some pre-set rules and instruction for 7 Figure 2: Comprehensive workflow diagram of the CrewAI-based extraction system in ComProScanner, comprising five specialised agents. The process begins with property identifier agent ((a) RAG Crew) that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to filter relevant articles.

The workflow integrates two essential tools: RAGTool for discriminating between mere property mentions and actual quantitative property values, and MaterialParserTool for accurate processing of complex chemical formulations. 8 the agents. However, Notes can be appended to both agents and tasks across all five agent components to provide supplementary instructions to the agents as additional context. For complex compositions with multiple fractions denoted as variables e.g., Na(1x)LixTiO3 where x=0.1, 0.3, 0.4, the system employs material-parsers, deep learning model developed by Foppiano et al., 18 as an agent tool that resolves the example into three distinct compositions: Na(0.9)Li(0.1)TiO3, Na(0.7)Li(0.3)TiO3, and Na(0.6)Li(0.4)TiO3. All extracted data are compiled into unified JSON format, which is subsequently integrated with the corresponding article metadataii. Evaluation, Post-processing, and Dataset Creation The total extracted JSON data comprise two main segments: (i) agent-extracted compositionproperty and synthesis data, (ii) journal article metadata. detailed description of each type of agent-extracted data can be found in section S2 of the ESI along with an example of complete extracted JSON data (Figure S1). ComProScanner offers built-in comprehensive evaluation framework, both agent-based and semantic-based, designed to assess and visualise the extraction performance of LLM agents with scientific rigour. The framework implements three distinct categories of evaluation metrics: (a) custom weight-based accuracy metrics, (b) conventional classification metrics, and (c) normalised classification metrics. The custom weight-based accuracy enables users to assign differential priority values to specific extracted parameters; for instance, users can allocate greater emphasis to composition-property keyvalue pairs (weight of 0.3) compared to synthesis steps (weight of 0.1) [see section S2 in the ESI for all possible extracted parameters and their weight-based emphasis], where the total weight for all extracted parameters is 1. If the weight for one parameter (e.g., compositioniiThis new article metadata is collected for each specific article containing agent-extracted information, differing from the previously collected metadata that contained limited information for all related articles associated with the property keyword used for metadata collection. This new comprehensive metadata includes wide range of information: DOI, article title, journal name, year of publication, open access information, author list with their institutional details, and article keywords. These data are obtained either via Elseviers ScienceDirect Article Metadata API 53 (optional) or the Open Access Buttons free metadata API 54 developed by OA.Works 9 property) is set to 1, keeping all other parameters 0, the accuracy will be determined purely by the composition-property extraction performance. Standard classification metrics include Precision, Recall and F1-score, which are defined relative to the concepts of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). True positive can be defined as correct value extracted by the agent, false positive when the extracted value does not match the ground truth (the actual text to be extracted), and false negative as value that is expected but has not been extracted by the agent. Both Precision and Recall can be represented as: Precision = P + , Recall = P + From Precision and Recall, another metric, F1, can be calculated using Equation 2, F1 = 2 Precision Recall Precision + Recall (1) (2) Beyond standard classification metrics calculated using the aggregate number of items across all evaluation articles, we have developed normalised classification metrics that consider each article as single evaluative unit, wherein each extracted item within an article contributes fractional importance to that articles overall evaluation score. These normalised evaluation metrics were specifically designed to ensure an equitable comparison between articles with significant disparities in the quantity of extractable information. The normalised metrics for all papers are calculated using the modified Precision, Recall and F1-score, Normalised Precision = (cid:80)N i=1( )ni Pi Pi+F Pi Normalised Recall = (cid:80)N i=1( )ni Pi Pi+F Ni Normalised F1 = 2 Normalised Precision Normalised Recall Normalised Precision + Normalised Recall (3) (4) (5) 10 where, Pi, Pi, Ni = true positives, false positives, false negatives for paper i, ni = total number of items in paper i, and = total number of papers. Weight-based accuracy metrics, classification metrics and normalised classification metrics all provide the flexibility to use both semantic and agentic approaches for evaluation. The semantic similarity method is used to match ground truth and ComProScanner-extracted information for the semantic approach, whereas LLM agents are instructed to match the ground truth and ComProScanner-extracted information for the agentic approach. Although the evaluation accuracy is expected to be higher for the agentic approach, given that LLM agents will have better comparison ability than semantic comparison between two sentences, the agentic evaluation can take more time and require significantly large numbers of tokens if reasoning models are used for better performance. ComProScanner provides extensive visualisation capabilities of the evaluation through diverse array of graphical representations, including bar charts, radar plots, heat maps, histograms, and violin charts, all readily accessible within the framework. Additionally, the system offers pie charts and histogram plotting functionalities to facilitate the analysis of data distribution across composition families, precursors, and characterisation techniques."

            "content": "Although the Materials Project 1 contains the largest database of piezoelectric materials, 56 approximately 700 materials therein have non-zero d33 coefficients, which quantify the electric field generated when piezoelectric material is subjected to applied strain. More critically, fewer than 50 materials are present in the database with d33 values exceeding 10 pC/N, where the highest value reaches up to 738.47 pC/N. However, tens of thousands of previous works, predominantly experimental, have been already conducted to identify materials with larger d33 coefficients through doping or other methods, yet these findings remain in the literature in unstructured, non-machine readable formats. Thus, considering the challenge of 11 extracting composition-property relationships from unstructured literature data as one of the most significant tests for assessing ComProScanners ability, along with synthesis data, we evaluated ceramic piezoelectric materials and their corresponding piezoelectric d33 coefficient values, across ten different LLMs. Metadata of articles related to piezoelectric materials were collected based on piezoelectric, piezoelectricity, pyroelectric, pyroelectricity, ferroelectric, and ferroelectricity as the main base keywords. After collecting metadata with only base queries, combinations of base queries and 18 additional keywords such as, advancements, applications, ceramics, characterization, composites, crystals, etc., were used to collect larger set of metadata that could contain potential piezoelectric materials along with their corresponding d33 coefficient values. The complete list of the additional keywords can be found in the supporting information 57 (see the test example.py script). Although metadata were collected for all articles published between 1st of January 2019 and 17th of March 2025, only Elsevier papers were considered for the evaluation process, where only 3,916 papers mentioned d33, accounting for potential differences in formatting. Subsequently, 100 test DOIs were selected, based on the presence of the compositionproperty data using the RAG agent, whilst randomising the metadata order. For RAG and other NLP tasks, text embedding plays crucial part in ensuring the efficiency of the models. The PhysBERT 58 model has demonstrated superior accuracy compared to various sentence transformer and BERT models in identifying various physics and materials science specific vocabulary. However, to ensure that PhysBERT would perform better than the leading sentence transformer model, all-mpnet-base-v2, 59 in our specific domain, the thellert/physbert cased model from Hugging Face was evaluated against sentence-transformers all-mpnet-base-v2 model using 12 domain-specific synonyms based on abbreviated forms or chemical formulae and their corresponding full names or trivial names, which are summarised in Table S1 in the ESI. The PhysBERT model outperformed all-mpnet-base-v2 in all cases, with remarkable performance differences ranging from highly significant improvements for 12 terms such as DOS (density of states) with cosine similarityiii difference of 0.8338, to modest improvements for common terms such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) with difference of 0.0566. This satisfactory performance of PhysBERT encouraged us to adopt this model as the default embedding model for storing article text data in the ChromaDB vector database for use in the RAG tool illustrated in Figure 2. For fair evaluation across various models, the RAG environment was maintained consistently, as described in detail in section S3 of the ESI. Finally, extraction agents were used to extract information for the piezoelectric materials only for the test DOIs. We selected LLMs to enable comparison between open-source models (Googles Gemma-3-27B-Instruct, 60 DeepSeeks DeepSeek-V3-0324, 61 Metas Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, Llama-4-Maverick-17B-Instruct, 62,63 and Alibabas Qwen3-235-A22B, 64 Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct 65) and proprietary models (Googles Gemini-2.0-Flash, 66 Gemini-2.5Flash-Preview, 67 and OpenAIs GPT-4o-mini, 68 GPT-4.1-nano) 69) at similar price points, after analysing the cost-versus-accuracy ratio from the Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard, 70 where models had Arena scores exceeding 1250 and output costs below $1/1M tokens (for more details, see section S4 in the ESI). Additional instructions were passed to the agents for better extraction performance specific to piezoelectric materials and d33 coefficients (see the test example.py script from supporting information 57). The normalised classification metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) of different models, as described in the Evaluation, Post-processing, and Dataset Creation sub-section above, for both semantic and agentic approaches, are represented as grouped bar charts for the model Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (the best-performing model when considering only normalised metrics) in Figure 3. Semantic and agentic comparisons based on normalised metrics for all other models can be found in section S5 of the ESI. We used PhysBERT model for semantic evaluation, the Gemini-2.5-Pro reasoning model 67 has been employed for agentic evaluation. Although normalised classification metrics for both semantic and agentic evaluation show iiiCosine similarity measures how similar two text embeddings (vectors) are by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. This provides score between -1 (completely dissimilar) and 1 (identical), which is useful for tasks such as text or document clustering. 13 Figure 3: Normalised classification metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) for model Llama3.3-70B-Instruct (best performing model considering only normalised metrics) to showcase the performance of ComProScanners performance capability for the considered models using: semantic evaluation through the PhysBERT model (red bars), and agentic evaluation through the Gemini-2.5-Pro reasoning model (blue bars). similar trends, the agentic evaluation demonstrates superior performance accuracy compared to semantic evaluation, which is understandable given that reasoning models such as Gemini2.5-Pro possess greater capability to compare sentence structures with equivalent meanings. Given the superior accuracy demonstrated by agentic evaluation, we focus on these results to identify the best-performing models for practical implementation. As mentioned earlier, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct outperforms all other models in normalised classification metrics with Precision value of 0.80, Recall value of 0.81, and F1-score of 0.80 (Figure 3). The confusion matrix (Figure 4) reveals distinct performance patterns across the evaluated models for piezoelectric materials extraction taking into account all performance metrics. DeepSeek-V3-0324 emerged as the top-performing model for data extraction, demonstrating 14 Figure 4: Confusion matrix from agentic evaluation, showcasing all 9 evaluation parameters, such as weight-based overall accuracy (average of composition accuracy and synthesis accuracy), weight-based composition accuracy and weight-based synthesis accuracy, classification metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score), and normalised classification metrics (normalised Precision, normalised Recall, and normalised F1-score), across 10 different LLMs used in this study. consistently high scores across all metrics, with particularly strong performance in composition accuracy (0.90), Precision (0.84), Recall (0.83), and F1-score (0.84). This model showed balanced performance with an overall accuracy of 0.82 and robust synthesis accuracy of 0.75. The Qwen model family demonstrated competitive performance, with both Qwen3235B-A22B and Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct achieving comparable results. Notably, both models 15 excelled in composition accuracy (0.89-0.90) and maintained consistent performance across Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics (0.79-0.85). Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct showed strong overall performance with an accuracy of 0.76 and exceptional composition accuracy (0.87). Googles Gemini models presented mixed results. While Gemini-2.0-Flash achieved moderate performance with balanced metrics, Gemini-2.5-Flash-Preview unexpectedly underperformed compared to its predecessor, showing lower scores across most metrics (0.61-0.71). Llama-4Maverick-17B-Instruct demonstrated notable strengths in specific areas despite its overall lower performance, achieving commendable composition accuracy (0.83) and Precision (0.78). However, the model struggled significantly with synthesis accuracy (0.55) and normalised Precision (0.63). The most concerning performance was observed with GPT-4.1-Nano, which consistently scored lowest across all metrics, particularly struggling with normalised Precision (0.46). Similarly, Gemma-3-27B-Instruct showed suboptimal performance, with notable weaknesses in synthesis accuracy and normalised Precision. Furthermore, to compare ComProScanners variable parsing ability with the original material-parsers tool developed by Foppiano et al., 18 we tested several examples from the test dataset by processing them directly through material-parsers, with results summarised in Table 1. Whilst ComProScanner outperformed material-parsers in most cases (first three examples), both tools successfully resolved the chemical formulae for relatively straightforward compositions (fourth example), and both occasionally failed, as demonstrated in the fifth example. Throughout the entire test set, ComProScanner demonstrated superior performance in most instances and equivalent performance in others when compared to material-parsers, thereby validating ComProScanners capabilities. 16 Figure 5: Distribution of various data types across the evaluated 100 articles: (a) piezoelectric material families, (b) synthesis precursors, and (c) characterisation techniques. Similarity thresholds of 0.8 were applied for families and precursors, whilst 0.78 was used for characterisation techniques to group semantically similar items.

Ca0.95Tm0.05Bi2Nb2O9 ComProScanner also offers built-in data distribution visualisation functions to represent various material families, synthesis precursors, and characterisation techniques as either histograms or pie-charts through semantic clustering mechanism. Figure 5 shows these data distributions, where similarity thresholds of 0.8 (default in ComProScanner) were applied for material families and precursors, while 0.78 was found to be best for characterisation techniques during semantic clustering. The resulting distributions reveal the prevalence of different components in piezoelectric materials research across the evaluated 100 articles. In terms of material families, BaTiO3 dominates at 39.0%, followed by KNN (16.0%) and PZT (14.0%), with various other compositions including CaBi2Nb2O9 (9.0%) and BNTbased materials (3.0%) comprising the remainder. For synthesis precursors, Bi2O3 is most frequently used (18.9%), followed by Na2CO3 (13.3%) and TiO2 (10.2%), with diverse range of other precursors including various carbonates, oxides, and acids distributed across smaller percentages. The characterisation techniques show XRD as the predominant method (33.1%), which is expected for crystalline phase analysis, followed by impedance analysers (21.9%) for electrical property measurements, and ferroelectric test systems (8.3%) for specific piezoelectric characterisation, with various other analytical techniques contributing to comprehensive materials evaluation. To visualise the relationships between the distribution of all data types mentioned in the Methods section for the evaluated dataset, knowledge graph visualisation offered by the neo4j 71 library has been employed within the ComProScanner package (Figure 6). The produced neo4j knowledge graph from 100 test articles contains total of 1,825 graph nodes, which are summarised in Table S2 of the ESI. Cypher 72 queries can be utilised to retrieve relational information for specific nodes, for example, the inset of Figure 6 represents 10 random items among 79 compositions associated with BaTiO3 family across 100 test articles. Detailed information about all nodes associated with the test data can be found in Table S2 in the ESI."

            "content": "Although d33 was mentioned in 3,916 papers published within the considered time period, only data from the 100 test papers were extracted for evaluation, as our aim here is to introduce the robust data-extraction framework rather than providing dataset. However, with this limited dataset of 100 test samples, we identified piezoelectric composition Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 achieving 2090 pC/N, which demonstrates Figure 6: Generated neo4j knowledge graph from both composition-property, and synthesis data as well as metadata information extracted from 100 articles using the ComProScanner package. The inset shows 10 randomly chosen items from the 79 compositions associated with BaTiO3 family node using cypher query. the significance of this framework. On top of this, over 99% of the extracted piezoelectric materials are not in the Materials Project piezoelectric database, which emphasises the importance of ComProScanner for creating datasets from materials information buried within the materials science literature. When using ComProScanner to extract data for use case different to the piezoelectric materials described here, substituting the piezoelectric material and d33 coefficient-related keywords with ones own choice of property keywords in the additional information maybe sufficient; however, one may need to introduce further prompt engineering for better extraction performance. During evaluation with ones own data, despite being superior in evaluation, the agentic approach can result in substantial costs, as the pricing of reasoning models is considerably higher than that of chat models. In such cases, to determine the suitable model for data extraction, semantic evaluation can serve as cost-efficient approach. For the piezoelectric materials considered, balanced performance in each metric with an overall accuracy of 0.82 indicates that DeepSeek-v3-0324 possesses the most reliable extraction capabilities for complex piezoelectric material data. The consistency in various metrics for both Qwen models suggests these models are also well-suited for systematic materials data extraction tasks. Llama-3.3-70B-Instructs results makes it particularly valuable for applications requiring high Precision in materials identification. However, its synthesis accuracy (0.65) is relatively lower, indicating potential challenges in extracting complex synthesis information. The counter-intuitive results from two Gemini models suggests that model updates do not always guarantee improved performance for domain-specific tasks. The results for Llama-4-Maverick-17B-Instruct suggest it may be more suitable for compositionfocused extraction tasks rather than comprehensive materials informatics applications. Poor performances from GPT-4.1-Nano and Gemma-3-27B-Instruct highlight the importance of model selection for materials informatics applications, where domain-specific performance can vary significantly from general language tasks. The comparison between the original materialparsers tool and ComProScanner demonstrates that our package performs significantly more efficiently than material-parsers when resolving complex chemical compositions containing variables. Though LLM agents attempt to ensure consistent results across runs, the underlying LLMs are nondeterministic by nature, which forms the core limitation of any type of LLM-based approach; consequently, results may vary slightly between runs. For the Materials Data identifier agent, the RAG question, chunk size, chunk overlap, top value, and RAG chat model may require adjustment and testing according to the specific use case. Although manual evaluation would serve as the optimal evaluation technique compared to semantic and agentic approaches, it is not practical for large dataset evaluation. With this consideration, semantic and agentic approaches are incorporated into the framework, and depending on the 23 chosen reasoning model, evaluation results can vary slightly. ComProScanner establishes the essential foundation for the next generation of AI in material science, creating pathway to develop extensive text-mined datasets from journal articles. The framework we have developed enables seamless, user-friendly automated data extraction pipeline. However, OCR technology or VLMs could be integrated with the framework in the future to extract information from graphs or other image formats. Additionally, flexibility to modify the structure of the extracted JSON data could be incorporated into the framework to extract multiple material properties."

            "content": "Although researchers have attempted to automate the extraction of structured information from journal articles, user-friendly, ready-to-use framework was lacking. Here, we have introduced multi-agent framework, ComProScanner to accomplish this task. We assessed our framework using 100 scientific articles across 10 LLMs for highly complex ceramic piezoelectric material compositions and corresponding d33 coefficient values. We found ComProScanner could extract extremely complex piezoelectric material compositions with the optimal settings with DeepSeek-V3-0324 achieving an overall accuracy of 0.82 and compositional accuracy of 0.90. Both considered Qwen models (Qwen3-235B-A22B and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct also demonstrated competitive performance with an average composition-property accuracy ranging from 0.87-0.90. Surprisingly Gemini2.5-Flash-Preview underperformed compared to its predecessor in most of the evaluation metrics. Correct assessment of these complex textual data is challenging, and must be performed manually which is practically impossible for extensive datasets. However, both semantic and agentic evaluation suggest the potential application of ComProScanner for creating vast datasets of complex material compositions and associated properties, along with synthesis information. As demonstrated by ComProScanners performance, LLM-based multiagent frameworks represent promising approach for automated scientific data extraction, potentially accelerating materials discovery and database construction for data-driven research."
