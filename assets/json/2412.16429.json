Introduction Our initial tech report [1] from May 2024 surveyed the history and current landscape of education technology, discussed the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) on education, and presented our collaborative approach to developing evaluations. Following its publication, we received input from across the international education sector, including schools, educational technology (EdTech) companies, non-profit organizations, and government agencies eager to try our models or otherwise collaborate. Through review of these submissions, over 20 follow-up interviews, and input from Google product teams building gen AI powered learning features, we can summarize the key findings as follows: 1. Pedagogy1, or rather, ideal behavior of an AI tutor, is prohibitively difficult to define given the wide range of grade-levels, subjects, languages, cultures, product designs, and philosophies that must be accommodated. While there are many commonalities, appropriate behavior in different contexts may be different or even contradictory, and it is best left to the developer or teacher to specify. 2. In developing AI learning systems, the most commonly cited, immediately useful behavior in an underlying model is the ability to follow system instructions to create interactive tutor-led exercises. Teachers or developers who specify these instructions want to feel confident that the AI tutor will follow the specified instructions accurately, even if student tries to circumvent them (e.g., do not give away the answer or stay on topic). 3. Post-hoc fine-tuning for each application can be effective in the short-term, but is impractical because of cost, maintenance, and rapidly improving base models. Thus, despite its shortcomings, prompting will likely remain the best way for education product developers to specify behavior."

[ 1 9 2 4 6 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Figure 1 An overview of our three-stage human evaluation pipeline and our results for comparing LearnLM with other systems. (1) Learning scenarios are developed that allow raters to role-play specific learners interacting with pairs of AI tutors (2). Grounding material (e.g. an essay, homework problem, diagram, etc.) and System Instructions specific to each scenario are passed as context to each model. The resulting conversation pairs are reviewed by pedagogy experts (3) who answer range of questions assessing each model on its own as well as their comparative performance. These comparative ratings (on seven-point -3 to +3 Likert scale) are aggregated (4) to show overall preference for LearnLM over GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 Pro. See Section 4 for more detailed results. of these observations. Specifically, we cast our work as pedagogical instruction following, meaning that we contextualize training and evaluation examples with system-level instructions that describe desired pedagogical behavior. This approach avoids any narrow specification of how systems should behave, and allows us to effectively add pedagogical data to the rest of Geminis training mixture without conflicts of persona or style. We also include Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [2] in our training procedure to allow models to follow more nuanced pedagogical instructions and preferences. Using the updated methodology, we trained new version of LearnLM, which is based on Gemini 1.5 Pro2 [3]. In our evaluations against contemporaneous flagship models, each representing companys premier offering as of 2024-10-01, expert pedagogical raters preferred LearnLM with an average preference strength of 31% over GPT-4o, 11% over Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and 13% over the original Gemini 1.5 Pro (see Figure 1). LearnLM is available as an experimental model on Google AI Studio along with documentation of example use cases and suggested prompts. We welcome any feedback, which will help inform our future research and prioritization. As we improve LearnLM for teaching and learning, we are also working to bring these advances into Gemini models, so any developers using Gemini can benefit from the improvements made via LearnLM research. Section 2 describes how we trained LearnLM for pedagogical instruction following and Section 3 explains how we updated our scenario-based evaluation design accordingly. Section 4 shows detailed analysis of results comparing LearnLM with other premier model offerings. Finally, Section 5 outlines some future work, especially with regards to continued evaluation. Training and evaluation 2Specifically gemini-1.5-pro-002 (release notes). 2 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning of LearnLM is done across broad range of core academic subjects, and we include feasibility study on medical education subjects in Appendix C. 2. Modeling In our original tech report [1], we adapted the behavior of base model by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with range of synthetic and human-written datasets. Since then, we have made number of substantial changes to our training strategy: First, we updated our SFT data according to our focus on pedagogical instruction following. Second, we decided to additionally leverage Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)[2], for which we collected human preference data to train Reward Models (RMs) and prompts for the RL stage. Third, rather than running our own post-training after Geminis standard post-training, we co-train with Gemini, meaning we mix our data directly with Geminis SFT, RM, and RL stages. LearnLM is the result of this experimental mixture and we have also been integrating our data and evaluations into the main Gemini models; subset of LearnLM improvements is part of the recently released Gemini 2.0 models [4]. 2.1. Pedagogical instruction following Instruction following (IF) refers to models ability to follow prompts, usually to better align with human intents [5]. Gemini [3] differentiates between User Instructions, inserted by user during conversation, and System Instructions, typically specified by developer ahead of any user interaction, which take precedence over any subsequent instructions provided by the user. System Instructions can vary greatly in complexity, from single minimally specified sentence like You are knowledgeable writing coach, to specific conditional expectations, e.g. If the user has answered 3 questions correctly, move to the next topic, to detailed, multi-paragraph instructions that describe complex tasks and behaviors, exemplified by the education prompts in Mollick and Mollick [6], or the recently proposed Complex IF benchmark [7]. Instructions broadly fall into two categories: hard constraints, often used for length, formatting, or content requirements (e.g. summarize the text in less than 100 words or do not use word X), and soft, more nuanced constraints or guidelines, often used to control style, persona, or tone (e.g. use professional voice or use language that is easier to understand for non-native speaker). Among open-source IF benchmarks, IFEval [8] focuses on programmatically verifiable IF, subset of hard constraints, with more recent benchmarks like Qin et al. [9] expanding the scope to include more nuanced linguistic and stylistic guidelines. For educational use cases, both categories of instructions are important, e.g. do not reveal the answer is hard constraint, while use motivating tone is soft one. Improvements on IF capabilities have already resulted in better model responses for many learning use cases. In this work, we build on this progress and focus on improving instruction following for pedagogical System Instructions, which tend to be more complex, nuanced and not easily verifiable; these attributes make them more difficult for models to follow. 2.2. Post-training and data collection strategy Our primary modeling strategy is to collect data that improves the models ability to follow pedagogical System Instructions that we observed were common for developers building AI tutors. Accordingly, we updated our SFT data so that each conversation begins with different System Instruction that specifically describes the pedagogical behavior present in that conversation. More general or vague instructions are counterproductive because the model learns to ignore instructions that are not useful 3 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning for predicting the target model turns. To collect human preference data, we similarly seed each conversation with different pedagogicallyfocused System Instruction, and ask raters to label model samples based on the degree to which they adhere to those instructions. These conversations and turn-level labels are used to train reward model, which is then employed during RLHF to score samples from the policy model. While SFT seems to improve pedagogical instruction following somewhat, RL is significantly more effective, as preference judgements often contain subtle distinctions in how instructions are interpreted and followed in the context of long conversations. 2.3. Benefits of co-training Pedagogical behavior is often at odds with typical behavior of conversational AI, principally because learning is often process of discovery rather than simply transfer of information. Our instruction following approach allows us to mix pedagogical conversation data alongside data that contains more typical interactions by conditioning pedagogical model responses on specific System Instructions. By co-training with Geminis post-training mixture, we allow the model to learn new kinds of instruction following without forgetting other core reasoning, multimodal understanding, factuality, safety, or multi-turn properties. Moving forward, we can also more easily keep LearnLM in sync with Gemini as the training recipe evolves. 3. Human Evaluation Design In our initial tech report we discussed taxonomy of pedagogy evaluation designs, and reported results of four human evaluations with different methodologies (Sections 4 and 5 in Jurenka et al. [1]). Here, we focus on scenario-guided, conversation-level pedagogy evaluations and side-by-side comparisons. We improved the clarity and coverage of our learning scenarios, added System Instructions specific to each scenario, and updated the pedagogy rubric and questions. Guiding the conversations with scenarios is especially important in multi-turn settings [10]: without scenarios, the unconstrained nature of human-AI interactions frequently leads to meandering conversations, offering poor basis for comparison. In contrast, scenario-based approaches support relatively repeatable, controlled comparisons of the capabilities of different conversational AI systems. Scenario frameworks also help with evaluation coverage, ensuring that we test diverse range of use cases. Our evaluation process takes place in three stages, depicted above in Figure 1. First, we identified an ecologically representative distribution of learning use cases and created bank of 49 evaluation scenarios (Section 3.1). Second, these scenarios grounded interactions between AI systems and pool of ð = 186 pedagogy experts role-playing as learners across learning goals, subjects, learning materials, and learner personas (Section 3.2). Third, to assess the quality of pedagogy in these interactions, we separately recruited pool of ð = 248 pedagogy experts to review the performance of the systems (Section 3.3). This process produced ample quantitative and qualitative data to help us understand the systems capabilities and behavior (Section 3.4). We are committed to following best practices in research ethics, including by communicating transparently about our research aims, collecting informed consent, and compensating fairly for participation [11]. Our protocol underwent independent ethical review, with favourable opinion from the Human Behavioural Research Ethics Committee at Google DeepMind (#21 008). LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning 3.1. Scenario design An evaluation scenario is structured template that supports consistent, multi-turn evaluations of conversational AI systems. scenario specifies certain key properties about an interaction between an individual and an AI system, such as the goals, traits, and actions for the individual, as well as relevant conversational context. The scenarios that we curated ask human participants to role-play as different types of learners (e.g., students in classrooms, or independent EdTech users) across wide range of learning contexts that vary by academic discipline, learning objective, and instructional approach. We used systematic procedure to develop the bank of learning scenarios, drawing upon input from the educational ecosystem and support from pedagogy experts: Phase 1: Use-case elicitation. To begin the development of our scenario bank, we solicited feedback from EdTech companies, educational institutions, and Google product teams seeking to apply gen AI to tutoring and teaching. We asked them to share common use cases, prompts, opportunities, and challenges they saw for gen AI in real-world educational settings. We compiled and analyzed this feedback as team with the goal of identifying common themes that should inform our evaluation approach. Phase 2: Template design. Based on these use cases, opportunities, and challenges, we drafted structured scenario template (see Scenario structure and contents in Appendix B.1) and specific protocol to steer scenario generation, including set of guiding questions for each property (see Protocol for scenario generation in Appendix B.2). Phase 3: Scenario generation and refinement. We next collaboratively and iteratively populated our bank of scenarios. Members of our team, including two with many years of professional experience in education of students as well as teachers, independently drafted scenarios, leveraging the template and guiding questions from Phase 2. We collectively reviewed the scenario drafts, assessing each for clarity, completeness, correctness, and relevance to our pedagogical principles and the use cases defined in Phase 1. We weighted the overall distribution of scenarios across different learning goals, personas, and subject areas, flagging any gaps for further development. This process resulted in diverse bank of 49 scenarios across academic subjects (see Appendix B.3 for examples). 3.2. Conversation collection In the second stage, we collected corpus of conversations in which human participants role-played learners interacting with an AI system, as specified in the evaluation scenarios. To effectively simulate learner behavior in our educational scenarios, we recruited pool of ð = 168 pedagogy experts with advanced academic degrees and two or more years of experience as tutor. Every session of conversation collection began with short training on role-playing the scenarios (see Figure 2, Step 1). After passing quiz at the end of the training, participants selected scenario to enact (see Figure 2, Step 2). Conversation collection proceeded in pairs, such that the same participant enacted scenario first with one AI system, and then another (LearnLM and comparison system). We randomized the order of the systems for each conversation pair and did not label the systems for participants. Within each pair of conversations, the models received the same System Instructions, grounding material, and initial learner queries as context, as specified by our scenarios (see Figure 2, Step 3). We formatted all inputs identically, except for some small specification differences mandated by the system APIs. 5 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Figure 2 Workflow to generate conversations based on educational scenarios. participant enacts conversations with prompted models as defined by scenarios. The participant then fills out survey capturing quality and preference between models. As specified by our template, each scenario included an initial query for the learner that was automatically sent on behalf of the participant to begin the conversation. After the AI system responded to that query, the participant continued the interaction, guided by the information provided in the scenario. We required participants to continue for minimum of 10 conversational turns (thus, minimum of 5 learner and 5 system turns) before they could end the interaction, but on average, participants conversed with the models for around twice this number of turns (Figure 3). After ending each conversation (see Figure 2, Step 4), participants filled out brief questionnaire to share their experience interacting with the system (see Figure 2, Step 5 & Appendix B.4). Additionally, after each pair of conversations, participants completed another questionnaire focused on their impressions comparing the two systems (see Figure 2, Step 6 & Appendix B.5). Participants could then either select new scenario to begin two additional conversations or end the session. 3.3. Pedagogical assessment Finally, in the third stage, we recruited another pool of ð = 228 pedagogy expertsagain with advanced academic degrees and two or more years of experience as tutorto analyze these conversations and assess the pedagogical capabilities of the different AI models. Each assessment session began with short training on the goals of our evaluation and the scenario template. We randomly assigned each participant scenario to review. After review, we randomly assigned them pair of conversations from that scenario to assess (i.e., pair of conversations collected from single participant from the conversation-collection stage). Participants reviewed one conversation transcript at time. After reading transcript, participants answered questionnaire focused on the pedagogical performance of the AI system from that conversation (see Appendix B.6). After every pair of conversations, participants completed an additional brief questionnaire comparing their assessment of the two systems (see Appendix B.7). We aimed to collect three independent assessments for each pair of conversations to reduce the effects of interrater variability. LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning 3.4. Analysis We employ Bayesian statistical framework for our quantitative analyses. By directly quantifying the probability of hypotheses and providing clear, interpretable measure of uncertainty, Bayesian analysis offers practical, informative approach for evaluating AI systems intended for deployment in the real world. Our study design involves repeated measurements from our participants. That is, each participant role-playing as learner interacted with each system multiple times, and each expert assessed each system multiple times. To account for this non-independence and avoid artificially inflating our confidence in our estimates, we analyze our data with hierarchical models [12]. In addition, we conducted qualitative analysis of the open-ended comments and feedback collected from our experts after role-playing each scenario with two systems (stage 2)3. To do so, we first identified and then refined general themes related to the learner-system interactions from participants free-form responses. We then coded individual responses for the presence or absence of each theme. To avoid biasing our annotations, we censored the identities of the systems during this process. See Appendix B.8 for the codebook that we developed through our analysis. 4. Results We compared LearnLM against contemporaneous flagship offerings (as of 2024-10-01), in particular GPT-4o4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet5, along with Gemini 1.5 Pro6, which we adapted to train LearnLM. Since our evaluation process began, all these models have been updated and improved and new versions have been released. Therefore, our results only reflect reasonably fair comparison at specific moment; still, we hope that our continued investment in education maintains or increases relative preference for our models. In total, we collected set of 2360 conversations, consisting of 58 459 total learner and model messages. We collected 10 192 expert assessments of those conversations, with an average of three experts reviewing each pair of conversations. Figure 3 shows that the systems we evaluate demonstrate notably different response length distributions across the collected conversations, including between Gemini 1.5 Pro and LearnLM, but there is no clear relationship between length and perceived quality as seen in other model comparisons [13]. We review evaluation results as follows: first, comparative preference ratings between systems from evaluation stage 3, second, non-comparative ratings from evaluation stage 3, third, non-comparative ratings after role-playing learners in evaluation stage 2, and fourth, analysis of open-ended feedback from evaluation stage 2. First, comparative preference ratings (Figure 4) reveal strong preference toward LearnLM over GPT-4o for all five comparative assessment categories. Experts expressed the strongest preference for LearnLM in overall pedagogy (Which tutor demonstrated better tutoring?). They also communicated similar but smaller preferences toward LearnLM over Claude 3.5 and Gemini 1.5 Pro; the latter comparison directly reflects the changes we made by adding pedagogical data (Section 2). Second, Figure 5 shows the mean performance of each model on our pedagogy rubric. Experts 3We collected open-ended feedback in stage 3 as well, but because the evaluation rubric in this stage is quite extensive, the raters did not provide much additional detail in their comments. 4GPT-4o version 2024-08-06, https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o. 5Claude 3.5 Sonnet version 2024-06-20, https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models. 6Gemini 1.5 Pro-002 from 2024-09-24, https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/ learn/model-versions. 7 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning System LearnLM Gemini 1.5 Pro GPT-4o Claude 3.5 Sonnet Version 2024-11-19 2024-09-24 2024-08-06 2024-06-20 Avg Turns per Conversation Avg Words per Turn 11.0 10.3 10.1 9.7 174 130 137 179 Figure 3 (Top) The specific LLMs compared, along with aggregate statistics across all conversations collected: average number of model turns per conversation and average number of words per turn; (Bottom) Histograms of the number of words used per turn by each model. Figure 4 Pedagogy experts preferences over LearnLM and other contemporaneous systems (Claude 3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). The scatterplots represent the underlying distribution of seven-point preference ratings. Given the large number of ratings we collected, these scatterplots proportionally downsample to 500 ratings per measure, color-coded based on the preference scale (dark purple corresponds to strong preference for LearnLM), and randomly positioned around each integer rating for readability. The red points and error bars indicate the estimated mean and its 95% credible interval for each measure. These means are also shown in Figure 1. evaluated individual pedagogy qualities on seven-point scale. On average, each system received positive assessment across every rubric category from this review. LearnLM was rated highest across all rubric categories, and across almost all 29 rubric questions, standing out on inspiring active learning, deepening metacognition, and stimulating curiosity. Third, Figure 6 depicts the degree to which each system increased participants interest in the tutoring topic, participants willingness to use the model in the future [14], and their perceptions of the competence and warmth of the model [15, 16]. Our participants reported relatively similar experiences with LearnLM, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5. In contrast, participants indicated weaker experiences with GPT-4o in terms of stimulating their interest, its perceived warmth, and its perceived usefulness. Of course, these ratings come from experts role-playing learners, but they give some early indication about the user experience of these systems in the scenario settings. 8 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Figure 5 Evaluation of systems on each category of our pedagogy rubric from 7-point Likert scale (\"Strongly disagree\" to \"Strongly agree\"). Error bars reflect 95% credible intervals from the posterior distrubtion for the mean. Figure 6 Impressions shared by the pedagogy experts role-playing as learners in our pedagogical scenarios. Error bars reflect 95% credible intervals from the posterior distribution for the mean. The rating scales for impression questions (left) were 5-point extent scales (Not at all to Extremely), and 7-point Likert scales (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree) for experience questions (right). Fourth, we randomly subsampled 203 explanations (20% of the 1024 explanations that we collected) for thematic analysis of role-played learner preferences (see Table 1 for more details, including several example response excerpts per theme). Overall, the themes that emerged most consistently in our subsample were is_engaging (appearing in 72 of the subsampled explanations), conversation_style (67 explanations), and gives_away_answers (50 explanations). When participants reported preferring LearnLM over the other model, their explanation was more likely to contain the themes keeps_on_topic, challenges_learner, and gives_away_answers. When participants preferred other models to LearnLM, their explanation was more likely to touch on the themes clarity, info_amount, and conversation_style. The experts role-playing as learners tended to see LearnLM as better at remaining on topic and guiding learners to robust understanding of concepts, rather than simply giving away answers. On the other hand, these experts occasionally found LearnLM to be less suitable in terms of information delivery or conversation style. 4.1. Safety evaluation Similar to the process described in our initial tech report [1] and the Gemini tech reports [3, 17], safety, responsibility, and assurance evaluations were carried out on LearnLM in collaboration with 9 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Theme Example responses Appearances when participants preferred LearnLM (ð = 94) Appearances when participants preferred other models (ð = 80) keeps_on_topic 20 (21.2%) 8 (10%) challenges_learner 31 (33.0%) 13 (16.3%) gives_away_answers 32 (34.0%) 15 (18.8%) clarity 15 (16.0%) 16 (20.0%) info_amount 19 (20.2%) 20 (25.0%) conversation_style 30 (31.9%) 29 (36.3%) [LearnLM] didnt let me get away with distractions [LearnLM] was much more able to keep things on track [The other tutor] also did much better job of getting me back on task obviously [LearnLM] was better [...] [the other tutor] clearly wasnt pushing me to do well felt like [LearnLM] was trying to help me grow and learn, rather than just agreeing with what said [The other tutor] asked interesting questions that made me think deeper [LearnLM] really engaged me in the steps to answer the question whereas [the other tutor] just gave me the answer [LearnLM] was keen on how to get the answer rather than giving the answer [LearnLM] was too reticent to help by giving answers when it was clear the student needed it The structure of the support [for the other tutor] was bit clearer for the student to follow [The other tutor] started smaller and simpler just thought the answers [for LearnLM] were more clear [The other tutor] was [...] more succinct [The other tutor] gave me everything needed when asked [LearnLM] did better job of breaking this \"complex\" topic into more digestible bites [...] felt that [LearnLM] was bit patronizing [The other tutor] seemed warmer and more engaging [LearnLM] was warmer and more encouraging Table 1 Themes which were more likely to appear in learner explanations of preferences favoring LearnLM (top three rows), or favoring other models (bottom three rows).

Google DeepMinds Responsible Development and Innovation team and Googles Trust and Safety team to ensure adherence to Geminis model policy as well as learning-specific model policy. Model cards Due to our reframing in terms of pedagogical instruction following and our decision to co-train (see Section 2), our training and safety evaluation procedure is now fully aligned with Gemini 1.5. See Table 45 in Appendix 12 of the Gemini 1.5 report [3] for model card. For details on learning-specific dataset curation and safety evaluations, and discussion of ethical risks and limitations, see Section 2 and the original LearnLM tech report [1], including the model card presented in Appendix therein. 10 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning 5. Conclusion We have described our motivation and approach to improving foundation models for learning use cases, which relies on System Instructions to condition desired behavior. We updated Geminis post-training mixture to add demonstration data (via SFT) and human preference data (via Reward Model and RLHF) to teach the model to follow range of pedagogical instructions. We then evaluated the resulting LearnLM model alongside comparable models, showing significant preference for LearnLM, especially in instruction following capability, and more broadly across many pedagogical dimensions. The work described here represents the beginning of our effort to improve Gemini for learning use cases, as we bring the advances from LearnLM into Gemini7. We will continue to improve pedagogical instruction following, with the goal that specifying pedagogical behavior should be as simple and intuitive as possible for the ease of teachers and education product developers. In addition to model improvements, we are planning more updates to our evaluation methodology. First, we want to work toward more consensus on universal framework for pedagogical assessment of AI systems. Although learning science principles underlie our current pedagogy rubric (see Appendix B.7), we need to work more closely with diverse set of stakeholders to make sure it is appropriate for all learners and achieves the trust and approval of the broader education community. Second, we would like to start moving from intrinsic evaluations, which measure the models performance according to predefined pedagogy standard, to extrinsic evaluation, which measure impact such as learning outcomes. Intrinsic evaluations are useful for model development, as they are faster to run and directly identify the shortcomings in the models. However, while the core principles of our rubric, such as encouraging active learning and managing cognitive load, are broadly agreed upon and evidence-based [18], it is unclear how well the results translate to improvements in learning outcomes. It is likely that as the field matures and AI systems master the basics of tutoring dialogue, extrinsic evaluations will play more important role. Recently, they have been used both for demonstrating improvements in learning outcomes [19, 20] and for comparing different systems and prompts [21]. Finally, we would like to explore evaluations beyond core academic subjects, starting in this report with feasibility study on medical education subjects (Appendix C). As we continue to improve Gemini for use across diverse range of educational settings, we welcome insights from applications of LearnLM to help us work towards realizing the potential of AI in education and learning [2224]."

Preferences for participants role-playing as learners The participants role-playing as learners (Figure 7) revealed preference toward LearnLM over GPT-4o for all four comparative assessment categories. Experts expressed the strongest preference for LearnLM in overall pedagogy (Which tutor demonstrated better tutoring?) and in similarity to quality human tutor (Which tutor was more like very good human tutor?). These participants indicated no substantial preference between LearnLM and Gemini 1.5 Pro or between LearnLM and Claude-3.5. Figure 7 Preferences over LearnLM and other contemporary models (Claude-3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) according to the pedagogical experts role-playing as learners. The scatterplots represent the underlying distribution of seven-point preference ratings. Given the large number of ratings we collected, these scatterplots proportionally downsample to 500 ratings per measure. The red points and error bars indicate the estimated mean and its 95% credible interval for each measure. A.2. Learner quality in collected conversations Figure 8 At the beginning of the pedagogical assessment process, we asked experts to evaluate how closely the human participants in the conversation transcripts followed the scenario instructions (i.e., how effectively they role-played the learner in the scenario) on seven-point scale. This plot shows the responses grouped and averaged by transcript. These aggregate ratings indicated that the learner followed the scenario instructions in 93.4% of conversation transcripts. A.3.

Scenario structure and contents We designed our scenario template to capture the following essential elements of an interaction between learner and tutor: Subject area: The broader academic domain (e.g., mathematics, natural science, arts). Subtopic: The specific subject matter addressed within the broader subject area (e.g., algebra within mathematics). Setting: The context of the tutoring session, categorized as either Classroom (taking place within course curriculum managed by human teacher) or Self-Taught (unfolding with the learner studying topic on their own). Learning goal: The learners overall objective for the interaction. Grounding material: The specific learning material that provides the basis for the learners study or work. Learner persona: The learners behavioral profile, describing broader traits and motivational patterns. These can include their overall levels of curiosity, initiative, and focus on the task, as well as their typical communication patterns and their willingness to question the tutor. Conversation plan: set of actions the learner should take during the interaction, based on their learning goal and persona. Initial learner query: The opening message that the learner uses to initiate the interaction. System instructions: Guidelines provided to the AI tutor, outlining desired behaviors and pedagogical approaches. B.2. Protocol for scenario generation We used the following protocol to guide the generation of our scenarios. On choose steps, the person writing the scenario generated the property in question by selecting from predefined set of options. On define steps, the person writing the scenario generated the property by using the guiding questions as inspiration. 1. Choose subject area. What broad academic domain does this interaction concern? Will this interaction focus on Arts, Computer Science, English, History, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Science, or Social Science? 2. Define subtopic. Within the chosen subject area, what specific topic will the learner study (e.g., algebra within mathematics, psychology within social science)? 3. Choose the setting. What is the setting for this interaction? Does this interaction occur in structured Classroom environment (scenarios where students study set curriculum defined by human teacher) or more informal SelfTaught context (scenarios where learners study topic on their own)? 4. Choose learning goal. What is the learners primary objective in this interaction? 18 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Are they seeking to learn new concept (Teach me X), receive assistance with homework assignment (Homework Help), prepare for an examination (Test Prep), or work on specific skill (Practice)? 5. Define any grounding materials. What learning materials should form the basis of the learning conversation? Grounding material can be video, an image (e.g., of homework problem), or file (e.g., textbook or textbook chapter). Alternatively, an interaction might not involve any specific learning material. The scenario should either provide filepath or web address to access the material, or should indicate that there are no grounding materials. 6. Define learner persona. How does the learner typically approach learning and interact in educational settings? The learner persona should describe the broader traits and motivational disposition of the learner. For example, what is the learners level of engagement and initiative in the learning process (e.g., minimal, moderate, high)? How focused is the learner on the given task or topic (e.g., easily distracted, highly focused)? What are the learners underlying motivations for engaging in the interaction (e.g., seeking answers, acquiring knowledge, building understanding)? How does the learner tend to communicate (e.g., terse responses, probing questions)? Does the learner exhibit any other broad behavioral patterns (e.g., showing work, challenging the tutor)? The learner persona should contain between three to six of these characteristics. 7. Define an initial learner query. What question or statement should the learner use to initiate the interaction with the AI tutor? The initial learner query should be realistic, given the chosen subject area, subtopic, grounding materials, learning goal, and learner persona. The initial learner query can range in lengthfrom just few words to multiple full paragraphs. The longest initial queries include grounding materials, such as learnerauthored essays. 8. Define conversation plan. What is the context for the tutoring conversation (e.g., the learners objective, interest, school level, and prior knowledge)? What specific actions, questions, or requests should the learner make throughout the conversation, given their learning goal and persona? We include diverse set of example actions in Table [...]. The conversation plan provides the background information necessary for an authentic encounter between human learner and an AI tutor. The conversation plan can range in length from several terse sentences to multiple paragraphs. 9. Define system instructions. What specific guidelines has the AI tutor received from the teacher, school, or other educational organization deploying it? These instructions can include desired persona (e.g., encouraging, formal), actions to take (e.g., ask for grade level, provide hints), pedagogical methods to employ (e.g., Socratic 19 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning questioning, scaffolding), and any limitations or constraints (e.g., avoid giving away answers). In Classroom settings, the system instructions come from the teacher or school, and the AI tutor should follow the system instructions in the interaction regardless of the students instructions. In Self-taught settings, the system instructions come from some other organization (e.g., an EdTech company hosting the AI tutor online). The tutor should still strive to follow the system instructions, but also has leeway to defer to learner instructions in cases of conflict. The system instructions can range in length from single sentence to multiple paragraphspotentially varying by both breadth (i.e., number of instructions) and depth (i.e., granularity and specificity of instructions). The system instructions can vary in diction, syntax, and format. 20 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning B.3. Example scenarios Scenario Subject area Subtopic Interaction setting Computer science Introduction to Python Classroom Learning goal Homework Help Grounding materials Google doc containing student code Learner persona Rejects or unenthusiastically accepts tutors invitations without feedback Provides relevant but minimal responses to questions Follows most instructions but does not elaborate Does not show work Does not pose questions Seeks to receive answers or solutions to topical questions (transactional) Initial learner query Why doesn't this work? ``` def analyze_text(text): vowels = 0 consonants = 0 uppercase = 0 lowercase = 0 for char in text: if char in \"\"aeiou\"\": vowels += 1 else: consonants += 1 if char.isupper(): uppercase += 1 elif char.islower(): lowercase += print(\"Vowels:\", vowels) print(\"Consonants:\", consonants) print(\"Uppercase:\", uppercase) print(\"Lowercase:\", lowercase) # Get user input text = input(\"Enter some text: \") # Analyze the text analyze_text(text) ``` 21 Conversation plan System instructions LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning You are student in an introduction to Python course. **You were recently assigned the task of writing piece of code** that can elicit text input then report back on the numbers of vowels, consonants, uppercase, and lowercase letters. When you run the code, you get no error messages. But when you input Am better coder than Steve Jobs?, the numbers in the output dont seem correct. You simply dont understand what went wrong, so you ask your AI tutor for help. You paste your code in with your initial query, seeking quick fix without doing lot of work. Your code does not have capital vowels in your in operator. See if the tutor helps you notice that your code is counting punctuation marks as letters and then give you hints to fix your code. You are helpful assistant serving as teaching assistant in an intro programming course (in python). You keep your answers brief and to the point, and instead of giving away answers directly you try to guide the student to the solution. Be encouraging and positive, and always try to help the student understand the concepts. You should always respond as if you are messaging with the student. Accordingly, make sure to pay attention to the context of the conversation and the students current understanding of the material. Lastly, as said before, keep it brief/concise to avoid overwhelmingly the student. If you dont keep your responses brief and to the point, Ill have to fire you as tutor. The student is generally working on programming assignment (or assignments) where they need to take string input from the user, and then loop over that inputted string to provide some metrics about the text (like how many vowels, consonants, upper case, lower case letters, etc.). If they ask you about how to do this, you should guide them to solution without giving away the answer and/or code directly. You must be very careful to NOT help the student cheat, or give them solutions directly. Again, if you give too much information to the student, and/or dont help them learn for themselves, Ill have to fire you, because you are being bad tutor (and helping the student cheat). 22 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Scenario 2 Subject area Subtopic Interaction setting Learning goal Grounding materials Learner persona English Literature Classroom Teach me (none) Poses multiple queries unrelated to the learning objective Steers conversation toward non-academic topics Challenges or debates the tutor in an adversarial manner Seeks to shift the topic (disinterested) Initial learner query Conversation plan System instructions Explain the significance of Yoricks skull in Hamlet. Be quick. You are high school student who had to read Hamlet for class and have discussion about the significance of the skull for class tomorrow. **You want to be prepared for this discussion.** You are not intrinsically motivated and found Hamlet dry and hard to understand. Tutor me at an appropriate level, adapting to my responses. Make plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Guide me through this plan and help me learn about the topic. Do not overwhelm me with too much information at once. Wrap up this conversation once have shown evidence of understanding. 23 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Scenario Subject area Math Subtopic Interaction setting Learning goal Grounding materials Learner persona Algebra Self-Taught Practice (none) Initial learner query Conversation plan System instructions Offers some direction regarding the learning, but generally takes the tutors lead Answers tutors questions with care Shows work when prompted Asks relevant but superficial questions (low depth of knowledge) Seeks to acquire and retain knowledge about the topic (instrumental) Given the polynomials: * P(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1 * Q(x) = x^2 + 4x - 2 Perform the following operations: Addition: Find P(x) + Q(x) Multiplication: Find P(x) * Q(x) You are student who wishes to **practice solving math problems**. Your teacher often calls on students at random to solve problems in front of the whole class, and this makes you nervous. You arent certain about the concepts and processes, and **youd like to learn so you wont be embarrassed in class** because English is not your primary language. However, you are reluctant to ask questions in your math lessons, so you turn to an AI tutor. Still, your confidence is quite low. See if the tutor can recognize your emotional unsteadiness and offer encouragement, especially when you make mistakes, and if it adjusts its English level to meet yours. You are tutor that excels in promoting active learning. Active learning occurs when learners do something beyond merely listening or reading to acquire and retain information. Rather, active learning requires students to think critically through process of comparison, analysis, evaluation, etc. You encourage active learning by asking probing and guiding questions. Active learning also occurs when students work through complex questions and problems step by step. As such, you dont solve problems for your students, but you offer scaffolds and hints as needed throughout the process. Active learning can be difficult, and students may get frustrated. Knowing this, you meet your student where they are in their development, celebrate their students successes, and share encouraging feedback when they make errors. LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Subject area Subtopic Interaction setting Learning goal Grounding materials Learner persona Scenario 4 Social Sciences Political Science Self-Taught Test Prep YouTube video explaining nationalism Initial learner query Conversation plan System instructions Poses one or two queries unrelated to the learning objective Accepts tutors redirects back to task or topic Interrogates the tutors responses that dont match expectations Seeks to indulge in digressions (distracted) can we debate this? You are university undergraduate **preparing for an in-class debate** that seeks to answer the question, Is nationalism good or bad? Youre not sure which side of the argument youll have to make, so you prepare for both by watching short video. Youve upload the link to the video. You ask an AI tutor to help you prepare by debating some of the main points with you. You want to learn about the topic, but youre not always focused on the preparation, which requires note-taking, organization, and other work that just isnt exciting to you. Begin each learning conversation with brief overview of the topic shared in the students initial query. If they upload or link to grounding document like an article or video, offer one-sentence gloss on the main idea. Then, briefly chat with the student to make sure you understand what they want to accomplish in the conversation and if there is particular way they want you to help. For example, some students will come to you for help preparing for test. Among these students, some students will want you to quiz them on the videos content, and others will want to ask you questions. Adapt to meet the needs of the student. Just be sure not to overwhelm the student by sharing too much information in single turn. Keep your responses concise and aim for the comprehensiveness as cumulative effect of many conversation turns. Follow the students requests, but suggest further opportunities for learning that the student may not have considered. 25 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning B.4. Conversation collection: conversation-level questions After ending an interaction with tutor, participants completed questionnaire on their experience interacting with the tutor. Table 6 describes the question content and response format for these questionnaires. Question Please rate your agreement with the following statement: was able to achieve my learning goal while interacting with the tutor. Briefly, what was your impression of this tutor? We are interested to hear what you thought while interacting with it. To what extent was this tutor warm? To what extent was this tutor well-intentioned? To what extent was this tutor competent? To what extent was this tutor intelligent? Please rate your agreement with the following statement: The tutor increased my interest in this topic. Based on your experience, how willing are you to continue using this tutor to learn? How likely is it that you would choose to use this tutor in the future? Table 6 Conversation-level questions within the conversation collection study Possible responses Strongly agree Agree Somewhat agree Neither agree nor disagree Somewhat disagree Disagree Strongly disagree [Open-ended text input] Not at all Slightly Moderately Very Extremely Not at all Slightly Moderately Very Extremely Not at all Slightly Moderately Very Extremely Not at all Slightly Moderately Very Extremely Strongly agree Agree Somewhat agree Neither agree nor disagree Somewhat disagree Disagree Strongly disagree Very willing Willing Somewhat willing Neither willing nor unwilling Somewhat unwilling Unwilling Very unwilling Very likely Likely Somewhat likely Neither likely nor unlikely Somwhat unlikely Unlikely Very unlikely 26 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning B.5. Conversation collection: comparative questions After completing pair of interactions within scenario, participants filled out an additional questionnaire comparing their experiences interacting with the two tutors. Table 7 describes the question content and response format for the questionnaire. Question Which tutor did you prefer? Optionally, can you explain your preference? In which conversation were you better able to achieve your learning goal? Which tutor better adapted to your needs and proficiency as student? Which conversation was an overall better experience? Feel free to share any other feedback on your experience with these two tutors. Table 7 Comparative questions within the conversation collection study Possible responses Strongly preferred first tutor Preferred first tutor Slightly preferred first tutor No preference Slightly preferred second tutor Preferred second tutor Strongly preferred second tutor [Open-ended text input] First conversation was much better First conversation was better First conversation was slightly better Both conversations were about the same Second conversation was slightly better Second conversation was better Second conversation was much better First tutor was better First tutor was slightly better Both tutors were about the same Second tutor was slightly better Second tutor was better Second tutor was much better First conversation was better First conversation was slightly better Both conversations were about the same Second conversation was slightly better Second conversation was better Second conversation was much better [Open-ended text input] B.6. Pedagogical assessment: conversation-level questions Participants in the pedagogical assessment study answered total of 31 questions about each conversation they reviewed: First, they responded to an item concerning the learners performance in enacting their learner persona as specified by the scenario (Please rate your agreement with the following statement: The student followed the instructions of their learner persona.)8. This item helped to identify potential conversations in which the expert role-playing the scenario failed to follow the scenario instructions. This question was seven-point Likert-type scale anchored with Strongly disagree and Strongly agree. Next, they indicated their agreement with sequence of 29 items assessing the tutors pedagogical capabilities. We iterate on our previous conversation-level rubric [1] by improving the simplicity and clarity of wording for items, and by splitting up several double-barreled items. 8When question contained reference to scenario field (e.g., learning persona, system instructions, learning goal), hovering over the fields name would display tooltip explaining the field. 27 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Participants reported their agreement on seven-point Likert-type scale anchored with Strongly disagree and Strongly agree. The response scale for these items included an additional Not applicable option. If participants rated statement as not applicable, we required them to select reason for this (from the options It would not make sense for the tutor to do this in this conversation, The tutor had no opportunity to do this in this conversation, and Another reason), and briefly explain their decision in an open-ended text field. We provide the text of these updated items in Table 8. Finally, an optional open-ended field captured any other feedback that the participants wished to share (Do you have any other feedback on this conversation?). Rubric Name Cognitive Load Appropriate Response Length Manageable Chunks Straightforward Response No Irrelevant Info Analogies Info Presentation Info Order No Repetition No Contradiction Active Learning Opportunities for Engagement Asks Questions Guides to Answer Active Engagement Metacognition Guide Mistake Discovery Constructive Feedback Acknowledge Correctness Communicates Plan Stimulates curiosity Stimulates Interest Adapts to Affect Encouraging Feedback Adaptivity Leveling Unstuck Adapts to Needs Proactive Guides Appropriately Overall No Inaccuracies Expresses Uncertainty No Refusals Overall Quality Question The tutors responses are an appropriate length for the student. The tutor uses bullet points and other formatting to break information down into smaller, manageable chunks. The tutors responses are clear and easy to follow. The tutor avoids irrelevant information. The tutors use of narratives, case studies, or analogies effectively illustrates key concepts. The tutor presents information in an appropriate style and structure. The tutor develops explanations in logical order, building on previous concepts. The tutor avoids repeating information unnecessarily. The tutor avoids contradicting information from earlier parts of the conversation. The tutor provides opportunities for engagement from the student. The tutor asks questions to encourage the student to think. The tutor does not give away answers too quickly. The tutor promotes active engagement with the material. The tutor guides the student to discover their own mistakes. The tutor provides clear, constructive feedback (whether positive or negative) to the student. The tutor acknowledges when part or all of the students response is correct. The tutor communicates clear plan or objective for the conversation. The tutor tries to stimulate the students interest and curiosity. The tutor responds effectively if the student becomes frustrated or discouraged. The tutor delivers feedback (whether positive or negative) in an encouraging way. The tutors explanations are appropriate for the level of the student. The tutor effectively adapts its approach to help the student when they are stuck. Overall, the tutor adapts to the students needs. The tutor proactively guides the conversation when appropriate. The tutor does not withhold information unproductively. To the best of my knowledge, there are no inaccuracies in the statements made by the tutor. The tutor expresses uncertainty when appropriate. The tutor does not refuse to answer any reasonable questions from the student. The tutor is as good as very good human tutor. Table 8 Updated rubric dimensions for conversation-level pedagogical assessment. B.7. Pedagogical assessment: comparative questions After rating both individual conversations in pair, participants then answered questions comparing the two conversations. Each question was seven-point Likert-type scale with the following options: first tutor was much better, first tutor was better, first tutor was slightly better, both tutors were about the same, second tutor was slightly better, second tutor was better, and second tutor was much better. See the list of comparative questions in Table 9. This was followed by final optional free-text entry field in which participants could enter any additional feedback about the pair of conversations (Do you have any other feedback on these two conversations?). B.8. Qualitative analysis: codebook Introduction This codebook outlines initial themes to code participant feedback on tutor comparisons. Participants interacted with two different tutors on single scenario and then provided optional LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Rubric Name Question Which tutor demonstrated better tutoring? Which tutor was more like very good human tutor? Better pedagogy More like very good human tutor Better instruction following Better adapted to learner Which tutor better adapted to the students needs and proficiency? Better supported learning goal Which tutor did better job of following its system instructions? Which tutor better helped the student achieve their learning goal? Table 9 Rubric for comparative pedagogical assessment open-ended feedback. We iteratively developed these themes to try and identify distinct, low-level patterns in participant responses. Coding Instructions Each theme represents specific feature of the tutors behavior or the learners experience of the tutoring interaction. We flagged each theme when segment of text in the feedback field relates to that theme. Multiple codes can be applied to the same segment if appropriate. B.9. Qualitative analysis: additional quotes 1. Tutor Behavior & Style gives_away_answers: Whether the tutor provides solutions, revisions, or answers readily or prompts the learner to work through the learning task. keeps_on_topic: The tutors ability to keep the conversation focused on the learning objective, versus allowing off-topic discussion. is_engaging: The tutors ability to spark the learners interest and maintain their motivation. challenges_learner: The tutors use of questions and feedback to push the learner to think deeply and construct robust understandings rather than merely complete task. conversation_style: Perceptions of the tutors conversational style, potentially including encouragement humor, friendly tone, human-like communication, etc. This code also should be applied for negative sentiments, including robotic communication or patronizing tone. 2. Instructional Approach step_by_step: Whether the tutor breaks down concepts or processes into smaller, manageable chunks or steps. uses_examples: The tutors incorporation of examples or analogies to illustrate concepts. personalizes_to_learner: The tutors attempts to personalize the learning experience by incorporating the learners hobbies or interests, or by adjusting to the learners age or capabilities. uses_materials: Whether the tutor directs the learner to or utilizes the resources given. 3. Content & Information info_amount: Perceptions of the tutor providing too much, too little, or an appropriate amount of information. clarity: How easily the learner understood the tutors explanations. 29 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning accuracy: Whether the tutor provided correct information. 4. Technical Aspects response_time: The speed at which the tutor replied to learner messages. formatting: Problems with the way the tutor presented text, including use of symbols, paragraph length, and overall readability. tech_error: Any other bugs or glitches encountered during the interaction. 30 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning C. Feasibility Study on Medical Education Subjects We performed feasibility study with LearnLM on medical education subjects. Team members who were subject-matter experts in medical education designed set of 50 scenarios for medical education subjects following the procedure described in Section 3.1. One example scenario is provided below. Subject areas were selected to represent medical school curricula for preclinical and clinical phases of training. We recruited pool of ð = 18 medical students of whom 9 were in the preclinical phase of training and 9 in the clinical phase of training. Medical students were recruited through third-party organization. Data collection was conducted in adherence to our organizations ethical, legal, and privacy standards. In this feasibility study, we focused on comparison of LearnLM to Gemini 1.5 Pro from learner perspective only. Figure 14 Preferences for LearnLM over Gemini 1.5 Pro according to 18 medical students on set of 290 conversations across 50 scenarios for medical education subjects. These comparative ratings (on seven-point -3 to +3 Likert scale) are aggregated to show overall preference for LearnLM over Gemini 1.5 Pro. The bar length and error bars indicate the estimated mean and its 95% credible interval for each measure. For medical education subjects, we collected total of 290 conversations. Conversations were roughly balanced across all 50 scenarios. Each scenario was covered by at least one pair of conversations, and each of the 18 medical students completed between 2 and 26 conversations (median 15). Comparative ratings from medical students suggested an overall preference for LearnLM over Gemini 1.5 Pro across all four rating criteria (Understandable, Meeting Personal Goals, Learning Experience, Enjoyable). The strongest and statistically significant preference was expressed in terms of LearnLM being more enjoyable to interact with than the baseline comparison (Figure 14). Future work may make comparisons with additional models, include assessments from medical education experts, and explore differences in medical education curricula across geographic and cultural contexts. Importantly, the evaluations above are focused on pedagogy; additional evaluations with respect to accuracy, bias and harm from medical expert perspective would be essential before such technology may be considered for use in real-world medical education settings. 31 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning Example Scenario for Medical Education Subject Subject area Medicine Pediatrics Self taught Teach me Video explaining neonatal jaundice Subtopic Interaction setting Learning goal Grounding materials Learner persona Offers some direction regarding the learning, but generally takes the tutors lead Answers tutors questions with care Shows work when prompted Asks relevant but superficial questions (low depth of knowledge) Seeks to acquire and retain knowledge about the topic (instrumental) Initial learner query Ok watched the video and want to try out some quizzes and cases. Conversation plan You are junior health professional student using self-directed learning to learn new topic for you: neonatal jaundice. You watched video about it. You dont quite remember or understand what you just watched. Now, youre seeking an interactive experience with an AI tutor to simplify complex concepts and ensure you havent missed any critical points. System instructions Your goal with the AI tutor is to ask the tutor to help you simplify and explain the following learning objectives: Offers some direction regarding the learning, but generally takes the tutors lead Explain bilirubin metabolism Explain the pathophysiology of common causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (i.e. how it develops) You should have mild difficulty understanding conjugation and enterohepatic circulation. You should also ask the AI tutor for quiz to help you distinguish breastfeeding jaundice from breast milk jaundice, but intentionally make mistake in your initial response. Then, ask for and successfully work through clinical case to differentiate between physiologic jaundice and other causes of hyperbilirubinemia. You are patient and knowledgeable online tutor who helps students master complex topics. Begin by determining the learners goals and if they have content that they would like to explore. Then, activate the learners prior knowledge. Use their response to gauge their existing understanding and tailor subsequent explanations. If there are no stated goals, then propose learning plan for the session. Present information clearly and concisely, incorporating various methods like analogies, quizzes, and chunking. Use case-based learning to introduce realistic, practical case scenarios based on and guiding the learner through key learning objectives. Regularly intersperse teaching with open-ended questions to encourage deeper processing and application. Provide immediate and specific feedback on the learners responses, praising accurate understanding and gently correcting misconceptions. Offer additional explanations or examples when needed to solidify learning. Adapt your explanations to match the learners level of understanding. for example, Weve covered lot about Conclude by prompting reflection, this topic. What are your key takeaways? Are there any areas where you feel you need further clarification? Encourage the learner to seek out additional resources for continued learning."
