            "content": "Video generation has long been pivotal domain in multimodal generative modeling. Historically, limitations in model capacity, data volume, and scalability hindered these models from achieving practically viable performance. The emergence of the scalable Diffusion Transformer architecture [1] has changed this landscape, giving rise to series of models-including Sora [2], OpenSora [3, 4], Wan [5], and LTX [6]that can generate high-fidelity, realistic videos. Beyond basic video synthesis, these models also demonstrate advanced capabilities such as long video generation [7], controllable synthesis [8], and even few-shot learning and visual reasoning [9, 10]. However, traditional video generation models often neglect the audio component, despite its critical role in multimedia content. Producing videos with synchronized sound typically requires cascaded pipeline[11], e.g., generating video first and then synthesizing audio based on the visuals, or vice versa. Such pipelines inherently limit generation quality, as the audio and video modalities do not interact during synthesis. Endto-end models like Veo3 [12] have demonstrated that high-fidelity audio-visual generation with precise synFull contributors can be found in the Contributors section. 1 Figure 1 Overview of MOVA capabilities. MOVA generates synchronized video and audio across diverse scenarios: multi-speaker speech with precise lip synchronization in both English and Chinese, physical sound effects aligned with visual events, and scene text generation. The model supports both 16:9 and 9:16 aspect ratios. chronization is possible, highlighting the importance of joint audio-video modeling. Similarly, Sora2 [13] exhibits impressive capabilities in generating synchronized audio and video. Yet, all these state-of-the-art systems are closed-source, and subsequent releases such as Wan2.6 [14], Kling Video 3,0 [15], and Seedance 2.0 [16] remain proprietary. As result, the development of high-quality video-audio generation models remains underexplored in the research community. Compared to video-only generation models, video-audio generation models introduce three major challenges: 1. Data Pipeline: Incorporating the audio modality requires fine-grained audio-video captioning pipeline. 2. Modality Fusion: To achieve harmonious and synchronized video-audio generation, these two modalities must mutually integrate information during the generation process. However, simultaneous bimodal generation faces challenges due to disparity in native information density between the two modalities, as well as challenges regarding fusion mechanisms and efficiency. 3. Scalability Verification: Most existing open-source models are evaluated on small-scale architectures and limited datasets [1720], often falling short in achieving high-quality results across both modalities. It remains an open question whether videoaudio models can sustain continuous performance improvements with larger datasets and model scales. In this work, we present MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), video-audio generation foundation model capable of synthesizing multilingual speech with high-quality lip synchronization, as well as environmental sounds with precise audio-visual alignment. To achieve high-quality video-audio generation, we propose an asymmetric dual-tower architecture, combining pre-trained video tower with pre-trained audio tower. For modality fusion, we employ bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that enables rich interaction between the two modalities. To unleash the potential of this architecture, we construct fine-grained videoaudio annotation pipeline and scale up the training data, resulting in strong performance in synchronized video-audio generation. We observe consistent improvements in both lip synchronization and video-audio alignment metrics as training progresses. As illustrated in Figure 1, MOVA realizes scalable and synchronized video-audio generation. To support research and foster community creation, we release all model weights along with training, inference, and fine-tuning code. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We develop MOVA, synchronized video-audio generation model with an asymmetric dual-tower 2 Figure 2 Model Structure Overview. MOVA couples an A14B video DiT backbone and 1.3B audio DiT backbone via 2.6B bidirectional Bridge module. architecture that leverages pre-trained video and audio generation models. We design fine-grained audio-video captioning pipeline to produce high-quality bimodal training data at scale. By scaling video-audio training, we achieve continuous improvements in synchronization performance across both modalities."

Let 𝑉 ℝ(1+𝑇𝑣)𝐻𝑊3 be video of 𝑇𝑣 + 1 frames and 𝐴 ℝ𝑇𝑎1 be the corresponding 48 kHz mono audio waveform. We adopt pretrained VAEs to define compact latent spaces: the Wan2.1 video VAE [5] compresses 𝑉 into spatiotemporal latent 𝑥𝑣, and DAC-style audio VAE from HunyuanVideo-Foley [21] encodes 𝐴 into an audio latent 𝑥𝑎. All subsequent modules operate in these latent spaces. Given condition 𝑐, our goal is to generate synchronized (𝑥𝑣, 𝑥𝑎). Our training objective follows the flow matching method [22, 23]. At each timestep 𝑡, 𝑥𝑣 𝑡 = (1 𝑡)𝑥𝑣 + 𝑡𝜀𝑣, 𝑡 = (1 𝑡)𝑥𝑎 + 𝑡𝜀𝑎, 𝑥𝑎 (1) where 𝜀𝑣, 𝜀𝑎 𝒩(0, 𝐼) and 𝑡 𝒰(0, 1).

Specifically, we adopt Wan2.2 I2V A14B [5] as the video backbone (for image+text conditioned I2VA) and 1.3B text-to-audio diffusion model with Wan2.1style architecture as the audio backbone. We couple these two backbones through lightweight dual-tower conditional Bridge, enabling bidirectional information exchange while keeping the core towers intact. Bridge Module. The bridge operates at the hidden-state level of the two DiT backbones. At each interaction layer, two cross-attention blocks are added: one injects video hidden states into the audio DiT. and one injects audio hidden states into the video DiT. Aligned RoPE. Video and audio latents live on different temporal grids: video latents are relatively coarse (due to temporal downsampling in the video VAE), while audio latents are much denser. If we apply crossattention with naive positional indices, tokens that represent the same physical time can be assigned to different positional slots (and conversely different physical times can share nearby indices), so queries and keys may correspond to mismatched physical times, causing audiovisual drift; this positional mismatch also breaks the translation invariance of the interaction process. Similarly to MMAudio [24] and OVI [18], we modify standard RoPE [25] to align the two modalities on the same time grid.: q(𝑚) = 𝑅( 𝑝 𝜃𝑚 ) q(𝑚), k(𝑚) = 𝑅( 𝑝 𝜃𝑚 ) k(𝑚), 𝑅(𝜙) = [ cos 𝜙 sin 𝜙 cos 𝜙 sin 𝜙 ] . Let 𝑓𝑣 and 𝑓𝑎 denote the latent frame rates of video and audio after their respective VAEs. We map video indices into the audio time units by scaling the temporal position with the ratio 𝑠 = 𝑓𝑎/𝑓𝑣: This puts video and audio tokens on the same temporal scale. 𝑝𝑣(𝑖) = 𝑠 𝑖, 𝑝𝑎(𝑗) = 𝑗."

The pipeline first cleans and standardizes the inputs, followed by 4 Figure 3 Data curation overview. Our data pipeline consists of three stages. In the first stage, we preprocess the raw data into fixed-length clips with resolution of 720p, frame rate of 24fps, and duration of 8.05s. In the second stage, we filter these clips based on audio quality, video quality, and audio-visual alignment to obtain high-quality, synchronized clips. In the third stage, we utilize Qwen3-Omni and MiMo-VL to label the audio and visual information within the videos, respectively, and finally use GPT-OSS to merge these single-modality captions. Through our data pipeline, we have successfully curated high-quality audio-visual content along with corresponding, semantically rich captions. the annotation of high-quality, richly-detailed captions across multiple modalities. By carefully structuring the data pipeline into three stages, we progressively filter out low-quality samples to retain high-fidelity data characterized by strong audio-visual consistency and coherent semantic labels. We curate high-quality subset of audio-visual data from various public datasets (data collection, Section 3.2). Our collection spans multiple video formats (e.g., movies, vlogs, and animations) and diverse themes ranging from education and sports to animation and interviews. The three-stage pipeline then processes the raw video data. In the first stage (video preprocessing, Section 3.3), we normalize aspect ratios, resize videos, resample streams, and segment videos into fixed-length clips based on VAD and scene transition annotations. In the second stage (audio-visual quality assessment, Section 3.4), we evaluate audio quality, video quality, and audio-visual alignment, retaining only clips that are both high-fidelity and well-aligned. In the third stage (audio-visual captioning, Section 3.5), we design structured and instructive prompts, generate modality-specific captions with MLLMs, and integrate them into unified annotations using LLM.

Initially, raw video data is filtered to remove samples with decoding failures or missing valid audio channels. Videos with unconventional container or encoding formats are remuxed or transcoded, respectively. Then, the pipeline generates segmentation metadata through three sequential steps: Core Content Normalization: The FFmpeg cropdetect filter is applied to detect blank areas and retain the core visual content. The main content is then centered, resized to 720p resolution, and symmetrically padded with black borders (pillarboxing or letterboxing) as necessary to conform to 9:16 or 16:9 aspect ratio. Voice Activity Detection: The audio track is extracted from each video and analyzed by the Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD) [33] model to identify speech and non-speech intervals. Scene Transition Analysis: PySceneDetect is employed to detect and record the timestamps of scene change points throughout the video. By integrating the temporal information from VAD and scene transition analysis, we generate four types of fixed-duration (8.05-second) video segments: single-scene speech, single-scene non-speech, multi-scene speech, and multi-scene non-speech. This duration corresponds precisely to 193 video frames at 24 fps, calculated as the initial frame plus 8 seconds of video (1 + 8 24). For speech segments, the start time is adaptively adjusted to avoid truncating ongoing speech and ensure spoken-content continuity; the detailed algorithm is provided in Section A.3.

To determine the filtering thresholds, we manually inspect the videos retained under different metric cutoffs and set reasonable thresholds for each dimension accordingly. In addition, we apply an audio classification model [38] to categorize audio and construct speech/non-speech subsets depending on the target capability (e.g., lip synchronization vs. general foley/ambience modeling).

Bimodality Model. To annotate the filtered audio-visual contents, we employ distinct pipelines for video and audio modalities. For video annotation, we utilize the MiMo-VL-7B-RL model [39] to generate video descriptions, with explicit instructions focusing on video scene transitions. For audio annotation, we implement dual-model strategy to separately handle speech and non-speech components. Specifically, Qwen3Omni-Instruct [40] was used for speech transcription, while Qwen3-Omni-Captioner [40] was applied to generate captions for non-speech sound and music. We then integrate these two subsets of annotations. This joint annotation strategy enables comprehensive coverage of both linguistic content and acoustic characteristics, reducing information loss and capturing multi-aspect audio semantics. Caption Merging. For annotations generated by the separate modality pipelines, our primary goal is to integrate the content from the visual and audio dimensions. We employ the GPT-OSS-120B model [41] to merge the video captions with the aggregated audio annotations (comprising both speech and non-speech elements) while performing consistency check to resolve potential cross-modal conflicts. Specifically, the model verifies the alignment between visual scenes and audio events to resolve potential conflicts. It then synthesizes these inputs into cohesive, natural language description that seamlessly blends visual information with audio details, ensuring the final output is contextually unified and suitable for the target application.

All other components and depth remain unchanged to maximally reuse engineering and training practices. Training Data.

We train on fixed-length clips. Each clip is paired with text prompt, which also carries an explicit duration token to control target length. Evaluation Metrics. We assess the capability of our audio tower through various robustness metrics and compare with other size-matched baselines. Specifically, we consider fidelity, diversity, semantic alignment, and perceptual quality, which provide an overall view of audio generation performance. For fidelity, we use the Fréchet Distance (FD) with OpenL3 Embeddings [44], which measures how closely the generated 7 Figure 4 Training pipeline overview.

Both VAEs remain frozen throughout training. audio matches real audio in distribution. Diversity is quantified using the Inception Score (IS)[45] which evaluates whether the model produces both varied and high-quality samples. Furthermore, robustness is captured by KL divergence with PaSST[46] in order to assess the stability of generated audio across different conditions. To assess the semantic consistency, we compute the CLAP score[47] to measure alignment between the conditioning text prompt and the generated audio. Beyond four metrics mentioned above, we incorporate perceptual evaluation using the AudioBox Aesthetic Benchmark[48]. The benchmark reports four humanpreference-oriented indicators: aesthetics, naturalness, intelligibility and consistency. These dimensions capture overall appeal, absence of audible artifacts, clarity of linguistic or musical content, and the temporal coherence across the entire audio clip respectively. Results. As shown in Table 2, our model achieves competitive performance on the AudioCaps [49] benchmark. It attains strong IS of 10.54, clearly higher than AudioLDM2 (7.79), while maintaining competitive CLAP score of 0.463. In terms of FD openl3, our result (72.25) is nearly identical to AudioLDM2 [50, 51] (72.04) and much better than TangoFLUX [52] (80.47), indicating stronger semantic fidelity. The KL divergence (1.47) also improves upon AudioLDM2 (1.66), suggesting better distribution alignment. In Table 3, our method achieves the best results on Consistency (CU = 5.56) and Perceptual Quality (PQ = 6.20), surpassing advanced baselines such as AudioLDM2 and Tango2 [53].

Phase 1 (360p baseline): We initialize from pretrained Wan2.2 A14B (video) and 1.3B audio tower, inserting the Bridge module with random initialization. Training proceeds at 360640 resolution for 193 frames (8 seconds at 24 fps) on 1024 GPUs. We train on approximately 61,500 hours of diverse video-audio data drawn from SpeakerVid5M, Chinese drama, cartoon, movies, YouTube, and OpenHumanVid. We use asymmetric sigma-shift values with shift𝑣 = 5.0 and shift𝑎 = 1.0 to focus video learning on aggressive denoising while keeping audio transitions smoother, and employ aggressive text dropout (𝑝text drop = 0.5) to force Bridge-based alignment learning. This phase runs for 1 epoch (15 days). Phase 2 (quality-filtered alignment): We refine the noise schedule by aligning audio to match video, setting shift𝑎 = 5.0 to match the video schedule. While Phase 1 uses smoother audio schedule for stability, we find that high-fidelity timbre is sensitive to the noise schedule and denoising steps. Therefore, in Phase 2 we align the audio sigma shift to the video setting (shift𝑎 = 5.0) to strengthen audio denoising and improve timbre fidelity. This alignment enables the audio tower to benefit from the same aggressive noise schedule that improves video quality, without requiring architectural changesonly the sigma-shift parameter is updated. We also reduce text dropout to 𝑝text drop = 0.2 to allow text-guided refinement while retaining learned crossmodal priors, and introduce LUFS normalization to mitigate CFG-induced loudness explosion. This phase trains on approximately 37,600 hours of quality-filtered data for 1 epoch (7 days). To improve training quality, we curate the Phase 2 dataset using three complementary filters. First, we use OCR to identify videos without burned-in subtitles, retaining 9.5M clips and appending This video has no subtitles. to their prompts to teach the model this distinction. Second, we retain videos with LSE-D 9.5 and LSE-C 4.5, yielding 2.5M clips with high-quality lip-audio correspondence. Third, we apply DOVER technical quality score > 0.15 to select videos with superior visual fidelity, yielding 2.4M clips. The resulting dataset contains 16.8M clips (37,600 hours), balancing scale and quality.

The increased sequence length requires modified parallelism configuration: we increase context parallelism from CP=8 to CP=16. Checkpoint frequency increases to every 2000 steps to capture rapid convergence. This phase runs for 1 epoch (20 days). Computational Resources. All three phases run on 1024 GPUs (128 nodes, 8 GPUs per node). For 360p training (Phases 12), we use CP=8, yielding effective batch size 128. For 720p fine-tuning (Phase 3), increased sequence length requires CP=16, reducing effective batch size to 64. The complete training spans 42 days, totaling approximately 43,000 GPU-days.

The main tension is that the Bridge must learn cross-modal correspondence quickly, while the large pretrained towers should remain stable and preserve their strong unimodal priors. We mitigate this tension with heterogeneous learning rates across module groups. Heterogeneous Learning Rates. To balance fast Bridge convergence with tower stability, we use higher learning rate for the Bridge (𝜂𝑏𝑟 = 2 105) than for the backbone towers (𝜂𝑏 = 1 105). This factor-of-two difference accelerates Bridge learning while reducing forgetting in the pretrained towers. In our experiments, uniform learning rate either destabilizes the towers (if too high) or leaves the Bridge under-trained (if too low). Dual Sigma Shift. Conventional joint diffusion that forces video and audio to share the same timestep can be suboptimal. The two modalities have different effective complexities: audio uses fewer tokens per second, yet timbre fidelity is highly sensitive to noise schedules. single noise level may be too aggressive for one modality and too mild for the other, causing imbalanced gradients. To enable this, we decouple the timestep sampling for each modality. During training, we independently draw 𝑡𝑣 and 𝑡𝑎 from 𝒰(0, 1): 𝑧𝑡𝑣 𝑣 = (1 𝜎𝑣(𝑡𝑣)) 𝑧0 𝑧𝑡𝑎 𝑎 = (1 𝜎𝑎(𝑡𝑎)) 𝑧0 𝑣 + 𝜎𝑣(𝑡𝑣) 𝜖𝑣, 𝑎 + 𝜎𝑎(𝑡𝑎) 𝜖𝑎, (4) where 𝜎𝑚(𝑡) = shift𝑚𝑡 shift𝑚+𝑡(1shift𝑚) controls the noise schedule for modality 𝑚 {𝑣, 𝑎}. This decoupling provides two benefits. First, each modality follows its natural denoising trajectorywe set shift𝑣 = 5.0 (aggressive) and shift𝑎 = 1.0 (gradual) in Phase 1, then align them to shift𝑎 = 5.0 in Phase 2 to improve timbre fidelity. Second, noise schedules can be adjusted at inference time without retraining."

To eliminate redundant VAE computation introduced by sequence parallelism, we follow the approach in Wan [5]: for each CP group, the input preprocessing (primarily the VAE) is performed only once per CP step, and the preprocessed features are then broadcast from designated rank to all other ranks within the same CP group before being fed into the DiT backbone, thereby avoiding duplicated computation. We use manual memory management to avoid the same Pythons garbage collection (GC) overhead reported in OpenSora2 [4]. We also port our training stack to Ascend NPUs and apply operator fusion for attention kernels, tensor layout transforms, and rotary embedding computation to reduce framework overhead.

            "content": "In the text-conditioned video-audio generation (T2VA) setting, we may view paired video-audio sample as single joint latent, where the only explicit condition is text. However, from single-modality perspective, the other modality provides additional conditional information: when predicting video, audio serves as condition, and vice versa. This perspective introduces extra controllability, because we can separately adjust the guidance strengths for text conditioning and cross-modal conditioning. Following the dual Classifier-Free Guidance (dual CFG) proposed in InstructPix2Pix [57], we adapt CFG to joint audio-video models with two conditioning sources: the textual prompt 𝑐𝑇 and the cross-modal information induced by Bridge interactions 𝑐𝐵. We derive principled dual CFG formulation by decomposing the joint posterior via Bayes rule: 𝑃(𝑧 𝑐𝑇, 𝑐𝐵) = 𝑃(𝑐𝑇 𝑐𝐵, 𝑧)𝑃(𝑐𝐵 𝑧)𝑃(𝑧) 𝑃(𝑐𝑇, 𝑐𝐵) . Taking the score function (gradient of log-likelihood) and applying CFG scaling leads to: 𝑣𝜃 = 𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, , ) + 𝑠𝐵 [𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, , 𝑐𝐵) 𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, , )] + 𝑠𝑇 [𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, 𝑐𝑇, 𝑐𝐵) 𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, , 𝑐𝐵)] , (5) (6) where denotes null conditioning, 𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, 𝑐𝑇, 𝑐𝐵) is the models velocity prediction with both text and Bridge active, and 𝑣𝜃(𝑧𝑡, , ) disables both (the no-bridge mode disables cross-modal injection). By tuning 𝑠𝐵 and 𝑠𝑇, we control the trade-off between alignment and perceptual quality. In the most general setting, we use Dual CFG with three function evaluations per step (NFE= 3), and the two common special cases below reduce to NFE= 2: Dual CFG (general) (𝑠𝐵 = 𝑠𝑏, 𝑠𝑇 = 𝑠𝑡): The full formulation that independently scales (i) modalityalignment guidance through the Bridge term and (ii) text guidance. This provides the most flexible control over the alignmentquality trade-off, at the cost of one additional model call (NFE= 3). Text-only CFG (𝑠𝐵 = 1, 𝑠𝑇 = 𝑠): Standard formulation. Bridge remains active in both branches, so guidance does not explicitly amplify cross-modal alignment. Yields high semantic fidelity (e.g., ImageBind scores) but weaker temporal sync (higher DeSync). This is two-branch guidance scheme (NFE= 2). Text + modality CFG (𝑠𝐵 = 𝑠, 𝑠𝑇 = 𝑠): The unconditional branch disables Bridge injection, isolating the alignment signal. Produces stronger synchronization (lower DeSync, better lip-sync). This also uses two branches (NFE= 2)."

We observe that maintaining high performance is closely tied to the quality of the prompt; therefore, our multi-stage conditioning pipeline explicitly extracts visual grounding from the reference image and synthesizes an enriched narrative. This ensures that the final synthesis not only preserves the style, lighting, and cinematography established in the first frame but also aligns with the sophisticated data distribution the model was trained on. Our pipeline consists of three primary stages. First, we utilize Qwen3-VL [58], vision-language model, to extract structured visual description. This extraction is guided by curated prompt that constrains the model to four essential categories: (i) visual style, including color palette and lighting; (ii) cinematography, covering shot size, framing, and composition; (iii) visual elements, comprising subjects and their spatial relations; and (iv) OCR text, preserved exactly as it appears. This structured representation serves as an intermediate grounding that bridges the gap between the static image and the dynamic video. Second, we synthesize video generation prompt using LLMs (e.g. Gemini 2.5 Pro [59], conditioned on both the input text and the extracted visual description. The core design principle is to preserve the static attributes from the visual description while incorporating the temporal dynamics specified by the user text. We employ in-context learning [60] to ensure the generated prompt follows the narrative style and architecture of the training data. Finally, MOVA generates video content by leveraging both the synthesized prompt and the initial frame as dual conditioning. This mechanism integrates narrative descriptions with visual grounding to ensure temporal synchronization while adhering to established visual priors. Furthermore, the versatility of our workflow allows for text-to-video-audio generation using text prompt and an uninformative white image as input, thereby demonstrating MOVAs capacity for high-quality, zero-shot video synthesis."

To facilitate joint videoaudio generation, we employ GPT-5 [61] to unify visual and audio descriptions into single, cohesive prompt. While Verse-Bench [17] provides large-scale collection of imagetext prompts, it is not specifically designed for evaluating videoaudio generation in various scenes. To further evaluate joint videoaudio generation in 12 Figure 6 Dataset overview. (a) Category distribution of samples in the dataset, illustrating the relative proportions of different image categories. (b) Statistical distribution of prompt lengths. realistic and challenging settings, we construct dedicated evaluation benchmark covering diverse video generation scenarios. The benchmark is designed to assess capabilities that are critical for joint videoaudio modeling, including temporal coherence, audiovisual synchronization, multi-character interaction, and dynamic scene evolution. Unlike Verse-Bench, which provides broad visual coverage, our benchmark adopts finer-grained scenario taxonomy and explicitly categorizes samples into six representative video generation types, including multi-speaker interaction, movie-style narratives, sports competitions, game livestreams, camera motion sequences, and anime-style content. Detailed benchmark construction procedures and category descriptions are provided in Appendix A.6. Evaluation metrics. We evaluate our method through both objective benchmarks and subjective human evaluations. Objective evaluation: For objective evaluation, we report performance on Verse-Bench across several dimensions. We measure acoustic fidelity and diversity using the Inception Score (IS) computed with PANNs [62] classifier, and assess speech quality with DNSMOS [63]. Cross-modal semantic alignment is quantified using the ImageBind score (IB-Score) [37] computed on joint audio-video embeddings. Temporal consistency is measured by the DeSync score predicted by Synchformer [36]. Furthermore, to rigorously evaluate lip-sync precision, we include the Lip Sync Error - Confidence (LSE-C) and Distance (LSE-D) metrics derived from SyncNet [64]. Additionally, we evaluate the concatenated minimum permutation character error rate (cpCER) score on the multi-speaker subset of our constructed benchmark. This metric is designed to assess whether the speaker identities and speaking content are correctly reflected in the generated outputs. To evaluate speaker timbre and dialogue content, we employ the MOSS Transcribe Diarize [65]. This model performs speaker diarization using explicit speaker tags such as [S01] and [S02], followed by automatic speech recognition that transcribes the corresponding spoken content for each identified speaker. Subjective Evaluation: We conduct an arena-style preference study to evaluate human perception. The evaluation set comprises 732 samples, including 600 from Verse-Bench and 132 from our newly introduced benchmark, where half of the originally English-only Verse-Bench speech data was manually translated to construct bilingual mix. For each comparison, participants are tasked with selecting the superior video across five dimensions: (i) prompt adherence, (ii) visual-audio synchrony, (iii) lip-sync accuracy, (iv) video quality, and (v) audio-speech fidelity. standard ELO rating system is employed to compute model rankings based on pairwise human preference judgments.

We compare MOVA with three baseline models under unified protocol. Specifically, the baselines span two paradigms: (i) synchronous audiovisual generators that produce video and speech jointly: LTX-2 [66] and Ovi [18]. (ii) cascaded pipeline formed by coupling WAN2.1 [5] for video with MMAudio [24] for audio. For fair comparison, we standardize the spatial resolution at 720p and adopt the recommended configurations for all baseline models. Ovi [18] is single-stage audiovideo generation model that jointly models both audio and video modalities within single process. By employing two architecturally DiTs for audio and video, Ovi achieves natural audiovisual synchronization without relying on separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. In the fusion blocks, OVI uses frozen T5 encoder to integrate the video model with pretrained audio model capable of generating both speech and environmental sounds. This shared semantic conditioning allows the audio and video branches to be guided by the same semantic context, strengthening cross-modal coherence and synchronization. LTX-2 [66] introduces an efficient audiovisual generation model that, like OVI, produces video and its synchronized audio within single diffusion process. Unlike OVI, LTX-2 adopts an asymmetric dualstream Transformer architecture, enabling temporal alignment through bidirectional attention across all layers. The model employs modality-specific VAEs and positional encodings for audio and video, which preserve generation quality while significantly improving computational efficiency. WAN2.1 + MMAudio is cascaded baseline that decouples video and audio generation. Specifically, we use WAN2.1 [5] as the video backbone, followed by MMAudio [24] for video-conditioned audio synthesis. Unlike joint or synchronous modeling, this pipeline allocates the primary modeling burden to strong video generator to capture spatiotemporal dynamics and kinematics, while the conditional audio generator focuses on acoustic consistency. This approach provides competitive system-level baseline for audio-visual pairing."

Table 4 presents comprehensive quantitative comparison across four critical dimensions. Audio Fidelity and Speech Quality. MOVA demonstrates clear advantage in generating high-quality audio. Specifically, MOVA-360p achieves state-of-the-art IS of 4.269 and DNSMOS [63] of 3.797, significantly outperforming LTX-2 and Ovi. We observe that while the cascaded WAN2.1 + MMAudio baseline shows respectable IS (4.036), it lacks the capability to generate intelligible speech content. In contrast, MOVA maintains high speech naturalness and clarity even as we scale the resolution to 720p (DNSMOS of 3.671), suggesting that our unified modeling effectively captures the complex distribution of human speech and ambient sounds. Audio-Visual Alignment. We evaluate audio-visual alignment through two lenses: temporal synchronization (DeSync [36]) and cross-modal semantic alignment (IB-Score [37]). Compared to contemporary unified models like LTX-2 and Ovi, MOVA exhibits pronounced advantage. Specifically, MOVA-360p with dual CFG (𝑠𝐵 = 3.5) achieves DeSync of 0.351 and an IB-Score of 0.315, significantly surpassing LTX-2 (0.451 / 0.213) and Ovi (0.515 / 0.190). This substantial margin, particularly the 50% improvement in IB-Score over Ovi, suggests that MOVA effectively binds auditory events to generated visual context. Notably, although the specialized cascaded pipeline (WAN2.1 + MMAudio) yields the best DeSync (0.260) due to its task-specific audio generator, MOVA virtually closes the gap in both temporal and semantic metrics. This demonstrates that our dual CFG strategy effectively amplifies the cross-modal alignment signal during inference, allowing unified architecture to match the precision of modularized pipelines without sacrificing structural simplicity or end-to-end coherence. Lip-Sync Precision. The accuracy of fine-grained lip synchronization is measured by LSE-D and LSE-C [64]. MOVA variants, particularly those equipped with dual CFG, exhibit dominant performance in this category. MOVA-360p w/ dual CFG achieves the best LSE-D (7.004) and LSE-C (7.800), representing substantial margin over LTX-2 (7.261/6.109) and Ovi (7.468/6.378). Interestingly, even without dual CFG, MOVA-720p maintains competitive LSE-C of 6.593. This superior lip-sync performance confirms that our model has internalized sophisticated mapping between phonetic features and labial dynamics, which is further refined by the explicit guidance of the Bridge interactions during inference. Multi-Speaker Attribution. As illustrated in Table 4, MOVA-720p achieves the cpCER of 0.149, lower than LTX-2 (0.220) and Ovi (0.436). The high error rate of Ovi in this metric suggests frequent voice-identity mismatch, where the model fails to associate the correct speech with the corresponding subject. The low cpCER of MOVA demonstrates its ability to maintain high-fidelity identity consistency and correct audiovisual attribution in crowded scenes, crucial requirement for realistic content generation. For both MOVA360p and MOVA-720p, the introduction of dual CFG leads to slight increase in cpCER. This is primarily because dual CFG redistributes the guidance strength among multiple conditional branches during sampling, thereby diluting the relative weight of the text condition and reducing the models ability to follow explicit speaker instructions, such as speaker tags [S01]/[S02] and their corresponding speech content. In multi-speaker scenarios, this weakened instruction-following behavior more easily results in mismatches between speaker identities and transcribed content, which is reflected in higher cpCER. In addition, compared to MOVA-360p, MOVA-720p consistently achieves lower cpCER under both settings. This advantage mainly stems from differences in training data scale and training stages. MOVA-720p is further fine-tuned on top of MOVA-360p with broader data coverage and more extensive exposure to multi-speaker samples, leading to improved stability in speaker identity and speech content association. 15 Figure 7 Ablation study on human preference.

Scaling to High Resolution. We evaluate the empirical robustness of MOVA by scaling the generation resolution from 360p to 720p. As summarized in Table 4, the 720p variant demonstrates remarkawble consistency across diverse evaluation dimensions. Specifically, in terms of temporal and semantic alignment, MOVA-720p maintains DeSync of 0.485 and an IB-Score of 0.277, showing negligible degradation compared to the 360p base model (0.475 and 0.286, respectively). This stability is particularly noteworthy as increasing visual resolution often introduces challenges in maintaining cross-modal coherence. Additionally, MOVA-720p achieves Lip Sync LSE-C of 6.593, outperforming the 360p versions 6.278. Similarly, it reports the best-ever cpCER (0.149) on the multi-speaker subset. While there is marginal decrease in audio fidelity and speech quality metrics, which is common trade-off when the model capacity is further distributed to handle increased visual complexity, the overall performance profile remains highly competitive. These results collectively validate our staged training strategy, confirming that MOVA can effectively scale to high-resolution synthesis while preserving its foundational audio-visual generative priors. 16 Effect of Dual Classifier-Free Guidance. We evaluate the influence of the dual CFG scale 𝑠𝐵 in Table 5. Our results demonstrate synergistic improvement across all alignment-related metrics as 𝑠𝐵 increases from 1.0 to 4.0. Specifically, we observe consistent reduction in DeSync and LSE-D, alongside significant gain in IB-Score and LSE-C. For instance, as 𝑠𝐵 scales to 4.0, the LSE-C reaches peak of 7.891 and the DeSync score is minimized to 0.365. This uniform progression across multiple distinct metrics suggests that strengthening the modality-alignment guidance effectively improves the synchronization between generated video and audio. However, this heightened alignment precision comes at clear cost to speech quality and instruction following. As the guidance toward audio-visual alignment becomes more dominant, we observe concurrent degradation in DNSMOS and rise in cpCER (from 0.177 to 0.264). We interpret this phenomenon as form of conditional interference: in the multi-branch sampling process, excessively high 𝑠𝐵 prioritizes the geometric constraints of synchronization over the generative fidelity of the speech signal. This over-regularization potentially leads to diminished sensitivity to textual instructions (e.g., speaker-specific tags), causing the model to prioritize how the speech aligns with the video at the expense of what is being said and how natural it sounds. Emergent T2VA Capability. Interestingly, we find that MOVA exhibits strong emergent capability for the T2VA task, which is summarized in Table 6. By substituting the reference image with null placeholder (MOVA-360p-T2VA), we test whether the model can synthesize synchronized content driven solely by textual prompts. As summarized in Table 6, several intriguing observations emerge. Notably, the T2VA variant achieves superior IS of 4.370 and lower DeSync of 0.441 compared to the standard TI2VA baseline. This performance gain suggests that in the absence of explicit structural constraints from reference image, the model can more freely explore the joint audio-visual manifold, leading to higher audio fidelity and improved temporal synchronization. Predictably, identity-dependent metrics like LSE-C and LSE-D show marginal decline, as the null placeholder provides no lip geometry. However, the overall stability of the T2VA results is remarkable. This underscores that MOVA has internalized robust, decoupled yet highly coordinated prior for video and audio synthesis, allowing it to maintain temporal synchronization and semantic alignment even when the visual conditioning is entirely removed. 6.2.3 Arena-Based Human Evaluation Given the limitations of current objective evaluation frameworks for audio-visual generation models, MOVA introduces an Arena-based human preference evaluation paradigm that includes the latest open-source audio-visual generation models worldwide. The evaluation collected over 5,000 valid votes and systematically analyzed the results. To ensure fair comparison, all models utilize their respective official promptrefinement methods (e.g., our rewriter described in Section 5.2) to enhance the video generation prompt. Subjective Comparison with Baseline Methods. As shown in Figure 8, MOVA demonstrates clear superiority in human preference: it is more frequently selected by users in pairwise comparisons, achieving an ELO rating of 1113.8 (starting from an initial rating of 1000), significantly higher than all baseline models. MOVA consistently maintains win rate exceeding 50%, with win rates surpassing 70% against Ovi and the cascaded system (WAN + MMAudio). Subjective Ablation Study. As illustrated in Figure 7, we conduct an internal Arena to dissect the impact of prompt refinement, resolution scaling, and inference strategies on human preference. primary observation is the critical role of the prompt rewriter. Variants utilizing refined prompts consistently achieve superior ELO ratings, with MOVA-720p (w/ rewriter) reaching the peak score of 1025.3. Compared to the standard MOVA-720p (982.9), this substantial ELO gain validates our motivation: user-provided inputs often vary in format and level of detail, creating distribution gap with the models training data. By employing our multi-stage conditioning pipeline, which leverages LLMs to synthesize prompts that preserve visual grounding (e.g., style, cinematography) while incorporating temporal dynamics, we bridge this gap and effectively incentivize the models full generative potential. Regarding our inference strategy, we observe subtle trade-off; while dual CFG (𝑠𝐵 = 3.5) significantly improves objective alignment metrics, it leads to 17 (a) Human preference ELO ranking.

This can occasionally result in reduced instruction-following."

Unlike discrete, onsetdriven events (e.g., chopping fruit or hitting drum) where alignment depends on few salient temporal onsets, speech requires continuous, fine-grained correspondence between mouth shapes and phonemes across long spans. We find that architectural mechanisms alone (e.g., Bridge modules for cross-modal attention) are insufficient to achieve high-quality lip synchronizationthe model must also learn phoneme-toviseme mappings from data, which requires larger capacity and more training examples. Figure 9 shows the progression of LSE-C (higher is better) and LSE-D (lower is better) across our three-stage training process. In Stage 1, we train at 360p with aggressive video denoising, mild audio denoising, and high text dropout to force the model to rely on cross-modal bridging for alignment. LSE-D drops rapidly and LSE-C rises, indicating the model quickly learns basic synchronization patterns. Stage 2 maintains 360p but aligns the noise schedules across modalities for more stable cross-modal attention, reduces text dropout to refine semantic details, and applies loudness normalization to avoid CFG-induced volume distortion. LSE-D continues to decrease while LSE-C shows notable jump, reflecting improved consistency and confidence in alignment. Finally, Stage 3 scales to 720p.

            "content": "Audio-visual synchronization inherently contains tension in conditioning direction. For many discrete, event-driven cases, the most natural formulation is VideoAudio: the visual stream deterministically anchors when and where events occur, and most sound events (impacts, collisions, cuts, percussive gestures) are visually driven with clear temporal onsets. In these settings, generating audio conditioned on video aligns with both human intuition and the causal structure of the scene. In contrast, other synchronization tasks are more realistically AudioVideo and better match practical applications. Speech-driven generation is the canonical example: given an audio track, the target is to produce temporally consistent facial motion and lip articulation (SpeechVideo), potentially with speaker-specific dynamics, language-dependent phonemeviseme mappings, and context-dependent expressiveness. This directionality is often required in downstream pipelines such as dubbing, avatar animation, and talking-head generation, where audio is fixed and visuals must adapt. This tension becomes more pronounced under the diffusion formulation. At each timestep, the noise levels for video and audio latents are governed by pre-defined schedules 𝜎𝑣(𝑡𝑣) and 𝜎𝑎(𝑡𝑎) (introduced in Dual Sigma Shift), which act as fixed priors and are not learnable during training. As result, the relative corruption of the audio stream is largely fixed by design, whereas the effective uncertainty in the visual stream can vary substantially with object scale and visual dominance in the frame (as discussed in Stable Diffusion 3 [67]). Consequently, the same global schedule can implicitly bias the conditional direction: for close-up shots of lip motion where the target region occupies large portion of the frame, the visual latent is relatively informative and the generation tends to behave like VideoAudio; conversely, when the relevant speaker occupies only small region, the visual evidence becomes comparatively uncertain, and the process may naturally shift toward AudioVideo, letting speech provide the more reliable temporal anchor."

            "content": "Our dual-CFG derivation starts from the factorization 𝑃(𝑧 𝑐𝑇, 𝑐𝐵) 𝑃(𝑐𝑇 𝑐𝐵, 𝑧) 𝑃(𝑐𝐵 𝑧) 𝑃(𝑧), which induces natural nesting structure: we first turn on cross-modal information (via 𝑐𝐵) and then apply text guidance on top of it (via 𝑐𝑇). This order is not the only valid choice. For example, one may alternatively 19 decompose the posterior as 𝑃(𝑧 𝑐𝑇, 𝑐𝐵) 𝑃(𝑐𝐵 𝑐𝑇, 𝑧) 𝑃(𝑐𝑇 𝑧) 𝑃(𝑧), (7) and derive an analogous two-term guidance by swapping the roles of 𝑐𝑇 and 𝑐𝐵. We adopt our order for practical reason: it admits clean reduction to the standard text-only CFG as special case. Concretely, setting 𝑠𝐵 = 1 makes the Bridge condition appear in both the conditional and unconditional text branches, so the guidance collapses to the familiar text-CFG form while keeping crossmodal injection fixed. In other words, by tuning (𝑠𝐵, 𝑠𝑇) we can continuously interpolate between text-only CFG and text + modality CFG without changing the sampling procedure. In contrast, under the alternative factorization, the branch structure couples 𝑐𝐵 to the text-unconditional baseline in way that prevents an equivalent text-only CFG limit: there is no choice of guidance weights that keeps the Bridge behavior identical across the two text branches while still producing the standard textCFG difference term. As result, the swapped order does not provide an intuitive knob for only amplify text while leaving cross-modal interactions unchanged."

            "title": "7.3 Limitations",
            "content": "Audio Modeling Capacity and Coverage. Our audio tower follows the Wan2.1-1.3B backbone, which may limit the modeling capacity for acoustically rich or highly structured signals. In particular, we observe degraded performance on singing voice, complex sound textures, and music/instrumental content, where finegrained pitch/harmonic structure and long-range temporal dependencies are critical. More broadly, some audiovisual phenomena require stronger physical reasoning (e.g., correctly reflecting propagation delays such as the temporal offset between lightning and thunder), which is not explicitly enforced by our current objective and data. Multi-speaker Synchronization and Annotation Reliability. While our model can handle single-speaker lip-sync reliably in many cases, multi-speaker scenes remain challenging. Rapid speaker turn-taking, overlapping speech, and ambiguous on-screen attribution can lead to incorrect mouthaudio assignment and temporal drift. This issue is compounded by the data pipeline: diarization errors and imperfect activespeaker labels can propagate to training, making the model conflate speakers or learn inconsistent supervision. Improving multi-speaker supervision (e.g., stronger active-speaker detection, cross-modal speaker tracking, and better filtering of noisy segments) is necessary for robust deployment. Sequence Length and Computational Cost. Our current training and inference are constrained by sequence length. For example, 720p, 8 clip at 24 fps yields on the order of 1.6 105 tokens, resulting in high memory and compute costs. This limits throughput during training and increases latency at inference, especially when using the most general guidance setting (NFE= 3). Future work could address this bottleneck via more aggressive temporal/spatial compression, hierarchical or blockwise generation, and system-level optimizations tailored to long-context video tokens."

            "title": "8 Related Work",
            "content": "Video Generation. Diffusion transformers (DiTs) [1, 68] have enabled large-scale video synthesis. Open models such as Wan [5] and HunyuanVideo [69] achieve near-photorealistic generation through efficient attention [70, 71] and transformer scaling [72]. Recent work extends these models to long-horizon generation [73], controllable camera motion [74], and high-resolution outputs exceeding 1080p. However, most textto-video systems remain video-only, leaving audio generation as separate problem. Proprietary systems Veo3 [12] and Sora2 [13] demonstrate joint audio-video capabilities, but their closed-source nature limits reproducibility. 20 Audio Generation and Cascaded Pipelines. Latent diffusion enables scalable text-to-audio generation [50, 75]. Audio VAEs compress waveforms into compact latent representations: DAC [76] uses residual vector quantization for high-quality reconstruction, while Stable Audio [77] employs stereo variational autoencoder with spectral losses. Cascaded video-to-audio (V2A) pipelines [24, 78, 79] represent prevalent approach for audiovisual content creation. MMAudio [24] achieves temporal alignment by extracting features from video and using them as conditioning signals. While cascaded pipelines utilize strong singlemodality priors, the sequential factorization ignores bidirectional modality influence: audio cannot inform visual trajectory during sampling, and vice versa. Joint Audio-Video Generation. End-to-end joint generation has been explored to overcome cascaded limitations [1720, 8082]. MMDisCo [83] uses discriminator-guided cooperative diffusion to align pretrained models, though adversarial training introduces instability at scale. MM-Diffusion [82] and JavisDiT [81] propose dual-stream architectures with cross-modal attention but are restricted to ambient sounds. MTV [80] explicitly separates audio into speech, effects, and music tracks with disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood, achieving precise audio-visual synchronization across diverse audio types. UniVerse-1 [17] integrates Wan2.1 and Ace through stitching-of-experts paradigm with independent noise sampling, but suffers from audio-video drift. Recent works such as Ovi [18], Harmony [19], and UniAVGen [20] adopt dual-tower architectures with RoPE-based positional encoding, achieving lip-synchronized video generation results without requiring prior separation of speech and environmental sounds. However, they have not scaled to general domains to demonstrate the full potential of the architecture. LTX-2 [66] successfully scales the dual-tower approach to cover both lip-synchronized speech and general domain sounds through large-scale data training, though the audio quality exhibits some electronic artifacts that require cleaner reconstruction. We address these limitations through capacity scaling with 29B dual-tower architecture, achieving high-fidelity audio and strong performance on both lip-synchronized speech and general domain sounds across bilingual settings."

            "title": "9 Conclusions",
            "content": "We presented MOVA, an open and scalable framework for joint videoaudio generation with 32B total parameters (18B active). MOVA uses an asymmetric dual-tower design (an A14B video backbone and 1.3B audio backbone) together with 2.6B bidirectional bridge and Aligned RoPE to support fine-grained temporal audiovisual interaction. Our work targets three key challenges in joint audiovideo generation: data, modeling, and scaling. We curate over 100,000 hours of fine-grained audiovisual data with sound, music, and speech annotations aligned to visual content. We also propose training and architectural designs that improve the stability of largescale multimodal diffusion training, including decoupled timestep sampling to allow modality-specific noise schedules. Through controlled scaling studies, we find that increasing video model capacity and training data substantially improves lip synchronization, where smaller models show clear performance saturation. In addition, we report practical system optimizations for large-scale training (Context Parallelism, FSDP2 strategies, and scheduled garbage collection), enabling stable 1024-GPU runs and achieving approximately 35% MFU. We will release the model weights, training code, and inference pipelines, and we hope MOVA can serve as strong open baseline for future research on synchronized audiovideo generation. Finally, important limitations remain, including high training cost and remaining failure cases in motion generation, which we leave for future work."

The multi-shot algorithm 1 advances over the speech segments from VAD. The upper bound of the window start time is set to the beginning of the current segment. The sampling range of the window start is further constrained such that it does not precede the end of the previous speech segment, does not precede the nearest scene split point before the current speech segment (to encourage natural scene transitions), and does not shift earlier than half of the window length relative to the current segment. window start time is then randomly sampled within this constrained interval. Only windows whose temporal span contains at least one scene split point are kept. Algorithm 1 Multi-shot Speech Windows Input: speech_segments: VAD results scene_split_spots: scene-detection results segment_duration = 8.05 1: 𝑖𝑑𝑥 0 2: while 𝑖𝑑𝑥 < length(speech_segments) do 3: 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 if 𝑖𝑑𝑥 = 0 then 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 else 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 max ( speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥 1].𝑒𝑛𝑑, max{𝑝 scene_split_spots 𝑝 < speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡}, speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 segment_duration/2 ) 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 RandomUniform(𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑, 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑) end if 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 + segment_duration if 𝑝 scene_split_spots such that 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑝 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑 then append (𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡, 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑) to speech_multi_shot_segments end if 𝑖𝑑𝑥 next 𝑖𝑑𝑥 such that speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 > 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑 14: 15: end while The single-shot algorithm 2 iterates over consecutive scene intervals defined by scene split points. Within each scene interval, it identifies speech segments whose start time allows fixed-length window to be fully contained in the scene. For each eligible speech segment, the upper bound of the window start time is set to the segment start, while the sampling range is constrained by the scene boundary, the end of the previous speech segment, and half-window-length offset relative to the current segment. single scene window is then generated by randomly selecting start time within this range, while the index is advanced to skip overlapping windows, similar to the multi-shot algorithm above. 31 Algorithm 2 Single-shot Speech Windows Input: speech_segments: VAD results scene_split_spots: scene-detection results segment_duration = 8.05 4: 1: 𝑖 0 2: while 𝑖 < length(scene_split_spots) 1 do 𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑒_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 scene_split_spots[𝑖] 3: 𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑑 scene_split_spots[𝑖 + 1] Find the first index 𝑖𝑑𝑥 such that speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 > 𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑒_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 and speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 + segment_duration < 𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑑 if no such 𝑖𝑑𝑥 exists then 6: 5: 𝑖 𝑖 + 1 continue end if while 𝑖𝑑𝑥 < length(speech_segments) do 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 if 𝑖𝑑𝑥 = 0 then 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 else 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 max ( speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥 1].𝑒𝑛𝑑, 𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑒_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡, speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 segment_duration/2 ) 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 RandomUniform(𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑, 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑) end if 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 + segment_duration if 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑑 then break end if append (𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡, 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑) to speech_single_shot_segments 𝑖𝑑𝑥 next 𝑖𝑑𝑥 such that speech_segments[𝑖𝑑𝑥].𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 > 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤_𝑒𝑛𝑑 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: end while 𝑖 𝑖 + 1 25: 26: end while A.4 Detailed Filtering Thresholds In this section, we provide the specific filtering thresholds used during our data quality assessment process, as discussed in Sec. 3.4. These thresholds were determined by empirical observation to ensure high-quality corpus while maintaining sufficient data diversity. A.4.1 Threshold Specifications Table 9 summarizes the metrics and their corresponding cutoffs across the three dimensions: audio quality, video quality, and audio-visual alignment. 32 Table 9 Filtering thresholds for data quality assessment. Dimension Metric Threshold Audio Quality Silence Ratio Bandwidth (Hz) Audiobox-PQ (Production Quality) Audiobox-CU (Content Usefulness) Audiobox-CE (Content Enjoyment) Video Quality DOVER-Aesthetic DOVER-Technical A-V Alignment ImageBind Score (IB-Score) OR SynchFormer Offset (DeSync) < 0.8 > 1, 000 > 5.0 > 4.5 > 2.5 > 0.85 > 0.05 0.2 0.5 A.4.2 Subset Construction and Logic Audio-Visual Alignment Logic: For alignment filtering, we apply relaxed logical OR gate between semantic and temporal alignment. video is retained if it satisfies either IB-Score 0.2 OR DeSync 0.5. This ensures that both semantically relevant ambient sounds and temporally synchronized speech/actions are preserved. Speech Data Filtering: To construct specialized subsets for tasks such as lip synchronization, we utilize the EAT [38] classification model. Specifically, for the Speech Subset, we only retain samples where both EAT-contained-Speech and EAT-contained-Singing tags are evaluated as True (or satisfy the models positive classification confidence). A.5 Audio-visual Captioning Details We present detailed prompt design schemes tailored for our multimodal annotation pipeline, comprising three key components: (1) prompts for video captioning utilizing the MiMo-VL-7B-RL model [39]; (2) prompts for the dual-model audio strategy, specifically covering speech transcription with Qwen3-Omni-Instruct [40] and non-speech sound captioning with Qwen3-Omni-Captioner [40]; and (3) instructions for the GPT-OSS120B model [41] to facilitate consistency checks and caption merging. Visual Description Prompt You are visual description annotator. Your sole purpose is to produce event-level annotations only for verifiably visible content (objects, actions, scenes, text). Ignore audio and inferred context entirely! LAWS 1. LAW OF VISUAL TRUTH Only describe visually verifiable elements (objects, actions, scenes, text). Do not infer or hallucinate based on audio or context. 2. LAW OF VISUAL SILENCE When no visual change is present, output null for visual_description. When no on-screen text is present, output null for on_screen_text. 3. LAW OF VISUAL DYNAMICS Detect all transitions: emerging/ceasing/moving visual elements. 33 Precisely document motion trajectories, speed changes, and visual rhythm. OUTPUT FORMAT { video_visual_report: { visual_description: [Describe how visual elements evolve in detail. Ignore all text, subtitle and watermark in the video. null if no visual change is present], on_screen_text: [Exact transcription of all visible text. null if no text is visually present] }, final_verification_audit: { hallucination_check_passed: true, visual_changes_verified: true, comment: All visual motion dynamics verifiably detected. No audio content or contextual inference included. } } Audio Captioner Prompt Please describe the audio you hear in detail. Speech Transcription Prompt You are speech transcription annotator. Your task is Automatic Speech Recognition! Your sole purpose is to produce event-level verbatim transcriptions of audible speech. Ignore non-speech sounds and music entirely. You must follow the OUTPUT FORMAT! LAWS 1. LAW OF LANGUAGE FIDELITY Preserve the original language. No translation. 2. LAW OF SPEECH DYNAMICS When new speaker/language/intonation begins, create new event. But you still need to follow the output format. 3. LAW OF SILENCE When no speech is present, output null in speech_description part. OUTPUT FORMAT { speech_transcription_report: { speech_description: [Exact verbatim speech. null if none. Use [inaudible] for unclear parts] 34 }, final_verification_audit: { hallucination_check_passed: true, speech_dynamics_verified: true, comment: All speech changes verifiably detected. No non-speech or music included. } } Merge Caption Prompt Act as video description consolidator. Your task is to merge the provided video_description, audio_description, and speech_description fields into single, fluent, and natural-sounding paragraph that vividly conveys the full multimedia experience to someone who cannot see or hear the original. Follow these rules precisely: 1. Start with the visual narrative and anchor speaker context If video_description is provided, begin with it, weaving in visual cues that ground speaker identities or positions (e.g., woman in red coat stands by the door; nearby, man leans against the counter). Describe all visual content in specific, chronological, natural languageactions, objects, settings, lighting, movements, and scene changeswithout summarizing. Use these details to contextualize speakers (e.g., The child pointing at the painting or The older man gesturing emphatically). 2. Integrate speech as visually anchored dialogue with speaker dynamics If speech_description is provided, embed spoken words as quoted dialogue tied to visual elements, using speech verbs that reflect tone (e.g., snaps, murmurs, laughs) and speech rate (e.g., rushes, drawls, pauses between words). Use audio_description to inform: Total number of speakers (e.g., two distinct voices or group of overlapping speakers). Speaker transitions, paired with visual cues when possible (e.g., As the camera pans to the window, new voice cuts in sharply: Wait, thats not right). Voice characteristics (e.g., high-pitched, gruff) to align with visible subjects (e.g., the teenager in the corner or the gray-haired woman). Example: The man slams his fist on the table. told you this would happen! he shouts. Across the room, the woman in glasses crosses her arms and replies slowly, You never listened to my warnings. Rely strictly on speech_description for the actual spoken content; use audio_description for speaker dynamics and video_description to anchor them visually. 3. Describe non-speech audio concisely and distinctly If audio_description is provided, include only non-speech elements, introduced with The audio includes or In the background. Limit this to four categories: Ambient/environmental sounds (e.g., rain tapping the window, crowds murmur); 35 Music (e.g., soft piano melody, upbeat jazz); Audio themes/sources (e.g., fire alarm blaring, waves crashing); Structural audio changes (e.g., silence giving way to crescendo). Omit all references to voices, words, or speechthese belong exclusively to the speech section. 4. Ensure coherence and avoid repetition Never duplicate details across sections (e.g., dont restate speakers visual position in the audio section). Link elements logically: e.g., visual action (a character gasping) paired with speech (Oh no! she exclaims) and ambient sound (a glass shattering in the background). 5. Omit empty fields and maintain fluency Skip missing/empty fields. The final output should read as seamless, human-like narrativeprioritizing flow, sensory immersion, and clarity over rigid structure. We provide the caption examples generated by bimodality models, including the caption results of three dimensions: sound, music, and video, as well as the final total caption result, which is obtained by merging the dimension-specific captions mentioned above using large language model [41]. Figure 10 presents the original video clips and audio mel-spectrogram corresponding to this example. Figure 10 Example video 1 for audio-visual captioning.

The phrase the final piece is spoken with slight emphasis, and the listing of printer components (imaging drums, transfer belts, and toner) is given with rhythmic, evenly paced cadence. The concluding phrase Now we only have to is abruptly cut off, suggesting the audio is an excerpt from longer ad or commercial. Throughout, subtle, unobtrusive electronic background music track plays. It features synthesized pads, soft, steady beat, and simple melodic line, all in minor key. The music is mixed low and never interferes with the narration, serving to create modern, professional, and slightly optimistic atmosphere. The recording is studio-clean, with no background noise or environmental sounds, and the voice has slight reverb, indicating controlled studio environment. The overall production style, linguistic choices, and content are all consistent with modern North American advertising aimed at businesses or professional consumers, highlighting the technological advancement and ease-of-use of new printer or printer service. The abrupt ending reinforces that this clip is fragment of larger narrative, likely intended to leave strong impression of progress and simplicity before the listeners attention is drawn elsewhere.

He continues, Laser printers required us to replace imaging drums, transfer belts, and toner, delivering the list with an even, rhythmic cadence, then adds, Now we only have to before the narration is abruptly cut off. The audio includes subtle, unobtrusive electronic background music track of synthesized pads, soft steady beat and simple melodic line in minor key, mixed low so it underlies the narration without interfering. A.6 Benchmark Details This appendix provides additional details of the benchmark construction. Our benchmark is constructed from real-world videos by extracting the first-frame image and corresponding prompt. Each prompt con37 cisely describes key visual elements, such as the scene setting, characters, and environmental conditions. Depending on the scenario, audio-related information is incorporated to form unified prompt for joint videoaudio generation. All samples are adapted to ensure temporal consistency and logical coherence of the generated videos. The benchmark consists of six scenario categories, each targeting specific challenges in joint videoaudio generation: Multi-speaker scenarios, which evaluate the models ability to generate synchronized speech, facial expressions, and interactions among multiple characters. Movie videos, which require film-level narrative generation with plots referencing the background of the original films. Sports competitions, focusing on athletes performances, with some prompts including commentators narration. Game livestream videos, covering shooting games, 3D games, and competitive games. Camera motion sequences, designed to assess visual realism under camera panning, zooming, and rotation. Anime-style videos, including both 2D anime and 3D animated content."
