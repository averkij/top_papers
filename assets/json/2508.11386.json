            "content": "Recent efforts to improve the test-time performance of language models have shown significant promise [1, 2, 3, 4]. These approaches, particularly those that target enhancements of so-called reasoning capabilities via chain-of-thought prompting [5], have enabled relatively small-scale models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 distilled models [6] or s1 [7]) to achieve results that are comparable to those of frontier models (e.g., OpenAIs offerings [8]), in specific tasks. In parallel, work that has focused on improving the factuality and verifiability of the output of LLMs through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) strategies has presented clear opportunities to reduce hallucinations [9, 10, 11], in particular when dealing with the complexities of specific domains of knowledge [12, 13]. The successful integration of reasoning and RAG is now widely available in tools like ChatGPT and Gemini. Given user query, these systems can, for instance, first reason about the query and then decide to take an actionsuch as performing web search or querying tool like Google Mapsbefore returning final answer. This form of reasoning and tool use is characteristic of emerging agentic AI systems [14, 15, 16]. Alternatively, the system may begin by retrieving documents relevant to the user query and then reason over the collected evidence before responding. This second approachretrieval followed by reasoningwill be the focus of this technical report. While the combination of retrieval and reasoning has significantly enhanced the performance of frontier language models in general-purpose applications, such approaches encounter clear limitations in scenarios where users are unwilling or unable to share data with external entitiesparticularly in domains involving sensitive or private information. Even if the training data of model is publicly available, the prompts posed by users can often contain highly proprietary or sensitive information which cannot cross organisational or national boundaries. In these cases, it becomes necessary to deploy language models on local infrastructure, potentially within secure or air-gapped environments. To address such requirements, recent years have seen steady progress in the development of openly available large language models (e.g., [17, 18, 19]) alongside open-source frameworks for retrieval augmented generation1. More recently, small-scale reasoning models have also begun to emerge [6, 7]. Nonetheless, the effective integration of reasoning capabilities for interpreting retrieved evidenceparticularly within the constraints of lightweight or locally deployable modelsremains an open research challenge. While some recent work such as ReAct [20], REPLUG [21], and MemGPT [22] explore hybrid architectures for strongly integrating LLM reasoning with document retrieval, they are mostly in large, non-local model settings. To address these limitations, this technical report presents an approach for effectively combining reasoning and retrieval augmented generation within single, 1See for instance https://www.llamaindex.ai/ and https://www.langchain.com/. 2 lean language model. Furthermore, we integrate this fine-tuned model into an interactive conversational system to demonstrate its applicability in downstream tasks. The resulting system is particularly well-suited for applications involving complex queries over private, domain-specific knowledge bases. In such settings, the reasoning component facilitates the interpretation and decomposition of intricate queries, while the retrieval mechanism constrains the model to verifiable information, thereby mitigating the risk of hallucinated responses. The focus on private and sensitive domains motivated our emphasis on lean language models that can be feasibly fine-tuned and deployed by small organizations or government departments, particularly in compute-constrained or secure environments. The report is structured as follows. We begin with an overview of test-time scaling strategies and related work relevant to the task. This is followed by detailed description of our system architecture, including implementation choices and practical guidance for reproducibility, supported by references to the accompanying codebase. We then demonstrate the application of our approach to representative domain-specific knowledge basethe NHS A-to-Z condition webpages2using set of queries that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. The report concludes with discussion of potential future enhancements. An open-source implementation of our method is available via GitHub,3 enabling practitioners to apply the system to broad range of problems involving domain-specific question answering that combines retrieval with structured reasoning."

            "title": "2.1 Test-time scaling",
            "content": "The core concept of test-time scaling involves enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by increasing computational resources during inference rather than during pre-training. Prior work has demonstrated that this strategy can lead to improved performance more efficiently than increasing compute during the pretraining phase itself [2, 4]. In practice, test-time scaling refers to deploying inferencetime strategies that leverage additional sampling, computation, or prompt engineering to boost the capabilities of fixed modelwithout modifying its parameters through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. One widely used class of test-time scaling methods is parallel generation, where model generates multiple candidate responses and then aggregates them through 2Publicly available at https://www.nhs.uk/health-a-to-z/conditions/ 3https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/t0-1 3 selection mechanisms such as majority voting [3], self-consistency [23], or best-ofN sampling [24]. These techniques improve robustness and factual accuracy by exploiting diversity in the models outputs, with selection based on heuristics or learned reward functions. Other common strategies such as beam search [25] and Monte Carlo tree search [26], which maintains multiple high-probability continuations of sequence in parallel to explore more optimal generations. While such approaches typically improve likelihood, they may reduce diversity, in contrast to sampling-based methods. complementary family of approaches is known as sequential scaling, which involves increasing the number of intermediate reasoning steps the model takes before arriving at final answer. The most prominent example is chain-of-thought prompting [5], in which models are guided to produce intermediate reasoning steps that improve performance on complex tasks. This trend has contributed to broader anthropomorphisation of model behaviour, often described in terms of reasoning [27]. Extensions such as tree-of-thought prompting generalise this idea by exploring multiple reasoning paths in branching structure, potentially with scoring and pruning mechanisms applied to select the most promising trajectory. More advanced test-time scaling methods differ in whether they assume access to verifier model or module that can score, rerank, or validate outputs. In verifier-free settings, selection relies on internal model heuristics (e.g., majority vote, self-consistency), while verifier-assisted setups may use external reward models, classifiers, or even humans to evaluate and select responses, leading to higher precision but increased complexity. Recent models such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero [6] have pushed this frontier by training LLMs via reinforcement learning to produce structured reasoning paths, using formatting conventions (e.g., enclosing thoughts in <think> tags) to aid downstream reasoning alignment. While this model demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, it also exhibited practical limitations, such as decreased readability and occasional mixing of languages. To mitigate these challenges, DeepSeek-R1 incorporated small quantity of high-quality cold start data prior to reinforcement learning (RL). This dataset comprised carefully curated examples, most notably chain-of-thought demonstrations, designed to stabilise early training and improve the coherence of generated outputs. DeepSeek-R1 was then trained via two-stage RL procedure: the first stage targeted improvements in reasoning ability, while the second focused on aligning model outputs with human preferences, thereby enhancing readability and reducing incoherent completions. This multi-phase training strategy enabled DeepSeek-R1 to achieve performance on par with OpenAIs o1 model across range of reasoning benchmarks. While there has been considerable effort in the last two years in developing large variety of reasoning models, evaluation of such models is still in most cases restricted to series of widely known mathematics and coding benchmarks, giving the impression to the reader that reasoning for language modelling actually only"

However, downstream applications of reasoning models can also focus on planning and decision making, where generated reasoning traces could provide an insight into the models strategy, notwithstanding the pitfalls of being overly reliant on chain-of-thought as an explanation of models answers [29, 30, 31, 32]."

            "title": "2.2 Retrieval augmented generation",
            "content": "A retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system has two key components (illustrated in Figure 1): 1. retriever which retrieves information from some external memory sources. This also involves pre-processing step to index the knowledge base. 2. generator (often an LLM) which generates response based on the retrieved information. RAG enables LLMs to retrieve relevant document chunks from external knowledge bases, often through semantic similarity and embedding based approaches [10]. By utilising an external knowledge base, RAG enables model to ground its responses in the relevant context, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning, effectively helping it generate relevant responses and reducing hallucinations [9]. The success of RAG system heavily depends on the quality of its retriever and its role is to provide the LLM with information from the external database that is most relevant to the query. The retriever has two core functions: 1. Indexing: pre-processing and chunking the data so that data can be retrieved quickly. 4See for Leaderboard. instance https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_ 2. Querying: retrieving data relevant to given query. Although external data sources may take various formsincluding multimodal data (e.g., images, video, audio), tabular datasets, and structured knowledge graphs, this report focuses exclusively on the case where the external memory consists of corpus of textual documents. In such settings, document chunking is typically required to divide each document into smaller, manageable segments that conform to the context window limitations of both the embedding model used in retrieval and the language model used for generation. common approach is to segment documents based on predefined units such as characters, paragraphs, or token sequences derived from specific tokenizer. Overlapping chunks are often employed to reduce the risk of splitting semantically important content across boundaries. To support retrieval in this context, we adopt an embedding-based approach that leverages vector store: specialised data structure designed for efficient indexing and retrieval of items based on their vector representations, or embeddings. These embeddings are intended to capture the semantic content of the input text and are used to represent the individual document chunks. At query time, the system embeds the input query into the same vector space and performs similarity search against the stored document embeddings to identify the most semantically relevant passages. Common similarity metrics include Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, the latter measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors and often preferred for its scale-invariance. More advanced techniques have been developed to improve relevance and contextual alignment between retrieved content and the user query. One such approach is contextual retrieval [33], in which short, explanatory contexts are generated and prepended to each document chunk before embedding and indexing, preserving important contextual information that would otherwise be lost when documents are split into smaller pieces. Furthermore, the retrieval process can also be conditioned not only on the query itself but also on additional context, such as preceding dialogue turns or the evolving state of task [34, 35]. This enables the retriever to return passages that are better aligned with the intent and discourse structure of the interaction. Additionally, reranking mechanisms are often employed to refine the initial retrieval outputs [36]. These rerankers, typically implemented as lightweight neural models or cross-encoders, score candidate set of retrieved passages more precisely by jointly considering the query and each document chunk, allowing for improved selection of the most informative context to pass to the generator. Recent work has also explored retriever-generator co-training, where both components are trained jointly or iteratively in closed loop [37]. This can lead to tighter coupling between retrieval and generation, with the retriever learning to prioritize passages that the generator can most effectively condition on for producing accurate and coherent responses. Moreover, multi-hop retrieval extends the RAG paradigm by chaining multiple retrieval steps, allowing the system to aggregate evidence from disparate sources across documents [38]. Collectively, these techniques move in the direction of retrieval-aware reasoning, where the retrieval process is optimized not just for relevance, but also for supporting structured inference and faithful generation."

            "title": "2.3 Lean language models",
            "content": "The increasing size of frontier language models has led to shift in natural language processing (NLP) research, where these models are often accessed as services via dedicated APIs [39, 40]. This model-as-a-service approach is sometimes the only available option, particularly for closed models such as those provided by OpenAI. When large-scale open models are released, such as the 405B (405 billion parameters) Llama 3.1 [41] or the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model [6], the computational demands for running them, even just for inference, are often prohibitive for many research groups and small organisations. As result, cloud-based LLM endpoints, such as those offered by Microsoft Azure, provide practical and accessible way to interact with these models. However, this approach is not suitable in contexts where data is private or sensitive and must remain on-premises. In such cases, sending data to third-party APIs is not viable option. This motivates the development and deployment of small-scale language models, designed to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive performance. Techniques such as quantisation [42], pruning [43], and knowledge distillation [44, 45] are commonly employed to reduce model size and computational requirements. In particular, knowledge distillation, where smaller student model is trained to replicate the behaviour of larger teacher model, has shown lot of potential for both reducing the size of an LLM while maintaining overall good performance. For instance, Gemma 2 models [46], available in sizes ranging from 2 billion to 27 billion parameters, are designed for efficient natural language understanding and generation tasks. While the larger variants are trained from scratch, the smaller variants, such as the 2B and 9B models, utilise knowledge distillation from the larger 27B model to achieve competitive performance. These strategies are also adopted when the purpose is to obtain small-scale versions of reasoning models [47]. Knowledge distillation has been used, for instance, by the DeepSeek team [6] to create distilled versions of their DeekSeek-R1 model, adopting Qwen and Llama as starting LLMs and employing 800k samples. An alternative strategy is the one presented by the s1 team [7], where the authors fine-tuned 32B Qwen models on only one thousand reasoning traces (initially from Gemini Flash Thinking in s1, and then from DeepSeek in s1.1), highlighting the importance of curating small set of selected training data versus large-scale pool of more noisy examples. These strategies have paved the way for lean language models, as natural counter-point to massive trillion-parameter frontier models. The advantages of small-footprint language models have been widely acknowledged, particularly in the context of agentic systems [48, 49]. The development of novel algorithmic innovations to create highly capable lean models, through strategies such as test-time scaling, is very active area of research. Building on top of this previous work, in this technical report we focus on how we can enhance in-domain reasoning capabilities on small-scale language model, which would be provided with series of documents to address user query."

            "content": "In this technical report, we present our approach to fine-tuning lean reasoning model within setup that is accessible to relatively small-scale research labs and industry teams, one that does not depend on large-scale infrastructure. We followed the configuration described in s1 [7] as closely as possible and used 16 NVIDIA A100 80 GB GPUs for the largest models. This hardware configuration was required to train the 32B model, primarily due to the large context window employed during training (block size = 32 768 tokens). Such long context window is needed to make sure the model would be able to rely on (often long5) reasoning traces, as well as retrieved documents, to produce an answer to user query. The A100 80 GB GPUs offer memory and performance characteristics close enough to the NVIDIA H100s used in the s1 study, making them viable alternative for similar workloads. We conducted experiments on Microsoft Azure and two UK-based academic high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, Baskerville6 and IsambardAI7 [50], evaluating various configurations. Additionally, we leveraged Microsoft Azures AI Foundry, suite of tools and APIs designed to streamline integration with foundation models. Microsoft Azure. We utilised two virtual machines of type Standard ND96amsr A100 v4, each providing: 96 vCPUs and 1800 GB of system memory 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs per VM 5Note that one of the key methodological findings of s1 is the benefit of extending the reasoning process by forcing its continuation, instead of allowing the model to end its generation and output an answer. 6https://www.baskerville.ac.uk/ 7https://docs.isambard.ac.uk/ 8 These VMs offered excellent memory utilisation for large-model fine-tuning. We found that using 8 GPUs per node, specifically, two nodes with 8 GPUs each (16 GPUs in total) to fine-tune the 32B model, resulted in more efficient training due to tighter GPU coupling and better memory saturation. In contrast, HPC systems with only 4 GPUs per node required distributed training across more nodes, for example, 6 nodes (24 GPUs in total) on Isambard-AI, which introduced additional overhead and reduced efficiency.

            "title": "3.2 Pipeline overview",
            "content": "Our pipeline comprises multiple steps: indexing collection using vector database; retrieving documents via vector similarity to user query, reasoning about the obtained results and finally generating an answer. In this section, we cover each step of our pipeline, starting from the language model used, which is the central aspect of our system. 3.2.1 Lean language models Following previous research in test-time scaling [3, 7], we also employ Qwen2.5Instruct models due to their general competitive performance, extended context length and open-source availability. In particular, we focus here on models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, to understand model capabilities at different scales. In Figure 2, we replicate s1.18 fine-tuning by following the same training procedure as described in [7]9 at different model sizes and examine model performance on the (mathematical reasoning) AIME2410 benchmark. In this setting, the benefit of reasoning capabilities emerge clearly when adopting models with at least 14B parameters, while for smaller models (1.5B), the fine-tuning process ends up negatively impacting model performance. Although the authors also proposed budget forcing approach to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the models thinking process or lengthening it by appending Wait to the models generation when it tries to end, we did not apply it in this initial experiment in order to be able to compare baseline reasoning capabilities across sizes. 3.2.2 The retrieval system As described in Section 2.2, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system has two key components: retriever and generator. For our retriever, we used an embedding based approach where document chunks are indexed and given an vector embedding using sentence transformer model [51]. For querying the vector database, similarity search is performed to identify the top-k most similar chunks. As default embedding model, we adopt sentence-transformers/all-mpnetbase-v2. This model has 109 million parameters and maps sentences and paragraphs to 768-dimensional vector space. The maximum sequence length of this model is 384 tokens. Note when splitting our documents into chunks, we use chunk overlap of 50 tokens by default. In practice, we found that this sentence transformer model offered good performance while also being fast and cheap for inference. 8s1.1 (https://huggingface.co/simplescaling/s1.1-32B) is the successor of s1 with better reasoning performance by leveraging reasoning traces from DeepSeek-R1 instead of Gemini. The reasoning traces are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/simplescaling/s1K-1.1. 9To fine-tune Qwen2.5-Instruct on the s1K-1.1 dataset, we followed the training scripts available at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1. 10https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AIME_Problems_and_Solutions/ 10 Figure 2: Performance on AIME24 of Qwen2.5-Instruct models and their posttrained versions which are fine-tuned on DeepSeek-R1 reasoning traces (reproducing s1.1 work, following [7]). 11 We used Chroma 11 vector database which by default uses an ℓ2-norm similarity score metric. In our codebase, we also provide the functionality for the user to use alternative sentence transformer models and an option to use FAISS [52] database instead. In our use case, we found that Chroma and FAISS offered similar retrieval performance, but Chroma was slightly faster. Our retrieval system uses full document retrieval whereby if any chunk from particular document is found within this top-k set of chunks, our system proceeds to retrieve the entire original document from which that chunk originated. This ensures that the LLM receives the complete context surrounding the relevant information, even if only small portion of the document was initially flagged as relevant. 3.2.3 Synthetic data generation Given collection of documents, we use language model to generate series of queries that are: (a) relevant for selected document from the collection; and (b) rely on understanding information in the content of the document to provide valid answer. In this way we are able to generate large set of user requests and know in advance the correct answer (i.e., specific document and specific piece of information in the document). In order to build challenging evaluation dataset, we also prompted the model to produce more complex queries, for instance vague user requests. More details about this are given in the case-study described in the experimental section. In our experiments, we have relied on OpenAIs GPT-4o in order to generate set of high quality queries for testing the usefulness of our system, but our codebase allows users to customise their own set up, e.g., choice of model, prompt template and number of queries to generate. This way users could employ local LLM for this step of the process too. 3.2.4 Reasoning traces Given synthetically generated query and set of retrieved documents from our collection, we prompt large reasoning model to obtain its reasoning traces and final answer. For this step, we use DeepSeek-R1 in our experiments, but the user can easily choose different reasoning model. Through this process, we generate dataset of reasoning traces, each comprising query, set of retrieved documents, the reasoning process and the models final answer. 3.2.5 Fine-tuning We use the reasoning traces to fine-tune smaller model in order to to enhance its capabilities at test-time. The goal is that the model should start producing reasoning process, similar to the one of DeepSeek-R1, before providing its final answer, and that such reasoning process should improve overall performance. 11https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma 12 We follow the approach described in s1 [7] and perform supervised fine-tuning on next token prediction of Qwen2.5-Instruct models (ranging from 1.5 to 32B parameters), with basic hyperparameters. The main challenge, which distinguishes our work from the set up of s1, is the fact that each of our model responses are much longer compared to the ones in the s1 dataset, as they include reasoning traces and set of retrieved documents. This is due to the fact that we retrieve full documents rather than chunks as described in Section 3.2.2. In particular, in our first attempt to create reasoning traces with setting the number of retrieved documents to 5, the average token length of the training examples using the Qwen2.5 tokenizer was 74 641. By comparison, the s1K12 and s1K-1.113 datasets have an average token length of 9 109 and 26 969, respectively. In order to train our model maintaining the same computational resources, we have employed automatic document summarisation, to reduce the length of the input context, while still being able to benefit from the retrieved materials. 3.2.6 Retrieved document summarisation To make the training process possible, we reduced the length of the context by tackling in particular the size of the original documents in our collection, while maintaining their core information. We employed Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to generate summarised version of each document in our collection, reducing the size of each document by 85% of its original length. In our experiments, we also make sure that this has no impact on retrieval performance, but users should assess that this is consistent in other applications. By using summarised documents, the average token length of our reasoning traces was reduced to 7 544. An alternative approach to basic document summarisation would be query-aware document summarisation, namely to summarise each document on the fly, after having it retrieved. This way the summarisation process would know which part to keep (the ones relevant to the user query) and which to exclude from the summary. Note however that this would slow down the system, as it would be an additional LLM action for each user query, compared to having static, summarised version of the collection, as in our case."

For our RAG application, we wanted to allow the user to have back-and-forth conversation whereby the language model is given the previous conversation history and the retrieved context to construct response. To incorporate historical messages, it is necessary to use the conversation history and prompt template. Prompt templates turn raw user/human-AI chat interactions into format that the language model can work with and generate response for. Typically chat templates are language model-specific, meaning different language model families such as Llama [41], Gemma [19, 46] and Qwen [17, 53] use different chat templates. For example, for Qwen2.5-Instruct models use the following format to indicate the role and content of given interaction: <im_start>{role} {content}<im_end> The role can be one of user, assistant or system. system message can be useful to instruct the model to perform certain actions or undertake different characteristics such as the tone or style to use. Given list of user-AI chat interactions, we can use the Qwen prompt template to construct prompt to the language model such as: <im_start>system You are helpful assistant.<im_end> <im_start>user hello<im_end> <im_start>assistant Hello! How can assist you today?<im_end> For presenting retrieved context from knowledge base to the model, we can construct system prompt template (see Appendix A.1 for the system prompt we used for the exemplary application described in Section 4) which defines the task for the model and presents the retrieved context as well as additional information such as the demographics of the user. Note that we could alternatively have used user prompt template whereby the retrieved context is presented in the user message. We chose not to do this to limit the growth of the conversation history context length, since presenting retrieved context in the user message leads to the retrieved context staying in the conversation history as the chat develops. In our case, when retrieval is used, the retrieved context is provided to the model in the system prompt and so it can be different throughout the conversation. 14https://www.langchain.com/ 14 The language models used here all have finite context windows. Consequently, as conversations accumulate long message histories, it might be necessary to reduce the size of the chat history. We do this by trimming the history based on token count. Note that we never delete the system prompt from the history and only remove the oldest chat interactions if necessary. 3.3.2 Retrieval as tool In standard RAG setting, we may simply use the last user message as the query to the retriever. However, there are two key issues with this simple approach. Firstly, in many conversation interactions, the user message itself is not informative enough on its own to be useful query for the retriever. Common situations where this is the case are follow-up questions based on the previous conversation history. For instance, consider the following conversation: User : have been having headaches recently, what are common ways to alleviate headache? AI : Common ways to alleviate tension headache include taking overthe-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, applying warm or cool compress to your head or neck, and practising relaxation techniques. User : Where can buy them? In standard RAG setting, the query Where can buy them? is ambiguous without the context of the full conversation. Secondly, often user messages may be simple enough that the model would not require retrieval. For instance, for simple user messages such as Hello, it would be cheaper to avoid retrieval and for the model to respond directly. To address these two issues, it is possible to treat retrieval as tool that model has access to. For our purposes, tool is an association between function and its schema that defines the functions name, description and arguments. This schema is then passed to the language model and the language model can decide to use that tool by defining the name of the tool to use and the arguments to use. This approach leverage tool-calling 15 (sometimes called function-calling) which is now commonly supported in many modern chat models and endpoint providers. In such setting, we refer to the language model as an agent [20, 54] which combines language generation with actions. Generally, an agent refers to anything that can perceive its environment and act upon that environment [55]. The set of actions that an agent can perform is defined by the tools it has access to. For our RAG pipeline, the language model can be considered an agent and the tool is the text retriever. Therefore, for given user message, the model can decide to either 15For more details on tool-calling in LangChain, see https://python.langchain.com/docs/ concepts/tool_calling/. 15 query the retriever or to respond directly in natural language. Note that in our use-case, the language model ideally only decides to not to use retrieval in simple user messages since we want most model responses to be grounded with data from the knowledge base. In the case that the language model decides to use the retriever, tool-call is made and the language model decides the query to use. Since the language model has access to the conversation history, it can leverage previous chat interactions to choose relevant query to the vector database. Figure 3 presents the full flow of given query. First the query is presented to conversational agent language model which decides whether to query the retriever, or to respond directly (in the case of simple messages). The system prompt for this conversational agent is presented in Appendix A.2. If the conversational agent decides to perform tool call to the retriever, it writes query to the retriever given the chat history and retrieves relevant document chunks from the knowledge base. Lastly, we present the model the retrieved context through the system prompt of the reasoning model as described above to generate response given the chat history. Note that there is flexibility in the choice of language models at the different stages as the conversational agent language model which decides whether retrieve first and respond or respond directly can be different to the language model that uses the retrieved context to generate response. In our final model, we used Qwen2.5-Instruct-32B as the conversational agent language model and t0-1.1-k5-32B as the RAG language model, since we found Qwen2.5-Instruct-32B to be more consistent for tool-calling."

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages,17 and interacts with the Python chatbot (the backend ) via REST API. Users can create multiple separate conversation threads, 16https://svelte.dev/ 17https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/t0-1 16 Figure 4: Overview of our pipeline, covering the central aspects of the process: synthetic data creation, information retrieval, reasoning trace generation, and model fine-tuning. each with unique identifiers, and switch between them at will. The responses from the chatbot are parsed by the browser: by default, only the main answer is shown in full to the user, with reasoning traces available via dropdown toggle. In general, the backend has sole responsibility for storing the conversation history: the frontend only serves as way to parse and display this information to an end-user. Thus, the state of the frontend is fully derived from that of the backend; this design prevents potential inconsistencies that may arise if the frontend were to store its own copy of the conversation history. Because the Python chatbot is exposed over HTTP, and modern browsers do not (by default) allow HTTPS pages to make requests to HTTP endpoints, it was further necessary to set up an Nginx reverse proxy to act as an intermediary. Thus, insecure HTTP connections were handled by the proxy, and the website would only ever see connections to secure HTTPS URL. This could, if desired, be replaced with Caddy.18 For this proof of concept, it was considered unnecessary to introduce authentication such that each conversation could be uniquely associated with user. Thus, every visitor to the webpage can see every conversation available. Implementing authentication using OAuth2 would be an obvious next step for more serious deployment."

We consider the body of knowledge provided by the NHS A-to-Z condition website.19 For each of the almost 1 000 conditions listed, webpage provides information about it and series of possible next actions, depending on the patient symptoms (for instance asking for an urgent GP appointment or going directly to A&E). We consider this an interesting setting for testing our model, as it would require retrieval component (to interpret the user query and search across the available documents) and reasoning element (to interpret the patient symptoms and decide for the best next step, while staying grounded on the provided information). An overview of the process, which we will cover step by step in this section, is shown in Fig. 4. It is important to emphasize that the prototype presented here is not intended as tool for providing medical advice.

The prompt used for this task can be found in Appendix A.3. With this prompt, we reduced the size of each document by 85% of its original length, while maintaining core information relevant for the task, as every page contained boiler-plate text and repeated information.

We also ask the model to generate general patient information (e.g., age, occupation and social support), in line with the condition and disposition. We control the patient sex, as in early experiments we noticed the model was over-generating examples of female patients over male ones. In order to better understand how our approach would fail with more complex requests, we ask the model to generate three types of queries: basic: Based on single condition page, the query mentions relevant symptoms. hypochondriac: Based on single condition page, the query mentions relevant symptoms plus other unrelated complaints and expressions of excessive anxiety. downplay: Based on single condition page, the query downplays the severity of the symptoms. While basic represents the most common type of requests for this type of system, hypochondriac and downplay challenge the pipeline by offering either too much or too little information about the condition and severity level. The prompt used for generating the synthetic data is available in Appendix A.4. As an example, the following synthetic request was generated with an input prompt for basic query from woman which should be matched with the condition hip-replacement and the disposition should be urgent primary care. The rest of the content in the example is generated by GPT-4o: 19 Example General patient information: age: 65, sex: female, occupation: retired live with my husband who helps me around Teacher, social support: have osteoarthritis and occasionally take the house., medical history: over-the-counter pain relief. No other significant conditions. Symptoms Description: had hip replacement about two weeks ago, and initially everything seemed fine, but now Im noticing some worrisome symptoms. The area around my hip is swollen and red, and its feeling more tender than it did before. Im also bit shivery, and when checked, had temperature of about 38.5C this morning. feel slightly more pain in my leg when try to walk. dont see any pus from the wound, but Im worried it might be the start of an infection. Should get it checked urgently? Using the process described above, we generated two datasets, one containing 1 000 synthetic queries as an evaluation set and second one containing 2 000 synthetic queries as dataset to be used for fine-tuning. To ensure no overlap between our evaluation and fine-tuning datasets, we identified queries which had the same combination of condition and disposition. We then removed these queries from the fine-tuning dataset and generated further data to bring our total number of queries back up to 2 000. clinician reviewed subset of our synthetically generated requests, confirming their suitability and different levels of complexity. We relied on frontier LLM (GPT-4o) for this step; this part of our approach would require different strategy if adopted on private data held in secure environments. As alternatives, we suggest the following options: if possible, obtaining examples of real queries on the body of knowledge under study, which would then perfectly reflect the type of process to automatize. Alternatively, we recommend adopting small-scale model that can be run on-premise like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and then following the rest of our approach for synthetic data generation. In this case, careful evaluation of the synthetic data quality is essential to ensure its effectiveness for downstream tasks."

As described in the overview of the system setup, when indexing full documents, these are divided into chunks to allow the identification of specific passages in the condition page that are relevant to the query. Chunking increases the number of documents in the database from 988 to 5 824. We consider series of cutoffs when testing the retrieval system, ranging from = 1, where only the most similar document in the vector database is returned, to = 100. 20 The metric p@k refers to the fraction, p, of queries for which the correct condition is present among the returned documents. For example, p@5 is the proportion of queries for which the correct condition appears among the five most similar documents retrieved. Note that when retrieving summaries, the cutoff number corresponds to the number of condition pages since the summarised documents all had context length smaller than that of our embedding model (384), while for full documents it corresponds to the number of chunks returned. Knowing the performance at different cutoffs allows us to choose suitable number of retrieved documents to use when combining retrieval and reasoning. higher number of documents will guarantee, in most cases, that the correct condition is retrieved, but will also lead to longer context for the downstream LLM, impacting fine-tuning and reasoning.

Note that for our chosen use-case, we know what type of queries the system will receive, so we have summarised content in way that retains that information. For more general retrieval system not only focused on determining condition and disposition, it may be more advisable to index full pages. Regarding the cutoffs, we initially experimented with = 5 and = 30, which retrieved the correct condition in respectively 76 % and 93 % of queries. Regarding the fine-tuning process and final experiments detailed below, we use = 5 retrieved documents, as this results in manageable context length given our resource constraints, and is easier to explore via the user interface. Note, however, that this choice imposes maximum achievable prediction accuracy of 76%, since the reasoner only considers the retrieved documents as potentially relevant. To address this limitation while maintaining short list of retrieved documents, we explored several strategies, including reranking the results via an additional LLM call (similar to [57]) and rephrasing user queries, inspired by the reasoning-and-acting approach of the ReAct framework [20]. However, these alternatives did not consistently lead to significant improvements in our setting."

In Table 2, we report the performance of our 32B parameter fine-tuned model (named t0-1.1-k5-32B) on two tasks: (i) determining the condition of synthetic patient, given the textual description of the symptoms; and (ii) establishing the next course of actions among the options suggested in the document content. We assume that baseline non-reasoning model (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) would already have some general knowledge to be able to perform such task at decent level. However, the integration of retrieval and reasoning capabilities should improve performance, as in domain evidence would be additionally offered to the model. The prompt templates used to evaluate model performance on predicting the condition and the suitable next action are given in Appendix A.6. To provide comparison with other systems, we report performance of two recent comparable lean reasoning models, s1.1-32B [7] and Qwen3-32B [53] and also series of state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1), to understand overall frontier performance. For t0-1.1-k5-32B and s1.1-32B we use budget-forcing to control test-time compute as described in [7].21 As presented in Table 2, 32B parameter model already has some core knowledge in the topic at hand, as it is able to identify the correct condition from the synthetic patient description in 38 % of the cases and predicts the correct next course of action 46 % of the time. This starting point assessment is necessary to establish the initial capacity of the adopted language model. Depending on the considered task and domain of knowledge, performance will vary, especially when applications are focused on specific body of knowledge that is not widely available, such as materials only shared on the intranet of an organisation. For comparison, frontier non-reasoning model, such as GPT-4o, starts with an accuracy of 49 % for conditions and 56 % for disposition. Providing retrieved documents helps models in better predicting for the two tasks, with performance increase of over 15 % for condition accuracy for the relatively small Qwen2.5-32B and 7 % for GPT-4o. Qwen also gains 4 percentage points improvement for disposition accuracy, while instead GPT-4o sees its performance slightly decreasing, potentially due to more ambiguity from the amount of information now available. Large performance improvements for condition accuracy are also observed for the two frontier reasoning models examined (o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1), highlighting the substantial benefit of incorporating retrieval component to provide relevant in-domain evidence to the model. Moving to the lean models examined, we can see the additional benefit of integrating thinking process before providing the final answer. Our t0-1.1-k5-32B, which has been fine-tuned on in-domain reasoning examples, further increases the accuracy in determining the correct condition, with an almost 20% performance 21In particular, we enforce maximum token count of 1024 and suppress the generation of the end-of-thinking token delimiter maximum of 3 times. 23 Table 2: Condition and disposition accuracy by LLM and value. We report first the examined lean language models and then series of frontier large language models. dash () indicates value of zero: that is, the model was provided with no retrieved context, as baseline. Note that for all models relying on retrieval component, their maximum accuracy achievable for condition is 0.76, as already discussed regarding Table 1. All reported values are average accuracies over 10 runs. Standard deviations were consistently around 0.01 and are omitted for clarity.

The results for condition accuracy outperform those of other leaner reasoning solutions examined (s1.1-32B and the newly released Qwen3-32B), bringing the model into the same realm as massively larger frontier reasoning models such as o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. We do not see similar drastic improvement for determining the disposition. While the model performs better than the base Qwen2.5-Instruct-32B and of general purpose lean reasoning models, it does not reach the performance of frontier model as o3-mini. We believe this is due to the reasoning traces provided by DeekSeek-R1, which set the limit of expertise that can be distilled into smaller models, compared to the better reasoning process of o3-mini for dispositions. It 24 is also important to note that o3-mini shows very low performance for condition accuracy when prompted without retrieved documents. From inspecting the outputs, it seems that o3-mini loses focus when making prediction without supporting evidence, and ends up considering too many possible scenarios. The main outcome of this evaluation is that retrieval augmented lean reasoner model can shortlist the correct condition among few options in 76% of cases (as shown in Table 1), and predict the correct condition in 56% of cases, comparable to state-of-the-art frontier models (as shown in Table 2). This serves as strong starting point before initiating conversation with the user, which would allow the model to gather additional information, expand its search in the database, and more accurately narrow down the possible conditions and patient disposition (see an example of the conversational interface in Figure 6)."

For determining the right condition, performance increases to 62% for hypochondriac queries, as many more additional details are added, however both in this case and for what concerns downplay queries performance for disposition drops to around 45%, exactly because they have been generated to challenge the model. Compared to our model, which has been fine-tuned for in-domain reasoning, general-purpose reasoning model such as s1.1 performs 3 to 12% worse, depending on the query type and evaluation metric.

To address this problem, several strategies could be considered, such as: manually creating reasoning traces based on set of given queries and retrieved documents; hosting and querying general-purpose reasoning model on local or private infrastructure, with manual correction of its responses to generate the needed traces; taking general-purpose reasoner and further fine-tuning it on local or private infrastructure (which may require even fewer traces).

While our model outperforms all other lean approaches for the task, as discussed in Tables 2 and 3, it still requires around 64GBs of GPU memory to load the model in 16-bit precision. As such request is not always readily available for teams which are employing secure environments with resource constraints, in this section we explore whether we can further reduce the 26 model size without significantly impacting the overall performance. The possibility of enhancing reasoning abilities in small language models via distillation is one of the main contributions of [6]. However as shown in Figure 2, depending on the task, the model will start outperforming its non-reasoning baseline only from certain size. In similar fashion, we evaluate the performance of distilled models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with the smallest models requiring only 3 to 6 GB of GPU memory, making them suitable for execution on most modern laptops22. Table 4: Condition and disposition accuracy with different model sizes, with 5 documents retrieved. We also report as reference the performance of the 32B non reasoning baseline (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) and of the frontier model from which reasoning was distilled from (DeepSeek-R1), with the same number of documents retrieved.

As shown in Table 4,23 distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller models is feasible: even 1.5B parameter model maintains performance comparable to 32B parameter non-reasoning model, especially in condition prediction, and learns effectively from its 671B parameter frontier teacher. To better understand the performance boost that the combination of RAG and reasoning offers at different model sizes, we have presented in Figure 5 comparison for condition prediction between each initial Qwen2.5-Instruct model, the same model with RAG and finally the post-trained t0 version, which combines RAG and reasoning. The figure highlights an important insight for many downstream applications: while for 32B parameter model, the primary performance gain comes from the models core ability to interpret the retrieved information, for leaner models (1.5B and 3B), large performance boost is given by in-domain reasoning training which offers this interpretation ability that was otherwise lacking.24 Such small-scale retrieval 22All our distilled models are available at https://huggingface.co/alan-turing-institute. 23We compute rough estimate of the memory required to store the model parameters using 16-bit precision using the formula: GPU memory needed (bytes) = 2 Number of parameters, as 2 bytes are needed per parameter. 24At size 1.5B for instance, Qwen2.5+RAG and t0 are provided with the same documents retrieved for each query and the only difference is that the reasoning model t0 is now provided with the ability to process the content in more details and therefore predicting the condition much better. 27 augmented reasoning models can in-fact deliver performance comparable to models over ten times larger, which significantly broadens the range of deployment scenarios. Such models are lightweight enough to run on many consumer-grade laptops, making them viable for widespread use in research and government applications. Figure 5: Performance on condition prediction of Qwen2.5-Instruct models alone, with the use of RAG and with their post-trained t0 versions which combine RAG and reasoning. As extensively discussed in our report, if other teams want to pursue this, it is essential to set clear benchmark for the desired task, to understand (i) whether combination of retrieval and reasoning could improve performance and reduce hallucinations and other types of errors, compared to base model, and (ii) what is the best trade-off between model size and performance, as depending on the application, leaner solution could still deliver reliable performance while very significantly reducing the computational requirements and costs."

To show its usefulness for decision making on domain-specific collections, we have presented case study about determining conditions and disposition of series of synthetic requests using the NHS A-to-Z collection as body of knowledge. Our model performed at comparable level with frontier reasoning model and especially outperformed other small-scale reasoning models that have been trained on mathematical reasoning and not fine-tuned for domain-specific applications. Finally, we highlight that it is possible to further reduce model size via distillation of reasoning capabilities in very 25During experimentations, we have also considered the fourth option request ambulance, which would have been predicted in this case to avoid risking further fall by mobilising. 29 small models, while keeping strong performance. We hope our overview and the paired GitHub codebase will be useful to others interested in combining reasoning and retrieval capabilities in domain-specific settings."

You are helpful clinical AI assistant deployed in the United Kingdom You will be given description of some of the users symptoms and some retieved context from NHS condition web pages which provide information about various medical conditions that could be relevant to those symptoms. Use the description of the users symptoms, the following retrieved context and similarity scores for each piece of context (a lower similarity score means the higher similarity to the patient's query) to work out what condition(s) the user is suffering from and provide recommendation of what they should do next. Never state or refer to the similarity scores to the user. Ask follow up questions to the user to gather more information or for further details about their symptoms to narrow down the potential conditions. Focus on the most serious conditions first. In your response, reply in English and always refer to the user in the second person. If you don't know the answer to question, just say that you don't know.

Retrieved context: {context} This is summary of their demographics: {demographics} A.2 Conversational agent system prompt For our conversational RAG pipeline described in Section 3.3.1, below is the system prompt to the conversational agent language model which decides whether to use the retrieval tool or to reply directly. You are helpful clinical AI assistant deployed in the United Kingdom You are provided tool that can retrieve context from knowledge base taken from NHS condition web pages which provide information about various medical conditions. You should always use the tool to find relevant information to answer the patient's question rather than relying on your own knowledge. If you are confused or unsure about the user's question, you should use the tool to find relevant information or ask the user for more information or ask further details about their symptoms. For follow up questions from the user, you should always use the tool to find new relevant information to answer the user's question given the conversation history. You should only not use the tool in very simple messages that do not require any context like \"Hello\" or \"Thank you\", or when the user is just writing something random. You can also ask the user for more information or ask further details about their symptoms. If you are going to reply to the user, always conclude with question to keep the conversation going to help the user or ask for more details about their symptoms. In your response, only reply in English and always refer to the user in the second person. Decide to use the tool at the start. Do not use the tool after you have already started your response. 37 A.3 Prompt template for summarisation For obtaining summarised versions of our documents as described in Section 4.1, we used the following user prompt: Summarise the document below, focusing only on symptoms and how to decide the next course of action. Be concise - aim for summary of 3-4 sentences or fewer, keeping only essential information. Document: {document} A.4 Prompt template for synthetic user query generation For generating synthetic user queries as discussed in Section 4.2, the following user prompt was used: Generate synthetic NHS 111 query based on the following details: ### Query Type: * \"basic\": Based on single condition page, the query mentions relevant symptoms * \"hypochondriac\": Based on single condition page, the query mentions relevant symptoms plus other unrelated complaints and expressions of excessive anxiety * \"downplay\": Based on single condition page, the query downplays the severity of the symptoms ### Condition Content Source: * The primary textual content extracted from the relevant NHS condition web pages ### Severity Level: * A&E: Emergency hospital treatment required * Urgent Primary Care: patient should be seen as soon as possible, by GP, urgent care centre, or similar * Self-care: Issue can be handled at home and/or with over-the-counter medication ### Required JSON Output: Return the query in the following structured JSON format: ```json { \"general_demographics\": { \"age\": \"[Realistic adult age given symptoms and severity, e.g., 20-80, for anyone above 80 use 'above 80']\", 38 \"sex\": \"{sex}\", \"occupation\": \"[A common occupation]\", \"social_support\": \"[Specify if the patient has social support network, such as partner, family member, or living carer.

Do not provide any explanation to the output, only your final answer. 40 Remember that the condition must either be one of {sources} or \" inconclusive\" if you think that the condition is not listed. Remember that the severity level must be one of [\"Self-care\", \"Urgent Primary Care\", \"A&E\"]. In this template, we present to the model the retrieved context from our retriever along with their similarity scores (L2-norm), the user query and their demographics (which are synthetically generated as per Section 4.2) and finally the titles of the documents retrieved (i.e., the retrieved conditions). A.6 Prompt templates for condition and next action prediction In this section, we share the prompts used to evaluate various models on the task of determining the condition of synthetic patient and the next course of action as outlined in Section 4.5. For several models considered (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o, o3-mini, Qwen3-32B), to obtain condition and next action prediction, we presented the model with tool to submit their answer which was simply function with two arguments: condition and severity. This ensured simple and consistent parsing of the model predictions. The system and user prompts for these models are presented in Appendix A.6.1. For details on tool binding, the process whereby models are made aware of available tools, see LangChains documentation on tool calling at https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/. However, for other models (DeepSeek-R127, s1.1-32B, t0-1.1-k5-32B), tool-use was not available. For these models, we used different prompt to ask the model to submit the condition and the severity level prediction directly in the format: \"(condition, severity)\". We wrote parsers to obtain the condition and severity levels. The system and user prompts for these models are presented in Appendix A.6.2. Lastly, we also evaluate model performance without the retrieval system. In this case, we just present the model the list of 989 conditions. The prompts used for models with and without tool-use options are presented in Appendix A.6.3 and A.6.4, respectively. For brevity, we do not add the full list of 989 conditions here. A.6.1 Prompt templates for models with tool-use options System prompt You are clinical AI assistant. You will be given description of patient's symptoms, some retrieved context that could be relevant to those symptoms and similarity scores 27At time of evaluation, tool-use and function-calling was not supported for DeepSeek-R1 on Azure AI Foundry. 41 for each piece of context (a lower similarity score means the higher similarity to the patient's query).

You should use the provided tool to submit the condition and severity level. Importantly, if you think that the condition is not listed, please use \" inconclusive\" for the condition. User prompt template Use the following pieces of retrieved context and similarity scores (lower scores means higher similarity to the patient's query): {context} patient has given the following description of their symptoms: \"{question}\" This is summary of their demographics: {demographics} Using the sources and context provided, use the \" submit_condition_recommendation\" tool to submit the condition and the severity level. Remember that the condition must either be one of {sources} or \" inconclusive\" if you think that the condition is not listed.
