            "content": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) (Zhao et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Hurst et al., 2024) have expanded their impact beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal domains (Yin et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024). Among these, large audio-language models (LALMs) (Lakhotia et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; DÃ©fossez et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2025) have attracted significant attention in the auditory-processing community. LALMs are multimodal LLMs that process auditory and/or textual input, such as speech, audio, and music, and generate textual and/or auditory output. They can be trained from scratch or fine-tuned from text LLM backbones with auditory modaliFigure 1: LALMs diverse capabilities and modalities covered. Icons from https://www.flaticon.com. ties inserted. By integrating auditory modalities with language understanding, they show potential in auditory processing (Huang et al., 2024a), multimodal reasoning (Sakshi et al., 2025), and humancomputer interaction (Lin et al., 2024a). As LALMs evolve, expectations for their capabilities have expanded from basic tasks like speech recognition to more complex ones such as audiogrounded reasoning (Sakshi et al., 2025) and interactive dialogue (Lin et al., 2025a). Figure 1 illustrates this multifaceted nature, emphasizing the diverse input and output modalities involved and the wide range of abilities these models are expected to demonstrate. To evaluate these capabilities, variety of benchmarks have been developed (Lin et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2024c; Cheng et al., 2025). However, the evaluation landscape remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. Existing surveys (Wu et al., 2024a; Peng et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2024; Arora et al., 2025a) focus primarily on model architectures and training methodologies, with less emphasis on the equally important role of evaluation in assessing LALMs capabilities. This gap makes it challenging for researchers to find suitable benchmarks for their models or to pinpoint the fields progress. Therefore, structured overview of LALM evaluation frameworks is needed. This paper presents comprehensive survey of LALM evaluation frameworks and introduces taxonomy categorizing evaluation dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth survey and taxonomy specifically focused on LALM evaluation. We organize the frameworks into four primary categories: General Auditory Awareness and Processing (3), Knowledge and Reasoning (4), Dialogue-oriented Ability (5), and Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness (6). We also highlight challenges in LALM evaluation (7), such as data contamination and insufficient consideration of human diversity, while suggesting promising future directions. Overall, our contributions are threefold: (1) presenting the first comprehensive survey of LALM evaluations, (2) proposing structured taxonomy for LALM evaluation that offers clear guidelines for researchers, and (3) identifying key challenges and future directions to improve evaluation coverage and robustness."

Despite numerous benchmarks for LALMs emerging, the evaluation landscape remains fragmented. To address this, we present the first structured taxonomy of LALM evaluations. Figure 2 shows our taxonomy, with some works included1. The full categorization of the surveyed works is in Appendix A. We organize the surveyed works into four categories by evaluation objectives: General Auditory Awareness and Processing evaluates the auditory awareness and fundamental processing tasks, e.g., speech recognition and audio captioning. Knowledge and Reasoning assesses LALMs knowledge acquisition and advanced reasoning skills, examining their intelligence. Dialogue-oriented Ability focuses on natural conversational skills, including affective and 1Some span many categories due to their complexity. contextual interaction, dialogue management, and instruction following.

This section reviews works evaluating both acoustic awareness and foundational auditory processing, emphasizing these core capabilities that set LALMs apart from LLMs."

            "content": "Benchmarks for auditory awareness examine how effectively LALMs realize acoustic cues like emotion, prosody, and environmental sounds. SALMon (Maimon et al., 2025) specifically evaluates sensitivity to acoustic inconsistencies (e.g., sudden speaker or emotional changes) and misalignments between acoustic signals and semantic content (e.g., conveying sad content with cheerful tone). These evaluations reveal significant gaps between LALMs and human-level perception. EmphAssess (Seyssel et al., 2024) measures LALMs awareness of prosodic emphasis by requiring speech-to-speech paraphrasing or translation that accurately preserves and transfers emphasis on specific parts of the input utterance. This evaluates LALMs ability to capture and maintain fine-grained prosodic features. These benchmarks highlight challenges in finegrained auditory awareness among current models, underscoring the need for improved modeling of subtle acoustic and paralinguistic information (Maimon et al., 2025; Seyssel et al., 2024)."

Initially driven by representation learning models (Baevski et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022), enriched datasets (Pratap et al., 2020; Piczak, 2015a; Hawthorne et al., 2019), and existing benchmarks (Yang et al., 2021; Turian et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023), recent works adapt these resources into instruction-oriented evaluation frameworks tailored for LALMs. Dynamic-SUPERB (Huang et al., 2024a) initiated this direction, constructing 55 multiple-choice question-answering (QA) tasks spanning speech, audio, and music modalities. Subsequent efforts, such as AIR-Bench (Yang et al., 2024c) and AudioBench (Wang et al., 2025a), extend to openended QA formats. MuChoMusic (Weck et al., 2024) specifically emphasizes music-related tasks, while Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 (Huang et al., 2025a) significantly enlarges the benchmark to 180 tasks, forming the largest evaluation suite for LALMs general processing abilities to date. Given the task diversity, various evaluation metrics are adopted depending on the task specificity, such as word error rate for speech recognition and BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) for translation. There is also an emerging trend that includes LLMas-a-judge (Gu et al., 2024) for scalable, automatic evaluation of open-ended responses (Huang et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2024c; Wang et al., 2025a). Despite achieving promising results in certain areas, these benchmarks demonstrate that current LALMs still fall short of universally robust performance across auditory-processing tasks (Huang et al., 2025a), highlighting substantial room for improvement toward truly auditory foundation models."

Evaluating LALMs linguistic proficiency typically use likelihood-based benchmarks where models choose the more linguistically plausible option from paired speech samples. These tests cover lexical knowledge, syntax, and semantic coherence. Representative works include the ZeroSpeech 2021 benchmark (Nguyen et al., 2020), which consists of multiple tracks for evaluating linguistic capabilities. The lexical-level assessment track, sWUGGY, tests models ability to distinguish between real words and phonotactically similar nonwords, while the syntactic sensitivity evaluation track, sBLIMP, focuses on differentiating grammatical from ungrammatical sentences. CSZS (Huang et al., 2024b) extends syntactic evaluation to multilingual and code-switched scenarios. Narrative and semantic coherence are evaluated by tasks like sStoryCloze and tStoryCloze (Hassid et al., 2023), where models are tasked with selecting semantically appropriate continuations to spoken stories."

            "title": "4.2 World Knowledge Assessment",
            "content": "Real-world tasks often demand integrating external knowledge beyond basic auditory understanding. World knowledge assessment evaluates LALMs on two main aspects: (1) auditory expertise like music structure and medical sound diagnosis, and (2) general commonsense and factual knowledge. Benchmarks that evaluate auditory expertise include MuChoMusic (Weck et al., 2024) and MMAU (Sakshi et al., 2025), which focus on musical understanding, such as melodic structure, harmony, instrument identification, and contextual music interpretation. Additionally, SAGI (Bu et al., 2024) assesses medical expertise, such as recognizing illnesses from audio cues like coughing. Commonsense and factual knowledge evaluations often convert established text benchmarks into spoken form using text-to-speech (TTS). VoxEval (Cui et al., 2025) and VoiceBench serve as spoken counterparts to MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), testing models across diverse factual domains like social science and humanities. Audiopedia (Penamakuri et al., 2025) uses knowledge graphs from Wikidata (VrandeËcic and KrÃ¶tzsch, 2014) to create audio-based, knowledge-intensive QA tasks that evaluate models knowledge of well-known entities, such as brands, mentioned in audio. These benchmarks thoroughly assess LALMs knowledge acquisition, revealing challenges such as limited auditory expertise (Weck et al., 2024) and inconsistent performance across domains. Different LALMs excel in different domains, each with their own strengths, but their performance often noticeably declines outside their own specialized areas (Cui et al., 2025). Overall, there remains substantial room to improve LALMs auditory expertise and factual knowledge."

            "content": "Content-based reasoning assesses LALMs ability to reason over the semantic content of auditory queries. Current benchmarks for this capability typically transform NLP reasoning benchmarks into spoken questions via TTS and require LALMs to provide answers. For instance, VoxEval (Cui et al., 2025), URO-Bench (Yan et al., 2025), and ADU-Bench (Gao et al., 2024) convert NLP datasets like GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) into speech, evaluating LALMs mathematical reasoning based on spoken questions. During synthesis, various speaking styles (e.g., mispronunciation, disfluencies, and accents) may be introduced to test models robustness (Cui et al., 2025). These benchmarks reveal gaps in current LALMs content-based reasoning abilities, even with chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022). Moreover, model performance varies significantly across speaking styles (Cui et al., 2025), indicating instability in their reasoning."

            "title": "4.3.2 Acoustic-based Reasoning",
            "content": "Acoustic-based reasoning requires LALMs to infer from acoustic cues in auditory input, often involving reasoning across multiple auditory modalities or combining auditory understanding with cognitive skills such as compositional, temporal, logical, and multi-hop reasoning. Cross-auditory Modality Reasoning demands joint reasoning over multiple auditory modalities, like speech and non-speech sounds. Wang et al. (2025d) propose an open-ended QA benchmark assessing co-reasoning on speech and environmental sounds, requiring reasoning over cues from distinct auditory sources to infer speakers activities. Their findings show that current LALMs frequently neglect non-speech cues, leading to failures. Compositional and Temporal Reasoning involves comprehending structured acoustic events, their temporal relationships, and attribute binding. Benchmarks like CompA (Ghosh et al., 2024b) evaluate these abilities through specific tasks: CompA-order challenges models to identify correct event sequences or align audio temporal structures with textual descriptions, while CompAattribute focuses on associating sound events with their sources and attributes. MMAU (Sakshi et al., 2025) assesses temporal reasoning via event counting and duration comparison. Logical reasoning covers structured inference, including deductive and causal reasoning. Deductive reasoning can be tested by Audio Entailment (Deshmukh et al., 2025a), which evaluates whether textual hypothesis logically follows from auditory input based on acoustic attributes like sound sources. MMAU (Sakshi et al., 2025) examines LALMs causal reasoning on cause-and-effect relationships of events. Multi-hop reasoning is the ability to recall and integrate multiple information to answer complex queries, enabling models to connect stored knowledge without explicit reasoning steps (Yang et al., 2024d,e; Biran et al., 2024). SAKURA (Yang et al., 2025a) evaluates LALMs multi-hop reasoning by requiring integration of auditory attributes (e.g., speaker gender and emotion) with stored knowledge. Results show that LALMs struggle to combine auditory information with stored knowledge for reasoning, even when both types of information are extracted and known by the models."

These benchmarks emphasize LALMs ability to respond using both content and non-content cues such as emotional tone, speaking style, and speaker traits. StyleTalk (Lin et al., 2024a) presents models with dialogue history and the users current speech segment, intentionally leaving the users intent underspecified when relying solely on the content. Consequently, models are required to leverage paralinguistic cues to respond appropriately. Subsequent works, such as SD-Eval (Ao et al., 2024) and VoxDialogue (Cheng et al., 2025), broaden the evaluation by incorporating more acoustic and contextual variables, including speaker age, accent, and environmental conditions. These benchmarks combine objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)), LLM-based judgment (Gu et al., 2024), and human evaluation for comprehensive assessment. While these benchmarks rely on static data, Li et al. (2025) proposes an interactive framework inspired by Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024), where real users converse with models on topics of their choice and provide pairwise model preferences, enabling dynamic, user-centered evaluation."

These behaviors are detailed in Appendix C. as Talking Turns (Arora et al., 2025b) and Full-DuplexBench (Lin et al., 2025a), commonly evaluate four key dimensions: Representative works, such Timing for speaking up or interrupting: Assesses LALMs ability to distinguish meaningful pauses from turn-yielding moments, avoiding undesired interruptions and taking over turns appropriately. Backchanneling: Evaluates whether LALMs backchannel at proper moments with suitable frequency, reflecting their active listening. Turn taking: Examines whether LALMs transition smoothly between turns by recognizing boundaries, managing latency, and signaling their intent to maintain or yield the floor. User interruption handling: Assesses LALMs handling of interruption, e.g., pausing and smoothly resuming the conversation. Both use automatic evaluation metrics. Talking Turns uses supervised models trained on human dialogues (Godfrey et al., 1992) as reference, while Full-Duplex-Bench uses metrics like response latency. However, these methods often rely on heuristics, which may be inaccurate in some cases. Their results show that LALMs struggle with full-duplex management, especially with interruptions (Arora et al., 2025b) and seamless turn transitions (Lin et al., 2025a), highlighting current limitations in dynamic spoken interaction. 5."

            "content": "Instruction following is the ability to follow userspecified instructions, e.g., requirements for performing particular actions, adhering to constraints, and adjusting response styles. Effective instruction following is essential for model controllability. LALM instruction-following evaluations typically involve three approaches: (1) adding constraints to existing LALM benchmarks not originally for instruction following, (2) synthesizing LLM instruction-following benchmarks into speech, or (3) creating new dedicated datasets. For instance, Speech-IFeval (Lu et al., 2025) introduces constraints into LALM benchmarks such as Dynamic-SUPERB Phase-2 (Huang et al., 2025a); VoiceBench (Chen et al., 2024c) synthesizes IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023a), text-based LLM instruction-following benchmark, into speech; and URO-Bench (Yan et al., 2025) creates custom evaluation datasets. Evaluating instruction adherence helps distinguish limitations in following instructions and deficiencies in auditory understanding or knowledge. Common evaluated constraints include length (e.g., minimum number of words), format (e.g., responses in JSON or all caps), action (e.g., chainof-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022)), style (e.g., responses in humorous tone), and content (e.g., including specific word). During evaluation, instruction-following rates, i.e., the frequency with which instructions are correctly followed, are measured with rule-based (Zhou et al., 2023a) or LLMas-a-judge methods (Gu et al., 2024). Benchmark results reveal significant gaps in LALMs compared to their LLM backbones in instruction following (Lu et al., 2025), indicating catastrophic forgetting when adapting LLMs to auditory modalities."

            "content": "Fairness and bias are key ethical concerns for LALMs, ensuring they do not reinforce societal inequalities, discrimination, stereotypes, or biases. Such issues can be triggered by either the speech content or its non-content acoustic cues. For example, content-triggered bias may arise when LALMs translate occupation-related terms in the speech content into stereotypical gendered terms, independent of acoustic characteristics. In contrast, acoustic-triggered bias may arise when vocal cues lead the model to associate speakers gender with certain occupations. Lin et al. (2024c) quantifies LALMs contenttriggered gender biases via four tasks: speech-totext translation, coreference resolution, sentence continuation, and question answering. In each task, gender biases and stereotypes are measured based on the models responses. Conversely, Spoken Stereoset (Lin et al., 2024b) assesses acoustic-triggered bias on speakers gender and age. The authors sampled sentences from NLP datasets like Stereoset (Nadeem et al., 2021) and BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022), which were then rewritten in the first-person perspective with explicit gender or age indicators (e.g., mother) removed to ensure bias would be triggered by speaker characteristics rather than content. The modified sentences were synthesized into speech using TTS with voices of different genders and ages. These spoken sentences served as the context, and LALMs were tasked with selecting continuations from options that were stereotypical, antistereotypical, or unrelated to the context. These works highlight LALMs social biases, which may be inherited from their training data or LLM backbones. Additionally, since social biases are multifaceted, current benchmarks cannot include all possible societal factors, emphasizing the need for further research into both model development and benchmarks to enhance fairness."

Current studies typically use NLP datasets with malicious queries and convert them into speech via TTS. For example, VoiceBench (Chen et al., 2024c) and Roh et al. (2025) synthesize datasets like AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) into spoken queries, evaluating LALMs on their ability to reject them. During evaluation, jailbreaking techniques may be employed to test models resistance to adversarial inputs. These include modifying speech content by inserting fictional scenarios (Shen et al., 2024) and applying auditory manipulations such as silence (Yang et al., 2025b), noise (Yang et al., 2025b; Xiao et al., 2025), accents (Roh et al., 2025; Xiao et al., 2025), and audio edits (Xiao et al., 2025; Gupta et al., 2025). Ideally, LALMs should remain robust to adversarially modified inputs and consistently reject malicious requests. However, evaluations show that LALMs often accept malicious spoken inputs even when they can refuse similar textual ones (Chen et al., 2024c). Moreover, LALMs show considerable safety degradation compared to their LLM backbones (Yang et al., 2025b). Several jailbreaking methods can easily bypass these models (Roh et al., 2025; Xiao et al., 2025), highlighting the need for better multimodal safety alignment."

In LALMs, hallucinations can originate from both auditory and textual modalities. While textual hallucinations can be assessed with NLP benchmarks (Li et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a; Bang et al., 2025), we focus on auditoryinduced hallucinations. Kuan et al. (2024a) explores LALMs object hallucination, where the models falsely identify objects or events absent from the auditory input. They evaluate this via two tasks: discriminative task where LALMs determine whether specified object exists in the audio, and generative task where LALMs generate captions describing the audio. These captions are then evaluated for accuracy in reflecting the actual content of the audio. Despite generating accurate captions, LALMs struggle with object identification in the discriminative task, revealing challenges in object hallucination for question-answering tasks. Leng et al. (2024) further analyzes object hallucination using the CMM benchmark, showing that overrepresented objects or events in the training data can lead LALMs to incorrectly predict their presence, even when they are absent. Additionally, the frequent co-occurrence of objects and events during training exacerbates these hallucinations. These works highlight hallucination challenges in LALMs and call for improved training, modeling, and data handling to enhance trustworthiness."

            "title": "7.1 Data Leakage and Contamination",
            "content": "Creating and curating high-quality auditory data is far more difficult than for text. Consequently, many LALM benchmarks rely on existing auditory corpora (Panayotov et al., 2015a; Kim et al., 2019; Gemmeke et al., 2017) rather than collecting new data. This raises concerns about data leakage, since models may have seen these datasets during training (Deng et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023b; Jacovi et al., 2023), undermining evaluation reliability. The risk grows when large-scale web-crawled data (Radford et al., 2023; He et al., 2024) are used for training without rigorous filtering. Thus, alongside creating or collecting custom data, developing methods to detect and mitigate contamination (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2024; Samuel et al., 2025) will be crucial direction for more reliable LALM evaluations. 7.2 Inclusive Evaluation Across Linguistic, Cultural, and Communication Diversity While current benchmarks cover major languages like English and Mandarin (Huang et al., 2025a; Yan et al., 2025), many overlook crucial aspects such as low-resource languages (Magueresse et al., 2020) and code-switching (DogruÃ¶z et al., 2021; Sitaram et al., 2019). Although these have been explored in traditional speech technologies (Khare et al., 2021; Bhogale et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b), they remain underexamined in LALMs. This limited coverage fails to capture the full linguistic diversity of human communication, as different languages possess unique characteristics (Evans and Levinson, 2009; Bickel, 2014). Cultural factors, shaped by historical and social contexts, influence dimensions like moral norms (Graham et al., 2016; Saucier, 2018) and are essential for evaluation. As LALMs extend to diverse cultures (Yang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2025b), evaluation frameworks must also expand. Along with language and culture, communication patterns also matter. While some work covers speech variations like accents, underrepresented groups such as people with speech disorders (e.g., dysarthria (Kent et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2008)) are often overlooked, as current LALMs have limited familiarity with their unique speech patterns, which affects fair and accurate understanding. To develop fair and broadly applicable LALMs, future evaluations should carefully consider linguistic, cultural, and communicative diversity."

            "title": "Modalities",
            "content": "Current LALM safety evaluations (6.2) mainly target harmful content in model outputs, often overlooking risks inherent to auditory modalities. Auditory cues such as tone, emotion, and voice quality can also influence user experience and raise concerns if uncontrolled. For instance, even harmless content can discomfort users if spoken harshly or sarcastically, and the presence of annoying noises can also cause irritation. Thus, safety should cover auditory comfort, not just content harmlessness. Most benchmarks focus on content toxicity but seldom assess auditory-specific safety. Addressing these issues is vital for applications like voice assistants (Pias et al., 2024; Mari et al., 2024), where vocal manner greatly affects user trust and comfort. Future work should jointly consider vocal tone, noise, and other paralinguistic factors to ensure safe, user-friendly interactions."

        {
            "title": "Helpfulness",
            "content": "Harmlessness and helpfulness in LALMs refer to safety and fairness, and the ability to assist users, respectively. Ideally, these two properties should be enhanced together; however, in practice, they often conflict (Bai et al., 2022). For example, model that always refuses to answer is safe but unhelpful, as it fails to assist users. recent study (Lin et al., 2025b) shows that post-training aimed at enhancing harmlessness can reduce helpfulness, causing models to reject queries even when no safety or privacy issues exist. This tension highlights the need for unified evaluation framework that considers both aspects simultaneously. Existing harmlessness benchmarks (6) rarely include helpfulness, limiting understanding of their trade-offs and offering limited guidance for balancing them effectively. Thus, developing joint evaluation framework is key future direction."

            "title": "7.5 Personalization Evaluation",
            "content": "Personalization enables models to adapt to individual users by incorporating private information like users voices and preferences, supporting applications such as personalized voice assistants. While traditional speech technologies have explored personalization (Lee et al., 2024; Joseph and Baby, 2024), it remains underdeveloped for LALMs. Unlike recent progress in LLM personalization (Tan et al., 2024, 2025; Zhang et al., 2024), LALM personalization is more complex due to the auditory dimension: LALMs must adapt to userspecific knowledge, as text LLMs do, but also become familiar with users voice characteristics and speaking habits, and adjust their own speaking style to match user preferences. Such complexity necessitates the development of specialized evaluations to fully assess LALM personalization, making it valuable area for future investigation."

            "title": "8 Conclusion",
            "content": "Holistic evaluation of LALMs is as crucial as modeling and training in advancing the field. This survey reviews existing evaluation frameworks and proposes taxonomy categorizing current progress into four important research areas, reflecting the diverse expectations of LALM capabilities. We present thorough overview of the literature, highlighting challenges and future directions, such as data contamination, inclusivity, auditory-specific safety, and personalization. We hope this survey provides clear guidelines for researchers and stimulates further advancements in LALM evaluation."

        {
            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "We acknowledge few limitations in this paper. First, the scope of our taxonomy is based on existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarks, meaning it does not cover all possible real-world auditory tasks. The auditory modalities are inherently complex, with wide range of tasks and applications that cannot be exhaustively covered. As LALMs continue to evolve, new capabilities and applications will emerge, leading to growing expectations for these models. Consequently, the evaluation landscape will likely expand and shift, requiring our taxonomy to be updated and adapted to include these new tasks and applications. We will continue to follow the advancements in this field and adjust our taxonomy accordingly to reflect these developments. Second, this survey primarily focuses on current benchmarks used to evaluate LALMs performance across various aspects. As result, it does not put much emphasis on more basic or traditional evaluation methods, such as subjective assessments of speech generation quality (e.g., Mean Opinion Score), which are commonly used to evaluate model-generated audio. While these methods are valuable in certain applications, they fall outside the scope of this paper, which aims to provide comprehensive overview of more advanced and specialized benchmarks."

Including them would make the figure overly detailed and cumbersome. For reference, we provide examples of these fundamental tasks and their corresponding resources in Appendix B. From Figure 3, it is evident that the current focus of LALM evaluations predominantly centers on auditory processing tasks (3.2), underscoring their importance to the research community. While these tasks are undeniably valuable, they should not be seen as the sole consideration when evaluating models for real-world applications. more diverse and comprehensive evaluation scope is crucial to ensure fuller understanding of their potential and shortcomings."

As foundational components of auditory processing, these tasks are well-suited for adaptation in LALM evaluation, as discussed in (3.2). Dynamics in Full-Duplex Dialogues In this section, we briefly introduce the dynamics discussed in (5.1.2). Turn-taking (Sacks et al., 1974) is fundamental aspect of conversational organization, where speakers alternate turns to speak, ensuring only one person talks at time. This process is complex, involving various behaviors that help facilitate smooth transitions between speakers. For example, speakers often signal the end of their turn through clear cues, allowing the listener to and supportive dialogue. As such, backchanneling plays crucial role in sustaining conversation dynamics and promoting positive communicative exchanges. Speaker overlap refers to the simultaneous speech of multiple speakers, while speaker interruption occurs when one speaker interjects during anothers turn, which breaks the turn-taking principles (Gravano and Hirschberg, 2012). These phenomena are complex: they can be competitive, reflecting hostility or dominance (West, 1979; Orcutt and Harvey, 1985), or they can be neutral or supportive, helping to maintain and coordinate the flow of dialogue (Goldberg, 1990; Jefferson, 1986; Gervits and Scheutz, 2018). Despite their varying forms, both overlap and interruption are natural components of human conversation. Input/Output Modalities of the"

Nevertheless, modality information is essential for researchers seeking benchmarks suited to models specialized in particular modalities. Thus, we provide the input/output modality details in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5, corresponding to the categories of General Auditory Awareness and Processing (3), Knowledge and Reasoning (4), Dialogue-oriented Ability (5), and Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness (6), respectively. These tables are compiled based on the original papers of the surveyed benchmarks. Please note that due to unique evaluation designs, some benchmarks do not produce explicit outputs but instead rely on input likelihood comparisons or similarity measures with specific instances. This absence of outputs is clearly indicated in the tables."

Furthermore, turn-taking conventions may be shaped by cultural factors (Sidnell, 2007), which influence how and when speakers take their turns due to linguistic and social differences. Understanding and modeling these behaviors are essential steps toward achieving natural and effective communication in both human-human and human-AI interactions. Backchanneling involves the listeners use of phatic expressions that signal active listening and attentiveness to the speaker (Fujie et al., 2005). These brief verbal cues, such as yeah, see, or uh-huh, along with non-verbal cues like nodding, serve as feedback, demonstrating sympathy, agreement, or understanding. By offering such responses, listeners help maintain the flow of conversation without interrupting the speaker. This behavior not only fosters sense of connection but also enhances the speakers feeling of being heard and understood, contributing to more interactive General Auditory Awareness and Processing Benchmark Input Modalities Output Modalities Text Audio Speech Music Text Audio Speech Music SALMon (Maimon et al., 2025) Wu et al.
