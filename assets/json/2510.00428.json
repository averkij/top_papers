            "content": "Writing radiology report requires radiologists to accurately interpret images and synthesize them into two main components: 1) detailed findings that systematically document anatomical structures and pathological observations, and 2) concise impressions that provide clinical interpretations for subsequent decision-making (Wallis & McCoubrie, 2011; Pahadia et al., 2020; Haygood et al., 2018; Trinh et al., 2019; ESR, 2011). However, generating such comprehensive reports is both cognitively demanding and time-consuming for radiologists. Given the high volume of imaging studies and the time-intensive nature of report writing, there is critical need for automated systems that can assist radiologists by generating accurate, structured reports while reducing radiologists workload and improving diagnostic efficiency (Markotic et al., 2021; Alexander et al., 2022). 1 Figure 2: conceptual illustration of the proposed C-SRRG. (a) Radiologists routinely use clinical context, while (b) existing SRRG frameworks do not. Motivated by this gap, (c) C-SRRG leverages multi-view images, indication, technique, and variable-length prior studies/comparisons to generate structured radiology reports. Automated radiology report generation (RRG) has emerged as crucial task to address these challenges by assisting radiologists in the diagnostic workflow (Esteva et al., 2019; Sloan et al., 2024; Tanno et al., 2025). Deep learning has accelerated the development of automated RRG frameworks that generate reports directly from medical images (Shin et al., 2016; Jing et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Jing et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; 2022; Wang et al., 2022a). Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) further enhanced this capability by integrating vision foundation models with large language models capable of generating coherent and clinically relevant text (Lee et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023a; Hyland et al., 2023; Bannur et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Sellergren et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). Despite the progress, most automated RRG frameworks overlook essential clinical context such as imaging indication, technique, and prior studies that radiologists use to generate reports (Kahn et al., 2009; ESR, 2011). Ignoring the clinical context leads to systematic errors (Liu et al., 2019; Ramesh et al., 2022) as the models fail to capture patient-specific properties and longitudinal changes essential for accurate diagnosis, including temporal hallucinations where the models generate references to nonexistent priors or fabricate temporal comparisons (Figs. 22 to 24). Although some work injected partial contexte.g., multi-view images (Yuan et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2022), historical images (Hou et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023b), and prior reports or indications (Miao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024)these are still limited, e.g., only consider partial clinical context, rely only on the immediately preceding image or report (Bannur et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b;a), with all approaches targeting free-form RRG rather than structured RRG (SRRG) (Delbrouck et al., 2025). To this end, we first present C-SRRG, framework for contextualized structured radiology report generation  (Fig. 2)  , built upon the recently introduced SRRG paradigm (Delbrouck et al., 2025). We curate large-scale dataset for structured report generation with rich clinical context, by leveraging MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019) and CheXpert Plus (Chambon et al., 2024). Specifically, our C-SRRG dataset provides 1) multi-view images (frontal and lateral), 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging technique, and 4) variable-length prior studies with corresponding comparisons, which models can incorporate depending on their architecture. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed C-SRRG with state-of-the-art (SoTA) medical MLLMsincluding CheXagent-3B (Chen et al., 2024b), MedGemma-4B (Sellergren et al., 2025), and Lingshu-7B (Team et al., 2025)and find that incorporating clinical context substantially and consistently improves report quality (summarized in Fig. 1 and detailed in Tabs. 3 and 4) measured by various metrics (Papineni et al., 2002; Lin, 2004; Zhang et al., 2019; Delbrouck et al., 2022; 2025). Interestingly, the clinical context becomes increasingly critical as the models scale up from 3B to 7B. We also provide comprehensive analysis, including extensive ablation studies on clinical context (Tabs. 5 to 8), temporal hallucination mitigation (Tab. 9), and organ-level performance (Tab. 10). We will publicly release the 1) dataset, 2) code, and 3) checkpoints of benchmarked models to facilitate further research in C-SRRG and benefit the community. Our contributions and empirical findings are summarized as follows: 2 We identify key limitation of existing SRRG frameworks, i.e., the neglect of essential clinical context, which induces systematic errors, most notably temporal hallucinations about nonexistent prior studies. To address this, we introduce clinically contextualized SRRG framework (C-SRRG) that explicitly integrates clinical context into the generation process. We curate the largest structured radiology report generation dataset with rich clinical context, namely, C-SRRG dataset, which includes 1) multi-view images, 2) indication, 3) technique, and 4) prior studies/comparisons, for training and evaluation of the proposed C-SRRG framework. As summarized in Fig. 1, we provide comprehensive benchmark of SoTA MLLM-based SRRG models, demonstrating that clinical context becomes increasingly critical as models scale up enhancing report quality (e.g., +2.34.2/+1.37.1 on findings/impression for F1-SRR-BERT) while reducing temporal hallucinations (Tab. 9; e.g., 12.2%/18.0% on findings/impression)."

            "content": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Building on recent advances in LLMs (Bai et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Yang et al., 2025), MLLMs have shown strong performance across many domains, including medical applications (Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025). They integrate visual understanding with natural-language generation, enabling effective tools for medical image analysis and clinical text generation (Li et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024a; He et al., 2024; Hurst et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025). Medical-specific MLLMs further improve performance by incorporating domain knowledge and clinical expertise through specialized training procedures, including CheXagent (Chen et al., 2024b), MedGemma (Sellergren et al., 2025), and Lingshu (Team et al., 2025). These foundation models are particularly promising for comprehensive RRG frameworks (Lee et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2024c; Wang et al., 2023; Hyland et al., 2023; Bannur et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024b; Dai et al., 2025; Sellergren et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025), where their ability to accept flexible inputs and produce coherent clinical text is especially valuable. Accordingly, we benchmark medical MLLMs for contextualized SRRG. Clinical context. Radiologists routinely leverage clinical context when drafting reports, drawing upon patient history, prior studies, and clinical indications (Kahn et al., 2009; ESR, 2011; Wallis & McCoubrie, 2011; Haygood et al., 2018; Trinh et al., 2019; Pahadia et al., 2020; Castillo et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021), motivating various approaches to integrate such clinical context into automated RRG frameworks. Multi-view image analysis utilizes complementary imaging perspectives, such as frontal and lateral views, to provide comprehensive anatomical coverage (Yuan et al., 2019; Miao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2022; Nooralahzadeh et al., 2021; Serra et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024d; Nicolson et al., 2024). Indication and clinical history integration approaches incorporate patientspecific clinical information (Hou et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a; Miao et al., 2024). Previous studies enable temporal comparison and disease progression tracking (Hou et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023b; Serra et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2021). Recent works such as MLRG (Liu et al., 2025b), PriorRG (Liu et al., 2025a), and MAIRA2 (Bannur et al., 2024) have attempted to incorporate clinical context for more comprehensive report generation. However, these approaches have limitations: they either 1) consider only partial clinical 3 Structured Report (Excerpt): History: male patient with hep cirrhosis and large right pleural effusion status post thoracocentesis.

            "content": "Motivation. Our design principle is to reflect the clinical workflow of radiologists that incorporates diverse diagnostic context such as indication, technique, and comparison (Wallis & McCoubrie, 2011; Trinh et al., 2019; Pahadia et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021), supported by empirical evidence showing improvement in report quality (Castillo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). This emphasis on comprehensive clinical context aligns with recent work advocating that AI systems must move beyond narrow task-specific approaches that lack the ability to incorporate multimodal data and provide comprehensive interpretation assistance (Dogra et al., 2025). Most importantly, without this context, existing automated systems are prone to temporal hallucinations: ground truth reports frequently contain temporal statements such as new from prior exam (as shown in Fig. 3), which leads models to hallucinate by referencing nonexistent prior examination (Ramesh et al., 2022). When trained on such data, the SRRG frameworks learn to generate these temporal phrases even when no prior studies are available, as demonstrated in Figs. 25 to 30. Clinical context. To address this limitation, we incorporate rich clinical context into automatic SRRG frameworks. Specifically, we consider four clinical elements that radiologists routinely use: 1. Multi-view images (e.g., posteroanterior, anteroposterior, and lateral) provide complementary perspectives from different angles, enabling comprehensive assessment and detection of abnormalities that may be obscured in single views. Multi-view fusion captures richer information through cross-view consistency, improves pathological localization accuracy, and reduces diagnostic uncertainty (Yuan et al., 2019; Miao et al., 2024). 2. Indication conveys the clinical rationale for imaging, providing context about patient symptoms, suspected conditions, or clinical questions. This enables models to focus on specific diagnostic questions, tailor findings to physician concerns, and avoid clinically insignificant findings. 3. Technique documents examination parameters and limitations including imaging protocols, contrast use, and factors affecting image quality. It helps models note technical caveats, avoid mistaking artifacts for pathology, and prevent duplicate exams. 4. Prior studies, when available, enable temporal comparison by providing history to detect disease progression, treatment response, and interval changes. Radiologists routinely consult such history (Haygood et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2025a), which supports accurate change detection and prevents hallucinations referencing nonexistent prior exams.

Figure 5: Distribution of the number of prior studies available per sample for findings and impression. Dataset curation. We build on the recently proposed SRRG dataset (Delbrouck et al., 2025), which includes both MIMIC (Johnson et al., 2019) and CheXpert Plus (Chambon et al., 2024). We employ dataset-specific approaches to extract the necessary clinical context. When multiple views are available, we integrate multi-view images using ViewPosition for MIMIC and frontal lateral, ap pa for CheXpert Plus. For MIMIC, each patient is identified by unique subject id with associated StudyDate and StudyTime fields. We group patients by subject id, then use temporally-ordered StudyDate and StudyTime to establish chronological sequences. For CheXpert Plus, each study contains deid patient id and patient report date order field. We group studies by patient and use the order of report dates to form longitudinal sequences. For other clinical contexts (indication, technique, comparison), we use SRRG components, parsed from free-form reports using GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023). Dataset analysis. Accordingly, we curate two C-SRRG tasks that mirror clinical practiceC-SRRG-Findings and CSRRG-Impression with train, valid, test, and test-reviewed1 splits, as summarized in Tab. 1. The splits enforce the strict separation of patients between training and evaluation to prevent data leakage and properly assess generalization, as in Fig. 10. The availability of clinical context varies across splits and tasks  (Fig. 4)  . The availability of prior studies follows Figure 6: Distribution of the number of studies per patient. 1The test-reviewed split reports are reviewed by board-certified radiologists (Delbrouck et al., 2025). 5 SYSTEM PROMPT: You are an expert radiologist.

We construct prompt templates for four core settings: 1) findings prompts with prior studies  (Fig. 11)  , 2) findings prompts without prior studies  (Fig. 12)  , 3) impression prompts with prior studies  (Fig. 7)  , and 4) impression prompts without prior studies  (Fig. 13)  .

When available, it incorporates prior studies that also include indication, technique, comparison, and reports on findings or impression  (Fig. 14)  . These structured components are concatenated to form single multimodal token sequence. As shown in Figs. 9 and 15, the response format is standardized for the generation of structured reports. Detailed examples of prompt structures and integration of clinical context can be found in and E. Training and inference. We fine-tune medical MLLMs on these contextualized promptresponse pairs for both findings and impression tasks. Models receive prompt and clinical context to form unified multimodal input sequence. The training objective is then the next-token prediction task under an autoregressive language modeling loss: 1 t=1 log pÎ¸(ytx, y<t), where is the mulT timodal token sequence comprising the prompt (Figs. 7 and 11 to 13), the clinical context of the current study  (Fig. 8)  and any prior studies  (Fig. 14)  , and y1:T is the target token sequence (e.g., reports on findings or impression; Figs. 9 and 15). Here, pÎ¸ denotes the MLLM parameterized by Î¸. We minimize the negative log-likelihood with respect to Î¸, i.e., standard cross-entropy over the vocabulary. If prior studies are available, they are inserted into designated slots; otherwise, the model receives only the clinical context of the current study. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous clinical contexts (Figs. 4 to 6), to produce context-aware reports when there is prior information, and to avoid hallucinated temporal comparisons when not.

Tab. 3 demonstrates substantial improvements achieved by C-SRRG on the C-SRRG-Findings across all evaluation metrics, except for slight BLEU decreases for CheXagent-3B on the test/test-reviewed splits (-0.19/-0.15). For example, F1-SRR-BERT scores improve by +3.33/+1.37/+2.28 (CheXagent-3B), +6.30/+3.24/+3.04 (MedGemma-4B), and +9.91/+4.98/+4.17 (Lingshu-7B), with larger models consistently showing greater gains. Category Score performance likewise improves by +3.19/+0.99/+2.38 (CheXagent-3B), +4.09/+2.15/+1.80 (MedGemma-4B), and +7.30/+2.84/+2.44 (Lingshu-7B). Results on the C-SRRG-Impression. Tab. 4 also shows significant gains achieved by our CSRRG on the C-SRRG-Impression. F1-SRR-BERT improves by +0.8/+3.12 (CheXagent-3B), +5.5/+4.43/+4.69 (MedGemma-4B), and +7.42/+7.68/+6.16 (Lingshu-7B) except for CheXagent3B on the valid split (-0.06). CheXagent-3B also exhibits similar BLEU score decreases on the C-SRRG-Findings (Tab. 3), indicating that rich clinical context may compromise text generation fluency in smaller models. Importantly, while performance consistently drops as models scale up without clinical context from 3B to 7B parameters, it improves substantially with context, suggesting the critical importance of clinical context in scaling up MLLMs for SRRG. 7 Table 4: Results on the C-SRRG-Impression.

We next conduct ablation studies with four settings: 1) train+eval without context (baseline); 2) train with, eval without; 3) train without, eval with; and 4) train+eval with context. Tabs. 5 and 6 report F1-SRR-BERT on C-SRRG-Findings and C-SRRG-Impression using MedGemma-4B. We find incorporating clinical context in only one phase provides limited improvement or slight degradation: e.g., +3.23/+0.45/+0.53 (train ), or +1.44/+0.25/-0.56 (test ) in findings and +1.65/-1.05/+1.66 (train ), or +2.29/-0.1/+1.15 (test ) in impression, which shows the benefit of using context in both phases for SRRG performance. Impact of Each Clinical Context Component. We ablate four clinical-context components, 1) multi-view images, 2) indication, 3) technique, and 4) prior studies with comparison, to isolate their contributions on the performance. Tabs. 7 and 8 report F1-SRR-BERT for each variant on the C-SRRG-Findings, C-SRRG-Impression, respectively. All components contribute incrementally to both tasks (except for few cases), with performance being highest when using all available context, which shows the importance of incorporating clinical context in SRRG. Split Task Findings Mitigation Baseline () C-SRRG () Temporal Hallucination Rate Valid Test Test-reviewed Overall 146/976 (15.0%) 416/1459 (28.5%) 49/233 (21.0%) 611/2668 (22.9%) 70/976 (7.2%) 194/1459 (13.3%) (9.0%) 21/233 285/2668 (10.7%) Table 9: Mitigation effect of temporal hallucination. Mitigation of temporal hallucinations. To quantify temporal hallucinations, we train MedGemma-4B under two conditions: without clinical context (baseline) and with clinical context (C-SRRG). We evaluate both on evaluation sets without clinical context, and count reports that contain one of the following 33 indicators: 1) time references (new, newly, recent, recently, previous, prior, interval, compared to, since, from prior), 2) stability indicators (unchanged, stable, persistent, persisting), and 3) change indicators (improved, improvement, worsened, worsening, increased, decreased, enlarging, reducing, progression, regression, evolving, evolve, developing, developed, resolving, resolved, temporal change, compare, comparison). By this, we can detect whether the generated reports contained hallucinations by identifying inappropriate temporal references in the absence of clinical context. Tab. 9 shows that clinical context substantially mitigates hallucinations: Findings drop from 22.9% to 10.7% (12.2%) and Impression from 43.8% to 25.8% (18.0%). This shows that C-SRRG effectively handles heterogeneous clinical context availability, i.e., the absence of clinical context, while successfully mitigating temporal hallucinations. 364/1505 (24.2%) 599/2219 (27.0%) 58/231 (25.1%) 1021/3955 (25.8%) 630/1505 (41.9%) 1012/2219 (45.6%) 92/231 (39.8%) 1734/3955 (43.8%) Valid Test Test-reviewed Overall -7.8% -15.2% -12.0% -12.2% -17.7% -18.6% -14.7% -18.0% Impression Region Baseline () Table 10: Organ-level Category Score on the Valid split. Anatomical region analysis. We compare organ-level performance for findings task against the baseline using the SRRG anatomical categories (Delbrouck et al., 2025). Tab. 10 reports the Category Score on the validation split using MedGemma4B, with abbreviations: = pleura, = abdominal, H/M = hila/mediastinum, = Other, L/A = lungs/airways, = cardiovascular, M/C = musculoskeletal/chest wall, T/C/S = tubes/catheters/support devices. We observe that incorporating clinical context with proposed C-SRRG improves the performance across all the anatomical regions, except for H/M.

            "title": "5 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK",
            "content": "We introduced contextualized structured radiology report generation (C-SRRG), framework that aligns with radiologists diagnostic workflow by integrating rich clinical context including multiview images, indication, imaging technique, and prior studies with comparisons. Through comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, we demonstrate that clinical context integration consistently enhances text quality, diagnostic accuracy, and reduces temporal hallucinations. Importantly, our findings reveal that clinical context becomes increasingly critical as models scale up, suggesting that larger foundation models require more sophisticated contextual integration to achieve optimal performance. We will publicly release our dataset, code, and model checkpoints to foster further research in C-SRRG and benefit the broader community. Limitations. The C-SRRG dataset relies on synthetic LLM annotations from reformulated reports, which may introduce biases and subtle hallucinations. Our supervised fine-tuning approach with greedy decoding may limit the full capture of clinical reasoning processes. Computational and architectural constraints limited our evaluation to 7B parameter models with restricted multiple image processing capabilities (e.g., Lingshu-7B and CheXagent-3B limited to 2 images) and context windows that constrain comprehensive longitudinal history integration. Additionally, our recencybased selection strategy for prioritizing recent studies, while capturing clinically relevant temporal information, may occasionally omit important historical context. Future work should explore scaling to larger foundation models with extended-context capabilities, developing intelligent clinical context selection policies through learned strategies or retrievalaugmented approaches, and incorporating preference learning techniques with radiologists feedback. Expanding to comprehensive clinical modalities also presents promising avenues for enhanced diagnostic accuracy, with detailed discussions provided in A."

All experimental configurations are specified in 4.1, including model hyperparameters (learning rate 2e-4, batch size 128, LoRA rank 32), exact data splits with patient-level separation, and standard evaluation metrics. We commit to publicly releasing our complete codebase, the C-SRRG dataset with clinical context annotations, trained model checkpoints, and documentation for dataset recreation. All experiments use reproducible libraries (Hugging Face PEFT (Mangrulkar et al., 2022), vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023)) on single NVIDIA H100 GPU with fixed random seeds."

            "title": "ETHICS STATEMENT",
            "content": "Our work presents no new ethical concerns as C-SRRG is built entirely from existing de-identified public datasets (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) that have undergone rigorous de-identification and received appropriate IRB approvals. No additional patient data was collected for this work, and all privacy protections from the source datasets are maintained. We acknowledge that automated report generation systems may produce hallucinations when referencing non-existent prior studies, which our work specifically addresses by incorporating comprehensive clinical context. Our dataset and models are intended solely for research purposes and should not be used for clinical decisionmaking without appropriate validation and regulatory approval. The computational requirements are modest (single GPU training), minimizing environmental impact while maintaining research accessibility."

            "title": "A LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS",
            "content": "A.1 SYNTHETIC DATASET AND ANNOTATIONS Our C-SRRG dataset builds upon the SRRG dataset (Delbrouck et al., 2025), which was generated through reformulation of free-form radiology reports using large language models. This synthetic generation process introduces several potential limitations that warrant careful consideration. The use of LLM-generated content may introduce subtle hallucinations or inconsistencies that could propagate through our training pipeline. Additionally, the reformulation process may inadvertently introduce biases present in the underlying language models, potentially affecting the diversity and clinical accuracy of the generated reports. A.2 MODEL ARCHITECTURE AND SCALE LIMITATIONS Our experimental evaluation faces several architectural constraints that limit the full potential of our approach. First, we are constrained to backbone models with parameters up to 7B, which likely underestimates achievable performance. The computational and memory requirements of larger models present practical limitations for comprehensive evaluation across multiple architectures and clinical contexts. Second, the multimodal large language models employed were not originally designed to handle multiple images simultaneously. In our experiments, we encountered specific limitations requiring tailored approaches. Lingshu-7B (Team et al., 2025) was limited to 2 images due to computational efficiency constraints, while CheXagent-3B (Chen et al., 2024b) was similarly restricted to 2 images due to model constraints. In contrast, MedGemma-4B (Sellergren et al., 2025) demonstrated multiimage processing capabilities, requiring fewer tokens per image and enabling the use of more images in our longitudinal analysis setting. These parameter and architectural constraints particularly impact the models ability to effectively integrate complex temporal relationships and multi-modal clinical information across current and prior studies. However, ongoing research trends in long-context LLM development (Dao et al., 2022; Kwon et al., 2023) suggest that future model architectures will naturally address these limitations. Scaling to larger foundation models, exploring mixture-of-experts variants, and advances in multimodal attention mechanisms represent promising directions for substantial improvements. A.3 CLINICAL CONTEXT INTEGRATION AND SELECTION LIMITATIONS Our approach faces constraints in both the scope and selection of clinical contexts. We impose limits on the number of images and prior studies included per clinical case, with prioritization given to the most recent studies. This limitation stems from current multimodal architectures context window constraints and computational overhead of processing extensive longitudinal histories. While this recency-based selection strategy captures the most clinically relevant temporal information, it may occasionally omit important historical context that could inform diagnostic reasoning. Additionally, our current implementation primarily utilizes publicly available datasets such as MIMICCXR (Johnson et al., 2019) and CheXpert-Plus (Chambon et al., 2024), limiting the diversity of clinical contexts. 19 The scope could be significantly expanded to include additional clinical modalities such as CT imaging, Electronic Health Records (EHR) (Hayrinen et al., 2008), and comprehensive patient histories. Future work should explore learned selection policies that intelligently identify the most informative clinical contexts and optimize longitudinal coverage. Retrieval-augmented generation approaches over Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) (Andriole, 2023) and EHR systems could dynamically surface the most relevant historical information for each case, unlocking the untapped potential for richer clinical context integration. A.4 TRAINING METHODOLOGY AND DECODING LIMITATIONS Our training approach is restricted to supervised fine-tuning with greedy decoding for reproducibility and computational efficiency. This methodology, while providing stable and consistent results, may not fully capture the nuanced decision-making processes that characterize expert radiological interpretation. The supervised learning paradigm limits the models ability to learn from comparative feedback and iterative refinement that occurs in clinical practice. Incorporating preference learning techniques and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods with radiologists feedback, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), could enhance the fidelity and clinical appropriateness of generated reports. Furthermore, exploring retrieval-conditioned decoding strategies could improve temporal consistency and reduce hallucinations by grounding generation in verified clinical contexts. LIMITATION IN CHEXAGENT-3B ON C-SRRG-IMPRESSION While most models show improvement with clinical context, CheXagent-3B exhibits critical failure in following the structured report format instructions when provided with full clinical context. Instead of generating properly formatted impression sections with numbered findings, the model frequently produces single-word outputs or generic phrases. For instance, when the expected format is multi-point structured impression such as 1. Slight decrease in size of the right apicolateral pneumothorax with chest tube in place. 2. Unchanged multifocal right-sided pulmonary opacities..., CheXagent-3B often generates only Pneumothorax or Pneumonia. This format degradation is widespread, with the model generating non-structured outputs like No acute cardiopulmonary process or Pulmonary edema rather than detailed clinical impressions. Table 11: Performance degradation of CheXagent-3B on C-SRRG-Impression with full clinical context. The model shows dramatic drops across all metrics when provided with complete clinical context. Model Full Clinical Context Split BLEU ROUGE-L CheXagent-3B Valid Test Test-reviewed Valid Test Test-reviewed 9.44 7.83 7.42 2.57 2.40 2. 34.03 29.40 28.60 21.76 17.54 19.61 Traditional Metrics F1-SRR-BERT BERT Score 61.82 59.82 58.35 40.10 33.79 37.88 F1RadGraph Precision Recall 19.30 16.13 13.71 13.10 9.78 11.87 63.80 57.18 51.32 74.48 66.56 64.18 63.48 59.18 56.34 49.40 41.04 41.27 F1Score 59.10 54.27 49.74 54.05 45.99 46. The performance metrics in Tab. 11 reveal the severity of this issue: when provided with full clinical context, traditional metrics plummet dramatically (BLEU: 9.442.57, ROUGE-L: 34.0321.76, BERTScore: 61.8240.10 on validation set). This catastrophic degradation suggests that CheXagent-3B, likely trained primarily on shorter sequence lengths, struggles to process and integrate the extensive clinical context while maintaining adherence to the structured output format. The models inability to handle long input sequences effectively undermines its utility for clinical applications requiring comprehensive context integration."

            "content": "We provide detailed statistics of our clinical context chest X-ray dataset, focusing on patient distribution across splits. 20 Patient Distribution Across Splits. Our dataset maintains strict patient-level separation across training, validation, and test splits to prevent data leakage. As shown in the patient overlap heatmaps, the training set contains 83,147 unique patients for findings and 125,947 unique patients for impression tasks. The validation sets include 434 patients for findings and 477 patients for impression, while the test sets contain 274 patients for findings and 423 patients for impression. The testreviewed splits comprise 173 patients for findings and 172 patients for impression, with 106 and 108 patients respectively shared with the test split. This patient-level split ensures that clinical studies from the same patient do not appear across different evaluation splits, with zero patient overlap between training and evaluation sets. The distribution maintains clinical diversity while preserving the integrity of comprehensive clinical contexts within patient histories.

            "title": "F HALLUCINATION ANALYSIS",
            "content": "In this section, we examine critical limitation of radiology report generation models trained without clinical context, specifically their tendency to hallucinate temporal comparisons when referencing non-existent prior studies. We first demonstrate that dataset ground truth reports contain temporal statements that become hallucinations when clinical context is absent, as radiologists naturally write these comparisons when they have access to prior studies. We then analyze how models trained without such clinical context systematically produce these hallucinations, even for patients with no imaging history. Finally, we quantify these hallucinations by detecting the frequency of temporal statements on the generated reports on the evaluation set without clinical context. Dataset Hallucination. Ground truth radiology reports in clinical datasets frequently contain temporal statements such as new from prior exam, unchanged, or stable compared to previous study. These temporal references are clinically appropriate when radiologists have access to prior imaging studies for comparison. However, when language models are trained on these reports without access to the corresponding clinical context and prior studies, they learn to replicate these 23 Findings Example - Part 2: Previous Study 1 === PREVIOUS STUDY 1 (Most Recent) === Previous Clinical History/Indication: Patient with history of multifocal after CABG, currently presenting with symptoms suggestive of CHF or pneumonia. Previous Technique: single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.

This training paradigm creates systematic hallucination problem where models generate temporal comparison statements even for patients with no prior imaging history. The following examples demonstrate these temporal hallucinations present in ground truth radiology reports from the dataset, showing how temporal comparison statements appear without proper clinical context (Figs. 22 to 24): Trained Model Hallucination. Our trained models also exhibit hallucination patterns, particularly when generating temporal comparisons despite having access only to the current study. The following examples from MedGemma-4B model trained without clinical history demonstrate how models can inappropriately generate comparative language even when no prior studies are available for comparison (Figs. 25 to 30): Findings Example - Part 3: Previous Study 2 & Response === PREVIOUS STUDY 2 === Previous Clinical History/Indication: The patient presents with tachycardia.
