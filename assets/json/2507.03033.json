Introduction The administrative burden of clinical documentation has reached crisis proportions in modern healthcare, with physicians dedicating 50% of their time to electronic health record (EHR) tasks[1]. This documentation burden contributes significantly to physician burnout, with studies indicating that for every hour of direct patient care, clinicians spend nearly two hours on EHR-related activities [2,3]. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents opportunities to automate clinical documentation, particularly through the generation of structured clinical notes from physician-patient conversations [4]. Current AI-powered transcription solutions, while demonstrating impressive capabilities, face significant adoption barriers in healthcare settings. Cloud-based systems raise substantial privacy concerns given the sensitive nature of patient data and strict regulatory requirements under HIPAA and similar frameworks [6]. Cloud-based solutions require transmitting patient data to external servers, raising concerns about data breaches and unauthorized access. Additionally, the computational requirements and associated costs of state-of-the-art models create accessibility barriers for smaller healthcare practices and resource-constrained environments . The advent of smaller, more efficient LLMs has opened new possibilities for on-device deployment. Models like Llama 3.2 1B demonstrate that significant language understanding capabilities can be achieved with substantially reduced computational requirements [5]. When combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), these models can be adapted for specialized medical tasks while maintaining feasibility for local deployment [7]. This study presents the development and evaluation of an on-device medical transcription system built upon fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model. Our approach addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective clinical documentation tools that can operate entirely on local hardware in browser without compromising patient data security or requiring ongoing subscription costs. 2.

            "content": "The application of LLMs to healthcare has gained significant traction in recent years. Google's Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2 demonstrated that LLMs could achieve physician-level performance on medical question-answering tasks [8]. Similarly, Microsoft's BioGPT showed promising results in biomedical text generation and mining [9]. However, these models typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Recent work has focused on developing more compact medical LLMs. Chen et al. introduced MedAlpaca, 7B parameter model fine-tuned on medical data [10]. While more efficient than larger models, it still requires dedicated GPU resources for real-time inference. The ChatDoctor model by Li et al. demonstrated that fine-tuning on medical conversations could improve domain-specific performance [11].The Sound of Healthcare study showed that LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance in medical transcription tasks, particularly in speaker diarization and Word Error Rate reduction using Chain-of-Thought prompting [12]. Other opensource efforts have explored finetuning compact LLMs (7B mistral model) for specialtyspecific note generation, demonstrating gains compared to similarly sized baselines [13]. These findings establish the technical feasibility of LLM-based medical transcription while highlighting the importance of domain-specific adaptation."

This dataset focuses on endocrinology cases, providing domain-specific examples of physician-patient conversations and their corresponding clinical documentation. The dataset was generated through an iterative, multi-stage data synthesis and refinement workflow. First, realistic endocrinology consultation topics were created, focusing on common disorders, symptoms, treatments, and lifestyle discussions typical in clinical visits. Detailed contextual descriptions were then developed for each topic to guide accurate and relevant transcript generation. Using advanced LLM prompting, natural and unedited endocrinology consultations were synthesized, incorporating labs, discussions, medication plans, and follow-up instructions while reflecting real conversational nuances such as interruptions and clarifications. Each generated transcript underwent an automated critique and revision loop, where completeness, clinical relevance, and realism were evaluated and iteratively improved based on feedback to enhance overall data fidelity. Finally, the refined transcripts were transformed into standardized, structured endocrinology notes formatted with key clinical sections typically seen in structured medical note. To validate the quality and clinical accuracy of our generation methodology, we initially produced 20 transcriptions and corresponding notes utilizing this workflow. These samples underwent evaluation by an endocrinologist to assess their medical accuracy, clinical realism, and adherence to appropriate documentation standards. Only upon receiving approval and confirmation that the generated content satisfied professional clinical standards did we proceed to expand the dataset to 1,500 samples, thereby ensuring the robustness and suitability of our generation methodology for large-scale application."

Major hallucinations decreased dramatically from 85 to 35 cases on the ACI benchmark (-58.8%) and from 33 to 5 cases on the internal evaluation dataset (-84.8%). Similarly, major omissions were substantially reduced from 107 to 21 cases (-80.4%) and from 71 to 1 case (-98.6%) respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the number and type of hallucinations in outputs from each model for ACI and internal evaluation datasets. 5. Discussion Our evaluation demonstrates that the OnDevice model achieved consistent performance improvements across datasets, with particularly notable enhancements in clinical safety through reduced hallucinations and omissions. Given that studies estimate human-generated clinical notes have, on average, at least 1 error and 4 omissions, our focus on reducing hallucinations and omissions in automated transcription addresses critical clinical need [24]. The model showed improved semantic understanding beyond lexical matching, and domain-specific training on endocrinology cases successfully translated to better performance on specialized evaluation tasks. The improvement in factual correctness and clinical relevance suggests that domain-specific fine-tuning can effectively adapt general-purpose models for specialized medical tasks. The ability to achieve these improvements with 1B parameter model is particularly significant for healthcare adoption. Traditional concerns about computational requirements and deployment costs are substantially mitigated, making the technology accessible to smaller practices and resource-constrained environments. The on-device deployment model addresses fundamental privacy concerns in healthcare AI. By processing all data locally, the system eliminates risks associated with cloud-based processing while ensuring compliance with HIPAA and similar regulatory frameworks. This approach provides complete data sovereignty, allowing healthcare organizations to benefit from AI capabilities without compromising patient privacy. Our work demonstrates several key technical contributions. The successful application of LoRA fine-tuning to medical transcription tasks shows that parameter-efficient methods can achieve substantial performance improvements with limited computational resources. Additionally, we developed comprehensive evaluation framework that combines automated metrics with LLM-as-judge evaluation using GPT-4.1, providing robust assessment methodology for clinical AI systems. Our emphasis on hallucination and omission analysis addresses critical concerns for medical AI deployment. To ensure reproducibility, we have made the evaluation code and prompts for the GPT-4.1 judge publicly available in the supplementary materials, enabling other researchers to replicate our assessment approach. Several limitations should be acknowledged in this work. The evaluation focused primarily on endocrinology cases, and generalization to other medical specialties requires further validation. The training dataset of 1,500 examples, while sufficient for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, may limit the model's exposure to diverse clinical scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-as-judge evaluation, while comprehensive, may not capture all aspects of clinical utility that would be apparent to human clinicians. Finally, the evaluation was conducted on curated datasets and may not fully reflect the challenges of real-world clinical transcription environments. Future research should address several key areas to advance this work. Expanding evaluation to multiple medical specialties will be essential to assess the model's generalization capabilities beyond endocrinology. Additionally, conducting real-world clinical trials with practicing clinicians will provide crucial insights into practical utility and workflow integration challenges. Finally, developing frameworks for continuous learning that enable ongoing model improvement based on clinical feedback while maintaining patient privacy will be critical for long-term deployment success. 6. Conclusion This study demonstrates that fine-tuning compact large language models for structured medical note creation can achieve substantial improvements in clinical documentation quality while enabling complete on-device deployment. The OnDevice model showed consistent improvements across automated metrics, clinical quality assessments, and safety measures, with particularly notable reductions in major hallucinations and omissions. The ability to achieve these results with 1B parameter model addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy concerns, computational requirements, and ongoing costs. By enabling local deployment performance, this approach makes advanced AI-powered clinical documentation accessible to healthcare organizations of all sizes. The open-source release of the model, training data, evaluation framework, and browser-based deployment software provides foundation for broader adoption and further research. This work contributes to the growing body of evidence that privacy-preserving, on-device AI can deliver clinically meaningful improvements in healthcare workflows while maintaining data security and patient privacy."
