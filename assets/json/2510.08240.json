            "title": "1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) present immense potential for both positive impact, and significant risks if\nnot managed responsibly (WhiteHouse, 2024; Li et al., 2024a, i.a.). Harnessing their benefits while mitigating\nrisks introduces a fundamental tension between being helpful and harmless (Bai et al., 2022), which manifests\nin two critical challenges. First, LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to circumvent their\nsafety alignment (e.g., via role-playing prompts), leading them to produce unsafe content (Ganguli et al.,\n2022; Perez et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023; Andriushchenko et al., 2025). Second, safety-aligned LLMs can be\noversensitive to benign prompts that are similar to harmful ones (e.g., “How can I steal someone’s heart?”)\nand refuse to provide a helpful answer, known as overrefusal (Röttger et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2025; Xie et al.,\n2025). These competing challenges create a direct trade-off, because over-addressing the risk of unsafe content\nexacerbates the model’s tendency to overrefuse benign prompts (Li et al., 2024b; Knight et al., 2025).",
            "content": "A common paradigm to defend against adversarial attacks is employing standalone safeguard model, such as Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023; Meta Llama Team, 2025) or Constitutional Classifiers (Sharma et al., 2025), on top of the LLM conversation agent (Han et al., 2024; Padhi et al., 2024, i.a.). The safeguard model classifies prompts and responses for safety and converts all contents deemed unsafe into refusals. However, because responses that might involve potential risk are completely blocked, safeguards can only exacerbate overrefusals. This issue is particularly pronounced with dual-use promptsquestions on sensitive topics with 1 Figure 1 Overview of WaltzRL. Left: Given user prompt, the conversation agent produces an initial response. The feedback agent then reasons about its safety and overrefusal, produces labels, and textual feedback. If the initial response is deemed unsafe or overrefusing according to the label, the feedback is given to the conversation agent which produces revised response. Here, the feedback agent converts an unsafe response into safe, balanced response to an adversarial prompt (detailed in F). Right: single training step of WaltzRL. After collaborative rollout, we gather training samples, compute the reward separately for each agent, and train both agents in parallel. unclear intent that can lead to both benign and malicious use cases, and with long helpful response that contains minor section of risky content (Mu et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2025; Duan et al., 2025). Bluntly blocking the entire response deprives the user of all the safe and helpful information. To orchestrate this elegant balance between helpfulness and harmlessness, we formulate safety alignment as positive-sum game between two agents working in collaboration. Our proposed method, WaltzRL, trains feedback agent to give safety feedback and conversation agent to incorporate useful feedback  (Fig. 1)  . The response is enhanced over multiple rounds of feedback when needed, allowing our system to reduce both unsafe responses and overrefusals in an adaptive manner. We propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) recipe where both agents are updated in each RL step, enabling agents to co-evolve with different specializations. At the core of WaltzRL is Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) for the feedback agent that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the reward. DIR is shaped by the difference of the conversation agent reward after and before incorporating feedback, encouraging the feedback agents to generate suggestions that are helpful for the conversation agent. We develop two-stage RL pipeline that enables the feedback agent to give feedback adaptively (2.4), preserving general helpfulness and latency. WaltzRL not only enhances the initial responses from the conversation agent, but also deploys both the conversation and feedback agents jointly at inference to further improve helpfulness and harmlessness. This two-agent framework, which stands in contrast to prior works that perform multi-agent training but deploy only single defender model (Zheng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025), forces an attack to jailbreak both agents to be successful (Mangaokar et al., 2024). As shown in 3, WaltzRL indeed achieves enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks. We conduct experiments that evaluate how WaltzRL balances helpfulness and harmlessness compared to baselines. Across 5 diverse datasets containing challenging adversarial attacks and borderline prompts that models tend to over-refuse, our multi-agent WaltzRL recipe significantly reduces both safety violations (39.0% with the base model 4.6% with ours on WildJailbreak (Jiang et al., 2024)) and overrefusals (45.3% 9.9% on OR-Bench (Cui et al., 2025)). Detailed in 3.2, rich feedback generated by the feedback agent is crucial for steering the conversation agent to produce the correct revision. Moreover, even without including helpfulness data during RL, WaltzRL still preserves the general capability of the conversation agent. Our experiments reveal important insights on the helpfulness-harmlessness balance: (1) We validate that existing safeguards indeed reduce unsafe responses but at the cost of higher overrefusal 2 rate. In addition, if the system without safeguard already has low overrefusal, safeguards have an even larger negative effect on exacerbating overrefusal. (2) We find that inference-time collaboration with our protocol without RL can already reduce both unsafe and overrefusing responses, but feedback is triggered excessively. Our proposed WaltzRL training not only further enhances safety and reduce overrefusal but also improves the efficiency by preventing over-triggered feedback. (3) We find that an oracle baseline, where the feedback is template sentence converted from ground-truth safety and overrefusal labels, underperforms WaltzRL. This illustrates that detailed feedback is crucial for improving the conversation agents responsesespecially important for convincing the conversation agent to flip overrefusals into benign helpful responses. This work makes three primary contributions. First, we propose WaltzRL, multi-agent RL framework that jointly optimizes two agents for safety alignment. Further, we propose novel Dynamic Improvement Reward formulation that incentivizes collaboration, where the feedback agent is rewarded by the improvements its suggestions bring to the conversation agents response. Finally, we show that WaltzRL is promising method to enhance LLM safety without degrading other capabilities, lifting the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness."

            "content": "We formulate collaborative safety alignment as positive-sum multi-agent game, where the conversation agent and feedback agent are cooperating to achieve two separate and non-competing rewards. Specifically, let be user prompt, ct be the t-th round revision from the conversation agent for p, and ft be the t-th round feedback from the feedback agent. Let the partial trajectory Ht1 := (c0, f0, c1, f1, , ct1, ft1) be the feedback process between the conversation and feedback agent up to revision 1. Let Rc ((p, Ht1), ct) denote the reward for the conversation agent, acting on state ((p, Ht1), ct). Similarly, let Rf ((p, Ht1, ct), ft) be the reward given to the feedback agent based on the feedback ft made on ct. π := (p, πc, πf ) is random variable for the number of revision rounds that happened, jointly determined by the conversation agent and the feedback agent for prompt p. The goal of collaborative alignment is to solve the following problem: max πc,πf pD ctπc ftπf π(cid:88) (cid:0)(p, Ht1), ct (cid:1) + Rf (cid:0)(p, Ht1, ct), ft Rc (cid:1) βKL(πcπref ) βKL(πf πref ) . (1) t=0 We specify the rewards Rc and Rf in 2.2 and our approach for optimizing equation 1 in 2.3. Initialization and task format We initialize the conversation agent and feedback agent with different system prompts (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) as the initial collaboration framework between the two agents. The collaboration will be further reinforced with our multi-agent RL framework (2.3). We require the feedback agent to output JSON containing the following fields: reasoning: the feedback agents reasoning trace over the initial response. unsafe and overrefuse: two true/false labels predicting whether the last-round conversation agent response is unsafe, overrefusing, or satisfactory (safe and not overrefusing). We define two labels instead of one to differentiate the above three cases. This is used to determine whether the initial response needs feedback, and enables adaptive test-time feedback inclusion. 3 feedback: the actual feedback string that will be fed back to the conversation agent. During the generation of ci+1, only the feedback string portion of fi is fed back into the history of the conversation agent, whereas the reasoning, unsafe and overrefuse annotations by the feedback agent are kept privte to itself. This enables the feedback agent reason freely and extensively on its own, and only then communicate summary feedback that would affect the conversations agent. We defer further details of agent initialization to A. Adaptive stopping condition for feedback The feedback process is stopped if the feedback agent determines that the conversation agent response is satisfactory, i.e., it predicts unsafe=False and overrefuse=False, or when the maximum rounds of feedback Tmax has been reached. In early stages of training, we also stop the conversation if the feedback agents response is an invalid format."

Consequently, as training progresses, RDIR will change dynamically as the conversation agent policy is updated. Determined by our adaptive stopping condition (detailed in 2.4), if the conversation has stopped and ct+1 does not exist, then RDIR is crucial for steering the feedback agent to produce useful feedback for collaboration between the two agents. In addition, to enable feedback adaptivity, the feedback agent needs to produce accurate flags to determine when to stop giving feedback. Hence, we include additional reward shaping terms on label and format. Let L(ft) denote the safety and overrefusal flags produced by the feedback agent according to the JSON schema described in section 2.1, the label ((p, Ht1, ct), ft) = 1{L(ft) = J(p, ct)}, where we reward the feedback agent if reward is defined as Rlabel its predicted flags of last conversation agent revision ct aligns with the LLM judge. The format reward is Rformat = 1{ft is parsable and well-formed JSON}. is set to 0.

(III) Finally, we treat each agent as separate actor, and perform alternating policy gradient steps for each agent. Note that the policy gradient step of each agent can be executed in parallel, enhancing training throughput. We detail the mathematical updates and implementation for each agent in B. (I) Collaborative rollout At the start of each iteration, we produce feedback process between the conversation agent and the feedback agent, by first prompting the conversation agent with the user question to produce the initial response, then passing in the message from the other agent from the previous revision in alternating order, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The rollout creates feedback-revision trajectory (p, c0, f0, . . . , ct, ft, . . . , fT 1, cT ) = (p, HT 1, cT ). (II) Gathering RL states and actions We now reduce the multi-agent collaborative trajectories into single-agent trajectories for each agent. For the feedback agent, we reduce from the full trajectory (p, c0, f0, . . . , fT 1, cT ) to an initial state (p, ct). The learnable actions for the feedback agent are each token in its generated feedback ft. That is, τt = ((p, ct), ft). We randomly choose one round {0, . . . , 1} as the final feedback agent trajectory τf . For the conversation agent, we augment each rollout into two types of state-action pairs: A: The initial state is the user prompt p, and the learnable actions are each token in the initial conversation response c0, denoted as τA = (p, c0). B: The initial state is the user prompt and the entire feedback process (p, HT 1) = (p, c0, . . . , fT 1), and the learnable actions are each token in the final conversation agent response cT , denoted as τB = ((p, c0, . . . , fT 1), cT ). We blend training samples from both and B, so that the conversation agent learns to both generate satisfying initial responses (A), and also incorporate useful feedback (B) only when it is necessary. That is, we randomly choose one of τA and τB as the conversation agent trajectory τc. (III) Two-agent policy gradient step We describe our extension of the REINFORCE++ (Hu et al., 2025a) algorithm to the two-agent setting in this section. After the sample collection stage (II) above, the collaborative trajectory has been reduced to single-agent trajectories τc, τf . Hence, the optimization problem in (1) over πc and πf over common trajectory (p, c0, f0, . . . , fT 1, cT ) is reduced to sub-problems over θc and θf .

Stage 2: multi-agent collaborative alignment. In this stage, we conduct collaborative training between the two agents while setting λ = 0 in the feedback agent reward (eqn. 2), effectively disabling the additive label reward. During Stage 2 training, as the reward of the conversation agent improves, there will be gradually less prevalent amount of conversation agent responses that require revision, which are less likely to be flagged as unsafe or overrefusal by the feedback agent. Disabling the label reward can prevent the feedback agent internal flag overfitting to imbalanced data.

We find this result particularly promising because WaltzRL does not use any helpfulness prompt during RL and still shows little helpfulness degradation. This indicates that training separate feedback agent focused on safety is promising direction to improve safety without degrading helpfulness. In Table 4, we also show that our adaptive feedback mechanism is rarely triggered on non-safety prompts in AlpacaEval, leading to little degradation of win rate. Adaptivity and latency considerations We find WaltzRL significantly reduces the feedback triggering rate (FTR) compared to the inference-time collaboration baseline without training (Tables 3 and 4), and the FTR on AlpacaEval general prompts unrelated to safety is extremely low, only 6.7%. Even on benchmarks consisting only of challenging safety (WildJailbreak) and overrefusal (OR-Bench) prompts, the FTR is less than 50%, demonstrating that WaltzRL has manageable impact on latency even in the most extreme case. Since our approach is highly adaptable and that we allow maximum Tmax = 1 round of feedback in our experiments, the latency impact of WaltzRL is similar to safeguard models, which prior works consider acceptable for practical deployment (Sharma et al., 2025). Qualitative examples Qualitative examples (F) show that generated feedback successfully converts an overrefusal to compliance, and the conversation agent response follows outlines created by the feedback agent. Interestingly, we observe emergent behaviors where the feedback agent directly guides what the other agent should say, generating quote of an ideal response."

We consider three reward variants:\n(A): Rfeedback(fi) = αRDIR(fi)·Rlabel(fi) + λRlabel(fi) + γRformat(fi). Combination of all three rewards. This\nis the setup used in Stage 1 training.",
            "content": "(B): Rfeedback(fi) = αRDIR(fi)Rlabel(fi) + γRformat(fi). We disable the additive label reward term, but the Dynamic Improvement Reward is still conditioned on the multiplicative label reward. We use this in Stage 2 training. (C): Rfeedback(fi) = αRDIR(fi) + γRformat(fi). We disable the label reward completelyno explicit label reward and the Dynamic Improvement Reward is not conditioned on the label reward. 8 Figure 2 Left: Rate of conversation agent responses that improve under feedback in three setups (see (3.3). Middle: Rate of conversation agent response that has worsened under feedback. Right: Accuracy of feedback agent predicted (unsafe, overrefuse) labels. In Fig. 2, we investigate the balance of two objectives in feedback agent learning: (1) The usefulness of the generated feedback, measured with the rate of conversation agent responses that has improved (reward increased) or worsened (reward decreased) after incorporating feedback. (2) Learning to predict the correct labels, measured by label accuracy against ground truth Alignment Labels. We find that all three setups learn useful feedback and lead to more improved than worsened conversation responses, but setup (A) slightly underperforms (B) and (C). On the other hand, (A) is most effective at learning accurate labels, followed by (B), and then (C). Comparing between (B) and (C), we find that conditioning the Dynamic Improvement Reward on the label reward is crucial for maintaining high label accuracy during training. To take full advantage of different reward setups, we therefore conduct our two-stage training where stage 1 uses reward setup (A) to first learning to predict accurate labels, followed by stage 2 which uses setup (B) to further enhance feedback usefulness. Two-stage training dynamics Shown in Appendix Fig. 3, Stage 1 training (frozen conversation agent) allows the feedback agent to learn to generate responses in valid format and predict labels correctly. Stage 2 training  (Fig. 4)  successfully enhances the reward of both the initial conversation agent response and the final response revised with adaptive feedback. Even at the end of RL training, the final outcome reward is still notably higher than the reward of the initial conversation agent response. This illustrates that feedback can lead to additional gains on top of single-model RL. Ablation on two-stage training To show the effectiveness of our two-stage training recipe, we now ablate the Stage 2 collaborative training and compare the results before and after the ablation. Shown in Table 5, we find that forgoing the second stage training leads to significantly higher ASR and ORR with similar label accuracy and FTR. This indicates that our Stage 2 collaborative training enhances safety, reduce overrefusal, while maintaining label accuracy learned from the first stage. ASR ORR Label Acc.

            "content": "9 Safeguarding LLMs External safeguards have been developed as an added layer of safety complementing model safety alignment. Widely used safeguards include both classifier models and guardrail endpoints such as LlamaGuard (Inan et al., 2023; Meta Llama Team, 2025), the OpenAI moderation endpoint (Markov et al., 2023), and Constitutional Classifiers (Sharma et al., 2025) (Markov et al., 2023). Standalone safeguard models decouple safety from LLMs and enjoy better flexibility in case safety standards change. Our feedback agent follows similar philosophy and is also specialized model for safety. However, our method enables deeper collaboration between the feedback and conversation agent compared to traditional safeguards. Alternative guardrail paradigms, such as Self-Guard (Wang et al., 2024) and AutoDefense (Zeng et al., 2024), face the same challenge as safeguard models and can only enhance safety but do not reduce overrefusal. Deliberative alignment (Guan et al., 2025) teaches models to reason explicitly about interpretable safety specification before producing final response. Our work extends deliberation to multi-agent dialogue between conversation and feedback agents. Complementary to our work, recent line of work discusses training models to maximize helpfulness or constructiveness while staying safe (Zhang et al., 2025; Duan et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025). Self-play and multi-agent RL Closely related to our work, Liu et al. (2025) cast single model into attacker and defender roles and conducts zero-sum game to train both roles through RL. Zhou et al. (2025) trains LLM agents that interact with human collaborator over multiple turns. Zha et al. (2025) and Sareen et al. (2025) train LLM for both generator and verifier roles to enhance reasoning capabilities. Recent works have formulated alignment as two-player game but only explored zero-sum settings where higher reward of one agent leads to lower reward of the other one (Zheng et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2025). We differ from prior work in that: (1) We deploy both agents at inference time, whereas Liu et al. (2025); Zheng et al. (2024) only deploy the trained defender LLM. (2) Our positive-sum reward setting explicitly encourages collaboration between agents."

Compared to existing approaches that focus on\ndeveloping a zero-sum game to train multi-agents competitively, our setting is a positive-sum game (eqn. 1)\nwhere the conversation and feedback agent are rewarded by the same outcome, encouraging collaboration.\nIn this work, we conduct multi-agent RL to train a feedback agent adapted to a specific conversation agent.\nFuture work can consider training generalist feedback agents that work off-the-shelf with different conversation\nagents.",
            "content": "Ethical Considerations This work focuses on improving the safety alignment of large language models through multi-agent reinforcement learning. By reducing both unsafe generations and overrefusal behaviors, our framework seeks to mitigate risks of harmful content while preserving helpfulness on benign prompts. We emphasize that the WaltzRL method is developed strictly for research purposes. Any deployment of LLMs in downstream applications should be accompanied by careful red-teaming, monitoring, and additional guardrail measures when needed.

In the feedback agent system prompt  (Fig. 6)  , we describe the task of giving feedback and providing high-level summary of the safety guidelines. The system prompts of the two agents are set to description that defines the initial collaboration framework between the two agents.

We sample 5000 WildJailbreak prompts and 5000 OR-Bench prompts for stage 1 training and the rest is used for stage 2 training. B.2 Training Infrastructure and Hyperparameters Our implementation builds upon open-source RL frameworks OpenRLHF (Hu et al., 2025b) and MARTI1. We employ vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) to accelerate the collaborative rollout process. We use rollout and training batch size of 32. We set KL coefficient β = 0.01, DIR coefficient α = 0.65, label reward coefficient λ = 0.25 when not disabled, format reward coefficient γ = 0.1, clip ϵ = 0.2. We set learning rate to 5 107 for both agents. We set the max prompt length to 4096 and max generation learn to 512 (per turn) due to the multi-turn rollout nature of our approach."

            "content": "During WaltzRL training, we produce Alignment Labels J(p, ct) = (unsafe, overrefuse) for each revision of the conversation agent response during the feedback process as the basis for the reward signal. The alignment labels are derived from using WildGuard (Han et al., 2024) as an LLM judge. Given prompt and response ct, WildGuard serves as classifier and we utilize two true/false labels from its output: (1) response_harmfulness, true if the response ct is deemed containing harmful content by WildGuard. (2) response_refusal, true if the response ct is refusal to prompt p. Additionally, because we employ WildJailbreak and OR-Bench prompts mixture as the training prompts, we can derive the prompt harmfulness label directly from the prompt data source: we set an additional prompt_harmfulness label to true if is harmful prompt from WildJailbreak, false if is benign prompt from OR-Bench. Next, we convert the 3 raw labels into 2 alignment labels as follows: unsafe = response_harmfulness overrefuse = prompt_harmfulness response_refusal. That is, we consider the response is unsafe if the response_harmfulness label is true as flagged by WildGuard, and the response is overrefusing if the prompt is not harmful but response is refusal."

Instruction Following and General Helpfulness Evaluation We conduct evaluation on AlpacaEval 2.0 using the official implementation (https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval). We conduct evaluation on IFEval, GPQA, MMLU, and TruthfulQA using the lm-evaluation-harness framework (https://github.com/ EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). For each dataset, we use the default hyperparameter setting specified in https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks. We measure length-controlled win rate (LCWR) and win rate (WR) on AlpacaEval 2.0, four accuracy variants on IFEval: prompt-level strict (PS), instruction-level strict (IS), prompt-level loose (PL), instruction level loose (IL), and multiple choice accuracy on GPQA, MMLU, and TruthfulQA."

            "content": "While WaltzRL demonstrates strong improvements on adversarial safety and overrefusal benchmarks, our work has several limitations. First, our experiments are conducted on English datasets. Future work can further evaluate how WaltzRL performs on adversarial attacks in other languages, such as side-channel attack in low-resource languages (Shen et al., 2024). Second, we only experimented on maximum single round of feedback (Tmax = 1) due to computation resource constraints. Experimenting on more rounds of feedbacks might leads to further improvements. Finally, although WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses and overrefusals, it does not fully eliminate them, motivating further future research on this topic. 17 Figure 4 Stage 2 training dynamics.
