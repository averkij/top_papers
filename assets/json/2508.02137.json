While structure-based virtual screening promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact. We present AuroBind, scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data. AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from high-confidence complexes, and teacherstudent acceleration strategy to jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed models outperform stateof-the-art models on structural and functional benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large compound libraries. In prospective screen across ten diseaserelevant targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 769%, with top compounds reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of 1630%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate cancer models. AuroBind offers generalizable framework for structurefunction learning and highthroughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between structure prediction and therapeutic discovery. Main Text The human genome encodes approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes, many of which are implicated in disease. However, only about 34% of these genes currently have drug candidates available for therapeutic intervention1. While experimental high-throughput screening methods, including combinatorial libraries2, DNA-encoded libraries3-5 and mass spectrometry-based screening6,7, have enabled hit discovery in some cases, they remain laborintensive, costly, and difficult to direct toward specific binding pockets. Structure-guided virtual screening approaches offer scalable alternative8. Physics-based methods like Glide9 and AutoDock Vina10 have played key role in early hit discovery, but their performance declines for convex or highly polar binding sites, often yielding weak binders and failing on intractable targets. Moreover, their reliance on high-resolution bound (holo) structures and predefined binding sites limits applicability to cryptic pockets11. Deep learningbased predictors for proteinligand complex structures and fitness have recently emerged12-18, but the accuracy of such attempts remains mixed and often falls short of physics-based methods19. Importantly, their real-world utility in prospective virtual screening remains largely untested. These limitations underscore the need for more accurate, scalable computational frameworks that bridge structural modeling and therapeutic validation. Generative foundation models for biomolecular interactions, such as RoseTTAFold AllAtom20 and AlphaFold 321, offer new opportunities for structure-based drug discovery. These models encode deep structural and evolutionary priors but face two major limitations when applied to ligand discovery. First, these models lack fitness-aware training, making it difficult to distinguish true hits from decoys. Second, they require substantial inference time per sample, limiting their scalability to screen ultra-large chemical libraries. We reason that extending generative foundation models with functional awareness and scalable screening capabilities, while preserving their structural fidelity, would revolutionize molecular discovery landscape and enable more systematic exploration of druggable targets across the proteome. To bridge these gaps, we introduce AuroBind, generative framework that bridges structure prediction and binding fitness modeling for efficient virtual screening. AuroBind integrates three key elements: (i) preservation of AlphaFold 3-level structural accuracy through training on curated semi-synthetic dataset of 330k protein-ligand complexes, (ii) functional fitness alignment via fine-tuning on 1.27 million chemogenomic measurements across 1, diverse protein domain; and (iii) two-stage distillation pipeline that produces lightweight, ultra-fast screening module capable of navigating chemical libraries at scale. AuroBind achieves state-of-the-art performance across wide range of virtual screening and experimental benchmarks, outperforming both physics-based and deep learning models in structure prediction, enrichment, and computational efficiency. To validate AuroBind experimentally, we performed systematical virtual screening campaign to screen 30-million-chemical library against 10 diverse, challenging and therapeutically relevant protein targets, including receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators and understudied protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The whole virtual screening process can be finished within 24 hours on local HPC cluster equipped with two H800 GPUs for each target. Across these targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates ranging from 769%, with top hit compounds reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. More importantly, AuroBind demonstrated strong generalization to orphan GPCRs, identifying potent agonists and antagonists without requiring any known binders, co-crystal structures, or predefined binding pockets. These results establish AuroBind as scalable and effective platform for the on-demand discovery of high-fitness small molecules that functionally modulate diverse protein targets. Results AuroBind enables joint structurefitness learning and scalable screening AuroBind takes as input protein sequence and ligand SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system), and jointly predicts the 3D structure of the ligand-bound protein complex along with scalar fitness score reflecting binding potency. The model is designed to support atomic-resolution, high-throughput virtual screening across ultra-large chemical libraries. AuroBind builds on an architecture inspired by AlphaFold 3 but optimized for binding fitness prediction, leveraging two critical capabilities of structural foundation models: the ability to model precise protein-ligand physical interactions and the capacity to incorporate coevolutionary signals from multiple sequence alignments. The framework retains the general layout of AlphaFold 3 (Fig. 1a; Methods), with three key extensions: (1) chemogenomic embedding module and fitness prediction head for predicting both per-residue and global fitness scores; (2) self-distillation module that refines structural accuracy using high-confidence, high-fitness complexes; and (3) lightweight student model, AuroFast, that accelerates inference by orders of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy. Together, these elements allow AuroBind to predict both atomic-level binding poses and fitness in single forward pass, while efficiently scaling to millions-scale compound libraries (Fig. 1b). Training of AuroBind proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we focused on proteinligand structure prediction. We curated dataset of approximately 100,000 proteinligand complexes derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)22 for this initial supervised training. To further improve generalization and structural fidelity, we employed self-distillation strategy: the initially trained model generated predicted structures proteinligand structures on the BindingDB dataset, which contains nearly 500,000 complexes, after excluding pairs with high fitness and confidence, this filtering yielded 230,000 self-distilled proteinligand complexes for subsequent training (Supplementary Fig. 1; Methods). The second stage involves fine-tuning the structure model from stage one on large-scale dataset of approximately 1.27 million proteinligand chemogenomic pairs curated from ChEMBL23and PubChem24 following the data cleaning strategies by ExcapeDB25, (Methods). This dataset encompasses diverse range of protein targets, small molecules and their corresponding scalar-labeled binding fitness (pXC50 value). fitness prediction head was appended after Pairformer to estimate binding fitness from the learned proteinligand representations (Fig. 1c, SI Methods 1.2.1). Initially, the model was trained using mean squared error (MSE) objective to establish baseline fitness prediction capability, and once stabilized, we leveraged direct preference optimization (DPO)26 objective to further finetune the model (Methods). During DPO, structural confidence scores served as soft weights, encouraging the model to prioritize high-confidence structurefunction associations while mitigating noise from weak or ambiguous binding data (Methods). This strategy sharpens the models ability to distinguish between ligands with subtle differences in binding fitnessan essential capability for effective prioritization in large-scale virtual screening. To support ultra-high-throughput virtual screening, we distill lightweight student model, named AuroFast, from AuroBind via teacherstudent paradigm (Methods). AuroFast maintains the ability to predict both structural embedding and fitness, but operates at 100,000 faster inference speed, enabling the screening of 2030 million compounds per target within hours on standard GPU clusters. During inference, AuroBind follows hierarchical screening protocol: AuroFast is first used to screen the full chemical library and prioritize thousands of candidate compounds with high predicted fitness. This subset is then re-evaluated by AuroBind to generate full ligandprotein complex structures and refined fitness scores. After that we performed post-processing including drug-likeness filtering, structure evaluation and commercial availability screening, yield final compound set for prospective wet-lab validation (Fig. 1d; Methods). This twostage approach draws inspiration from classical docking pipelines, which use coarsegrained scoring function for initial triage, followed by higher-resolution rescoring to refine candidate selection27,28."

            "content": "An ideal method for virtual screening should enable i) accurately predicting binding fitness, ii) scaling efficiently to ultra-large chemical libraries, and iii) capturing atomic-level protein ligand structures. To this end, we sought to evaluate AuroBind across fitness ranking, screening efficiency, and structural accuracy, using wide range of computational benchmarks. We first benchmarked AuroBinds ability to prioritize compounds by binding fitness, critical step for experimental followup. On the DAVIS29 and BindingDB30 datasets, we compared against AlphaFold 310, Ridge regression, ConPLex17, MolTrans31, DeepConvDTI32, EnzPred CPI33 and GNN-CPI34. All models were evaluated under the same training split as defined in the ConPLex17 framework, which explicitly excludes any complexes shared between the training and test sets to prevent data leakage. While AlphaFold 3 does not directly model fitness, its structure confidence score can serve as weak proxy, achieving area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) scores of 0.08 (DAVIS) and 0.13 (BindingDB). AuroBind-ZS, zero-shot variant not fine-tuned on these datasets, improved performance to 0.22 and 0.24, respectively, the best model that did not train directly on these datasets. When fine-tuned (AuroBind-FT), the model achieved AUPR of 0.61 on DAVIS and 0.70 on BindingDB, representing significant improvements of 33.8% and 11.6% over the best supervised baseline (ConPLex) (Fig. 2a, b). In addition to predictive accuracy, AuroBind provides residue-level interpretability through spatial fitness mapping. In the proteinligand complex with PDB ID 7A1P, high-scoring regions align with hydrogen-bonding hotspots predicted by plip, suggesting the model can capture physicochemical determinants of molecular recognition (Fig. 2c). We further evaluated the performance of model on large-scale virtual screening. The distilled version AuroFast was evaluated in zero-shot setting on the largest virtual screening benchmark LIT-PCBA35, comprising over 2.6 million proteinligand complexes across 15 targets (see SI Methods 1.5). To avoid data leakage, we exclude all the complex present in LIT-PCBA from our training set for both AuroBind and AuroFast. This approach aligns with established zero-shot evaluation protocols, as demonstrated in recent studies36. Compared to deep learning-based ultra-fast screening methods (DrugCLIP37, GNINA38, Planet39, BigBind36, and DeepDTA40) and classical docking approaches (Glide-SP9 and Surflex41), AuroFast achieved an enrichment factor 1% score of 7.58, exceeding the top-performing baseline by 37.6% (Fig. 2d). Notably, AuroFast enables screening throughput of >100,000 faster than AlphaFold 3 and >25,000 faster than AutoDock Vina, making it feasible to prefilter tens of millions of compounds per target within hours on standard GPU hardware (Fig. 2e). We did not include generative structure predictors such as AlphaFold 3 due to their low computational efficiency when scaled to million-level compound libraries. We next assessed whether AuroBind maintains high-resolution structural prediction of proteinligand complexes after being fine-tuned for functional accuracy. To ensure fair evaluation, PoseBusters42 analysis was performed with training cut-off of September 2021 for AuroBind, excluding all PoseBusters structures from their training sets (see SI Methods 1.5). On the PoseBuster V1 and V2 benchmarks, AuroBind achieved success rates of 79.1% and 81.7%, outperforming AlphaFold 3 (78.0% and 81.0%) and Protenix43 by larger margins (6.0% and 6.8%, with McNemar p-value<0.004) (Fig. 2g, h). These results align with our expectations, as the AuroBind was self-distilled with supplementary high-quality structural data. Compared to classical docking tools like AutoDock Vina and GOLD, AuroBind improved structural accuracy by 26.827.9% (PoseBuster V1) and 22.123.6% (PoseBuster V2), particularly in flexible binding pockets. These global metrics were mirrored at the local level. As an example in the 7OFF complex, AuroBind accurately recovered key polar contacts observed in the crystal structure, including hydrogen bond network among GLU106, ASP141, and ARG139. In contrast, AlphaFold 3s predicted pose missed several critical interactions, reducing structural plausibility (Fig. 2f). Together, these results demonstrate that AuroBind achieves state-of-the-art performance across all virtual screening and structure prediction benchmarks, while no previously reported model consistently performs at top level across these tasks. Systematic virtual screening across diverse protein targets with unprecedented success rates To validate AuroBind experimentally, we conducted systematic wet-lab screening campaign across ten protein targets spanning range of structural classes and therapeutic areas. The selected targets include receptor tyrosine kinases (TrkB, HER3), serine kinases (GSK3α, GSK3β, CDK2), epigenetic regulators (HDAC3), and protein-coupled receptors (CCR4, mGluR5, GPR151, GPR160). Target selection was guided by combination of biological relevance, assay feasibility, and the desire to span gradient of virtual screening challenges (SI Methods 2.1). Specifically, we included well-characterized drug targets with established assays (e.g., kinases and HDACs) to benchmark AuroBind against prior methods, alongside more challenging GPCRs (CCR4 and mGluR5). After experimental validation on the first 8 targets was completed, two orphan GPCRs (GPR151 and GPR160) were selected to test the models ability to generalize to low-data, structurally intractable targets. While we did not anticipate that all targets would yield high-confidence hits, the observed success across diverse target classes demonstrate the generality and robustness of AuroBind. For each target, we applied hierarchical screening protocol (Fig.3a). In stage 1, AuroFast was used to perform rapid fitness-based pre-filtering across libraries exceeding 30 million purchasable compounds, sourced from the ZINC, commercial off-the-shelf drug library44 and MedChemExpress (MCE) libraries45. In stage 2, the 10,000 top-ranking molecules from the AuroFast were re-scored by AuroBind to obtain high-confidence ligandprotein complex structures and refined fitness scores. The top-ranked 500 compounds were then automatically filtered based on drug-likeness and predicted solubility to yield final selection. To ensure structural novelty, we removed compounds with high similarity (a cut off of Tanimoto similarity>0.6) to known actives for each target recorded in ChEMBL23. Notably, we performed minimal binding modebased filtering, as our screening protocol does not rely on predefined binding pockets though it supports binding site-based screening (see Methods). We prioritized approximately 50 compounds per target for experimental testing. Primary screening was performed at concentration of 10 μM in biological triplicates (n = 3 per compound) based on different biochemical and functional assays. Experimental validation was performed using biochemical or biophysical assays appropriate to each target class, including kinase activity inhibition, TR-FRET displacement, glosensor (cAMP inhibition) and BERT2 assays (SI Methods 2.4). Due to differences in compound availability and solubility, an average of 3050 compounds per target were ultimately validated. Across the ten targets, we observed experimental hit rates ranging from 7% (HDAC3) to 69% (GSK3α) at concentration of 10 μM (Fig.3b). Pertarget hit rates were >10% for 8 targets, >20% for 5 targets and >30% for 4 targets. Notably, for GPR151 and GPR160, AuroBind is able to identify both agonists and antagonists, despite the absence of previously reported active compounds or crystal structures and low homology (sequence identity<0.3) with any protein in the fitness training set. On GSK3α, HER3, CDK2 and mGluR5AuroBind achieved 49-fold, 69-fold, 324-fold and 1474-fold higher hit rates, respectively, compared to the previously reported results (Supplementary Table 4). These results show that AuroBind can reliably support large-scale virtual screening and identify active compounds across wide range of protein targets, including those that are poorly characterized. Scalable discovery of potent, diverse and unseen functional hits While high experimental hit rates reduce the cost and effort of identifying active compounds, downstream utility in drug discovery depends critically on three additional metrics: binding fitness, chemical diversity, and molecular novelty. To evaluate binding fitness, we selected the top 35 most active compounds per target for doseresponse assays. AuroBind prioritized functionally active compounds with nanomolar to sub-nanomolar potency: IC50 values below 1 nM were observed for 2 targets, below 10 nM for 5 targets and below 1 µM for 8 targets (Fig.3b, 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3, 4). The strongest observed hit was TrkB-targeting compound with IC50 of 220 pM (Fig.3b). In total, three sub-nanomolar hits were identified, including two for TrkB and one for GSK3α. Compared to the best unoptimized hit compounds from prior screening methods, AuroBind yielded superior IC50 values across all tested targetsoutperforming by factors of 15.3 (mGluR5), 435 (HER3), 818 (TrkB) and 4185 (GSK3α) (Supplementary Table 4, Fig. 3). Even relative to previous hit compounds that were iteratively optimized in wet-lab cycles, AuroBind still produced better or comparable potency on CCR4 (6.78) and HDAC3 (286) (Supplementary Table 4, Optimized in wet-lab cycles). These results suggest that AuroBind can discover high-potency hit compounds for diverse targets after single virtual screening round of 3050 candidates, without the need for subsequent optimization. To better assess the correlation between predicted fitness and experimental fitness, we further evaluated the enrichment performance of AuroBind models using the enrichment factor at 1% (EF1%) under 10 μM inhibition threshold. For each target, we designated as negatives all ChEMBL compounds with reported activity > 20 µM and in-house experimentally tested molecules that demonstrated less than 50% inhibition, resulting in target-specific negative-topositive ratios that varied across the dataset (see SI Methods 1.5, Supplementary Table 3). We compared AuroBind, AuroFast, confidence scores from AlphaFold 3, as well as physicsbased docking baseline Vina. Hit identification was performed at two inhibition thresholds: >50% and >90% at 10 μM. Across all benchmarks, AuroBind significantly outperformed other approaches in EF1%, indicating superior ability to enrich true positives from large chemical libraries (Fig.4b). These results indicate that AuroBind is strongly competitive to deep-learning and physics-based screening methods in terms of hit enrichment. We also evaluated the chemical diversity and novelty of the identified hit compounds. To assess scaffold-level diversity, we randomly selected 10,000 cluster centers from 30 millioncompound chemical library and projected AuroBind-identified hits from each target onto this chemical space. In all cases, the hit compounds exhibited broad and evenly distributed coverage across diverse chemical scaffolds (Fig.4 c, 4d). To validate the chemical novelty of the screened compounds, we computed structural similarity to known active molecules from CHEMBL and observed gradient distribution (Fig.4 e), with 25% (71/283) compounds exhibiting Tanimoto similarity < 0.30 to any previously reported active compound. The gradient demonstrates the dual strengths of our model by showing its ability to uncover structurally diverse compounds for prospective discovery, and its capacity to retrieve molecules similar to known actives, confirming retrospective performance. This supports the conclusion that AuroBind discovers structurally diverse molecules beyond the reach of traditional methods. Remarkably, AuroBind also identified multiple potent hits for GPR160 and GPR151, which no active small molecules or structural templates had been previously reported. This demonstrates the models ability to generalize to targets that are both undrugged and structurally uncharacterized, setting where physics-based docking methods often fail due to the absence of reliable structural inputs. Targeting undruggable orphan GPCR with AuroBind Structural predictions from AlphaFoldDB46 suggest that GPR151 adopts relatively canonical GPCR conformation, whereas GPR160 deviates substantially, exhibiting atypical architecture and marked conformational flexibility, posing significant challenges for ligand docking (Supplementary Fig. 5). To evaluate the generalizability of AuroBind on previously intractable targets, we focused on GPR15147 and GPR16048, two orphan receptors lacking known ligands and experimentally determined structures, yet implicated in diseases such as neuropathic pain, diabetes, and cancer49-52. From the top-ranked predictions, we tested 50 commercially available compounds for functional validation using BRET253 and GloSensor assays54, respectively (see SI Methods 2.4.5, 2.4.6) as GPR151 and GPR160 primarily signal through the Gi/o pathway (GPR151 via Go, GPR160 via Gi)55. Remarkably, in the initial screening, 7 of 42 compounds targeting GPR151 showed either agonistic or antagonistic activity (Fig. 5a). Among them, GPR151C15 and GPR151-C40 elicited robust Go protein recruitment, with EC₅₀ values of 1100 nM and 4200 nM, respectively (Figs. 5b, c). Structural modeling confirmed that both ligands bind within the orthosteric pocket (Fig. 5d). Detailed analysis revealed that both compounds form extensive hydrophobic and polar interactions with GPR151, engaging the receptor Nterminus, transmembrane helices TM13, TM57, and extracellular loops ECL1 and ECL2 (Figs. 5d, e). Compared to GPR151-C40, GPR151-C15 forms additional contacts with residues V189ECL2, W2676.52, and I2887.35likely contributing to its greater potency and efficacy (Figs. 5e). In contrast, GPR160 displays markedly noncanonical conformation. Screening identified 14 out of 46 compounds with either agonistic or antagonistic activity (Fig. 5f). Notably, compounds GPR160-C45 and GPR160-C05 significantly activated GPR160, with EC₅₀ values of 1200 nM and 1250 nM, respectively (Figs. 5g, h). Interestingly, the two agonists appear to bind at distinct sites, underscoring AuroBinds strong potential in identifying diverse ligandable pockets (Figs. 5i). These contrasting models underscore the need for future high-resolution structural studies to clarify the ligand-binding mechanisms of GPR160. Together, these findings demonstrate that AuroBind achieves high hit rates and effectively identifies functionally active ligandseven for structurally atypical or previously uncharacterized orphan GPCRs like GPR160. In summary, AuroBind provides powerful approach for ligand discovery across broad spectrum of orphan GPCRs, including those traditionally considered undruggable. Discussion central challenge in structure-based drug discovery is to identify small molecules that modulate the biological function of underexplored protein targets. Our study demonstrates that functionally fine-tuning generative structural foundation models enables scalable and accurate virtual screening framework capable of retrieving diverse, potent functional hits across wide range of target classes. Specifically, AuroBind achieves this by shifting from purely geometric interaction modeling toward function-aware structure learning, capturing both physicochemical plausibility and functional relevance. AuroBind addresses long-standing limitations in traditional docking and deep learningbased pipelines, which often struggle with low hit rates, restricted generalizability, and limited scalability. In prospective evaluations across ten biologically and structurally diverse targets, AuroBind achieved hit rates ranging from 7% to 69%, substantially higher than typical docking pipelines. Several of the identified compounds demonstrated picomolar potency, and 25% of them showed low structural similarity to known actives, demonstrating the frameworks ability to explore sparsely sampled regions of chemical space and prioritize functional candidates. Importantly, AuroBind does not require experimentally resolved complex structures to succeed. For instance, despite the absence of structural templates and ligand data for GPR160, conformationally flexible orphan GPCR, AuroBind identified multiple potent hits, supporting the models robustness in structurally ambiguous settings. In contrast to prior models that rely on ligand similarity or rigid geometric fit, AuroBind is trained to infer functionally meaningful interactions from sequence and ligand structure alone. This inductive bias allows the model to generalize to previously unseen targets, including orphan receptors and poorly characterized enzymes. By integrating structural representation learning with chemogenomic fitness data, AuroBind moves beyond pose prediction to capture structurefunction relationships critical for drug discovery. Nonetheless, several limitations remain. First, the models performance on highly dynamic or disordered targets, such as KRAS or transcription factors like c-Myc, requires further evaluation. Second, while AuroBind demonstrates robust functional generalization, the accuracy of predicted fitness scores still leaves room for improvement, especially in sparsedata regimes where fine-grained distinctions may be subtle. Third, while the model can generalize in zero-shot settings, additional strategies may be needed to improve performance on extremely sparse protein families. It is worth noting that during the review process of this manuscript, several contemporaneous effortssuch as Boltz-256have been posted as preprints, similarly exploring the use of structural foundation models for fitness prediction. This parallel emergence underscores growing convergence in the field toward function-informed structural learning. What distinguishes our work, however, is threefold: (1) support for ultra-high-throughput virtual screening at scale, (2) the establishment of closed loop from in silico prediction to prospective experimental validation, and (3) the ability to discover hits for unseen, structureunknown targets. Through rigorous wet-lab validations across diverse targets, we demonstrate that AuroBind not only generalizes across protein families but also consistently identifies potent functional hits, thereby underscoring its practical utility in real-world drug discovery. Overall, our results highlight the potential of functionally fine-tuned structural foundation models to bridge the gap between geometry and biology. As generative modeling techniques and structural databases continue to evolve, frameworks like AuroBind may serve as foundation for autonomous, high-throughput, and function-informed drug discovery, bringing us closer to AI-driven platforms capable of end-to-end therapeutic design.

AuroBind takes protein sequences and ligand SMILES as input. It performs multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) search for the protein and generates ligand conformers. 48-block PairFormer captures joint proteinligand representations, which are passed to diffusion module to generate atomic-resolution complex structures. fitness module predicts the residue-level fitness map and global binding fitness score for each pair. AuroFast, distilled student model, enables ultra-fast screening by focusing solely on binding fitness prediction. b, Comparison to representative structure predictor, AlphaFold 3. While AlphaFold 3 can accurately predict proteinligand complex structures, it lacks mechanisms for fitness estimation and is computationally intensive for large-scale screening. AuroBind extends this capability by enabling structure-aware fitness prediction and scalable inference through AuroFast. c, Two-stage training strategy. The AuroBind fitness module is optimized in two stages: Stage involves supervised fine-tuning on 1.27 million chemogenomic datapoints; Stage II applies direct preference optimization (DPO) on confident structurefitness pairs, guiding the model to capture functional preferences conditioned on accurate binding geometries. d, High-throughput experimental validation. AuroFast screens millions of compounds across 10 targets. Top-ranked candidates are re-evaluated with full AuroBind predictions. Subsequent experimental screening and doseresponse assays confirm high hit rates, strong early enrichment, and sub-nanomolar leads across multiple protein classes. i e e o - t Deep learning Docking h n n r - t Predicted by AuroBind Ligand RMSD:0.61Å 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 2 5 , 0 0 0 Predicted by AlphaFold 3 Ligand RMSD:6.77Å Foundation model Docking Foundation model Docking Fig. 2 Computational performance of AuroBind across structure, fitness, and screening benchmarks. a,b, Performance of AuroBind and baseline models on the Davis and BindingDB datasets, measured by area under the precisionrecall curve (AUPR).

The dashed horizontal lines indicate the baseline (0% activation). i, Structural modeling of GPR160-C45 and GPR160-C05 within the GPR160 ligand-binding pocket reveals distinct binding modes for the two ligands. Methods Trainingdata Collection and Curation Structure prediction training began with 100,000 high-quality proteinligand complexes extracted from the PDB (release 30 September 2021, resolution 9 Å, 300 polymer chains). Complexes containing only ions, poorly resolved chains (< 4 residues or all UNK), unstable ligand fragments, or severe atomic clashes (> 30 % of atoms within 1.7 Å of another chain) were discarded, and assemblies with > 20 chains were trimmed to the 20 chains closest to randomly chosen interface token. After this initial supervision, the partially trained model was used to generate self-distilled data: it predicted structures for 500 000 BindingDB complexes with IC₅₀ 100 nM, and predictions satisfying ipTM > 0.8, ligand_pTM > 0.5 and pLDDT > 70, while sharing 60 % sequence identity with any PoseBuster target, were retained, yielding 230,000 additional complexes. Subsequent epochs were trained on balanced batches of 50,000 examples drawn equally from the original PDB and self-distilled sets. Concentration-response assays from ChEMBL23 (92,147 assays) and PubChem24 (58,235 assays) following ExCAPE-DB25 cleaning rules: active compounds with dose response 10 µM and both active and inactive screening records were kept, entries with low-confidence pXC50 = 3.101 or rarely observed molecules were removed, and proteins > 1,000 residues were excluded. Distribution-aware down-sampling yielded final set of 1,273,781 proteinligand pairs (1,376 targets, 492,447 unique compounds) with log-transformed activity values. final direct-preference-optimization pass, applied to pairs whose predicted complex confidence exceeded 0.5, sharpened the models ability to rank subtle fitness differences. Feature Construction All input complexes were preprocessed with streamlined workflow adapted from the AlphaFold 3(AF3) pipeline, with every DNA/RNAspecific step removed because AuroBind screens only proteinligand pairs. For each mmCIF entry we parsed atom coordinates and basic metadata (resolution, release date, experimental method, biological assembly, chemical components and chain information). Multiplesequence alignments (MSAs) for every protein chain were generated with ColabFold (MMseqs2 + HHblits). Tokens were then created at two granularities: one token per aminoacid residue (Cα as the center atom) and one token per ligand atom; modified residues are tokenized atomwise. Three complementary cropping strategies were applied before training. Contiguous cropping selects consecutive residues/atoms following AF3. Spatial cropping retains all tokens within fixed radius of randomly chosen reference atom. Spatialinterface cropping chooses the reference atom from an interchain interface ( 15 Å to another chains center atom) and again keeps nearby tokens; ligand atoms are always preserved. After cropping, pertoken features (indices, chain IDs, type masks), referenceconformer features (3D coordinates, element, charge, atomname encodings), MSAderived features (onehot sequence, deletion matrices, profiles) and an explicit tokenbond matrix are assembled (full list in Supplementary Table 1). To minimize redundancy, protein chains were clustered at 40 % sequence identity and ligands by exact Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD) identity; no additional interfacelevel clustering was required because the dataset contains only proteinsmallmolecule complexes. The resulting, deduplicated set constitutes the unified training corpus used throughout the structureprediction and fitnessoptimization phases described above. AuroBind Architecture AuroBind is structural prediction framework derived from AlphaFold 3 architecture and extended by direct preference optimization on large-scale chemogenomic databases. It enables both fitness prediction and atomic-level proteinligand structure modeling for accurate, high-throughput virtual screening (Fig. 1a). While retaining the core architecture of AlphaFold 3with its PairFormer and diffusion modules10AuroBind incorporates an additional fitness prediction module trained using direct preference optimization (DPO) on experimentally validated binding data48. This two-stage training strategy allows the model to generate high-quality proteinligand structures and simultaneously predict the fitness of these interactions, which is crucial for prioritizing candidates in virtual screening. Like AlphaFold 3, AuroBind accepts protein sequences and ligand SMILES as inputs. For proteins, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are first retrieved and processed; for ligands, 3D conformations are initialized with RDKit v.2023_03_3 using ETKDGv3. These inputs are then tokenized and embedded into unified token-level representations. standard protein residue is represented by single token, while modified residues and ligands are tokenized at the per-atom level. The PairFormer learns intraand inter-molecular interactions from these representations, capturing details at both the residue and atomic levels. The refined representations are then decoded into 3D coordinates via diffusion model. During this iterative denoising process, the model produces physically plausible structures along with confidence metrics such as predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT), predicted aligned error (PAE), and predicted distance error (PDE). AuroBinds fitness prediction module is trained to align predicted compound rankings with experimental binding affinities. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is used for training, with structural confidence scores serving as soft weights to guide optimization. This approach fine-tunes the model to differentiate between highand low-fitness ligands, an essential capability for efficient virtual screening and drug development. To further enhance efficiency in large-scale screening, we developed AuroFasta distilled version of AuroBind focused solely on fitness prediction. AuroFast is up to 100,000 faster in prediction latency compared to AlphaFold 3 or AuroBind, enabling rapid, structure-aware screening of millions of compounds that would be computationally prohibitive using the full model (see SI Methods 1). AuroBind Training AuroBinds training is performed in two main phases: structure prediction and fitness optimization, each executed in two stages. In the structure prediction phase, the model initially learns local structural features through 50,000 diffusion training steps and subsequently refines the proteinligand binding interface over an additional 20,000 diffusion training steps. During the first structure prediction stage, AuroBind was initially trained on approximately 100,000 proteinligand complexes curated from the PDB. Complexes with ion-only interfaces or low-quality contacts were filtered out. Following AlphaFold3s data processing protocols, we selected structures released before September 30, 2021, with reported resolution of 9 Å and containing 300 polymer chains. We also removed hydrogen atoms, chains with all unknown residues or less than 4 resolved residues, unstable ligand fragments (e.g., leaving groups), and chains with severe clashes (defined as >30% of atoms within 1.7 Å of atoms in another chain). For assemblies with more than 20 chains, we selected 20 chains based on their spatial proximity to randomly chosen interface token. In the second structure prediction stage, we employed self-distillation. After training on PDB49 complexes, AuroBind was used to predict proteinligand structures on the BindingDB dataset, which contains nearly 500,000 complexes, after excluding pairs with IC50 values below 100 nM. We then retained pairs with ipTM > 0.8, ligand_pTM > 0.5, and protein_pLDDT > 70, while removing those with homologs in the PoseBuster datasets exhibiting more than 60% sequence similarity. This filtering yielded approximately 230,000 self-distilled proteinligand complexes. In subsequent training, samples were drawn evenly from the original PDB dataset and the self-distilled set, with batch size of 192 for 20,000 steps. For fitness optimization, the first stage involved fine-tuning AuroBind on approximately 1.27 million proteinligand pairs collected from chemogenomic databases including ChEMBL23, PubChem24, and ExCAPE-DB25. Experimentally measured binding constants served as supervision labels during this stage. In the second fitness training stage, we fine-tuned the model on large and diverse set of proteinligand pairs with associated binding data, using direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the models ability to rank relative binding fitness. Overall training was conducted over 30 days using 96 NVIDIA H800 GPUs with Bfloat16 mixed-precision optimization, ensuring both efficiency and high model performance. Preference-Driven Fitness Prediction with AuroBind We implemented two-stage training for fitness prediction. Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT): fitness prediction head is applied to the PairFormer outputs, operating on multi-scale interaction matrices 𝐻!\"#$ ℝ%% capturing pairwise residue-ligand interactions and Dense scoring layers 𝑓\"(((𝐻!\"#$) = 𝑊)𝜎(𝑊*𝐻!\"#$ + 𝑏*) + 𝑏). Trained on 1.27 million protein-ligand complexes with experimental fitness measurements, we minimize: ℒ+,- = 1 𝐵 . / #/* (#) (#) 𝑦4$50 𝑦!$01 1 (#) 𝜎06! ) + 𝜆 6𝑦!$01 ), where the gradient penalty term enforces smooth fitness landscape. Stage 2: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): From Stage 1 predictions, we construct 0.2 million complex subset filtered by confidence (confidence score > 0.9). For each complex 𝑐7,we generate Predicted fitness ranking (7) ) and Experimental fitness ranking: 𝑅4$50 (7) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝑦!$01 𝑅!$01 (7) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝑦4$50 (7) ). And The loss implements Plackett-Luce ranking model, it retains the core philosophy of DPO optimizing model outputs to reflect experimentally derived compound rankings rather than absolute fitness values: ℒ89 = * . / 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃(𝑅4$50 (7) ) (7) 𝑅!$01 , . 7/* : 𝑃(𝑅4$50𝑅!$01) = ;/* (\"&) 06! (=!\"#$ (\")) ( )*& 06! (=!\"#$ /?) , /?) with 𝑟; denoting the 𝑘-th ranked compound in 𝑅4$50, and temperature 𝜏 = 0.1 controlling ranking sharpness. This preference-driven training encourages the model to prioritize rank consistency over absolute prediction error, improving its ability to distinguish compounds with subtle fitness differences. While our method remains fully differentiable and compatible with standard supervised pipelines, it aligns conceptually with the core goals of DPO and is particularly effective in structure-based screening applications where relative prioritization is essential."

            "title": "AuroFast Training",
            "content": "AuroFast is lightweight student model distilled from AuroBind for initial round highthroughput virtual screening. AuroBind takes the pair representations of protein-ligand complexes and predicts the fitness score without explicitly predicting the complex structures. For given protein target, compounds in the screening library are first clustered based on their ECFP4 fingerprints (radius = 2, 1024 bits). Within each cluster, centroid compound 𝑐AB5C40$ is selected based on maximum average Tanimoto similarity to other members (intracluster similarity > 0.6). During training, the structural embedding (referred to as the trunk embedding) of the corresponding 𝑐AB5C40$ protein complex, as predicted by AuroBind, is used as prior. AuroFast takes two types of input features: (1) Base features, including the compounds ECFP4 fingerprint and the proteins ESM-2 embedding; (2) Augmented features, comprising the structural embedding of the nearest centroid complex from AuroBind. The model is trained using multi-task loss to jointly approximate structural features and binding fitness: ℒ(\"C4 = 𝛼 𝐻!$01 𝐻D\"#E )+ 𝛽𝑦!$01 𝑦4$50, where 𝐻!$01 denotes the hidden representation of predicted trunk embedding, 𝐻D\"#E is the teacher models the hidden representation of trunk embedding, and 𝑦!$01 denotes the fitness estimate. At inference, novel compounds are encoded by retrieving their nearest 𝑐AB5C40$, the number of clusters is adaptively determined based on the dataset sizefor instance, one cluster center per 100,000 compounds, generating hybrid features through concatenation of ECFP4, ESM-2, and 𝑐AB5C40$s structural prior, and predicting fitness via lightweight Transformer. This architecture accelerates screening to 830 compounds/sec per H800 while maintaining comparable accuracy (Fig. 2d, Fig. 2e), as structural priors from 𝑐AB5C40$ embeddings enable local analogical reasoning without full complex prediction from AuroBind. The training protocol involved the same database as AuroBind, optimized over 24 hours on one H800 GPUs. Virtual Screening Pipeline To showcase the performance of our virtual-screening pipeline, we carried out large-scale screen against 30 million molecules sourced from the we conducted large-scale virtual screen targeting approximately 30 million molecules from sourced from the ZINC, commercial off-the-shelf drug library44 and MedChemExpres (MCE) libraries45, acknowledging that some overlap exists between these providers. The entire library was first evaluated with AuroFast with ten NVIDIA H800 GPUs; for each protein target this rapid single-pass predictor finished in 6 and returned the top-ranked 10,000 candidates (Supplementary Fig. 6). These 10,000 molecules were subsequently re-scored by AuroBind, which generates full proteinligand complex models and refined fitness scores (Supplementary Fig. 7); one run per target completed in 24 on single H800 GPU on average (runtime scales with protein length), and the 500 best-scoring compounds were forwarded to cheminformatic post-processing. Each of the 500 compounds was required to satisfy all of the following permissive property windows: molecular weight 200 Da, cLogP 6, hydrogen-bond donors 4, hydrogen-bond acceptors 10, and ESOL-predicted log 9; structures failing basic valence checks were discarded automatically. To ensure structural novelty, compounds with an ECFP4 (radius = 2) Tanimoto similarity > 0.60 to any reported active for the same target in ChEMBL were removed. As our workflow does not rely on predefined binding pockets, no additional posebased filters were imposed; instead, AuroBind-predicted complexes were inspected manually for plausible interactions, absence of severe clashes, and reasonable ligand strain. We selected 50 compounds per target for wet-lab validation, and due to differences in compound availability and solubility, an average of 3050 compounds per target were ultimately validated. Experimental-validation overview Each target-specific shortlist (3050 compounds) was screened at fixed concentration of 10 µM in biological triplicate (n = 3). For the ATP-competitive kinases GSK3α/β, CDK2, HER3 and TrkB, reactions were assembled in 384-well plates and read either with the ADP-Glo luminescent kit (Promega) or with LANCE/LanthaScreen TR-FRET tracer-displacement formats, exactly as described in Supplementary Methods 2.4. Recombinant CDK2 and bovine cyclin A2 were co-expressed in E. coli with yeast CAK, purified by Ni-affinity followed by size-exclusion chromatography, concentrated, aliquoted and stored at 80 C; the other kinase preparations and all tracer reagents were obtained commercially. Reaction progress was recorded on Synergy Neo, PHERAstar FSX or EnVision 2104 readers, and signals were normalised to vehicle controls containing 1 % (v/v) DMSO. Class-I HDAC3 activity was quantified in OptiPlate-384 wells with the fluorogenic AcLGK(Ac)-AMC substrate and trypsin developer; fluorescence (λ_ex 355 nm / λ_em 460 nm) was monitored continuously for 30 min at 25 C. GPCR signalling assays were performed on FLIPR Tetra high-throughput imager. CCR4 or HEK293-mGluR5 cells (20 000 cells well¹) were loaded with Fluo-4 or Fluo-8 calcium indicators, pre-incubated with test compounds for 1550 min, and stimulated with CCL17 or l-glutamate; peak fluorescence responses were referenced to highand low-control wells containing vehicle or known antagonist. GPR151 activation was tracked by BRET2 using an Rluc8/GFP2 G-protein biosensor, whereas GPR160 signalling was monitored with the GloSensor-22F cAMP reporter according to the manufacturers instructions. Compounds eliciting 50 % modulation relative to the appropriate control advanced to an 8 10-point, three-fold serial dilution series. Concentrationresponse data were fitted with four-parameter logistic model in GraphPad Prism or XLFit, yielding IC₅₀ values for confirmed hits. Catalog numbers, buffer compositions and detailed plate layouts for every assay are provided in Supplementary Methods 2."

            "content": "Supplementary Figures S1 to S8 Supplementary Tables 1 to 4 Supplementary Text Materials and Methods Supplementary Materials for Fitness aligned structural modeling enables scalable virtual screening with AuroBind 1. Training pipeline AuroBind follows similar data processing procedures as AlphaFold 3 (AF3) 21. Fitness screening for proteins and ligands eliminates the need for processing DNA/RNA data. Here we describe the standard operations for data preparation. 1.1.1 Overview AuroBind follows AF3 for parsing, cropping and featurization, with the DNA/RNAspecific components removed. Parsing: For mmCIF format inputs, we parse the atom sites and basic metadata including resolution, release data, method, bioassembly, chemical components, chain names, sequences and covalent bonds. MSA: multiplesequence alignments are generated by ColabFold (MMseqs2 + HHblits). Tokenization: For proteins and ligands are tokenized standard amino acid residues and atoms, respectively. For proteins, CF is defined as the token center atom for each amino acids. For ligands, the only atom of each token is the token center atom. Cropping: 1) Contiguous cropping. Contiguous sequences of polymer residues and ligand atoms are selected (AlphaFold-Multimer/AF3). 2) Spatial cropping. Polymer residues and ligand atoms are selected to those within close spatial distance of reference atom randomly selected from the center atoms. 3) Spatial interface cropping. The reference atom is replaced with interface atom which is randomly selected from the center atoms with distance under 15Å to another chains token center atom. Ligand atoms are ensured always retained. Featurization: 1) Token feature. The per-token feature includes position indexes, chain identifiers and masks. 2) Reference feature. Features are obtained from the reference conformation of specified residue or ligand. The generation of this conformer employs RDKit, utilizing an input CCD code or SMILES string. Missing coordinates are set to zeros. 3) MSA feature. Features derived from MSA, deletion matrix and profile. 4) Bond feature. Bond information including expected locations of polymer-ligand bonds, intra-/inter-ligand bonds, etc. Supplementary Table 1 Model Input Features List Feature Type Description residue_index Residue number in the tokens original input chain. token_index asym_id entity_id sym_id restype is_protein / rna / dna / ligand ref_pos ref_mask ref_atom_name_chars ref_space_uid ref_element ref_charge msa has_deletion deletion_value profile deletion_mean token_bonds Token number.

Computed before MSA processing. 2D matrix indicating if there is bond between any atom in token and token j, restricted to just polymer-ligand and ligand-ligand bonds and bonds less than 2.4 Å during training. Training Set Clustering To reduce bias in the training and evaluation sets, clustering was performed on protein chains and small-molecule ligands as follows: 1) Protein chains were clustered at 40% sequence identity. 2) Small molecules were clustered based on chemical component dictionary (CCD) identity, meaning only chemically identical molecules were grouped into the same cluster. No additional interface-based clustering was applied, as the dataset consists solely of protein small molecule complexes without other interface types. 1.1.2 Training data Structure prediction training data: During the first structure training stage, AuroBind was trained on nearly 100,000 protein ligand complexes curated from the PDB22. Complexes with ion-only interfaces or low-quality contacts were filtered out. Following AlphaFold3s data processing protocols, we selected structures released before September 30, 2021, with reported resolution of 9 Å, containing 300 polymer chains. We also removed hydrogen atoms, polymer chains with all unknown residues or less than 4 resolved residues, unstable ligand fragments (e.g., leaving groups), and chains with severe clashes (defined as >30% of atoms within 1.7 Å of atoms in another chain). For assemblies with more than 20 chains, we selected 20 chains based on their spatial proximity to randomly chosen interface token. In the second structure training stage, we employed self-distillation. Self-distilled prediction training data: After training on PDB complexes, AuroBind was used to predict proteinligand structures on the BindingDBdataset, which contains nearly 500,000 complexes, after excluding pairs with IC50 values below 100 nM. We then retained pairs with ipTM > 0.8, ligand_pTM > 0.5, and protein_pLDDT > 70, while removing those with homologs in the PoseBuster42 datasets exhibiting more than 60% sequence similarity. This filtering yielded 230,000 self-distilled proteinligand complexes, and in subsequent training, the training samples were evenly divided50,000 samples per epoch, with half coming from PDB data and half from the selfdistilled set. Fitness Finetuning data: We curated large-scale chemogenomic dataset, AuroDB, by integrating data from ChEMBL3023 and PubChem24, following the data cleaning strategy outlined in ExCAPEDB25. Specifically, 58,235 and 92,147 single-target concentration-response (CR) assays were selected from PubChem and ChEMBL, respectively. Active compounds with doseresponse values 10 μM were retained, while inactive compounds from CR assays and screening assays were included. The dataset originally comprised 72,161,011 structureactivity relationship (SAR) data points, each assigned log-transformed activity value (pXC50). To improve data quality, we removed compounds with infrequent appearances within the dataset and excluded all data points with pXC50 value of 3.101, which were expert-defined negative samples with low confidence. These steps resulted in more balanced and high-confidence dataset. The final benchmark dataset contained 3,636,740 chemogenomic data points, corresponding to 2,136,238 unique compounds. To further optimize computational efficiency, we excluded target proteins with sequence lengths exceeding 1000. Additionally, we applied downsampling based on the distribution of fitness values, resulting in refined dataset of 1,273,781 data points, covering 1376 target proteins and 492,447 unique compounds. This curated dataset was ultimately used for fine-tuning AuroBind. Experimentally measured binding constants served as supervision labels during this stage. In the second fitness training stage, we selected proteinligand pairs that exhibited predicted structure confidence scores greater than 0.5 and employed these for directed preference optimization (DPO) training. 1.2 Model Framework 1.2.1 Fitness head The structural models 48-layer PairFormer parameters are frozen and excluded from training. new 4-layer PairFormer module (with trainable parameters) is introduced to further process features output by the frozen model, producing single and pair features. Single features encompass all tokens, while pair features focus on protein-ligand and ligandspecific interactions, excluding protein-protein pair features. These features are fed into fitness prediction head (primarily an MLP structure) to predict fitness values for each residue (for proteins) or atom (for ligands). The total fitness per token is the sum of both contributions. To address the disparity in sequence lengths between proteins and ligands, the loss function weights are adjusted: the total weight for the small molecule part is set to twice that of the protein part. Within each modality, weights are equal across residues or atoms, and all weights are subsequently normalized. The overall fitness prediction is computed as the weighted sum of each tokens fitness value and its normalized weight. The algorithm process is as follows. 1.2.2 Confidence head The confidence head leverages the same PairFormer outputs as the fitness head, processed through additional MLP layers to generate these metrics. Training enables the model to predict several outputs, including three confidence metrics: the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT, measuring per-atom confidence), the predicted aligned error (PAE), and the predicted distance error (PDE). pLDDT. Predict LDDT that takes into account distances from all atoms to polymer residues. For ligand atom the confidence only takes into account interactions between the ligand atom and proteins. PAE. The estimate of the error of one token when aligned according to the frame of another helps determine confidence of interfaces or specific interactions between atoms. PDE. Predict the error in absolute distances between atoms."

First, we filtered the dataset by retaining only those proteins (UniProt ID) with at least 10 associated entries to ensure sufficient data for each group. Then, within each protein group, we discretized the continuous labels into bins using threshold of 0.15 to cluster similar values. For each bin, we randomly selected up to 5 entries to reduce over-representation of densely sampled regions while maintaining label diversity. To generate training batches, we implemented custom group-aware sampler, RandomGroupBatchSampler, which ensures that each mini-batch contains samples drawn from the same protein group. This sampling strategy ensures balanced representation across protein targets while preserving intra-group label diversity and reducing label redundancy. During the DPO training stage, we further prioritized sampling data with similar fitness values to enhance the models ability to distinguish subtle differences in binding affinities."

            "content": "We evaluated AuroBinds structure prediction capabilities using the PoseBuster benchmark datasets. PoseBuster V1 comprises 428 proteinligand complexes, while the more recent PoseBuster V2 contains 308 structurally diverse complexes released after 2021 and curated to remove any crystal contacts42. In keeping with AlphaFold 3s protocol21, we ensured zero overlap between the training and validation sets. Structural accuracy was assessed by pocket aligned rootmeansquare deviation (RMSD), with values below 2.0 Å indicating highquality pose predictions, and by PoseBusters physical plausibility suite, which checks chemical consistency, intra and intermolecular geometry, and hydrogen bonding fidelity. For fitness prediction, we benchmarked against the DAVIS29 and BindingDB30 datasets, which contain proteinligand pairs annotated with experimentally determined dissociation constants (Kd). The DAVIS dataset represents lowresource scenario with just 2,086 labeled examples, whereas BindingDB offers larger set of 12,668 examples. We split each dataset into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing, following the setting of ConPlex57. The definition of positive and negative samples also follows the criteria used in ConPLex. To mitigate class imbalance during model training, we upsampled the minority class in the training set so that positives and negatives were equally represented, while preserving the natural distribution in validation and test sets. Model performance was evaluated using both the area under the precisionrecall curve (AUPR) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROCAUC). To assess highthroughput virtual screening performance, we turned to the Lit-PCBA35 benchmark, curated collection of 149 PubChem bioassays covering 15 protein targets, each associated with experimentally validated actives (IC50 < 1 µM) and physicochemically matched decoys. In total, the benchmark comprises 7,844 actives and 407,381 decoysa 1:52 activetoinactive ratioand all targets have corresponding highresolution cocrystal structures. In pure zeroshot setting, we applied AuroFast to the full dataset for each target and reported early enrichment using the enrichment factor at 1% (EF1%), reflecting the models ability to prioritize true positives among the topranked compounds. To obtain experimentally confirmed inactive compounds, we queried ChEMBL for each target and retained all entries that satisfied either of the following criteria: (i) standard activity value (IC₅₀, Kᵢ, Kd, EC₅₀ or analogous) > 20 µM; or (ii) reported pChEMBL > 4 when the raw concentration value was unavailable.

Experimental Validation Protocols for Screening Targets 2.1 Target Description Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), serine/threonine kinase with two highly homologous mammalian isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β. It recognizes and phosphorylates substrates containing the conserved SXXXS(P) motif, targeting diverse cytoplasmic proteins and nuclear transcription factors. GSK-3 plays critical roles in regulating glycogen metabolism, insulin signaling, Wnt pathways and implicated in diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. To address the challenges of isoform redundancy and off-target effects, we designed isoformselective inhibitors to target the ATP-binding pockets of GSK-3α and GSK-3β58-61. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinase regulating G1/S phase transition in the cell cycle, driving the phosphorylation of the Rb protein by forming complexes with Cyclin E/A, thereby releasing E2F transcription factors to promote DNA replication and cell proliferation. It is aberrantly activated in various cancers. We designed highly selective inhibitors targeting its ATP-binding pocket, leveraging subtle structural distinctions between CDK2 and CDK4/6 in the ATP-binding site to minimize offtarget effects62,63. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), class protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) widely expressed in brain regions associated with cognition and emotion, is key modulator of excitatory neurotransmission and promising therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. mGluR5 mediates the Gqphospholipase pathway and is implicated in conditions such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and Fragile syndrome. We targeted the allosteric transmembrane domain of mGluR5 using selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), which bind wellcharacterized site distinct from the orthosteric glutamate-binding domain. Allosteric modulators, such as mavoglurant and MTEP, enable receptor subtype selectivity and show in vivo efficacy in preclinical models64-66. intracellular signaling via C-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4), seven-transmembrane GPCR for CCL17 and CCL22, is predominantly expressed on Th2 and Treg cells, and is implicated in allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, and various lymphomas. We targeted the intracellular C-terminal allosteric site of CCR4, which modulates ligand-specific activation and internalization67-70. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), class HDAC enzyme, plays critical roles in diverse physiological processes, including embryonic development, circadian rhythm, energy metabolism and immune modulation. Dysregulation of HDAC3 is implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases, making it promising therapeutic target. We designed selective inhibitors of HDAC3 by exploiting isoform-specific interactions within the active site71-74. Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase (HER3), member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases lacking intrinsic kinase activity, contribute to oncogenic signaling via ligand-induced heterodimerization with other HER family members, particularly HER2. HER3 is altered or aberrantly expressed across variety of tumor types and can be associated with poor clinical outcomes. Whereas anticancer agents targeting EGFR and HER2 have been approved for decades, no small molecule drug targeting HER3 has been approved. We targeted the ATPbinding site of HER375,76. BDNF/NT-3 growth factors receptor (Tropomyosin receptor kinase B, TrkB, NTRK2), encoded by NTRK2, is receptor tyrosine kinase activated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). Its dysregulation drives oncogenesis in cancers with NTRK2 fusions and is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.

Supplementary Results Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 1 Stage 2 Supplementary Fig. 1 Accuracy across training. a, Structure-prediction accuracy during two-stage training. Stage 1 (left of the dashed line) corresponds to optimization on experimentally determined proteinligand complexes, whereas Stage 2 fine-tunes the network on self-distilled corpus of high-confidence and high-fitness predictions. Running means (solid lines) and individual mini-batch scores (dots) are shown for overall LDDT (pink), protein LDDT (gold) and ligand LDDT (blue). b, Supervised optimization of the fitness. In Stage 1 the model is trained with meansquared-error (MSE) objective (red) while ranking loss (blue) is monitored but not optimized. In Stage 2 the MSE objective is replaced by directed preference optimization (DPO), producing transient spike in MSE that quickly subsides as both losses converge to lower values. Supplementary Fig. 2 AuroBind delivers more potent binders than previous virtualscreening workflows across eight therapeutic targets. Bars represent the lowest experimentally measured IC₅₀ (nM; lower values indicate higher fitness) obtained with AuroBind (purple) versus the best compounds reported by earlier in-silico campaigns (Others, grey). Across all targets, AuroBind matches or surpasses the fitness of both the leading unoptimized molecules and those improved through multiple rounds of wet-lab optimization. g d Supplementary Fig. 3 Inhibition distributions at 10 μM for all screened compounds across eight representative targets. Including receptor tyrosine kinases (HER3, TrkB), protein-coupled receptors (mGluR5, CCR4), serine/threonine kinases (CDK2, GSK-3α/β), and an epigenetic regulator (HDAC3). substantial proportion of compounds achieved >50% inhibition at the screening concentration, supporting subsequent hit validation and characterization. b GSK-3α C33 GSK-3β C04 d Supplementary Fig. 4 Doseresponse validation of selected hits across eight targets.

Supplementary Fig. 8 Influence of target protein confidence on affinity prediction accuracy. Stacked bar charts show the cumulative percentages of compoundtarget pairs whose absolute affinity error falls below increasing thresholds (dark to light shading) across different predicted confidence bins (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and >0.9) in the test set of BindingDB benchmark. When the predicted confidence is low (<0.6), affinity prediction errors are significantly amplified, indicating that poor global structure quality substantially impairs binding affinity prediction. As the predicted confidence improves beyond 0.8, the correlation between confidence and affinity error weakens, suggesting that once an overall reliable structure is achieved, other factors such as binding pocket modeling quality or the models perception of binding fitness become the dominant determinants of affinity prediction accuracy. Supplementary Table 4 Performance of AuroBind versus the best literature-reported virtual screening Method on specific target. For eight pharmaceutically relevant targets we compare our AuroBind (upper block) with the most successful virtual screening study reported for each target in the primary literature (middle block). For every target the first line gives the number of compounds that were experimentally confirmed as active (bold), the line in parentheses reports the total number of molecules taken forward to the assay (that is, the size of the prospective screen), and the third line lists the most potent biochemical affinity obtained in that campaign (IC₅₀). The bottom line indicates whether the primary hits were subjected to additional iterative wet-lab optimization cycles in the original study. AuroBind retrieves low-nanomolar to sub-nanomolar binders from prospective sets two to four orders of magnitude smaller than those used in previous work, yielding markedly higher hit rates while requiring no subsequent medicinal-chemistry optimization.
