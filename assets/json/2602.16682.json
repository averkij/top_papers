Introduction Human perception of space is inherently situated. As people move through the world, they do not perceive scenes from detached, global viewpoint; instead, they experience the environment relative to their own body and perspective. At any given moment, person maintains an implicit sense of their location, orientation, and the intentional arc of their movements (Merleau-Ponty et al., 2013). Collectively, these observer-centric capabilities constitute situated awareness (Flach, 1995, Tversky, 2009, Sarter and Woods, 1991, Endsley, 1995), which operates continuously during everyday interaction and forms foundational layer that supports more complex spatial intelligence. Situated awareness is not only central to human perception, but also critical for autonomous systems operating in physical environments. In robotics, knowing what an object is is insufficient; an agent must also track precisely where it is relative to its own body to effectively plan grasping and navigation. Similarly, in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), systems must continuously synchronize virtual content with the users physical perspective to maintain immersion. In both domains, failure in this translation decouples the systems understanding from physical reality. Cognitive science studies suggest that such spatial intelligence relies on path integration, where local, situated updates are accumulated to larger observer-aware map (McNaughton et al., 2006). Consequently, failures in situated awareness do not merely result in local errors; they create cascading drift that significantly degrades the systems capability to understand space and time (Wolbers and Hegarty, 2010). Yet, despite the importance of situate awareness, the current evaluation landscape has largely overlooked these observer-centric capabilities. While there is growing interest in spatial reasoning for MFMs, existing benchmarks, such as VSI-Bench (Yang et al., 2025b) and MindCube (Yin et al., 2025), predominantly focus on observer-independent tasks. These benchmarks emphasize object-object interaction, discrete mental simulation, and metric distance estimation skills that define spatial reasoning from detached, static, and third person perspective. As result, models are evaluated under the assumption that they are passive spectators rather than active embodied agents with their own view point, motion, and position. This leaves observer-centric situated awareness, the ability to understand space relative to the observer and how it evolves overtime, largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench, Situated Awareness in the Real World, novel video understanding benchmark designed to assess MFMs situated awareness capabilities. SAW-Bench comprises 2,071 carefully curated, human-annotated multiple-choice question-answer pairs spanning six distinct awareness tasks (localization, relative direction, route shape, reverse route plan, spatial memory, and spatial affordance), applied to 786 egocentric videos encompassing both indoor and outdoor environments (3.2). Videos in SAW-Bench are all self-recorded using Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses. The question-answer pairs are carefully designed to ensure that models need to reason about the observer itself and the environment, making situated awareness essential for solving our tasks (3.1). We conduct comprehensive evaluation of 16 open-source and 8 proprietary MFMs. The best performing model, Gemini 3 Flash, yields performance of 53.89% on SAW-Bench, significantly below that of humanlevel performance (91.55%). Beyond this overall performance gap, we identify four systematic patterns in model behavior (5): (1) models often conflate egocentric camera rotation with translational movement; (2) model accuracy degrades significant as trajectory complexity increases; (3) models exhibit mismatch between view-level internal memory and persistent world-state memory; and (4) environment openness alone is an insufficient proxy for spatial reasoning difficulty. Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Figure 2. Overview of SAW-Bench. We illustrate six representative tasks ( 3.1) evaluating different aspects of situated awareness: Self-Localization, Relative Direction, Route Shape, Reverse Route Plan, Spatial Memory, and Spatial Affordance. During data collection, human annotators follow pre-defined trajectories when recording egocentric videos ( 3.2); these trajectories are visualized as purple dashed arrows. For all tasks, the model input consists solely of egocentric video without access to any birds-eye or global scene representations; the visualizations shown here are provided for illustrative purposes only. 3 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Table 1.

Related Work General video understanding benchmarks. Video understanding has become central capability in MFMs, serving as key testbed for evaluating their ability to perceive, reason, and integrate visual and linguistic information over time. Recent benchmarks emphasize more complex forms of reasoning such as long-form video understanding (Chandrasegaran et al., 2024, Wu et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2025, Zhang et al., 2025a, Wang et al., 2025); visual-temporal reasoning (Liu et al., 2024, Shangguan et al., 2025, Xue et al., 2025); domain-specific reasoning (He et al., 2025, Zhao et al., 2025, Deng et al., 2025); and comprehensive video understanding (Ning et al., 2025, Li et al., 2024, Fu et al., 2025). Despite this growing complexity, these benchmarks remain largely allocentric, evaluating models as passive observers of scene-level events. Consequently, observer-centric spatial reasoning, understanding ones own position and relationship to the environment, remains largely unexamined, motivating the curation of SAW-Bench. 3D spatial intelligence. Research in 3D spatial intelligence has predominantly focused on reasoning over explicit, reconstructed geometric representations such as point clouds and meshes (Jain et al., 2022, Hsu et al., 2023, Huang et al., 2022, Abdelrahman et al., 2024). Early datasets like ReferIt3D (Achlioptas et al., 2020) and ScanRefer (Chen et al., 2020) evaluate the capability to ground natural language into specific 3D coordinates, while more recent datasets like 3D-VisTA (Ziyu et al., 2023), 3D-GRAND (Yang et al., 2025a), and EmbodiedScan (Wang et al., 2024a) assess more complex grounding and reasoning over holistic 3D scenes. Among these datasets, SQA3D (Ma et al., 2023) is the most relevant to our work, as it explicitly introduces situated questions in 3D scene (e.g., asking about the environment relative to specific location given 3D scene context). While prior work often relies on reconstructed 3D scenes, such data is costly to obtain and difficult to scale in real-world settings. In practice, self-recorded egocentric video is lower-friction input to MFMs, as it requires neither 3D capture nor externally mounted cameras. For that reason, SAW-Bench adopts egocentric video as its primary modality to evaluate situated awareness in realistic real-world settings. Visual-spatial intelligence benchmarks. In the visual domain, existing benchmarks often focus on highlevel semantic or commonsense reasoning, while overlooking fine-grained and precise spatial intelligence. 4 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Figure 3. Benchmark Curation Pipeline. We first pre-define 37 camera trajectories and annotate their metadata (details are provided in D). Human video collectors then record egocentric videos by following these trajectories in selected scenes. Low-quality recordings are filtered and re-captured to ensure consistent video quality. Evaluations that do focus on spatial awareness largely frame spatial reasoning through observer-independent tasks, overlooking the inherently observer-centric nature of embodied tasks. Benchmarks such as VSI-Bench (Yang et al., 2025b), VSI-Super (Yang et al., 2025c), SpatialBench (Xu et al., 2025), and SpaCE-10 (Gong et al., 2025) emphasize object-object interaction, counting, and distance estimation, which treat models as detached, external observer. Similarly, MindCube (Yin et al., 2025), MomaGraph (Ju et al., 2025) and All-Angles Bench (Yeh et al., 2026) assess spatial reasoning using discrete multi-view inference. While they evaluate models ability to integrate spatial information across viewpoints, they typically assume the observers state is given or static. As result, models capability for situated awareness, the continuous real time update from observers own pose and perspective relative to the environment, largely unexplored. more comprehensive comparison is provided in Table 1. 3. Situated Awareness Benchmark 3.1. Situated Awareness Tasks in SAW-Bench While cognitive science does not prescribe canonical task taxonomy for situated awareness, prior work across navigation (Tversky, 1993, Burgess, 2006), spatial updating (Franklin et al., 1992, Michon and Denis, 2001), spatial working memory (Luck and Vogel, 1997, Simons and Levin, 1997), and affordance (Gibson and Walk, 1960, Gibson, 2014) has studied these abilities as separable components, each capturing distinct aspect of how observers relates themselves to the environment. Motivated by this decomposition, we introduce six situated awareness tasks over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs derived from 786 videos, each of which requires models to understand and reason over the relationship between itself and the environment: Self-Localization (9.92%): infer the observers position within the environment from an egocentric viewpoint; Relative Direction (40.27%): reason about the observers relative position across time by relating starting and ending viewpoints; Route Shape (26.36%): characterize the geometric shape of the observers movement trajectory; Reverse Route Plan (11.06%): infer sequence of movements that returns the observer to the starting location; Spatial Memory (4.83%): reason about changes in the environment by comparing spatial information across time; Spatial Affordance (7.82%): determine whether specific action is feasible under physical constraints from the observers viewpoint. Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World 3.2. Video Collection Egocentric video is natural sensing modality for studying situated awareness, as it captures the environment from the observers own viewpoint and preserves the observer-centric structure of spatial perception during real-world interaction. Unlike third-person footage, egocentric video directly encodes where objects appear relative to the camera wearer, how the field of view evolves with head and body movement, and how visibility of the environment changes over time. To reflect this setting, all videos in SAW-Bench are recorded from an egocentric perspective using Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glass worn by human participants. Most videos are captured as single, continuous clips without interruption. For tasks involving Spatial Memory, we apply limited post-processing by concatenating two short clips recorded in the same physical scene: one before and one after controlled modification of the environment. No other temporal reordering or editing is performed. Audio is excluded from all videos to ensure that all reasoning is grounded solely in visual information. Our video collection process spans diverse set of real-world environments, including 10 outdoor scenes (e.g., courtyards, parking lots, lawns, and plazas) and 5 indoor scenes (e.g., lecture halls, classrooms, recreation rooms, and household environments). Within each scene, we collect approximately 40-60 distinct videos to support tasks that benefit from dense coverage of fixed environment, such as Self-Localization and Route Shape. For tasks that are more difficult to scale within limited set of scenes, particularly Spatial Memory and Spatial Affordance, we additionally collect set of videos across broader range of environments outside these core scenes. This supplemental collection prioritizes diversity over dense coverage, enabling evaluation of memory and action feasibility across varied layouts and physical constraints without requiring exhaustive sampling of each scene. During video collection, participants followed lightweight recording protocol, consisting of high-level guidelines intended to ensure consistency across scenes while preserving natural behavior. For tasks involving Self-Localization, participants were instructed to record videos from set of predefined reference locations (e.g., corners, side, or center) to ensure coverage of diverse viewpoints. Beyond these coverage requirements, the protocol did not prescribe specific paths, motions, or camera poses. Instead, participants were instructed to follow coarse trajectory shapes (e.g., zigzag or two consecutive turns), while retaining flexibility in how these shapes were executed within each environment. Recording protocols are provided in D.1. 3.3. Question-Answer Annotation and Quality Check Question-answer annotation. Question-answer (QA) pairs in SAW-Bench are annotated based on the predefined recording protocol and the known trajectory of each video. All QA pairs are annotated by the same human participants who recorded the videos, who followed predefined reference locations and coarse trajectory shapes during data collection. As result, annotation is restricted to these predefined configurations rather than open-ended interpretation of the video content. This design allows questions to target well-defined aspects of agent-centric situated awareness while minimizing ambiguity in ground-truth answers. Quality control. We perform quality check at both the video and annotation levels. For video quality control, each recorded video is manually reviewed by human reviewers. Videos exhibiting issues such as rapid head motion, poor visibility of key objects, or other factors that could impair spatial reasoning were discarded and re-filmed following the same recording protocol. To ensure high-quality QA annotation, each QA pair in the protocol is independently annotated by two annotators. We report inter-annotator agreement score in D.2. Disagreements were resolved through final review process following the same annotation guidelines. This 6 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Table 2. Evaluation Results on SAW-Bench.

Experiments 4.1. Evaluation Protocol Models. We evaluate diverse set of general-purpose MFMs in zero-shot setting. For open-source MFMs, we test: Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025b), Qwen3-VL (Bai et al., 2025a), InternVL 2 (Chen et al., 2024), InternVL 3 (Zhu et al., 2025), LLaVA-NeXT-Video (Zhang et al., 2025c), and LLaVA-OneVision (Li et al., 2025a). We also evaluate the following proprietary MFMs: GPT (Singh et al., 2026) and Gemini (Gemini Team, 2025, Comanici et al., 2025). We provide full model evaluation configuration in Table 4. Baselines. We include five baselines: (1) chance level (random), which is defined as the expected accuracy under uniform random answer selection; (2) chance level (frequent), which is defined as the accuracy achieved 7 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Figure 4. Error Case Analysis. (Left) Reverse Route Plan: Gemini 3 Flash successfully reconstructs the return path by systematically inverting the actions from the forward pass. In contrast, Qwen3-VL 235B attempts to exploit shortcut between the first and last frames, thereby neglecting the transitive dynamics and spatial transformations occurring throughout the frame sequence. (Right) Route Shape: While both Gemini 3 Flash and Qwen3-VL 235B effectively identify camera rotations, they falsely integrate these rotational pans into the observers physical movement trajectory, leading to incorrect shape understanding. by always selecting the most frequent answer; (3) blind LLM, which answer the multiple-choice questions without access to any visual information from the video. We use GPT-5.2 as our blind evaluation for this baseline. Details are provided in C.1; (4) socratic models (Zeng et al., 2023), which generate single holistic caption for each video using video captioner and use this caption as language-based representation of the video for downstream question answering. In evaluation, the model is provided with the question and the caption only. We use GPT-5.2 for both video captioning and question answering. Details are provided in C.2; (5) human level, which is measured based on the answers given by two graduate students, who have access to the full videos and no time constraints. Details are provided in C.3. Accuracy evaluation. We use accuracy as the primary metric to evaluate model performance on SAW-Bench. Following recent benchmarks for foundation model evaluation (Wang et al., 2024b, Shangguan et al., 2025, Zhao et al., 2025), we first apply regular-expressionbased parser to extract the predicted answer from each models raw response. If the parser fails, we additionally use GPT-4o-mini to extract the answer from the raw output. Prompt used for answer extraction is provided in B.3. 4.2. Main Results We provide quantitative results on SAW-Bench for all models in Table 2. To better understand where models fail, we select set of representative models (Gemini Team, 2025, Comanici et al., 2025, Singh et al., 2026, Bai et al., 2025a,b) and present examples of failure cases in G.1, G.2, G.3, G.4, G.5, and G.6. Widespread difficulty in situated awareness. Our evaluation reveals that situated awareness remains fundamental challenge for current MFMs. Even the top performing model, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 53.89% accuracy overall, leaving 37.66% performance gap compared to human accuracy of 91.55%. Notably, humans perform remarkably well on Self-Localization and Route Shape tasks, suggesting that 8 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World these categories are naturally intuitive to observers. Interestingly, the performance gap between human and top-performing MFMs is much smaller on Spatial Memory and Spatial Affordance, highlighting that current models may be relatively strong on tasks that rely more heavily on spatial memorization and depth cues. Proprietary vs. open-source model. In general, proprietary MFMs outperform open-source MFMs, with the largest performance gap appearing on Reverse Route Plan, task that requires sustained reasoning over egocentric trajectories and explicit tracking of intermediate movements. We provide qualitative analysis on model responses in Figure 4 Right. In these cases, open-source model tends to rely on shortcuts cues from some key frames, typically the first and the last frame of the video; whereas proprietary model more consistently maintain coherent observer-centric representation across the full extent of the video. Blind LLM vs. socratic model. The blind LLM achieves an overall accuracy of 31.34%, which is only marginally above chance level baselines, indicating that effective performance on SAW-Bench requires access to visual information. Compared to Blind LLM, Socratic model does not yield significant performance gains, achieving the same overall accuracy of 31.34%. Although Socratic model has indirect access to visual content through video captioning, reducing egocentric video into static language-based representation discards critical observer-centric cues such as viewpoint changes, orientation, and temporal structure. Notably, the Socratic model exhibits slightly better performance on Route Shape than the Blind LLM, suggesting that captions can convey coarse trajectory-level information. However, this limited improvement does not extend to other tasks. As result, high-level semantic summaries alone are insufficient to situated awareness. 5. Analysis To better understand when and why models fail at situated awareness, we analyze representative error patterns that reflect core components of observer-centric reasoning. Camera rotation as source of trajectory errors. We identify systematic failure mode in Route Shape occurring when changes in camera rotation are decoupled from the observers translational movement. To isolate this effect, we compare three controlled scenarios: (1) straight path with stable head orientation (Figure 5 Left); (2) the same straight path with frequent head rotations (Figure 5 Middle); and (3) true zigzag trajectory (Figure 5 Right). Despite identical translational motion in cases (1) and (2), even top-performing models frequently misclassify case (2) as zigzag trajectory: Gemini 3 Flash does so in 60.0% of instances, while Qwen3-VL 235B misclassifies 53.3% of cases. As illustrated in Figure 4 Right, models justify these predictions by erroneously attributing camera orientation shifts to physical body displacement. This failure highlights fundamental limitation in current MFMs: the inability to maintain robust observer-centric coordinate system that distinguishes egocentric rotational pans from global positional updates. Figure 5. Camera Rotation and Observers Trajectory. Visualization of three controlled scenarios used to isolate the impact of head rotation on Route Shape. (Left) straight path with steady head orientation; (Middle) the same straight path with frequent left-and-right head rotations; and (Right) true zigzag trajectory. 9 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Finding 1. Current MFMs often conflate egocentric camera rotation with translational movement. Table 3. Accuracy (%) on Relative Direction Tasks Stratified by the Number of Turns.

Spatial updating is an inherently accumulative process, where errors in estimating egocentric motion compound as the observer moves through an environment (McNaughton et al., 2006, Wolbers and Hegarty, 2010, Stangl et al., 2020). In human navigation, this integration is highly sensitive to noise introduced by changes in orientation (Cherep et al., 2020). To investigate whether MFMs exhibit similar sensitivity to trajectory complexity, we stratify results on the Relative Direction task by geometric complexity: (1) Straight (pure translation), (2) Single Turn (one rotational update), and (3) Two Turns (multiple rotational updates). As shown in Table 3, increasing geometric complexity is associated with substantial accuracy degradation for most models, particularly when trajectories involve multiple orientation changes. When quantified using relative performance drop with respective to straight trajectories, MFMs often exhibit significant degradation under multi-turn conditions, while human performance remains largely stable. This human-model gap suggests that current MFMs struggle to reliable integrate successive egocentric orientation changes over time, resulting in compounding errors as trajectories move away from simple translational motion. Finding 2. Model accuracy degrades significantly as trajectory complexity increases. Failure to maintain persistent object memory. recurring failure mode across Spatial Memory tasks arises from models difficulty in maintaining object persistence across egocentric motion. Although models often provide accurate descriptions of what is visible in individual frames or short temporal windows, they fail to reason about objects that leave the cameras field of view. As shown in Figure 6, models tend to infer that objects are absent in earlier frames simply because they are not visible, incorrectly treating first observation as object appearance rather than recognizing that the object may have existed outside the field of view. These errors suggest that current MFMs rely primarily on view-dependent evidence, rather than maintaining persistent world-state representation over time. Finding 3. Persistent tracking of objects across frames remains an open challenge across models. 10 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World Figure 7. Indoor vs. Outdoor Performance. Comparison of zero-shot accuracy across six situated awareness tasks for Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5.2, and Qwen3-VL 235B. Effect of openness on situated awareness. Figure 7 summarizes model performance across indoor and outdoor environments. Contrary to the intuition that larger and more dynamic outdoor environments may increase spatial reasoning difficulty, no consistent performance degradation is observed in outdoor scenes. Across the four selected models, outdoor performance is often comparable to, and in several cases higher than, indoor performance. On average, the indooroutdoor performance gap remains small. These results suggest that environment scale alone does not determine spatial reasoning difficulty. While outdoor scenes typically span larger spatial extents, they often contain fewer objects and exhibit less structural clutter than indoor environments, which may reduce relational ambiguity. As result, spatial reasoning difficulty is not monotonically correlated with scene size or openness. Instead, indoor environments can pose equally, if not more, complex spatial challenges due to higher object density and more intricate layout structures. Figure 6. Model Responses in Spatial Memory. Across multiple models, non-visibility is incorrectly treated as non-existence: objects that exit the cameras field of view are inferred to have disappeared or changed, revealing gap between what is seen and what exists. Finding 4. Environment openness alone is an insufficient proxy for spatial reasoning difficulty. 6. Conclusion Situated awareness underlies how humans continuously perceive, navigate, and act in the physical world, yet it remains insufficiently captured by existing multimodal evaluation frameworks. In this work, we introduce SAW-Bench to explicitly evaluate observer-centric situated spatial understanding in MFMs using egocentric videos. Through systematic evaluation of 24 models, we uncover fundamental gaps in current MFMs ability to reason about observer-centric tasks. Our analysis identifies key factors underlying these limitations, offering insights for advancing MFMs toward more robust situated spatial intelligence. We hope this work sheds light on the development of AI systems that move beyond passive observation toward physically grounded, observer-centric, and interactive world understanding. 11 Learning Situated Awareness in the Real World"

            "content": "This work introduces SAW-Bench, benchmark for evaluating observer-centric situated awareness in MFMs using egocentric videos. SAW-Bench provides diagnostic tool to measure spatial understanding capabilities that are currently underrepresented in existing evaluation frameworks. Potential impacts include improved reliability of AI systems deployed in robotics, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and assistive technologies, where understanding spatial relationships from embodied agents or human wearers perspective is critical for safe and effective operation. While our benchmark does not introduce direct pathways to harm, we acknowledge potential downstream misuse, as models that perform well on these tasks could be integrated into applications that may be deployed in harmful ways. We encourage future work to study and adopt responsible deployment practices for systems built on or evaluated with our benchmark."

Whenever possible, we use the official code provided by each model for video preprocessing. Proprietary models and Qwen-series models are evaluated via their official API services1. In the evaluation prompt ( B.2), models are instructed to return responses in JSON-like format that includes both the selected multiple-choice option and the corresponding reasoning trace, enabling structured analysis and automatic parsing. When standard regularexpressionbased parsing fails, we employ GPT-4o-mini to extract the multiple-choice answers; the extraction prompt is provided in B.3. For thinking-enabled models, the thinking_level parameter for Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Gemini 2.5 Flash is set to the default dynamic mode2, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning budget based on task complexity. For Gemini 3 Pro, thinking_level is set to low, as the dynamic setting consistently produces reasoning traces that exceed the output context window, leading to incomplete or null responses.

In the first stage, for video question-answering task, video captioning model converts the visual input into language-only caption. In the second stage, language model receives the generated caption together with the question and answer options, and performs reasoning entirely in the textual domain. Under this setting, the reasoning model does not access raw visual inputs; instead, all perceptual information is compressed through the caption. This framework evaluates how informative the visual input remains when mediated solely through textual descriptions. In our baseline evaluation, we use GPT-5.2 (Singh et al., 2026) for both video captioning and caption-based question answering. Videos are sampled at 2 fps, and the sampled frames are stitched into 4 4 image grids, with each grid containing 16 frames. For each video, multiple 4 4 grids are provided to the captioning model to generate textual description.

Screenshot of annotation interface is provided in Figure 9. Self-Localization. Ground-truth answers are deterministically defined by the filming location of the observer within the scene (i.e., corner, side, or center). Since observer positions are predefined during data collection, labels of Self-Localization do not require human annotation. Relative Direction. Ground-truth answers are annotated by human annotators based on the relative spatial relationship between the observers starting and ending viewpoints along the trajectory. Each question is independently annotated by two annotators, and inter-annotator agreement is reported to assess annotation consistency. We annotate only trajectory-level meta information; in this way, all videos that share the same trajectory share the same relative-direction labels. Inter-annotator agreement score is reported in Table 9. Any annotation disagreements are resolved through discussion at the end of the annotation process. Route Shape. Ground-truth answers are deterministically specified by the predefined movement trajectory (e.g., straight, L-shape, U-shape, circular). Similar to Self-Localization, these labels are directly derived from the filming protocol and do not depend on visual interpretation. Reverse Route Plan. Ground-truth answers for reverse route planning are defined analogously to Relative Direction, describing the sequence of actions required to return from the final viewpoint to the starting viewpoint. These answers are annotated by human annotators to account for egocentric action interpretation, following the same annotation protocol as relative direction. Similarly, we annotate only trajectory-level meta information. Inter-annotator agreement score is reported in Table 9. Any annotation disagreements are resolved through discussion at the end of the annotation process. Spatial Memory. Ground-truth answers are specified during the filming process by intentionally moving or displacing selected objects along the trajectory. Since object state changes are controlled and recorded at capture time, no additional human annotation is required. Spatial Affordance. Ground-truth answers are likewise determined during filming by designing queries whose feasibility is unambiguous given the scenes physical layout and constraint.

Each subplot reports accuracy as function of the number of input frames (8, 16, 32) for fixed reasoning type. Lines correspond to different open-source MFMs evaluated with varying temporal context lengths. Tasks that require longer-horizon spatial integration, such as Spatial Memory and Route Shape, generally benefit from increased temporal context, whereas short-horizon tasks (e.g., Self-Localization and Relative Direction exhibit earlier saturation and more limited improvements beyond 16 frames.

All other configurations are held constant, as detailed in Table 4. Overall, increasing the frame sampling rate does not substantially improve situated spatial reasoning. Notably, performance on Spatial Memory decreases at FPS = 3, potentially due to redundant or temporally condensed visual information, while Reverse Route Plan performs worst at FPS = 1, suggesting greater reliance on temporal visual context for this reasoning type.

Then, at approximately 00:22.500, the camera makes another right turn and moves forward towards building with bike racks (00:23.000 to 00:36.000). This sequence of two right turns connecting three straight segments forms U-shape. Gemini 3 Pro The cameras movement can be broken down into two main segments based on the visual evidence: 1. **First Segment (00:00.000 - 00:22.000):** The video starts with the camera moving forward along sidewalk next to parking lot. We see red car, white car, and FedEx truck. The camera continues straight, passing parked cars on the right (a red sedan, white sedan, grey SUV with roof box, another white sedan). The movement is generally linear along the edge of the parking lot. 2. **Second Segment (00:22.500 - 00:36.000):** Around frame 00:22.500, there is distinct change. The camera view pivots or turns significantly to the right. After this turn, the camera begins moving forward again in new direction, perpendicular to the original path. The camera now moves towards beige building with brown awnings, passing gold sedan parked on the left and bike rack on the right.

The movement consists of several distinct straight-line segments followed by sharp turns. For example, the camera moves forward, then turns left around 00:11.000, moves forward again, turns right around 00:16.000, moves forward, turns left around 00:21.000, moves forward, turns right around 00:26.000, and turns left again around 00:30.000.

Then, around 00:11.000, the camera turns left and begins to move forward along path. This forward movement continues until about 00:20.500. At this point, the camera stops moving forward and turns right (approx 90 degrees) to face different direction, looking towards building labeled Kerr Hall. Then, from 00:21.000 onwards, the camera moves forward again in this new direction. Finally, around 00:26.000, the camera turns left again (approx 90 degrees) and moves towards the building entrance.

Turn around (face the direction from which you came, towards the dining area). 2. Go straight (through the dining area). 3. Turn left (to enter the kitchen, as the kitchen is to the left of the dining area). 4. Go straight (through the kitchen). 5. Turn left (to reach the starting point near the stove). This path matches option A. Qwen3-VL 30B \"options\": \"thinking_trace\": To determine the path back to the starting point, we analyze the videos sequence: 1. The starting point (frame 0-1) is near kitchen cabinets. 2. The end of the video (frame 26-27) shows white door. 3. Tracing the movement: the journey from start to end involved moving through the kitchen, dining area, and toward the door. To reverse this, from the door: - Turn around (face away from the door, toward the dining area). - Go straight (toward the dining area). - Turn right (to navigate toward the kitchen). - Go straight (toward the kitchen). - Turn left (to align with the starting point near the initial kitchen cabinets). This matches option D. Qwen2.5-VL 72B \"options\": \"thinking_trace\": To return to the starting point from the viewpoint at the end of the video, need to retrace my steps.
