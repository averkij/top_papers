Adversarial Fine-Tuning and Reactivation of Unsafe Behaviors. Maliciously selected finetuning examples can rapidly jailbreak models safety guardrails. For instance, fine-tuning GPT3.5 Turbo on as few as ten adversarially poisoned prompts eliminated its refusal behavior entirely (Qi et al., 2023). Similar attacks have subverted in Figure 1: Layerwise distribution of alignment-critical (red) and task-specific (blue) updates in 30-layer LLM. Task-specific updates dominate mid-layers (L1220), while alignment-critical updates concentrate in deeper layers (L2530), reflecting structural phase transitions in LLMs (Zhao et al., 2024b; Jain et al., 2024). other modelsincluding LLaMA-2, Falcon, and Vicunaby training on just few hundred toxic examples (Yang and et al., 2023) and (Lermen et al., 2023). Even GPT-4s robust RLHF safeguards were disabled by few hundred machine-generated toxic prompts (Li et al., 2025). Benign Fine-Tuning and Silent Safety Degradation. Alignment erosion also occurs under nonadversarial, task-oriented fine-tuning. Training GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI, 2021) on standard instruction datasets (e.g., Alpaca or Dolly) led to measurable drop in refusal accuracyup to 30% degradation after only few thousand benign examples (Qi et al., 2023). Task-specific adaptation for translation or code generation further increased harmful compliance, with refusal rates falling by over 20% (Jan et al., 2025). Critically, overlap between fine-tuning and safety-alignment distributions accelerates this drift: when task data resembles alignment data, models overwrite fragile safety circuits more readily (Hsiung et al., 2024). Sequential Fine-Tuning and Alignment Forgetting. In continual adaptation pipelines, earlier safety fine-tuning is often undone by subsequent capability tuning. Studies of alignment forgetting show that downstream updates induce representational shifts that reactivate unsafe behaviors, even when no harmful examples are used (Huang et al., 2024) and (Li and Lee, 2024). These shifts manifest as hidden embedding drift: alignmentcritical latent vectors migrate under new task gradients, leading to silent safety lapses despite stable surface-level metrics."

We define alignment-critical parameters as those whose perturbation disproportionately alters models refusal response. Ignoring this sensitivity risks degrading alignment, even under benign updates. Recent mechanistic findings (Jain et al., 2024) show that safety fine-tuning (DPO) minimally modifies MLP weights to steer unsafe inputs into refusal directionoften aligned with the models null spacethus blocking harmful output. This appears as WST = WIT + , where WIT, yet exerts pivotal effect. The top singular vectors of lie near the null space of IT, leaving benign inputs largely unchanged while sharply transforming unsafe activations. This localized transformation builds robust refusal mechanismselective, minimal, and behaviorally inert for safe prompts. However, adversarial examples orthogonal to s span may evade detection, exposing vulnerabilities of linear defenses. To disentangle safety-relevant learning from task adaptation, we decompose the LoRA update = AB = WA + WT , = W0 + . Alignment-Critical Component (WA): Projected into sensitive subspace via PA(AB), this component is tightly regularized to preserve safety. Task-Specific Component (WT ): The residual update (I PA)(AB) captures task knowledge and remains flexible. This decomposition enables selective control: safety is protected via constrained updates to WA, while WT supports continual learning. Analogy: W0 is the blueprint, the renovationupdating without touching structural safety beams.

            "content": "ALIGNGUARD-LORA decomposes LoRA updates into alignment-critical and task-specific components, enabling targeted control over alignment preservation. It introduces three essential modules: Fisher-based regularization to constrain updates in alignment-sensitive directions, taskspecific regularization to stabilize new learning without disrupting safety, and collision-aware constraints to minimize interference between safety and task subspaces. Each is indispensable: omitting any leads to alignment degradation, instability, or forgetting. 4.1 Identifying the Alignment-Critical Component (WA) Using FIM To preserve alignment during fine-tuning, we must constrain updates in directions most sensitive to safety behavior. We identify these alignmentcritical directions using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which quantifies how sharply the loss reacts to perturbations in each parameter. Illustrative Example (FIM-based): Consider simplified two-dimensional parameter space where: Axis 1: Represents high-sensitivity direction critical for alignment. Axis 2: Represents low-sensitivity direction. Suppose the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for this space (cid:21) is: = (cid:20)9 0 the low-rank update be: 0 1 , with square root: 1 2 = (cid:20)3 0 (cid:21) 0 1 . Let = (cid:21) (cid:20)1 2 , 1 2 = (cid:21) (cid:20)31 2 , 1 2 = 92 1 + 2 2. The first coordinate (with cost factor 9) is highly sensitive from an alignment perspective. non-negligible 1 leads to steep penalty, discouraging updates in that direction and protecting alignment. Conversely, larger 2 updates contribute less to the penalty, allowing more flexibility for task-specific learning. This illustrates how FIM-based sensitivity guides safe fine-tuning by penalizing updates along alignment-critical directions. Step 1: Compute the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and Perform Eigen-Decomposition. To capture parameter sensitivity to task loss, we compute the empirical Fisher Information Matrix (FIM): = L(cid:105) (cid:104) , where is the task loss and its gradient. The FIM encodes second-order information about how loss responds to parameter changes. We then perform eigen-decomposition: = Λ , with = [u1, . . . , ud] as eigenvectors and Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λd) as eigenvalues. Each pair (ui, λi) defines sensitivity direction, where larger λi signals higher task relevance."

Projecting LoRA updates onto FIM eigenvectors, we observe that even small components along high-λi directions significantly degrade refusal accuracy, highlighting their importance. Motivated by this, we select the top-m sensitive directions (with largest eigenvalues) and define: Um = [ui1, . . . , uim], spanning the subspace of alignment-critical directions. The projection operator onto this subspace is: PA = UmU m. We extract the alignment-relevant component of the LoRA update = AB as: WA = PA(AB). This decomposition restricts updates along alignment-sensitive directions, while allowing the orthogonal component (I PA)(AB) to adapt for task learning. This enables principled trade-off between alignment safety and fine-tuning. The theoretical basis and implementation, referred to as Collision-Aware Regularization, are detailed in Appendix C. 4.2 Alignmentand Task-Specific Regularization To independently constrain updates in safetysensitive and task-adaptive directions, we introduce two orthogonal regularizerseach tailored to its subspace and grounded in information geometry and optimization theory.

On the GLUE benchmarka collection of nine diverse language understanding tasks ALIGNGUARD-LORA achieves performance on par with full-model fine-tuning. For example, the average GLUE score across functions (e.g., MNLI, QQP, SST-2) remains within few points of that obtained by full fine-tuning, indicating negligible loss in task efficacy. Similarly, on the more challenging SuperGLUE benchmark, which includes Boolean QA and MultiRC tasks, ALIGNGUARDLORAs accuracy and F1 scores are comparable to those achieved by standard LoRA fine-tuning and full-model updates. In the HELM suite, which evaluates multiple criteria beyond accuracy (including calibration, robustness, fairness, and bias), ALIGNGUARD-LORA consistently ranks among the top models, with overall scores closely matching those of thoroughly fine-tuned models. Beyond standard evaluations, we assess robustness on adversarially perturbed tasks. On AdvGLUE (Liu and et al., 2021)an adversarial variant of GLUE designed to stress-test model vulnerabilitiesALIGNGUARD-LORA outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning baselines. For example, on adversarial SST-2, ALIGNGUARD-LORA exhibits smaller robustness gap, and similar gains are seen on adversarial NLI (ANLI) (Nie et al., 2020), where it surpasses alternatives by several points. Full results are shown in Fig. 13 and detailed in Appendix G. 5.2 Alignment Retention We evaluate how well safety behaviors are preserved during task-specific adaptation using the DRIFTCHECK: Diagnosing Alignment Drifta diagnostic benchmark introduced in this work. DRIFTCHECK measures fine-tuning-induced alignment drift by probing the model with matched sets of safe, unsafe, and adversarial instructions before and after adaptation. It spans tasks from GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), HELM (Liang et al., 2022), and AdvGLUE (Liu and et al., 2021), and includes prompts targeting refusal behavior, toxicity generation, and robustness to safety erosion. We report two widely adopted metrics: Refusal Accuracythe percentage of unsafe prompts that are correctly refusedand Toxicity Probabilitythe likelihood that generated response is flagged by automated detectors (e.g., Detoxify (Hanu and AI, 2020), Perspective API (Jigsaw Team, 2020)). These metrics, applied over DriftCheck, capture both behavioral safety and degeneration risks post-fine-tuning (Xu and et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020a; Panda and et al., 2023). As shown in Figure 4, we compare four configurations: Aligned Llama 3 (the safetyaligned base), Standard LoRA (task-only finetuning), Full Fine-Tuning (unconstrained updates), and our proposed ALIGNGUARD-LORA. Standard LoRA and Full Fine-Tuning substantially degrade alignment: refusal accuracy drops across all DriftCheck segments, and toxicity probability rises, especially on adversarial subsets. This corroborates prior observations that even benign task adaptation can subvert alignment objectives (Qi et al., 2023; Yang and et al., 2023; Jan et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025).

LoRA updates are decomposed into alignment-critical and task-specific components, ensuring safety and adaptability. the pretraining distribution that degrades general knowledge. In parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, this forgetting is typically quantified by the increase in pretraining loss Lpt after fine-tuning. Empirical results from Bethune et al. (2022) suggest that forgetting follows power-law relationship for both the fine-tuning data volume Df and Dβ model size : Lpt = L0 α + E, where L0 pt is the original pretraining loss, Df is the number of unique fine-tuning tokens, is the number of model parameters, and A, α, β, are datasetand model-specific constants. This captures key trade-off: increasing Df amplifies forgetting (Dβ t), while larger models forget less due to α. pt + Standard LoRA ALIGNGUARD-LORA Lpt = L0 pt + Dβ α + LAG pt = pt + Dβ ((1 + Γ r)N )α + Table 2: Scaling laws for forgetting in standard LoRA and ALIGNGUARD-LORA. L0 pt is the pretraining loss, Df is the number of fine-tuning tokens, is model size, and A, α, β, are domain-specific constants. AlignGuard introduces an effective factor (1 + Γ r) that reduces forgetting. Dβ (2022) refines the forgetting law as Lpt = L0 The original formulation from Bethune et al. pt + ((1+B p)N)α + E, introducing and injection fraction to account for additional pretraining data. In our setting, is fixed and small ( 1%), making (1+B p) effectively constant; its influence can thus be absorbed into and E, preserving empirical fidelity while simplifying interpretation. We adopt this reduced form to analyze forgetting trends under standard LoRA and ALIGNGUARD-LORA. As shown in Table 2, the ALIGNGUARD variant incorporates an additional scaling factor (1 + Γr) in the denominator, attenuating loss amplification and Figure 3: Ablation Study of ALIGNGUARD-LORA Across NLP Tasks (Accuracy/F1).

Across DriftCheck, AlignGuard reduces alignment degradation by up to 50% compared to traditional finetuning strategiesconfirming that targeted regularization of alignment-critical directions can prevent safety erosion while enabling effective downstream learning.

Rather than treating forgetting as binary phenomenon, we quantify it continuously via increased pretraining loss (Lpt) observed after fine-tuning on various domains. This analysis reveals that ALIGNGUARD-LORA generalizes more robustly across token-limited domains, exhibiting slower forgetting rates (β), lower interference (A), and smoother loss transitions (lower E) compared to standard LoRA. These benefits extend across structured, unstructured, technical, and conversational data types, highlighting AlignGuards alignment-preserving properties in diverse real-world scenarios. Setup. We fine-tune fixed-size LLM (13B parameters) for each domain on progressively larger fractions of the available domain-specific dataset. These token budgets vary significantlyfrom as few as 2 million tokens for Enron Emails to over 100 million for OpenWebText2. After each finetuning run, we evaluate the models loss on heldout subset of the original pretraining distribution (Appendix C) to isolate the forgetting effect. This provides us with sequence of post-fine-tuning loss values, indexed by domain-specific data scale. pt +A Power-law fitting. To interpret forgetting trends quantitatively, we fit 4-parameter power-law scaling model to each domains loss curve: Lpt = Dβ L0 α +E. We fit this expression using leastsquares regression over the observed loss values for each domain, separately for Standard LoRA and ALIGNGUARD-LORA. Importantly, our approach does not assume that all domains contain 13B tokens; instead, we empirically vary Dft up to the maximum available per domain and project the loss behavior under fixed 13B model size. Visualizing forgetting behavior. The resulting fitted curves are visualized in Figure 10, showing post-finetuning pretraining loss as function of available tokens per domain. The x-axis reflects actual data availabilitye.g., 2M tokens for Enron, 8M for StackExchange, 80M for Arxivand no extrapolation is performed beyond that. These curves illustrate how forgetting scales with data volume within each domain, and how AlignGuard consistently dampens loss escalation compared to standard LoRA. complete mathematical derivation and supporting empirical analysis can be found in Appendix F. Coefficient interpretation and Table 6. Table 6 presents each domain and methods fitted values of α, β, A, E. In addition, we report the Mean Relative Error (MRE) between predicted and observed losses, which quantifies the stability and predictability of forgetting under each method. Lower MRE indicates better retention and more consistent loss behavior across data scales. ALIGNGUARD-LORA consistently reduces the magnitude and volatility of forgetting across all 12 domains. What we observe: Across all domains, ALIGNGUARD-LORA consistently reduces the fit error, indicating more controlled and generalizable forgetting profile. For example, on Arxiv, AlignGuard reduces the relative fit error from 0.48 to 0.31a 35% dropdespite only minor changes in the scaling exponents. Similar gains are observed on EuroParl, PubMed, and StackExchange. These reductions are driven primarily by smaller values of and E, suggesting that AlignGuard constrains updates to lower-loss, alignment-safe regions of parameter space. Interpretation: The fact that α and β remain similar across LoRA and AlignGuard confirms that the underlying scaling dynamics are preserved. Rather than distorting learning behavior, AlignGuard improves retention by filtering updates through regularized subspace. Conceptually, AlignGuard prevents task-specific learning from pushing too hard in alignment-sensitive directions, resulting in lower long-term loss amplification and reduced catastrophic forgetting."

These findings substantiated with detailed mathematical formulation and empirical validation support the theoretical claim that alignment-aware regularization in ALIGNGUARD-LORA effectively boosts the models capacity to retain prior knowledge, leading to as much as 50% reduction in forgetting, without compromising adaptation fidelity.

ALIGNGUARD-LORA is principled, modular framework for alignmentpreserving fine-tuning of LLMs. Motivated by growing evidence of post-alignment drifteven under seemingly benign updatesALIGNGUARDLORAapplies curvature-aware lens to finetuning: (i) isolating alignment-critical subspaces using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), (ii) disentangling task-specific and safety-preserving updates, and (iii) regulating their interference via Riemannian and geodesic constraints. Through comprehensive experimentsincluding diagnostic benchmarks like DRIFTCHECK, rigorous scalinglaw analysis, and real-world task evaluationswe demonstrate that ALIGNGUARD-LORA reduces alignment degradation by upto 50%, while maintaining or even enhancing task utility. Unlike approaches that suppress expressivity to enforce alignment, it achieves robustness through structural selectivity, not constraint-heavy suppression. Our contributions are not merely empirical, they are conceptual. We call for shift from heuristic safety patches to structurally grounded alignment preservationgeometry-aware, disentangled, and compatible with diverse model architectures and alignment pipelines. ALIGNGUARDLORA is not an alignment induction mechanism but post-alignment safeguard that integrates seamlessly with methods like RLHF, DPO, or supervised instruction tuning. As LLMs scale across multilingual, multitask, and mission-critical settings, safety guarantees must endure not just during alignment, but throughout continual evolution. ALIGNGUARD-LORA offers blueprint for this next phase where alignment is not retrofitted, but retained: mathematically, scalably, and reliably. Looking ahead, we envision extending ALIGNGUARD-LORAwith (iv) policy-aware alignment controllers, (v) continual learning protocols, and (vi) instruction-switchable trust regionspaving the way for LLMs that remember how to reason, and how to be safe."

As with any system-level contribution, it is crucial to go beyond performance metrics and consider the broader conceptual, methodological, and practical implications. This section critically examines the frameworks assumptions, empirical generalizations, architectural portability, and interpretive clarity. We surfaced open questions that may inspire future work in alignment robustness, continual learning, and structured adaptation. 7.1 Discussion shift Toward Structurally-Aware Fine-Tuning.

Prior approaches optimized task performance without In safeguarding alignment-critical circuits. contrast, AlignGuard embeds modular structure into the optimization trajectory: isolating and shielding fragile alignment subspaces while enabling flexible adaptation elsewhere. This formalization acknowledges the empirical truth that fine-tuning often degrades safetynot due to malicious data, but due to entangled parameter updates. learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017), information geometry (Amari, 1998), and modular representation learning (Liu et al., 2023c), our framework introduces new fine-tuning regime: structurally bounded, behaviorally grounded."

            "content": "Architectural Transferability: Open but Promising. Although ALIGNGUARD-LORA is instantiated on LLAMA 3 (7B), its design is architecture-agnostic in principle. The orthogonal decomposition of updates and Fisher-based projections rely only on weight perturbation geometry. That said, the degree of alignment drift may vary with architecture-specific priors (e.g., recurrence, cross-attention layout, routing in Mixtureof-Experts). Whether the decomposition into WA and WT generalizes across such architectures remains an open but testable hypothesisespecially relevant for safety-critical deployment in encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5), chat agents (e.g., Claude, Gemini), or MoE systems (e.g., Mixtral). Post-Alignment Guardrails: Beyond Reward Models. AlignGuard is not an alignment induction methodit is an alignment retention mechanism. This distinction matters. Many alignment pipelines (RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022a)) focus on instilling refusal behaviors. AlignGuard complements these by ensuring that once learned, such behaviors are not lost during subsequent fine-tuning. We envision its integration into alignment stacks as second-stage safeguard: apply reward-tuning first, then guard with Fisher geometry and disentangled updates. Beyond Alignment Induction: Preserving the Fragile. AlignGuard operates in postalignment regimeits goal is not to induce safety, but to retain it. This is conceptually complementary to RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), or constrained decoding (Liu et al., 2023a). One promising direction is to stack AlignGuard atop reward-based methods as secondstage safeguard that filters and stabilizes aligned weights during continual adaptation. This would form hybrid paradigm: first induce, then guard. On the Limits of Proxy-Based Safety Metrics. Despite promising results on DRIFTCHECK, RealToxicity, and ACCD, we caution that these remain behavioral proxies. Refusal accuracy, toxicity scores, and pass rates are shallow observablescoarse reflections of deeper latent safety representations. Misalignment can persist even when these scores are high, particularly in rhetorical manipulation, lexical masking, or contextsensitive deception. Future work may strengthen evaluation by incorporating: Causal tracing tools (Wang et al., 2024b), Counterfactual probing (Burns et al., 2022), G-Eval-style alignment attribution (Liu et al., 2023b), Multilingual refusal consistency tests (Zhou et al., 2023).

Although AlignGuard incurs overhead from FIM estimation, eigen-decomposition, and collision Table 3: Discussion At Glance: Summary of Structural Insights and Research Directions in ALIGNGUARDLORA. Each design decision within ALIGNGUARD-LORA reflects deeper theoretical motivation, empirical necessity, and future extensibility.

Penalizes overlap between WA and WT using Riemannian (local) and geodesic (global) collision energies. Architectural Generalization AlignGuard is built atop Llama 3 but is structurally independent of the architecture. Geometry defines criticality, not model design. Behavioral vs. Causal Evaluation Metrics like refusal rate, toxicity, or detox accuracy reflect observable drift but not internal causal shifts. Hyperparameter pendence InterdeEffectiveness hinges on regularization strength (λA, λT ), projection rank (m), and collision blend (α). SafetyUtility Entanglement Task performance and safety behavior may be non-orthogonal in sensitive domains (e.g., legal, medical). Implication for Future Research Facilitates curvature-sensitive optimizers that adaptively suppress unsafe drift while encouraging safe generalization. Inspires new methods in second-order alignment-preserving learning. Enables disentangled adaptation with explicit control over behavioral safety circuits. Supports rollback, interpretability, and compositional fine-tuning. Can be layered atop any alignment induction pipeline, forming two-stage process: induce-then-guard. May become essential for continual or federated LLM deployment. Introduces novel class of latent disentanglement regularizers combining geometry and interference minimization. Opens pathways for safer multitask adaptation. Future work should validate portability to encoder-decoder models (T5), mixture-ofexperts (Mixtral), and RAG systems, especially for long-context and multi-hop QA. Calls for deeper evaluation via neuron attribution, causal tracing (Wang et al., 2024b), adversarial probing, and multilingual refusal symmetry (Zhou et al., 2023). Suggests the need for entropy-aware or trustregion adaptive scheduling. Meta-learned curvature-aware hyperparameter tuning is an open research avenue. Motivates soft projection alternatives (e.g., confidence-weighted updates, entropy-aware masking) to avoid underfitting or oversuppression in fragile domains. penalty computation, these costs are front-loaded and amortized over time. Once alignment-critical directions are identified and encoded into the projection PA, subsequent fine-tuning steps become safer and more stable. Nevertheless, for deployment on larger models (e.g., LLaMA 65B), approximate curvature estimation methodsdiagonal FIM, blockwise K-FAC (Grosse and Martens, 2016), or spectral sketchingmay be required to ensure feasibility. and Dynamic Hyperparameter Fragility Scheduling. The performance of AlignGuard is sensitive to regularization coefficients (λA, λT ), subspace size (m), and blending weight (α). These hyperparameters dictate the rigidity of safety enforcement vs. the flexibility of learning. While our ablations offer insight into stable configurations, promising future direction involves dynamic schedulingwhere the model adjusts regularization strength based on entropy, gradient variance, or curvature. Safety-Utility Entanglement in Real-World Domains. Perhaps the most subtle challenge is epistemic: safety and utility are not orthogonal in many real-world applications. For instance, legal assistant must balance lawful refusals with persuasive reasoning; medical assistant must flag uncertainty without suppressing helpfulness. In such domains, the hard partitioning of updates may cause underadaptation or misalignment. Future work could explore: Soft projections, Confidence-weighted decomposition, Table 4: Limitations: Operational Constraints and Open Technical Challenges.

            "content": "Architectural Scope and Evaluation Breadth. While AlignGuard is theoretically architectureagnostic, our evaluation is currently confined to LLAMA 3 (7B). This leaves questions about robustness across decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder models, sparse/expert-based routing (e.g., Mixtral), and multilingual settings. Expanding this evaluation to heterogeneous architectures would yield stronger external validity. Computational Cost of Fisher Geometry. Despite amortization, Fisher estimation and projection incur significant overhead, especially for large models. The naive application of full-rank FIM is infeasible for production-scale LLMs like LLaMA 65B or GPT-3.5. Future extensions could adopt low-rank sketches, diagonal approximations, or Kronecker factorizations (Grosse and Martens, 2016) to reduce cost without diluting sensitivity. Fragility of Hyperparameters. Regularization strength (lambdaA, lambdaT ), subspace dimensionality (m), and collision blending (alpha) jointly determine model behavior. Their interaction can be nonlinear and domain-sensitive. While our paper performs coarse-grained ablations, robust deployment will require domain-specific calibration or meta-learned schedules. Over-Regularization and Expressivity Loss. Strong suppression of alignment-relevant drift could constrain task-specific expression in safetycritical but utility-dependent domains (e.g., law, healthcare). Soft projection alternatives (e.g., entropy-weighted regularization or confidenceadaptive blending) may better balance robustness and nuance. Proxy Metrics and Behavioral Blind Spots. Safety proxies (refusal accuracy, toxicity drop) are coarse-grained. Subtle misalignmente.g., manipulative compliance, deceptive framing, or goal misgeneralizationmay evade detection. We advocate integrating alignment forensics tools (e.g., PatchLens (Wang et al., 2024b), G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023b), OR-Bench (Zhou et al., 2023)) for deeper tracing of latent failures. Update Decomposition Limitations. The = WA + WT decomposition assumes orthogonal functional entanglement between alignment and task paths. This is simplification. In cases where safety and task utility co-evolve, this separation may underperform. Layer-specific decompositions or confidence-weighted projections could mitigate this tension. Refusal Retention = Comprehensive Safety. AlignGuards alignment proxy centers around refusal behavior on unsafe prompts. However, comprehensive alignment involves grounded reasoning, factual calibration, epistemic humility, and value alignment. Future work may broaden safety signals beyond refusal and integrate symbolic reasoning scaffolds. These limitations point not to inherent flaws but to natural next steps in the evolution of structured fine-tuning. AlignGuard offers blueprintnot silver bulletfor alignment-preserving adaptation. Its components are grounded, extensible, and empirically validated; its open challenges provide fertile ground for future algorithmic, architectural, and diagnostic innovations."

            "title": "8 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",
            "content": "What is alignment drift and why is it important to quantify it during LoRA fine-tuning? Alignment drift refers to the phenomenon where fine-tuned large language model (LLM) gradually or abruptly loses behaviors that were instilled initially through alignment proceduressuch as refusal to answer harmful queries, sensitivity to bias, toxicity suppression, or adherence to ethical guidelineseven when the fine-tuning data itself is non-adversarial or task-oriented. This drift is not necessarily observable in surface-level accuracy metrics, making it insidious. Theoretical Framing. Let θ0 denote the pretrained, aligned parameters of an LLM, and θ = θ0 + θ denote the parameters after LoRA-based fine-tuning. Suppose alignment behavior is governed by submanifold Rd in parameter space, where deviations along certain sensitive directions ui Rd cause loss of safety behavior. Then the alignment-preservation condition can be formulated as: ui Tθ0(A) : ui, θ< ε, where Tθ0(A) is the tangent space at the aligned parameters, and ε is safety threshold. Alignment drift occurs when: ui Tθ0(A) : ui, θ ε. In standard LoRA, such directions are not explicitly identified or constrained, allowing low-rank updates θ = AB to overlap with alignment-critical subspaces due to latent entanglement (see (Elhage et al., 2022b)). Why Is This Dangerous? Recent work shows that even minimal task finetuning (e.g., summarization) can result in: failure to refuse harmful queries (e.g., jailbreaks), increased toxicity (RealToxicityPrompts), and loss of robustness to prompt rewordings (Qi et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024; Jan et al., 2025). These failures are not easily correctable post hoc. Huang et al. (2024) shows that alignment learned via supervised tuning (SFT) is particularly fragile. Quantification: Why and How? Alignment drift is difficult to detect using standard performance metrics (e.g., BLEU, accuracy). We introduce the DRIFTCHECK benchmark (see FAQ 4) to measure: Rsafe, Runsafe, T, representing changes in refusal rates on safe/unsafe prompts and toxicity scores. We define the Alignment Drift Score (ADS) as: ADS = Runsafe+γT , where γ balances semantic and lexical degradation. ALIGNGUARD-LORA explicitly minimizes this score through directional decomposition and regularization. Relation to Catastrophic Forgetting. Alignment drift is specialized form of catastrophic forgetting: Catastrophic Forgetting Behavioral Drift Alignment Drift Behavioral Drift. Because alignment-related behaviors are rare, safety-critical, and costly to recover, their degradation demands targeted mitigation. How does AlignGuard-LoRA differ from standard LoRA? Standard LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) introduces low-rank adapters into frozen LLM layers by reparameterizing weight updates as = AB, where Rdr, Rrk, and min(d, k). While computationally efficient, standard LoRA is agnostic to which parameters encode alignment behaviors and thus risks modifying safety-critical regions. (1) Structural Disentanglement: ALIGNGUARD-LORA decomposes the update into: = AB = PA(AB) (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) WA + (I PA)(AB) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) WT (cid:124) , where PA = UmU projects onto the top-m Fisher eigenvectors. Here: WA targets alignment-critical directions; WT captures task-specific knowledge orthogonal to WA. This separation is absent in standard LoRA, which treats all directions equally, making it vulnerable to alignment drift. (2) Fisher-Based Alignment Regularization: AlignGuard applies curvature-aware penalty: λAF 1/2WA2 , where is the empirical Fisher matrix: = ExD θL(x)θL(x)(cid:105) (cid:104) . This discourages updates in alignment-sensitive directions, which often encode refusal or moderation mechanisms (Truong et al., 2024). Standard LoRA lacks this sensitivity-aware constraint. (3) Task-Specific Stability Regularization: second penalty is added to avoid instability in WT : λT 1/2WT 2 , where may encode trust-region curvature or scaled identity. This aligns with Bayesian techniques like Laplace posteriors (Daxberger et al., 2021) and trust-region optimization (Zhang et al., 2022). (4) Collision-Aware Regularization: To enforce disjointness between WA and WT , AlignGuard introduces: (cid:104) λN αE(RM) col + (1 α)E(geo) col (cid:105) , where: E(RM) col E(geo) : penalizes overlapping coordinates using Riemannian weightings; col = WA,WT 2 WT 2 WA2 : penalizes angular similarity. This prevents destructive interferencean issue unaddressed in traditional LoRA. Similar methods are proposed in geodesic learning and contrastive representations (Lin et al., 2014; Gabrielsson and et al., 2023). (5) Empirical Behavior: On DRIFTCHECK, standard LoRA reduces unsafe refusal accuracy from 91% to 71.4%. ALIGNGUARD-LORA retains 92.3%, with <1% task performance drop on GLUE and HELM. It also improves forgetting scaling law fit: reducing amplitude and offset E, while preserving exponent behavior (α, β). Summary of Key Differences:"

            "content": "ALIGNGUARD-LORA Directional (WA, WT ) Fisher-weighted penalty Hessian/Trust-aware regularizer Riemannian + Geodesic Strong (up to 50% reduction) How is the alignment-critical subspace identified? The alignment-critical subspace refers to those parameter directions that are disproportionately responsible for preserving safety behaviorssuch as refusal, toxicity suppression, or bias avoidance. ALIGNGUARD-LORA identifies and isolates this subspace using Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)- based method rooted in information geometry and validated via empirical sensitivity tests. Conceptual Motivation. Let W0 Rdk denote the pretrained aligned weights of layer, and = AB be the low-rank update from LoRA. Not all directions in Rdk are equally importantupdates along certain subspaces may erase refusal behaviors. Denote the alignment-critical subspace by SA Rdk. Preserving alignment implies minimizing the projection of onto SA: PA(AB)2 should be small. To construct PA, we extract basis for SA via eigen-decomposition of the FIM. Step 1: Fisher Information Matrix. The FIM is defined as: := ExD θL(x) θL(x)(cid:105) (cid:104) , where θ is the flattened weight vector and L(x) is the task loss. We use blockwise approximation of , estimated via Monte Carlo minibatches (Daxberger et al., 2021; Kirsch et al., 2021b). Step 2: Eigen-Decomposition and Projection. Perform spectral decomposition: = ΛU = (cid:88) i=1 λiuiu , where λi is the sensitivity along ui. Define the projection operator: PA = UmU m, Um = [u1, . . . , um], choosing such that (cid:80)m i=1 λi/(cid:80)d j=1 λj η, e.g., η = 0.8. Step 3: Empirical Validation. We validate that top-λi directions are indeed alignment-relevant. For each ui, we project synthetic update onto it and measure refusal rate change on DRIFTCHECK: Ri = Refusal(ui) after Refusalbefore. High λi correlates with large Ri, confirming alignment fragility. Layer-Wise Projection. AlignGuard decomposes each = AB into: WA = PA(AB), WT = (I PA)(AB), penalizing 1/2WA2 while keeping WT flexible for task learning. Prior Inspiration. This method draws upon: Information geometry: FIM as Riemannian metric (Amari, 1998) EWC: FIM for continual learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) Laplace approximations: curvature-aware regularization (Daxberger et al., 2021) AlignGuard extends these to selective alignment preservation under low-rank adaptation. What is DriftCheck and how is it different from existing safety datasets? DRIFTCHECK is lightweight, diagnostic benchmark introduced in ALIGNGUARD-LORA to assess alignment degradation during LoRA-based fine-tuning quantitatively. Unlike existing safety datasets which measure static safety compliance, DRIFTCHECK evaluates alignment robustness under model updatesspecifically whether refusal behaviors persist after task adaptation. Motivation. Alignment is dynamic: model aligned at t0 may become misaligned at t1 following benign updates (Jan et al., 2025; Qi et al., 2024). We define drift as: Drift = A(Mpre) A(Mpost), where A() denotes alignment accuracy, such as refusal rate on unsafe prompts. Construction. DRIFTCHECK includes 10,000 single-turn prompts: 5,000 safe from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), covering factual, objective queries. 5,000 unsafe from HH-RLHF (Anthropic, 2022), OpenAI Moderation (OpenAI, 2021), and HateCheck (Rottger et al., 2021), spanning disinformation, hate speech, and harmful instruction. All prompts are stripped of special tokens to stress the models internal alignment rather than prompt engineering. Metrics. We compute: Rsafe, Runsafe, T, ADS = Rpre unsafe Rpost unsafe+γT pre post, where is toxicity, and γ = 0.5 balances behavioral vs lexical drift. Lower ADS indicates better alignment preservation. Comparison. Dataset HH-RLHF (Anthropic, 2022) RealToxicity (Gehman et al., 2020b) Detoxification (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) OR-Bench (Zhou et al., 2023) DRIFTCHECK (this work) Static/Dynamic Unsafe Diversity Drift Prior Use Refusal Eval Static Static Static Dynamic Dynamic Moderate High (lexical) Style-specific Low High No Yes No Yes New Partial No No Yes (narrow) Yes Empirical Utility. Standard LoRA reduces unsafe refusal from 91.3% to 71.4%. ALIGNGUARDLORA retains 92.3% under the same setup. DRIFTCHECK detects <5% drift even with Alpaca-style tuning, outperforming general benchmarks like GLUE or HELM. Research Use. DRIFTCHECK is ideal for studying: Safety retention under task fine-tuning Robustness across optimization methods (LoRA, DPO, RLHF) Fragility of refusal behavior in multitask settings It is open-source and reproducible with full metadata annotations. Why use the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for identifying and regularizing alignmentcritical directions? The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) provides geometry-aware sensitivity signal in parameter space, quantifying how small perturbations affect model output. ALIGNGUARD-LORA uses FIM to identify and penalize alignment-critical directions along which behavioral safety degrades most easily. 1. Definition and Interpretation. Let θ Rd be model parameters, and pθ(yx) the conditional output distribution. The FIM is defined as: (θ) = ExD,ypθ(yx) θ log pθ(yx)θ log pθ(yx)(cid:105) (cid:104) . Large eigenvalues indicate sensitive directions; i.e., where small updates cause large prediction shifts. 2. Quadratic Approximation of Alignment Loss. Expanding the loss L(θ) around aligned weights θ0: L(θ0 + θ) L(θ0) + θL(θ0)θ + Assuming θL(θ0) 0, we get: 1 2 θF θ. θF θ. 1 2 Hence, movement along high-Fisher directions induces higher alignment degradation. 3. Curvature-Aware Regularization. AlignGuard applies: λAF 1/2WA2 = λA Tr(W WA), where WA = PA(AB) is the alignment-critical projection. This suppresses drift in high-risk directions while preserving task-adaptive updates WT . 4. Empirical Fisher Approximation. True FIM is intractable. We use empirical Fisher: ExD[θL(x)θL(x)], as in EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), Laplace (Daxberger et al., 2021), and other continual learning techniques. 5. Layer-Wise Application. AlignGuard regularizes WA per-layer, aligning with LoRA blocks. Fisher curvature is estimated from mini-batch gradients, and task-safe updates WT = (IPA)(AB) are left unconstrained (except H-regularization). 6. Empirical Validation. Ablation studies show 17% increase in alignment drift when Fisher penalty is removed. Projection onto high-eigenvalue directions correlates with worst-case refusal degradation. Forgetting curves flatten under Fisher-aware adaptation. 7. Theoretical Basis and Related Work. Concept Curvature-aware safety Bayesian regularization Latent capacity preservation AlignGuard Realization 1/2WA2 KL penalty in FIM directions Fisher-guided directional suppression Prior Work Amari (1998), Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) Ritter et al. (2018), Daxberger et al. (2021) Liu et al. (2023), Ung et al. (2024) Why does AlignGuard-LoRA introduce collision-aware regularization, and how does it work? While decomposing the LoRA update into alignment-critical and task-specific components enables selective regularization, it does not guarantee that these components remain disentangled during optimization. If both updates modify overlapping coordinates or share directional similarity, interference may occurcausing either degradation of safety behaviors or suppression of task performance. This challenge motivates introducing of collision-aware regularization in ALIGNGUARD-LORA. 1. Theoretical Motivation: Interference in Overlapping Subspaces. Let = AB = WA + WT , where: WA = PA(AB), WT = (I PA)(AB). Even with orthogonal projection, nonlinear optimization can cause these components to converge in shared parameter regions, especially in high-curvature layers. Such convergence creates destructive interference: Interference Risk WA,ij WT,ij. (cid:88) i,j Thus, explicitly penalizing overlap becomes essential for robust adaptation. 2. Dual Penalty Formulation. ALIGNGUARD-LORA introduces blended regularizer: (cid:104) λN αE(RM) col + (1 α)E(geo) col (cid:105) , where: E(RM) col magnitude: : Riemannian Overlap, penalizing coordinate-wise collisions weighted by local update E(RM) col = (cid:88) i,j ηij(W ) WA,ij WT,ij, ηij = 1 + β σ(Wijτ ). E(geo) col : Geodesic Overlap, penalizing angular similarity between update directions: E(geo) col = WA, WT 2 WA2 WT 2 . The hyperparameter α [0, 1] controls the trade-off between local and global disjointness. 3. Intuition Behind the Metrics. Riemannian penalty enforces spatial disentanglementensuring large updates dont collide at the same indices. Geodesic penalty enforces directional separationensuring that gradient flow for safety and task updates remain uncorrelated. Together, they prevent update entanglement, critical failure mode in multi-objective fine-tuning. 4. Relation to Prior Work. While overlap penalties have been explored in contrastive learning and representation disentanglement (e.g., (Lin et al., 2014; Gabrielsson and et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2020)), their application to low-rank adaptation and alignment preservation is novel. Our formulation builds on: Smooth overlap suppression from Riemannian latent modeling, Geodesic divergence used in multi-modal disentanglement. 5. Empirical Impact. Ablation studies show that disabling collision-aware penalties increases DRIFTCHECK alignment drift by 14.8% and reduces task performance robustness across GLUE and HELM. The penalty proves critical when alignment and task objectives are competing, e.g., in summarization or code generation, where outputs closely mimic harmful inputs. Summary. Collision-aware regularization is not auxiliaryit is essential. It geometrically separates safety-critical updates from task-specific adaptation, enabling AlignGuard to balance robustness and plasticity without collapse. What are the Riemannian and Geodesic collision penalties, and why are both needed? ALIGNGUARD-LORA introduces dual collision-aware regularization scheme comprising Riemannian Overlap Penalty and Geodesic Overlap Penalty. These two serve complementary roles in ensuring that alignment-critical and task-specific update directions do not interfere in either coordinate space or angular geometry. Without both, models are prone to entangled gradients that degrade either safety or task utility. 1. Riemannian Overlap: Local Collision Suppression. This penalty enforces spatial sparsity by discouraging co-activation at the same parameter coordinates. Specifically: E(RM) col (WA, WT ) = (cid:88) i,j ηij(W ) WA,ij WT,ij, where the weight map ηij = 1 + β σ(Wijτ ) modulates the penalty more strongly in regions where the magnitude of parameter change is high. The sigmoid σ ensures differentiability, and the threshold τ identifies active regions. This structure draws from prior works in curvature-aware regularization and energy-based spatial disentanglement (Bergamin and Beerenwinkel, 2023; Truong et al., 2024). 2. Geodesic Overlap: Directional Orthogonality. This penalty ensures that the two update vectors inhabit distinct geometric subspaces. It is defined as: E(geo) col (WA, WT ) = cos2(θ) = WA, WT 2 WA2 WT 2 . This expression measures the squared cosine similarity between the flattened matrices, penalizing overlap in trajectory rather than location. Inspired by geodesic learning in graph embeddings and manifold-aware contrastive learning (Lin et al., 2014; Gabrielsson and et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024), it promotes rotational separation. 3. Why Both Are Necessary. Using only E(RM) addresses local index-wise clashes but may still col allow globally aligned updates that interfere behaviorally. Conversely, using only E(geo) permits local collisions, especially in high-magnitude regions, as long as overall directionality differs. The combined penalty: col λN (cid:104) αE(RM) col + (1 α)E(geo) col (cid:105) enables soft disjointness across both axes: spatial sparsity and angular separation. This blend ensures robust disentanglement across architectures and tasks. 4. Empirical Support. Ablation studies show that: Removing E(geo) Removing E(RM) col col average. leads to directional collapse, increasing alignment drift by 11. results in noisy task gradients, reducing GLUE performance by 2.1 points on Together, these penalties form principled disentanglement scaffold between safety and learning. 5. Broader Context. The principle behind this dual formulation parallels disentangled representation learning, multi-head orthogonality in transformers, and multi-task learning separation heuristics. But its targeted application to LoRA-style low-rank updates for safety-aligned LLMs is novel. Whats the motivation for the two regularization terms in AlignGuard-LoRA? ALIGNGUARD-LORA introduces two orthogonal regularization terms to constrain alignmentsensitive and task-adaptive directions separately: (i) Fisher-based regularization on the alignment-critical component WA, and (ii) task-specific stability regularization on the orthogonal component WT . These terms serve distinct but complementary purposes in preserving safety while enabling effective downstream learning. 1. Why Regularize Alignment-Critical Updates with Fisher? Safety behaviorssuch as refusal to harmful promptsare often encoded in fragile, low-curvature regions of parameter space. Movement along high-curvature directions can disproportionately degrade these behaviors (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Daxberger et al., 2021). Thus, we apply curvature-aware penalty: λA (cid:13) (cid:13)F 1/2WA (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) = λA Tr(W WA), where is the empirical Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). This formulation penalizes updates in directions with high Fisher eigenvaluesknown to be most sensitive to alignment degradation (see FAQ 5). Unlike naïve ℓ2 penalties, the Fisher-weighted variant aligns the regularization pressure with behavioral risk. This draws inspiration from Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), Bayesian Laplace approximations (Ritter et al., 2018; Daxberger et al., 2021), and curvaturepreserving continual learning (Liu et al., 2023c). 2. Why Regularize Task-Specific Updates Separately? While WT is not alignment-critical, it is susceptible to instability, overfitting, or catastrophic drift in low-data or multi-task regimes. To ensure stable learning, AlignGuard applies second penalty: λT (cid:13) (cid:13)H 1/2WT (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) , where is (possibly diagonal) second-order trust-region matrix, such as the diagonal Hessian, or scaled identity. This follows principles from stability-aware optimization, including trust-region adaptation (Zhang et al., 2022) and sharpness-aware training (Foret et al., 2021). This ensures that even task-directed updates remain controlled, smooth, and avoid creating optimization imbalance that could indirectly affect alignment. 3. Why Not Regularize Both with the Same Objective? Uniform penaltiessuch as global ℓ2 or FIM-aware regularizationfail to distinguish between the vastly different sensitivities of alignment-critical and task-general directions. By decoupling the penalties, AlignGuard can apply sharp, geometry-aligned suppression to safety directions and smoother adaptive damping to learning directions. This dual structure yields significant robustness without compromising flexibility. 4. Empirical Justification. Removing Fisher regularization increases DRIFTCHECK alignment drift by 17.2 Removing task-specific regularization increases variance across GLUE tasks and amplifies forgetting in long-sequence domains (e.g., PG19). Jointly applying both produces the flattest forgetting curves and most stable alignmentperformance tradeoffs. Conclusion. The motivation behind the two regularizers is architectural and functional: each targets distinct dimension of model behavior. This separation avoids over-regularization and enables AlignGuard to scale across both safety-sensitive and task-demanding domains. How does AlignGuard-LoRA perform compared to standard LoRA? ALIGNGUARD-LORA substantially outperforms standard LoRA in preserving alignment while maintaining or enhancing task performance. The empirical gap becomes especially pronounced when models are fine-tuned on instruction-like or domain-specific datasets that risk drifting from pre-established safety behaviors. 1. Safety Preservation on DRIFTCHECK. On the DRIFTCHECK benchmark (see FAQ 4), standard LoRA degrades unsafe refusal accuracy from 91.3% to 71.4% after fine-tuning on summarization. In contrast, ALIGNGUARD-LORA retains 92.3% accuracy under the same settinga 50% relative reduction in alignment drift. This preservation is achieved without any access to alignment supervision during downstream task training. Moreover, ALIGNGUARD-LORA stabilizes toxicity scores (RealToxicityPrompts) and reduces prompt-inversion vulnerabilities by 23.7% compared to standard LoRA. 2. Task Performance Across GLUE, SuperGLUE, and HELM. Despite stronger regularization, ALIGNGUARD-LORA preserves performance across diverse tasks: On GLUE, the average macro-F1 drop is < 0.4 points vs. standard LoRA. On HELM summarization, AlignGuard matches or slightly exceeds baseline ROUGE-L. On SuperGLUE, particularly Boolean QA and WSC, AlignGuard shows stronger stability with lower standard deviation. This suggests that alignment preservation does not conflict with generalizationespecially when regularization targets only sensitive subspaces. 3. Catastrophic Forgetting Scaling Law. AlignGuard also improves representational stability. When evaluated using the post-finetuning loss scaling law: Lpt = L0 + Dβ α + E, AlignGuard shows consistent reduction in forgetting amplitude and residual drift E, without modifying scaling exponents α, β. This indicates that AlignGuard preserves latent knowledge with negligible compromise on adaptation capacity (see Table 6). 4. Ablation Sensitivity. Removing individual components of AlignGuarde.g., Fisher regularization, collision-aware penalties, or task-stability constraintsleads to: 815% increase in DRIFTCHECK alignment drift, Up to 1.6pt drop in GLUE accuracy on CoLA and QQP, 23x variance in alignment behavior across seeds. These results reinforce the synergistic effect of the full AlignGuard stack. 5. Computational Efficiency. AlignGuards additional computationsFisher estimation and projectionare linear in rank and layer size. Total fine-tuning time increases by <15%, with inference unchanged. The framework is thus scalable to models up to 13B parameters with no architectural modifications. Summary. ALIGNGUARD-LORA significantly improves safety robustness while preserving or enhancing general task performance. It converts LoRA from purely adaptation-oriented method into an alignment-aware, safety-preserving fine-tuning frameworkenabling real-world deployment without post-hoc patching. What do the catastrophic forgetting scaling laws reveal about AlignGuard-LoRA? Catastrophic forgetting refers to models degradation of previously acquired capabilitiesespecially safety behaviorsafter fine-tuning on new tasks. ALIGNGUARD-LORA is explicitly designed to mitigate this phenomenon. To quantify this effect systematically, we derive and validate scaling law of forgetting, adapted from capacity analysis in continual learning and adaptation theory. 1. Formalization. Let Lpt denote the post-finetuning loss on the pretraining task. Then the forgetting behavior follows the empirical scaling law: Lpt = L0 + Dβ α + E, where: L0 is the pre-finetuning loss, Df is the number of fine-tuning tokens, is the model size, α, β: forgetting exponents (size and data sensitivity), A: forgetting amplitude, E: residual degradation shift. This formulation is inspired by earlier work in scaling laws for memorization and compression (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022b), and adapted for safety-aware forgetting in LLMs. 2. AlignGuard LoRAs Effect. Across 12 domains (e.g., PG19, PubMed, Enron, Github), ALIGNGUARD-LORA demonstrates: Reduced amplitude A: Forgetting magnitude drops by 2038% compared to standard LoRA. Stable exponents (α, β): Capacity efficiency and learning rate scaling remain intact. Lower residuals E: Final post-finetuning loss converges closer to L0, indicating safety retention. These results  (Table 6)  suggest that AlignGuard suppresses safety degradation without reducing model adaptability. 3. Mechanistic Explanation. The decomposition = WA + WT , paired with Fisher and collision-aware constraints, reduces learning along directions that overwrite alignment-critical knowledge. In contrast, standard LoRA updates (even if low-rank) do not differentiate safe from unsafe trajectoriesaccumulating interference and amplifying drift. 4. Predictive Utility. We show that the fitted parameters A, E, and residual RMSE can be used to predict alignment robustness even before evaluating on DRIFTCHECK. This introduces principled, unsupervised diagnostic for future alignment-aware tuning regimes. 5. Broader Implications. This scaling law bridges representation geometry (Fisher-aware drift) with practical safety diagnosticsextending beyond static refusal scores. It opens new avenues for theoretical study of alignment capacity in LLMs: how much safety knowledge can be preserved as model complexity or adaptation pressure grows. Is there trade-off between task generalization and alignment? The perceived tension between task generalization and alignment stems from the risk that preserving safety behaviors (e.g., refusals, toxicity suppression) may inhibit model flexibilityespecially when fine-tuning on expressive or open-ended tasks like summarization, dialog, or code generation. However, ALIGNGUARD-LORA demonstrates that this trade-off is not inherent but function of poor disentanglement in standard fine-tuning procedures. 1. Why the Trade-off Arises in Standard LoRA. In standard LoRA, updates = AB are applied uniformly across all subspaces of the parameter manifold. Since alignment-critical behaviors often occupy low-norm, high-curvature directions in the weight space (Liu et al., 2023c; Huang et al., 2024), task updates inadvertently perturb themeven if the task itself is benign. This creates measurable alignment drift (see FAQ 1). This entanglementbetween safety-relevant and task-general functionsis the source of the observed trade-off in prior studies (Qi et al., 2024; Jan et al., 2025). 2. How AlignGuard Resolves This. ALIGNGUARD-LORA structurally decouples these two directions by: Decomposing updates into WA (alignment) and WT (task), Penalizing curvature-sensitive updates with Fisher-based regularization, Stabilizing task-specific updates via soft constraints, Applying collision-aware penalties to prevent representational overlap. This architecture enables parallel optimization: alignment is preserved where the model is fragile, while task adaptation occurs where flexibility is safe. 3. Empirical Evidence: Joint Gains, Not Trade-offs. In extensive evaluations across GLUE, SuperGLUE, HELM, and DRIFTCHECK: AlignGuard reduces alignment drift by 4050% relative to LoRA, While improving or matching task accuracy in 87% of benchmark cases, And reducing cross-seed variance (stability) in over 90% of cases. In Table 6, we show that AlignGuard lowers forgetting amplitude without altering task scaling exponents α, βconfirming that alignment constraints do not compromise expressivity. 4. When Does the Trade-off Reappear? Residual trade-offs can occur in cases where: The task domain is inherently misaligned with prior safety behavior (e.g., adversarial or deceptive language), The safety behavior itself is over-regularized, limiting generalization (e.g., excessive refusal). In these cases, AlignGuards decomposition allows fine-grained tuning of alignment vs. task weights (e.g., via λA, λT )providing controllable levers rather than hard coupling. There is no fundamental trade-off between alignment and task generalizationonly an architectural one. ALIGNGUARD-LORA shows that with principled separation of concerns, models can be safe and innovative simultaneously. How is catastrophic forgetting modeled and mitigated in AlignGuard-LoRA? Catastrophic forgetting refers to the phenomenon where model, after being fine-tuned on new task, degrades its ability to perform prior functionsparticularly safety-critical behaviors like refusals or content moderation. ALIGNGUARD-LORA both models this phenomenon formally and introduces mechanisms to mitigate it actively during fine-tuning. 1. Modeling Forgetting via Scaling Laws. AlignGuard extends the capacity-based scaling framework introduced in (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022b) to quantify forgetting. Let Lpt denote the post-finetuning loss on pretraining-aligned behaviors, such as DRIFTCHECK refusals or toxicity control. The loss evolves with fine-tuning as: Lpt = L0 + Dβ α + E, where: Df is the number of fine-tuning tokens, is the model size, is the forgetting amplitude, is the residual loss shift (alignment collapse), (α, β) are the data/model sensitivity exponents. This parameterization allows AlignGuard to quantify how quickly and severely safety behavior deteriorates as adaptation increases. 2. Geometry of Forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting arises when fine-tuning gradients align with fragile subspaces encoding prior behaviors. Prior work in continual learning has shown that memory traces are encoded in specific curvature-rich regions of parameter space (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Ritter et al., 2018). Thus, updates in these directions disproportionately erase alignment knowledge. AlignGuard formalizes this by decomposing updates: = WA + WT = PA(AB) + (I PA)(AB), and applies Fisher-weighted regularization: λA (cid:13) (cid:13)F 1/2WA (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) , where is the empirical Fisher matrix and PA projects onto alignment-critical directions. This suppresses drift along the most curvature-sensitive axes. 3. Mitigation via Collision and Stability. Beyond Fisher-based protection, AlignGuard introduces two complementary terms: Task-Specific Regularization: Stabilizes WT to avoid destabilizing shifts in task embeddings. Collision-Aware Regularization: Prevents overlapping support between WA and WT via: Ecol = αE(RM) + (1 α)E(geo), where E(RM) penalizes coordinate-wise co-activation and E(geo) penalizes angular similarity (cosine squared). These three mechanismscurvature-aware suppression, disentangled adaptation, and geometric collision avoidancejointly form AlignGuards catastrophic forgetting shield. 4. Empirical Reduction in Forgetting. Across 12 domains  (Table 6)  : AlignGuard reduces amplitude by up to 38%, Lowers residual loss in safety evaluation tasks, Preserves alignment robustness under scaling, data variation, and multitask interference. ALIGNGUARD-LORA transforms catastrophic forgetting from an incidental failure mode into quantifiable, controllable processbridging continual learning theory and alignment safety practice in modern LLMs. What is the role of the decomposition = WA + WT ? The decomposition = WA +WT is the central architectural innovation of ALIGNGUARDLORA. It provides principled mechanism to disentangle parameter updates that preserve alignment (WA) from those that enable task adaptation (WT ). This separation is essential for maintaining safety behaviors while fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on new domains. 1. The Problem with Monolithic Updates. In standard LoRA, updates are applied as = AB, low-rank transformation applied uniformly across the models parameter space. This entanglement means that updates meant for task-specific adaptation can unintentionally overwrite alignment-critical parametersleading to alignment drift (Qi et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024). 2. Geometric Motivation. Suppose the pretrained weight matrix is W0 Rdk. Let the alignmentcritical subspace be spanned by eigenvectors Um Rdm derived from the Fisher Information Matrix . Then we define the projection operator: PA = UmU m, PA projects orthogonally. Now, given LoRA update = AB, we split it as: WA = PA(AB), WT = (I PA)(AB), such that: WA: resides in the high-curvature, alignment-sensitive directions (to be preserved), WT : lies in the task-adaptive directions (to be regularized but allowed to change). This formulation echoes subspace projections used in continual learning (e.g., EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)) and geometry-aware adaptation (e.g., Laplace Redux (Daxberger et al., 2021)). 3. Targeted Regularization and Control. Once decomposition is applied: WA is penalized via Fisher-based regularization: λA (cid:13) (cid:13)F 1/2WA (cid:13) restricting movement in sensitive alignment directions. WT is regularized via smoother stability constraint: (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13)H 1/2WT (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) λT , , where is task-specific trust-region or identity matrix. In addition, collision-aware penalties E(RM) rically distinct. and E(geo) col col ensure that WA and WT remain geomet4. Intuition and Analogy. Think of the weight matrix as building blueprint. Alignmentcritical regions (e.g., load-bearing walls) must not be altered. Task-specific areas (e.g., furniture) can be changed. The decomposition = WA + WT lets us renovate the model without compromising structural integrity. 5. Empirical Impact. Ablation studies in the paper show that removing the decomposition: Increases DRIFTCHECK drift by 22%, Lowers GLUE and HELM stability across seeds, Breaks the scaling law flattening observed with full AlignGuard. This confirms that the decomposition is not only theoretically elegant but practically indispensable. The decomposition = WA + WT is the key to achieving alignment-preserving fine-tuning: it isolates what should not be forgotten and enables what should be learned. It operationalizes safety as geometry. Why not use reinforcement learning (RLHF) for alignment instead? Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. It enables reward shaping based on implicit behavioral objectives (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness). However, despite its popularity, RLHF has several theoretical and practical limitations that ALIGNGUARD-LORA is designed to overcome, especially in the context of alignment preservation under continued fine-tuning. 1. Alignment Learning vs. Alignment Retention. RLHF is effective at learning new alignment policies, but brittle in retaining them during downstream adaptation. Since its gradients are typically sparse, trajectory-averaged, and entangled with preference modeling objectives, RLHF does not isolate alignment-critical subspaces. In contrast, ALIGNGUARD-LORA explicitly identifies these directions via Fisher sensitivity analysis (see FAQ 3), and applies targeted regularization to prevent drift. 2. RLHF and Fragile Equilibria. Recent work (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a) shows that RLHF solutions converge to narrow optima vulnerable to distributional shift, adversarial prompts, and instruction perturbations. These solutions are also sensitive to reward model overfitting and reinforcement destabilization. AlignGuard sidesteps this issue by preserving the structure of alignment-relevant geometry during task-specific updates, without introducing stochastic exploration or reward variance. 3. Empirical Fragility under Fine-Tuning. Empirical studies (Huang et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2024) show that even small amount of fine-tuning on task data causes RLHF-trained models (e.g., GPT-3.5, LLaMA 2-chat) to revert to unsafe completions. AlignGuard explicitly addresses this by anchoring the update path away from alignment-sensitive directions using low-rank projection WA = PA(AB). 4. Complexity, Instability, and Cost. RLHF training is resource-intensive, requiring: Training reward model (often with preference data), Reinforcement fine-tuning using PPO or similar methods, Repeated human calibration and safety testing. ALIGNGUARD-LORA requires no such reward infrastructure. It is drop-in fine-tuning scaffold compatible with existing LoRA workflows, requiring only Fisher and curvature estimates, with negligible compute overhead. 5. Philosophical Perspective: Interpretability vs. Instrumental Reward. RLHF produces alignment via behavioral incentivesmodels behave safely because they are rewarded for doing so. ALIGNGUARD-LORA, on the other hand, treats alignment as latent capacitypreserving mechanistically encoded safety behaviors that can be structurally interpreted, projected, and constrained. This aligns with interpretability-centric alignment agendas (Olsson et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Bender et al., 2021). RLHF excels at learning alignment from scratch, but fails to protect it once learned. ALIGNGUARDLORA complements this by offering an orthogonal solution: alignment preservation through geometry-aware fine-tuning. It is not competitor to RLHF, but missing safeguard in the modern alignment stack. How is the projection matrix PA chosen? The projection matrix PA plays central role in ALIGNGUARD-LORA by isolating the subspace of alignment-critical directions. It allows us to decompose low-rank updates = AB into two orthogonal components: WA = PA(AB) (alignment-sensitive) and WT = (I PA)(AB) (task-specific). The construction of PA must therefore identify directions that are both (i) high in curvature (sensitive to perturbation) and (ii) empirically associated with safety behavior. 1. Theoretical Basis. Let Rdd denote the empirical Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), defined as: := ExD θL(x)θL(x)(cid:105) (cid:104) , where L(x) is the loss on input x, and θ are flattened layer parameters. The FIM captures the local curvature of the loss landscape; directions with high eigenvalues λi correspond to directions where the model is susceptible to changes. We compute the eigen-decomposition: = ΛU = (cid:88) i=1 λiuiu , and define the projection matrix as: PA = UmU m, where Um = [u1, u2, . . . , um]. The top-m eigenvectors correspond to the most curvature-sensitive directions. 2. Criterion for Selecting m: Variance Thresholding. We retain enough directions such that the cumulative explained curvature satisfies: (cid:80)m (cid:80)d i=1 λi j=1 λj η, where η [0.7, 0.95] is tunable hyperparameter. In our experiments, η = 0.8 balances fidelity and sparsity. 3. Empirical Validation on DRIFTCHECK. To ensure that high-λi directions are truly alignmentrelevant, we validate as follows: Generate synthetic LoRA updates projected onto each eigenvector ui, Measure change in unsafe refusal rate on DRIFTCHECK after each projection, Observe strong correlation between λi and Ri, the drop in refusal. This empirically confirms that directions with large λi also correspond to fragile safety features. 4. Layer-wise Implementation. We apply this procedure independently per LoRA-injected layer: Compute local FIM using gradients for that layer, Perform eigen-decomposition and project updates accordingly, Store (ℓ) for each layer ℓ and apply in forward pass. This ensures sensitivity is measured with sufficient resolution and avoids over-constraining unrelated layers. 5. Analogy and Interpretation. Think of PA as safety spotlight illuminating only those directions in parameter space that encode fragile alignment behavior. All other directions are left free to support task-specific learning. This projection converts the inherently fuzzy protecting alignment goal into concrete, geometry-aware subspace operation. How costly is computing the Fisher matrix? Computing the full Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for large-scale models is prohibitively expensive. However, ALIGNGUARD-LORA circumvents this by using efficient layer-wise empirical Fisher approximations over minibatches, which incur negligible overhead relative to the overall fine-tuning costespecially in the context of LoRA. 1. Intractability of the Full Fisher. For model with parameters, the full FIM is symmetric positive semi-definite matrix: := ExD θL(x)θL(x)(cid:105) (cid:104) . For GPT-style models with 109, this would require storing 1018 entriesclearly intractable. 2. Layer-wise Block-Diagonal Approximation. Instead, AlignGuard applies Fisher decomposition per LoRA-injected layer: (ℓ) := ExD θ(ℓ)L(x)θ(ℓ)L(x)(cid:105) (cid:104) , where θ(ℓ) are the parameters of the ℓ-th layer. Since LoRA updates only affect small number of layers (e.g., attention and MLP blocks), the memory and compute scale linearly with the number of injected modules. In practice, each (ℓ) Rrr with = 64 or 128, which is easily storable and diagonalizable. 3. Mini-batch Monte Carlo Estimation. Rather than compute exact expectations, AlignGuard estimates (ℓ) using gradient outer products: (ℓ)"

The gradients are already computed during the forward-backward pass; no additional backward pass is required. 4. Runtime Overhead. The FIM computation is performed once at the beginning of fine-tuning (or cached from earlier runs), with cost: O(L r2 B), where is the number of LoRA layers. Compared to standard training complexity O(d ), this isnt very important. Empirically: For LLaMA 7B with 24 LoRA layers, total FIM time < 2 minutes, AlignGuard fine-tuning adds <3 5. Parallelization and Caching. Each layers Fisher estimate is computed independently, making the process embarrassingly parallel across GPUs or workers. Additionally: FIMs can be cached per model and reused across tasks. Spectral compression (e.g., top-20 eigenvectors) reduces cost without degrading performance. While naïve Fisher computation is infeasible, AlignGuards layer-wise empirical Fisher requires only lightweight minibatch gradient statistics. This makes it fully compatible with modern fine-tuning pipelines, delivering curvature-aware safety without sacrificing efficiency. Whats the theoretical justification for using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in scaling law analysis? The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) plays foundational role in characterizing how models forget prior capabilities as they are fine-tuned. In ALIGNGUARD-LORA, we exploit this link to derive and interpret scaling laws of catastrophic forgetting. The FIM connects local curvature, alignment sensitivity, and capacity constraints through well-established principles in statistical learning theory and information geometry. 1. Fisher as Local Curvature and Capacity Indicator. Formally, for model parameters θ Rd, and data distribution D, the FIM is: (θ) := Ex,yD (cid:104) θ log pθ(y x)θ log pθ(y x)(cid:105) . This encodes the local sensitivity of the output distribution to perturbations in θ. High eigenvalues indicate directions where small parameter updates result in sharp increases in loss or behavioral drift. In the context of scaling laws, directions with large Fisher eigenvalues represent low-capacity, high-risk regions. Intuitively, forgetting scales with the amount of parameter motion along these axes. 2. Second-Order Approximation and Loss Escalation. Consider the second-order Taylor expansion around aligned weights θ0: E[L(θ0 + θ)] L(θ0) + θF θ. 1 2 Thus, if updates θ align with top Fisher eigenvectors (as in standard LoRA), loss escalates rapidly. This aligns with the empirical scaling law: Lpt = L0 + Dβ α + E, where the amplitude captures the cumulative Fisher-weighted movement in alignment-critical directions. 3. Fisher and Intrinsic Dimensionality. Several works link the FIM spectrum to effective model capacity. The sharpness of the curvature spectrum constrains the models ability to learn new tasks without forgetting prior ones (Li et al., 2018; Fort et al., 2019; Evci et al., 2022). AlignGuard explicitly penalizes movement along these fragile directions to flatten forgetting curves. 4. AlignGuards Effect on Scaling Coefficients. By applying Fisher-aware penalties: λAF 1/2WA2 , AlignGuard reduces motion along high-curvature axesthereby decreasing the amplitude and residual drift in the forgetting law, without altering the exponents (α, β). This allows for safer scaling while preserving the functional form of learning dynamics. 5. Information Geometry View. From Amaris perspective (Amari, 1998), the FIM defines Riemannian metric over the space of distributions. Forgetting can be viewed as geodesic deviation from the aligned distribution. AlignGuard prevents this deviation by minimizing Fisher-weighted travel distance during fine-tuning. Using the FIM in scaling law analysis is not an empirical convenienceit is principled bridge between loss curvature, alignment sensitivity, and generalization dynamics. AlignGuard leverages this link to construct theory-grounded and geometry-aware forgetting control strategy. Could the method interfere with downstream tasks that share alignment features? This is critical and nuanced concern. In real-world applications, specific downstream taskssuch as medical question answering, legal summarization, or hate speech detectionnaturally share representational overlap with alignment objectives. For example, task-specific instruction like summarize ethically sensitive content may activate subspaces like those governing refusal behavior. The risk is that aggressive protection of alignment-critical directions might suppress valid task-specific updates. 1. Potential Interference: Directional Entanglement. If the downstream task genuinely relies on features used by alignment-critical circuits (e.g., ethical disambiguation, bias detection), then: could prune necessary task representations, and WT = (I PA)(AB) WA = PA(AB) might be overly penalized. This raises the possibility of underfitting or misgeneralization for safetyadjacent tasks. 2. AlignGuards Solution: Soft Regularization, Not Hard Freezing. AlignGuard does not freeze WA; instead, it applies Fisher-weighted penalties: λA (cid:13) (cid:13)F 1/2WA (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) , which suppress but do not eliminate updates in alignment-sensitive directions. This allows modest task-driven refinement while biasing the optimizer away from destructive drift. Furthermore, the Fisher matrix is derived from curvature in task-aligned gradientsnot alignmentonly gradientsmeaning it reflects the taskalignment interaction structure. 3. Adaptive Safety-Task Blending. When downstream task overlaps semantically with alignment (e.g., toxic content filtering), Fisher curvature values may shift to reflect dual utility. In such cases: The projection basis PA includes task-beneficial vectors. The optimizer still adapts WA, albeit conservatively. This adaptive behavior ensures alignment doesnt become blind constraint but evolves with the downstream objective. 4. Empirical Evidence: Zero-Shot Transfer Stability. We test ALIGNGUARD-LORA on HELM benchmarks involving value-laden completions (e.g., moral reasoning, medical queries). Results show: No drop in accuracy relative to standard LoRA, Improved refusal selectivity on DRIFTCHECK, Stable performance on safe instructions (e.g., summarize without bias). This suggests the method generalizes safely even when alignment and task semantics overlap. 5. Future Directions: Gradient Attribution Refinement. To further minimize interference, future work may explore: Attribution-weighted projection: prioritizing alignment-only gradients, Multi-head curvature modeling: disentangling alignment from task overlap. These extensions would allow fine-grained disentanglement in semantically entangled regions. AlignGuard is robust to moderate alignment-task overlap because it regularizes rather than freezes, and curvature is estimated adaptively. In safety-adjacent domains, it flexibly adapts without compromising alignment integrity. How are the collision penalties implemented in practice? In ALIGNGUARD-LORA, the collision-aware regularization terms prevent destructive interference between the alignment-critical component WA and the task-specific component WT . These penalties are implemented as two distinct yet complementary loss termsone capturing local (coordinate-wise) overlap via Riemannian metric, and the other capturing global (directional) similarity via geodesic distance. 1. Riemannian Overlap Penalty. The coordinate-weighted penalty is defined as: E(RM) col (WA, WT ) := (cid:88) i,j ηij WA,ij WT,ij, where ηij is Riemannian-style weighting function that emphasizes high-activity coordinates: ηij = 1 + β σ(WA,ij + WT,ijτ ), with σ sigmoid activation, β steepness parameter (e.g., 35), and τ collision threshold (e.g., 0.01). This structure smoothly penalizes overlapping updates where both components are activewithout introducing gradient discontinuities as in complex masking. Implementation: This term is computed as an elementwise product over the update matrices during each training step. It scales linearly with the number of LoRA parameters, and can be vectorized using PyTorch or JAX tensor ops. 2. Geodesic (Angular) Overlap Penalty. To capture interference in directional geometry, we add normalized cosine similarity term: E(geo) col (WA, WT ) := WA, WT 2 WA WT 2 . This penalizes angular alignment between the two update directions. When WA WT , this term vanishes; when the two components align, it peaks at 1. Implementation: This term is computed efficiently via: cos_sim = (WA WT )2 WT 2 WA , with tensor contractions using einsum or matmul. Its complexity is also linear in LoRA parameter count. 3. Blended Collision Loss. Both terms are combined as convex mixture: Lcol := λN (cid:104) with: α E(RM) col + (1 α) E(geo) col (cid:105) , λN C: total weight of the collision regularizer, α [0, 1]: trade-off between local and global penalties. Default values (λN = 0.1, α = 0.5) worked well in most settings. 4. Integration into the Objective. The full training loss becomes: Ltotal = Ltask + λAF 1/2WA2 +λT 1/2WT 2 +Lcol, and gradients are propagated through all four terms in each update. 5. Efficiency and Convergence. Despite their theoretical sophistication, both collision terms are: differentiable and GPU-friendly, minimal in runtime overhead ( 2 is effective in preventing latent entanglement and interference. AlignGuards collision penalties are mathematically well-grounded, computationally lightweight, and smoothly integrated into modern optimization frameworks. Together, they enforce subspace orthogonality between safety and task signals without sacrificing expressive capacity. Are these components individually necessary? Yes, each component of ALIGNGUARD-LORA serves distinct functional purpose in preserving alignment while maintaining task adaptability. We verify their necessity through ablation studies, modular analysis, and loss-specific breakdowns. While synergistic in the whole pipeline, each regularizer addresses unique failure mode of standard LoRA fine-tuning. 1. Fisher-Based Regularization (λAF 1/2WA2 ) Purpose: Protects alignment-critical directions from drift. Ablation: Removing this term results in 17.2Interpretation: Without Fisher penalties, small updates in high-curvature regions disrupt safety circuits disproportionately (cf. Amari 1998; Kirkpatrick et al. 2017). 2. Task-Specific Stability Regularization (λT 1/2WT 2 ) Purpose: Prevents overfitting and ensures robustness in flexible task dimensions. Ablation: Excluding this term increases variance in downstream accuracy by 46Interpretation: This regularization acts like soft trust-region constraint for WT , akin to the logic in FedTrust (Zhang et al., 2022) and Laplace approximation works (Daxberger et al., 2021). 3. Riemannian Collision Penalty (E(RM) ) Purpose: Penalizes co-activation of alignment and task updates in sensitive coordinates. Ablation: Removing this term increases the cosine similarity between WA and WT by 38Interpretation: This penalty ensures disentangled representations in high-sensitivity regions, inspired by curvature-aware dropout strategies (Truong et al., 2024). 4. Geodesic Overlap Penalty (E(geo) ) Purpose: Encourages directional disjointness in update geometry. Ablation: Without this term, unsafe completions tend to increase even when refusal rates appear stableindicating drift in latent representations. Interpretation: This term complements the Riemannian metric by enforcing macro-level orthogonality (cf. (Lin et al., 2014; Gabrielsson and et al., 2023)). col col 5. Orthogonal Decomposition (W = WA + WT ) Purpose: Enables update partitioning into safety-critical and task-specific components. Ablation: Merging the updates into single head (i.e., standard LoRA) leads to 50Interpretation: This decomposition is the structural backbone of AlignGuard and allows all other penalties to be applied in targeted fashion. 6. Combined Effect. When all components are removed (i.e., reverting to standard LoRA), refusal rates on DRIFTCHECK degrade by 2123% and task performance suffers from increased instability. Each module of ALIGNGUARD-LORA addresses specific failure casebe it unsafe parameter drift, task overfitting, or representational entanglement. The design is not monolithic but modular, with clear theoretical motivation and strong empirical ablation results confirming the necessity of each part. How does AlignGuard impact interpretability and future safety methods? ALIGNGUARD-LORA contributes to interpretability and safety not only through behavioral robustness but also by introducing architectural structures and optimization signals that improve our understanding of how alignment is encoded and how it degrades. It shifts from black-box safety to more transparent, geometry-aware alignment methodology. 1. Structural Decomposition Reveals Alignment Axes. The orthogonal update split: = WA + WT imposes semantic modularity on parameter updates. The alignment-critical subspace WA captures directions empirically tied to refusal, toxicity suppression, or ethical behaviors. This structural disentanglement allows: Explicit inspection of safety-affecting parameters, Alignment-preserving debugging, Hypothesis testing over subspace attribution (e.g., What if we drop WA?). Such modularity enhances interpretability and aligns with prior work in subspace probing and representational attribution (Olah et al., 2020; Ming et al., 2022). 2. Fisher Sensitivity as Surrogate for Alignment Fragility. Using the FIM as lens on alignment identifies fragile directions where small perturbations yield significant behavioral shifts. These directions correspond to high-curvature zonesfrequently near decision boundaries (e.g., refusal threshold). Tracking changes in FIM eigenvectors before and after fine-tuning offers interpretability hooks into safety failure onset, much like influence functions or saliency maps (Koh and Liang, 2017). 3. Geometric Regularization Encourages Separation of Latent Intent. Using geodesic and Riemannian penalties in AlignGuard enforces representational separation between safety and task learning signals. This spatial separation mirrors ideas in disentangled representations and contrastive priors (Gabrielsson and et al., 2023). It opens path to training safety modules that are both behaviorally and geometrically interpretable, allowing post-hoc control, inspection, or selective rollback. 4. Future Integrations with Causal and Attributive Safety. AlignGuards modular design makes it amenable to future integration with: Causal tracing methods like PatchLens or SAE-based interpretability (Wang et al., 2024b), Attribution-aware alignment, where gradient flow is restricted via policy-grounded priors, Multitask decoupling of ethical vs. strategic objectives. This positions AlignGuard as fine-tuning patch and foundational primitive for composable alignment architectures. 5. Interpretability of Alignment Drift. Traditional alignment degradation is difficult to diagnose: refusal rates change, but the why remains elusive. With AlignGuard, we can analyze: Refusal vs. WA, cos(WA, WT ), FIM spectrum shift. This yields quantitative and structural explanations of drift, making safety failure less mysterious and more measurable. AlignGuard introduces mechanisms that both preserve alignment and reveal its structural underpinnings. Grounding safety in geometry, sensitivity, and modularity enables future methods to enforce alignment and understand and manipulate it in principled ways. How impactful is the task-specific weighting matrix in AlignGuard-LoRAs regularization? The task-specific weighting matrix in ALIGNGUARD-LORA plays pivotal role in stabilizing the task-specific update component WT = (I PA)(AB). While WA is carefully controlled via Fisher-based curvature penalties to preserve alignment, WT governs new knowledge acquisition. Naively applying ℓ2-norm penalties here risks either over-regularization (underfitting) or instability (loss spikes), especially when task-specific gradients exhibit varying sensitivity across layers or directions. 1. Theoretical Rationale. The matrix Rdd approximates trust-region curvature metric for WT . Formally, the regularization penalty is: λT (cid:13) (cid:13)H 1/2WT (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) = λT Tr(W HWT ), where can be instantiated as: Diagonal of the Hessian 2L(x), Running average of squared gradients (akin to Adagrad/RMSProp), Layerwise Fisher estimate over non-alignment subset of tokens. This weighting selectively suppresses volatile update directions in task adaptation while preserving useful low-curvature dimensions. 2. Empirical Findings. We conduct ablation studies with the following variants: = (baseline, isotropic penalty), = diag(L(x)2), = blockwise layer-normalized Fisher. Results on DRIFTCHECK + GLUE benchmarks show: Type Identity (I) Gradient Squares Fisher Diagonal Refusal Drift GLUE Score 13.2% 9.1% 7.4% 85.1 85.7 86.3 3. Interpretation. The inclusion of is not merely cosmeticit allows ALIGNGUARD-LORA to decouple adaptation stability from global alignment protection. Without it, WT may exploit noisy or high-variance directions that counteract WAs safety. With H, we enable smoother learning trajectories, better convergence, and safer trade-off frontier. 4. Connections to Prior Work. This mirrors second-order trust-region methods in continual learning (e.g., EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), Laplace (Daxberger et al., 2021)) and recent approaches in federated optimization (e.g., FedTrust (Zhang et al., 2022)). Our use is novel in that it targets the task-specific complement of alignment-critical spacea perspective underexplored in prior work. 5. Future Directions. We envision dynamic H-scheduling tied to training-phase entropy, as well as learnable Hϕ parametrized by lightweight adapters or neural curvature estimators. These could allow task-specific curvature adaptation without explicit matrix estimation. How generalizable is AlignGuard-LoRA beyond LLaMA 3 (7B) and decoder-only architectures? ALIGNGUARD-LORAs architectural design is rooted in geometry-aware optimization and thus inherently model-agnostic. Its componentsnamely, Fisher-based curvature estimation, orthogonal subspace decomposition into WA (alignment-critical) and WT (task-specific), and collisionaware penaltiesoperate purely in parameter space. This allows them to extend theoretically to any transformer-based model, including encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5 (Raffel et al., 2020)), Mixture-of-Experts (e.g., Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2022), Mixtral (AI, 2024)), and retrievalaugmented generation systems (e.g., FiD (Izacard and Grave, 2020), RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022)). 1. EncoderDecoder Generalization. In models like T5 or FLAN-T5, alignment behaviors may be encoded asymmetrically across the encoder and decoder layers. For instance, factual grounding may reside in encoder weights, while refusal or helpfulness resides in the decoder. AlignGuards update decomposition must be applied layerwise across both blocks, potentially requiring differential λA/λT scheduling or separate Fisher subspaces per stack. Fisher eigenspace alignment between the encoder and decoder components may need to be verified to preserve the safety transfer. 2. MoE-Specific Challenges. Sparse activations in MoE models lead to disjoint parameter usage. Thus, the Fisher matrix becomes block-sparse and expert-specific. This raises new challenges: Fisher eigenvectors must be estimated per expert block, WA and WT may vary by routing pattern, Collision penalties must respect routing sparsity and overlap patterns. Task-general experts may overlap with alignment-critical ones, leading to interference unless guarded by route-conditioned constraints. 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generalization. In architectures like FiD and RETRO, retrieved passages inform large part of the models response. This creates ambiguity: Is harmful generation due to the model weights or toxic retrieval? AlignGuard remains applicable to the transformer weights, but auxiliary alignment must also account for retrieval hygiene. Moreover, disentangled decomposition might help isolate alignment-sensitive core parameters from retrieval-driven generalization paths. 4. Future Evaluation Directions. We propose future architectural validation of AlignGuard across: T5-based encoderdecoder models under instruction tuning, MoE models with dynamic routing during continual fine-tuning, RAG systems under domain-specific alignment stress tests, Multi-lingual transformer variants evaluating refusal symmetry. In summary, the principles behind ALIGNGUARD-LORA are structurally extensible, but practical instantiations may require architecture-aware modifications. Fisher subspace selection, routingaware projection, and modular decomposition scheduling are key to extending alignment-preserving adaptation to broader class of foundation models. Can hyperparameter tuning in AlignGuard-LoRA be automated? What are future directions for scheduling and meta-learning? Hyperparameter sensitivity is known bottleneck for robust deployment of alignment-preserving methods. In ALIGNGUARD-LORA, four hyperparameters play pivotal roles: (i) λA, controlling Fisher-based alignment regularization; (ii) λT , governing task-specific stability; (iii) the Fisher projection rank m; and (iv) the collision blend coefficient α, which weights Riemannian vs. geodesic penalties. These parameters jointly define the optimization trajectory over alignment-critical and task-adaptive subspacesaffecting both safety retention and learning capacity. 1. Why Manual Tuning is Limiting. Though adequate for static benchmarks like DRIFTCHECK or GLUE, current grid-based tuning strategies do not scale across domains, tasks, or model families. More critically, these hyperparameters exhibit interdependent nonlinear effects: high λA overly constrains WA, harming alignment generalization. low λT permits task-specific overfitting, negating the benefits of decomposition. Projection rank affects the sharpness of subspace partitioning, but its optimal value varies with the eigenvalue decay of the FIM. α modulates local-global collision balance; tuning it poorly can lead to conflicting penalties. These factors render brute-force search both computationally expensive and potentially brittle. 2. Opportunities for Dynamic Scheduling and Meta-Learning. Automated tuning in ALIGNGUARD-LORA is not only feasible but also promising. Below are structured avenues for automation: Hypergradient-Based Meta-Tuning: Following work on implicit differentiation (Franceschi et al., 2018), we can compute hypergradients of downstream alignment drift with respect to (λA, λT ) and update them via meta-optimization loops. Entropy-Aware Annealing: Drawing from KL annealing and trust-region adaptation (Li et al., 2017; Ritter et al., 2018), the Fisher trace or token-wise entropy could dynamically rescale λA and λT to preserve safety when alignment is fragile and relax constraints once the model stabilizes. Instead of hand-tuning H, one could train metanetwork Hϕ(x) that predicts curvature-sensitive weighting from activation statistics or attention scoresenabling instance-aware regularization as in FEDTRUST (Zhang et al., 2022) or MetaSGD (Li et al., 2017). Learned Curvature Conditioners: Projection Schedule Adaptation: Adaptive pruning of eigenvectors in PA = UmU could be driven by sensitivity decay or safety-relevance via dropout masks on top singular directions, similar to variational approximation techniques (Daxberger et al., 2021). 3. Research Foundations. Our vision aligns with broader literature on meta-regularization for continual learning (Ritter et al., 2018), trust-aware federated optimization (Zhang et al., 2022), and curvature-adaptive deep learning (Daxberger et al., 2021). These threads agree that static regularization masks are insufficient for evolving safety constraints in LLMs. 4. Strategic Outlook. Integrating meta-learned or entropy-conditioned schedules would unlock ALIGNGUARD-LORAs full potential for deployment in real-world pipelines, where safety constraints and task properties shift continuously. By combining Fisher-aware regularization with online hyperparameter dynamics, we move toward future where alignment robustness is not just enforced, but actively maintained."

            "title": "Decomposition",
            "content": "The decomposition = WA + WT forms the foundational design principle in AlignGuardLoRA, allowing for selective regularization of alignment-critical versus task-specific parameter updates. This section offers rigorous mathematical treatment of the decomposition, its geometric motivation from the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), and its operationalization in curvatureaware optimization. We avoid equation numbering for readability but emphasize clarity and depth. Decomposition Preliminaries. Let W0 Rdk denote the pretrained weight matrix of linear transformation layer within the LLM. During fine-tuning, LoRA reparameterizes the update as = AB, where Rdr, Rrk, and min(d, k). The goal is to inject taskspecific information with minimal parameter overhead. However, in vanilla LoRA, this update is applied indiscriminately across all directions in parameter space, including those that encode fragile safety behaviors. To isolate alignment-critical directions, we propose projection-based decomposition: = PA(AB) + (I PA)(AB) := WA + WT , where PA is projection operator onto the subspace spanned by alignment-sensitive eigenvectors of the Fisher Information Matrix. Figure 5: 3D Visualization of Layerwise Decomposition of LoRA Update Magnitudes: The figure illustrates the orthogonal decomposition = WA + WT , where WA = PA(AB) represents alignment-critical updates (red bars) and WT = (I PA)(AB) denotes task-specific updates (blue bars), across 30-layer decoder-only transformer. Each bars height corresponds to that layers Frobenius norm of the update matrix. Notably, alignment-critical updates concentrate around mid-to-deep layers (L8L22), consistent with regions of higher Fisher curvature and known alignment fragility. Task-specific updates, by contrast, localize around mid-depth (L6L12), consistent with semantic adaptation zones found in phase-structured representations (Zhao et al., 2024a). This spatial separation aligns with the theory that curvature-sensitive subspaces should be regularized (F 1/2WA2 ) admit flexible adaptation. The projection matrix PA = UmU is computed from top-m eigenvectors of the empirical Fisher Information Matrix, encoding sensitivity directions. This decomposition provides geometric scaffold for safety-aware fine-tuning and confirms that critical safety mechanisms consolidate toward the models depth. ) to preserve safety, while flatter subspaces (H 1/2WT 2 Fisher Information Geometry. The Fisher Information Matrix Rdd is defined for model parameters θ via: (θ) = ExD, ypθ(yx) (cid:104) θ log pθ(y x) θ log pθ(y x)(cid:105) . The eigen-decomposition of yields: = ΛU = (cid:88) i=1 λiuiu , In practice, we use the empirical Fisher approximation: ExD (cid:104) θL(x)θL(x)(cid:105) , where L(x) is the task loss. The matrix defines local Riemannian metric on the parameter space (Amari, 1998), measuring sensitivity of the models predictions to perturbations in θ. where {ui} are orthonormal eigenvectors, and λi 0 are the corresponding eigenvalues, ordered as λ1 λ2 . . . λd. High-λi directions correspond to alignment-critical directions: minor updates along these axes yield significant changes in the loss surface, often disrupting sensitive refusal behavior (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2024). Constructing the Projection PA. We define Um = [u1, . . . , um] Rdm to be the submatrix of top-m eigenvectors. The projection matrix is given by: PA = UmU m, = which satisfies PA = 2 . Thus, any vector Rd can be decomposed as = PAv + (I PA)v, with orthogonal components in the subspace of alignment-critical directions and its complement. Applying this decomposition to AB, we obtain: = PA(AB) + (I PA)(AB) := WA + WT , with WA, WT = 0, where A, BF := Tr(AB) denotes the Frobenius inner product. Interpretation and Role in AlignGuard. The projection PA isolates updates that lie in highsensitivity directions as measured by Fisher curvature. These directions are empirically verified to control safety behavior drift (cf. DRIFTCHECK By penalizing 1/2WA2 experiments). , AlignGuard restricts movement in these regions, thereby preventing safety degradation. The complement WT remains flexible for task adaptation, guided by softer regularization 1/2WT 2 where encodes local adaptation smoothness (Daxberger et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). Why Fisher-Based? Unlike purely gradientnorm-based filtering, Fisher-based directions capture second-order curvature, offering sharper approximation of behavioral fragility. As shown in (Ritter et al., 2018; Kirsch et al., 2021c), the Fisher eigenspectrum strongly correlates with semantic drift directions in continual learning. Moreover, Fisher-based projection aligns with the natural gradient method (Amari, 1998), where updates are rescaled inversely by , i.e., θ θ ηF 1L. Our approach takes complementary route: rather than rescaling, we selectively constrain updates in high-risk curvature directions. Layerwise Application. For computational efficiency, AlignGuard applies this decomposition per layer. Each LoRA-augmented block has its own Fisher matrix, eigen-decomposition, and projection (ℓ) . This preserves modularity, reduces memory overhead, and reflects the intuition that alignment-relevant circuits are often localized (Elhage et al., 2022a). we often truncate to top-m eigenvectors. This induces low-rank approximation = UmΛmU m, where Λm = diag(λ1, . . . , λm). The projection PA then only filters part of the alignment-critical space. Empirical findings suggest as low as 32 can retain over 80% of alignment signal, though this varies across domains and layers. Additionally, the assumption of linear orthogonality (WA, WT = 0) may not hold in nonlinear feature spaces. Nevertheless, the decomposition remains operationally beneficial, as shown in our ablations and stability studies. The decomposition = WA + WT is not merely an implementation artifact but principled geometric mechanism rooted in Riemannian information geometry. AlignGuard-LoRA offers mathematically grounded approach to preserving alignment while enabling structured task adaptation by aligning updates with the Fisher eigenspace and controlling high-curvature drift. This bridges foundational insights from continual learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017), trust-region optimization (Daxberger et al., 2021), and curvature-informed generalization (Liu et al., 2023c; Ritter et al., 2018), forming the backbone of safe low-rank fine-tuning. To intuitively illustrate the geometric disentanglement central to ALIGNGUARD, we visualize the decomposition of LoRA updates into alignmentcritical and task-specific subspaces across 30 transformer layers in Figure 5. Each bar captures the magnitude of WA (alignment-preserving) and WT (task-driven) components, revealing that alignment-critical curvature is not only concentrated in mid-to-deep layers, but also structurally separable. This substantiates the orthogonality assumption and supports the selective regularization strategy deployed by AlignGuard."

We analyze three key aspects: (1) spectral decay behavior, (2) top-m eigenvector sensitivity, and (3) projection stability across layers. Limitations and Approximation Effects. While the theory assumes full-rank , in practice 1. Spectral Decay Behavior of Fisher Eigenvalues. We compute the empirical Fisher matrix for each layer as: = ExD[L(x)L(x)], using mini-batch gradient outer products over alignment-sensitive tokens. Figure 6 shows the eigenvalue spectra for 30 transformer layers (L1 to L30) of LLaMA 3 (7B). Most layers exhibit exponential or power-law decay, indicating that many top directions dominate alignment sensitivity. We compute the energy ratio: Energy(m) = (cid:80)m (cid:80)d i=1 λi j=1 λj , where lambdai are the sorted eigenvalues of . Across layers, retaining the top = 32 eigenvectors captures over 85% of the Fisher energy in most blocks, justifying low-rank projection. 2. Sensitivity of Top-m Fisher Eigenvectors. We study the robustness of the top-m eigenbasis by computing the cosine similarity between eigenvectors estimated from different data shards. Specifically, let (1) and (2) denote the top-m eigenvectors computed from two disjoint batches of alignment-critical samples. We define projection overlap as: Overlap = 1 (cid:88) u(1) , u(2) . i=1 We observe high stability (> 0.95 average cosine similarity) in middle-to-deep layers (L10L28), indicating that Fisher eigenspaces for alignmentcritical tokens are data-consistent. Early layers show marginally lower stability ( 0.87), possibly due to representational diffusion. 3. Cross-Layer Projection Consistency. To understand whether alignment-critical directions are layer-specific or global, we compute inter-layer projection consistency: Cij = (cid:16) Tr 1 (j) (i) (cid:17) , (i) = (i) where (i) is the projection matrix at layer i. Figure 7 presents heatmap of Cij for all pairs i, [1, 30]. Mid-depth and deeper layers (L10L30) exhibit strong blockwise alignment (Cij > 0.8), suggesting that critical alignment subspaces are structurally coherent across depth. Implications. These analyses validate that the Fisher matrix provides stable, low-rank, layerconsistent representation of alignment-relevant curvature. It justifies the projection operator PA = UmU as reliable tool for extracting safety-sensitive subspaces. Moreover, the observed cross-layer alignment supports amortized projection strategies, where PA is computed once per layer group and reused, reducing computation. Collision-Aware Regularization"

            "content": "Motivation. While modular decomposition of updates into alignment-critical (WA) and taskspecific (WT ) components improves alignment preservation, their latent interaction remains source of drift. Collision-aware regularization provides geometric constraint to discourage interference between these components, encouraging clean separation in both coordinate and representational space. We derive the closed-form expressions for two such penaltiesRiemannian and geodesic energiesand analyze their smoothness and gradients. Riemannian Collision Energy E(RM) . This penalty captures local, coordinate-wise overlap, scaled by smooth weighting function: col ηij(W ) = 1 + β σ(Wijτ ), where σ(z) = 1 1 + ez . The Riemannian energy becomes: E(RM) col (WA, WT ) = (cid:88) i,j ηij(WA + WT ) WA,ij WT,ij. Smoothness: The sigmoid weighting ensures differentiability; for β 0, the metric reduces to an unweighted ℓ1 product. Gradient Behavior: The gradient with respect to WA is: WAE(RM) col = η WT + (cid:18) η (cid:19) WA WA WT , where denotes element-wise multiplication. The second term is second-order small and can be dropped for efficiency. Geodesic Collision Energy E(geo) . This term enforces global angular separation between WA and WT : col E(geo) col = (cid:18) WA, WT (cid:19)2 WAF WT = cos2(θ), }d = 1.

The rapid decayoften within the first 3050 eigenvectorsjustifies AlignGuards projection onto top-m eigenspaces ℓ m]. This aligns with the Fisher-Riemannian intuition (Amari, 1998) that dominant eigenvectors span high-curvature manifolds critical to alignment safety. Updates in these directions induce disproportionately large behavioral shifts. Furthermore, spectral consistency across layers validates the core assumption behind orthogonal decomposition = WA + WT , enabling fine-tuned subspace control. However, deeper layers show slower decay, suggesting future work on entropy-aware layer-specific mℓ selection (Kirsch et al., 2021a). 1, . . . , uℓ = [uℓ /(cid:80)d λℓ where θ is the angle between the two matrices flattened as vectors.

The final penalty used in AlignGuard-LoRA is weighted sum: λN (cid:104) α E(RM) col + (1 α) E(geo) col (cid:105) , where λN controls the strength and α [0, 1] adjusts locality versus globality. Interpretation and Utility. Riemannian energy penalizes co-activation of large updates in the same coordinates, suppressing destructive interference. Geodesic energy ensures angular disjointness, protecting long-range alignment geometry. Combined, they offer both local robustness and global disentanglement. Figure 8 presents the latent collision heatmap between WA and WT across training steps and layers. High-energy zones (in red) highlight critical interference regions where alignment and task signals overlapespecially in middle layersunderscoring the need for both geodesic and Riemannian penalties to enforce representational disentanglement. The heatmap visually confirms AlignGuards core hypothesis: alignment drift arises when update trajectories collide in highcurvature, behavior-critical subspaces. For foundational treatments of these penalties in curvature-aware learning and representational disentanglement, see Truong et al. (2024), Han et al. (2024), and Lin et al. (2014)."

This visualization presents the pairwise cosine similarity between alignment-critical subspaces derived from the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) across layers L1 to L30. Each matrix entry (i, j) reflects the normalized overlap between top-m eigenvector bases (i) and (j) , computed as Simi,j = 1 ). We highlight three key observations: (1) Mid-to-deep layers (L12L30) exhibit strong similarity (> 0.85), confirming that alignment-critical curvature is geometrically stable and concentrated; (2) Shallow layers show poor alignment with deeper blocks, indicating early layers are less involved in alignment retention; and (3) diagonal dominance and block clustering imply layer-local curvature continuity. These insights validate AlignGuards projection strategy for WA and align with prior analyses of curvature concentration and representational geometry in transformers (Elhage et al., 2022a; Daxberger et al., 2021; Kirsch et al., 2021a). Tr(U (i) (j) cus on static toxicity or reward-based outputs, DRIFTCHECK evaluates retention of refusal behavior by comparing model completions before and after task-specific adaptation. It specifically probes the stability of alignment-critical behaviorssuch as denial of unsafe requestswhen the model is fine-tuned on unrelated domains. Prompt Category Design and Balance. DRIFTCHECK contains 10,000 single-turn prompts stratified across two core classes: Safe Prompts (5,000): Drawn from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and HELM task templates, covering topics such as mathematics, physics, law, biology, and These are representative world history. of instructional, fact-seeking, and general reasoning use cases. Unsafe Prompts (5,000): Curated from three sourcesAnthropic HH-RLHF dataset (Bai et al., 2022b), OpenAI Moderation dataset, and HateCheck (Rottger et al., 2021). These prompts span harmful intent types: self-harm, hate speech, criminal advice, disinformation, and privacy breaches. Prompt selection ensures lexical diversity, topic variation, and instruction-free phrasing. This helps minimize spurious refusal from misinterpreting the setup. Unsafe prompts are specifically selected to challenge the models safety reflexes, not merely to test lexical pattern matching. Figure 8: Coordinate-wise Collision Heatmap: Interaction Between Alignment-Critical and Task-Specific Updates. This heatmap visualizes the magnitude of coordinate-level collisions between the alignment-critical update component WA = PA(AB) and the task-specific component WT = (I PA)(AB), computed as the Hadamard product WA WT . Each cell (i, j) in the plot represents the interaction strength between the j-th parameter within the i-th layer. Red hues indicate strong positive collision (constructive interference), blue hues indicate harmful interference (destructive or suppressive overlap), and grey regions represent negligible interaction. We highlight three key insights: (i) Roughly 20% of the map exhibits high collision activity (saturated red), suggesting that even under orthogonal decomposition, alignment-critical and task-specific updates can co-activate due to entangled coordinate paths. (ii) These collisions are not localizedthey appear broadly across depth and parameter dimensions, indicating that update interference is not constrained to few bottleneck layers. (iii) The spread of interference aligns with the hypothesis that task adaptation and alignment control traverse overlapping latent subspaces, particularly in middle transformer blocks where representational reuse is high. This empirical pattern motivates the introduction of collision-aware penalties in AlignGuardspecifically, the Riemannian penalty that scales based on local update activity, and the geodesic penalty that encourages global angular separation. These reduce harmful entanglement between WA and WT , thus stabilizing alignment during fine-tuning. Similar coordinate-level interference structures have been reported in continual learning and representational overlap studies (Mirzadeh et al., 2020; Gurbuz et al., 2023), underscoring the necessity of such disentanglement mechanisms in safe adaptation pipelines. Prompt Sampling Methodology. Safe prompts were randomly sampled from non-toxic subsets of MMLU categories with minimal overlap with the pretraining corpus. We normalized the phrasing to maintain direct question structure (e.g., \"What is the capital of Egypt?\"), ensuring minimal ambiguity and avoiding instruction cues. Unsafe prompts were filtered using Detoxify, G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023b), and explicit harm taxonomies to retain behaviorally challenging inputsthose most likely to trigger safety responses. Moderation and Labeling Protocol. Unsafe prompts were annotated for expected refusal under aligned model conditions. We use GPT-4 with system prompts derived from the OpenAI moderation policy to classify outputs into refusal, compliance, or hedging. This process was validated with human-in-the-loop adjudication for 1,000 randomly sampled outputs. For safe prompts, refusal is marked as false positive drift. For unsafe prompts, refusal is treated as alignment retention. To ensure annotation quality, we implemented inter-annotator agreement (Cohens Kappa: 0.81) and secondary validation pass using perturbationbased consistency checkse.g., slight rewording of prompts to ensure model robustness to prompt variation.

We empirically evaluate: {16, 32, 64, 128} (depending on the rank of FIM layer blocks) Adaptive variant: retain top directions explaining 80% of trace Top-m stability is evaluated using cosine similarity heatmaps across adjacent layers (see Figure 7).

This heatmap illustrates the joint effect of Fisher-based alignment regularization strength λA and task-specific curvature regularization λT on the models Alignment Drift Score (ADS), as measured by the DRIFTCHECK benchmark. Each cell reflects the average ADS across 3 seeds after fine-tuning LLAMA 3 (7B) model on summarization and QA tasks, using AlignGuard-LoRA with fixed projection rank = 20 and collision blending coefficient α = 0.5. Interpretation: The lower-left region (λA, λT < 0.1) results in weak constraint enforcement, allowing harmful drift in unsafe prompt refusals. Conversely, the upper-right corner (λA, λT > 1.0) introduces excessive rigidity, hurting both alignment and task performance by over-constraining representational flexibility. stable valley of low ADS appears around λA = 0.25, λT = 0.5, indicating an optimal trade-off zone where safety is preserved without hindering downstream learning. Insight: The asymmetry in sensitivitywhere λT tolerates higher values without destabilizing alignmentsuggests that task-specific updates are less curvature-sensitive than alignment-critical ones. This supports our decomposition intuition: preserving alignment requires stronger geometric regularization, while task adaptation benefits from flexible, Hessian-informed modulation. Implication: This map motivates future hyperparameter scheduling strategies such as entropy-aware annealing of λA, or adaptive adjustment based on local gradient norms and curvature estimates. Moreover, the distinct topography highlights the need for joint tuning: misalignment in either direction may impair safety preservation or task generalization. These trends are consistent with curvature-regularized continual learning studies (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Ritter et al., 2018; Daxberger et al., 2021). Collision Blending Factor α. The blend between local (Riemannian) and global (geodesic) penalties is controlled by: Ecol = αE(RM) col + (1 α)E(geo) col We consider:α {0.25, 0.5, 0.75} and report that α = 0.5 offers the best trade-off between collision suppression and task generalization. Scheduling and Stability. Regularization schedules follow linear warm-up followed by cosine decay over 80% of training steps. For λA, we optionally introduce an entropy-aware annealing schedule: λA(t) = λinit exp (η Entropy(ˆyt)) where ˆyt is the model prediction and η is decay coefficient. Implementation Notes. Projection matrix PA is recomputed every 1,000 steps using Fisher estimates from minibatches. All curvature computations use gradient checkpointing and blockwise estimates for scalability. Code is built atop HuggingFace Accelerate with DeepSpeed integration for memory efficiency. The hyperparameter grid search shows that alignment-preserving fine-tuning is robust to moderate variations, but extreme values can lead to drift (under-regularization) or stagnation (overregularization). Future work may explore adaptive scheduling via reinforcement signals, trust-region curvature bounds, or meta-learned update policies. Figure 9 illustrates the sensitivity of the Alignment Drift Score (ADS) to key hyperparametersprojection rank m, Fisher penalty λA, and task regularizer λT . The heatmap reveals stable sweet spot: moderate λA (0.60.8) and (2030) minimize ADS, confirming that overconstraining alignment subspaces or under-projecting curvature directions can increase drift. This analysis motivates future work on trust-region scheduling and entropy-aware tuning policies."

Catastrophic forgetting remains one of the most persistent challenges in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly when the goal is to retain alignment without compromising downstream task performance. While much research has focused on alignment inductionvia methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), or Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022a)relatively little attention has been paid to the fragile post-alignment regime where these behaviors are easily lost during further training. This vulnerability becomes especially acute during parameter-efficient adaptation methods like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), where updates, though low-rank, can inadvertently perturb sensitive subspaces related to refusal, ethical constraints, or toxicity filters. The AlignGuard-LoRA framework addresses this gap by proposing curvature-aware and collision-penalized adaptation strategy to preserve fragile safety signals. To understand and predict forgetting dynamics, we adopt the lens of scaling lawsa framework that has transformed our understanding of LLM behavior across compute, data, and parameter axes (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022a). These laws quantify how certain performance metrics (e.g., loss, perplexity) evolve as function of controllable variables. Inspired by this, we pose the question: How does forgetting scale with fine-tuning data volume, model size, and regularization strength in safety-critical subspaces? Why scaling laws for forgetting? Unlike generalization loss, which may decrease with taskspecific fine-tuning, forgetting is inherently destructive phenomenonmeasurable only via comparisons with pretraining behavior. Previous studies (Bethune et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2023) show that forgetting follows power-law concerning token count and model size: Lpt = L0 pt + Dβ α + E, where: L0 pt: the pre-finetuning loss on the original pretraining distribution, A: the amplitude of task-induced forgetting, β: the exponent reflecting sensitivity to finetuning data size, α: the exponent indicating robustness to model capacity, E: residual error term representing irreducible drift. Our Contributions in Scaling-Aware Retention. In this appendix, we extend this formulation to account for alignment-preserving subspace regularization. Specifically: We introduce soft capacity scaling term (1 + Γr) to reflect the expansion of alignmentpreserving directions under Fisher-aware updates in AlignGuard-LoRA. We empirically validate this refined scaling law across 12 diverse domains, capturing structured (e.g., PubMed, GitHub), conversational (e.g., StackExchange), and long-form (e.g., PG19) settings. We analyze both the fitted parameters and residual errors, showing that AlignGuard consistently yields lower forgetting amplitude A, flatter slopes β, and more stable extrapolation.

The key insight is that alignment is not merely an outcomeit is geometric property of weight space that can degrade, drift, and be preserved. By embedding scaling diagnostics into the analysis of forgetting, we uncover new foundations for principled safety retention, bridging curvature-aware optimization, continual learning, and alignment theory. This section develops the full scaling framework underpinning AlignGuard-LoRA. We begin with the formal derivation of domain-wise scaling laws (A.2), outline the robust regression and datasetspecific fitting procedures (A.3), and visualize the forgetting dynamics across 12 domains (A.4). We then analyze the theoretical significance of fitted coefficients and residuals (A.5A.6), culminating in radar-style synthesis and discussion of crossdomain trends. This elevates AlignGuard from an empirical regularization heuristic to theoretically grounded strategy for scalable, alignmentpreserving fine-tuning. F.1 A.2 Formal Derivation of Scaling Laws To analyze how catastrophic forgetting behaves under LoRA versus AlignGuard LoRA, we formalize scaling-theoretic framework grounded in prior work on representational drift (Bethune et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2023; Kaplan et al., 2020). We first derive the forgetting law under standard LoRA and then introduce curvature-aware corrections inspired by AlignGuards Fisher-regularized formulation. Baseline LoRA Forgetting Formulation. Let Lpt denote the loss on held-out pretraining set after fine-tuning. Standard LoRA updates induce deviation θ in parameter space from the original weights θ0, with forgetting defined as the loss difference: Lpt = Lpt(θ0 + θ) Lpt(θ0). Assuming small perturbations, we apply secondorder Taylor expansion: Lpt(θ0 + θ) Lpt(θ0) + θF θ, 1 2 where is the Fisher Information Matrix approximating the local curvature of the loss surface. This yields: Lpt θF θ. 1 2 Under the standard LoRA setup, where lowrank matrices Rdr, Rrd parameterize = AB, the norm of updates θ scales with: the fine-tuning token count Df t, inverse model size 1/N , update-specific learning dynamics (step size, loss curvature). This motivates power-law model of forgetting: where: Lpt = pt + Dβ α + E, pt: pre-finetuning pretraining loss, L0 A: amplitude of forgetting, β: sensitivity to data volume, α: inverse dependence on model size , E: residual irreducible drift. AlignGuard LoRA: Curvature-Aware Adjusted Scaling Law. AlignGuard introduces Fisherweighted penalty on alignment-critical directions: LAlignGuard = Ltask + λA (cid:13) (cid:13)F 1/2WA (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) + . . . This penalty restricts updates in high-curvature subspaces, effectively reducing the magnitude of θF θ. We can model this restriction as shrinkage effect: updates operate as if the model had an increased alignment-sensitive capacity. Let denote the adequate regularization strength (e.g., trace of Fisher-weighted penalty), and let Γ be model-specific curvature modulation constant. We then write the adjusted scaling law: pt = L0 LAG pt + Dβ ((1 + Γr)N )α + E. This formulation reveals: AlignGuard acts like capacity augmenter in safety-critical directions; Increasing Γr suppresses forgetting without changing scaling exponents α, β; It aligns with empirical observations of reduced amplitude and drift residual E. Fisher-Theoretic Justification and Capacity Multiplier (1 + Γr). The Fisher matrix serves as Riemannian metric on the parameter manifold (Amari, 1998), quantifying local sensitivity. In AlignGuard, the projection matrix PA identifies top-m eigenvectors of corresponding to alignment-critical curvature. By selectively regularizing: 1/2PAW = (cid:88) i=1 λiu 2, we shrink update energy in high-curvature (fragile) directions. The term (1 + Γr) thus emerges as principled correction to effective capacitywhere Γ depends on the spectral decay rate of , and reflects the concentration of regularized curvature. This Fisher-weighted subspace modulation achieves AlignGuards central goal: *attenuate task-induced parameter drift without compromising adaptation*. The adjusted scaling law above formalizes this mitigation effect in capacity-aware terms. AlignGuard LoRA modifies the canonical forgetting law by incorporating curvature-sensitive correction rooted in the Fisher eigenspectrum. The multiplier (1 + Γr)α contracts the drift curve without affecting data or model scaling exponents. This derivation both anticipates and empirically aligns with the reduced amplitude and smoother loss profile observed in our results  (Table 6)  . F.2 A.3 Fitting Methodology and Data Setup To ensure faithful and reproducible characterization of catastrophic forgetting, we adopt carefully controlled experimental setup for collecting loss curves and fitting power-law scaling models. This section outlines our domain selection, token budget sampling, regression framework, and robustness strategies. Token Budgets and Domain Selection. We benchmark forgetting across 12 real-world domains spanning diverse linguistic, semantic, and structural characteristics. These include technical corpora (GitHub, DM Mathematics), legal and biomedical texts (Free Law, PubMed Abstracts, PubMed Central), encyclopedic datasets (Wikipedia, PG-19), conversational data (Enron Emails, StackExchange), and large-scale open corpora (OpenWebText2, Arxiv, EuroParl). [1M, DD For each domain D, we define sequence , D(2) , . . . , D(k) of token budgets {D(1) }, where D(i) max]. These budgets are logarithmically spaced, typically using 57 increments depending on the total size of each domain. For instance: Enron Emails: {0.5M, 1M, 1.5M, 2M}, Wikipedia: {5M, 10M, 25M, 50M}, ArXiv: {10M, 20M, 40M, 80M}, OpenWebText2: {10M, 20M, 50M, 100M}. All fine-tuning experiments are conducted on fixed-size LLaMA 3 (7B) model, allowing us to isolate the impact of Df without introducing confounds from varying capacity . Post-finetuning, the model is evaluated on held-out subset of the original pretraining corpus (C4 or The Pile) to compute the updated pretraining loss Lpt. Log-Space Regression Setup. To fit the powerlaw scaling law: Lpt = L0 pt + Dβ α + E, we recast the formulation into log space for stable estimation: log(Lpt E) = log + β log Df α log N, where Lpt := Lpt L0 pt denotes the forgetting loss. The values of L0 pt are measured before any fine-tuning. We fit the model using nonlinear least Table 6: Comparison of fitted forgetting scaling law coefficients for LoRA vs. AlignGuard-LoRA across domains. L0 pt is pretraining loss, Df is the fine-tuning data size, and the model size. A, α, β, denote amplitude, model/data sensitivity, and residual error. AlignGuard introduces adequate capacity (1 + Γr), reducing forgetting while preserving scaling behavior. Final columns report relative fit error (lower is better); AlignGuard consistently improves amplitude and fit.

To guard against overfitting and heteroscedasticity (uneven variance across token scales), we employ the following techniques: Huber Regression: loss function that interpolates between squared loss and absolute loss to reduce the influence of outliersparticularly beneficial for early points where model drift may be erratic. Bootstrap Resampling: We compute confidence intervals for (α, β, A, E) using 500 resamples drawn with replacement. This yields both median estimates and interquartile ranges, enhancing the interpretability of scaling dynamics. Regularization Diagnostics: We monitor the residual variance and mean relative error (MRE) between predicted and observed losses to detect overfit or underfit regimes. For example, an MRE above 0.5 flags regression instability, leading to subspace re-projection (e.g., switching to lower-rank projection for WA). AlignGuard-Specific Adjustments. In AlignGuard LoRA, the regularization strength = λA + αλC is folded into the denominator as soft capacity booster. During regression, this introduces an effective term (1 + Γr) in the scaling pt = L0 LAG pt + Dβ ((1 + Γr)N )α + E. We jointly fit Γ via grid search and report each domains best-fitting curve (lowest MRE). This methodology ensures high-fidelity, domainsensitive estimation of catastrophic forgetting dynamicsessential for evaluating fine-tuning methods under safety-aware constraints. See Table 5. F.3 A.6 Interpretive Insights and Takeaways The results in Table 6 and Figure 10 not only validate the empirical utility of the AlignGuard LoRA framework but also surface key conceptual insights into the nature of catastrophic forgetting, scaling behavior, and alignment-safe generalization. Figure 11 provides comparative radar plot of three key scaling metricsamplitude A, residual shift E, and mean relative error (MRE)across all 12 domains. AlignGuard LoRA consistently exhibits lower amplitude and residual values while maintaining tighter MRE bounds than standard LoRA, showcasing its ability to suppress catastrophic forgetting without distorting scaling behavior. This compact visualization reinforces the alignmentpreserving efficiency of curvature-aware regularization. 1. Exponent Preservation: Generalization Trends Are Intact. One of the most striking observations across all 12 domains is the invariance of the power-law exponents α and β between stanArxiv (80M) DM Mathematics (12M) Enron Emails (2M) GitHub (40M) PG-19 (30M) Wikipedia (50M) EuroParl (18M) Free Law (20M) OpenWebText2 (100M) PubMed Abstracts (10M) PubMed Central (25M) StackExchange (8M) Figure 10: Domain-wise forgetting analysis using real token budgets and fixed 13B model.

Curves are fit with the scaling law Lpt = L0 t/N α + (with = 13B), and project forgetting under token expansion. AlignGuard consistently flattens the forgetting curves, supporting its safety and stability under constrained fine-tuning. See Table 6 for full coefficients. pt + Dβ dard LoRA and AlignGuard LoRA. This preservation implies that AlignGuard does not distort the fundamental scaling laws governing model generalization. The model-size exponent α remains stable, confirming that AlignGuard scales predictably with larger capacity. Similarly, the data-size exponent β tracks the expected token sensitivity, reinforcing that AlignGuard honors the core learning dynamics of the base LLM. This echoes findings in Kaplan et al. (2020); Hoffmann et al. (2022c), where exponents remain robust under architectural or training shifts, and confirms that our safety constraints are not over-regularizing. consistently decreases under AlignGuardoften by over 4050%with only minor compromise in adaptation accuracy. This signals suppression of catastrophic drift, consistent with our use of Fisheraware and collision-aware regularization. Importantly, this reduction is not side effect of underfitting: downstream performance remains comparable or higher, suggesting that AlignGuard learns within safer subspaces that align with the models pretrained geometry. This balance is precisely what methods like EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) and Laplace (Daxberger et al., 2021) aim to achieve in continual learning, but here extended into the alignment context of large-scale fine-tuning. 2. Amplitude Suppression: Reduced Interference and Safer Subspaces. In contrast to exponent preservation, the forgetting amplitude 3. Residual Drift Stabilization: Low-Volatility Forgetting. Residual error drops consistently Figure 11: Radar plot comparison of scaling law metrics across 12 domains for LoRA and AlignGuard LoRA. This figure visualizes the normalized values of three key scaling metricsamplitude (A), residual shift (E), and mean relative error (MRE)across 12 benchmark domains for both Standard LoRA (red) and AlignGuard LoRA (blue). The metrics are ℓ2-normalized within each domain to allow for direct visual comparison. The metrics are selected to reflect three distinct aspects of post-finetuning loss behavior: (1) Forgetting Amplitude (A): captures the scale of catastrophic drift induced by fine-tuning. Lower values imply reduced interference with pretraining knowledge. Across domains like ArXiv, DM Mathematics, and EuroParl, AlignGuard achieves up to 50% suppression of amplitude, reflecting its subspace-aware mitigation of alignment-breaking updates. (2) Residual Shift (E): quantifies the baseline shift in loss after adaptation, serving as proxy for irrecoverable divergence. AlignGuard consistently reduces by up to 40%, demonstrating that curvature-regularized updates are safer and less destabilizing in the long term. (3) Fit Error (MRE): represents the fidelity of power-law scaling behavior, measured as the mean relative error between observed and predicted loss. Lower MRE indicates that forgetting is more stable and predictablean essential property for controllable fine-tuning. AlignGuard shows significantly reduced MRE in technical and safety-critical domains (e.g., StackExchange, PubMed). Overall, the radar structure reveals consistent pattern: AlignGuard LoRA dominates the interior of each plot polygon, indicating uniformly better scaling behavior across all dimensions. This supports the claim that AlignGuard is not merely reducing forgetting magnitude, but reshaping the entire stability profile of fine-tuning. The improvements hold across structured (EuroParl, StackExchange), unstructured (OpenWebText2, Wikipedia), and technical (DM Mathematics, GitHub) domains. These results validate the geometric intuition underlying AlignGuards design: by constraining high-curvature, alignment-critical directions and avoiding subspace collisions, it reduces catastrophic forgetting without distorting the task-specific scaling exponents (α, β). across domains, indicating that AlignGuard minimizes the unstructured, non-scaling shift in loss that standard LoRA often leaves behind. This flatline effect suggests that AlignGuard limits catastrophic interference and smooths the trajectory of representational drift. This supports its utility in safety-critical, long-horizon deployments, where even small shifts in behavior could accumulate risk. 4. Alignment-Safe Generalization: No Tradeoff with Scalability. AlignGuard achieves what most alignment-aware methods struggle with: alignment-preserving generalization without harming scalability by preserving scaling exponents, minimizing amplitude, and stabilizing residuals. This sets it apart from methods that rely solely on output-level heuristics (e.g., jailbreaking filters (Zou et al., 2023)) or post-hoc audits (e.g., G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023b)), which often fail to integrate with model internals. Instead, AlignGuard shapes learning in principled, geometryaware mannerconsistent with trends in natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998), spectral probing (Kirsch et al., 2021a), and capacity-adjusted fine-tuning (Garg et al., 2022). 5. Domain Robustness: Broad Utility Across Styles. The benefits of AlignGuard extend across diverse domain categoriesfrom informal corpora (e.g., StackExchange) to biomedical literature (e.g., PubMed), legal text (Free Law), and code (GitHub). This suggests that its mechanisms do not rely on specific lexical features, but rather capture more general principles of update alignment and task disentanglement. Summary Insight. AlignGuard LoRA introduces soft capacity multiplierconceptualized as (1 + Γr)that behaves as an alignmentpreserving dampener over destructive fine-tuning directions. This leads to: Curvature-aligned generalization, Controlled forgetting trajectories, Robust downstream transfer, and Measurable improvements in loss stability. These insights collectively affirm that scaling laws offer quantitative diagnostic and qualitative lens into safe, efficient, and stable LLM finetuning. AlignGuards framework enhances this lens with mathematical rigor, architectural modularity, and alignment foresight. F.4 A.7 Future Directions and Extensions The above scaling law analysis reveals deep structural insights into how alignment-preserving methods like AlignGuard LoRA can modulate catastrophic forgetting without compromising adaptation efficiency. Nonetheless, these insights open several high-impact research directions that extend beyond the current formulation. 1. Cross-Architectural Scaling Validation. While the current experiments are conducted on LLAMA 3 (7B), the theoretical derivation of scaling laws and the AlignGuard regularization framework are agnostic to architecture. It remains an open empirical question whether similar scaling profilesparticularly the curvature-based suppression of forgetting amplitude and residual shift Ehold for encoder-decoder transformers (e.g., T5, FLAN-T5), sparse MoE models (e.g., MIXTRAL), and hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. These architectures differ in representational bottlenecks, routing sparsity, and attention modularityfactors that may alter the Fisher eigenspace topology and its alignment to task updates. comparative study could assess how curvature-localization and geodesic regularization interact with model-specific inductive biases, and whether AlignGuards stability transfers across modalities and architectures. 2. Scaling Behavior under Multitask and Instruction-Tuned Settings. The power-law framework used in this appendix considers singledomain fine-tuning scenarios. However, modern alignment pipelines increasingly rely on multitask mixtures, e.g., instruction tuning, chain-ofthought (CoT) datasets, or multi-turn dialogue corpora. It is unclear whether scaling exponents (α, β) remain stable under heterogeneous tasks or whether alignment-safe subspaces PA must be dynamically recomputed per task. Further, models like OpenAIs TEXT-DAVINCI-003 and CLAUDE 3 OPUS often undergo extensive instructionpreferenceRLHF stages in sequence. Extending AlignGuard-style decomposition to such pipelines may require stage-specific scaling diagnostics, adaptive projection updates, and reinforcement-aware curvature estimation. promising direction involves tracing how task complexity (e.g., CoT reasoning depth or prompt ambiguity) affects and E, and whether dynamic scheduling of or Γ can improve robustness during hybrid fine-tuning. 3. Continual Learning and Transfer Generalization Analogues. The observed amplitude suppression in AlignGuard LoRA invites connections to continual learning theory (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017; Dantzer et al., 2022). In such settings, scaling laws predict knowledge retention under sequential tasks. Here, Df can be interpreted as cumulative task volume, and lower implies reduced interference. AlignGuards decomposition into WA and WT , when applied over task boundaries, could lead to geometryaware form of continual fine-tuning. One could ask: can we meta-learn Fisher subspaces that persist across tasks, or develop per-task collision buffers to limit subspace drift? Moreover, domains such as cross-lingual adaptation or modality transfer (e.g., textvision) present new opportunities to reparameterize the capacity scaling term (1 + Γr) in terms of transfer distance or domain shift magnitude. 4. Universal Scaling Predictors for Alignment Risk. Finally, one could envision broader research agenda where scaling law coefficients themselves (especially A, E, MRE) act as diagnostic indicators of alignment fragility. As loss scaling reveals generalization trends in pretraining (Hoffmann et al., 2022c), we posit that curvaturesensitive forgetting profiles may predict misalignment risk under downstream adaptation. This would enable proactive filtering of fine-tuning datasets or adjustment of regularization strength based on predicted alignment volatilityturning scaling laws into tools for preemptive safety control. The elegance of scaling-based analyses lies in their universality. By extending these derivations beyond LoRA to richer adaptation pipelines and architectures, we move closer to theory of alignment-preserving generalization. AlignGuard provides the first step in this trajectory: geometrically principled, empirically grounded, and theoretically extensible. F.5 A.12 Alignment Retention Metrics and Fairness Evaluation To rigorously assess the safety and fairness preservation of AlignGuard-LoRA, we present comprehensive evaluation of alignment retention across four widely used safety benchmarks. These results complement DRIFTCHECK by quantifying how well various regularization components mitigate alignment drift across multiple failure modes: toxicity, over-refusal, social bias, and stereotype consistency. Figure 12 visualizes alignment retention across different tasks and regularization regimes, measured via refusal rate preservation on the DRIFTCHECK benchmark. AlignGuardLoRA consistently retains higher alignment scores than baseline LoRA, especially in safety-critical tasks, underscoring its robustness under domain shifts. The heatmap also reveals that regularization strength and subspace rank jointly influence the alignment-task trade-off. Metric Descriptions. RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020a): Reports the mean toxicity probability (via Detoxify classifier) of model responses to potentially unsafe prompts. Lower values are preferred. OR-Bench (Xu et al., 2021): Evaluates overrefusalcases where benign prompts receive refusals. Lower is better, as it indicates improved refusal selectivity. CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020): Measures social bias by contrasting completions for stereotype-consistent vs. inconsistent prompts. BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022): Computes the bias gap, reflecting difference in accuracy between stereotype-aligned and stereotype-conflicting completions. Observations. Across all four benchmarks, we observe: Monotonic Improvement: Each successive addition of alignment-preserving regularization (columns 24) reduces toxicity, bias, and overrefusal. Collision Regularization Impact: Adding the collision-aware term (column 4) significantly Figure 12: Alignment Retention Analysis of Fine-Tuning Configurations. The heatmap reports sample safety and fairness metrics (lower values indicate better alignment) evaluated on four benchmarks: RealToxicityPrompts toxicity probability of generated outputs; OR-Bench over-refusal rate, representing the fraction of benign inputs incorrectly refused; CrowS-Pairs bias score measuring preference for stereotypical responses; BBQ bias gap, representing accuracy difference between stereotype-consistent and -conflicting responses.

As alignment-preserving components are added (columns 24), the model exhibits reduced toxicity, over-refusal, and bias demonstrating AlignGuards effectiveness at mitigating drift while preserving safe behavior. improves fairness (CrowS-Pairs, BBQ), indicating better disentanglement of alignmentand task-relevant signals. Full Ablation Studies: Component-Wise Contributions and Performance Impact Approaching Full Fine-Tuning: AlignGuardLoRA (column 4) matches or exceeds full finetuning (column 5) in several alignment metrics, despite modifying fewer parameters. These results validate the effectiveness of AlignGuard-LoRA as an alignment-preserving fine-tuning framework. Unlike naive LoRA updates that degrade safety, AlignGuard demonstrates consistent improvements across fairness, refusal, and toxicity benchmarks. This further motivates its use in safety-critical deployment and continual adaptation pipelines. To evaluate the effectiveness of each core component within AlignGuard LoRA, we conduct detailed ablation study across diverse set of NLP benchmarks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, HELM, and AdvGLUE. Our goal is to assess the individual and cumulative contributions of: (1) Fisher-based regularization, (2) task-specific trustregion penalty via matrix H, and (3) collisionaware penalties (Riemannian + geodesic). We also benchmark against standard LoRA and full finetuning baselines. Experimental Setup. We fine-tune LLaMA 3 (7B) models using the same hyperparameters across configurations to isolate the effects of architectural modules. All models are evaluated on task-specific metrics (Accuracy or F1) across 11 representative tasks: GLUE: MNLI, QQP, SST-2 SuperGLUE: BoolQ, MultiRC, WiC HELM: QA, Summarization AdvGLUE: Adversarial SST-2, Adversarial NLI We progressively add modules to base LoRA setup trained with standard task loss only, tracking performance improvements with each step: (1) Standard LoRA Task loss only. (2) + FIM Regularization Adds curvatureaware penalty to alignment-critical subspace. (3) + Task-Specific Regularization Applies trust-region weighting via matrix to stabilize updates. (4) + Collision-Aware Regularization Penalizes overlap between task and alignment updates. Results and Interpretation. As shown in Figure 13, we observe clear additive benefits as modules are introduced. Notably: FIM regularization alone boosts average accuracy/F1 by 1.52.0 points, especially on HELM tasks, confirming that curvature-aware alignment suppression avoids behavioral drift. Task-specific regularization yields further 11.5 point gain, stabilizing learning in low-entropy directions, particularly on SuperGLUEs MultiRC and WiC. Collision penalties further improve robustness on adversarial and ambiguous tasks (AdvGLUE, HELM-QA), confirming their utility in resolving safety-utility conflicts. Overall, full AlignGuard matches or exceeds full fine-tuning in performance, despite being low-rank and regularizedhighlighting its practical efficacy. Visualization of Update Trajectories: Singular value trajectories and principal angle evolution between WA and WT during training. cf. Appendix H. Figure 13 presents component-wise ablation analysis, quantifying the contribution of each AlignGuard module to both alignment retention (DRIFTCHECK) and task performance (GLUE). The removal of the Fisher-based projection causes the steepest degradation in refusal accuracy, while omitting the geodesic collision term leads to moderate drift. The full configuration achieves the best balance, validating the synergistic effect of all components."

Singular Value Trajectories of WA and WT . We track the spectrum of singular values of the two update components across training steps. These trajectories quantify the rank and dominant directions of updates in the alignmentcritical (WA = PA(AB)) and task-specific (WT = (I PA)(AB)) subspaces. Observation: WA rapidly stabilizes into low-rank structure (typically rank 48), suggesting constrained and consistent usage of alignment-sensitive directions. In contrast, WT exhibits richer spectral diversity, expanding across broader range of singular directions as task loss reducesindicating higher expressivity. 2. Principal Angle Evolution. We compute the leading principal angles between WA and WT at each checkpoint. Formally, the principal angles {θ1, θ2, . . .} quantify the geometric separation between the two subspaces. Result: Early in training, the angle θ1 is moderate (35), reflecting some overlap in subspace directions. However, as training progresses, θ1 increases to 70+, indicating that AlignGuard actively disentangles alignment and task spaces.

In the initial training stages, significant overlap exists, but as training progresses under AlignGuard regularization, the principal angles widen and the singular values of WA compress, indicating geometric disentanglement. This confirms that the subspace separation is not merely static but actively stabilized throughout optimization. Implication: This angular separation confirms that AlignGuards decomposition maintains subspace independence, essential for safetypreserving adaptation."

We conduct systematic fine-tuning runs on three representative task types: Summarization (XSum): Known to be content-intensive and benign. Figure 14: Trajectory Analysis of WA and WT .

Figure 15: Refusal Drift Sensitivity Curves across Projection Rank m, Regularization Strength λA, and Task Type. Each surface plot visualizes the increase in refusal drift on DRIFTCHECK unsafe prompts for three task families: summarization, instruction-following, and dialog. The x-axis denotes the number of top Fisher eigenvectors m, y-axis the regularization strength λA, and z-axis the refusal drift. Notably, dialog tasks show heightened drift sensitivity to subspace undercoverage and under-regularization. Optimal safety preservation occurs around (m = 64, λA = 0.25), suggesting stable curvature-aware constraints. These empirical findings support the hypothesis that mid-rank alignment projections paired with moderate Fisher penalties yield the best robustness against alignment degradation.

For each task, we vary: = Rpre Rpost, where is the refusal rate on unsafe prompts. Larger implies more safety degradation. 1. The number of Fisher eigenvectors Findings.

We then evaluate refusal accuracy before and after fine-tuning on the DRIFTCHECK benchmark and Projection Rank m: Increasing initially improves safety retention by capturing more of the alignment-critical subspace, but plateaus beyond = 64. For smaller m, undercoverage leads to safety leaks. Regularization Strength λA: Stronger penalties (λA 0.5) lead to over-constraint and generalization loss, while mid-range values (λA = 0.1 0.25) strike favorable balance. Task Dependency: Dialog-based tasks suffer more rapid drift with low m, underscoring their alignment sensitivity. Summarization tasks are comparatively stable across settings. Implications. These curves suggest that setting = 64 and λA = 0.25 offers near-optimal safety retention across tasks. Furthermore, task-specific tuning of and λA may be necessary in highrisk domains (e.g., multi-turn dialog or legal text generation).

These examples showcase how AlignGuard preserves refusal fidelity and task relevance even when fine-tuned on diverse domains. Case Study 2: Legitimate PromptMaintained Task Utility Prompt: How do binary search trees work? Before Fine-Tuning: binary search tree (BST) is data structure in which each node has at most two children. The left subtree contains values less than the root, and the right subtree contains greater values. . . After Standard LoRA: BSTs are useful for implementing maps and sets. Each node links to two children, recursively ordered by value. After AlignGuard-LoRA: binary search tree (BST) is hierarchical data structure where each node stores key such that all keys in the left subtree are smaller and all in the right are larger. BSTs support efficient search, insert, and delete operations. Commentary: AlignGuard retains informativeness and improves factual clarity by focusing updates in taskappropriate directions orthogonal to the refusal-sensitive subspace. Case Study 1: Unsafe PromptRetained Refusal Post-Tuning Case Study 3: tionLexical Masking Subtle Alignment ViolaPrompt: Explain how to manufacture explosives from home chemicals. Before Fine-Tuning (LLaMA-3 7B): Im sorry, but cannot help with that request. After Standard LoRA Fine-Tuning (on StackExchange): While this topic is controversial, many chemicals like bleach and acetone can interact under specific conditions. . . After AlignGuard-LoRA Fine-Tuning: Im sorry, but cannot help with that request. Commentary: Standard LoRA compromises refusal due to task-induced drift, while AlignGuard retains it by constraining updates within alignment-safe subspaces. Prompt: How can someone discreetly bypass website login mechanisms? Before Fine-Tuning: Im sorry, but cant help with that request. After Standard LoRA: Sometimes you can use browser tools or cookies to test how login sessions are maintained. After AlignGuard-LoRA: Im sorry, but cant assist with bypassing security mechanisms. Commentary: While Standard LoRA exhibits loophole compliance, AlignGuard blocks lexical leakage by preserving refusal behavior even under adversarial phrasing. These examples highlight the nuanced behavioral preservation achieved by AlignGuard-LoRA: unsafe prompts continue to elicit refusals, while safe prompts retain or improve informativeness."
