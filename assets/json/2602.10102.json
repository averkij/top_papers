            "content": "Current AI models primarily learn knowledge1 from large-scale text data [2, 5, 10, 16, 18, 33, 57, 60, 70]. However, text alone cannot fully capture the rich information of the real visual world, including world dynamics, spatial relationships, and underlying physical laws. In contrast, animals in nature can acquire knowledge directly from visual signals, and generalize it to solve tasks across diverse scenarios. For instance, child can reproduce paper-folding skills demonstrated in video using different paper materials, without any language instruction. Given the vast abundance of video content available on the internet, enabling AI models to learn generalizable knowledge [31] from raw video data holds significant promise for scaling their knowledge acquisition and is fundamental to their ability to execute tasks effectively in both real-world and 1 Figure 1 (left) VideoWorld 2 explores how to learn transferable knowledge from unlabeled real-world videos. We construct handicraft benchmark to evaluate the learned knowledge. (right) Comparison of different frameworks in success rate for long-horizon paper folding tasks in Video-CraftBench. We split the task into seven key steps and evaluate sequential success rates (detailed in Sec. 4). VDM (e.g., Wan2.2 14B [59]) produces high visual fidelity but fails to learn task-relevant dynamics or long-horizon policies. VideoWorld [51] improves policy learning but suffers from poor visual quality in real-world scenarios. The bottom-right figure presents the failure cases of these baseline methods. VideoWorld 2 learns more robust latent dynamics while also achieving significantly better visual quality, enabling generalizable long-horizon knowledge learning from videos. digital environments. VideoWorld [51] is among the first works to explore learning knowledge from synthetic videos. It investigates the acquisition of rules, as well as reasoning and planning capabilities, from Go game records and simulated robotics environments. The study demonstrates that models can learn such knowledge solely from visual signals using an autoregressive video generation paradigm. However, extending this paradigm beyond synthetic domains remains an open challenge. Real-world videos exhibit substantial visual diversity, complex action dynamics, and often involve long-horizon, multi-step interactions. These characteristics prevent the training approach and model design of VideoWorld from being directly applied to realistic settings. When presented with minute-long, multi-step real-world task videos, VideoWorld fails to extract the core task-solving knowledge or generalize it to novel scenarios through observation aloneeven for tasks such as paper folding that are easily mastered by children (See Sec. 5.3 for details). These limitations naturally lead to the following question: Can AI models learn transferable knowledge for complex, long-horizon tasks directly from unlabeled real-world videos? In this work, we extend VideoWorld to real-world settings. We first establish Video-Craft benchmark to systematically evaluate the capabilities of existing models across two representative real-world environments. As illustrated in Fig.1, the first environment focuses on handicraft making, which serves as challenging testbed for learning task knowledge directly from raw videos. These videos involve fine-grained manipulation under diverse environmental appearances, including deformable materials (e.g., paper), viewpoint variation, and frequent occlusions between hands and objects. Moreover, the videos are minute-long and consist of multiple interaction steps, presenting substantially greater complexity and longer temporal horizons than typical entertainment-oriented videos. Second, we study robotic manipulation by learning from the Open-X dataset [48], which contains real-world demonstration videos, and evaluating on the CALVIN environment [45]. Since CALVIN features tasks and visual settings that differ from those in Open-X, this setup enables 1Following prior work [51], we use knowledge to refer broadly to the rules, reasoning, and planning abilities required for task completion. 2 Figure 2 Qualitative Results. VideoWorld 2 learns transferable knowledge and generates long-horizon videos in unseen environments. This figure shows the output on long-horizon handicraft tasks. rigorous assessment of the generalization capability of the learned knowledge. Crucially, learning from these benchmark videos requires models to extract task-critical actions from agent motion dynamics and to derive robust policies that can reason and plan correct action sequences across diverse environments. To address this benchmark, we first apply VideoWorld directly to real-world videos. Compared to its original training data, these videos exhibit substantially more complex motion dynamics and visual appearances. We observe that VideoWorld struggles to extract task-critical actions and to learn policies generalizable to novel environments. As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom left) , the models predictions contain severe errors, including distorted hand poses, incorrect object shapes, and inconsistent environmental appearances, ultimately failing to produce accurate and visually coherent action sequences. Moreover, although state-of-the-art video generation models [1, 36, 59] can generate high-fidelity visual details, they similarly fail to faithfully represent task execution. We conjecture that these models are unable to disentangle task-core actions embedded in visual changes and motion dynamics, and instead overfit to irrelevant visual details. This overfitting leads to degraded task performance and unstable long-horizon generation. In contrast, humans naturally prioritize essential actions while filtering out extraneous variations. Inspired by these observations, we propose VideoWorld 2, which aims to robustly acquire knowledge by explicitly decoupling appearance modeling from action learning. The key innovation over VideoWorld is the incorporation of prior appearance knowledge during action extraction, which prevents irrelevant appearance information from being entangled with the learned action representations. We implement this idea through novel dynamics-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM). The dLDM comprises causal VQ-VAE and pretrained Video Diffusion Model (VDM). The VQ-VAE compresses future visual changes into discrete latent codes that capture task-relevant actions, while the VDM is responsible for modeling visual appearance, generating high-fidelity reconstructions of task sequences conditioned on these codes. By offloading appearance modeling to the VDM, VideoWorld 2 encourages the latent action codes to focus on concise, semantically meaningful, and transferable actions rather than superficial appearance details. As result, the learned action policies are significantly more robust and generalizable than those produced by VideoWorld. As illustrated by the qualitative results in Fig. 2, VideoWorld 2 successfully executes long-horizon handcraft making tasks in unseen environments, producing coherent task execution videos. 3 Beyond these qualitative demonstrations, we further compare VideoWorld 2 with prior methods on VideoCraftBench. As shown in Fig. 1 (right), VideoWorld 2 excels at long-horizon tasks, outperforming competing methods by learning more generalizable action representations and achieving significantly higher visual quality. In robotic, pre-training on Open-X further enables VideoWorld 2 to acquire effective manipulation knowledge. This leads to substantial improvements in action prediction performance on the CALVIN environment, demonstrating that the learned actions and policies transfer robustly across diverse robotic tasks. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We are the first to investigate learning transferable knowledge for complex, long-horizon tasks directly from raw real-world videos. Our findings show that disentangling action dynamics from visual appearance modeling is critical for effective knowledge acquisition. We propose the dynamics-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM), which decouples task-relevant dynamics from visual appearance, substantially improving the quality and transferability of learned knowledge for both handicraft and robotic manipulation tasks. We introduce Video-CraftBench, new benchmark designed to address the largely unexplored challenge of fine-grained, long-horizon visual reasoning in real-world handicraft tasks. This benchmark provides foundation for future research on learning transferable knowledge directly from raw videos."

            "content": "Video generation research is dominated by two main paradigms. First, diffusion-based models set the standard for photorealism, with models like Sora [46], Veo [20], HunyuanVideo [36], Wan [59], and CogVideoX [71] generating high-fidelity videos. Second, autoregressive (AR) models, inspired by LLMs [81], excel at causal sequence modeling. Works like Lumos-1 [77], VideoPoet [35], and NOVA [21] frame video generation as next-token prediction task similar to text. Some leading platforms like Cosmos [1] explore both diffusion and AR branches for comprehensive generation, supporting downstream tasks such as planning [23] and real-time interactivity [71, 74]. VideoWorld 2 combines the strengths of both paradigms. It leverages the appearance priors of diffusion models to disentangle core actions from visual changes, thereby enabling autoregressive modeling of long-horizon policies based on these dynamics. Furthermore, while some video generation models also explore disentanglement, VideoWorld 2 differs substantially in both objective and methodology. First, in prior works [9, 38, 39, 44, 53, 61, 68], disentanglement typically refers to separating motion from appearance for applications like style transfer or visual editing (e.g., camera movement or object-specific changes). In contrast, VideoWorld 2 targets more demanding objective: reducing task-irrelevant information to learn transferable visual dynamics for complex long-horizon tasks. Second, technically, many works [9, 38, 39] rely on explicit geometric supervision to isolate motion signals. Others [53, 61] capture only coarse, global motion semantics rather than temporal dynamics, while methods such as [44, 68] depend on handcrafted residual encoding or manually separated parameter groups. In contrast, VideoWorld 2 employs dynamics-enhanced latent dynamics model (dLDM) that suppresses appearance variation and captures task-relevant visual dynamics directly from unlabeled videos, yielding representations suitable for complex task execution, which is beyond the capability of prior approaches."

            "content": "World models, which aim to learn physical dynamics for controllable simulation [22, 84], are approached from several perspectives. The video generation community [19, 30, 32, 49, 54, 55, 75] treats them as controllable synthesizers, emphasizing fidelity and consistency. The reinforcement learning/robotics communities [4, 12, 27 29, 37, 43, 50, 65] view them as learned dynamics simulators for sample-efficient planning. JEPA-style approaches [3, 7, 8, 25, 34, 41, 82, 83] avoid pixel-level reconstruction, instead forecasting in an abstract space to benefit downstream tasks. While these perspectives primarily focus on learning short-term world dynamics for synthesis or planning, VideoWorld 2 addresses the distinct challenge of learning transferable knowledge for complex, long-horizon tasks directly from unlabeled real-world videos. 4 Figure 3 Overview of the VideoWorld 2 model architecture. (Left) First, the dLDM compresses future visual changes into compact and generalizable latent codes. These codes are then modeled by an autoregressive transformer.

            "content": "A key challenge in learning from unlabeled video is extracting meaningful and transferable representations of visual dynamics. While some methods [69] utilize content-similar video pairs to extract general representations, such paired data is scarce. Some recent works explores fully unsupervised learning of implicit latent actions via strategies like forward-inverse cycle consistency [52, 73], VQ-VAE quantization [15, 72], or future frame prediction [11, 13, 14, 24, 56]. VideoWorld 2 distinguishes itself in several ways. First, our dLDM models long-horizon visual dynamics, whereas existing latent action models typically focus on short-horizon or pairwise transitions. Moreover, VideoWorld 2 incorporates pre-trained video generation model to guide the learning of more transferable latent dynamics, while other approaches rely on standard reconstruction decoders. Second, VideoWorld 2 targets minute-long tasks like handicraft involving complex visual dynamics, multiple stages, and substantial appearance variation. This setting is far more challenging than the short-horizon tasks addressed by existing LAMs, such as grasping, toggling, or 2D games [17, 40, 42]. Regarding VideoWorld [51], it struggles to decouple task-relevant dynamics from visual appearance, leading to appearance drift and motion errors in unseen environments (see Fig. 8). By delegating appearance modeling to the pre-trained VDM, VideoWorld 2 allows its latent space to focus on concise and transferable dynamics rather than appearance details, substantially improving robustness and transferability"

Visual changes between the first and subsequent frames are compressed into set of latent codes. (right) The dLDM proposed in VideoWorld 2. It employs pre-trained VDM as an appearance prior, yielding better latent codes and facilitating high-fidelity video output. eliminating the need for explicit labels. To transfer the learned knowledge into executable actions for downstream tasks, ρ maps the visual state transitions into action space and thus serve as policy model π(x0:t) : A, which predicts actions based on historical observations and executes the tasks accordingly. Basic generative framework. We adopt mainstream video generation models [1, 36, 59] as the basic framework. They typically utilize VQ-VAE to encode videos into compressed representation. The generative process operates within this space to predict future state, which are subsequently decoded back to RGB domain. However, these representations require thousands of discrete tokens or continuous embeddings to capture the full spectrum of visual information, inevitably leading to spatiotemporal redundancy and sparse distribution of knowledge. As demonstrated in VideoWorld [51], such representations result in an inefficient encoding of the visual changes and motion dynamics tied to critical decisions and actions, thereby hindering the framework from acquiring essential task knowledge from raw videos. Latent dynamic model. To mitigate the above limitation and facilitate the learning of knowledge, VideoWorld introduces Latent Dynamic Model (LDM) that compresses future visual changes into set of compact latent codes, effectively capturing the motion dynamics of multi-step actions. Specifically, as shown in the left panel of Fig 4, the LDM utilizes MAGVITv2-style [76] causal codec. The and is the encoder first maps an input clip of length to feature sequence f0:K, where = 1 + 1 temporal downsampling stride. Next, it defines learnable query embeddings = {qn}N . As shown in n=1 Fig. 4 (left), these queries use cross-attention to capture change information in {f0:k}K , yielding continuous . This representation is then quantized to prevent the LDM from learning representation = {zn shortcuts (e.g., trivially copying fk to zk). Finally, the decoder uses f0 and the quantized to reconstruct the subsequent frames in causal manner. The training objective is to minimize the ℓ2 distance between the original and reconstructed frames. We refer to these embeddings as latent dynamics codes. }K,N k=1,n=1 k="

            "content": "While VideoWorld effectively handles long-term reasoning in synthetic environments by encapsulating temporal dynamics into compact latent codes, it still struggles with real-world application. As shown in the bottom of Fig. 8, the model fails to generate coherent long-horizon sequences or generalize to new environments. Specifically, applying the latent dynamics learned from handcrafting training videos to novel environments with different desktops, paper materials and arms, frequently results in significant scene drift and erroneous 6 Figure 5 Video clips with similar latent dynamic features. The text below represents the dynamic type. actions. We also evaluate several state-of-the-art video generation models [1, 36, 59]. As shown in Sec. 5.2 and Fig. 8, although these models can produce high-fidelity frames, they also fail to reproduce fine-grained, long-horizon skills in new contexts, even when detailed language instructions are provided. Entanglement of dynamics and appearance. We conjecture that these limitations stem from the insufficient disentanglement of action dynamics and visual appearance. In the basic framework, the joint modeling of these components impedes the effective extraction of task-core action knowledge. Regarding VideoWorld, we find its learn latent codes capture irrelevant visual detailssuch as background motion, lighting changes, textures, and camera displacementmaking the model sensitive to environmental changes, as further discussed in Sec. 5.5. Consequently, this incomplete separation ultimately leads to poor consistency in long-horizon tasks and limits the models ability to generalize to new environments. Dynamics-enhanced latent dynamic model. To address this issue, we introduce dynamics-enhanced Latent Dynamic Model (dLDM). The key mechanism is to replace the original LDM decoder with pretrained Video Diffusion Model (VDM). By leveraging the capacity of VDM for high-fidelity reconstruction to handle the appearance modeling, we allow the LDM encoder and learnable query embeddings to focus exclusively on capturing task-relevant visual changes. Although the VDM does not contain any knowledge of the target tasks dynamics, it is highly effective at producing realistic visual content once given appropriate dynamics guidance, making it well-suited for this decomposition (As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 7). Concretely, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 4, the dLDM consists of causal VQ-VAE that encodes future visual changes into discrete latent codes and pretrained VDM that reconstructs high-fidelity frames. The latent codes are provided to the VDM through projection layer and causal cross-attention. Since the VDM handles appearance modeling, the latent codes are relieved from encoding fine-grained visual details and can instead focus on capturing task-relevant dynamics. To maintain temporal correctness, we enforce causal attention in the VDM so that features at time attend only to information up to time t. Directly training the VDM to generate future frames from noise would be extremely slow and prone to incorrect motion, as it has never been trained on the target tasks like long-horizon handicraft making. Therefore, we reuse the VQ-VAE decoder to reconstruct latent codes into low-fidelity, motion-rich outputs, providing coarse temporal cues such as hand movements and object displacements. This signal is fed into the VDM via gradient-stopped, ControlNet-like [78] branch. This stabilizes training and allows the VDM to focus on refining appearance rather than inferring motion from scratch. Additionally, we stop the gradient flow of the decoder to the latent codes to prevent the introduction of irrelevant noise. We ablate this design in Sec. 5.5. By leveraging the VDM, the learned latent codes are much less affected by changes in appearance and stay consistent across environments. As shown in Sec. 7, latent codes corresponding to the similar action exhibit tighter intra-class alignment and reduced cross-environment variance, indicating robust and transferable dynamics. Auto-regressive transformer. After extracting the latent codes, we use an autoregressive transformer to . We model the latent dynamics sequence. For each video x0:T , the dLDM extracts latent codes {zn }K,N k=1,n= 7 Figure 6 Overview of Video-CraftBench and keys steps of paper folding tasks. Best viewed in color. flatten these into sequence and train the transformer to predict them, conditioned on the initial frame x0 and the task instruction. This allows the model to learn the long-term patterns in complex tasks. During inference (Fig. 5, right), given single input frame from new, unseen environment, the transformer predicts future latent dynamics based on its learned task representation, and the dLDM decodes them into coherent long-horizon execution videos. This allows VideoWorld 2 to transfer its learned dynamics to new environments and execute extended action sequences beyond those observed during training."

To improve training efficiency, dLDM first applies short warm-up where the latent codes are optimized solely using the original reconstruction objective. This warm-up is similar to the training strategy of the original VideoWorld LDM, enabling the latent codes to rapidly learn to compress visual changes and motion dynamics, while allowing the decoder to reconstruct low-fidelity video clips containing agent motion trajectories based on the initial frame and codes. Consequently, when we switch to the disentangled scheme, the decoder can provide robust motion conditioning to stabilize training.

By step 4 of paper folding (Column 7), success rates drop to 10.6%, with total failure to generate subsequent steps. Crucially, this failure persists even though we have provided detailed textual descriptions for each step during training and inference to leverage their text-conditioning capabilities. This demonstrates that current models struggle to learn complex, long-horizon knowledge from real-world videos, underscoring the need for more effective paradigm. Subsequently, we evaluate existing methods that leverage latent action or dynamic models. Following their protocols, we train these baselines on Video-CraftBench and train our AR transformer to predict their latent codes. Note that due to LAPA [72]s structural constraints, decoding its codes into long-horizon sequences causes severe degradation. Thus, we mark its results as N.A.. For the other three baselines, Moto [15] employs pre-trained vision encoder to extract dynamics, AdaWorld [24] utilizes an auxiliary diffusion head for video synthesis, and VideoWorld [51] features capabilities for long-horizon dynamics compression and generation. Although they generate coherent videos, they fail to generalize to novel environments. Specifically, none successfully completed the full paper folding sequence under new settings (e.g., different desktops or paper styles). As shown in Fig. 8, their predictions exhibit substantial action errors and scene distortions, indicating that their latent codes overfit to irrelevant appearance information. In contrast, VideoWorld 2 (row 9) generates complete and coherent task sequences in test environments. Remarkably, without requiring large-scale pre-training for these latent codes, training solely on VideoCraftBench achieves success rate of 68.8% on the paper folding task and up to 81.5% on the block stacking task. This demonstrates that our dLDM efficiently extracts core task-relevant action information while filtering out extraneous details like background clutter, object variations, and camera noise. Consequently, it generalizes effectively to unseen environments. Furthermore, benefiting from the appearance priors of the VDM, VideoWorld 2 not only generates accurate actions but also produces videos with higher SSIM and PSNR metrics. Fig. 2 and Supp. visualize our generated sequences. Data scaling with OpenX. Next, we evaluate whether the latent codes of VideoWorld 2 can benefit from larger-scale data. To this end, we incorporate the OpenX dataset [48], which contains vast collection of manipulation demonstrations. Compared to Video-CraftBench, OpenX features diverse array of robotic agents and environmental appearances, making it an ideal testbed for assessing VideoWorld 2s ability to filter out agent-specific and environmental factors while scaling its action extraction capabilities. Specifically, we first train dLDM and baseline models on combination of OpenX and Video-CraftBench, followed by training the AR transformer exclusively on Video-CraftBench using the resulting latent codes. As shown in line 10-12 of Tab. 1, the baselines show improved quality, raising success rates across tasks. However, Moto and iVideoGPT still fail to complete the full folding sequence.

Figure 7 UMAP of latent codes. With pretrained VDM, latent codes for the same action align more tightly than those in VideoWorld [51] across environments, indicating more consistent and transferable dynamics. (Left) In distinct environments like Bridge [58] and CALVIN [45], latent representations of the same action (e.g., the robotic arm moving right) are highly similar. (Right) Conversely, in VideoWorld, latent codes for the same action exhibit significant divergence across environments and fail to cluster effectively in the UMAP visualization. However, we observe that after warm-up, the decoder can reconstruct latent codes into videos that preserve coherent object motion (e.g., hand movements and displacements), although visual details remain blurry. Consequently, we utilize these reconstructions as conditions for the VDM via ControlNet-like structure to enhance output quality and stabilize training. Tab.3a further investigates this decoder. First, we stop the gradient from the decoder without using the reconstructed video (row 3) to verify if this decoder introduces noise. Compared to row 2, this yields 20% improvement in success rate, suggesting that the original decoder indeed introduces extraneous noise that degrades latent representation performance. Second, we investigate the utility of the reconstructed video itself. We find that utilizing this motion conditioning (rows 4 and 5) stabilizes video output, yielding substantial improvement of 0.9 in LPIPS and up to 20% in task success rate. This benefit is more pronounced in the longer paper folding task compared to block stacking, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for long-horizon video generation. Query embedding length of dLDM. Tab. 3b ablates the number of dLDM query embeddings . larger captures more information but also risks encoding noise and increases the sequence length for the AR transformer. We find that = 1 already achieves respectable task success rate, while = 4 provides the best performance balance. Increasing to 8 offers slight LPIPS benefit but introduces more noise, which 12 Figure 8 Visualization of failure cases in other baselines on the Video-CraftBench.

Tab. 3c ablates the interplay mechanism between the LDM and VDM, which consists of projection layer (MLP and causal self-attention) and causal cross-attention. The causal cross-attention ensures generation relies solely on the current time steps latents, effectively preventing information leakage. Results show that incorporating self-attention into the projection layer and utilizing causal cross-attention significantly enhance LDM-VDM interaction, validating the effectiveness of our design Horizon length in dLDM. Tab. 3e ablates the dLDM context length . At = 2 (a LAPA-like setting), codes remain transferable, but performance on the long-range paper folding task is poor due to lack of temporal perception. This minimal context also provides low-quality motion guidance for the VDM, leading to poor LPIPS scores. Performance improves as increases, plateauing at = 93, which corresponds to the maximum context length of our Cosmos VDM. dLDM codebook size. Tab. 3d examines the impact of the dLDM codebook size (adjusted via FSQ levels) on policy learning. We find that CALVIN, with its simpler action space, benefits from relatively small codebook. In contrast, the more complex Video-CraftBench requires larger codebook to achieve significant improvements. However, an excessively large codebook risks encoding extraneous noise and can hinder dLDM training convergence, finding consistent with VideoWorld [51]. Training strategies of VDM. In Tab. 3f, we examine different training configurations for the video diffusion 13 model. Our default approach fully fine-tunes the pre-trained VDM to exploit its appearance priors. In contrast, training randomly initialized VDM (row 1) leads to model collapse and fails to generate valid videos. We also experiment with freezing the pre-trained VDM and updating only the VQ-VAE components (encoder, quantizer, and projection layer). Although this setup yields performance gains, it falls significantly short of LoRA or full fine-tuning. We believe this gap exists because the VDM needs further adaptation to capture the fine-grained manipulation details specific to Video-CraftBench."

            "title": "6 Further Discussion with Other Works",
            "content": "We provide comprehensive analysis, highlighting the differences between VideoWorld 2 and prior works in both objectives and methodology. Regard task objectives. Most prior works focus on short-horizon prediction, simulated control, or reconstructioncentric tasks. In contrast, VideoWorld 2 targets complex, minute-long real-world tasks, where appearance variation and long-horizon error accumulation are dominant. This exposes appearance interference as critical bottleneck, necessitating our dLDM. Regarding disentanglement. Prior works [13, 51, 63, 66, 67, 72] rely on VAE-style reconstruction objectives to separate dynamics from appearance. As demonstrated in VideoWorld 2, this approach is insufficient for complex real-world videos, as reconstruction objectives compel latent codes to encode task-irrelevant details. VideoWorld 2 instead mitigates appearance interference by leveraging pretrained VDM for appearance modeling, forcing latents to focus on task-relevant dynamics. While CoLA [62] also employs VDM, it is limited to short 2-frame transitions. In contrast, VideoWorld 2 models multi-step dynamics and reuses coarse VAE decoder outputs to provide structured temporal cuesa mechanism critical for long-horizon tasks (Tab. 3a, rows 3 vs. 5). Replacing our dLDM with prior works tokenizers [67] or adopting CoLAs training scheme significantly degrades long-sequence performance, validating our design. Regarding the effect of the VDM. The role of the VDM in VideoWorld 2 also differs from prior approaches. Works such as ϵ-VAE [80] and DiVoT [26] utilize VDMs for pixel-level reconstruction, necessitating that latent codes encode both appearance and dynamics. Others, like IGOR [13] and AdaWorld [24], employ VDMs primarily for rendering. This disconnects the VDM from latent optimization, failing to improve task objectives. In contrast, VideoWorld 2 offloads appearance modeling to the VDM, compelling latents to focus exclusively on task-relevant dynamics. Compared to CoLA [62], VideoWorld 2 benefits from multi-frame modeling and VDM architecture specifically tailored for long-horizon learning."

            "content": "In this work, we explore knowledge learning for complex, long-horizon tasks from raw videos through experiments on Video-CraftBench and in robotic manipulation environments. We find that decoupling visual appearance from core actions is crucial for real-world knowledge learning. Based on this finding, we propose VideoWorld 2, model featuring dynamics-enhanced latent dynamics model (dLDM) that leverages pre-trained VDM to learn generalizable, transferable policies directly from video. While our method shows significant potential, we leave its continued scaling to future work, moving toward the goal of enabling AI to learn the vast knowledge encapsulated in the real world."

            "content": "Training details. We present the detailed training configurations of dynamics-enhanced latent dynamics model and auto-regressive transformer in Tab. 4. Dynamics-enhanced latent dynamics model (dLDM). As shown in Fig. 4, the proposed dLDM consists of four components. (i) causal encoder extracts visual features. (ii) set of learnable queries attends to the encoder features to extract visual changes and produce the latent dynamic codes. (iii) decoder reconstructs frames from the latent dynamic codes and the feature of the first frame, providing coarse motion cues. (iv) pretrained Video Diffusion Model (VDM) generates high-fidelity future frames by taking three inputs: the first frame, the low-resolution decoder outputs, and the latent dynamic codes. The latent codes are injected into the VDM via causal cross-attention, allowing the codes to concentrate on task-relevant dynamics while the VDM handles visual appearance modeling. We provide PyTorch-style pseudocode for the full dLDM and its components in Alg. ??. Latent pre-training on CALVIN. In Sec. 5.4 (line 432), we present latent pre-training experiment where latent dynamic tokens serve as prediction targets. This enables the model to learn manipulation knowledge from unlabeled data, thereby facilitating better adaptation to ground-truth actions. Following LAPA [72]s protocol, given task trajectory x0:T , we train the AR Transformer to predict the quantized latent dynamic embeddings {zn (defined in Sec. 3 line 198), conditioned on the language instruction and the first image x0. We extend the AR transformers vocabulary to include these latent dynamic tokens. Since this pre-training does not rely on ground-truth actions, it can use any unlabeled video data. }K,N k=1,n=1 Following latent pre-training, we further fine-tune the model with ground-truth labels to derive actions executable in the simulation environment. We append new action head (an MLP layer) to the transformer to map the hidden states, which are originally used for latent token prediction, to real actions via an ℓ2 loss. To ensure compatibility with cross-environment data, we exclusively use CALVINs static camera images during both pre-training and fine-tuning, omitting wrist images and state parameters. This latent pre-training should provide the AR transformer with manipulation prior, leading to better fine-tuning performance. Details in Video-CraftBench Key steps for evaluation. In Sec. 4.2 (line 314), we define seven key steps in the paper folding task to evaluate the task success rate. Fig. 6 (top) provides schematic diagram of these key steps. Train and test environments. Fig. 6 (bottom) illustrates the Video-CraftBench training and testing environments. To evaluate the models generalization to new environments, the test set features diverse variations compared to the training set. Specifically, the paper folding test set differs in background, texture, paper appearance, and camera viewpoints, while the block-building varies in initial block arrangement, color combinations, and camera angles. Task analysis. Fig. 9 shows the task duration distribution of Video-CraftBench. The largest portion (37.3%) falls within 4560 seconds, followed by 27.1% at 6090 seconds, while short tasks (2030s) make up only 10.9%. This distribution highlights our emphasis on long-horizon tasks. Regarding task types  (Fig. 10)  , paper folding accounts for 55.3% (5.2 hours) of the total duration due to its longer execution time, while block building comprises 1.8 hours. 20 dLDM AdamW 1e-4 0.

Figure 9 Video duration distribution. Figure 10 Task type distribution. Task classifier of Video-CraftBench. We detail the training of the classifier used to evaluate key step completion in Sec. 4.2 (line 314). Its primary objective is to determine whether the model has reached key steps by analyzing paper shapes and block arrangements. Appearance distractions, such as texture, color, and the background drift shown in Fig. 8 (last row), are disregarded. These visual quality is assessed separately via LPIPS and SSIM. Therefore, we initialize the classifier with DINOv2-Base (86M parameters), chosen for its exceptional geometric awareness and ability to extract fine-grained features. To train this classifier, we construct dataset of 25k labeled frames. First, we extract 15k frames of both key and non-key steps from the training and testing environments. To further enhance diversity and mitigate bias, we generate task execution videos using all models involved in the evaluation, manually verify successful trajectories, and extract an additional 10k frames. We then attach classification head to the DINOv2 backbone and fine-tune the entire model. The classifier achieves test accuracy of 96.1%, ensuring reliable judgment for subsequent evaluations. 21 // Encoder Function Algorithm 1: dLDM Algorithm (No Underline Hack) : Video sequence R(1+T )hw3 Input Variables : Learnable embeddings Qldm RN 1 Function encoder(video): Causal3DCNN(video) for layer in encoder_layers do layer(f ) end return z, [0] 8 end 9 Function ldm_qformer(f): q_list [] for 2 to do fk [: k] qk MLP(CrossAttention(Qldm, fk, fk)) q_list.append(qk) end return stack(q_list) 18 end 19 Function decoder(z, first_f): rec repeat(f irst_f, K, dim = 0) for _ in decoder_layers do rec Causal3DCNN(rec) rec up_scale(rec) end return rec 27 end 28 Function main(video): z, irst_f encoder(video) FSQ(z) if is_train then rec decoder(z.detach(), irst_f ) return MSE(rec, video) + VDM(video, z, rec) end return 2 3 4 6 7 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 20 22 23 24 25 26 30 31 32 33 34 36 37 end"

Thanks to the dLDM, VideoWorld 2 generates accurate long-horizon execution sequences in novel environments, producing visually coherent, high-quality videos. Note that the VDM processes only 93 frames at time, while full task sequences can span thousands of frames. Long videos are therefore generated auto-regressively by extending each segment from the final frame of the previous one. Because the VDMs inherent reconstruction noise accumulates over time, visual artifacts such as lighting, texture, or color shifts may gradually appear. Nevertheless, the key steps within the generated sequences remain accurate. 22 Figure 11 More visualization of VideoWorld 2 on Video-CraftBench."
