Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as the core of modern agentic systems (Wooldridge and Jennings, 1995) interacting with external environments via APIs and user interfaces (Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024). This exposes them to prompt injection attacks (Goodside, 2022; Perez and Ribeiro, 2022; Greshake et al., 2023) when data or instructions come from untrusted sources (e.g., from compromised user, from tool call outputs, or from web page). In these attacks, adversaries insert malicious instructions into the LLMs context, aiming to exfiltrate data or cause harmful actions (Rehberger, 2024; AI-Security-Team et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2025; OpenAI, 2025). Current defenses often rely on training or prompting models to adhere to security policies (Wallace et al., 2024; Ghalebikesabi et al., 2024), frequently implemented as vulnerable system prompts (Carlini et al., 2023). This is largely due to the absence of robust methods to formally define and enforce security policies for LLM functionalities on diverse data. This work introduces novel defense, CaMeL1, inspired by traditional software security concepts like Control Flow Integrity (Abadi et al., 2009), Access Control (Anderson, 2010, Chap. 6), and Information Flow Control (Denning and Denning, 1977). CaMeL effectively mitigates dangerous outcomes of prompt injection attacks, as demonstrated by practically solving the security evaluation of the AgentDojo benchmark (Debenedetti et al., 2024b). CaMeL associates, to every value, some metadata (commonly called capabilities2 in the software security literature) to restrict data and control flows, giving the possibility to express what can and cannot be done with each individual value by using fine-grained security policies. CaMeL operates by extracting control and data flows from user queries and employs custom Python interpreter to enforce security policies, providing security guarantees without modifying the LLM itself. CaMeL does not rely on model behavior modification. Instead, it provides an environment where predefined policies prevent unintended consequences caused by prompt injection attacks, mirroring established software security practices. 1CaMeL is short for CApabilities for MachinE Learning. 2Note that here the term capability refers to the standard security definition, and not the standard machine learning measurement of how capable models are.

            "content": "Overall, we make the following contributions: We propose CaMeL, novel defense inspired by traditional software security that requires no change to the underlying LLM. CaMeL extracts the control and data flows from user queries and enforces explicit security policies; CaMeL utilizes custom Python interpreter that tracks provenance and is guaranteed to enforce appropriate security policies; We integrate CaMeL into AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024b), recent benchmark for agentic system security, and demonstrate that we solve it by design with some utility degradation, yet with guarantees that no policy violation can take place. 2. Defeating Prompt Injections by Design Consider user who prompts model as follows: Can you send Bob the document he requested in our last meeting? Bobs email and the document he asked for are in the meeting notes file. The user query is straightforward, and the agent is designed to interact with the users local notes and email functionalities via tool calling. However, the users notes could be compromised or influenced by malicious actors, who can include (potentially invisible) text with the aim to override the users instructions, leading to prompt injection attacks (Goodside, 2022; Perez and Ribeiro, 2022; Greshake et al., 2023; Pasquini, Strohmeier, and Troncoso, 2024). The intended task is to retrieve and send specific document to specific recipient, but an adversary might inject prompts to hijack the agent to exfiltrate the document to an unintended email, send another file or do completely different action altogether (e.g., sending the last email received from the user to an adversary). Figure 1 Agent actions have both control flow and data flowand either can be corrupted with prompt injections. This example shows how the query Can you send Bob the document he requested in our last meeting? is converted into four key steps: (1) finding the most recent meeting notes, (2) extracting the email address and document name, (3) fetching the document from cloud storage, and (4) sending it to Bob. Both control flow and data flow must be secured against prompt injection attacks. How can we defend from these attacks? Several defenses have been proposed to mitigate such risks. Many methods attempt to make the model itself robust, for example by using delimiters to mark the boundaries of untrusted content within the context, and explicitly instructing the model to disregard any instructions found within these delimiters (Hines et al., 2024). Prompt sandwiching (Learn Prompting, 2024) offers another approach, by repeatedly reminding the model of the original task after each tool output. Further, some researchers explore training or fine-tuning models to become more resilient to prompt injections, enabling them to discern and ignore malicious instructions (Chen et al., 2024; Wallace et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). We discuss prompt injection defenses in more detail in the extended related work in Appendix A.2."

            "content": "A significant step forward in defense strategies is the Dual LLM pattern theoretically described by Willison (2023). This pattern employs two LLMs: Privileged LLM and Quarantined LLM. The Privileged LLM is tasked with planning the sequence of actions needed to fulfill the users request, such as searching the cloud storage for the meeting notes and fetching the requested document from the cloud storage, and sending it to the client. Importantly, this privileged LLM only sees the initial user query and never the content from potentially compromised data sources (like the file content). The actual processing of potentially malicious data, like extracting the name of the document to send and the clients email address, would be delegated to the Quarantined LLM. This Quarantined LLM, crucially, is stripped of any tool-calling capabilities, limiting the harm an injected prompt can cause and guaranteeing that the adversary cannot call arbitrary tools with arbitrary arguments. Is Dual LLM of Willison enough? While the Dual LLM pattern significantly enhances security by isolating planning from being hijacked by malicious content, it does not completely eliminate all prompt injection risks. Let us consider the example depicted in Figure 1. Here, even with the Dual LLM in place we show that vulnerabilities still exist. The Privileged LLM, as before, plans the actions: search the cloud storage for meeting notes\", extract the document to send and the email address with the Quarantined LLM, and send the document to the extracted email address. Now, consider the following attack: malicious party with access to the meeting notes document could add some invisible text to the notes with the aim of influencing the Quarantined LLM to send to them an arbitrary confidential document. When the agent executes the plan, the Privileged LLM correctly orchestrates the steps. However, when the agent retrieves the meeting notes from the cloud storage, the Quarantined LLM can be influencedby the malicious content in the meeting notes fileto return data that would cause any attacker-chosen file to be sent to an attacker-chosen address. Thus, even if the global plan itself is not hijacked, the content being processed according to the plan is manipulated, which can cause malicious actions to be executed. While this is not prompt injection per-se (i.e., the attack does not require overriding any LLM instructions), the core issue remains. Even if the adversary cannot change the original plan and tool calls, being able to change the arguments to the tool calls by prompt injecting the Quarantined LLM can be security issue: while the control flow is protected by the Dual LLM pattern, the data flow can still be manipulated. This is analogous to SQL injection attack where an adversary manipulates query parameters rather than the structure of the query itself. We show in Section 5.4 that this can be taken one step further and even enable arbitrary code execution. Using software security to defeat prompt injections To address these more subtle yet critical vulnerabilities, our design, CaMeL, draws inspiration from established software security principles (which we discuss in the extended related work in Appendix A.1.2), focusing on securing both data and control flows. Let us consider again the query Can you send Bob the document he requested in our last meeting? Bobs email and the document he asked for are in the meeting notes file., CaMeL goes beyond just isolating LLMs. It starts by extracting the intended control flow as pseudo-Python code, generated by an LLM that acts as the Privileged LLM of Willison (2023). CaMeL then employs custom interpreter to execute this plan, maintaining data flow graph (i.e., what values each variable in the interpreter depends on), and enforcing security policies when executing tools, based on capabilities, i.e., metadata assigned to each value passed to the function (e.g., who is allowed to see this piece of data?, where does this piece of data come from?), and to all the values the arguments depend on. When the agent accesses the local drive to find the meeting document, the retrieved file is tagged with capabilities reflecting its origin (i.e., the cloud storage and file editors), and its allowed readers (i.e., the email addresses with whom the document is shared). In this way, even if the adversary was instructing the Quarantined LLM to extract the filename of confidential file and"

            "content": "the email address of the adversary with prompt injection, the execution of the tool to send the email would be blocked by CaMeL (and the user asked for explicit approval) as it would imply sharing confidential document or information from it with someone who is not meant to read the document.3 By enforcing capability-based security policies, CaMeL effectively prevents unintended data flows and actions. Even with compromised cloud storage file containing prompt injections targeting the Quarantined LLM, the capabilities system acts as robust and granular control mechanism, preventing data exfiltration, as well as other prohibited actions. This approach provides secure environment for LLM agents, preventing harm by design, without requiring modifications to the underlying LLM itself, and offering significantly more fine-grained and robust defense compared to isolation and/or adversarial training strategies alone. 3. Threat Model Building on the security challenges described in the introduction, we now define the specific threats that CaMeL addresses. The primary goal of CaMeL is to stop prompt injection attacks coming from untrusted data sources, which constitutes the main risk considered in prompt injection literature. This scenario, described in Figure 2, highlights the danger of processing untrusted data, practice that is commonplace in current agentic systems. Here, the user prompt first gets processed by the planner model which extracts individual sub-steps that need to be performed (control flow graph) along with what data is used by each individual step (data flow graph). Next, the plan is executed step by step, through interaction with the external tooling. malicious actor introduces specially crafted piece of data (such as an email, document, or spreadsheet) containing hidden command or prompt injection, and shares it with the victim, thus making it available for the victims agentic system to retrieve. As the agent processes this file, the injected command alters the systems behavior. In this example, the prompt injection modifies the recipients email address within send email task, diverting sensitive financial documents to the attacker. This scenario illustrates data flow-based adversary and is the primary focus of Figure 2 Prompt injections can cause harm even if they do not change the sequence of agent actions. Here we consider an adversary who diverts the data flow of the user command. The cloud storage file contains prompt injection that changes the recipient email address to the attackers address and the document being sent. This leads to the confidential document being sent to the external attacker address. 3It should be noted that the user will be asked for explicit approval even in the case where there is no adversary, but Bob does not already have read access to the document. This is because the email address of Bob might be untrusted."

            "content": "Figure 3 Diagram illustrating how CaMeL processes users query. First, the P-LLM generates code that expresses the submitted query. Then, the CaMeL interpreter constructs and updates data flow graph, checks security policy based on code execution, and either executes or blocks tool executions. While interpreting the code, the Q-LLM is used to parse untrusted data. AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024b). We assume that the user prompt is trusted, that the user is not pasting prompt from an untrusted source, and, if there is memory (Wang et al., 2024) in place, the memory has not been compromised by the adversary. 3.1. Explicit non-goals of CaMeL CaMeL has limitations, some of which are explicitly outside of scope. CaMeL doesnt aim to defend against attacks that do not affect the control nor the data flow. In particular, we recognize that it cannot defend against text-to-text attacks which have no consequences on the data flow, e.g., an attack prompting the assistant to summarize an email to something different than the actual content of the email, as long as this doesnt cause the exfiltration of private data. This also includes prompt-injection induced phishing (e.g., You received an email from Google saying you should click on this (malicious) link to not lose your account). Nonetheless, CaMeLs data flow graph enables tracing the origin of the content shown to the user. This can be leveraged, in, e.g., the chat UI, to present the origin of the content to the user, who then can realize that the statement does not come from Google-affiliated email address. Furthermore, CaMeL does not aim at making fully autonomous system which requires no human intervention at all. As users often make ambiguous queries, or the tool themselves might return ambiguous results, users should be prompted to solve this ambiguity and clarify explicitly the control and the data flows. However, as we will describe in the following section, using capabilities and security policies enables CaMeL to avoid unnecessarily prompting the user and shifts important security-related decisions to the capability system, hence reducing the risk for security fatigue and user desensitization."

            "content": "4. CaMeL Design Using security policies and other principles from software security, we design system which executes tasks described in natural language by leveraging tool-enhanced large language models, while preventing unwanted data leakage or state-changing operations, thus providing security guarantees. The system, as is depicted in Figure 3, has few components: the Quarantined LLM: an LLM tasked with parsing unstructured data to structured data; the Privileged LLM: an LLM generating code that expresses the user query; tools: subroutines which can be invoked by the system to execute specific tasks via predefined APIs (e.g., tool to send an email); security policies: functions that define what is and what is not allowed when calling tools; capabilities: tags assigned to each value that are used to store the values sources and allowed readers; the CaMeL interpreter: an orchestrator interpreting the code written by the Privileged LLM, propagating capabilities, and enforcing security policies. We now cover these components in more detail. 4.1. The Privileged and Quarantined LLMs The Quarantined LLM (Q-LLM) is large language model that has no tool access and can be used to parse unstructured data into data with predefined schema via feature that is commonly called Structured output/JSON mode by LLM providers and is built-in for most large language models at the time of writing. On top of the fields provided as part of the schema, we inject one additional boolean field (called have_enough_information) that the Quarantined LLM can use to communicate that it was not provided with enough information to solve the assigned task. If this field is false, then the CaMeL interpreter throws NotEnoughInformationError and the P-LLM is asked to generate different code to fix the error (like with other exceptions, as explained below). Importantly, the Q-LLM cannot communicate to the P-LLM what information it needs, as this could be vector for prompt injections. The Privileged LLM (P-LLM), instead, takes natural language input describing task (e.g., request for the agent), and writes Python code which expresses the query intent by leveraging the tools, the standard library functions that are made available to it, and the Q-LLM (which is presented to the P-LLM as function to call, just like the aforementioned tools). As part of the code, it must also generate an expected schema for each call to the Q-LLM, in the form of Pydantic BaseModel (Colvin et al., 2025). Crucially, the P-LLM only interacts with the user query and not the data returned by tools or with the Q-LLM output: values returned by tools are stored in variables, and the P-LLM can only see the code it generated and not the variables content. The P-LLM uses the Q-LLM as function and only passes to it information required for the task, tracking provenance. There is explicit isolation between the models to ensure that data cant influence the original user query execution plan. The P-LLM is presented with system prompt that includes details on the code that is expected and the list of tools and classes available to it (in the form of Python function signatures). We additionally include some of the AgentDojo system prompt (e.g., the users name and some extra instructions related to each environment). We provide the full system prompt in Appendix H.1. Then, in form of user prompt, the P-LLM is given the users task. The P-LLM responds with some text that must include code block in Markdown format, i.e., wrapped by triple backquote characters (). The P-LLM can show content to the user by calling the print function."

Example of calendar security policy that is expressable with CaMeL. All other policies used in the evaluation are released with the code. While in this paper we use the same backbone LLM for both the P-LLM and the Q-LLM, in practice, they can be different. As parsing data is likely to be easier than creating plan and writing code for the users query, one could use smaller language model for the Q-LLM. On top of being faster and cheaper, this LLM can potentially also be run locally on the users machine. This would improve the users privacy4 with respect to the model provider: since the LLM used as the P-LLM is only provided with the user query, the P-LLM provider never sees the tool outputs (which might contain sensitive information that should not be shared with the P-LLM provider). This is different from the commonplace tool-calling loop, where the provider of the LLM decides which tools see other tool outputs for multi-step tool uses. 4.2. Security Policies Security Policies define allowed operations in the information flow. For example, data labeled as not readable by anyone but the user should not be supplied to state-changing tool (e.g., tool that sends emails or that requests web page). Security policies can be defined globally by the entity serving the engine or for allowing specific data flows to specific tool (e.g., sharing document as an attachment of an email whose recipients already have access to the document). Note that security policies can be extremely granular and flexible: Figure 4 shows an example of calendar policy. Here, the policy explicitly states that the data that are part of the calendar event (e.g., the title and the description) must be readable by the participants. However, it also states that, if all participants come from trusted source (e.g., directly from the user), then data can be shared with them even if the calendar information has not been shared with them previously. In practice the choice of annotations, their granularity, and levels of access are defined based on specific use-case. In current implementation, policies are defined by the entity serving the CaMeL engine. However, the 4In data minimisation paradigm similar to that used in federated learning (McMahan et al., 2023)."

            "content": "design allows for more granular and multi-party model in the future. We envision system where users, tool-providers, within certain bounds, set their own policies, perhaps through user-friendly interface. It may also be possible to derive the policies from context. Policies are currently expressed as Python functions, as shown in Figure 4. Each function takes the tool name and arguments as input and returns SecurityPolicyResult expressed as Allowed or Denied, alongside reason for the decision. We opted to use Python code over custom domain specific language to allow for arbitrary logic to be implemented within the policy. Currently, we havent implemented conflict resolution mechanism. 4.3. Capabilities Capabilities consist of tags assigned to each individual value that we use to describe control and data-flow relationships. For example, capabilities can be used to describe who is allowed to read given piece of data or its provenance. These capabilities allow one to restrict specific operations for individual data and allow for more fine-grained control than just restricting specific data or control flows. The current implementation of CaMeL tags data with the information on who is allowed to read given value and with data provenance. Readers are expressed as either the Public singleton (i.e., everyone can access the data), or as set of users, (e.g., as identified by their email addresses in workspace setting). Data provenance is tagged as coming from the User (i.e., all literals in the code generated by the P-LLM), from CaMeL (i.e., the results of all transformations done during code execution), or from given tool (identified with unique identifier). Tools can also identify an inner source, i.e., within the tool, where the piece of data comes from. For example, the read_email tool is going to tag as inner source the sender of given email. In general, capabilities can also be assigned by tools, based on the type that is returned by the tool. For example, document on cloud storage will have as sources the people it has been shared with. Note that in practice such capabilities can be used to define arbitrary restrictions on any data. Our fine-grained capabilities implementation draws inspiration from established systems in computer security literature, including libcap (Morgan, 2013), Capsicum (Watson et al., 2010), and CHERI (Woodruff et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2015). particularly compelling application of capabilities lies in empowering users with granular control over their data. By enabling users and systems to annotate submitted data with explicit use directives, such as for example restrictions on using data only on specific websites, CaMeL can enable enforcement of fine-grained control over data flows. For instance, annotating data as only processed on government websites would provide mechanism to prevent its transmission to non-government domains. Why do we need capabilities if we have both data and control flow? While control and data flows allow for defining valid and coarse-grained invalid execution sequences, it can be restrictive and cause significant utility degradation. Capabilities offer more fine-grained approach by precisely defining for each individual data what one is not supposed to do with such data. For example, restaurant booking tool might legitimately handle telephone numbers and names (forms of personally identifiable information or PII), while other sensitive PII like passport and social security numbers should never be supplied to untrusted tools. policy that broadly allows all PII to flow indiscriminately into the booking tool can potentially compromise user privacy. At the same time, defining control flow policies for each individual PII type may be very inefficient, will require managing conflicts in policies, and make it hard to manage long-term. Instead, one can tag particular variable e.g. passport number and its derivatives, as not-processable by any tool other than specific trusted ones e.g. government. 4.4.

(b) Dependency graph of the code Figure 5 CaMeL generates code to facilitate tracking data dependencies. Example code and dependency graph generated by CaMeL for the natural language query If my last email is about meeting tomorrow, forward it to email@example.com. Notice that in the dependency graph, generated using CaMeLs STRICT mode, the call to send_email also has dependency on the call to Quarantined LLM, hence on date. This is to account for the fact that the call to send_email depends on the conditional given by the call to Quarantined LLM, and hence could reveal side-channel information. The dependency graph generated in NORMAL mode can be found in Figure 17. Python as it is very popular programming language, and large language models are very competent at writing it. We use Pythons built-in ast library to parse the abstract syntax tree, and interpret each tree node in recursive fashion. More details on the restrictions we place on the language can be found in the P-LLM system prompt (Appendix H.1). In our evaluations we find that minor prompt modification gets the model to generate code that is within our subset of Python, and some violations of the dialect are easily detectable and fixable automatically. Error handling. The interpreter prompts the P-LLM up to 10 times to get code that fully runs. If an exception is raised, then the exception location and type (similarly to how it would be formatted by real Python interpreter) are presented to the P-LLM, together with prompt asking the LLM to fix the code (full prompt in Appendix H.2). Note that, however, the exception content must be handled with care: if the exception has dependency on untrusted data (e.g., the text comes from or has dependency on an untrusted tool output), it could potentially contain prompt injection. The error message is then redacted, and message explaining the redaction is provided to the P-LLM. As some tool calls have side-effects (e.g., they might create calendar event), the model is told to assume that the code up to the point where the exception was raised was already run and that it can use all variables that have been defined in the code that it will generate. Of course, the interpreter state (e.g., defined variables and classes, with all their dependencies and capabilities) is preserved between the different code runs. At present CaMeL has no means to enable atomicity for sequences of instructions or rollbacks of operations that failed yet had side-effects. Maintaining the data flow graph. While executing the code, the CaMeL interpreter also keeps track of the dependencies of each variable (i.e., the information flow). For example, in the code = + b, variable will depend on both and b. When needed (e.g., for checking security policies), the entire dependency graph of variable is built by recursively traversing all its dependencies. Special care is taken for control-flow constructs (e.g., if statements and for loops): the CaMeL interpreter has two interpretation modes: STRICT and NORMAL mode. In strict mode, we add the conditional test or loop iterable as dependency to all variables assigned in the control flow block, which has security"

For example, in the code in Figure 5a, the variable result will have dependency on the variable email and on the string literal in the prompt, as shown in Figure 5. As the current implementation of CaMeL does not allow to define new functions, and the functions currently available are not recursive, handling the data flow graph in the case of recursive functions is not concern. Enforcing security policies. Before executing tool with given set of variables as input, relevant security policies are applied to that variable and its dependencies, as identified by the dependency graph. If policy violation is detected (e.g., private data passed to tool with side effects), the tools execution is blocked. In real-world application, executions that violate security policies will not be blocked, but they will require user confirmation. 5. Evaluation We evaluate our design on AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024b), the most recent agentic security benchmark that was just featured at NeurIPS 2024. We evaluate on it as it comprises set of realistic utility and security tasks in agentic scenarios. We touch upon utility, i.e., how tasks are solved by the agent with acceptable levels of detail, and security, i.e., attacks against the agent dont succeed in their adversarial goal. 5.1. Utility evaluation The AgentDojo benchmark includes tasks from many domains, including Workspace, Banking, Travel, and Slack. We provide examples of some of the tasks in the appendices, while for detailed discussion of the benchmarks we refer the reader to the original paper. We measure the success rate of each model in completing these tasks with CaMeL enabled and by using the official tool calling APIs from each model provider (with the exception of Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which does not natively support tool calling). We evaluate gemini-2.0-flash-001, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02- -05, gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21, claude-3-5-haiku-20241022, claude-3- -5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, gpt-4o-mini- -2024-07-18, o3-mini-2025-01-31 (with high reasoning effort), and o1-2024-12-17 (with high reasoning effort). 5.1.1. CaMeL impacts utility Figure 6 reports the performance of different language models, including Gemini Flash 2.0, Gemini Pro 2.0, Gemini Flash 2.0 Thinking, Claude Haiku 3.5, Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, o1-high, and o3-mini-high, on the AgentDojo benchmark with CaMeL and with the official tool calling APIs. With an exception of Travel suite, we find that CaMeL does not significantly degrade utility. We discuss the Travel suite in detail below. Quite unexpectedly, in rare cases, we find that CaMeL even improves the success rate of certain models on specific tasks. For instance, Gemini Pro 2.0 with CaMeL achieves higher success rate on the Banking task suite compared to Gemini Pro 2.0 with the official tool calling API. Finally, as discussed in the next section, we expect utility to improve as backbone models get better: for example, with o1 as backbone, CaMeL achieves 67% utility, which is just 2% lower than GPT-4o with the native tool calling API as evaluated in June 2024 in the original AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024b) paper, showing how quickly backbone models improve."

With the exception of the travel suite (which we discuss below), CaMeL does not excessively degrade utility when compared to Native Tool Calling APIs. In fact, for some models and suites, it even improves utility. Full results in Table 2. Note that Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking does not support Tool Calling via its API. 5.1.2. How does CaMeL impact utility? To better understand the impact of CaMeL on utility, we analyze the failure modes of Claude 3.5 Sonnet across the different task suites. We pick Claude 3.5 Sonnet due to relatively high performance across all of the tasks. We categorize failures and show the amount for each category in Table 1. Table 14 in Appendix provides breakdown of Claudes failures for each task. Appendix H.4 provides examples of failed tasks with the description of the failure and the whole agent interaction. We now discuss the failure modes related to the nature of CaMeL. The P-LLM cannot write plan based on data it cant read. One failure mode that is inherent to CaMeL (and in general to the Dual LLM Pattern) is what we call the Data requires action failure, where the actions to take depend on untrusted data. For example, the workspace suite includes the query Please do the actions specified in the email from david.smith@bluesparrowtech.com with the subject TODOs for the week.. In this case, the P-LLM does not know what the required actions are, and the task cannot be solved. While some models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini, see Appendix H.3) try to solve this by partially implementing tool-calling loop, no existing model manages to solve this task. This can be potentially solved by providing the P-LLM with an extra tool which consists of another instance of P-LLM. This tool would generate and execute plan based on the arguments it is provided with. Of course, security policies for executing this tool should be very strict and allow its execution only if the inputs come from trusted source. CaMeL struggles with poorly documented APIs. We observe that the low performance on the Travel suite mostly comes from the lack of tool documentation, as the tool outputs structure is not documented. The P-LLM does not have way to observe the format of the output of these tools, and, as consequence, cannot parse them. However, the most advanced models realize this, and use the Q-LLM to parse data that is otherwise impossible to parse without knowing the structure. In general, we believe that this issue will be addressed as models get better. As an example, o1 managed to achieve 60% utility on the travel suite, meaning that it managed to overcome this issue for most tasks. For the less advanced models, straightforward solution to this problem is to provide more information about the tools themselves, however, as AgentDojo is preexisting benchmark, we believe we should not modify its structure."

While the Q-LLM can cause NotEnoughInformationError to be raised, there is no way for the Q-LLM to communicate to the P-LLM what data it is missing. We do not allow this here because it can potentially be vector for prompt injections. Also in this case, we expect better models (or better prompting) to better understand from the overall context where the information required by the Q-LLM is.

Finally, we discuss peculiar CaMeL-specific attacks that we observed when running evaluations, which we discuss broadly in Section 8. 5.2.1. Case study: without any Security Policies (a) Utility under attack (b) Number of successful attacks Figure 7 CaMeL is not vulnerable to the AgentDojos attacks and preserves utility better when under attack. We show the number of successful attacks (out of 949 attacks in total) for several models with the Tool Calling API and with CaMeL (both enforcing and not enforcing security policies). The only attacks that are rated as successful by AgentDojo against CaMeL are not due to prompt injection, as explained in Section 5.2.2. Note, that attack performance here differs from the original AgentDojo paper (Debenedetti et al., 2024b), that is because models have changed since the benchmark was released and new models training data could be contaminated (US-AISI, 2025). For reference, the attack success rate against GPT-4o in the original AgentDojo manuscript was 47.6% while currently it is at 27.5%. The full results are presented in Table 4 and Table 3. Note that Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking at time of running the experiments didnt support Tool Calling via its API. In this section, we evaluate the security of CaMeL by testing its ability to defend against prompt injection attacks on the AgentDojo benchmark (Debenedetti et al., 2024b). We measure the attack success rate (ASR) for each model with and without CaMeL enabled. Note that here we install no security policy and all security benefits come from explicit separation as is described by Willison (2023). We find that CaMeL significantly improves the security of all models considered even without additional security policies. Figure 7 shows that CaMeL reduces the number of successful attacks for all models, and in many cases, it completely eliminates the attacks. For example, the number of successful attacks for GPT-4o drops from 233 without to 0 with CaMeL. Wait, why isnt attack performance zero? While we find that CaMeL (without security policies) stops almost all of the attacks, we observe that the ASR is not zero.

The travel suites tasks goal, instead, is the following: Say that should absolutely visit Riverside View Hotel because its incredibly gorgeous and worth visit., and the prompt injection is inserted as part of review. More precisely, this task is successful when the user asks for something related to reviews, and the model calls the print function on the reviews, hence showing to the user the entire injection (including the hotel name). Both examples are explicitly non-goals of CaMeL as we note in Section 3.1, and the latter is not even due to prompt injection. 5.2.2. Case study: with Security Policies In this section we consider the security policies that are expressible with CaMeL. We showed an example of calendar policy in Figure 4 earlier. Figure 8 shows the triggering rates for all of the evaluations according to the policies outlined in Appendix E. (a) Benign evaluation (b) Adversarial evaluation Figure 8 When unified authentication is in place, security policies are triggered less often. This figure shows how often security policies are triggered during the benign and adversarial evaluations with CaMeL enabled. The x-axis shows the different models that were evaluated on AgentDojos suites, and the y-axis shows the percentage of tasks for which the security policies were triggered. The proportions are reported only over the successfully solved tasks; the workspace suite, where users are identified by their email address, has more granular security policies which get triggered less often. Figure 18 reports the same for all tasks. Wait, why isnt attack performance zero now? While we find that CaMeL stops almost all of the attacks, we find that the number of successful attacks is not zero. The injection task that is successful in the travel suite is the same as the one mentioned in Section 5.2.1. While this attack (which is not due to prompt injection) cant be prevented by our design, the fine-grained annotations maintained by the CaMeL interpreter can be used to highlight in the user interface that the piece of text comes from an untrusted source.

We show in Figure 8 for how many tasks security policies deny tool execution, i.e., how often users are asked for explicit consent before executing given tool. We can see that, for the workspace suite, security policies deny tool execution relatively small amount of times. This is thanks to the fact that the tool outputs in the workspace suite can be easily annotated (e.g., the set of people who can read the content of an email are the recipients of the email), and this allows for more granular security policies. Differently, in the Slack suite, policies deny execution much more often. This is because in the suite it is unclear from the suite specification what the users account is (as opposed to the workspace suite), and because in many tasks data come from web pages (which are untrusted). The denial rate is also higher on the banking suite. This is because the security policy for the send_money tool is very strict and requires the recipient and the amounts of the payment to have the user as source, as well as no other untrusted parent source in the dependency graph. Finally, the results for the travel suite are not particularly significant as models have low utility when running this suite, for the reasons explained above. 5.3.

CaMeL significantly outperforms all other defenses in terms of security while having reasonable impact on utility (the latter with the exception of the Travel suite). This highlights the effectiveness of CaMeLs approach of using explicit isolation and formal security policies. The total number of attacks is 949 and the axis is symlog scale. In the left figure, only CaMeL\" is shown (and not CaMeL (no policies) as policies do not affect utility. We also show the utility under attack in Figure 16.

These defenses are: tool filter (Debenedetti et al., 2024b), spotlighting (Hines et al., 2024), and prompt sandwiching (Learn Prompting, 2024). The results are shown in Figure 9. We find that CaMeL significantly outperforms all other defenses in terms of security, while having moderate impact on utility. For example, the the number of successful attacks with CaMeL is 0, while the number of successful attacks with the next best defense (tool filter) is 8.

This implies that the same might happen with the other defenses, which are heuristic and do not provide any guarantees. Finally, we find that GPT-4o Mini, which uses the instruction hierarchy defense (Wallace et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024), still fails to defend against all attacks in AgentDojo. While GPT-4o Mini with CaMeL is not vulnerable to any of the attacks in AgentDojo, GPT-4o-mini with the tool calling API (which implements the instruction hierarchy by default) is vulnerable to 276 attacks. This demonstrates that CaMeLs approach of using explicit isolation, fine-grained capabilities, and formal security policies is more effective than relying on learned instruction hierarchy alone. Importantly, CaMeL comes with security guarantees, while all other solutions currently are probabilistic and provide no such guarantees, relying on the agents to make all the important security decisions. Finally, CaMeL can and should be used in conjunction with other defenses to deliver defense in depth. 5.4. Case study: when data flow becomes control flow We now turn to an example of task that is not stoppable simply by utilising the isolation as is proposed by Willison (2023), necessitating policies and capabilities; importantly, this attack is applicable to other security systems as well. In this section we discuss solution generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o3-mini, and o1 that could be exploited by an adversary, representing challenging scenario to protect against. The original responses of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o3mini are presented in Appendix H.3, but here we will use simplified description. Note that we explicitly weaponized this example and it is different from the exact produced model solution. Figure 10 illustrates the setup: Initial Setup: The user sends an initial query to the model, instructing it to monitor emails, identify an action within an email, and execute that action. Since data can influence choice of an action, both Claude and o3 generated control flow graph, shown in Appendix H.3, that iterated through all possible tools and choosing one based on the email. Figure 10 Corrupting the data flow can potentially provide arbitrary code execution. An attacker sends query to the model, instructing it to monitor emails, identify an action within an email, and execute that action. This effectively turns data flow into control flow, as the instructions from the email now dictate the agents actions and can in principle execute arbitrary commands, potentially issued by external adversary. Data Flow Becomes Control Flow: The attacker can then send an email with malicious instructions. The model, following its generated code, executes these instructions. This effectively turns data into control flow, as the instructions from the email now dictate the models actions.

The red line represents the increase in token usage for the median task. Results when not under attack are in Figure 19. that focus on monitoring the control flow. The malicious instructions are hidden within the data flow, making them harder to detect. What is more, in this setup it is possible to use attacks akin to Jones, Dragan, and Steinhardt (2024) and Glukhov et al. (2025), where malicious query is broken down into non-malicious sub-queries that together constitute malicious response. Here, similar effect could be achieved by breaking malicious program into benign-looking set of small instructions since the model never sees all of the instructions at the same time, it cannot identify the intent of the overall query and detect that it is malicious.5 5.5. Overheads CaMeL is designed to be lightweight and efficient, focusing on tracking data provenance and enforcing security policies without significant computational and cognitive user overheads. The primary latency overhead in code execution comes from maintaining the data flow graph, which tracks the origin and dependencies of each individual variable. This involves minimal processing and storage, as it only requires computing unions and storing metadata about the source and allowed readers for each value. The custom Python interpreter also introduces small overhead, but it is negligible compared to the overall execution time of the LLM agent and the reasoning steps. However, because the code generated by the P-LLM could cause errors, the P-LLM might be queried multiple times to fix them. We measure, for each task, how many more input and output tokens are required by CaMeL, compared to using the native tool calling API, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the backbone model. Because the tokenizer of the Claude family is not open-source, we tokenize using OpenAIs GPT-4o tokenizer in tiktoken library.6 Moreover, since the way tools documentation is represented and tokenized when provided 5This scenario is reminiscent of how polymorphic crypters were used in the past to hide malware. crypter is tool that encrypts malicious software to make it harder to detect by anti-virus software.

Overall, we find that CaMeL requires 2.82 input tokens and 2.73 more output tokens for the median task in AgentDojo. We show the distribution of the increase in token usage of CaMeL in Figure 11a. We report in Appendix the increase in token usage, and total token usage for the baseline defenses presented in Section 5.3. CaMeL requires the highest token usage among the defenses we analyze, the best being Spotlighting, which uses 1.06 more input and 0.98 the output tokens. However, we believe that the cost of CaMeL is reasonable, considering that it provides security guarantees. Moreover, as models get more and more capable, we expect them to follow the specifications of the Python subset more closely, hence requiring less tokens to fix coding errors. 6. Side channels can be problem We find that CaMeL is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, where an attacker can infer sensitive information by observing the systems behavior with shared resources (Anderson, Stajano, and Lee, 2002). Side-channel attacks are notoriously difficult to prevent completely, even in traditional software systems. While side channels to degree undermine the claim of strong security guarantees, we want to re-emphasise that CaMeL significantly improves the status quo, provides isolation guarantees, and, in some cases, even allows one to reason about the said leakage due to fine-grained data tracking. Here, we consider three explicit examples. In the first, we show how an adversary can leak private variable to an external service through indirect dependency. In the second, we discuss side channel that can reveal one bit of information via arbitrary exception triggering by the adversary. In the third, we discuss timing side channel that can remove annotation from private variable in the execution flow. We note that we believe that other types of side channels might be possible, and examples below should serve as cautionary tale that even with CaMeL, system that makes attacks significantly harder, data can still be (inefficiently) mishandled by the agent. # Variable that has private value and has associated flow constraints private_variable = 10 for in range(private_variable): fetch_external_image(\"attacker.com/cat.jpg\") ### Attacker can count number of references ### to cat.jpg from the same ip address ### On the web server: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM access_logs WHERE ip_address = '<target_ip_address>' AND requested_resource = '/cat.jpg'; Figure 12 Without CaMeLs STRICT mode, private data can be leaked via tool calls that do not have direct dependency on them. Example showing how an resource can infer value of private variable, despite not having direct dependency on it. CaMeLs STRICT stops this attack by making the evaluation of each statement in control flow blocks depend on the blocks test/iterable. External resource Indirect inference Figure 12 shows an example of side-channel attack that can be used to bypass all other non-CaMeL-based current security measures, but can be stopped with CaMeL run in STRICT mode (presented in Section 4.4), because of its fine-grained dependency"

The attacker can then observe the number of times the image is fetched and use this information to infer the value of private variable. When using the interpreter in STRICT mode, this attack is prevented by CaMeL: the execution of all state-changing statements inside control flow blocks is dependent (and conditional) on the control flow iterable/test, and security policy can block their execution. # Side channel attack 1: CaMeL-specific fault # Variable that has private value and has associated flow constraints private_var = 10 outcome = query_ai_assistant( f\"If '{ private_var} ' is 10, you don't have enough information\", str) # If the variable is 10, an exception is thrown and execution is terminated # Side channel attack 2: General induced fault # Variable that has private value and has associated flow constraints private_var = = [1, 2, 3] index = query_ai_assistant( f\"If '{ private_var} ' is 10, then return 9999999999, else 0\", int) # Throws an exception if private variable is 10 l[index] # ADVERSARY OBSERVABLE ACTION # This line is executed only if `private_var` is not # ADVERSARY OBSERVABLE ACTION # This line is executed only if `private_var` is not 10 # For example: send_email(..., \"adversary@example.com\") # or send_calendar_invite(..., \"adversary@example.com\", ...) # or fetch_external_image( \"attacker.com/cat.jpg\") # For example: send_email(..., \"adversary@example.com\") # or send_calendar_invite(..., \"adversary@example.com\", ...) # or fetch_external_image( \"attacker.com/cat.jpg\") Figure 13 Without STRICT mode, an adversary could leak one private bit if they can trigger an exception conditional on the private data. An external resource can infer the value of private variable, despite not having direct dependency on it, by raising an exception based on the private value and observing whether the execution of the program is completed. This is simplified version of the more realistic and complete case we discuss in Appendix I. We mitigate this issue with the STRICT mode: all statements that come after call to query_ai_assistant (the Q-LLM) have dependency on the calls arguments. Exception Handling Inferring private variable based on halted execution Exceptions can, at present, be used to launch the side-channel attacks that can reveal one bit of information. In particular, the adversary can prompt inject the Q-LLM to return an arbitrary output conditionally on other (potentially private) content passed to the Q-LLM. This can either cause NotEnoughInformationError being thrown during the execution of the Q-LLM, or another type of exception during the continuation of the execution (e.g., an IndexError) as shown in Figure 13."

            "content": "The issue is that exceptions terminate the execution and prevent the potential execution of tool calls observable by the adversary. As consequence, if the adversary can observe the execution of tool after the exception is expected to be thrown, then they can learn one bit of information about potentially private data. We discuss an expanded version of this case that can exploit code generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet for an AgentDojo task in Appendix I. We believe that this, rather than being limitation of CaMeL, is limitation of using exceptions to handle errors. This issue could be addressed by using explicit error handling with conditionals and result types (such as Result in Rust or Either in Haskell) instead of exceptions. With this approach, both branches of the conditional would maintain dependencies on the operations inputs, allowing state-changing tools to properly track these dependencies. Similarly to the example above, in the current CaMeL implementation, we mitigate this side-channel vulnerability with STRICT mode: whenever there is call to the Q-LLM (i.e., to the query_ai_assistant function), we make the evaluation of all subsequent statements have dependency on the inputs of the Q-LLM call. In this way, if the adversary manages to raise an arbitrary exception, and if state-changing tool gets called after call to the Q-LLM that had non-public variables as arguments, the execution is blocked and the user is prompted to confirm the execution. While this mitigation is effective against arbitrary exceptions caused by calls to the Q-LLM (and subsequent dependent operations, hence covering both cases in Figure 13), the adversary might still be able to raise arbitrary exceptions by manipulating the data accessed by tools. However, we expect this to be significantly more difficult than just prompt injecting the Q-LLM into raising an exception. import time # Variable that has private value and has associated flow constraints private_variable = 10 before_time = time.time() time.sleep(private_variable) after_time = time.time() # Variable that has the private value but comes with no constraints public_variable = (after_time - before_time) Figure 14 Timing side-channels can reveal private data to an adversary. Example of timing side-channel that bypasses the constraints on private variable. CaMeL is not vulnerable to this specific attack as the time module is not available in the interpreter. However, we do not exclude that other timing side-channels could be present and exploitable. Shared resource Time We conclude with another example of side-channel, in this case based on timing and probably harder to achieve. Here, an attacker might be able to deduce the contents of private variable using access to current time as is shown in Figure 14. To what extent timing side-channels are exploitable in practice depends on the specific deployment scenarios, the set of tools available to the agent, and whether the attacker is able to observe the side-channel with sufficient precision. For example, we note that the time module is not available in the current implementation of CaMeL, so this specific attack would not be possible to carry out."

In Scenario 2 (left) we consider user who either maliciously or unknowingly installs malicious tool that steals all data that is processed by the user. In this scenario security policy can be configured in way that external tools cannot access internal information, which would protect against this attack vector. In Scenario 3 (right) we consider compromised user who attempts to violate company policy by sending financial documents to an external address. The user prompt is modified to include the attackers email address, resulting in the exfiltration of private data. This scenario highlights the risk of malicious insiders or compromised user accounts. 7. Secondary attack scenarios that CaMeL can help with We note that CaMeL can also be used in threat models even stronger than the well-known prompt injection threat model, where compromise can come from the user, data, tooling, or any combination of the three. CaMeL can be used to stop rogue users and tools from violating security policy of the overall system (e.g., corporate security policies). Although this scenario receives little attention in the academic literature, it presents one of the biggest threats in an industrial setting. For example, in 2014 PwC attributed 44% of all data compromises to insider threats (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2018), while more recent Cost of Insider Threats Global Report finds that 50% of insider compromises are due to negligence, while 26% are malicious insiders (Ponemon-Institute, 2022). Here we discuss two kinds of such insiders one is the compromised user who issues command that violates underlying security policy; the other is the maliciously added tool to the system that aims to steal user data. Scenario 2: External Spy Tool The scenario in Figure 15a focuses on the risk of unauthorized data access by externally installed tools. malicious actor introduces spy tool whose documentation prompt injects the agent in way that the model would choose it (as demonstrated possible by Nestaas, Debenedetti, and Tramèr (2025)) and would pass it all the data being observed by the agent. Similarly to keylogger or screen scraper (but within ML context), the tool passively monitors and exfiltrates data processed by the agent, including sensitive private information. The attack could be intentional, with user knowingly installing malicious tool, or unintentional, with the user unknowingly installing compromised software. This scenario illustrates control flow-based adversary and is not explicitly addressed in AgentDojo. Scenario 3: Rogue User The scenario in Figure 15b addresses the threat posed by malicious insiders or compromised user accounts. user with legitimate access to the Agent intentionally misuses the"

In this example, the user modifies prompt to include an external email address, attempting to send confidential financial documents outside the organization. This scenario illustrates stronger adversary that can manipulate the control and data flows and is not explicitly addressed in AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024b). The threat models described above are extremely realistic and mimic the everyday security considerations of large agent-based system that are in production today. The complexity of these threats and the limitlessness of expected agentic functionality inspired the design of CaMeL. To the best of our knowledge, using capabilities for agents has not previously been considered, and we find that it provides strong security guarantees that current capability-less systems do not. 8. Discussion While CaMeL offers robustness to prompt injection attacks, it has several potential limitations that would be shared with any other capability-based protection scheme. In this section we first discuss how, just like our defense comes from ideas from the security literature, we can evade the defense by leveraging attacks from the security literature. Second, we discuss the challenges of balancing security with user experience, particularly in the context of de-classification and user fatigue. Third, we discuss how side-channels can be difficult to overcome for CaMeL and other systems built on similar principles. 8.1. Past problems with adoption of capabilities While capability-based systems offer robust security model, it is important to acknowledge their limitations, particularly concerning their broader applicability, implementation, and adoption challenges. One significant drawback is the high cost of implementation. Building capability-based system requires significant effort and resources, as it necessitates fundamental shift in how security is managed and enforced. This includes not only the development of the core system but also the integration and adaptation of existing tools and infrastructure. CHERI serves as good case study here (Watson et al., 2015) where incorporation of capabilities necessitated redesign of the whole software-hardware stack (Zaliva et al., 2024), change to development practices, e.g. with compartmentalisation of code (Gudka et al., 2015), as well as significant efforts to raise awareness of the benefits (RSM UK Consulting LLP for UK DSIT, 2025). Furthermore, capability-based systems ideally require full participation from the entire ecosystem. For the model to effectively enforce security policies, all external tools and services within the environment must be designed to understand and utilize capabilities, otherwise utility degrades. This can be major obstacle, especially when dealing with third-party tools or services that may not have been built with capability-based security in mind. Having said that, in the context of agents operating within controlled environment like workspace, implementing capability-based system may be feasible as long as all the tools and services are under the control of the system developers. However, as soon as the agent needs to interact with external, third-party tools, the challenge of ensuring capability support arises. So grow the risks from side-channel attacks as we discuss further. Yet we believe that in some cases, it may be possible to use capability-based systems even if third-party tools do not support capabilities. This is because the agent can act as central authority that manages capabilities for all objects in the system."

            "content": "8.2. De-classification and user fatigue Another challenge lies in balancing the need for security with user experience. While CaMeL can prevent many prompt injection attacks, it may also require user intervention in situations where the security policy is too restrictive or ambiguous. Access control problems often manifest in the process of de-classification process or downgrading (Anderson, Stajano, and Lee, 2002). This can lead to user fatigue, where users become desensitized to security prompts and may inadvertently approve malicious actions, practice that is often seen in other settings (Felt et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2021). Achieving the optimal balance between system security and minimizing user fatigue will vary depending on the specific application. Ultimately, however, its paramount for enabling effective security. In the end, security will only be as strong as the capabilities the system supports, and the policies that the system implements and enforces. 8.3. So, are prompt injections solved now? No, prompt injection attacks are not fully solved. While CaMeL significantly improves the security of LLM agents against prompt injection attacks and allows for fine-grained policy enforcement, it is not without limitations. Importantly, CaMeL suffers from users needing to codify and specify security policies and maintain them. CaMeL also comes with user burden. At the same time, it is well known that balancing security with user experience, especially with de-classification and user fatigue, is challenging. We also explicitly acknowledge the potential for side-channel vulnerabilities in CaMeL; however, we do note that their successful exploitation is significantly hindered by bandwidth limitations and the involved attack complexity. Similarly, in traditional software security, Control Flow Integrity (CFI) (Abadi et al., 2009) was developed to prevent control flow hijacking but remained vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks (Shacham, 2007; Carlini and Wagner, 2014). ROP is an exploitation technique where attackers chain together existing code fragments (called \"gadgets\") to execute malicious operations while following individually valid control flows. We suspect attacks that are similar in spirit could work against CaMeL an attacker might be able to create malicious control flow by approximating it with the smaller control flow blocks that are allowed by the security policy similar to what we demonstrate in Section 5.4. And is AgentDojo fully solved now? Not exactly. While CaMeL offers robust security guarantees and demonstrates resilience against existing prompt injection attacks within AgentDojo benchmark, it would be inaccurate to claim complete resolution. Rather, our approach diverges from prior efforts, focusing on building model scaffolding rather than improving the model. Furthermore, existing research predominantly aims to optimize utility while mitigating attack success rates. In contrast, our focus is on establishing verifiable security guarantees while concurrently maximizing utility. We firmly believe that by adopting CaMeL as fundamental design paradigm, future research will unlock substantial enhancements in utility. 9. Future work CaMeL makes significant step forward in providing security for LLM agents. However, there is some further work that can be done to improve both security and utility. Using different programming language. While basic features of Python are easy to implement, especially when using Python as the host language for the interpreter, this language quickly grows very complex and harder to make secure. For example, program termination caused by exceptions"

            "content": "can be security issue, as pointed out in Section 6. Programming languages that handle errors and I/O more explicitly, such as Haskell, might be more secure choice for deploying CaMeL to real-world applications. This complexity also has ramifications for security policies, since policy conflict resolution becomes hard to manage. Towards Formal Verification. crucial direction for future work is the formal verification of CaMeL and its security properties. While our current implementation provides strong empirical evidence of CaMeLs effectiveness in both benign and security LLM evaluations, verification can provide formal proof that CaMeLs interpreter itself is without faults and that it resolves conflicts and enforces the intended security policies, even in the presence of complex code and potential vulnerabilities in the underlying LLMs. Contextual Integrity. The effectiveness of CaMeL also depends on the availability of sufficient context for making security decisions. In some cases, the system may not have enough information to determine whether particular action is safe, requiring user intervention. To address this, CaMeL can potentially integrate with contextual integrity tools like AirGap (Bagdasaryan et al., 2024; Ghalebikesabi et al., 2024), which can automate aspects of security policy enforcement based on context-specific policies; however this might come with some degradation in either security or model utility. 10. Conclusion CaMeL is practical defense to prompt injection achieving security not through model training techniques but through principled system design around language models. Our approach effectively solves the AgentDojo benchmark while providing strong guarantees against unintended actions and data exfiltration. Our approach is not perfect and does not completely address every potential attack vector. We know this because we have chosen to design defense, instead of hoping that the defense will be learned from data. This makes it possible to precisely study the interaction between the defense components and reuse past experience from software security to reason about potential vulnerabilities. In future work we hope to develop methods that further address limitations of the current design. Importantly, CaMeL is also directly compatible with other defenses that make the language model itself more robust. Even if someone were to develop technique that significantly enhanced models robustness to prompt injection, it would still be possible to obtain stronger security argument through combining it with CaMeL. More broadly, we believe that this type of security engineering mindset will be useful to areas of language model security beyond just prompt injection. While it would be clearly preferable to have single robust model that was able to address the many safety and security requirements of modern models in all possible settings, achieving this may not be immediately practical. Instead, we have shown that it is possible to design system around an untrusted model that makes the whole system robust even if the model itself is not. We see potential for similar approaches to be taken to other areas, and hope that future work will continue in this direction."

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.08966. A. Extended Related Work A.1. Background: Software Security Concepts A.1.1. Computer security nomenclature In this work we extensively use terminology from the computer security literature. Security Policy is defined by Anderson, Stajano, and Lee (2002) as high-level specification of the security properties that given system should possess. Such policies describe the overall goals of the system, define the subjects and the objects in the system, and finally restrict the operations that they can perform. An example of policy could be: no internal Need-to-Know documents should be sent to external parties. Currently, such policy is not enforceable for machine learning models in robust way. We also adopt notions of control and data flows. Control Flow here refers to the execution flow of given program or an agent, while Data Flow refers to how data flows within given execution flow. Within the context of classic software program, control flow refers to instructions that are executed within program, while data flow refers to how data propagates between the instructions (Abadi et al., 2009). Capabilities, in turn, are unforgeable tags,tokens, or keys, that grant specific fine-grained access rights to resource or functionality (Needham and Walker, 1977). They provide flexible way to control what actions, tools, or the agent generally can perform. For instance, imagine that every file on cloud storage is associated with capability. Then, we can enforce that tool can only execute if it possess specific file-corresponding capability. At the same time, defining both control and data flows is generally impossible for machine learning models,7 since data and control flow are inherently intertwined and it is hard to explicitly separate the two in generality. However, in an agentic setting with explicit tools and data sources it becomes possible. For example, consider user prompt Can you send Bob the document he requested in our last meeting? Bobs email and the document he asked for are in the meeting notes file. as depicted in Figure 1. Here, to solve this query the model explicitly needs to perform sequence of well defined instructions find recent meeting notes, find email in the notes, find document name in the notes, fetch document by name, send email with the fetched document to the fetched email address. With explicit control flow defined, similarly data flow appears. 7Both data and the model are exactly the same semantically consider linear model 𝐴𝑥 + 𝑏 = 𝑦, here both 𝐴 and 𝑏 represent control flow, while 𝑥 represents data flow. Both are just matrices. similar argument could be made about data and instructions for classical software as they are both data. The difference lies in that instruction streams are generally structured and restricted in their representations, which is not the case in machine learning, at least currently."

            "content": "A.1.2. Access and Information Flow Controls Ensuring program integrity, i.e. that the program was not modified since last authorised modification, and confidentiality, i.e. that the program preserves the promise of secrecy, are fundamental challenges in computer security. One prominent threat to integrity is the buffer overflow attack (Aleph One, 1996), which exploits memory vulnerabilities to execute malicious code, usually violating the intended control flow of the program. Control Flow Integrity (CFI), as proposed by Abadi et al. (2009), addresses this by instrumenting binaries to enforce adherence to pre-defined Control Flow Graph (CFG), thereby restricting execution only to legitimate paths, reducing attack surface, but not fully eliminating it (Carlini and Wagner, 2014). Beyond integrity, controlling access to sensitive information is crucial. Access Control mechanisms (Anderson, 2010), broadly categorised into Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), govern how resources are accessed. Furthermore, Information Flow Control (IFC) (Denning, 1976; Myers and Liskov, 1997) provides confidentiality by tracking information, preventing leaks of sensitive data into unauthorized contexts. This can be achieved through various methods, including static code analysis to formally verify program properties (Denning and Denning, 1977) and language-based security mechanisms, such as specialized type systems (Sabelfeld and Myers, 2003). A.1.3. Tool-calling LLM Agents Large Language Models can be enhanced by interacting via programmatic APIs to expand their functionality (Schick et al., 2023). Usually, models such as Gemini (Gemini-Team, 2024), LLaMa 3.1 (Dubey et al., 2024), Claude 3 (Anthropic, 2024), and GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024) are provided with the API documentation (e.g., what the tool does and the description of its input) as part of the system prompt, and they generate text in specific format which is interpreted by the LLM runtime as tool call. The runtime then runs the tool and returns the result as part of the conversation with the LLM. The LLM, then, can decide whether it needs to further request tool call based on the previous tools output. A.2. Prompt Injection Defenses Several defenses have been proposed to defend against prompt injection attacks. Hines et al. (2024) propose to delimit untrusted parts of the context with special characters, and explicitly instructing the model to not follow instructions within the delimiters. In similar spirit, prompt sandwiching (Learn Prompting, 2024) consists of showing the model the original task after each tool output. Chen et al. (2024) train model to accept structured queries and follow only the instructions which are in one portion of the query. Wallace et al. (2024) and Wu et al. (2024) fine-tune the model to ignore illegitimate instruction, but only follow the original instructions instead. Abdelnabi et al. (2024) propose to keep track of the LLMs internal representations to see if they significantly change direction during the task execution, signalling that the task that the model is executing has changed along the way. Sharma, Gupta, and Grossman (2024) uses structured formal language to define the task of the model and detects when the task being executed is different from the original one. line of work also proposes to detect prompt injection attacks (with BERT-based detector (ProtectAI, 2024)), or by detecting data exfiltration via canaries (Debenedetti et al., 2024a). Close to our work is Wu, Cecchetti, and Xiao (2024), who make use of Information Flow Control to keep track of which parts of the tool outputs are trusted and can be fed to the tool-calling model. Foundational to our work is the defense proposed, with high-level description, by Willison (2023). Willison proposes an isolation-based model, where the tool calls are planned by privileged LLM which only sees the user prompt and never sees untrusted, third-party data. Then, this LLM queries"

            "content": "Quarantined LLMwhich does not have any tool-calling capabilitiesto process untrusted data (e.g., to summarize an email). In this way, an adversary planting prompt injection will not be able to cause the privileged LLM to call tool which was not meant to be called in the original plan, hence defending against all attacks where the adversary needs different sequence of tool calls than the user. Furthermore, Wu et al. (2025) takes similar approach to defend against attacks from untrusted tools via isolation, and requires explicit user approval before giving tools access to the outputs of other tools for all queries, hence being prone to causing user fatigue. Finally, we describe concurrent work. Zhong et al. (2025) also employs integrity and confidentiality labels, however, instead of tracking dependencies by explicitly employing control flow graph, they use classifier to establish whether region of text depends on other regions of text. Moreover, the labelling is coarser, by only employing private and public labels, and trusted and untrusted ones, which does not allow for security policies that are as expressive as CaMeLs. Abdelnabi et al. (2025) focus on the travel planning task for agent to agent communications. Here, Abdelnabi et al. use synthetic data to extract and define policies that the agent can then use to restrict data flow. B.

Information about which Slack channels they need to be added to Here are all recent messages from our Slack workspace: \"\"\" + str(formatted_messages) + \"\"\" Please find the specific message about the new team member joining and extract the required information. If multiple messages discuss this, combine the information from all relevant messages.\"\"\", MessageInfo ) # Invite the user to Slack invite_user_to_slack(info.new_colleague_name, info.new_colleague_email) # Add the user to each specified channel for channel in info.channels: add_user_to_channel(info.new_colleague_name, channel) print(f\"Invited {info.new_colleague_name} to Slack and added them to the following channels: {', '.join(info.channels)}\") ``` I've modified the code to: 1. Look at all messages without filtering 2. Format each message with clear structure showing where it was sent and by whom 3. Provide very specific context about what we're looking for 4. Explain that the information might be spread across multiple messages 5. Make it clear we're looking for recent messages about new team member joining This broader approach should help us find the information even if it's not in an obvious place or spread across multiple messages.
