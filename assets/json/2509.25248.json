            "content": "Imagine that you are graduate student during rebuttal period. The reviewers strongly suggested that you compare your system with prior work. It was only published few years ago, so you find the GitHub repo, download the code, and read the included docs. It doesnt compile. The dependency URLs are missing. Required libraries arent included. Even if it worked perfectly when first published, its going to take you days to even compile this system. This scenario highlights the difficulty of compiling once-maintained open-source code, and in fact this problem is faced by the broader software engineering community. However, recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to improve various software engineering tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021). While commercial software can be developed with stringent and consistent engineering practices, OSS projects are highly heterogeneous. Additionally, OSS projects are maintained by varied contributors, adopt various build frameworks, and frequently require platform-specific configurations. Compiling OSS often requires manual intervention to resolve missing dependencies, version mismatches, or undocumented environment requirements. Although prior rule-based methods (e.g., GHCC (Hu, 2020) and Assemblage (Liu et al., 2024)) attempted to automate this process by iteratively 1 Figure 1: Demonstration of rule-based and AI agentic compilation methods. While rule-based methods follow predefined workflow, they cannot adequately adapt to different environments. In comparison, AI agents leverage their pre-trained knowledge to adjust the compilation commands based on execution results. In this example, the agent realizes LIBEVENT is key missing dependency for Bitcoin to compile and installs it to successfully compile the project. invoking build scripts, they cannot robustly handle dependency, toolchain, or platform mismatches. These challenges impact human software engineers who integrate OSS into their own applications, as this requires compilation to turn the software into library or binary that they can use in their own system. Reliable and scalable automated compilation, in addition to improving software engineering, has other research benefits: It enables large-scale usage of binary data sources, supports program analysis and vulnerability discovery, and accelerates software maintenance workflows (Lacomis et al., 2019; Dramko et al., 2023; Pal et al., 2024). This work addresses these challenges by using LLM-based agents to automate OSS compilation at scale. LLMs that are pre-trained on large amount of natural language data exhibit strong performance in general-purpose tasks, even with zero-shot prompting (Kojima et al., 2023). This capability is generalized to software engineering-related tasks, such as code generation, software debugging, documentation generation, and code refactoring. As such, LLM-based AI agents (Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023), which are autonomous systems that use LLMs to iteratively plan, reason, and act, are increasingly used to automate and facilitate complex software engineering workflows (Wang et al., 2024). In this context, we position OSS compilation as challenging and underexplored target for LLM-based agents. We are thus motivated to create benchmark (BUILD-BENCH) and systematically evaluate various, specifically agentic, solutions. BUILD-BENCH includes 148 humanly verified repositories out of 385 randomly selected C/C++-heavy OSS from GitHub, each manually annotated for compilation success and build instruction retrieval. We use an additional 70 carefully chosen projects as validation set to support the development of our agentic baseline method, OSS-BUILD-AGENT. Using BUILD-BENCH, we evaluate existing rule-based and LLM baselines and agentic compilation methods. We showcase the current shortcoming of rule-based methods in compilation performance and success verification. For LLM and agentic compilation methods, we inspect in detail the performance discrepancy of various compilation system designs. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our LLM-Assisted Retrieval and Multi-Agent Compilation module design through side-by-side comparison to another agentic solution. Through the release of BUILD-BENCH and our analysis, we encourage researchers to create better agentic solutions for the compilation task, which will ultimately benefit the AI, software engineering, and software security communities. Contributions. Our contributions are as follows: We created BUILD-BENCH, which is benchmark that contains both hand-picked validation set and randomly sampled test set with manual inspection and labeling to support rigorous and systematic evaluation of different OSS compilation techniques. 2 We evaluated the performance of five rule-based and AI build methods on BUILD-BENCH, including two agentic methods. Our proposed OSS-BUILD-AGENT achieved the best performance, surpassing the strongest rule-based baseline by roughly 50%. With strong base LLM, OSS-BUILD-AGENT reached 66.4% success rate, establishing strong baseline performance, while BUILD-BENCH remains challenge for future research. We offered detailed inspection of various design approaches in compilation instruction retrieval and error resolution modules and their effects on task performance."

            "title": "2 CONSTRUCTING BUILD-BENCH",
            "content": "A benchmark for automated OSS compilation requires representative dataset of OSS. We first analyze the prior work COMPILEAGENTBENCH (Hu et al., 2025), which also targets the automatic compilation task. Specifically, it consists of 100 popular and well-known GitHub projects, averaging over 8,000 stars. However, this focus on popular repositories overlooks the vast majority of OSS: 99.88% of C/C++ projects on GitHub have fewer than 500 stars. Therefore, the generalizability of evaluation results on COMPILEAGENTBENCH may be undermined by projects that are unusually well documented, well maintained, and less representative of the in-the-wild challenges. Data Filtering. Therefore, we strive to create BUILD-BENCH as statistically representative benchmark to ensure generalizability to the broad diversity of OSS. To create the raw dataset, we collected 2.77M and 4.23M C++ repositories from GitHub RESTAPI with date range between April 1st, 2008 to January 1st, 2024. To remove extremely low-quality repositories, we apply few filters: We exclude projects with names or descriptions that contained certain keywords (e.g., homework or assignment, more in Appendix A) or have stargazer count below 50 to ensure the OSS are meaningful for both practical usage and research purposes. For deduplication, we excluded repositories that are forks of other repositories. After filtering, the raw dataset contains 6.57M repositories. From this population, we randomly select 385 projects, the minimum sample size required to measure population proportion with 95% confidence with margin of error of 5%, according to Cochran (1977) (details in Appendix B). We believe that this randomly sampling helps ensure that BUILD-BENCH better approximates real-world OSS compilation challenges. Data Selection and Labeling by Human Experts. Due to the random sampling process, we cannot guarantee that all of the 385 projects can be compiled. Therefore, human experts manually built each repository to determine its validity. We also exclude OSS repositories that fit into following criteria: (a) The repository targets another operating system and cannot be cross-compiled; (b) The repository only contains trivial or unbuildable content; (c) The repository is missing critical source files and broken dependencies that cannot be installed or created; (d) There are compilation and linking errors that human experts cannot resolve in best-effort setting. This process resulted in 148 compilable repositories as the final test set. Additionally, we manually created ground truth labels for compiled binary file names and URLs where the build instructions are hosted, if provided by the developers. The manual labeling involved 12 graduate students with more than 3 years of experience working on system research, and took roughly 150 hours. Figure 2: Distribution of stargazer counts of BUILD-BENCH and COMPILEAGENTBENCH. Note that in BUILD-BENCH, relatively lowprofile repositories made up the majority of the samples. We also created validation set of 70 popular repositories used to evaluate OSS-BUILD-AGENT. The representativeness (or diversity) of benchmark for compilation task is essential to evaluate the generalizability and performance of any compilation technique. We analyze the representativeness from two following aspects: popularity distribution and build system distribution. 3 Popularity. The number of Stargazers (or stars) of GitHub repository is often used to approximate popularity and perceived quality (Dramko et al., 2023). higher number often correlates with popular or essential functionality, better code quality, and an active development community that supports continuous and frequent maintenance. However, majority of repositories tend to have relatively lower stars compared to high-profile projects such as OpenSSL or FFmpeg. This is partially because repositories are often created for specific use cases and targeting smaller and specialized audience groups instead of having widely applicable use cases. Meanwhile, most repositories are for personal or experimental use, further undermining their limited visibility. Figure 2 shows the Stargazer counts of repositories in BUILD-BENCH and COMPILEAGENTBENCH. Most repositories in BUILD-BENCH are in the 50500 range, indicating random selection results coincide with the long-tail distribution of overall repository popularity. This characteristic makes BUILD-BENCH more challenging for evaluating compilation techniques, because low-profile repositories often lack documentation or require additional customization or configuration. In contrast, the Stargazer counts of COMPILEAGENTBENCH repositories are aggregated between 2k and 10k, and these popular repositories might be considered as an underestimation of the true difficulty of the compilation task. Build Systems. We further analyze the build systems and tool chains used in BUILD-BENCH repositories: 62 projects use Make, 60 use CMake, 29 use Autotools, and 14 use Visual Studio (MSBuild). Smallerbut non-negligible subsetsadopt alternative systems such as custom scripts, QMake, Meson, etc. 10 repositories provide no explicit build system, often relying on direct compilation. This diversity showcases the heterogeneity of real-world OSS, where the build system selection often depends on the project domain, platform, and community preference. Note that there may be multiple build systems available in the same OSS, which offers alternative compilation approaches. Overall, the results show that BUILD-BENCH adequately represents wide variety of real-world and C++ projects and is suitable as benchmark for evaluating of automated build techniques."

            "title": "3 AGENTIC BUILDING METHODS",
            "content": "We create an agentic compilation technique, OSS-BUILD-AGENT. As Figure 3 shows, an initial (and optional) LLM iteratively extends the README with additional compilation instructions, then multi-agent build system iteratively generates and executes compilation steps. 3.1 COMPILATION INSTRUCTION RETRIEVAL Many repositories with complex build processes or that require specialized configurations tend to document these steps for human developers. Accessing these instructions is crucial because they provide agents with helpful information regarding necessary setup and configuration steps. However, we find that this documentation is not only located in the OSS repositorys README, but can also be located in other files in the repository or on another website. To solve this challenge we propose an LLM-Assisted Retrieval module, an optional component that precedes OSS-BUILDAGENT. Our approach uses an out-of-box LLM as an incremental retriever to synthesize the complete set of instructions required for compiling given repository. The process uses the projects README as input. The LLM then iteratively performs three operations: (i) it distills potential compilation instructions from the file, (ii) it evaluates the sufficiency of the acquired information, and (iii) if the information is not sufficient enough to support compilation, it identifies promising links, encompassing both internal files and external web pages. The contents of up to three newly identified links are subsequently fetched, summarized, and re-evaluated. This recursive process of retrieval and refinement continues until the LLMs confidence in the completeness of the build knowledge is fulfilled or maximum of three iterations is reached. The output of this is the final compilation instructions. Figure 3: OSS-BUILD-AGENT system diagram. The initial input is the README, then an optional LLM extends this with additional compilation instructions. Finally, multi-agent build system iteratively generates and executes compilation steps, attempting to compile the target repository. 3.2 MULTI-AGENT COMPILATION SYSTEM The compilation system comprises two cooperating agents, both using an out-of-the-box LLM of the users selection: Bash Command Generator is given the final compilation instructions from the prior module (if using LLM-Assisted Retrieval) and the repository as input and produces candidate sequence of bash commands to compile the repository. Execution Agent runs these commands within containerized environment and returns the execution results. Prompts are included in Appendix Section C.2 and C.3. For refinement steps = 0, . . . , K, let Ck be the input into Bash Command Generator, which produces Sk, the commands to be executed by Execution Agent in the environment that returns execution results fk. Initialization. Bash Command Generator produces the first set of commands directly from the input prompt C0 because there is no execution feedback. Execution Agent runs generated commands S0 in fresh Docker container, yielding the initial execution results f0. Iterative Error Resolution. This constitutes the standard agentic loop: Bash Command Generator uses both Ck and the latest execution results fk to craft revised commands Sk, which the Execution Agent then executes again. The process ends when Success(fk) = true or when = K, exceeding the maximum turns allowed. This iterative error resolution process enables the compilation to recover from missing dependencies, incorrect flags, or environmental mismatches, an ability that is required for OSS compilation task, as we analyzed in Section 6."

            "title": "4 BASELINE METHODS",
            "content": "In this section, we present existing rule-based techniques as well as two LLM-based compilation methods we compare against. GHCC. GHCC (Hu, 2020) is rule-based tool for building GitHub repositories. Prior research uses datasets that GHCC created (Lacomis et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2024). Given repository, GHCC attempts to build the project by first discovering all build system-specific files (e.g., Makefile and CMakeLists.txt) and then conducting rule-based build routine customized for these build systems. 5 Assemblage. Assemblage (Liu et al., 2024) is system designed to automate the construction of binary datasets of primarily Windows executables by building source code. It follows similar rule-based compilation workflow as GHCC. Single-turn LLM baseline. To evaluate the project-building performance of pretrained LLMs on single-turn basis, we prompt an out-of-the-box LLM to generate set of Bash commands to build target repository and execute the commands in Docker container. The input to this baseline is the README file and file directory of the OSSs root directory. Without any execution feedback, this single-turn baseline cannot adjust its initial output. (Prompt in Appendix C.1.) CompileAgent. CompileAgent (Hu et al., 2025) also introduces multi-agentic compilation system. It adopts flow-based agent strategy in which master agent orchestrates the build process across two core modules: (1) CompileNavigator for locating and extracting build instructions and (2) ErrorSolver for resolving compilation errors. These modules are supported by five specialized tools (shell execution, file navigation, instruction extraction, web search, and multi-agent discussion), four of which involve auxiliary LLM agents, totaling seven agents in the pipeline. We include its official open-source implementation as baseline in our evaluation to provide representative comparison against our agentic approaches."

            "title": "5 EXPERIMENT SETUP AND EVALUATION METHODS",
            "content": "We evaluate the performance of baseline build techniques and OSS-BUILD-AGENT on BUILDBENCH. We implement single-turn LLM baseline with two base models: GPT o3-mini and Claude 3.7-Sonnet. For OSS-BUILD-AGENT, we use five models, representing diverse characteristics including reasoning vs. non-reasoning, generic vs. coding-specific, and different parameter sizes. For CompileAgent we use GPT-4o as the main base model as its implementation indicates. All build methods build each repository in fresh Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container, with minimal packages pre-installed. Success Metrics. key evaluation challenge is to determine if build method successfully builds given repository. Existing build methods determine the compilation process as Completion with the presence of at least one binary post-building. This metric is unreliable when (1) failed building process generates intermediate binary files, or (2) submodule (or vendored package) successfully builds while the main repository fails building. We improve the completion success criteria with additional validation using expert-generated, perrepository lists of binary file names as ground truth. After the building of repository completes, we compare the file names of all produced binary files against expert-generated list. We categorize success into two types: (1) Strict Success only when all binary file names in the expert-generated list exist, and (2) Flexible Success when at least one file name in our expert-generated list exists."

For rule-based methods, GHCC achieves 30.2% completions and 13.4% flexible validated successes, outperforming Assemblage. Single-turn LLM baselines results vary: o3-mini exhibits degraded performance, while Claude 3.7-Sonnet is surprisingly strong for non-agent setting (21.5% strict; 22.1% flexible). Moreover, the performance of COMPILEAGENT suffers substantial drop from 89% strict validated success on COMPILEAGENTBENCH to 49.7% strict and 55.7% flexible on BUILD-BENCH. This performance drop indicates pronounced distribution shift and higher difficulty of BUILD-BENCH. Agents enable compilation error resolution in multi-turn setting. OSS-BUILD-AGENT substantially outperforms all rule-based baselines. The best configuration, OSS-BUILD-AGENT with LLM-assisted Retrieval using Claude 3.7-Sonnet, reaches 66.4% strict and 71.8% flexible validated successes, gain of 49.7 percentage points over single-turn baseline with the same model. Iterative observationrepairrebuild loops allow agents to access and receive feedback from execution results, backtrack from ineffective commands, and apply targeted fixes that single-turn approaches cannot. 6 Table 1: Performance of all evaluated build techniques on BUILD-BENCH test set.

The agent framework uses out-of-the-box pre-trained LLMs, allowing our framework to be model-agnostic. Nevertheless, performance scales with model capability. Among all settings, Claude 3.7-Sonnet achieves the best performance with significant margin to the next best model. This confirms that stronger LLMs are more effective in adjusting its output based on error results and applying targeted fixes, two skills that are central to resolving complex build failures. In contrast, smaller models (e.g., o3mini) perform consistently but saturate at around 6869% flexible success, while specialized models (Qwen3 Coder) underperform (38.9% flexible), suggesting that coding specialization may become drawback, considering retrieval module challenges more on models documentation comprehension ability. Overall, the performance of OSS-BUILD-AGENT is model-agnostic, but stronger LLMs still improve the performance of OSS-BUILD-AGENT. 6.1 INSTABILITY AND REPEATED EXPERIMENTS Table 2: Results from three repeated runs of OSS-BUILD-AGENT with retrieval using GPT-4o. refers to the order in Figure 4. Error Fixing attempts is the average of attempts across all repositories in one run. Instability in agentic frameworks is well-recognized issue (Yao et al., 2024). Although OSS-BUILD-AGENT performs strongly, its results fluctuate over runs. To quantify this, we repeat experiments with GPT-4o, non-reasoning model, as the base model in three independent runs. Table 2 shows the results, where OSS-BUILD-AGENT achieves 53.0% 6.8 strict and 57.6% 6.5 flexible validated success, indicating nontrivial variance. We attribute this to two major factors. First, LLM-guided retrieval can follow different documentation accessing trajectories and produce different build recipes across runs, shifting the subsequent compilation trajectories. Second, LLM outputs are nondeterministic even with identical prompts (Song et al., 2024), and this randomness compounds over multi-turn interactions. Together, these effects lead to instability. Error Fixing Attempts = 2 = 1 = 3 Flexible Success % Strict Success % 50.3 59.5 62.9 45.6 54.7 58.8 4.8 6.9 8.4 Additionally, we evaluate pass@k across three runs to assess the benefit of multiple attempts (Figure 4). For the strict setting, the pass rates increase from 54.7% at pass@1 to 59.5% at pass@2 and 65.5% at pass@3. Under the flexible setting, the corresponding rates are higher, rising from 59.5% to 64.2% and 70.3%. These results demonstrate that multiple agentic trials substantially improve performance, which may better control the stochastic nature of AI agents. Repeated experiments not only control for performance variance, but also help to validate the arguments based on performance."

            "title": "6.2 RETRIEVAL AND ERROR RESOLUTION",
            "content": "Despite the architectural differences between COMPILEAGENT and OSS-BUILD-AGENT, they both incorporate two similar modules of build instruction retrieval and agentic error resolution. We discuss the system design differences and their performance impact. Retrieval Analysis. Accurate retrieval of build instructions has strong impact on subsequent compilation performance. Developer-provided instructions offer solid starting point that agents can adapt to match specific configuration requirements or environment differences. In BUILD-BENCH, we identified 130 OSS repositories from BUILD-BENCH test set with clear URL labels for the build instruction. Together, these form secondary benchmark for evaluating the retrieval module described in Section 3.1. We evaluate COMPILEAGENT on the 130 OSS repositories with URL labels along with OSSBUILD-AGENTs LLM-Assisted Retrieval (both using GPT-4o), using the same criteria for success: whether the retrieval module accessed the ground-truth URL that hosts the build instruction for the given repository. In our evaluation, the retrieval module of OSS-BUILD-AGENT achieved retrieval accuracy of 73.8%, significantly outperforming COMPILEAGENTs 46.2%. We attribute this performance improvement to key design choices in our retrieval module. We observe that COMPILEAGENTs retrieval tool favors certain files or pages and often avoids less obvious links, leading to missed instructions. For example, when given the structure of the root directory of repository, agents usually pick build scripts (e.g., Makefile) as the retrieval target. Unfortunately, build scripts are often too noisy and can divert the agents from continuing to find explicit documentation about configuration or setup. Additionally, build instructions can exist across multiple sources (e.g., README files, wiki pages, and subdirectories), and the derailment of agents compounds when facing noises from the scattered instructions. In comparison, we design the LLM-Assisted Retrieval module of OSS-BUILD-AGENT as workflow that mimics human engineer. It focuses on exploring the documentation instead of the build process. In the first iteration of retrieval, we instruct the LLM to inspect the main README file to extract information or find useful URLs. This prevents the LLM from being distracted by build scripts. Traversing path of documentation files, our retrieval module better handles scattered information. Error Resolution Attempts. We compare two different agentic systems and manually inspect their action trajectories of error resolution. We observe that while COMPILEAGENT employs variety of tools, the main agent rarely invokes some of these tools (such as Multi-Agent Discussion for error resolution). The master agent usually exits too easily when encountering compilation errors, without attempting more fixes by invoking tools. Because compilation errors are often long, verbose, and nested, locating and fixing root-cause errors may require iterative attempts (interested readers may refer to an example in Appendix F). Thus, more error resolving attempts is favorable, which is validated by our repeated experiments with OSSBUILD-AGENT as Table 2 shows. Using the same base model, we observe that validated success rate scales well with the number of attempts to resolve the error. Figure 4: pass@k performance of OSSBUILD-AGENT with LLM-Assisted Retrieval using GPT-4o. For = 1, we report the earliest chronological run. Despite the scaling effect of error resolution attempts, OSS-BUILD-AGENT attempts 6.6 times on average, in comparison to 7.5 times in COMPILEAGENT (excluding its retrieval module for fair comparison). This difference is due to our agent outputting the entire set of build commands, while COMPILEAGENT outputs one bash command at time and refines it iteratively if execution shows error. While this fine-grained approach can be effective, it also inflates the trajectory with trivial commands (e.g., ls, mkdir) that rarely fail but still count as separate steps. Conversely, OSS-BUILDAGENT generates more complete set of compilation commands intended to drive the build to completion in single run, followed by troubleshooting if needed. This design allows the agent to observe the full command history at each step, providing contextual information for error resolution. For example (details in Appendix E), an error such as The source directory does not appear to 8 contain CMakeLists.txt can be resolved more effectively when the agent has access to prior directory navigation steps, enabling it to adjust the working directory and retry seamlessly. Together, our agentic designs in OSS-BUILD-AGENT ensure better retrieval and error resolution practices achieve better performance despite using only two agents (vs. seven in COMPILEAGENT) and simpler architectural design, showcasing the competitive performance of our end-to-end agentic compilation pipeline."

The intricacies of these languages, including discontinued maintenance, complex build systems that depend on many external dependencies, and the often less informative error messages from compilers like GCC and Clang (Onyango and Mariga, 2023), all add up to the difficulties of the task. Rule-based methods have been used extensively in previous work on building binary datasets for downstream tasks (Hu, 2020; Lacomis et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2024). While such methods suffer from their inherent fragility, AI agents may be suitable solution. As initial efforts, such as CompileAgent (Hu et al., 2025), have indicated the potential of using the agentic compilation method, the dataset against which it is evaluated consists of many well-known OSS that may have their compilation processes memorized by LLM, introducing biases to the evaluation results. We believe it is necessary to create more challenging and representative benchmark dataset that allows for more insightful evaluation and analysis of agentic compilation methods."

            "content": "One of potential drawbacks of our benchmark is the relatively small number of compilable repositories for the test set. However, we compensate for the quantity with intensive manual verification that produces ground-truth binary file and retrieval labels that facilitate both analysis and future developments. Although OSS-BUILD-AGENT shows competitive performance, we acknowledge the inherent instability of the agentic framework that may introduce variations in performance when reproducing the experiments. Also, we believe that agentic retrieval could be further enhanced with recent advancement of AI agent research, which ultimately improves the accuracy of the retrieval to enhance 9 the overall compilation performance. We also invite researchers to expand the potential of different agents design philosophies and validate them on BUILD-BENCH to facilitate real-life developers and downstream research."

Using BUILD-BENCH, we conducted rigorous evaluation of different compilation methods, including our agentic baseline OSS-BUILD-AGENT. Analysis of module designs of agentic compilation methods pinpoints the challenging nature of the compilation task and shed lights on desirable approaches. We hope that our work contributes to the community by providing suitable benchmark and inspires the community to build better agents for the task of OSS compilation."

It uses OpenCV v3 API calls and originally build to run on Ubuntu 14. Newer versions of OpenCV v4 updated their API, which causes this project to fail to build out-ofthe-box on recent versions of Ubuntu. Based on error log that Agent received as part of feedback loop, it automatically patched the source files updating the occurrences of old API and successfully compiled the repository. For instance, it updated CV LOAD IMAGE COLOR to IMREAD COLOR. It showcases the potential of AI-based compilation method of patching deemed uncompilable repositories, whereas rule-based approach would never be able to fix it automatically without human-assistance."

However, the execution failed. First, the current user running the git submodule update command is not the owner of the specified repository directory, causing dubious ownership error. Then this results in follow-up error in make that indicates No rule to make target install. To resolve the error, the agent must address the submodule initialization error, as it is the root cause.
