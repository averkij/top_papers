            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Spatial reasoning is fundamental aspect of human cognition that involves understanding spatial layouts, imagining and manipulating objects, and navigating environments. It supports applications ranging from robotics, autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality to geospatial analytics, computer graphics, humancomputer interaction, and education (Huang et al., 2024b; Qi et al., 2024; 2025). For aritificial agents, autonomous systems that perceive and act in dynamic environments, reliable spatial competence requires interpreting geometric relations, depth cues, occlusion patterns, and agent-centric perspectives in scenes that are visually noisy and structurally complex (Bar-Anan et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2025; Trope & Liberman, 2010; Ramalho et al., 2018). Recent visionlanguage models have advanced multimodal representation and language grounding, but their spatial judgments remain fragile in realistic environments (Chen et al., 2025; Kosoy et al., 2025; Pothiraj et al., 2025). 1 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 1: Overview of SPATIALAB. The benchmark addresses limitations of prior datasets (left), introduces 1,400 visual QA pairs spanning 5 categories and 30 subcategories (center), and enables systematic evaluation through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. It features diverse task and image complexity, with varied object counts, layers, lighting, textures, relations, and materials (right). Existing spatial benchmarks, however, are narrow and simplified. Most focus on elementary tasks such as binary spatial relations, low-resolution depth categories, or schematic navigation cues, often in synthetic or simplified settings that reduce visual clutter and homogenize objects (Du et al., 2024; Jia et al., 2025; Szymanska et al., 2024; Shiri et al., 2024; Kamath et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2025; Cai et al., 2024). These controlled setups lessen perceptual and reasoning demands, leading to apparent saturation while masking failures under distribution shift. Critical challenges such as robust occlusion inference, scale-consistent judgments across viewpoints, and planning under partial observability remain under-sampled (Kosoy et al., 2025; Pothiraj et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Cai et al., 2025). As result, models that perform well on existing benchmarks often fail on integrated, multi-step inference tasks, limiting safe deployment in real-world environments where spatial errors carry practical consequences. meaningful evaluation must therefore span the all core axes of spatial reasoning: relative position, depth and occlusion, orientation, size and scale, navigation, and 3D geometry. Unlike current task-isolated setups, human cognition integrates these dimensions seamlessly under noise and ambiguity (Driess et al., 2023; Brohan et al., 2023; Zitkovich et al., 2023; Collaboration et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2025). Robust benchmarks should therefore test both choice and generation, benchmark against human performance, and draw from real-world scenes that reveal failures masked by simulator datasets-principles that motivate our benchmark. To address the above needs, we introduce SPATIALAB, benchmark designed to assess spatial reasoning of visionlanguage models in realistic, unconstrained visual contexts, as outlined in Figure 1. SPATIALAB provides balanced suite of visual questionanswer items covering broad taxonomy of spatial tasks and supports both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation formats. The benchmark emphasizes photographic diversity, complex spatial relational queries, and tasks that require integrating depth, perspective, and 3D structure. We evaluate wide collection of state-of-theart VLMs, including openand closed-source models and reasoning-focused systems, compare them to human performance, and perform extensive error analysis. Our key contributions are as follows: 1. We introduce SPATIALAB, large-scale benchmark of 1,400 visual questionanswer pairs spanning six principal categories and thirty task types in realistic, unconstrained contexts. With at least 200 questions per category and 25 per subcategory, it ensures balanced coverage and supports both multiple-choice (SPATIALAB-MCQ) and open-ended (SPATIALABOPEN) evaluation. 2. We perform comprehensive evaluation of 25+ state-of-the-art visionlanguage models: openand closed-source, reasoning-oriented, and spatially specialized reasoning models against human baselines, exposing consistent and significant gap in spatial reasoning. 3. We deliver in-depth error analyses and diagnostic studies that uncover systematic failure modes in depth perception, navigation, occlusion, and 3D geometry, yielding concrete insights and actionable directions for advancing robust, human-aligned spatial understanding. 2 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 1: Comparison of spatial reasoning benchmarks.

We explore multiple strategies to enhance spatial reasoning in VLMs, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, CoT with self-reflection, and multi-agent architectures with multi-step reasoning, analyzing their benefits and limitations across multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. In the multiple-choice setting, leading models achieve roughly 5055% accuracy, while human annotators exceed 85%. In open-ended generation, model performance drops by another 1025 percentage points, with the best systems near 40% versus about 65% for humans. Error analysis reveals concentrated failures in occlusion inference, scale-consistency, and multi-step navigational planning, indicating limits in compositional spatial representations and reasoning. Our comprehensive study highlights which interventions provide robust gains, which amplify existing biases, and the critical role of perceptual grounding for generalizable spatial reasoning. By providing tasks, baseline results, and diagnostic analyses, SPATIALAB establishes foundation for progress and reproducible comparison in spatial reasoning evaluation."

            "content": "Visualspatial reasoning, the ability to perceive, represent, and manipulate spatial relations among objects, plays central role in human cognition and in enabling embodied agents to navigate and act in the world (Palmer, 1999; Chabris et al., 2006). Formally, we can describe scene as set of objects = {o1, . . . , on} with attributes (e.g., position, orientation, size) in world coordinate system . Visualspatial reasoning then seeks to learn mapping : (I, Q) (cid:55) R, where is an image (or image sequence), is linguistic query, and is structured representation of spatial relations = {r(oi, oj) oi, oj O} capturing predicates such as left-of, occludes, or supports. For visionlanguage models (VLMs), learning is highly challenging because it requires integrating noisy visual perception with compositional linguistic abstraction under embodied constraints such as perspective, gravity, and physical interaction (Dai et al., 2017; Alayrac et al., 2022). Early approaches to spatial reasoning in VLMs have largely relied on basic spatial relations or narrow task designs (Cheng et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024; Szymanska et al., 2024), often situated in synthetic datasets like CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2016) or structured questionanswering benchmarks such as GQA (Hudson & Manning, 2019) or puzzle-like simulated setups such as MGT (Stogiannidis et al., 2025) and OmniSpatial (Stogiannidis et al., 2025), as we can notice in Table 11. While useful for controlled evaluation, these settings oversimplify spatial structure, omit environmental noise, and neglect dynamic factors such as temporal changes or viewpoint shifts. To overcome these limitations, we argue for the need to benchmark spatial reasoning in rich, real-world contexts that capture scene complexity, temporal variation, and multiple perspectives. Such settings expose VLMs to challenges they would encounter in embodied or interactive applications, including robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous navigation (Mu et al., 2023; Collaboration et al., 2023). In SPATIALAB, we organize spatial reasoning into six principal categories, Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each linked to distinct cognitive faculty studied in psychology and spatial cognition (Baddeley, 1998; Previc, 1998). 1 Here, E.

Best Baseline Performance. 3 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 2: Representative examples from six categories in open-ended and MCQ Tasks. As shown in Figure 1 and Appendix B, each category is further decomposed into five subcategories, producing taxonomy of thirty task types that isolate fine-grained reasoning skills, such as directional alignment, occlusion inference, or stability prediction. This classification scheme is motivated by the need to capture the full spectrum of visualspatial reasoning challenges. By systematically breaking down complex reasoning into measurable and testable units, we can evaluate not only whether models solve spatial tasks but also which specific dimensions remain fragile or underdeveloped (Gardner, 2011; Huang et al., 2022; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Moreover, we adopt two complementary evaluation formats: multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. The multiple-choice format probes recognition and fine discrimination among distractors, while the open-ended format measures generative reasoning and compositional description (Driess et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2022). Together, these formats reflect real-world reasoning demands and expose different strengths and weaknesses in model capabilities. By combining principled taxonomy, diverse real-world imagery, and dual evaluation formats, SPATIALAB provides structured framework for systematic benchmarking. This setup enables fine-grained model comparison, alignment with human-level performance, and deeper insights into the development of robust spatial cognition in artificial agents."

            "title": "3 SPATIALAB BENCHMARK",
            "content": "Spatial reasoning remains persistent challenge for visionlanguage models (VLMs), especially in naturalistic conditions where occlusion, perspective distortion, and noisy backgrounds co-occur. To address this, we present SPATIALAB, benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs capacity for complex spatial cognition under realistic visual conditions. The benchmark comprises 1,400 visual questionanswer pairs organized into six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each further divided into five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Every subcategory includes at least 25 QA pairs, while each top-level category contributes minimum of 200, ensuring balanced coverage across the taxonomy. SPATIALAB supports both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation, enabling assessment of discriminative accuracy as well as generative reasoning and explanatory competence, thus aligning with broader multimodal evaluation practices while emphasizing spatial-specific reasoning. High visual diversity, fine-grained annotation, and rigorous quality control make SPATIALAB reliable and scalable testbed, and Figure 2 illustrates representative examples from the six categories, showcasing both open-ended and multiple-choice formats that capture the richness and difficulty of real-world spatial reasoning tasks. 3.1 BENCHMARK CONSTRUCTION Image Collection. The image corpus was curated using three complementary strategies: (i) automated large-scale web crawling, (ii) targeted online retrieval of scene-specific images, and (iii) manual snapshots collected in diverse indoor and outdoor environments (Figure 3). This multi-source pipeline ensures diversity across object categories, environmental conditions, and spatial configurations. To explicitly capture natural variability, images were profiled along six meta-dimensions: lighting condition (high contrast, low contrast, shadows, and reflective settings), texture complexity (uniform, patterned, and complex), edge complexity (sharp and smooth boundaries), dominant spatial relation 4 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 3: Data creation pipeline for SPATIALAB. Images are collected via web crawling, targeted search, and manual snapshots, followed by structured annotation of spatial questionanswer pairs. (stacked, scattered, aligned), material type (transparent, translucent, opaque, reflective), and gravity constraints (normal, floating, and unconstrained). Each dimension was systematically represented in the final corpus, ensuring that the benchmark reflects broad spectrum of real-world, in-the-wild scenarios rather than simplified or synthetic setups. Complexity analysis of the corpus reveals that on average images contain 21.48 objects, of which 11.88 are partially visible, distributed across 3.23 distinct depth layers. Spatial reference chains (e.g., object is left of B, which is behind C) contain 2.07 links, indicating the presence of multi-step relational reasoning. Also, 16.71% of the questions require mental rotation; 56.07% require object specificity (specific color, pattern, or other details). Such statistics posits that SPATIALAB captures cluttered, layered, and relationally rich scenes, which are characteristic of real-world spatial reasoning, underrepresented in synthetic datasets. Annotation. Annotation proceeded in three phases. First, annotators underwent targeted training (derails are available in Appendix C.2) to ensure consistency in interpreting spatial categories and subcategories. Second, each image was paired with one or more spatial QA tasks covering range of reasoning types such as proximity gradients, alignment patterns, occlusion inference, and stability prediction. Questions were designed to balance perceptual grounding with higher-order inference (e.g., predicting stability under gravity constraints). Third, QA pairs were encoded in both multiplechoice (04 options) and open-ended formats, ensuring comparability across evaluation paradigms. In total, it produces around 1,500 spatial visual QA pairs, across six categories and 30 subcategories. Review and Quality Control. To ensure reliability, annotation outputs underwent three-tier review and validation pipeline. In the first stage, QA items were checked for semantic validity and alignment with the designated subcategory. In the second stage, independent annotators verified correctness of both the question phrasing and the designated answer, focusing on eliminating ambiguity and enforcing task clarity. In the third stage, gold-standard annotation round was conducted, establishing set of high-confidence QA pairs for evaluation. All metadata was removed from the images, and the dataset was carefully curated to avoid copyright concerns, though minor oversights may still occur. This procedure yielded final benchmark of 1,400 validated QA items."

We measure accuracy as the primary metric for both MCQ and open-ended tasks. For MCQ evaluation, we use direct prompting, where models return the option number corresponding to their selected answer. Responses are automatically checked against the correct answer. Detailed prompts and details are provided in Appendix D.1. For open-ended evaluation, models are prompted to generate free-form answers, which are then assessed using large language model judge. Prompts and details are available Appendix D.2. To evaluate the performance of LLM Judge with humans, we performed LLM-human agreement analysis too, as detailed in Appendix D.2. Table 5 demonstrates that the LLM judge (Gemini-2.5-Flash) achieves substantial agreement with human annotators, with Cohens kappa of 0.738 against the majority vote and 0.6810.795 against individual annotators. Raw accuracy against the majority vote is 0.880, while Fleiss kappa among human annotators is 0.774, indicating strong reliability.

To enhance spatial reasoning on our diverse benchmark, we explore reasoning strategies including inherent reasoning in the VLMs (Appendix H.1), Chain-ofThoughts (CoT) (Appendix H.2), CoT with self-reflection (Appendix H.3), supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Appendix H.4), and multi-agent systems (Appendix H.5). For SFT, specifically, Qwen-VL2.53B-Instruct was fine-tuned on 40% of the dataset with stratified sampling, improving generalization across relational and geometric tasks. Evaluation on the remaining 60% showed reduced errors in navigation and orientation, with additive gains when integrating CoT and SFT. However, agentic reasoning revealed that while orientation benefits substantially, other categories stagnate or degrade, underscoring that deeper perceptual and spatial grounding is required beyond multi-step reasoning."

Reasoningand instruction-tuned models (e.g., o4-mini: 53.21%, Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking: 52.93%, GPT-5-mini: 54.29%) and some very large opensource models (e.g., InternVL3.5-72B: 54.93%, Llama-3.2-90B: 50.36%) rank near the top, but model scale alone is not determinative: for example, Llama-3.2-11B attains only 30.50% despite its substantial size. Category-wise, Orientation and 3D Geometry are where many strong models excel (several models exceed 60% on orientation or 3D geometry), whereas Spatial Navigation, Depth & Occlusion, and Size & Scale are more variable and generally harder across the board. Notably, the spatially specialized models (SpaceOm, SpaceThinker, SpaceQwen) achieve only mid-40s to low-40s overall, so specialization does not automatically translate to higher MCQ accuracy across our diverse question set. Depth & Occlusion and Size & Scale show mixed results, some architectures handle occlusion relatively well while others fail, pointing to differing inductive biases or training data. These patterns imply that instruction-tuning and reasoning capability particularly help geometric and orientation reasoning, while multi-step grounding tasks like navigation remain an open weakness. SPATIALAB-OPEN. Open-ended evaluation scores presented in Table 3 are substantially lower than MCQ results and show wide spread: overall accuracy ranges from about 9.6% (InternVL3.51B) up to 40.9% (GPT-5-mini), while the human baseline sits at 64.9%, indicating large gap to close. Proprietary models generally lead the leaderboard on open-ended tasks (e.g., GPT-5-mini 40.93%, GPT-4o-mini 26.00%, Gemini-2.5-Flash 30.93%), but reasoning-tuned variants stand out in particular, the o4-mini (37.86%) and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking (32.77%) perform noticeably better than many baseline open-source counterparts, suggesting instruction/CoT-style tuning substantially improves generative outputs. Most open-source small models cluster at the bottom (many in the teens; InternVL3.5-1B = 9.64%, Qwen-VL2.5-3B = 12.93%), whereas some very large open models improve to the low-20s (e.g., InternVL3.5-72B = 23.36%, Qwen-VL2.5-72B = 24.64%), showing that scale alone yields only modest gains. Spatial-specialist models (SpaceOm, SpaceThinker, SpaceQwen) attain only 1013% overall, implying that architecture or task specialization does not automatically translate to robust open-ended generation across our diverse question set. Across subtasks we observe relatively better performance on orientation and certain relative-position items for top models (e.g., GPT-5-mini Rel.Pos = 49.53%, Ori = 37.13%), while depth & occlusion, size 7 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 & scale, and especially spatial navigation remain consistently hard (many models score <30% on these subtasks). This pattern reinforces the earlier finding that multi-step grounding and perceptual reasoning are the bottlenecks for open generative answers. 5.2 PERFORMANCE DROP IN OPEN-ENDED EVALUATION COMPARED TO MCQ Across 25 models, the average MCQopen-ended performance gap in SPATIALAB is 23.0% (σ = 5.5%), with subtask means ranging from 22.89% (spatial navigation) to 24.57% (3D geometry). Specialist spatial reasoning models exhibit the largest gaps (about 27%), particularly in spatial navigation (up to 36.68%) and orientation (34.44%), while reasoning-oriented models achieve smaller gaps (around 19%) and lower subtask variance, reflecting the stabilizing effect of instruction-tuning and CoT decoding. Correlations confirm that spatial navigation dominates overall disparity (Pearson = 0.99), with orientation (r = 0.83) and 3D geometry (r = 0.79) also contributing. Negative or near-zero gaps (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B: -1.98 in depth & occlusion; o4-mini: -3.18 in relative position) indicate that poorly designed MCQ distractors can misrepresent true competence. We hypothesize that format sensitivity arises from MCQs structural advantage, specialization bias toward categorical tasks, sequential reasoning challenges in spatio-navigation, and calibration differences in generative output. These findings suggest that MCQ alone can overestimate practical spatial reasoning ability. We recommend complementing MCQ with open-ended evaluations, auditing distractors, employing stepwise generation or instruction-tuning, and reporting per-subtask diagnostics to capture true model performance and reduce format-dependent artifacts. More details are in Appendix and Table 18. 5.3 ERROR ANALYSIS SPATIALAB-MCQ. Our analysis (Appendix E) shows that VLMs achieve selective peaks but lack holistic spatial competence. Closed-source models reach the highest scores (e.g., 85.71% in Stacking Orientation), yet collapse to near-chance in Relative Size Comparison. Open-source scaling improves ceilings (80.56% in Corner/Angle Positioning) but does not prevent catastrophic failures (2.0% in Object Rotation). Reasoning-augmented and spatially specialized models add localized gains, such as in occlusion inference or navigation, but remain capped below 55% in many physical abstraction tasks (Gravity Effects, Stability Prediction). Error distributions further reveal systematic weaknesses in embodied reasoning (Tool Handedness), recursive relational chaining (Pathway Existence), and non-local cues (Reflective Surfaces), while stronger results in Obstacle Avoidance suggest shortcut exploitation rather than robust planning. Taken together, these patterns confirm that current VLMs rely heavily on surface-level correlations and lack stable encodings of orientation, physics, and compositional logic. Progress will likely require both richer training distributions (e.g., embodied and physics-driven data) and architectural mechanisms for geometric and reference-frame grounding. SPATIALAB-OPEN. Error analysis of SPATIALAB-OPEN (Appendix F) reveals that even topperforming closed-source models (e.g., GPT-5-mini: 58.14% in Directional Relations) collapse on tasks like Proximity Gradients, indicating that dominance remains task-specific. Large open-source models achieve strong results in Depth & Occlusion (e.g., 60.0%) but still fall to 9.3% on Proximity, showing that scale alone cannot ensure robustness. Smaller models exhibit isolated strengths (e.g., 26.0% in Relative Size Comparison) but often break down completely (e.g., 0.0% in Betweenness), reflecting the limitations of compact architectures. Reasoning-tuned systems show promise, Gemini2.5-Flash-Thinking reaches 75.0% in Tool Handedness, yet similar models fall to single digits, revealing fragile integration. Specialized spatial models perform worst overall, rarely exceeding 20% and frequently failing on core relational tasks. Failure patterns highlight systemic weaknesses in occlusion handling, orientation, and multi-step relational chaining, while partial success in sizescale cues suggests reliance on superficial correlations. These results point to three root causes: missing representations for spatial analogies, architectural limits tied to scale and training diversity, and brittle reasoning pipelines underscoring the requirement for unified geometric encodings, physics-aware reasoning, and embodied data to move from isolated peaks toward consistent spatial competence. Qualitative Error Analysis. To better understand model weaknesses, we conducted qualitative error analysis (see Appendix I) and found that failures cluster into small number of recurring classes rather than being random noise. Common errors include spatial mislocalization, where models confuse referents in crowded scenes; perspective and scale mistakes, where reliance on objectsize priors overrides image-based cues; and occlusion or ordering failures, especially with thin or Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Category MCQ Open-ended Before After Gain Before After Gain 3D Geometry Depth & Occlusion Orientation Relative Positioning Size & Scale Spatial Navigation Grand Total 30.07 23.87 23.33 26.19 27.63 22.38 25.63 37.76 32.90 36.67 27.78 44.74 38. 7.69 9.03 13.33 1.59 17.11 16.08 36.59 10.97 20.28 43.23 39.67 51.18 18.42 36.62 34.40 3.50 23.78 2.58 45.81 42.15 2.48 50.39 0.79 14.47 3.95 2.82 39. 35.48 1.07 (a) SFT performance trends over epochs. (b) Performance comparison (Before vs After) across categories for MCQ and Open-ended formats. Figure 4: SFT training results: (a) learning trends over epochs, and (b) final accuracy values. partially hidden structures. We also observe attribute confusion, such as mixing perceptual properties with functional ones, and open-ended rationalizations that generate fluent but visually ungrounded narratives. These errors are consistent across architectures and prompting styles, suggesting structural biases in current VLMs rather than dataset-specific noise. Importantly, failure rates spike when multiple cues must be fused, such as combining depth ordering with relative size, and confidence calibration is especially poor in open-ended settings. Our diagnostic protocols confirm that models often ignore minimal but decisive visual features, rely on brittle heuristics, and fail to update when counterfactual edits are applied. The root causes point to insufficient object-centric binding, lack of geometric supervision, and training objectives that reward plausibility over grounding. Together, these findings highlight that current VLMs achieve strong coarse perception but struggle with multicue integration and grounded reasoning, underscoring the need for geometry-aware supervision, multi-scale feature retention, and verification pipelines. 5.4 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT APPROACHES Inherent Reasoning Mechanisms. We notice that reasoning-enabled models consistently outperform their baselines in both MCQ and open-ended formats, with the largest gains in relational and orientation tasks (e.g., +13.1% in Relative Positioning for MCQ). While reasoning helps stabilize open-ended performance, improvements remain uneven across categories (notably declining in Size & Scale), underscoring that reasoning modules boost logical consistency but do not fully solve grounding or scale sensitivity. Detailed per-category comparisons are provided in Appendix H.1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting. Across models, CoT prompting provides little benefit and often reduces accuracy  (Table 19)  , with orientation being the only category showing consistent gains. This indicates that while step-by-step reasoning helps with directional alignment, it fails in tasks requiring robust perceptual grounding such as depth, scale, and spatial navigation. Unlike in textual reasoning, CoT here tends to amplify flawed priors rather than correct them, underscoring that solving SPATIALAB requires perceptual understanding beyond logical chaining (details in Appendix H.2). Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with Self-Reflection. Adding self-reflection to CoT prompting, where models are explicitly prompted to review their previous reasoning step-by-step and correct mistakes (see Figure 8 in Appendix for prompt), yields modest benefits in multiple-choice settings, especially for geometry and depth. However, this fails to generalize to open-ended tasks (Appendix H.3). This confirms that reflective reasoning cannot compensate for missing perceptual grounding, highlighting core limitation of current VLMs. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). As shown in Figure 4, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), conducted on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct using stratified 40% split of SPATIALAB (560 samples), consistently improves MCQ accuracy across all spatial reasoning categories. However, it offers little, and sometimes negative, transfer to open-ended tasks. This divergence suggests overfitting to task-specific answer distributions, reinforcing concerns that SFT often teaches to the test rather than fostering generalizable reasoning (Wang et al., 2025). The sharp drop in open-ended performance points to biased internal representations, tuned for categorical discrimination but unstable in generative settings. likely cause is catastrophic forgetting of linguistic priors during fine-tuning (Huang et al., 2024a), compounded by objectives that favor discrete-choice alignment over spatial reasoning in language. Overall, while SFT enhances performance in structured formats, it risks creating an algorithmic straightjacket, boosting accuracy in constrained tasks while stalling progress in naturalistic spatial reasoning. More details are available in Appendix H.4. Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 AI Agents for Spatial Reasoning. To explore agentic capabilities, we employ SPATIOXOLVER, multi-agent system adapted and extended from Xolver (Hosain et al., 2025) designed to perform structured spatial reasoning on images. This framework decomposes complex visual reasoning into specialized sub-tasks managed by dedicated agents, including modules for object segmentation, attribute extraction, spatial relation mapping, and transformation tracking. By consolidating these outputs into unified structured representation, the system attempts to propagate low-level perceptual cues through higher-order relational inferences. We implemented the pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash with low temperature to ensure deterministic outputs during the multi-stage refinement process. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains in the Orientation category, improving by +8.00% in MCQ and an impressive +36.00% in open-ended evaluation. However, this success is not universal; categories such as Depth & Occlusion and Spatial Navigation suffered severe declines of -24.00% and -12.00% in open evaluation, respectively. These drops indicate that when inherent perceptual priorssuch as depth or occlusion cuesare weak, multi-step reasoning tends to reinforce misconceptions rather than correct them. Ultimately, these findings suggest that while agentic workflows enhance tasks reducible to sequential alignment, they cannot compensate for lack of fundamental perceptual grounding in complex 3D environments. More details are available in Appendix H.5."

            "content": "Spatial reasoning is central to embodied intelligence, yet most benchmarks rely on synthetic scenes, templated questions, or narrow task scopes that overlook real-world visual variability. We introduce SPATIALAB, benchmark of 1,400 visual questionanswer pairs covering six major spatial categories and 30 subcategories, including 3D geometry, occlusion, and navigation. The benchmark uses both Multiple-Choice and Open-Ended formats to separate option-based pattern use from genuine generative reasoning. Its quality is supported by multi-stage review process and complexity checks covering lighting, texture, and spatial diversity. Evaluations of more than 25 contemporary models and human baselines show that SPATIALAB functions as precise diagnostic tool for identifying weaknesses in current visionlanguage systems. Our experimental findings reveal persistent competence gap: while human baselines exceed 87% accuracy, even the best-performing models stagnate near 55% in MCQ tasks and suffer further 10-25% performance collapse in open-ended generation. Detailed error analysis uncovers systematic failures in handling transparency, multi-step navigation, and occlusion, indicating that models often rely on surface-level texture cues rather than internalized 3D geometric representations. While interventions such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) yielded clear gains in structured MCQ tasks, they simultaneously triggered instability in open-ended reasoning, suggesting catastrophic forgetting of linguistic priors when optimizing for discrete answers. Furthermore, reasoning-based approaches like Chain-of-Thought proved effective for sequential tasks like Orientation but failed to correct fundamental perceptual errors in Depth and Scale, often amplifying hallucinations instead of resolving them. Agentic decompositions showed similar trade-offs, improving specific alignment tasks while degrading performance in holistic scene understanding contexts. These divergent behaviors confirm that scaling laws and reasoning scaffolds alone are insufficient; achieving human-level spatial intelligence will require architectural innovations that explicitly integrate geometric grounding and physics-aware representations."

            "content": "Spatial reasoning in multimodal models. Spatial reasoning, the capacity to understand geometric structures and relational layouts in visual scenes, is central to embodied intelligence. Early multimodal benchmarks such as CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2016) and GQA (Hudson & Manning, 2019) tested compositional reasoning with synthetic or curated templates, which allowed controlled analysis but provided limited ecological validity. With the advent of large visionlanguage models (VLMs) (Li et al., 2023; Alayrac et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023), spatial reasoning has been revisited in more naturalistic datasets, though systematic weaknesses remain. Despite strong performance on captioning and visual QA, these models often fail in tasks requiring depth ordering, occlusion inference, or consistent reference-frame alignment. This discrepancy highlights broader problem: scaling alone does not guarantee progress in structured spatial understanding. Spatial reasoning benchmarks. range of benchmarks have recently been proposed to probe these gaps  (Table 1)  . SCANQA (Azuma et al., 2022) was among the first embodied QA datasets, requiring reasoning about 3D indoor environments, but its limited scale (800 scenes) and relatively shallow complexity restrict broader generalization. Datasets such as VISUAL SPATIAL (Liu et al., 2023) and WHATS UP (Kamath et al., 2023) expanded scope to real-world or household contexts, but relied on template-driven questions, leading to reduced linguistic variability and an overrepresentation of simple binary or multiple-choice relationships. More recent efforts, including EMBSPATIAL-BENCH (Du et al., 2024) and SPACE3D-BENCH (Szymanska et al., 2024), increased task variety yet remained constrained by scale (2.2K and 211 samples, respectively) and annotation style (template-heavy or manual but narrow). SPATIALRGPT-BENCH and BLINK-SPATIAL introduced mixed domains and up to 14 categories, improving diversity, but still emphasized either static snapshots or limited multi-view simulation. Embodiment, difficulty, and diversity. The trend toward embodiment is visible in datasets like ROBOSPATIAL (Song et al., 2024), which scales up to 1M scenes with robot-centric questions. However, its template-based annotation makes questions less natural and easier to game with heuristic shortcuts. Similarly, SPATIALVLM (Chen et al., 2024b) offers unprecedented scale (billions of QA pairs), but its two-category coverage renders it unsuitable for fine-grained diagnostic evaluation. On the other end, high-quality manual datasets such as VSI-BENCH (Yang et al., 2024) achieve improved annotation fidelity, but with only 288 scenes, they remain insufficient for training or robust cross-model comparison. In terms of complexity, most existing benchmarks cap at medium (Mm in Table 1), rarely extending to the hard or extremely hard levels that require multi-step causal inference. This leaves wide evaluation gap for next-generation models. Evaluation protocols. Equally important are evaluation types and analysis depth. Most prior work employs close-ended QA or binary judgments (e.g., VISUAL SPATIAL, EMBSPATIAL-BENCH), which simplify scoring but restrict the expressivity of model outputs. few datasets such as ROBOSPATIAL, SPATIAL-MM, and SPATIALAB-OPEN introduce open-ended evaluation, but only SPATIALAB-OPEN couples this with extremely high complexity, manual puzzle-style annotations, and comprehensive analysis of errors. This enables deeper understanding of systematic weaknesses beyond accuracy, including calibration and cross-model divergence, which existing datasets rarely capture. Without this granularity, performance gains can be misleading, as models may overfit to dataset-specific biases rather than generalizing robust spatial competence. Positioning of SPATIALAB. SPATIALAB directly addresses these limitations. Compared to prior datasets that span between 2 and 14 task categories, SPATIALAB covers 30 distinct categories across geometry, occlusion, orientation, relative positioning, size and scale, and navigation, offering unprecedented task diversity. Unlike template-based benchmarks, all questions are manually authored and puzzle-inspired, ensuring linguistic richness and reducing shortcut opportunities. Furthermore, SPATIALAB is fully embodied and multi-modal, including both static and dynamic visual contexts, thus bridging gaps between robotics-style datasets (ROBOSPATIAL) and web-scale corpora (SPATIALVLM). As shown in Table 1, even the strongest baselines, such as InternVL3.5-72B and GPT-5-mini, perform well below 60%, with the open-ended variant yielding only 40.93% accuracy. This large performance gap demonstrates the difficulty of the benchmark and its utility for driving future research. Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Toward next-generation evaluation. By combining high difficulty, broad coverage, manual annotation, and open-ended tasks, SPATIALAB extends the landscape of spatial reasoning benchmarks from template-driven, narrow evaluations to comprehensive, embodied testing. This design makes it possible not only to assess whether model answers correctly, but also to identify systematic error patterns, probe causal and counterfactual reasoning, and measure calibration reliability. In this sense, SPATIALAB provides rigorous foundation for the next phase of multimodal research, complementing datasets like MIND THE GAP and VLM4D that explore temporal or generative aspects but remain narrower in coverage. We expect future work to leverage SPATIALAB as high-bar diagnostic tool, pushing models beyond surface-level recognition toward genuine grounded spatial intelligence. A.1 DETAILED ANALYSIS OF LIMITATIONS IN PRIOR BENCHMARKS To situate SPATIALAB within the broader landscape, we conducted detailed examination of existing spatial reasoning benchmarks. Earlier efforts have contributed important foundations, yet they present structural and methodological constraints that limit their value for evaluating current VLMs. These constraints fall into three areas: synthetic-domain bias, limited task scope, and restrictive evaluation formats. Table 4 summarizes the major limitations identified. Synthetic and Template-Based Constraints. Benchmarks such as CLEVR and GQA rely on synthetic environments or template-generated linguistic structures. Although these settings offer controlled conditions for isolating compositional reasoning, the visual domain lacks real-world complexity and the linguistic space is narrow. Models can rely on template regularities rather than grounded spatial interpretation. Related simulated benchmarks such as ROBOSPATIAL face similar issues, resulting in large sim-to-real gap. Domain and Scale Limitations. Datasets grounded in 3D reconstruction, including ScanQA and Space3D-Bench, provide depth supervision but remain restricted to indoor scenes. This prevents assessment in outdoor or mixed environments that are essential for embodied agents. High-quality manual datasets such as VSI-Bench offer richer annotation but remain small in scale, limiting their usefulness for high-resolution subcategory analysis. Taxonomic and Evaluation Narrowness. Large-scale datasets such as SpatialVLM cover broad tasks but lack detailed taxonomies, making them unsuitable for diagnosing specific weaknesses in orientation, occlusion, or layout reasoning. Many recent benchmarks, including EMBSPATIAL-BENCH and WHATS UP, rely heavily on Binary or MCQ formats. These formats can inflate performance by enabling option elimination rather than requiring generative spatial reasoning. SPATIALAB mitigates these issues by combining MCQ and Open-Ended formats across detailed taxonomy of 30 spatial subcategories. Table 4: Limitations identified in representative prior spatial benchmarks compared with SPATIALAB. Limitations are categorized by domain constraints, evaluation format, and task taxonomy.

            "title": "B TASK DESIGN AND DESCRIPTIONS",
            "content": "Understanding spatial reasoning requires more than simple recognition of objects; it depends on how those objects relate, align, and interact in physical space. To capture this complexity, we introduce SpatiaLab, benchmark designed to test fine-grained aspects of spatial understanding across diverse categories. The tasks in SpatiaLab reflect how humans naturally describe and reason about environments, ranging from relative positioning (e.g., Whats to the left of the microwave?) to geometric inference (e.g., Would this stack fall if another book is added?). Each category is further broken into subcategories that highlight subtle but essential dimensions of reasoning, such 22 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 as occlusion, orientation, navigation, and physical effects like gravity. By framing each subtask in accessible, everyday terms, SpatiaLab encourages models to go beyond object detection and engage in structured spatial interpretation. This design allows us to probe how well systems generalize across contexts that matter for robotics, AR/VR, autonomous driving, and human-computer interaction. The following sections provide short, task-level descriptions for every category and subcategory in SpatiaLab. Figure 5: Categories and subcategories of spatial reasoning in SPATIALAB. Each category decomposes into five subcategories, yielding thirty task types in total. The following outlines the rationale and real-world utility guiding each task design, per category: B.1 RELATIVE POSITIONING Directional Relations. Directional relations describe how objects are positioned relative to one another, such as left, right, above, or below. Understanding these relations enables models to interpret spatial layouts more naturally, just like how humans describe scenes. For example, identifying what lies immediately to the left of an appliance helps in scene understanding and robot navigation. Proximity Gradients. Proximity reasoning involves recognizing which objects are closest or farthest from reference point. This is key for questions like Which object is nearest to the doorway? Models capable of estimating gradients of closeness can support navigation tasks and assistive technologies. 23 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Alignment Patterns. Alignment concerns whether objects follow certain orientation or order, such as being stacked vertically or arranged in straight line. Recognizing alignment patterns helps in understanding organization in environments like shelves, tables, or warehouses. Such reasoning is also critical for tasks like robotic sorting and automated inspection. Betweenness Relationships. Betweenness focuses on identifying objects that occupy the middle ground between two references. For instance, asking what sits between the lamp and the armchair requires reasoning about spatial continuity. This helps in navigation, retrieval, and situational awareness tasks. Corner/Angle Positioning. Corners and angled positions often serve as reference anchors in spatial reasoning. Questions such as Whats positioned in the back-right corner? require the model to localize objects within constrained regions. This kind of reasoning is vital in robotics for mapping and placement. B.2 DEPTH & OCCLUSION Layering Order. Layering requires distinguishing which objects appear in front versus behind. For example, identifying the frontmost item on table reflects depth reasoning. This is particularly useful in AR/VR applications where visual stacking affects user experience. Partial Occlusion. Partial occlusion occurs when one object hides part of another from view. Recognizing the hidden item behind coffee cup, for instance, requires filling in missing information. This strengthens robustness in perception systems operating in cluttered environments. Complete Occlusion Inference. Sometimes objects are fully hidden, yet clues like shadows or bulges reveal their presence. Inferring what lies under blanket requires the model to use indirect evidence. Such reasoning mirrors human inference in uncertain visual conditions. Transparency Effects. Transparent surfaces, such as glass or water, allow partial visibility of objects behind them. Understanding whats visible through fish tank requires blending occlusion reasoning with transparency perception. This plays an important role in simulation, graphics, and embodied AI. Reflective Surfaces. Reflective reasoning asks models to interpret mirrors, shiny metals, or glass reflections. Identifying what is reflected in mirror involves indirect spatial mapping. This is essential for safety in autonomous vehicles and situational awareness in robotics. B.3 ORIENTATION Cardinal Direction. Cardinal reasoning relates to compass directions like north, south, east, and west. Asking which way front door faces requires integrating global orientation cues. This is critical for navigation and geospatial alignment. Object Rotation. Rotation reasoning measures how much an object has been turned around an axis. Estimating that chair is rotated by some degrees is crucial for accurate 3D modeling. This helps robots align objects correctly for manipulation. Facing Direction. Facing direction specifies the orientation of an objects front side. For example, determining whether monitor faces north requires mapping its surface orientation to global references. This is important in surveillance and robotics. Stacking Orientation. Stacking involves understanding whether objects are piled vertically, horizontally, or in mixed orientations. Recognizing such layouts ensures stability in warehouses and homes. It is also critical for safe robotic stacking. Tool Handedness. Certain tools, like scissors or gloves, are designed for leftor right-handed use. Identifying handedness requires fine-grained shape and orientation perception. This enhances assistive robotics in human-centered environments. 24 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 B.4 SIZE & SCALE Relative Size Comparison. Relative comparisons assess whether one object is larger, taller, or smaller than another. Asking if vase is taller than statue requires proportional reasoning. This is crucial for packing, fitting, and recognition tasks. Perspective Distortion. Perspective can make distant objects appear smaller than nearby ones, even if the actual size differs. Identifying illusions like faraway car looking smaller than nearby bicycle requires compensating for depth cues. This ability makes models more robust to camera perspectives. Distance-Size Correlation. Here, size judgments depend on distance estimation. For instance, nearby bicycle appearing larger than far car should not confuse true size reasoning. This helps in navigation, AR/VR, and visual grounding. Scale Consistency. Scale reasoning involves checking whether object sizes are reasonable in context. mouse larger than chair signals inconsistency, which models must detect. This strengthens realism in simulated environments. Shadow-Size Projection. Shadows provide indirect cues about object size and light source position. Estimating how tall light must be based on shadow length requires geometric reasoning. This is useful in graphics, architecture, and physics-based modeling. B.5 SPATIAL NAVIGATION Pathway Existence. Pathway reasoning checks if clear route exists between two points. For example, determining if one can reach the desk without moving chairs tests navigability. This ability underpins indoor robot planning. Obstacle Avoidance. Avoidance requires finding routes that minimize collisions. Asking for the clearest path from door to window directly maps to robotic and human navigation. It is essential in autonomous driving and indoor mobility aids. Viewpoint Visibility. From given viewpoint, certain objects may be blocked or visible. For example, checking what is obscured when sitting on the couch requires simulating perspective. This strengthens AR/VR realism and robotic vision. Spatial Sequence. Sequence reasoning identifies the order of encounters along path. Walking from the kitchen to the balcony, one might pass the dining table first. Such reasoning mimics human navigation memory. Accessibility Constraints. Constraints identify which objects are blocked from access due to obstacles. For instance, cabinet may be unreachable because of table in front. This is crucial for assistive AI and ergonomic design. B.6 3D GEOMETRY Volume Comparison. Comparing volume asks which object occupies more three-dimensional space. Judging whether box is larger than sphere helps in packing and containment tasks. This is important for logistics and simulation. Stability Prediction. Stability reasoning predicts whether adding or moving objects will topple stack. For instance, checking if placing book will collapse pile mirrors human intuition. This supports safety in robotics and construction. Shape Projection. Projection tasks ask what shape an object would cast under certain rotations or lighting. For example, sphere always projects circle, while cube may project square or hexagon. Such reasoning strengthens geometric understanding. Spatial Containment. Containment checks whether one object can fit inside another. For example, reasoning if ball can fit in box supports packing and design. This task aligns with intuitive geometry. 25 Published as conference paper at ICLR Gravity Effects. Gravity reasoning predicts motion outcomes under physical forces. For example, rolling ball may stop under table due to friction and barriers. This strengthens real-world simulation capabilities."

            "content": "C.1 ANNOTATOR RECRUITMENT We recruited annotators aged between 24 and 30 years, all of whom were engineering graduates. They participated voluntarily and worked independently without external incentives. Before starting the annotation process, we provided structured training sessions to ensure clarity of task requirements and consistency across annotators. We also maintained all ethical and quality control standards throughout the process. This approach ensured that the resulting annotations were both reliable and aligned with the dataset design. C.2 ANNOTATOR TRAINING AND PROTOCOL Before beginning annotation, we designed structured training program to ensure consistency and reliability across the full taxonomy of tasks. We first introduced annotators to the six core categories (Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry) and their thirty subcategories. For each subcategory, we provided curated examples that illustrated the corresponding spatial relations (e.g., directional relations, occlusion inference, stability prediction) along with counter-examples to highlight common pitfalls. Beyond the taxonomy, we trained annotators to account for six meta-dimensions of image variability: lighting, texture complexity, edge density, dominant relation, material type, and gravity constraints, so that questions explicitly leveraged visual diversity. We demonstrated how these factors interact in real-world settings, such as reasoning about occlusion under low-contrast lighting or maintaining scale consistency under perspective distortion. We also introduced the two evaluation modes: multiple-choice and open-ended. In multiple-choice settings, annotators learned to design precise distractors to test fine-grained discrimination, while in open-ended settings they practiced formulating prompts that encourage compositional reasoning. To ground this training, we ran calibration sessions in which annotators generated both types of questions for sample images and iteratively refined their designs with feedback. To situate task design within the broader research landscape, we reviewed prior benchmarks (e.g., SpatialBotBench, EmbSpatial, SpatialMM) with annotators and analyzed their limitations. These resources often emphasize simplified relations, synthetic or staged scenes, and narrow reasoning types, while neglecting natural complexity such as shadows, reflections, or gravity-sensitive stability. This gap analysis underscored the need for richer, more ambiguous, and dynamically layered spatial contexts. Finally, we provided detailed demonstrations of the annotation protocol. These demonstrations specified how to select images with sufficient spatial complexity, how to map questions unambiguously to subcategories, and how to avoid trivial formulations. We instructed annotators to prioritize tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as depth layering, relational chains, or cross-view scale inference, over binary labels. Through this systematic training and iterative feedback, we ensured that the final dataset balanced taxonomic coverage with real-world relevance."

We set temperature to 0 and max tokens to 10, while keeping all other generation parameters at their default values. 26 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 6: Prompts used for evaluation. D.2 OPEN-ENDED EVALUATION The prompts used for both the answer model and the judge model are provided in Figure 6. We set temperature to 0.7 and max tokens to 1200, with all other parameters kept at their default values. D.2.1 EVALUATION OF LLM-AS-A-JUDGE FOR OPEN-ENDED EVALUATION To evaluate Gemini-2.5-Flash as an automatic judge, we selected balanced set of 240 samples covering all categories. Each sample included the evaluation setup (question, ground truth, and model output), which was scored independently by three human annotators. Annotators assigned binary scores: 1 for correct and 0 for incorrect. We compared the LLMs judgments against the human annotations using multiple complementary agreement metrics, computed both overall and per category. Specifically, we employed Cohens Kappa, Accuracy with Majority Vote, and Fleiss Kappa, defined as follows. Cohens Kappa. Cohens kappa (κ) measures pairwise agreement between two raters while correcting for chance agreement. For binary task, it is defined as κ = pope , where po is the observed 1pe agreement and pe is the expected agreement by chance: pe = (cid:80) and p(2) . Here, p(1) p(2) c{0,1} p(1) are the marginal probabilities that each rater assigns class c. Anκ = 1: perfect agreement; κ = 0: agreement equals chance; κ < 0: systematic disagreement) We computed Cohens kappa between the LLM and each annotator individually (κHuman1, κHuman2, κHuman3), as well as between the LLM and the majority vote of the annotators (κmajority). Accuracy with Majority Vote. We also measured raw agreement between the LLM and the annotator majority. Accuracy is defined as Accuracy = 1 is the LLMs decision for sample i, and ymaj is the majority vote among annotators. Unlike Cohens kappa, accuracy does not correct for chance agreement; it simply reflects the proportion of identical labels.

Let nij denote the number of annotators assign1 nij(nij 1), where is the number ing category to item i, and define Pi = n(n1) of annotators. The observed agreement is = 1 i=1 Pi, and the expected agreement is Pe = (cid:80) . Higher values indicate stronger inter-annotator reliability beyond chance. nij.

Certain categories, such as 3D Geometry, reach perfect agreement with κ = 1.000 and accuracy of 1.000. Depth & Occlusion also shows high agreement (κ majority = 0.805, accuracy = 0.909). Categories like Orientation (κ = 0.500, accuracy = 0.810) and Size & Scale (κ = 0.417, accuracy = 0.714) show moderate agreement but remain within acceptable reliability ranges. These results indicate that Gemini-2.5-Flash performs comparably to human evaluators in scoring correctness, with Cohens kappa values mostly in the substantial range (0.610.80) and some categories reaching almost perfect agreement (higher than 0.81). Fleiss kappa of 0.774 confirms that human annotators themselves are highly consistent, validating the reliability of the reference scores. The LLM achieves perfect or near-perfect agreement in clearly defined categories such as 3D Geometry (κ = 1.000, accuracy = 1.000) and Spatial Navigation (κ = 0.815, accuracy = 0.933), demonstrating accurate pattern recognition. Moderate agreement in categories like Orientation and Size & Scale reflects task complexity and inherent subjectivity rather than model shortcomings. Overall, it shows that LLM-as-judge shows robust reliability and can serve as practical automated scoring tool, closely mirroring human evaluation. ERROR ANALYSIS OF SPATIALAB-MCQ E.1 SUB-CATEGORY-WISE QUANTITATIVE ERROR ANALYSIS Closed-source Models. Closed-source models  (Table 6)  produce some of the strongest results across the benchmark. The best case is GPT-4o-mini, which reaches 85.71% in Stacking Orientation, the highest score overall. Gemini-2.0-Flash performs well in occlusion and projection, achieving 64.0% in Partial Occlusion and 64.71% in Shadow-Size Projection. Similarly, GPT-5-mini scores 68.0% in Tool Handedness and 55.71% in Layering Order. Weaknesses remain, as Claude 3.5 Haiku only reaches 32.0% in Relative Size Comparison. On average, closed-source systems outperform open-source ones by 1525 percentage points across several categories. However, within-model variation remains large, often exceeding 50 percentage points. We therefore conclude that while closed-source training pipelines deliver higher ceilings, they do not solve the challenge of uniform spatial competence. 28 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 6: Multiple-choice Evaluation Accuracy on SPATIALAB-MCQ by Question Sub-Categories for Closed-source Models.

When scaling to large open-source models  (Table 7)  , we see clear improvements but also severe fragilities. The InternVL3.5-72B achieves 80.56% in Corner/Angle Positioning, one of the highest open-source results. Both InternVL3.5-72B and llama-3.2-90bvision-instruct reach 66.67% in Complete Occlusion Inference. Yet weaknesses persist, such as the llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct scoring only 2.0% in Object Rotation. Gains are also evident in Stacking Orientation, where llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct scores 71.43%, but this comes with losses in other categories. The within-model spread often exceeds 70 percentage points, highlighting brittle specialization. Gravity reasoning remains modest at 56.0%. We find that scaling yields higher peaks but does not resolve structural weaknesses. Our conclusion is that size amplifies selective strengths while leaving foundational representation gaps intact. Open-source Small Models. We observe that open-source small models  (Table 8)  display sharp contrasts in performance across sub-categories. For example, qwen-2.5-vl-7b-instruct reaches 74.29% in Stacking Orientation, while InternVL3.5-1B collapses to 12.0% in Cardinal Direction. Scores in Pathway Existence remain modest, with the best models tied at 34.78%.

The within-model spread often exceeds 60 percentage points, showing brittle generalization. These patterns suggest that smaller models are highly cue-dependent, performing well where visual templates are strong but failing in tasks requiring deeper spatial abstractions. We interpret this inconsistency as evidence that representation learning is uneven across sub-categories. Overall, we find that small models provide localized competence but lack robustness across the full spectrum of spatial reasoning. Reasoning Models. Reasoning-enhanced models  (Table 9)  show notable benefits in select tasks but remain inconsistent overall. o4-mini reaches 65.12% in Alignment Patterns and 56.0% in Gravity Effects, outperforming most open baselines. Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking achieves 62.75% in Shadow-Size Projection and 52.17% in Volume Comparison, demonstrating stronger geometric reasoning. The strongest results come from Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking, which scores 71.79% in Complete Occlusion Inference and 70.21% in Betweenness Relationships. Yet the same family fails in others, such as 34.0% in Cardinal Direction and 34.0% in Shape Projection. This variance shows that reasoning mechanisms improve depth in certain sub-categories but do not broaden coverage. Withinmodel spreads frequently exceed 35 percentage points. We conclude that reasoning augmentation adds localized capacity but leaves structural gaps in spatial understanding. Overall, these models demonstrate promise but not generalizable competence. Spatial Reasoning Models. Spatially specialized models  (Table 10)  reveal targeted improvements but lack generality. SpaceQwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieves 48.0% in Distance-Size Correlation and 49.02% in Scale Consistency, clearly surpassing many open-source baselines in sizescale reasoning. The same model leads in navigation tasks, with 53.66% in Accessibility Constraints and 44.0% in Obstacle Avoidance. SpaceOm and SpaceThinker-Qwen2.5VL-3B reach 50.0% in Stability Prediction, matching expectations for domain-specific reasoning. However, performance drops sharply in other tasks, such as only 24.0% for Spatial Containment. Rarely do these models exceed 55.0%, even in their strongest areas. The spread across sub-categories frequently surpasses 30 percentage points. We find that specialization drives narrow peaks but does not produce holistic competence. Our interpretation is that domain targeting enhances select abilities but fails to integrate them into robust, general framework. Overall Discussion. Across all categories (Table 8, Table 7, Table 6, Table 10, Table 9), we observe consistent fragmentation. Small open-source models peak at 74.29% in Stacking Orientation but collapse to 12.0% in Cardinal Direction. Larger models raise ceilings, such as 80.56% in Corner/Angle Positioning, but still fail catastrophically with 2.0% in Object Rotation.

We attribute these failures to two root causes: the absence of stable encodings of orientation and physics, and an over-reliance on surface-level correlations. The wide variance, from 85.71% highs to 2.0% lows, suggests models are pattern-matching rather than reasoning robustly about space. Scaling, proprietary training, and reasoning augmentations each provide benefits but none produce general coverage. Instead, each approach yields isolated peaks that coexist with glaring blind spots. The collective picture is one of fragmented competence rather than integrated ability. We conclude that progress in spatial reasoning will require architectural changes aimed at embedding consistent geometric grounding and physics-aware mechanisms. In sum, our results show both remarkable selective gains and the persistence of fundamental gaps in holistic spatial intelligence. 32 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 E.2 MODEL FAILURE ANALYSIS The distribution across categories and sub-categories in Table 11 reveals several notable patterns in model performance. Categories such as 3D Geometry and Size & Scale show relatively balanced distributions, yet both retain significant proportion of failures where no model answered correctly, suggesting that even basic geometric invariances are not reliably internalized. In contrast, Depth & Occlusion exhibits heavier tail in the mid-range (24 correct), pointing to partial but inconsistent reasoning about layered scenes. Orientation emerges as weak category overall, with especially low totals in Stacking Orientation and Tool Handedness, which indicates that reasoning about subtle directional or embodied affordances is poorly captured. Relative Positioning presents mixed picture: while some tasks like Proximity Gradients show moderate success, others such as Corner/Angle Positioning have many near-zero correct counts, reflecting brittleness in compositional reasoning over reference frames. Interestingly, Spatial Navigation shows comparatively stronger performance, particularly in Obstacle Avoidance and Viewpoint Visibility, but still has significant errors in Pathway Existence where relational chaining is needed. When aggregated, no category achieves uniformly high accuracy, and the Grand Total shows an even spread across 05 bins, suggesting that success is highly task-dependent rather than reflecting general spatial competence. Overall, models display isolated strengths but lack systematic reliability across spatial dimensions. These results suggest that current visionlanguage models struggle with several root causes tied to representational and reasoning bottlenecks. High error rates in Stacking Orientation and Tool Handedness indicate limited grounding in physics-based and embodied reasoning, consistent with models trained primarily on static internet imagery rather than interactive or task-driven data. The difficulty in Corner/Angle Positioning and Pathway Existence reflects inadequate multi-step relational chaining, pointing to weaknesses in their ability to handle recursive spatial logic. The inconsistency in Transparency Effects and Reflective Surfaces underscores the challenge of handling visual phenomena that require non-local cues, such as secondary reflections or occluded geometry. By contrast, comparatively better performance in Obstacle Avoidance suggests that models may have learned shortcuts from dataset biases, such as frequent co-occurrence patterns of walkable paths, rather than genuine planning ability. Taken together, these failures highlight that model training regimes overemphasize correlation-driven visual-language alignments while underrepresenting embodied, counterfactual, and physics-based reasoning. Addressing these issues likely requires richer training distributions (e.g., embodied simulation data, physics-augmented learning) and architectural innovations that can explicitly model reference frames and relational constraints. Without such advances, models will continue to show brittle competence that breaks down under compositional or physically grounded tasks. ERROR ANALYSIS OF SPATIALAB-OPEN F.1 SUB-CATEGORY-WISE QUANTITATIVE ERROR ANALYSIS Closed-source Models  (Table 12)  . We observe that closed-source models achieve the strongest overall performance in the open-ended evaluation, yet their results remain uneven across sub-categories. GPT-5-mini is the clear leader, consistently securing the best scores in 3D Geometry and elative Positioning, with peaks of 58.14% in Directional Relations and 55.81% in Alignment Patterns. In contrast, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude 3.5 Haiku register very weak results in Proximity Gradients (16.28%) and Perspective Distortion (12.0%), respectively. This wide gap highlights the fragility of even the strongest models when tasked with reasoning over subtle, continuous visual cues. We believe these disparities stem from the differential sophistication of models spatial reasoning pipelines, where some architectures capture relational and geometric structure more effectively than others. Tasks such as Proximity Gradients are particularly challenging, as they require analogical, graded reasoning rather than discrete classification. The fact that GPT-5-mini succeeds where others fail suggests that scaling and proprietary training corpora confer distinct advantages. Nevertheless, even the leader shows vulnerabilities, pointing to systemic issue: closed-source dominance is relative, not absolute, and the models still fall short of robust, human-like spatial reasoning. Open-source Large Models  (Table 13)  . For large open-source models, we find more distributed performance landscape, with different systems excelling in isolated sub-categories. llama-3.2-90bvision-instruct achieves 60.0% in Depth and Occlusion, while GLM-4.5V-106B-MoE leads in Spatial 33 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 12: Open-ended Evaluation Accuracy on SPATIALAB-OPEN by Question Sub-Categories for Closed-source Models.

Despite these highlights, several models collapse on Proximity Gradients, with qwen-2.5-vl-32b-instruct and qwen-2.5-vl-72b-instruct both scoring only 9.3%. This indicates that architectural scaling helps but does not guarantee coverage across difficult continuous-reasoning tasks. We hypothesize that much of this variation arises from heterogeneous training data: models exposed to richer depth and geometry corpora perform better in occlusion and containment tasks, while others generalize poorly. The persistent weakness on Proximity Gradients suggests that these systems are not optimized for subtle spatial analogies and distance scaling. We also observe higher inter-model variance in this group than among closed-source models, underscoring the impact of open-source development heterogeneity. Overall, large open-source models show encouraging peaks but inconsistent coverage, suggesting that scale alone is insufficient without targeted pre-training and fine-tuning.

Small open-source models predictably lag behind their larger counterparts, but their results reveal noteworthy localized strengths. qwen-2.5-vl-3b-instruct achieves 18.0% in Perspective Distortion and 26.0% in Relative Size Comparison, while Gemma-34B-it leads in Spatial Containment (24.0%) and Stability Prediction (21.43%). Yet these successes are offset by catastrophic failures: InternVL3.5-2B scores 0.0% in Betweenness Relationships, and InternVL3.5-1B manages only 2.0% in Shape Projection. We attribute this extreme variability to limited capacity and restricted training diversity, which prevent small models from learning robust representations of geometric and relational principles. Sub-categories that demand precise reasoning about orientation and hierarchy trigger complete breakdowns, as small misinterpretations translate into total failure. Nevertheless, their ability to occasionally outperform larger models in narrow tasks suggests that even small-scale training can instill isolated competencies. This points to the value of specialization but also confirms the structural ceiling of compact architectures. In short, small open-source models demonstrate pockets of promise but remain highly brittle, with overall accuracy limited by size and data constraints. Reasoning Models  (Table 15)  . Reasoning-oriented models present sharper internal divide, with Gemini-2.5-flash-thinking standing far above its peers. It records the best scores in nearly every sub-category, including Tool Handedness at 75.0% and Complete Occlusion Inference at 57.14%. By contrast, Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 struggles dramatically, scoring just 6.0% in Spatial Containment and lagging behind across the board. We believe this gap arises from differences in how these models integrate multi-modal streams into coherent reasoning frameworks. Gemini-2.5flash-thinking appears capable of forming and querying internal world models, enabling it to infer object interactions and physical properties more effectively. In contrast, weaker models rely heavily on surface-level pattern matching, which proves inadequate for compositional or causal reasoning. The consistently high performance of Gemini-2.5 across categories suggests that explicit reasoning mechanisms offer tangible benefits for spatial understanding. However, its failure to dominate Shape Projection and Betweenness Relationships shows that even advanced reasoning modules are not yet universally effective. Thus, while reasoning models hold promise, the category itself remains heterogeneous and far from solved. Spatial Reasoning Models  (Table 16)  . Spatial reasoning models, though explicitly designed for the task, record the lowest results overall. Performance is highly fragmented: several models tie at 16.0% in Gravity Effects, 8.0% in Shape Projection, and 14.29% in Stability Prediction. SpaceQwen2.5-VL3B-Instruct stands out slightly with 23.91% in Volume Comparison and 13.73% in Scale Consistency, but these scores remain far below competitive thresholds. At the other extreme, Betweenness Relationships and Corner/Angle Positioning collapse entirely, with models recording 0.0% and 35 Published as conference paper at ICLR Table 15: Open-ended Evaluation Accuracy on SPATIALAB-OPEN by Question Sub-Categories for Reasoning Models.

These results suggest that the models smaller capacity and narrowly focused training severely constrain their representational flexibility. We interpret the failures as evidence that narrow specialization without sufficient capacity or data breadth cannot yield generalizable spatial reasoning. Particularly on geometric and positional tasks, even slight representational errors lead to total breakdowns. Consequently, despite their focus, spatial reasoning models are least effective, underscoring the necessity of both scale and diversity in achieving robust performance. Overall Discussion. Across all categories, closed-source  (Table 12)  , open-source large  (Table 13)  , open-source small  (Table 14)  , reasoning  (Table 15)  , and spatial reasoning  (Table 16)  , we find consistent pattern of fragmented competence and systemic weaknesses. Closed-source models perform best overall, with GPT-5-mini achieving highs of 58.14% in Directional Relations and 55.81% in Alignment Patterns, yet even they collapse on Proximity Gradients. Large open-source models show impressive peaks, such as 60.0% in Depth and Occlusion, but still fail at just 9.3% in Proximity Gradients, illustrating that scale without specialization remains insufficient. Small open-source models confirm this further, with rare localized strengths (e.g., 26.0% in Relative Size Comparison) but catastrophic lows like 0.0% in Betweenness Relationships. Reasoning models demonstrate that explicit reasoning mechanisms can significantly improve results, with Gemini2.5-flash-thinking reaching 75.0% in Tool Handedness, yet peers like Kimi-VL-A3B fall to single digits, exposing the fragility of less-integrated reasoning frameworks. Spatial reasoning models, despite their specialization, underperform the most, with scores often below 15% and total failures on Betweenness Relationships. Taken together, these results highlight three root causes: (1) lack of robust representations for continuous and analogical spatial cues, (2) structural limitations tied to scale and training diversity, and (3) brittle reasoning pipelines that prevent models from generalizing across tasks. We conclude that no current approach, whether proprietary scaling, open-source expansion, reasoning integration, or specialization, delivers comprehensive coverage. The frequent performance gaps exceeding 50 percentage points within single model further confirm that progress is piecemeal. Future work must thus focus on unifying robust geometric encodings, physics-informed reasoning, and cross-task transfer, moving beyond isolated gains to achieve consistent spatial intelligence. 36 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 16: Open-ended Evaluation Accuracy on SPATIALAB-OPEN by Question Sub-Categories for Spatial Reasoning Models.

Depth and Occlusion is the hardest category overall, accumulating the highest zero-correct counts (72), particularly in Layering Order (20 zero) and Transparency Effects (16 zero), both requiring nuanced handling of occlusion and non-local cues. Orientation exhibits similar struggles: while Cardinal Direction achieves some mid-range success, Stacking Orientation (11 zero) and Tool Handedness (5 zero, none with perfect success) underscore the brittleness of embodied directional reasoning. Relative Positioning reveals widespread inconsistency, with tasks such as Betweenness Relationships and Proximity Gradients rarely solved by more than two or three models, while Corner/Angle Positioning shows low but somewhat balanced performance. Size and Scale appears relatively stronger, with multiple subcategories (e.g., Scale Consistency with 6 full successes) showing that some models internalize coarse perspective and scaling cues, though failures remain high in ShadowSize Projection (17 zero). Spatial Navigation is split: while Spatial Sequence and Obstacle Avoidance show occasional full-model success, Pathway Existence (16 zero) and Accessibility Constraints (10 zero) highlight persistent difficulty in multi-step relational chaining. Overall, the grand total reveals that across 356 items, zero-correct dominates (356), while only 74 items are solved by all five models, confirming that consistent spatial competence remains elusive. These findings indicate that the root causes of failure stem less from dataset design and more from the representational and reasoning limitations of current models. First, the dominance of errors in Depth and Occlusion reflects reliance on superficial appearance features rather than structured scene representations: for example, models may latch onto surface textures rather than reasoning about hidden layers, leading to systematic errors in Layering Order. Failures in Orientation tasks such as Tool Handedness expose the absence of embodied affordance modeling, since pretrained internet imagery often lacks explicit annotations of left/right handedness or stacking physics.

On the other hand, partial success in Size and Scale suggests that models exploit statistical regularities in perspective distortion or scale consistency, though they collapse under less frequent cases like shadows. These patterns collectively show that current models succeed when cues are salient and correlate with training priors but fail when reasoning requires counterfactual, compositional, or embodied inference. Addressing these issues will require architectural advances that explicitly model reference frames, occlusion layers, and physical dynamics, as well as training data enriched with embodied simulations and counterfactual augmentations. Without these, progress in spatial reasoning will remain fragmented, with models performing well on surface-level cues but breaking down on structured, real-world spatial logic. 38 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 18: Performance gap between MCQ and Open-ended (%) () across spatial categories on SPATIALAB. lower value indicates that model performs comparably in both setups, whereas higher value reflects greater disparity.

OPEN-ENDED PERFORMANCE GAPS In this section we provide detailed analysis of the performance gap between multiple-choice (MCQ) and open-ended evaluation formats across spatial reasoning categories in SPATIALAB, as demonstrated in Table 18. G.1 QUANTITATIVE SNAPSHOT Across 25 models, the average performance gap between MCQ and open-ended formats is 23.0% with standard deviation of 5.5%. Dataset-wide means per subtask are as follows: 3D geometry (24.57), depth & occlusion (23.45), orientation (23.70), relative positioning (23.11), size & scale (23.42), and spatial navigation (22.89), yielding an overall average of 23.01. The overall gap ranges from minimum of 11.93 to maximum of 31.57 (median 23.34). At the family level, spatial reasoning models exhibit the largest average gap (27.03), while reasoning-oriented models show the smallest (19.11). Proprietary models have lower gaps on average (21.09) compared to many long open-source models (24.51). Notably, the human baseline shows an overall gap of 22.64. The highest gaps are observed in InternVL3.5-72B (31.57%), Qwen-VL2.5-32B (29.85%), and SpaceQwen2.5VL-3B-Instruct (29.78%). The lowest belong to Llama-3.2-11B (11.93%), Gemini-2-Flash-Thinking (13.00%), and GPT-5-mini (13.36). Correlational analysis reveals that spatial navigation dominates the overall gap (Pearson = 0.99), with orientation (r = 0.83) and 3D geometry (r = 0.79) also showing strong alignment. G.2 PATTERNS AND OBSERVATIONS Three broad patterns emerge. First, specialist spatial reasoning models exhibit the largest MCQopen-ended gaps, suggesting they are optimized for classification-style supervision and less robust to free-form generation. By contrast, reasoning-focused models display smaller gaps, reflecting the stabilizing effect of chain-of-thoughtstyle training on generative outputs. Second, 39 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 spatial navigation is the strongest predictor of overall disparity: models that falter on open-ended navigation reasoning drive the aggregate gap. Orientation and 3D geometry subtasks also contribute significantly, while relative position and size/scale vary more idiosyncratically across models. Third, scale alone does not explain robustness: smaller models such as Llama-3.2-11B achieve among the lowest gaps, while very large models such as InternVL3.5-72B show the highest. Finally, several negative or near-zero gaps appear (e.g., depth & occlusion for Llama-3.2-11B at 1.98, relative position for o4-mini at 3.18), indicating that in some cases open-ended evaluation is more reliable than MCQ, likely due to misleading distractors. G.3 HYPOTHESES ON ROOT CAUSES We hypothesize several interacting factors that underlie the observed MCQopen-ended performance gaps in SPATIALAB, each supported by statistical observations: 1. MCQ structural advantage. MCQ format constrains the output space, allowing models to exploit surface cues or eliminate distractors. Across models, the mean MCQ score is systematically higher than the open-ended score, with the average gap at 23.0% and σ = 5.5%. Negative gaps observed for Llama-3.2-11B in depth & occlusion (1.98) and o4-mini in relative position (3.18) indicate that open-ended generation can occasionally outperform MCQ when distractors are misleading, reinforcing the notion that MCQ can artificially inflate or distort measured performance. Recommendation: To address this issue, we suggest complementing MCQ evaluations with open-ended tasks and subtask-level diagnostics, which can more accurately capture model competence and reduce overestimation caused by option-based cues. 2. Specialization bias in spatial reasoning models. Spatial reasoning models exhibit the largest average gaps (27.03%) despite being optimized for spatial tasks, suggesting that they may have been trained primarily on categorical or synthetic selection tasks rather than freeform generation. For instance, InternVL3.5-72B, 72B parameter spatial reasoning model, shows the highest overall gap (31.57%), particularly in spatial navigation (36.68%) and orientation (34.44%), highlighting reliance on classification-like supervision. Correlations between subtask gaps and overall gap (SpNav: = 0.99, Orientation: = 0.83) indicate that these format-dependent failures are concentrated in sequential and geometric reasoning tasks. Recommendation: To mitigate this bias, we recommend fine-tuning or instruction-tuning on open-ended spatial generation tasks, which can improve model robustness to generative formats and reduce reliance on categorical supervision. 3. Instruction-tuning and stepwise decoding. Reasoning-oriented models (e.g., Gemini-2Flash-Thinking, o4-mini) demonstrate smaller average gaps (around 19.11%) and lower variance across subtasks. For example, Gemini-2-Flash-Thinking has an overall gap of 13.0% and consistently modest subtask gaps (Difference in 3D Geometry: 13.9%, Difference Relative Positioning: 21.03%), suggesting that chain-of-thought or stepwise decoding helps models produce stable open-ended responses. This is further supported by reduced correlation between subtask gap variance and overall gap within this family, implying that instruction-tuned reasoning mitigates format sensitivity. Recommendation: To address format sensitivity, we suggest adopting chain-of-thought or stepwise decoding strategies and instruction-tuning for open-ended spatial tasks, which can improve generative consistency and reduce MCQ dependence. 4. Spatio-navigation stresses sequential grounding. Spatial navigation gaps are the strongest predictor of overall MCQopen-ended disparity (Pearson = 0.99). Models with high performance gaps in spatial navigation, such as SpaceQwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (Spatial Navigation gap = 35.87%), also exhibit large overall gaps (29.78%), indicating that multi-step referential reasoning is disproportionately affected in open-ended formats. This suggests that MCQ options simplify the reasoning chain, masking underlying weaknesses in sequential grounding and relational computation. Recommendation: To better capture sequential reasoning abilities, we recommend including dedicated open-ended spatio-navigation tasks and employing targeted multi-step reasoning supervision, which can improve grounding and reduce overestimation by MCQ. 40 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 5. MCQ distractor artifacts. Some negative or near-zero gaps indicate that poorly designed distractors can suppress measured MCQ performance. For example, o4-mini shows negative relative position gap (3.18%) while maintaining positive gaps in other subtasks, implying that distractor quality can artificially depress MCQ accuracy. Conversely, models like Qwen-VL2.5-32B-Instruct exhibit very high MCQopen gaps (overall = 29.85%) across multiple subtasks, suggesting that MCQ distractors can also exaggerate perceived competence in selection-based tasks. Recommendation: To address this, we suggest careful auditing and refinement of MCQ distractors and complementing them with open-ended evaluation, which can yield more accurate and unbiased measures of model spatial reasoning ability. G.4 PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Our findings show the importance of reporting both MCQ and open-ended results. Exclusive reliance on MCQ inflates estimates of practical spatial competence, with average disparities around 23%. Subtask-level breakdowns are essential, as spatial navigation disproportionately drives observed differences. Diagnostic evaluations that disentangle classification versus generative reasoning can better isolate error modes. Moreover, instruction-tuning and decoding strategies that encourage stepwise reasoning appear promising for reducing MCQ dependence. Finally, careful design and auditing of MCQ distractors are necessary to ensure fair comparisons across formats."

            "content": "To enhance spatial reasoning performance on our diverse visual question benchmark, we explored multiple complementary strategies. H.1 INHERENT REASONING MECHANISMS We next examine the role of built-in reasoning mechanisms by comparing standard models with their reasoning-enabled counterparts (Table 2, Table 3). Across MCQ evaluations, reasoning consistently boosts performance, though the magnitude varies by category. For instance, Gemini-2.5-FlashThinking improves over its non-reasoning variant by +4.64% overall (52.93% vs. 48.29%), with particularly strong gains in Relative Positioning (+13.1%) and Orientation (+8.6%). similar trend holds for o4-mini-medium, which reaches the highest overall MCQ accuracy (53.21%), suggesting that explicit reasoning scaffolds are especially effective in structured, discrete-answer settings. Open-ended evaluation reveals more nuanced picture. Here, reasoning-equipped models again outperform their baselines, but the gains are uneven. Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking improves slightly over Gemini-2.5-Flash (32.77% vs. 30.93%), but the largest leap is observed in o4-mini-medium (37.86%), which significantly surpasses all non-reasoning models. These results indicate that reasoning mechanisms help mitigate the instability seen in free-form generation, especially in complex categories such as 3D Geometry and Spatial Navigation. However, gains are not universal, reasoning models sometimes show regressions, e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking drops sharply in Size & Scale (21.74% vs. 26.59%), echoing our earlier finding that generative settings amplify brittleness. Overall, these comparisons highlight that explicit reasoning modules substantially enhance structured MCQ performance and can stabilize open-ended responses, but their benefits are uneven across categories. The results suggest that reasoning mechanisms strengthen logical consistency and relational chaining, yet they do not fully resolve the challenges of scale sensitivity, occlusion, and free-form linguistic grounding. H.2 CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (COT) PROMPTING To examine whether structured reasoning improves spatial performance, we further evaluated models under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. For each of the 30 sub-categories in SPATIALAB, we sampled 5 items (seed fixed to 42) to construct balanced test set covering all major spatial phenomena. This design ensures fair coverage while keeping evaluation computationally tractable. Example CoT prompts are shown in Figure 7, which illustrate the step-by-step reasoning scaffolds provided to 41 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 7: Chain-of-thought (CoT) Prompts. the models. The setup allows us to isolate the contribution of CoT reasoning from model scale or training. Table 19: Performance with CoT prompting across categories for InternvVL-3-78b and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

This suggests that reasoning helps when the task is reducible to logical alignment of directions, but fails when more complex perceptual priors (e.g., depth, scale, relative positioning) are required. We anticipate this happens because models lack inherent knowledge about 3D perception and geospatial relationships; they are not fundamentally aware of these concepts in the way humans are. As result, when CoT prompting is applied, the step-by-step reasoning does not correct misconceptions but instead reinforces them, propagating and amplifying errors across reasoning steps. This finding highlights that our benchmark is non-trivial: it cannot be solved merely by adding multi-step reasoning to existing models. Unlike textual reasoning tasks where CoT reliably improves outcomes, our benchmark exposes deeper architectural limitations in perceptual and spatial grounding. In categories like depth and size, incorrect priors mean that every additional reasoning step moves the model further from the correct solution. The sharp performance drops, particularly for Gemini in MCQ settings, demonstrate how fragile reasoning becomes when it is not supported by robust perceptual knowledge. Thus, our task design is strength, it goes beyond surface-level reasoning and probes whether models possess genuine understanding of geospatial and 3D relational concepts. Solving it requires more than chaining logic; it demands embeddings and training that capture core aspects of perception and spatial cognition. In this way, our benchmark challenges models at fundamental level and highlights an important gap in current architectures. 42 Published as conference paper at ICLR Figure 8: Chain-of-thought (CoT) with Self-Reflection Prompts. H.3 CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (COT) PROMPTING WITH SELF-REFLECTION We further extend the CoT setup by adding self-reflection stage, where the model is prompted to review and revise its initial reasoning before finalizing an answer (see Figure 8). The evaluation protocol remains identical to the standard CoT setting, using 5 balanced samples per sub-category (seed 42). This design isolates the effect of self-reflection while keeping the comparison directly aligned with baseline CoT performance.

For InternvVL-3-78b, overall accuracy declined slightly (2.66% MCQ, 8.67% 43 Published as conference paper at ICLR open-ended), with sharp drops in categories like depth, relative positioning, and navigation, suggesting that reflection often reinforced errors instead of correcting them. Some localized gains were observed, such as +12% in Size & Scale (MCQ), but these were inconsistent and offset by large degradations (28% in relative positioning open-ended). In contrast, Gemini-2.5-Flash showed strong MCQ gains (+20.66%), with particularly large improvements in 3D Geometry (+32%) and Depth & Occlusion (+24%), though open-ended improvements remained negligible (+0.67%). These results highlight key asymmetry: reflection helps in multiple-choice contexts where models can prune unlikely options, but does not transfer to free-form generation where uncertainty propagates into ungrounded rationales. We also find that the categories most improved by reflection are those where geometric consistency is central (orientation, depth, size), while tasks requiring relational integration across multiple objects (relative positioning, navigation) degrade. Overall, reflection functions as stabilizer in structured choice settings but fails to reliably enhance naturalistic reasoning. This observed inconsistency mirrors our earlier findings with plain CoT prompting: reasoning enhancements only succeed when the model has stable perceptual anchors to ground its steps. Selfreflection adds an explicit verification pass, but this mechanism is only as strong as the models internal priors. When depth cues, occlusion ordering, or coordinate frames are poorly encoded, the second pass amplifies misconceptions rather than repairing them. This explains why Gemini, which exhibits stronger perceptual grounding, benefits under MCQ conditions, while InternvVL-3-78b suffers more frequent degradations. The broader root cause lies in pretraining mismatch: current VLMs import reasoning templates from language modeling but lack the embedded 3D and geospatial representations that humans leverage. Without these anchors, reflection cannot perform true error correction; instead, it functions as linguistic filter that polishes reasoning syntax without improving perceptual grounding. As result, reflective reasoning loops provide modest utility in discrete answer formats but collapse under open-ended demands where factual verification is absent. These findings confirm that our benchmark shows fundamental gap in current architectures: surfacelevel reasoning layers alone cannot compensate for missing spatial cognition, and meaningful progress will require deeper integration of geometric and perceptual structure. Moreover, because VLLMs are commonly trained on web data, the concepts that are well-represented online are those where models tend to perform better, whereas poorly represented spatial and 3D concepts suffer, reinforcing these performance disparities. H.4 SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING (SFT) H.4.1 SETUP AND IMPLEMENTATION the 2.5 Qwen fine-tuned model We (unsloth/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) using parameter-efficient approach with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021). To accommodate limited GPU resources, we loaded the model in 4-bit precision (load in 4bit=True) and inserted LoRA adapters into attention and feed-forward network projection layers. The LoRA hyperparameters, including rank, scaling factor, dropout, and target modules, are summarized in Table 21. Gradient checkpointing was enabled to reduce memory usage, and fixed random seed ensured reproducibility. instruction-following VL 3B For tokenization, we followed the Qwen-2.5 chat template to maintain consistent formatting between training and inference. Each training example was converted into single text sequence, and dynamic padding was applied with DataCollatorForSeq2Seq. Training used an effective batch size of 4 (per-device batch size 1 with gradient accumulation of 4). Trainer and optimization hyperparameters, including learning rate, optimizer, weight decay, and scheduler, are listed in Table 22. The training loop consisted of four passes, each spanning single epoch, yielding four saved checkpoints. Overall, this setup allowed us to efficiently fine-tune large vision-language model on limited GPU resources while maintaining high adaptation capacity. H.4.2 SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING (SFT) PERFORMANCE The learning trends in Figure 4a reveal notable differences between the MCQ and Open-ended evaluation modes over training epochs. We observe that MCQ accuracy begins at lower baseline of 25.63% but rises consistently, converging near 36.59% by the fourth epoch. This steady improvement suggests that the model benefits strongly from additional supervised fine-tuning, particularly in tasks Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 21: LoRA Hyperparameters for SFT Hyperparameter Value Notes LoRA rank (r) Low-rank update capacity Scaling factor LoRA alpha LoRA dropout No dropout applied Gradient checkpointing Enabled Library-specific flag Adapter initialization 3407 LoRA random seed 16 16 0 Table 22: Trainer and Optimization Hyperparameters for SFT Hyperparameter Value Base model Max sequence length Load in 4-bit Per-device train batch size Gradient accumulation steps Effective batch size Learning rate Optimizer Weight decay LR scheduler Logging steps Seed Tokenizer template unsloth/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct 2048 True 1 4 4 2e-4 paged adamw 8bit 0.01 linear 1 42 Qwen-2. that constrain answers within limited candidate space. By contrast, Open-ended evaluation starts higher at 34.40% but declines sharply by the second epoch, dropping to as low as 12.62%. Only in later epochs does it partially recover, reaching 35.48% at the end. This instability points to sensitivity in open-ended generation that is not present in the MCQ setting, where the structure of multiple-choice questions provides more stable optimization signals. We interpret the fluctuations in open-ended performance as evidence that fine-tuning may overfit to MCQ-like reasoning patterns at the expense of free-form language generalization. The dotted baselines in the plot further highlight how the MCQ mode achieves gains beyond its initial standing, whereas Open-ended remains approximately stagnant. Overall, the figure illustrates that SFT predominantly favors MCQ tasks in terms of stability and consistent accuracy gains. The tabulated results in Table 4b complement the figure by providing detailed before-and-after breakdown across six spatial reasoning categories. Across MCQ tasks, we find that performance improved in every category, with gains ranging from modest 1.59% in Relative Positioning to substantial 17.11% in Size and Scale. The Grand Total gain for MCQ stands at 10.97%, confirming that the fine-tuning procedure effectively enhances structured-answer performance. In contrast, Open-ended results are far more mixed, with both positive and negative changes. Categories such as 3D Geometry and Spatial Navigation show small but positive gains (3.50% and 2.82%, respectively), yet Size and Scale exhibits significant drop of 3.95%. Relative Positioning also decreases by 0.79%, reflecting that fine-tuning can inadvertently harm certain reasoning modes in free-form contexts. The overall Open-ended gain is only 1.07%, which is statistically negligible compared to MCQ improvements. These results confirm that the effectiveness of SFT is highly sensitive to the evaluation paradigm. By isolating the categories, we underscore where training helps, where it fails, and how performance benefits differ between constrained and unconstrained outputs. deeper inspection reveals striking disparities between categories and formats. For MCQ, Size and Scale and Spatial Navigation yield the highest improvements, suggesting that models trained with multiple-choice prompts are especially effective at learning tasks requiring scale discrimination and navigational reasoning. However, in Open-ended form, Size and Scale actually declines, showing that the same learned representations do not transfer well to generative contexts. Similarly, Relative Positioning barely improves in MCQ and worsens in Open-ended, highlighting consistent weakness 45 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 in relational reasoning regardless of format. Conversely, Orientation shows strong MCQ gains (+13.33%) and small Open-ended improvements, suggesting that some categories generalize more robustly. We hypothesize that the divergence between the two formats may stem from the structural scaffolding MCQs provide, which reduces the need for the model to generate precise linguistic formulations. Open-ended tasks, by contrast, require simultaneous mastery of reasoning and natural language fluency, which amplifies weaknesses. The trends indicate that while fine-tuning strongly enhances pattern recognition in discrete-choice settings, it introduces volatility and even degradation when free expression is required. This duality makes clear that training interventions optimized for MCQs may not generalize seamlessly to unconstrained reasoning. The implications of these findings are twofold. First, we show that SFT as currently applied provides strong benefits for structured tasks but limited or even negative transfer to open-ended reasoning. This limitation is not only an artifact of fine-tuning, but also symptomatic of how contemporary VLMs are pretrained. Existing pretraining pipelines heavily emphasize broad imagetext alignment, object recognition, and captioning, yet they provide little explicit supervision on compositional spatial structures, occlusion layers, or geometric transformations. As result, models learn to excel at surface-level associations while failing to acquire robust representations of depth, orientation, or scale. The instability we observe in open-ended spatial reasoning suggests that the models learned priors are fragile: without multiple-choice scaffolding, they revert to shallow pattern-matching instead of grounded inference. Categories such as Size and Scale and Relative Positioning, where declines are most pronounced, point to missing inductive biases in pretraining, biases that humans develop through embodied interaction with 3D environments. Another contributing factor is the reliance on synthetic or instruction-following datasets that flatten spatial diversity into puzzle-like abstractions, preventing models from generalizing to real-world clutter, noise, and complexity. These findings underscore the need to rethink both pretraining and fine-tuning for spatial reasoning, incorporating datasets and objectives that reflect naturalistic visualspatial challenges. Ultimately, we argue that without targeted reforms, current VLMs risk reinforcing an algorithmic straightjacket: they appear competent under constrained evaluations yet remain brittle and unaligned with the embodied, flexible reasoning that humans bring to real-world spatial understanding. H.4.3 SFT DYNAMICS ANALYSIS To investigate the stability of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on spatial reasoning tasks, we conducted multi-seed validation study (N = 5, seeds AE) using the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model. The training trajectory, summarized in Table 23, reveals distinct divergence in performance dynamics between Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) and Open-Ended evaluation formats. Divergent Learning Trajectories. As illustrated in Table 23 and Figure 9, performance on SPATIALAB-MCQ exhibits monotonic improvement, rising from baseline of 25.63% to an average of 35.74% at Epoch 4. This indicates that the model successfully adapts to the discriminative nature of the task, learning to map visual features to constrained output options with increasing reliability. In sharp contrast, SPATIALAB-OPEN displays pronounced U-shaped trajectory across all seeds. Rather than steady improvement, the model suffers an immediate and significant performance collapse in the early epochs (dropping from 34.40% to an average of 19.26% at Epoch 1). While performance recovers in later epochs (converging to 34.82% at Epoch 4), the final gain over the zero-shot baseline is negligible (+0.42%). Representational Brittleness and Alignment Tax. We attribute this phenomenon to the fragility of spatial representations in current VLMs when subjected to fine-tuning. The initial collapse in open-ended accuracy suggests catastrophic forgetting of the linguistic priors required for fluent, grounded generation. As the model optimizes for the specific instruction-following format of the training data, it overfits to the structural logic of the tasks (benefiting MCQ) at the expense of the flexible, generative spatial grounding required for open-ended descriptions. The subsequent recovery phase represents the model re-learning to articulate spatial concepts within the new distribution, yet it fails to surpass the initial baseline significantly. This dynamic underscores critical finding: SFT is effective for teaching models to select correct spatial answers, but it does not 46 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 23: Multi-seed validation of SFT dynamics (N = 5). While MCQ performance improves steadily, Open-Ended performance exhibits systematic U-shaped collapse and recovery, indicating representational instability in generative spatial tasks.

H.4.4 PERFORMANCE GAIN ON EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS To assess whether the representations learned from SPATIALAB generalize beyond the benchmarks specific format, we evaluated the transferability of our fine-tuned model to three external spatial reasoning datasets: OMNISPATIAL, SPACE (Multimodal), and MIND THE GAP. We employed the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model, fine-tuned on SPATIALAB via the SFT protocol detailed in Appendix H.4.1, and evaluated it on these external benchmarks in zero-shot setting.

The consistent gains indicate that the model learns generalizable spatial representations rather than merely overfitting to the source datasets format."

The most significant Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 gain was observed on MIND THE GAP (+11.70%), suggesting that our benchmarks emphasis on occlusion and spatial continuity effectively addresses the reasoning gaps targeted by that dataset. Similarly, improvements on OMNISPATIAL (+7.05%) and SPACE (+5.24%) confirm that the geometric and relational concepts encoded in our taxonomy align with broader definitions of spatial intelligence in the literature. These results validate the quality of the SPATIALAB data. While the primary purpose of this work is to serve as rigorous diagnostic benchmark, the strong transferability demonstrates that the dataset does not merely encourage overfitting to specific question template. Instead, the diversity of the 30 sub-categories forces the model to acquire robust, transferable spatial representations that generalize to unseen distributions and task formats. H.5 AI AGENTS FOR SPATIAL REASONING We developed SPATIOXOLVER, multi-agent system adapted and extended from Xolver (Hosain et al., 2025), to perform structured spatial reasoning on images within the SPATIOLAB evaluation. The system decomposes complex visual reasoning into specialized sub-tasks, each managed by dedicated agent, allowing for focused processing of objects, attributes, relations, symmetries, and transformations. This modular design not only improves accuracy and interpretability but also supports multi-step reasoning, enabling the system to propagate low-level perceptual cues through higher-order relational and transformational inferences. The architecture, agent implementation, and their coordinated interaction are detailed in the following sections, with the full set of prompts provided in Figures 10, 11, and 12. H.5.1 AGENTS Base Visual Analysis Agent. Base Visual Language Model (VLM) agent initiates the pipeline by generating detailed textual description of the input image, capturing object typesincluding geometric shapes, natural elements, and artificial iconsalongside attributes such as size, orientation, color, and shading. Relative positions like leftmost, center, and top are encoded explicitly, and the prompt emphasizes exhaustive detail without summarization. Images are converted to data URIs and sent with the prompt to Gemini-2.5-based model, whose output is parsed into structured bullet-list using regex-based extraction. This structured description serves as the foundation for downstream agents, providing comprehensive perceptual anchor that encodes both explicit and implicit spatial cues. The approach ensures that even subtle visual features, such as partial occlusions or minor shape variations, are retained for later relational and transformational reasoning. Object Segmentation Agent. Object Segmentation agent converts the verbose textual description into discrete list of uniquely identified objects, differentiating between visually similar instances. Each object receives stable identifier (e.g., Obj1, Obj2) to maintain consistent references across subsequent reasoning steps. The agent uses carefully formatted prompts and calls the same Gemini2.5 model to structure the description, while post-processing splits lines by object ID to enforce consistency. This structured representation reduces ambiguity in downstream attribute and relation extraction, enabling precise mapping of complex scenes. By explicitly isolating objects, the agent also facilitates detection of overlaps, repetitions, and hierarchical groupings that may not be evident in raw descriptions. Attribute Extraction Agent. Attribute Extraction agent translates each object into structured JSON capturing core properties such as shape, size, color, shading, orientation, and positional descriptors. Prompts enforce strict JSON output, and responses are parsed using json.loads(), with fallback defaults to ensure robustness against model inconsistencies. This structured encoding allows quantitative and qualitative comparisons of objects, supporting later stages of spatial reasoning. By preserving both absolute and relative measures, the agent maintains fidelity to the original perceptual content, while also normalizing descriptors for computational consistency. The JSON structure enables programmatic downstream operations, such as calculating symmetries or detecting transformations. Spatial Relation Agent. The Spatial Relation agent encodes object interactions as triples (ObjectA,Relation,ObjectB), capturing directional relations (e.g., left of, above, inside) and higher-order alignments like rows, grids, or repetition patterns. Consistent object IDs are enforced to prevent 48 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 relational ambiguity, and parsing splits output lines starting with parentheses, followed by automated consistency checks. This step transforms static object descriptions into relational graph that encodes spatial topology and hierarchy. The resulting structure allows reasoning over both pairwise interactions and more complex scene configurations, which is critical for tasks like symmetry detection, grouping, and multi-step navigation of spatial layouts. Grouping and Symmetry Agent. Grouping and Symmetry agent abstracts higher-order patterns from object lists and spatial relations, identifying clusters, rows, grids, and symmetriesincluding vertical, horizontal, rotational, and translational. Outputs are requested in structured JSON with keys groups and symmetries, with empty structures as fallbacks to maintain downstream compatibility. This agent captures emergent scene regularities that are not apparent at the object or pairwise relation level, providing critical context for pattern recognition and reasoning. By formalizing structural redundancies and symmetries, the agent supports both perceptual inference and anticipatory reasoning for dynamic transformations. Transformation Tracking Agent. For multi-frame sequences, the Transformation Tracking agent logs object-level changes including translations, scaling, rotations, color/shading shifts, and appearance or disappearance events. Structured logs are extracted line-by-line using regex patterns that capture directional arrows, producing temporal representation of the scene. This encoding allows the system to track not just static spatial configurations but also dynamic evolution, supporting reasoning about motion, causality, and object interactions over time. The agent ensures that transformations are linked to consistent object IDs, enabling coherent cross-frame reasoning and predictive modeling. Representation Standardization Agent. Finally, the Representation Standardization agent consolidates all outputs into unified JSON format containing objects, relations, groups, symmetries, and transformations. Prompts enforce consistent object IDs and structured formatting, while JSON parsing failures revert to empty dictionaries to ensure pipeline robustness. By centralizing all perceptual, relational, and temporal information, this agent creates comprehensive scene representation that is both human-interpretable and machine-readable. The resulting unified structure serves as versatile foundation for downstream tasks, including reasoning evaluation, spatial pattern analysis, and multi-frame prediction. Open-Ended Spatial Reasoning Agent. The standardized representation feeds into the reasoning agent, which answers multiple-choice or pattern recognition questions. Inputs include objects, attributes, relations, groups, symmetries, and transformations. The model considers geometric patterns, relational alignment, and dynamic transformations to generate or select the correct answer. H.5.2 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS For our technical implementation, we use Gemini-2.5-Flash with low temperature (0.1) to ensure deterministic outputs and perform multiple iterations for refinement. API calls are handled via OpenRouter, supporting both text and image inputs, while parsing of model responses relies on regex and JSON-based extraction to generate structured outputs. All interactions are logged in JSON format for reproducibility, and the final output is unified JSON per image containing comprehensive information on objects, relations, symmetries, and transformations. This multi-agent decomposition allows each specialized model to focus on constrained sub-task, enhancing overall accuracy, interpretability, and robustness in structured spatial reasoning. H.5.3 EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS The evaluation protocol remains identical to the standard CoT and CoT-SR setting, using 5 balanced samples per sub-category (seed 42), making total of 150 samples. The evaluation of Gemini-2.5-Flash with agents highlights both strengths and limitations of agentic reasoning in perceptualgeometric tasks. Orientation is the only category where agents provide consistent and substantial gains, improving by +8.00% in MCQ and an impressive +36.00% in open evaluation. This pattern suggests that agent-based multi-step reasoning is effective when the task can be decomposed into sequential alignment of directional cues, where structured deliberation offers clear advantage over single-step outputs. 49 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 25: Agent Performance Analysis Category MCQ Normal With Agents Gain Open Evaluation Normal Agent Results 3D Geometry 48.00% Depth & Occlusion 48.00% Orientation 56.00% Relative Positioning 60.00% Size & Scale Spatial Navigation 48.00% 68.00% 44.00% 44.00% 64.00% 60.00% 52.00% 64.00% -4.00% 60.00% -4.00% 40.00% +8.00% 0.00% 0.00% 50.00% +4.00% 25.00% -4.00% 40.00% 48.00% 16.00% 36.00% 36.00% 24.00% 28.00% Overall 54.67% 57.33% +2.66% 35.83% 31.33% Gain -12.00% -24.00% +36.00% -14.00% -1.00% -12.00% -4.50% In contrast, most other categories exhibit negative or neutral gains, revealing that agent reasoning does not universally enhance performance. For example, depth & occlusion suffers severe -24.00% drop in open evaluation, while spatial navigation decreases by -12.00%. These tasks require deeper perceptual grounding in three-dimensional space, and the absence of such priors means that reasoning steps tend to reinforce misconceptions rather than correct them. Similarly, relative positioning shows stagnation in MCQ and -14.00% decline in open evaluation, indicating that agent loops fail to add robustness when relational understanding is inherently weak. Some categories show marginal improvements, such as size & scale (+4.00% in MCQ), but the gains are not stable and do not transfer to open evaluation. Even in 3D geometry, agents fail to provide boost, with -4.00% and -12.00% drops in MCQ and open evaluation, respectively. These results underscore that our benchmark is complex and not solvable simply by layering multi-step agentic reasoning on top of existing models. Instead, it requires deeper integration of geospatial understanding and perceptual representations, which current architectures lack. Overall, the mixed results emphasize that agentic workflows alone are insufficient for advancing performance in this domain. While orientation tasks benefit from structured reasoning, most categories expose the models lack of inherent awareness of perceptual concepts. This makes errors propagate through multi-step reasoning, amplifying performance drops. Consequently, our benchmark serves as strong stress test, highlighting that future progress will require embedding genuine perceptual and geospatial priors rather than relying solely on agent-based reasoning."

            "title": "I QUALITATIVE ERROR ANALYSIS AND ERROR PATTERNS",
            "content": "This section presents focused qualitative analysis of model failures observed in our visual reasoning benchmark. We explain each error class, provide diagnostic root cause analysis, identify recurring patterns, and describe verification protocols. The discussion aims to be both interpretable and actionable, so it can inform future architectural and evaluation design. I.1 OVERVIEW Across the sample set, models achieve strong coarse perception, they can reliably recognize object categories, colors, and simple binary relations, but they break down systematically when multiple cues must be integrated. Failures are not random noise but cluster into small set of interpretable classes: spatial mislocalization, perspective and scale mistakes, occlusion and ordering errors, attribute confusion, and ungrounded open-ended rationalization. These classes recur across architectures and prompting strategies, which suggests that the underlying causes are common inductive biases in current visionlanguage pipelines rather than isolated training artifacts. Importantly, the same error often appears in both large-scale proprietary systems and small open-source baselines, indicating structural weaknesses shared across the model family. In the following, we unpack each error class with representative examples and root-cause hypotheses. 50 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 I.2 ERROR TAXONOMY AND ANALYSIS I.2.1 SPATIAL MISLOCALIZATION AND REFERENCE CONFUSION. Observation. When queries require distinguishing one object from set of visually similar candidates, models frequently misidentify the target. For example, if asked to point out the leftmost red cube among three stacked cubes, the model may incorrectly output the middle cube, influenced by lighting highlights or central positioning. This problem becomes particularly acute in cluttered environments such as kitchen counters or crowded table scenes, where multiple overlapping objects share the same color and shape. In such cases, the models errors are not random: it tends to privilege objects that appear most salient due to size, brightness, or centrality, even when these cues contradict the explicit spatial instructions in the query. These consistent patterns highlight that the failures are systematic, not accidental. Analysis. The recurring mistakes suggest that models lack robust object-centric representation, or what cognitive science would call an index that persists across reasoning steps. Instead of maintaining stable pointer to the correct candidate throughout the reasoning chain, models appear to drift, often reassigning attention to whichever object seems most visually striking at intermediate layers. This leads to reasoning errors such as starting with the leftmost cube but ending the chain with the brightest or largest cube. The inability to anchor spatial reference consistently makes tasks involving relative comparisons, like the ball behind the second chair, particularly fragile. In essence, the model operates more like salience detector than referential reasoner. Root cause. At the architectural level, feature pooling operations, whether via attention or convolution, tend to mix contextual information from neighboring regions. While this is beneficial for global context, it erases the fine-grained, object-specific identity needed to distinguish between similar candidates. Once pooled, features of two adjacent red cubes may be nearly indistinguishable in the latent space. Without an explicit mechanism, such as slot-based representations or pointer tokens, the network collapses distinct entities into blended embeddings. This structural limitation prevents reliable referent tracking across reasoning steps and explains why models consistently confuse dense, overlapping objects. I.2.2 PERSPECTIVE AND SCALE MISTAKES. Observation. Tasks involving metric reasoning about relative size, fit, or scale are inconsistently handled. On simple comparisons like is car larger than bicycle, models typically succeed because such relationships align with strong statistical priors. However, when faced with near-threshold decisions such as will the small sphere fit inside the slightly larger cylinder, errors become frequent and unpredictable. common pattern is reliance on canonical object sizes: for example, predicting that door must be taller than truck even in rendering where the truck is scaled down. Another failure occurs in unusual visualizations, such as toy miniatures or architectural models, where familiar proportions are deliberately inverted. In these cases, models cling to their priors and ignore the actual geometric evidence visible in the image. Analysis. These behaviors indicate that models rely heavily on distributional statistics of object categories rather than performing true geometric inference. Instead of reasoning about projection geometry, relative bounding box sizes, or depth cues, they substitute their world knowledge of typical scales. This shortcut works well in everyday contexts but fails catastrophically in edge cases that deviate from the training distribution. For instance, when an unusually small airplane is rendered next to person, the model still predicts the airplane as larger. Such errors highlight the lack of grounding in pixel-level metric cues and the absence of consistent use of perspective or vanishing points. Root cause. Current architectures do not include explicit geometric reasoning modules that preserve projection-aware relationships. Supervision for scale and fit tasks is limited, so models learn correlations between object category labels and size but not the underlying geometry. Furthermore, training objectives prioritize overall accuracy rather than fine-grained metric consistency, meaning that scale-sensitive errors are under-penalized. Without inductive biases for 3D reasoning or targeted supervision, the model defaults to memorized priors about canonical sizes rather than interpreting the actual perspective geometry in the image. 51 Published as conference paper at ICLR I.2.3 OCCLUSION AND ORDERING FAILURES. Observation. Determining which object is in front, behind, or partially hidden remains core weakness. Models often misreport the foreground object when two animals overlap, or when semitransparent barriers like glass or fences are involved. For instance, in an image where cat sits partially behind curtain, models may incorrectly describe the curtain as being occluded by the cat. Thin or fragile structures, such as wires, tree branches, or railings, are particularly error-prone: they are frequently omitted altogether, leading to wrong answers in questions like what object lies behind the fence. These mistakes occur consistently, especially when occlusion cues are subtle or when the depth difference is small. Analysis. Such failures indicate that models treat depth and occlusion as weak, secondary signals. While the pixel data contains clear occlusion cues (e.g., edge boundaries, T-junctions), the intermediate features learned by the model do not retain them with sufficient resolution. Aggregation layers blur boundaries and downweight thin structures, effectively removing the very cues necessary to resolve ordering. This is why models succeed in gross depth distinctions (foreground vs. background) but collapse in fine-grained cases where partial occlusion must be inferred. In practice, they guess rather than infer, with systematic biases toward treating the visually larger or brighter object as foreground. Root cause. The architecture lacks explicit mechanisms for multi-scale feature retention and has no dedicated supervision for depth or occlusion reasoning. Thin or partially occluded signals are easily lost when features are pooled across large receptive fields. Furthermore, training data often underrepresents subtle occlusion cases, especially those involving transparency or fine boundaries. As result, the learned representations flatten layered scenes into 2D appearance maps, preventing robust construction of depth-aware relational reasoning. I.2.4 ATTRIBUTE CONFUSION AND SEMANTIC SWAP. Observation. Models sometimes conflate perceptual attributes (such as color, texture, or material) with functional or semantic roles. classic example is misjudging whether crosswalk is safe: models may base the answer solely on the presence of painted stripes while ignoring the state of the traffic light or approaching vehicles. Similarly, surface with metallic texture may be misclassified as steel even if it is painted plastic. In tool-use contexts, the presence of handles or familiar shapes may lead the model to infer functionality that the object does not possess. These confusions are frequent in tasks requiring fine-grained visual grounding of attributes. Analysis. These errors reveal that language priors strongly bias the models predictions when visual input is ambiguous. The decoder favors plausible narratives based on co-occurrence in the training data: crosswalks are safe when stripes are visible, shiny textures correspond to metal, and so on. This shortcut allows models to produce semantically coherent answers even when they do not inspect the relevant visual evidence. The result is superficially correct reasoning in familiar contexts but systematic errors in atypical or adversarial scenarios. In practice, this manifests as overfitting to textual stereotypes rather than grounding in perceptual details. Root cause. The underlying training objective, maximizing likelihood of fluent and plausible text, does not enforce visual grounding. As long as the generated answer is semantically reasonable, the loss is minimized, even if the reasoning is incorrect. Consequently, the model is incentivized to substitute common-sense priors for genuine perceptual inference. Without auxiliary losses or verification steps to tie textual claims to image regions, models will continue to swap perceptual and semantic attributes. I.2.5 OPEN-ENDED RATIONALIZATION WITHOUT VERIFICATION. Observation. For explanatory or why-style questions, models often generate coherent but unsupported narratives. For example, when asked why is the object leaning, model might answer because the surface is slippery even though slipperiness cannot be visually inferred. In another case, tilted shelf might be explained as due to an earthquake, claim entirely outside the evidence in the image. These errors highlight tendency to fill gaps with imaginative but ungrounded rationales, producing fluent explanations that mislead users about the true evidence. Analysis. The issue stems from decoupling between text generation and visual grounding. The model generates high-quality language that reads convincingly, but there is no mechanism ensuring that these rationales are tied to actual visual features. Confidence calibration compounds the problem: 52 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 models often assign high certainty to fabricated explanations, giving the false impression of reliability. As result, open-ended outputs may look authoritative while being factually baseless. This mode of failure is particularly concerning in safety-critical domains where plausible but false rationales could misguide decision-making. Root cause. Training is dominated by language-modeling objectives that reward fluency and coherence but not factual grounding. Decoders are optimized to produce the most probable continuation of text given the prompt, without constraints linking the explanation back to specific image evidence. The lack of an explicit verification layer or grounding requirement means that models default to linguistic plausibility over perceptual truth. Without additional architectural or training constraints, open-ended rationalizations will continue to prioritize surface coherence at the expense of evidential accuracy. I.3 ERROR PATTERNS AND CROSS-MODEL SIGNALS When comparing failures across different models, several consistent patterns appear, revealing insights into the underlying mechanisms of errors. One clear trend is that disagreements between models are systematic rather than random: some models consistently rely on geometric cues such as relative size, depth ordering, and occlusion relationships, while others fall back on linguistic priors or commonsense assumptions derived from training text. This leads to predictable divergences, for example when two models give different answers about which object is in front despite seeing the same scene. Errors also spike when multiple cues must be integrated simultaneously. Tasks that require reasoning about occlusion, relative scale, and perspective together are particularly challenging; for instance, understanding whether larger object partially occluding smaller one is in front or behind often triggers consistent mispredictions. Calibration is another noticeable issue: high-confidence predictions frequently correspond to incorrect answers, especially in open-ended explanations or complex spatial queries. These patterns indicate that errors arise from how models balance perceptual grounding and linguistic plausibility. Different architectures exhibit distinct tendencies, some overrely on visual geometry, others overfit to language correlations, so failures are not just isolated mistakes but reflect deeper trade-offs in reasoning strategies. This also implies that any attempt to improve performance should account for both sources of bias simultaneously rather than treating errors as independent events. I.4 MITIGATION STRATEGIES Given these error patterns, several targeted strategies can be pursued to reduce failures without requiring complete architectural redesign. For instance, geometry-aware supervision can be incorporated by adding auxiliary tasks like depth prediction, occlusion ordering, or overlap estimation. This encourages models to respect spatial constraints and improves consistency across predictions. Multi-scale feature retention is another approach: by using edge-aware pooling or attention mechanisms, models can maintain information from thin or partially occluded structures that would otherwise vanish in standard downsampling. Coordinate anchoring can help resolve confusion between viewer-centric and object-centric frames by explicitly representing reference points for relative positioning. Counterfactual augmentation can also be applied, where distractor objects are systematically swapped or perturbed, forcing the model to rely on the true referent cues rather than heuristics. Lightweight verification modules can be added on top of existing outputs, cross-checking claims against visual or geometric constraints to filter implausible predictions. Each of these strategies can be implemented incrementally, providing clear paths to reduce systematic failures while keeping the core model largely unchanged. In addition to these architectural and training augmentations, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers practical pathway to instill more reliable spatial reasoning. By curating datasets that explicitly highlight failure cases, such as near-threshold scale comparisons, occlusion ambiguities, or reference resolution traps, SFT can directly expose models to the edge scenarios where they otherwise default to heuristics. Carefully designed instruction-style fine-tuning further encourages step-by-step reasoning, prompting the model to verbalize intermediate spatial relations rather than skipping to guess. This not only strengthens grounding but also improves interpretability, as errors become traceable to specific reasoning steps. Moreover, SFT can be paired with counterfactual or adversarial augmentations, ensuring that the model does not simply memorize but instead learns invariances to distractors and context shifts. Importantly, these interventions require no wholesale changes to the architecture: they 53 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 adapt existing models by reshaping their inductive biases through supervision. In this sense, SFT serves as lightweight yet powerful complement to geometry-aware and verification-based strategies. In this work, we additionally performed SFT using 40% of the training data and observed clear performance gains, particularly on multiple-choice questions. This suggests that targeted supervision helps models better internalize spatial cues and resolve distractor confusions when answer options are well-defined. However, improvements on open-ended responses were more limited. The model continues to produce fluent but weakly grounded explanations, highlighting that SFT alone cannot fully address rationalization without verification. These findings reinforce the need to combine SFT with geometry-aware supervision, counterfactual augmentations, and lightweight verifiers to achieve balanced progress across both structured and free-form tasks. Our analysis shows that failures are not arbitrary but structured and interpretable, emerging from recurring patterns rather than random noise. This indicates that VLM errors follow systematic trajectories tied to the inductive biases of their architectures and training regimes. For example, geometric reasoning often collapses when occlusion cues are weak, and in such cases language priors take over, producing answers that sound plausible but lack visual grounding. Similarly, scale inference drifts when canonical object size priors dominate over pixel-level metric cues, leading to consistent misjudgments in near-threshold scenarios. These findings highlight that the gap is not simply one of capacity but of representation: current models lack explicit mechanisms to anchor visual features to grounded geometric relations. By adopting the proposed verification protocols and targeted mitigation strategies, researchers can address these weaknesses directly. Geometry-aware supervision and counterfactual augmentation would help models resist shortcuts, while multi-scale feature retention ensures thin structures and partial occlusions are not discarded. SFT, when carefully applied, can further strengthen structured reasoning by aligning model predictions with task constraints, though it must be combined with grounding objectives to avoid overfitting to discrete-choice formats. Importantly, verification modules provide lightweight way to enforce consistency between claimed relations and image evidence, counteracting the tendency to rationalize without checking. Taken together, these steps chart practical pathway toward systems that reason more like humans: robust to clutter, interpretable in their failures, and capable of explaining not only what they predict but why. 54 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 10: Prompts for SPATIOXOLVER (Part 1). 55 Published as conference paper at ICLR Figure 11: Prompts for SPATIOXOLVER (Part 2). 56 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Figure 12: Prompts for SPATIOXOLVER (Part 3). 57 Published as conference paper at ICLR REPRESENTATIVE BENCHMARK SAMPLES ACROSS ALL SUB-CATEGORIES We present representative benchmark samples for all 30 sub-categories in SPATIALAB, illustrating the diverse spatial reasoning challenges covered. These samples highlight the variety of visual phenomena, including 3D geometry, occlusion, orientation, relational positioning, size and scale, and navigation tasks. Together, they provide concrete view of the types of reasoning each model must perform to succeed across the benchmark.

            "content": "To ensure that the benchmark results are not artifacts of random initialization or dataset noise, we evaluate both model robustness across runs and dataset stability across repeated trials. Such analyses are essential for small to medium scale benchmarks, where minor fluctuations can lead to misleading fine-grained conclusions (Drummond, 2009; Drummond & Japkowicz, 2010). Let denote the number of items questions in the benchmark and = 3 the number of independent runs of the same model. Each run uses distinct random seed while preserving all other hyperparameters. K.1 MODEL ROBUSTNESS For checking model evaluation robustness, we perform several statistical studies, as described below. K.1.1 MULTIPLE RUN AVERAGES AND DEVIATIONS Let ai,r 0, 1 denote the correctness of item 1, . . . , in run 1, 2, 3. The per-item average accuracy is: = (cid:88) 1 = 1Rai,r and its corresponding standard deviation is: (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116) 1 1 σi = (cid:88) (ai,r ai)2 r=1 The overall mean accuracy per run is: Ar = 1 (cid:88) i=1 ai,r and its standard deviation across runs is: (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116) 1 1 σA = (cid:88) (Ar A)2 r= where = 1 (cid:80)R r=1 Ar is the overall mean accuracy across all runs. K.1.2 INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION (ICC) (1) (2) (3) (4) To quantify agreement between runs, we compute the Intra-Class Correlation coefficient (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979), using two-way mixed-effects model: ICC(3, k) = between σ2 between + σ2 σ2 within (5) between is the variance between items and σ2 where σ2 within is the residual variance across runs. ICC values above 0.75 indicate good reliability, while values above 0.9 imply excellent consistency (Koo & Li, 2016). K.2 DATASET STABILITY AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY We also analyze the stability of the dataset itself, whether question difficulty remains consistent across runs. 88 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 K.2.1 RESAMPLING STUDY To further assess robustness, we perform resampling analysis. From the total of = 30 subcategories, we randomly sample subsets of size 20, 25 for each sub-category from each of the = 3 runs, across both models and evaluation types (MCQ and open-ended). For each run and subset size S, the accuracy is computed as: Ar,S = 1 (cid:88) i=1 ai,r,S, where ai,r,S denotes the accuracy for subcategory in run under subset size S. The mean accuracy across runs for each subset size is: = (cid:88) 1 = 1RAr,S, and the corresponding standard deviation: σS = (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116) 1 1 (cid:88) r=1 (Ar,S AS)2. (6) (7) (8) As complementary check, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test assesses median differences between paired samples. Let dr = Ar,20 Ar,25 be the difference in accuracies for run r, excluding ties (dr = 0). The test statistic is computed as: = min(W +, ), (9) where + and are the sums of signed ranks of positive and negative differences, respectively. The standardized z-score is given by: = n(n+1) (cid:113) n(n+1)(2n+1) 24 4 , (10) where is the number of nonzero pairs. If the resulting p-value satisfies > 0.05, we again fail to reject H0, confirming that the accuracies from 20and 25-sample subsets are statistically indistinguishable. K.2.2 ITEM-LEVEL CONSISTENCY For each item i, its difficulty can be defined as di = 1 i. If item difficulty is consistent, the correlation between runs should be high: ρ r1, r2 = Cov(a,r1 , a,r2 ) σr1 σr2 (11) high mean pairwise correlation (ρ > 0.8) suggests stable item difficulty and reliable dataset behavior. K.2.3 CRONBACHS ALPHA To measure overall internal consistency, we compute Cronbachs alpha (Cronbach, 1951): α = 1 (cid:32) 1 (cid:33) (cid:80)R r=1 s2 s2 (12) where s2 Values of α 0.9 indicate excellent internal consistency (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011). is the variance of run and s2 is the variance of the total scores aggregated across runs. 89 Published as conference paper at ICLR K.3 EMPIRICAL RESULTS We perform the analysis on two models: one large proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and one small open-source model, Qwen-2.5-vl-7b-Instruct, thereby covering both largeand small-scale models as well as proprietary and open-source paradigms. We also conduct all tests in both multiplechoice (MCQ) and open-ended evaluation formats (treated as binary: correct or incorrect). For statistical analysis, we used the following Python packages and functions: scipy.stats2 (Virtanen et al., 2020) for wilcoxon test; pingouin3 (Vallat, 2018) for intraclass correlation and cronbach alpha; and numpy4s (Harris et al., 2020) numpy.corrcoef for correlations. K.3.1 MODEL EVALUATION ROBUSTNESS Multiple Run Averages and Deviations We analyzed the stability of model accuracy across = 3 independent runs. The standard deviation of accuracy (σA) across runs is negligible (< 0.6%), indicating that the reported scores are precise estimates unaffected by random seeding noise. Table 26: Model Accuracy and Variance across 3 Independent Runs. Format Mean Accuracy ( A) Model Qwen-2.5-vl-7b MCQ Gemini-2.5-Flash MCQ Open Qwen-2.5-vl-7b Gemini-2.5-Flash Open 0.4079 0.5193 0.1936 0.3124 Std Dev (σA) 0.0021 0.0054 0.0047 0.0042 The consistently low standard deviations across all models and evaluation formats indicate that performance estimates are highly stable and reproducible, with minimal sensitivity to stochastic run-to-run variation. This stability suggests that observed accuracy differences meaningfully reflect underlying model capability rather than noise introduced by random initialization or decoding. Notably, although open-ended evaluation exhibits slightly higher variance than MCQ, the absolute magnitude remains negligible, confirming that free-form generation is also robustly assessed under the current protocol. These findings imply that the dataset size and scoring methodology are sufficient to yield convergent accuracy estimates without requiring extensive repeated runs. Consequently, single-run evaluations are likely to be reliable for large-scale comparisons, while multi-run analyses primarily serve to validate robustness. Overall, this strengthens the empirical credibility of the reported results and supports confident cross-model and cross-format performance interpretation. Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) We computed ICC(3,k) to quantify the reliability of the scoring mechanism. Table 27: Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) Reliability Scores. Format Model Qwen-2.5-vl-7b MCQ Gemini-2.5-Flash MCQ Qwen-2.5-vl-7b Open Gemini-2.5-Flash Open ICC(3,k) 0.988 0.990 0.983 0.981 Interpretation Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent The consistently high ICC(3,k) scores demonstrate that the evaluation exhibits near-perfect reliability across independent runs, regardless of model size or response format. This indicates that item-level difficulty ordering is preserved, and that performance fluctuations do not alter relative rankings among samples. Such strong agreement suggests that the scoring pipeline is internally consistent and not sensitive to stochastic variation in model outputs. Importantly, this rules out random guessing as dominant factor, even in open-ended generation, where variability is typically higher. From 2https://scipy.org/ 3https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/index.html 4https://numpy.org/ 90 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 an evaluation standpoint, these results imply that the benchmark provides dependable signal for assessing model capability. Consequently, longitudinal comparisons and fine-grained ablations can be conducted with high confidence in measurement stability. Overall, the combined evidence from multiple-run variance analysis and ICC reliability demonstrates that the evaluation is highly robust to stochastic effects. Both absolute performance (low standard deviation) and relative performance (near-perfect ICC) remain stable across independent runs, confirming that results are not driven by random seeding or decoding noise. This robustness ensures that observed performance gaps across models and formats reflect genuine capability differences. As result, the evaluation framework provides reliable and reproducible basis for comparative analysis and benchmarking. K.3.2 DATASET STABILITY AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY Resampling Study To ensure statistical reliability, this resampling procedure is repeated over 1,000 independent trials, each time drawing new random subsets of size = 20 and = 25 from the available subcategories. Repeating the test at this scale stabilizes the distribution of accuracy differences and p-values, ensuring that conclusions are not driven by particular random draw. The consistent failure to reject H0 across all trials therefore provides strong evidence that the observed robustness is systematic rather than incidental. Table 28: Resampling Study (1,000 Trials): Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (S = 20 vs. = 25). Format Mean p-value % Trials > 0.05 Conclusion Model No Sig. Diff. Qwen-2.5-vl-7b MCQ No Sig. Diff. Gemini-2.5-Flash MCQ No Sig. Diff. Qwen-2.5-vl-7b Open No Sig. Diff. Gemini-2.5-Flash Open 100% 100% 100% 100% 0.290 0.285 0.294 0.294 The resampling results provide strong empirical evidence that accuracy estimates have already converged at relatively small subcategory sizes. The consistently high mean (p)-values and the absence of statistically significant differences across all 1,000 trials indicate that performance metrics are insensitive to moderate reductions in sample size. This stability holds uniformly across models and evaluation formats, suggesting that neither model scale nor output structure introduces additional sampling uncertainty. Importantly, these findings imply that the variance in accuracy is dominated by model behavior rather than data sparsity at the subcategory level. As result, the current subcategory size ( 50) can be considered statistically redundant, offering substantial safety margin beyond the minimum required for reliable estimation. This supports the validity of the benchmark design and suggests that future extensions could reallocate samples across categories without compromising statistical robustness. Item-Level Consistency and Cronbachs Alpha We measured the mean pairwise Pearson correlation (ρ) between runs and Cronbachs Alpha to assess internal consistency. Table 29: Item-Level Consistency Metrics. Format Mean Pairwise ρ Cronbachs α Model Qwen-2.5-vl-7b MCQ Gemini-2.5-Flash MCQ Qwen-2.5-vl-7b Open Gemini-2.5-Flash Open 0.988 0.990 0.983 0.981 0.966 0.972 0.950 0.946 The extremely high mean pairwise correlations (> 0.94) demonstrate strong item-level stability, indicating that the relative difficulty of individual questions is preserved across independent runs. This consistency shows that model responses are systematically structured rather than subject to random variation, even under stochastic decoding. The similarly high Cronbachs α values (> 0.9) further confirm that the dataset exhibits excellent internal coherence, with items contributing reliably to the overall accuracy measure. Notably, the slight reductions observed in open-ended formats are expected given their greater expressive flexibility, yet remain well within the range of excellent reliability. Together, these results indicate that the benchmark functions as unified and internally Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 consistent measurement instrument. Consequently, model performance differences can be confidently attributed to true capability variation rather than instability at the item level. K.3.3 OVERALL DISCUSSION Our expanded statistical testing shows our evlauiton and datset is robust ICC and Cronbachs α scores consistently exceed 0.98, and the standard deviation of accuracy across runs is negligible. Furthermore, the resampling study confirms that even smaller subsets produce statistically indistinguishable results from the full set, proving that our subcategory sizes ( 50) are sufficient for robust conclusions. These results demonstrate that the granular analysis in the paper reflects genuine model capability differences, not statistical noise. Our expanded statistical testing shows that the evaluation protocol and dataset are highly robust, with ICC and Cronbachs α scores consistently exceeding 0.98, indicating near-perfect reliability and internal consistency. The standard deviation of accuracy across runs remains negligible (< 0.6%), confirming that reported model performance is stable and not influenced by stochastic effects such as random seeding or decoding variability. In addition, the resampling study demonstrates that even substantially smaller subsets (N = 20 and = 25) yield statistically indistinguishable accuracy estimates compared to the full set, establishing that the chosen subcategory size ( 25) is well beyond the threshold required for convergence. Collectively, these results show that both absolute scores and relative performance rankings are stable across runs and sampling regimes. This statistical robustness ensures that fine-grained comparisons across models, formats, and subcategories are meaningful. Consequently, the granular analyses reported in the paper reflect genuine differences in model capability rather than artifacts of sampling variance or evaluation noise."
