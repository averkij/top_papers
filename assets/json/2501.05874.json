            "content": "Recently, large foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and their extension to vision modality called Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have become the standard choice for addressing diverse tasks due to their remarkable capabilities (Li et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Dai et al., 2024). In particular, these models, trained on *Equal contribution 1 Figure 1: conceptual illustration of existing and the proposed RAG scenarios. (A) Textual RAG retrieves documents (relevant to queries) from text corpus and incorporates them when generating answers. (B) Conventional multimodal RAG extends retrieval to include static images. (C) VIDEORAG (ours) further extends the external knowledge source to videos. extensive textual and multimodal corpora, encode vast amounts of knowledge within their large-scale parameters. However, despite their success, they are still prone to generating factually incorrect outputs, known as hallucination, as their parametric knowledge can be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated (Lewis et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023), and this limitation highlights the need for incorporating knowledge from external knowledge sources, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as an essential mitigator for it. Specifically, RAG typically operates by retrieving query-relevant information from an external corpus and then generating answers grounded in the retrieved information (Niu et al., 2024; Ayala and Béchard, 2024). However, while existing RAG approaches have been widely adopted for various real-world applications, they have primarily focused on retrieving and incorporating textual content (Ram et al., 2023; Jeong et al., 2024a), with only recent attempts beginning to explore images (or text-image pairs) as the additional source of external knowledge (Yu et al., 2024; Riedler and Langer, 2024). On the other hand, we argue that there remains rapidly expanding yet underutilized medium, called videos, which provides unparalleled multimodal richness, and they may be compelling resource for augmenting the knowledge landscape of current RAG systems. Specifically, videos combine temporal dynamics, spatial details, and multimodal cues, which collectively enable them to capture complex processes, context-dependent interactions, and nonverbal signals that static modalities (such as text and images) often fail to convey. Moreover, given the increasing popularity of video-sharing platforms (such as YouTube and TikTok), the availability of diverse, high-quality video data has grown significantly, ranging from educational tutorials and scientific demonstrations to personal experiences and real-time events, all of which may be useful when formulating responses to user queries. It is worth noting that few very recent studies have started considering video content to handle user queries; however, they have notable limitations. For instance, some of them assume that the video relevant to queries is already known and instead focus on identifying query-relevant frames from within that specified video (Luo et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024). While this approach may work for scenarios where the relevant video is explicitly provided, it is suboptimal for more general-use cases, where users expect the system to dynamically identify and retrieve relevant video content to provide the answer. On the other hand, other studies handle videos by converting them into textual formats, such as subtitles or captions, and utilizing these textual representations under off-the-shelf text-based RAG pipelines (Arefeen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b). However, while this text-only strategy may offer convenient workaround, it inherently sacrifices the multimodal richness of video data by discarding critical information, such as temporal dynamics and visual context, during the conversion process, which may be essential. For example, consider query: How does the expression of the dog change when it is angry?. While textual transcriptions might describe the dogs barking or growling, they fail to capture visual cues (baring teeth, raised hackles, or narrowed eyes), which are needed for accurately interpreting the emotional state of the dog as well as formulating the answer to the query. In this work, to address the aforementioned limitations of existing studies, we introduce novel framework, called VideoRAG, which aims to offer another fruitful angle to existing RAG frameworks by enabling more comprehensive utilization of video content for its holistic retrieval and incorporation (See Figure 1 for its illustation and comparison to existing works). Specifically, in response to queries, the proposed VideoRAG not only retrieves relevant videos from large video corpus, but also integrates both visual and textual elements of videos into the answer-generation process. Furthermore, we operationalize this by harnessing the advanced capabilities of recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which are capable of directly processing the video content, consisting of visual and textual information, within the unified framework, thereby more effectively capturing its multimodal richness. However, while on the one hand, we observe that the joint utilization of visual and textual features is needed for the effective representation of videos and subsequently their retrieval, on the other hand, the textual descriptions of videos (e.g., subtitles) are oftentimes not available. To address this, we further present simple yet effective mitigation strategy that utilizes automatic speech recognition techniques to generate textual transcripts from videos, which allows us to leverage both visual and textual modalities even when explicit textual annotations are absent. To validate the effectiveness of our VideoRAG framework, we conduct experiments by leveraging the overlapping queries from the WikiHowQA dataset (Bolotova-Baranova et al., 2023) (consisting of query-answer pairs) with the queries from the HowTo100M dataset (Miech et al., 2019) (including query-video pairs without answers). Then, the experimental results show the significant performance improvement of the proposed VideoRAG framework over relevant RAG baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging videos for RAG."

            "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG aims to enhance the capabilities of foundation models by 2 grounding their outputs in external knowledge retrieved from the external knowledge source, such as Wikipedia, which consists of two main components: retrieval and generation modules. Formally, given query q, RAG retrieves set of documents (or knowledge elements) = {k1, k2, . . . , kk} from an external corpus (K C) based on their relevance with using retrieval module, which can be formalized as follows: = Retriever(q, C). Here, the query and knowledge are represented as sequence of tokens = [q1, q2, . . . , qi] and = [k1, k2, . . . , kj]. Also, during retrieval, the relevance between the query and each knowledge element within the corpus is determined by the scoring function, defined as follows: Sim(q, k), which typically measures their representational similarity over the embedding space. In the subsequent generation step, the retrieved knowledge elements are then used as additional input to the generation module, to augment the query to produce an answer y, which can be defined as follows: = Model(q, K), where Model is typically implemented as the foundation model, such as LLMs. It is worth noting that, unlike existing RAG frameworks that focus mainly on retrieving and incorporating textual content (or, in some recent cases, extra static images), in this work, we explore the extension toward videos. Large Video Language Models On top of the extensive language understanding capabilities of LLMs, LVLMs are designed to handle and incorporate the features from video content, including temporal, spatial, and multimodal information, within the unified token processing framework. Formally, let us denote video as sequence of image frames: = [v1, v2, . . . , vn] and its associated textual data (such as subtitles, or any other textual information such as the video-specific query) as sequence of tokens: = [t1, t2, . . . , tm]. Then, the typical LVLM, denoted as LVLM, enables the joint processing of these multimodal inputs by employing two specialized components: vision encoder and text encoder. Specifically, the vision encoder processes the sequence of video frames (which can span multiple videos) to extract temporal and spatial features, resulting in sequence of visual feature embeddings (or visual tokens): Fvisual = VisionEncoder(V ). Concurrently, the text encoder processes the given textual information to generate corresponding feature embeddings: Ftext = TextEncoder(t). Then, the overall process to obtain the video representation (with the goal of capturing both visual and textual features) can be denoted as follows: fvideo = LVLM(V , t). Traditionally, fvideo is obtained by the simple interpolation of the visual and textual representations: fvideo = α Ftext + (1 α) Fvisual (Xu et al., 2021), and, more recently, it can be done by further jointly processing the visual and textual embeddings through several LVLM layers (that sit on top of existing LLMs) (Zhang et al., 2024c), which allows the model to learn more effective representation and continue generating the next sequence of tokens (for example, an answer to query)."

            "content": "We now turn to introduce our VideoRAG, which extends the existing RAG paradigm by leveraging the video corpus as the external knowledge source. Video Retrieval The initial step to operationalize RAG over the video corpus is to implement video retrieval, whose goal is to identify query-relevant videos = {V1, V2, . . . , Vk} from the external corpus C, consisting of large number of videos, formalized as follows: = Retriever(q, C). Recall that, as explained in Section 2.1, this retrieval process involves calculating the similarity between the query and each knowledge element (which is video in our case) to determine their relevance. To achieve this, we first forward the video (composed of image frames and, if available, subtitles) as well as the query (without visual information) into LVLM, to obtain their representations fquery and fvideo. After that, the relevance is computed based on their representation-level similarity, for example, using cosine similarity, and then the top-k videos with the highest similarity scores are retrieved for the subsequent answer generation step. Video-Augmented Response Generation After the retrieval of query-relevant videos is done, the next step is to incorporate the retrieved videos into the answer generation process, in order to formulate the answer grounded in them. To operationalize this, we first concatenate the frames of each retrieved video with its associated textual data (e.g., subtitles), then concatenate these multimodal pairs across all videos retrieved, and lastly append the user query, to construct the input to LVLM, denoted as follows: [V1, t1, . . . , Vk, tk, q]. Then, this input is forwarded into LVLM, which enables the joint processing of the combined visual, textual, and queryspecific information, to generate the response while considering their multimodal richness."

VideoRAG We introduce and validate three variants of the proposed VideoRAG framework, each employing the same video retrieval method but differing in how the retrieved videos are incorporated during answer generation. Specifically, the first variant, VIDEORAG-T, integrates only the transcripts (or auxiliary textual data) obtained from retrieved videos as context for answer generation. Meanwhile, the second variant, VIDEORAGV, exclusively utilizes video frames as context to provide visual grounding for responses. Finally, VIDEORAG-VT jointly utilizes both the video frames and textual transcripts for generation.

To achieve this, for retrieval, we use InternVideo2 (Wang et al., 2024c) since it is explicitly trained to align semantics between videos and their textual descriptions. Specifically, we use its video and text encoders to extract embeddings for videos and text, respectively. On the other hand, for video-augmented answer generation, we use LLaVA-Video-7B (Zhang et al., 2024c), which is known for achieving state-of-theart performance on video understanding and relevant tasks. For efficiency, we uniformly sample 4 frames per video for retrieval, while we sample 32 frames (or all frames if the video is shorter than 32 seconds, sampled at 1 fps) for generation.

First, we observe that all RAG models, utilizing external knowledge, clearly outperform the NAÏVE baseline, reaffirming the critical role of external knowledge in enhancing the factual accuracy of generated responses. Also, among these, our VIDEORAG achieves the highest performance, significantly surpassing existing Table 2: Generation results using different set of videos, such as Random that randomly samples videos, Retrieved that selects videos according to their relevance with queries, and Oracle that uses the ground truth videos annotated in data.

This improvement corroborates our hypothesis that video content may be useful resource for RAG, as it provides richer and more detailed information than textual resources. Then, one might ask whether the performance improvement of the proposed VideoRAG framework comes from the consideration of the additional modality (e.g., video frames) rather than the actual content within the retrieved knowledge. To investigate this, we compare TEXTVIDEORAG and VIDEORAG-T, which utilize textual representations of videos (without vision modality), against TEXTRAG that uses the encyclopedic knowledge base in text (namely, Wikipedia) as the knowledge source. As shown in Table 1, we find that the improved performance of VIDEORAG-T and TEXTVIDEORAG over TEXTRAG suggests that, even if we use only the textual representations of videos, the content embedded in videos is proved to be more fruitful to enhance the response quality than the general encyclopedic knowledge. Additionally, despite the superior performance of TEXTVIDEORAG and VIDEORAG-T to baselines, they are outperformed by the other variants of our VideoRAG, which directly incorporate visual features into the answer generation process. This result further highlights the critical role of visual information in performance. Finally, the smaller performance gap between VIDEORAG-V and VIDEORAG-VT suggests that much of the necessary information required for answer generation is effectively encapsulated within the visual features of video frames, which inherently include information conveyed through textual descriptions.

            "content": "Impact of Video Retrieval We hypothesize that the quality of the retrieved videos is critical factor in the success of RAG, as it can directly influence the subsequent answer generation process. To confirm this, we compare the performance of VideoRAG with different videos, including randomly selected videos and retrieved videos (relevant to queries), used for augmenting the answer generation step. As shown in Table 2, we then observe that incorporating query-relevant videos significantly improves the quality of the answers compared to randomly selected videos, demonstrating the importance of retrieval quality. Furthermore, the Oracle setting, which represents an ideal scenario with perfectly relevant video retrieval, achieves the highest performance, highlighting the potential for further improvements through advancements in video retrieval mechanisms within our VideoRAG. Effectiveness of Textual and Visual Features When performing video retrieval, it is questionable how much different modalities, such as textual features, visual features, or combination of both, contribute to the effectiveness of video representations, and we report retrieval results with varying modalities in Table 3. From this, we observe that textual features consistently outperform visual features, likely due to their stronger semantic alignment with textual user queries. To further examine this, we visualize the embeddings of textual and visual features of video content as well as queries over the latent space in Figure 3, and it clearly reveals closer proximity between textual query embeddings and textual video representations compared to visual video representations. In other words, visual features exhibit modality gap relative to text-based queries (as reflected in their greater distance), resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. Nevertheless, combining textual and visual features achieves the highest performance, demonstrating the complementary nature of those two modalities in video representations for retrieval. Analysis on Feature Ensemble To better understand the contribution of textual and visual features in video retrieval, we analyze how varying their combination ratio (α) impacts performance across different metrics. As shown in Figure 2, we find that the optimal ratio for balancing textual and visual features is around 0.5 to 0.7 (with marginal variations depending on the specific metric: 0.7 for R@1 and R@5; 0.5 for R@10). These results further highlight the complementary contributions of textual and visual features in video representations for retrieval, while slight emphasis on textual features might be preferable due to the modality gap observed in Figure 3. Lastly, based on this analysis, we select α = 0.7 for our experiments. 6 Table 4: Case study comparing NAÏVE and VIDEORAG-V approaches.

            "content": "Category-Wise Performance Analysis To evaluate the robustness of our VideoRAG across diverse query types, we breakdown the model performance on 10 distinct categories (annotated within WikiHow). Then, as shown in Figure 4, the family of the proposed VideoRAG (such as VIDEORAG-T and VIDEORAG-V) outperforms all other baselines across all categories, which highlights its ability to handle wide range of queries. Also, it is worth noting that VIDEORAG-V shows notable performance improvement in the Food & Entertaining category, and this is particularly reasonable given that the questions in this category often benefit significantly from visual details, for example, the query: How to make healthy spinach and garlic dish requires ingredient preparation or cooking techniques, which are not effectively conveyed through text alone. Thus, the results in this category reaffirm the importance of leveraging video content as external knowledge for RAG. Ablation Studies To analyze how performance varies with different knowledge sources, we conduct ablation studies and present the results in Table 5. We then find that, while incorporating external knowledge (whether from textual encyclopedic sources or video corpus) consistently improves performance over the NAÏVE baseline, the approach that jointly uses videos with general textual documents achieves slightly degraded performance. This suggests that textual content (retrieved from the encyclopedic knowledge base) may introduce redundant or irrelevant details, which may overlap with or contradict the information provided by video content, leading to diminishing the effectiveness of the VideoRAG framework. Qualitative Results We now qualitatively analyze the effectiveness of VideoRAG through case study, with the query: Explain how to bake cookies on your car dashboard. As shown in Table 4, the NAÏVE baseline, relying solely on its parametric knowledge, generates generic response highlighting the impracticality and safety concerns of such method, failing to provide the step-by-step instructions necessary to address the query. It indicates the limitation of parametric knowledge that is inadequate especially when specific and uncommon information is required.

Vally Wiselthier, an art deco ceramicist who was making pieces for General Ceramics in Keasbey, New Jersey. After seeing her preliminary pieces, Erni gave Rose membership at Greenwich House, where she learned how to use potters wheel. Shortly after their first son George was born, he was found to have intractable asthma. The Cabats decided to move to Arizona around 1942 in order to alleviate his condition. During World War II Rose worked as riveter at the Davis-Monthan Army Air Field repairing war-damaged aircraft. Rose was able to make primitive ceramics from the extra clay that Erni The document does not provide step-by-step guide on how to make clay rose. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that Rose learned how to use potters wheel at Greenwich House after seeing Vally Wiselthiers preliminary pieces. This suggests that she may have received some training or instruction in pottery from Vally Wiselthier or other instructors at Greenwich House. To make clay rose, you would need to follow these general steps: 1. Gather materials: You will need clay, potters wheel, wire cutter, sponge, and any additional materials you want to use for decoration (such as glaze, paint, or glitter). 2. Prepare the clay: Cut piece of clay to the desired size and shape for your rose. Use wire cutter to trim any excess clay and smooth out any rough edges. 3. Shape the clay: Use your hands or tools to shape the clay into rose. You can start by creating small ball of clay for the center of the rose, then add petals around it. Use sponge to smooth out any rough areas and refine the shape of the rose. 4. Add details: Use tool or your fingers to add details to the petals, such as veins or shading. You can also use additional materials like glaze, paint, or glitter to decorate the rose. 5. Allow the clay to dry: Let the clay dry completely before firing it in kiln. This will help prevent any cracking or breaking during the firing process. 6. Fire the clay: Place the dried clay rose in kiln and fire it according to the manufacturers instructions. This will harden the clay and create durable piece of pottery. 7. Glaze or finish: Once the clay is fired, you can apply glaze or finish to give the rose glossy or matte appearance. Allow the glaze to dry and cure before handling the finished piece. Its important to note that this is general guide and the specific steps may vary depending on the type of clay you are using and the techniques you are employing. Its also important to follow safety guidelines when working with clay and kilns. Question Retrieved Video Explain how to make clay rose. VideoRAG-V Generated Answer Ground Truth To make clay rose, start by rolling out piece of clay into flat sheet. Use rolling pin to flatten the clay further. Then, use knife or sculpting tool to cut the clay into petal shapes. Roll the petals into spiral shape to form the rose. Use small tool to create indentations in the petals for texture. Assemble the petals around central stem, shaping them to resemble rose. Add leaves and other details as desired. Finally, use mold to imprint patterns onto the petals, adding depth and realism to the rose. To make clay rose, start by rolling chunk of clay into ball, dividing the ball into seven similarly-sized pieces, and rolling those pieces into balls. Take the smallest ball and press it into guitar-pick-shaped petal with the pointy part thicker than the rounded part, then fold the sides gently inward. Repeat with slightly bigger ball of clay, then fold this second petal around the first. Continue attaching slightly larger petals in spiral, then pinch the bottom of your rose to connect all the petals. retrieves relevant instructional video that illustrates the process of baking cookies on car dashboard, and, by leveraging this, it successfully generates detailed response similar to the ground truth.

            "content": "Furthermore, we observe that external textual knowledge alone can sometimes fall short in providing relevant and actionable information for specific procedural queries, such as Explain how to make clay rose. Specifically, as shown in Table 6, TEXTRAG (BM25) retrieves an irrelevant document about person named Rose, as Wikipedia does not contain specific procedural guidance on this topic, Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG is strategy that combines retrieval and generation processes to produce accurate answers by grounding them in relevant external knowledge (Lewis et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024). To be specific, during the retrieval step, documents (relevant to queries) are selected from large corpus by calculating their similarity to the query, which can 8 be done by using either sparse methods (Robertson et al., 1994; Jones, 2004) based on lexical overlaps or dense methods (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022) that leverage semantic representations. In the subsequent generation step, these retrieved documents serve as input for generating answers that are rooted in the provided information, with the generation process (as well as retrieval) varying depending on the specific work (Jiang et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2024; Hwang et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024), for example, incorporating iterative retrieval-generation cycles (Trivedi et al., 2023) or adapting different RAG strategies based on query complexity (Jeong et al., 2024a). However, despite the fact that much of the real-world knowledge is inherently multimodal in nature (Lee et al., 2024; Jeong et al., 2024b; Faysse et al., 2024), the majority of current RAG studies have focused preliminary on the textual modality, with little effort on incorporating images, leaving significant gap in leveraging the full spectrum of available knowledge for the holistic operation of RAG. Multimodal RAG Recently, there has been growing interest in expanding RAG systems to incorporate multimodal information (beyond textual documents), such as images (Chen et al., 2022; Lin and Byrne, 2022; Riedler and Langer, 2024; Yu et al., 2024), code (Guo et al., 2024), tables (Pan et al., 2022; Biswal et al., 2024), and audio (Yuan et al., 2024). However, in contrast to them, videos offer unique and orthogonal advantage for advancing RAG systems, as they encapsulate temporal dynamics, spatial details, and multimodal cues in ways unmatched by other modalities. Inspired by this, very recent studies have begun exploring the usage of video content within RAG pipelines; however, despite these efforts, existing approaches leverage the distinct advantages of video data in suboptimal way. Specifically, some focus on extracting queryrelevant frames from preselected video and generating answers based on them, which, while useful in controlled scenarios, limits their real-world applicability in open-domain settings (Luo et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024). Also, other approaches attempt to sidestep the complexity of handling video data by converting it into textual representations (such as subtitles or captions); however, while directly applicable to existing text-based RAG frameworks, they sacrifice the multimodal richness embedded within videos (such as temporal dynamics and spatial patterns) (Arefeen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Ma et al., 2024). To address these challenges, we propose VideoRAG that is capable of dynamically retrieving and holistically utilizing video content in RAG, powered by LVLMs discussed next. Large Video Language Models Building on the remarkable success of LLMs in language understanding and generation as well as their ability to encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024), there has been growing interest in extending them to encompass diverse modalities, such as images (Lin et al., 2024; Bordes et al., 2024; Zhu and Zhang, 2025) and code (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024; Hui et al., 2024). Furthermore, this expansion has recently extended to another modality called video, leading to the emergence of LVLMs that are capable of directly processing video content. In particular, these models excel in solving traditionally challenging (yet straightforward) tasks, such as object or action detection (Tang et al., 2023), and their capabilities have been rapidly advanced, enabling them to tackle more challenging tasks, such as analyzing spatio-temporal dynamics to predict the sequence of events, inferring causal relationships across video frames, and generating context-aware descriptions of intricate scenarios (Wang et al., 2024a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; He et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b), even in zero-shot settings without additional training (Chen et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024). However, despite these advancements, their potential has yet to be explored in the context of RAG; thus, in this work, we aim to bridge this gap with the proposal of VideoRAG."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "In this work, we presented VideoRAG, novel framework that expands the current landscape of RAG systems by leveraging video corpus as the external knowledge source. Specifically, unlike existing works that use the textual representations of videos or assume the existence of query-relevant videos without retrieval, the proposed VideoRAG retrieves videos based on their relevance to queries but also integrates their multimodal richness (including visual and textual elements) into the RAG pipeline, by harnessing the capabilities of LVLMs. Also, through comprehensive analyses, we demonstrated how the inclusion of visual or textual features, or combination of both, improves retrieval and generation performance, and, inspired by the critical role of textual features (for retrieval quality) 9 but their absence in some videos, we presented simple yet effective mitigator that uses automatic speech recognition to generate textual transcripts. Overall, experimental results validated the superiority of our VideoRAG over existing RAG methods, and we believe it makes significant step toward holistic RAG systems that can utilize videos."
