            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as the foundational backbone for multimodal AI systems, enabling autonomous agents to perceive the visual world, reason over multimodal content (Yue et al., 2024b), and interact with both digital (Xie et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025) and physical environments (Zitkovich et al., 2023; Black et al., 2024). The significance of these capabilities has motivated extensive exploration across multiple dimensions, including novel architectural designs (Alayrac et al., 2022; Team, 2024; Ye et al., 2025) and innovative training methodologies with optimized data recipes (Karamcheti et al., 2024; Dai et al., 2024), leading to rapid progress in the field (Liu et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025a). In this report, we share our efforts to build compact yet powerful VLM, MiMo-VL-7B. MiMoVL-7B comprises three components: (1) native-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder that preserves fine-grained visual details, (2) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) projector for efficient cross-modal alignment, and (3) our MiMo-7B (Xiaomi, 2025) language model, specifically optimized for complex reasoning tasks. The development of MiMo-VL-7B involves two sequential training processes: (1) four-stage pre-training phase, which includes projector warmup, vision-language alignment, general multimodal pre-training, and long-context Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Throughout these stages, we curate high-quality datasets by strategically combining open-source collections with synthetic data generation techniques, consuming 2.4 trillion tokens, adjusting the dataset distribution in different stages to facilitate training. This phase yields the MiMo-VL-7B-SFT model. (2) subsequent post-training phase, where we introduce Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning (MORL), novel framework that seamlessly integrates diverse reward signals spanning perception accuracy, visual grounding precision, logical reasoning capabilities, and human preferences. We adopt the idea of GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) and enhance training stability by exclusively performing on-policy gradient updates during this stage. This phase yields the MiMo-VL-7B-RL model. During this journey, we find: (1) Incorporating high-quality, broad-coverage reasoning data from the pre-training stage In the current era of thinking models, vast is crucial for enhancing model performance. quantities of multimodal pre-training data are undergoing significant re-evaluation. Traditional question-answering (QA) data, with its direct, short answers, often restricts models to superficial pattern matching and leads to overfitting. In contrast, synthesized reasoning data with long Chainof-Thought (CoT) enables learning of complex logical relationships and generalizable reasoning patterns, providing richer supervision signals that markedly improve both performance and training efficiency. To leverage this advantage, we curate high-quality reasoning data by identifying diverse queries, employing large reasoning models to regenerate responses with long CoT, and applying rejection sampling to ensure quality. Furthermore, rather than treating this as supplementary fine-tuning data, we incorporate substantial volumes of this synthetic reasoning data directly into the later pre-training stages, where extended training yields continued performance improvements without saturation. (2) Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning further enhances model performance, while achieving stable simultaneous improvements remains challenging. We apply RL across diverse capabilities, including reasoning, perception, grounding, and human preference alignment, spanning modalities including text, images, and videos. While this hybrid training approach further unlocks the models potential, interference across data domains remains challenging. Disparities in the growth trends of response length and task difficulty levels hinder stable, simultaneous improvements across all capabilities. 4 MiMo-VL-7B-RL delivers exceptional results across the full spectrum of multimodal capabilities. (1) On fundamental visual perception tasks, it achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs of comparable scale, scoring 66.7 on MMMU (Yue et al., 2024b) and outperforming Qwen2.5-VL-7B (Bai et al., 2025a) on 35 out of 40 evaluated tasks. (2) For complex multimodal reasoning, MiMo-VL-7B-RL exhibits outstanding performance, scoring 59.4 on OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024) and surpassing models up to 72B parameters. (3) In GUI grounding for agentic applications, our model sets new standard by achieving score of 54.7 on OSWorld-G (Xie et al., 2025), even exceeding specialized models like UI-TARS (Qin et al., 2025b). (4) In terms of user experience and preference, MiMo-VL-7B-RL achieves the highest Elo rating among all open-source VLMs on our in-house user preference evaluation, performing competitively with proprietary models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet. These results validate our approach: by combining strong perception, sophisticated reasoning, and precise grounding capabilities through our MORL framework, MiMo-VL-7B-SFT and MiMo-VL7B-RL establish new standards for open-source vision-language models. To promote transparency and reproducibility, we also contribute comprehensive evaluation suite covering 50+ tasks with complete prompts and protocols, enabling the community to build upon our work."

To support native resolution inputs, we adopt Qwen2.5-ViT (Bai et al., 2025a) as our visual encoder. We initialize the LLM backbone with MiMo-7B-Base (Xiaomi, 2025) to leverage its strong reasoning capability, and utilize randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the projector.

            "title": "2.2 Pre-training Data",
            "content": "The MiMo-VL-7B pre-training dataset comprises 2.4 trillion tokens of high-quality, diverse multimodal data spanning images, videos, and text. This comprehensive dataset includes general image captions, interleaved data, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) data, grounding data, video content, GUI interactions, reasoning examples, and text-only sequences. To ensure the quality of each data modality, we implement dedicated data curation pipelines tailored to the characteristics of each data type. Throughout the training process, we systematically adjust the proportions of different data modalities across various training stages to optimize both training efficiency and model stability. Additionally, we employ phash-based image deduplication to eliminate potential overlaps between our training datasets and evaluation benchmarks, thereby minimizing data contamination. We detail the specific processing procedures for each data type in the following sections. 2.2.1 Image Caption Data The construction of our image caption dataset involves multi-stage process designed to ensure high quality and distributional balance. We begin by aggregating substantial volume of publicly available caption data from web sources. This initial corpus then undergoes rigorous deduplication phase, employing image perceptual hashing (phash) in conjunction with text filtering, to yield refined set of unique raw captions. Subsequently, leveraging both the images and their original textual descriptions as priors, we utilize specialized captioning model to re-caption the entire raw caption dataset. Following re6 captioning, we apply filtering mechanisms to the generated captions based on linguistic consistency and repetition patterns to ensure the quality of the re-captioned text. To address inherent data imbalances, we adopt the methodology of MetaCLIP (Xu et al., 2023), which involves constructing novel bilingual (Chinese and English) metadata. This critical step serves to refine the caption distribution, thereby mitigating the over-representation of high-frequency entries and reducing dataset noise. The culmination of this meticulous process is balanced, high-quality, and diverse caption dataset. Crucially, we observe that this rich dataset significantly enhances model generalization and qualitative performance, offering advantages not always fully reflected in evaluations on existing, specialized benchmarks. 2.2.2 Interleaved Data We compile an extensive corpus of interleaved image-text data from diverse sources, including webpages, books, and academic papers. For content originating from books and papers, we employ advanced PDF parsing toolkits for content extraction and cleansing. The filtering process prioritizes and retains data types rich in world knowledge, such as textbooks, encyclopedias, manuals, guides, patents, and biographies. Within this interleaved dataset, textual segments are evaluated based on metrics including knowledge density and readability. For the visual components, we implement filters to exclude images of diminutive size, anomalous aspect ratios, unsafe content, and those with minimal visual information (e.g., decorative chapter headings and illustrations). Finally, image-text pairs are scored on relevance, complementarity, and the balance of information density, ensuring the retention of high-quality data. This curated dataset significantly augments the models knowledge repository, thereby establishing robust foundation for its subsequent reasoning capabilities. 2.2.3 OCR and Grounding Data To enhance the models capabilities in OCR and object grounding, we compile an extensive corpus of OCR and grounding data from open-source datasets for pre-training. For the OCR data, the images encompass diverse textual content from documents, tables, general scenes, product packaging, and mathematical formulas. To increase learning difficulty, in addition to standard printed text, we specifically incorporate images containing handwritten script, typographically deformed text, and blurry/occluded text, thereby improving the models recognition performance and robustness. For portion of this data, textual regions are annotated with bounding boxes, enabling the model to simultaneously predict these locations. For the grounding data, our images feature scenarios with both single and multiple objects. We further improve the models capacity to comprehend complex referential intentions by employing intricate object expressions within localization prompts. In all scenarios involving localization, we use absolute coordinates for representation. 2.2.4 Video Data Our video dataset primarily draws from publicly available online videos, spanning wide array of domains, genres, and durations. Based on the videos, we design video re-captioning pipeline that produces dense, fine-grained event-level descriptions. Each caption is temporally grounded with precise start and end timestamps, enabling the model to develop general video perception with time-awareness. From the caption dataset, we further collect subset with balanced distribution of event durations for temporal grounding pretraining. We also curate video analysis data that 7 summarize the global semantics of videos, such as narrative structures, stylistic elements, and implicit intentions. These analytical paragraphs enable the model to grasp in-depth comprehension of videos and extended world knowledge. To enhance the models conversational coherence, we collect diverse and challenging questions about videos and synthesize corresponding responses. We also incorporate open-source video captioning and conversation datasets to further enrich our video pretraining data. 2.2.5 Graphical User Interface Data To enhance the models capabilities in navigating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), we collect open-source pre-training data covering all sorts of platforms such as mobile, web, and desktop. synthetic data engine is also devised to compensate for the limitations of open-source data and to strengthen specific aspects of the models capabilities. For example, we have constructed vast amount of Chinese GUI data to enable the model to better handle Chinese GUI scenarios. For GUI Grounding, we gather data for both element grounding and instruction grounding. Element grounding trains the model to precisely locate interface elements based on textual descriptions, establishing robust perception of static user interfaces. Instruction grounding requires the model to identify target objects on screenshots according to user instructions, enhancing comprehension of GUI interaction logic. For this part, we additionally introduce pre-training task that involves predicting intermediate actions based on before-and-after screenshots. Empirical evidence demonstrates that this approach significantly improves the models dynamic perception of GUI interfaces. For GUI Action, we collect large scale of long GUI action trajectories. To ensure consistency across different platforms, we unified actions from mobile, web, and desktop environments into standardized action space. detailed specification of this action space is provided in Appendix D. This harmonization prevents action conflicts while maintaining platform-specific functionality. 2.2.6 Synthetic Reasoning Data Our approach to generating synthetic reasoning data begins with the comprehensive curation of open-source questions. This diverse collection spans perceptual question answering, document question answering, video question answering, and visual reasoning tasks, supplemented by question-answer pairs derived from web content and literary works. Following initial filtering of these source questions, we leverage large reasoning model to produce answers that integrate explicit reasoning. cornerstone of our methodology is rigorous, multi-stage quality control. Beyond verifying the factual correctness of answers, we apply strict filtering criteria to the reasoning processes themselves, evaluating clarity of thought, eliminating redundancy, and ensuring consistent formatting. The resulting high-fidelity dataset plays critical role in empowering our model. It facilitates the effective inheritance of strong reasoning abilities inherent in MiMo-7B-Base (Xiaomi, 2025), enabling their seamless transfer and adaptation to multimodal contexts. Consequently, this allows our model to exhibit powerful and versatile multimodal reasoning capabilities across broad array of domains."

            "title": "2.3 Pre-training Stages",
            "content": "Our model undergoes four pre-training stages as illustrated in Table 1: Stage 1: We freeze the ViT and LLM components, and warm up the randomly initialized projector 8 using image-caption pairs. This ensures the projector learns to map visual concepts to the language models representation space effectively, providing informative gradient signals for subsequent training stages rather than noisy updates from poorly aligned projector. Stage 2: The ViT is then unfrozen, and interleaved data is introduced to further strengthen vision-language alignment. The inclusion of complex and diverse images within the interleaved data enhances the ViTs performance and robustness. Stage 3: In this stage, all parameters are trainable. We introduce more diverse array of data and tasks, including OCR, grounding, video, and GUI dataaccumulating to 1.4 trillion tokensto bolster the models general multimodal capabilities. To ensure stable mid-stage evaluation monitoring, small quantities of QA, instruction-following, and reasoning data are incorporated. Furthermore, limited amount of text-only data is utilized to preserve MiMo-7BBases textual capability. Stage 4: This stage is dedicated to enhancing the models adaptability to long-context inputs. The training sequence length is extended from 8K to 32K tokens. We introduce additional data types such as long pure text, high-resolution images, long documents, extended videos, and long reasoning data to augment its long-context processing capabilities. As long-context packing significantly increases the effective batch size, the learning rate is adjusted from 1e-5 to 2.5e5. Relative to Stage 3, this stage features markedly increased proportion of reasoning data, alongside the introduction of long-form reasoning patterns. These four stages create powerful model, MiMo-VL-7B-SFT. With particular emphasis on Stage 4, the models reasoning capabilities are fully realized, enabling it to address highly intricate STEM problems. This advanced reasoning aptitude also generalizes effectively to common perception tasks. Consequently, our model demonstrates exceptionally high performance across various downstream benchmarks."

In the post-training of MiMo-VL-7B, we design multiple verifiable reasoning and perception tasks where final solutions can be precisely validated using predefined rules. Visual Reasoning Visual reasoning capabilities are fundamental for multimodal models to understand and solve complex problems that require both visual perception and logical thinking. To facilitate this capability, we compile diverse verifiable STEM questions from open-source communities and proprietary K-12 collections. An LLM is prompted to filter proof-based problems and rewrite multiple-choice questions with numerical or symbolic answers into free-answer formats, alleviating potential reward hacking. We further refine question quality through comprehensive model-based difficulty assessment, excluding questions that either cannot be solved by advanced 9 VLMs or are too easy, with MiMo-VL-7B rollout pass rate exceeding 90%. Additionally, we remove questions solvable even without image inputs. After data cleaning and category balancing, we curate visual reasoning dataset of 80K problems. For evaluation, we use the rule-based Math-Verify library to determine response correctness.1 Text Reasoning Since most visual reasoning data is limited to K-12 level questions, the reasoning performance of RL-trained models could be constrained. In contrast, text-only reasoning datasets include more challenging queries requiring college or competition-level intelligence. To unleash the full reasoning potential of our model, we incorporate mathematical reasoning data from Xiaomi (2025). Rewards are computed using the same rule-based Math-Verify library to ensure consistent evaluation across both visual and textual reasoning tasks. Image Grounding Accurate spatial localization is essential for models to understand object relationships and spatial reasoning in images. We include both general and GUI grounding tasks in our RLVR framework to enhance MiMo-VL-7Bs grounding capability. For bounding box predictions, rewards are calculated using the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) (Rezatofighi et al., 2019) between predicted and ground-truth boxes. For point-style outputs, rewards are determined by whether the predicted point falls within the ground-truth bounding box. Visual Counting Precise counting abilities are essential for quantitative visual understanding and mathematical reasoning in visual contexts (Chen et al., 2025a). We enhance visual counting capabilities through RL training, where rewards are defined by the accuracy of the models counting predictions compared to ground-truth counts. Temporal Video Grounding Beyond static image understanding and reasoning, we extend our RLVR framework to dynamic video content to capture temporal dependencies. We incorporate temporal video grounding tasks that require the model to localize video segments corresponding to natural language queries (Wang et al., 2025). The model outputs timestamps in [mm:ss,mm:ss] format to indicate the start and end times of the target video segments. Rewards are computed as the Intersection over Union (IoU) between predicted and ground-truth temporal segments."

Query Collection Query diversity is paramount to the success of RLHF. Our methodology commences with gathering multimodal and text-only queries from open-source instruction tuning datasets and in-house human-written sources. All collected queries, both text and multimodal, then undergo dedicated screening process. To further enhance diversity, we employ techniques such as clustering queries based on their embeddings and analyzing the resultant patterns. Crucially, we balance the proportions of Chinese and English queries, as well as those targeting helpfulness and harmlessness, before curating the final query set. For each selected query, MiMo-VL-7B and multiple other top-performing VLMs are prompted to generate responses. These responses are subsequently pairwise ranked by an advanced VLM to construct the definitive dataset for reward 1https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify 10 Figure 3 Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning in post-training phase. model training. Notably, to mitigate potential reward hacking, this same query set is utilized for both reward model training and the RLHF process. Reward Model We develop two specialized reward models tailored to different input modalities, training them using the Bradley-Terry reward modeling objective (Ouyang et al., 2022). The textonly reward model is initialized from MiMo-7B (Xiaomi, 2025) to leverage its strong language understanding capabilities, while the multimodal reward model builds upon MiMo-VL-7B to effectively process queries containing visual inputs. This dual-model approach ensures optimal performance across both textual and multimodal evaluation scenarios."

On-Policy RL Recipe We adopt fully on-policy variant of GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL algorithm, which demonstrates robust training stability and effective exploration capabilities (Chen et al., 2025b). For each problem 𝑞, the algorithm samples group of responses {𝑜1, 𝑜2, ..., 𝑜𝐺} from the policy 𝜋𝜃, and updates the policy by maximizing the following objective: JGRPO (𝜃) = E𝑞𝐷,{𝑜𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑞) , (1) 1 𝑖=1 𝑜𝑖 (cid:205)𝐺 𝐺 𝑜𝑖 𝑖= 𝑗=1 𝐴𝑖, 𝑗 where 𝐴𝑖, 𝑗 is the advantage, which is computed by the rewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, ..., 𝑟𝐺} of responses in the same group: 𝐴𝑖, 𝑗 = 𝑟𝑖 mean({𝑟𝑖}𝐺 std({𝑟𝑖}𝐺 𝑖=1) 𝑖=1) . (2) Compared to vanilla GRPO, this on-policy variant performs single-step policy updates following response rollout, eliminating the need for clipped surrogate training objective. Following Xiaomi (2025), we integrate several advancements, including removal of the KL loss, dynamic sampling, easy data filter, and re-sampling strategies, into our RL training recipe. Reward-as-a-Service The MORL process integrates tasks across reasoning, perception, grounding, multimodal RLHF, and text-only RLHF, each requiring distinct reward functions or dedicated reward models. To provide unified interface and near-zero latency reward computation, we introduce Reward-as-a-Service (RaaS). reward router dynamically selects the appropriate reward function based on the querys task type. To minimize latency, reward models are deployed as standalone services, ensuring scalable reward computation accessible via HTTP. All rewards are normalized to the range [0, 1]. No additional reward, such as format rewards, is incorporated in our training process."

During training, we observe that reasoning tasks exhibit disparities with visual perception and grounding tasks, such as visual grounding and counting, making it difficult to match the performance of standalone RL on individual tasks. The potential cause lies in the opposing growth trends of response length: reasoning tasks encourage longer CoT during the RL process, whereas grounding and counting tasks lead to shrinking ones. Disparities in task difficulty and the risk of reward hacking may also contribute to this interference. We are actively investigating the underlying causes of this phenomenon and seeking solutions to achieve consistent and persistent growth across all tasks."

MiMo-VL-7B-RL: <think>...</think> To determine the number of muffins in the image, we analyze the 34 grid (12 cells total) and count muffins row by row: - Top row (row 1): Columns 1 and 3 are muffins 2 muffins. - Middle row (row 2): Columns - Bottom 2 and 4 are muffins 2 muffins. row (row 3): Columns 1 and 3 are muffins 2 muffins. Adding these, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. There are 6 muffins in the image. Instruction: How many cats in the image? MiMo-VL-7B-RL: <think>...</think> To determine the number of cats in the image, we can observe and count: - There is black cat lying on the floor. - There is white and brown cat sitting behind the black cat. Thus, the number of cats in the image is 2. Instruction: How many dogs in the image? MiMo-VL-7B-RL: <think>...</think> To determine the number of dogs in the image, we analyze both the printed dogs on the blanket and the real dog in the foreground: 1. Printed dogs on the blanket: The blanket features grid of dog faces. Counting these, we see 3 rows with 4 dogs each, so 3 4 = 12 printed dogs. 2. Real dog in the foreground: There is 1 real dog standing in front of the blanket. Adding these together, 12 + 1 = 13. Thus, the total number of dogs in the image is 13.

Problem 7 To find 𝑥 and 𝑦, we analyze the two right triangles formed by the height: - **Right triangle (30 angle)**: Hypotenuse = 44. The height ℎ (opposite 30) is 44 sin(30) = 44 0.5 = 22. The base segment 𝑦 (adjacent to 30) is 44 cos(30) = 44 - **Right triangle (45 angle)**: This is 45-45-90 triangle, so legs are equal. The height ℎ = 22, so the other leg (left base segment) is also 22. Hypotenuse 𝑥 (45-45-90 ratio: leg 3 2 = 22 2) is 2. 3. 2. Problem 8 For square with diagonal 𝑑 = 22, the side length 𝑠 relates 2 2 = 2. Solving for 𝑠: 𝑠 = 𝑑 to the diagonal by 𝑑 = 𝑠 (rationalizing the denominator). 2 = 22 3. Problem 9 pentagon circumscribed about circle (tangential pentagon) has the property that the sum of the lengths of all sides equals 2 the sum of the tangent segments from each vertex. However, since the problem provides the side lengths 𝑄𝑍 = 10, 𝑌 𝑋 = 9, 𝑋𝑊 = 13, 𝑈𝑊 = 16, 𝑆𝑈 = 17, and the pentagon is tangential, the perimeter is the sum of these sides (as they represent the sides of the pentagon). Perimeter = 10 + 9 + 13 + 16 + 17 = 65. 4. Problem 10 𝑆𝑅 is tangent to 𝑄 at 𝑅, so 𝑄𝑅 𝑆𝑅 (tangent is perpendicular to radius). Thus, 𝑄𝑅𝑆 is right triangle with 𝑄𝑅 = 7 (radius) and 𝑄𝑆 = 25 (hypotenuse). By the Pythagorean theorem: 𝑆𝑅 = 𝑄𝑆2 𝑄𝑅2 = 625 49 = 252 72 = 576 = 24 5. Problem 11 perpendicular from the circles center to chord bisects the chord. The chord length is 16, so half the chord is 16 2 = 8. The distance from the center to the chord is 6, forming right triangle with legs 6 and 8, and hypotenuse 𝑥 (radius). By the 62 + 82 = Pythagorean theorem: 𝑥 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10 6. Problem 12 Since 𝑅, 𝑆, 𝑇 are collinear and 𝑆 is between 𝑅 and 𝑇, 𝑅𝑆 + 𝑆𝑇 = 𝑅𝑇. Substitute 𝑅𝑆 = 2𝑤 + 1, 𝑆𝑇 = 𝑤 1, and 𝑅𝑇 = 18: (2𝑤 + 1) + (𝑤 1) = 18 Simplify: 3𝑤 = 18 = 𝑤 = 6. Substitute 𝑤 = 6 into 𝑅𝑆: 𝑅𝑆 = 2(6) + 1 = 13 Final Answers 7. 𝑥 = 22 𝑤 = 6, 𝑅𝑆 = 13 2 9. 65 10. 24 11. 10 12. 2, 𝑦 = 3 8. 11 Figure 13 Example of MiMo-VL-7B-RL solving multiple geometry problems."
