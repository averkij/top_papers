Introduction Large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) can, at least in principle, respond accordingly to external references provided to them, enabling the prosperity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020) as means of addressing their inherent limitations with up-to-date or specialized knowledge. However, the performance of large language models can be greatly affected when any of the provided references are compromised (Zou et al., 2024; Greshake et al., 2023), raising reliability concerns. Partially inspired by the success of chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) in facilitating reasoning of large language models, we explore how the robustness of large lan1Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA.

Chain-of-defensive-thought uses exemplars to prompt models to generate chain of defensive thought (e.g. Reason highlighted above) before answering. guage models against reference corruption can be unlocked through structured reasoning, even for tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption with simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought. How can large language models be made more reliable when incorporating external references that could be potentially compromised and corrupted? Consider how humans would incorporate references from mixed and potentially unreliable information sources. It is generally advisable to 1 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption Figure 2. Chain-of-defensive-thought unlocks the robustness in wide range of large language models against reference corruption. Here the robustness metric is the average robust accuracy over two benchmarks where for each benchmark the minimum accuracy obtained across attack types is accounted. Please refer to section 3 for evaluation details. first examine all relevant pieces and cross-check different sources before reaching conclusion. Chain-of-defensivethought uses few exemplars (as exemplified in Figure 1) to help large language models mimic such structured reasoning process and generate chain of defensive thought before giving the final answer. Empirically, our evaluations show that chain-of-defensivethought significantly boosts the robustness of wide range of models against reference corruption on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and RealTime QA (Kasai et al., 2023) benchmarks, as summarized in Figure 2. In many cases, the improvements are astounding. For example, on Natural Questions, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks (Greshake et al., 2023), while GPT-4o with chain-of-defensive-thought prompting still maintains an accuracy of 50%. These gains are particularly remarkable given the fact that chain-of-defensive-thought is prompting only approach: prompting only approach requires no large dataset and is naturally applicable to open models as well as to black-box APIs, granting chain-of-defensive-thought the potential of becoming one of the de facto baselines for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), LLMs with web search, as well as any other applications incorporating external references. 2. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought How can language models be made more reliable when incorporating external references that could be potentially compromised and corrupted? Consider how we as humans would incorporate references from mixed and potentially unreliable information sources. Although people may have their own preferences, it is generally considered advisable to examine all relevant pieces and cross-check different sources before reaching final conclusion. Such structured reasoning plays an important role in the processing of complex and conflicting information. The key idea of chain-of-defensive-thought prompting is to guide language models to generate chain of defensive thought that mimics this reasoning process, and therefore making the eventual responses more reliable when potentially corrupted references are provided. Chain-of-defensive-thought achieves its goal through fewshow exemplars (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022), i.e. few examples in the prompt that demonstrate the task(s). Specifically, considering the following as typical template of exemplars used in standard prompting to instruct language models to incorporate external references (a.k.a. contexts): Context information is below. --------------------- <context 1> <context 2> ... 2 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption <context n> --------------------- <instruction> Query: <a query> Answer: <a response to the query> Chain-of-defensive-thought prompting includes the following modifications to standard prompting: 1. Number the references (if they are not already). 2. Include additional task instructions to firstly identify relevant and reliable contexts. 3. Before responses, insert structured reasoning steps that enunciates the indices of the relevant contexts (Irelevant) and the indices of reliable contexts (Ireliable). typical template of exemplars for chain-of-defensivethought prompting is therefore as follows: Context information is below. --------------------- context 1: <context 1> context 2: <context 2> ... context n: <context n> --------------------- First identify the relevant contexts. Then, identify the most reliable contexts among the relevant ones... + <instruction> Query: <a query> Reason: Context <Irelevant> are relevant. The most reliable contexts are <Ireliable> so will answer using only <Ireliable>. Answer: <a response to the query> Chain-of-defensive-thought offers few properties that help making it more easily applicable: As prompting only approach, it requires no large dataset, no additional training and is applicable to both open models and black-box APIs. The structured reasoning process (i.e. the chain of defensive thought) in the exemplars only depend on indices of the relevant and reliable references, which can be created with minimal additional annotations since adding irrelevant/unreliable references to exemplars is typically easy as we will do later in our experiments. At least in principle, it is compatible with any task instruction that involves incorporating external references (contexts). In the following Section 3, we will show empirically how wide range of large language models, including open models and black-box API models, exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption attacks. 3.

            "content": "In this section, we empirically evaluate chain-of-defensive prompting with 18 different language models on 2 benchmarks, Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and RealTime QA (Kasai et al., 2023), against 2 types of reference corruption attacks, prompt injection (Greshake et al., 2023) and knowledge corruption (Zou et al., 2024). We observe that chain-of-defensive-thought unlocks the robustness of wide range of large language models against empirical attacks corrupting the provided references, in many cases to an exciting degree: For example, the accuracy of GPT-4o would degrade from 60% to 3% on Natural Questions after reference corruptions, while the same model with chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50% after attacks. 3.1. Evaluation Setup Datasets. We use Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and RealTime QA (Kasai et al., 2023) as datasets in our evaluations, pairing with the corresponding external references collected by Xiang et al. (2024) (which are passages they retrieved through Google Search for each query in these two datasets). Following the evaluation settings of Xiang et al. (2024), we also use the first 100 samples from each dataset and by default provide the top 10 retrieved passages as external references for the language models. Attacks. We evaluate against two types of empirical attacks corrupting references with re-implementations from Xiang et al. (2024): Prompt injection attacks (Greshake et al., 2023), where attackers try to override actual user instructions by injecting malicious prompts to the potential references, and knowledge corruption attacks (Zou et al., 2024), also known as PoisonedRAG, where attackers create fake knowledge leading to incorrect answers to serve as the potential references. For both attacks, the last (out of total of 10) external reference provided to the language models is corrupted in our evaluations. Models. We include total of 18 different language models in our evaluations, including 6 black-box API models (Achiam et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2024) and 12 open models (Dubey et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023; Lieberum et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b; Bi et al., 2024; Groeneveld et al., 2024; Abdin et al., 2024; Young et al., 2024; Touvron et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024a). The full list of models are available alongside most of our results, such as Table 1 and 2. For black-box API models, the following specific versions were used in the evaluations: GPT-4o (2024-08-06), GPT-3.5turbo (1106), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (20241022), Claude 3.5 Haiku (20241022), Claude 3 Sonnet (20240229), Claude 3 Haiku (20240307). 3 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption Table 1.

We use the same prompt template as (Xiang et al., 2024) for standard prompting on both Natural Questions and RealTime QA, which consists of 4 exemplars. For chain-of-defensive-thought, the prompt template is obtained by applying the modifications from Section 2 to the standard prompting template, where irrelevant references are introduced by mixing the references of the first two exemplars and unreliable references are introduced by adding the fictional example we showed in Figure 1. The exact templates are shown in Appendix A. Metrics. We consider primarily two metrics: Accuracy: We use the ground truth phrases (also known as the gold answers) to assess the quality of model responses. For each query, the ground truth phrases consist of different phrases corresponding to the correct answers. The accuracy metric measures the percentage of samples for which the model responses include at least one of the ground truth phrases, i.e. accuracy = #samples s.t. (g G) response mentions #samples . In addition, we use clean accuracy to denote the accuracy of models against no reference corruption attack. We use minimum accuracy to denote the lowest accuracy of model obtained against different types of attacks. 4 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption Table 2.

The attack success rate metric measures the percentage of samples for which the model responses include at least one of the target phrases determined by the attackers, i.e. attack success rate = #samples s.t. (a A) response mentions #samples . Additionally, we use maximum attack success to denote the highest attack success rate observed on model against different types of attacks. 3.2. Eliciting Robustness against Reference Corruption We include the detailed results in Table 1 for Natural Questions evaluations and Table 2 for RealTime QA evaluations. Chain-of-defensive-thought prompting offers significant robustness gains. In Table 1, we can see that chain-ofdefensive-thought prompting improves the robustness of wide range of models against reference corruption on Natural Questions. As an example with black-box API models, chain-of-defensive-thought improves the minimum accuracy of GPT-4o under reference corruption from 3% to 50% and reduces the maximum attack success rates from 91% to 20%. For open models, chain-of-defensive-thought boosts the 5 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (a) clean accuracy on Natural Questions (b) clean accuracy on RealTime QA Figure 3. Comparing the clean performance of standard prompting v.s. chain-of-defensive-thought. In most cases, there is neither considerable increase nor decrease regarding clean performance (i.e., the performance with no external reference corrupted) of language models when using chain-of-defensive-thought to improve their robustness. minimum accuracy (under reference corruption) of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct by 35% (16%51%), while decreasing maximum attack success rates by 32% (75%43%). On average, chain-of-defensive-thought increases the minimum accuracy by 27.50 percentage points and reduces the maximum attack success rate by 29.94 percentage points on Natural Questions across all different models. Similar observations are made on RealTime QA with Table 2, with an average minimum accuracy increase of 19.89 percentage points for and an average maximum attack success rate decrease of 24.67 percentage points. These striking results demonstrate the capability of chain-of-defensivethought in making language models more reliable while incorporating external references. No considerable gain or loss regarding clean performance. In Figure 3(a) and 3(b), we compare the clean accuracy of standard prompting v.s. chain-of-defensivethought. Here we observe that in most cases, there is neither considerable increase nor considerable decrease of clean performance when chain-of-defensive-thought is introduced. On average, chain-of-defensive-thought increases the clean performance by 1.31 percentage points (with an average of 1.56 percentage points increase on Natural Questions and an average of 1.06 percentage points increase on RealTime QA), which is an order of magnitude smaller than the robustness gains from chain-of-defensive-thought and is therefore not particularly exciting in comparison. With chain-of-defensive-thought, the performance gap between using clean references and using corrupted references typically reduces for the latter models in family, suggesting that it might be more effective for models with better reasoning abilities. In Table 3, we show comparisons of the gaps within several families of language models. Here we observe that, with notable exception of the Qwen family (Yang et al., 2024a;b), the gaps between clean accuracy and minimum accuracy get smaller for more recent models Table 3.

This observation suggests that chainof-defensive-thought could be come more preferable as we obtain access to stronger language models in general, further highlighting the significance of this approach. To summarize, we just show empirically how chain-ofdefensive-thought unlocks the robustness in many models against reference corruption, without losing clean performance. Additionally, chain-of-defensive-thought is potentially more effective as models becoming more advanced. 6 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (a) accuracy () evaluated on Natural Questions (b) attack success rate () evaluated on Natural Questions (c) accuracy () evaluated on RealTime QA (d) attack success rate () evaluated on RealTime QA Figure 4. Accuracy and attack success rate for various models against prompt injection attacks (Greshake et al., 2023). 3.3. Delving into Specific Attacks So far, we primarily discuss the overall robustness of language models across different reference corruption attacks. In this part, we will delve into specific attacks for more finegrained understanding and insights. We include example chain-of-defensive-thought outputs against both attacks in Appendix B. Prompt injection attacks (Greshake et al., 2023): Prompt injection attacks include malicious instructions in the reference provided, expecting them to override the genuine user instructions. Figure 4 displays the accuracy and the attack success rate for various models with the provided references corrupted by prompt injection attacks. Firstly, we can see that chain-of-defensive-thought improves the robustness of most models against prompt injection, which is consistent with our previous observations based on overall robustness. On average, against prompt injection, chain-of-defensive-thought prompting increases the accuracy by 25.17 percentage points (with 27.94 percentage points averaged on Natural Questions and 22.39 percentage points averaged on RealTime QA) and decreases the attack success rate by 27.28 percentage points (with 28.94 percentage points averaged on Natural Questions and 25.61 percentage points averaged on RealTime QA). Another observation from Figure 4 is that, with standard prompting, prompt injection attacks are highly effective for most of the models we evaluated across both benchmarks, resulting in fairly low accuracy or fairly high attack success rate, except Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3 Sonnet, which is somewhat surprising given that the attack success rates are in comparison much higher for the other two evaluated models in the Claude family (Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku). Knowledge corruption attacks (Zou et al., 2024): Knowledge corruption attacks essentially generate fake knowledge leading towards incorrect answers as malicious references. Figure 5 displays the accuracy and the attack success rate for various models with the provided references corrupted by knowledge corruption attacks. Notably, even with standard prompting, knowledge corruption attacks are not as effective on Natural Questions as on RealTime QA, suggesting the knowledge corruption attacks might be more dependent on the tasks when compared with prompt injection attacks. That being said, many models remain vulnerable to such attacks and chain-of-defensive-thought remain effective regarding boosting their robustness. Against knowledge corruption, chain-of-defensive-thought prompting on average increases the accuracy by 12.17 percentage points (with 7.56 percentage points averaged on Natural Questions and 16.78 percentage points averaged on RealTime QA) and decreases the attack success rate by 12.47 percentage points (with 6.83 percentage points averaged on Natural Questions and 18.11 percentage points averaged on RealTime QA), which again aligns with our expectations. 7 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption (a) accuracy () evaluated on Natural Questions (b) attack success rate () evaluated on Natural Questions (c) accuracy () evaluated on RealTime QA (d) attack success rate () evaluated on RealTime QA Figure 5. Accuracy and attack success rate for various models against knowledge corruption attacks (Zou et al., 2024). 4. Related Work Chain-of-Thought prompting. Large language models have showcased impressive abilities across many tasks, but they are not as good at complex reasoning until chain-ofthought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) is introduced. Using the in-context few-shot learning ability of language models (Brown et al., 2020), chain-of-thought prompting uses exemplars with intermediate steps annotated to instruct language models to generate chain of thought when solving reasoning tasks for better performance. It has essentially become the de facto prompting choice for maximizing language model performance in reasoning tasks. Robustness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Large language models are inherently limited regarding upto-date or specialized knowledge, which motivates the need to incorporate external references. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020) addresses this need by retrieving references from external knowledge base and providing them as input to large language models. While there are many attempts to improve the overall performance of RAG systems (Asai et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), relatively few attentions are paid towards their robustness. Zou et al. (2024); Greshake et al. (2023) show that the performance of language models can be greatly degraded when some of the provided references are compromised, raising reliability concerns. Xiang et al. (2024) propose RobustRAG, which is arguably the first defense framework against reference corruption, offering provable robustness guarantees derived from aggregations. Large language models with web search. Another popular design to allow large language models incorporating external references is to augment them with web search (Luo et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024; Xiong et al., 2024), which is sometimes considered variant of RAG due to technical similarities. Similarly, language models with web search are subject to potential reference corruption attacks, especially since the information sources can be much more diverse and less controllable for web search than internal knowledge bases used in some RAG systems. 5. Conclusion In this work, we explore how large language models incorporating external references can be made more reliable. Specifically, we show how wide range of large language model exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using simple prompting-only approach called chain-of-defensive-thought, which instructs language models to generate chain of defensive thought mimicking structured reasoning process of cross-checking. Against reference corruption attacks, chain-of-defensive-thought offers an average accuracy increase of 23.70% and an average attack success rate decrease of 27.31% across our evaluations. Chain-of-defensive-thought is promising baseline for using language models to incorporate external references. 8 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption"
