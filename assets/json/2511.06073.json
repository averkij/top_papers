Introduction Language Models (LMs)1 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language generation; however, they remain fundamentally unreliable in terms of factual accuracy, often producing statements that are syntactically correct but empirically false. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as \"hallucination,\" arises from the limitations of the transformer architecture, which is optimized for generating fluent sequences of tokens based on statistical patterns rather than grounding output in verifiable knowledge (Kalai et al., 2025). In our prior study, \"How Large Language Models Are Designed to Hallucinate\" (Ackermann & Emanuilov, 2025) we argued that hallucination is not merely an artifact of insufficient training data or poor fine-tuning but rather structural feature of the transformer model itself. Specifically, transformers function as coherence engines that lack the mechanisms to regulate epistemic commitments or enforce truth constraints. Consequently, LLMs generate plausible-sounding claims without being able to distinguish between true and false information. 1 We use the terms \"language models\" (LMs) and \"large language models\" (LLMs) interchangeably throughout this work, as the distinction has become increasingly fluid across models of varying scales. Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle To address this fundamental issue, we propose the concept of Licensing Oracle, an architectural enhancement that integrates the formal verification of factual claims into the generative process. Unlike statistical learning methods, which rely on data patterns and probabilistic reasoning, the Licensing Oracle enforces epistemic boundaries through deterministic validation against structured knowledge graph and the The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) rules. This ensures that LMs can generate claims that are both logically consistent and supported by verifiable evidence, thereby eliminating hallucinations regarding structured factual knowledge. In this study, we build upon the theoretical foundation established in our earlier work and present the results of series of experiments designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle. Our experiments involved five distinct approaches to factual question-answering: baseline LM generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention, retrieval-augmented generation, and graph-based RAG that incorporates the Licensing Oracle for formal validation. The experimental results demonstrate that while statistical methods (e.g., fine-tuning and RAG) can influence factual accuracy, they cannot eliminate hallucinations in reliable or deterministic manner. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieves near-perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and effectively eliminates false answers, providing structural solution to the problem of hallucination that statistical learning alone cannot solve (see Table 5). The contribution of this work lies in demonstrating that hallucinations about structured knowledge, such as factual claims about entities and relationships that can be formally represented in knowledge graph, can be mitigated through architectural enforcement rather than through better data or larger models. By embedding formal validation into the generative process, we provide an architectural solution that scales across domains and is generalizable beyond factual question answering tasks. This study shows that the Licensing Oracle offers deterministic guarantees for factual accuracy, which purely statistical approaches fail to provide. 2. Related Work The challenge of LLM hallucination has spawned diverse research efforts in statistical learning, architectural design, and formal verification. This section situates our Licensing Oracle within this landscape, examining how prior studies have approached the hallucination problem and identifying the specific gaps that our architecture addresses. We organize our review around three key questions: (1) Can statistical methods alone solve hallucinations? (2) What architectural solutions exist, and what are their limitations? (3) How can formal validation be integrated into generative AI systems? Our analysis reveals critical pattern: while statistical approaches improve performance metrics, they cannot provide deterministic guarantees; existing architectural solutions, such as RAG ground generation, lack epistemic discipline; and formal validation techniques remain disconnected from the generative process. The Licensing Oracle bridges these gaps by architecturally enforcing truth constraints through real-time validation, moving beyond retrieval-augmented generation to constraint-governed generations."

            "title": "2.1 The Nature and Origins of Hallucination",
            "content": "The academic community remains divided on the fundamental nature of LLM hallucinations. One perspective views hallucinations as correctable artifacts of training data quality, biased corpora, and suboptimal inference procedures (Ji et al., 2023). Kalai et al., 2025 argue that LLMs are trained with evaluation incentives that \"reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty,\" suggesting that refined training objectives could mitigate this behavior. This statistical perspective implies that hallucinations represent solvable engineering challenge. In contrast, the architectural perspective, which underpins this study, posits that hallucinations are an inevitable consequence of the transformer architecture itself (Xu et al., 2024). From this perspective, LMs function as \"coherence engines\" optimized for statistical plausibility rather than factual veracity, lacking structural mechanisms to ground generated claims in verifiable evidence (Ackermann & Emanuilov, 2025). 2 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle Xu et al., 2024 formally demonstrate that hallucination is inevitable because LLMs, as computable functions, cannot provably learn all other computable functions representing ground truth (Xu et al., 2025). In our prior work (Ackermann & Emanuilov, 2025), we developed this architectural thesis through an ontological analysis of the self-attention mechanism of the transformer. We argue that transformers simulate relational structures of meaning, tokens acquiring significance through reference to other tokens, without the existential grounding in temporality, mood, and care that stabilizes human understanding. This creates what we term \"flat semantic space,\"2 where continuations are governed by statistical coherence rather than world-disclosure. We distinguished between ontological hallucinations, which arise when flat semantic space violates existential structures such as temporality or affordances, and residual reasoning hallucinations, in which models mimic inference by recycling linguistic traces of human reasoning. This theoretical foundation motivates our current work, which postulates that if hallucinations are structural rather than statistical, structural interventions are required."

            "content": "2.2.1 Fine-Tuning for Factual Grounding Supervised fine-tuning of domain-specific factual data represents the most direct statistical approach to improving model reliability. However, this method faces documented limitations, including catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; McCloskey & Cohen, 1989) and \"ripple effect failures\" where edits to one fact adversely affect unrelated knowledge (J. Wu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). Most critically, Gekhman et al., 2024 demonstrated \"fine-tuning paradox\": training LLMs on new factual knowledge can linearly increase their propensity to hallucinate, as models learn to generate confident but incorrect responses when uncertain. Our experimental results replicate this finding, with finetuning degrading accuracy from 16.7% to 8.5%, providing strong empirical support for the inadequacy of parameter optimization  (Table 2)  . 2.2.2 Training for Epistemic Abstention An alternative statistical approach trains models to abstain from answering when uncertain, commonly termed \"epistemic abstention\" (Wen et al., 2025). Methods include inferred abstention, which quantifies uncertainty through internal model states such as semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023), and supervised abstention, exemplified by R-Tuning (Zhang et al., 2024), which explicitly fine-tunes models to output \"I don't know\" for questions outside their parametric knowledge. However, these approaches achieve only probabilistic and unreliable abstention behaviors (C.-K. Wu et al., 2025). Our Gemma-Abstain model, which implements the R-Tuning methodology, achieved only 56.7% abstention precisionbarely better than random chancedemonstrating that models learn linguistic patterns rather than genuine epistemic boundaries (see Table 2). This failure of learned abstention motivates our deterministic architectural alternative."

Our baseline experiments confirm RAG's effectiveness, improving accuracy from 50.1% to 89.5% (see Table 3). However, RAG suffers from well-documented limitations including retrieval of irrelevant or contradictory information and 2 We define \"flat semantic space\" as the condition where tokens derive meaning solely through reference to other tokens, lacking grounding in world-disclosure or temporality (Ackermann & Emanuilov, 2025). 3 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle inability to synthesize conflicting sources (Gao et al., 2024; H. Wang et al., 2025; Y. Wang, Ren, et al., 2024). Most critically, standard RAG lacks mechanisms for principled abstention, gap termed \"epistemic mismatch\" by Ghafouri et al., 2025.This mismatch describes models expressing unwarranted certainty even when retrieved information is insufficient or contradictory (Sun et al., 2025). Magesh et al., 2025 demonstrated that commercial RAG systems in legal research still hallucinate in 17-33% of cases, contradicting industry claims of \"hallucination-free\" systems.

            "title": "2.4 Graph-Based Retrieval and Formal Validation",
            "content": "Recent work has explored replacing unstructured text corpora with structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for retrieval. Graph-RAG proponents argue that KGs, which store information as explicit triples (subject, predicate, object), reduce semantic ambiguity and better support multi-hop reasoning. However, comparative studies yield mixed results. (Olausson et al., 2023)found that vector-RAG and Graph-RAG have distinct, complementary strengths suited to different query types. Our results (89.5% for embeddingRAG vs. 89.1% for Graph-RAG) support the task-equivalence view for retrieval performance (see Table 3 and Table 4). However, we argue that the primary value of KGs lies not in retrieval performance but in their formal verifiability (Dehal et al., 2025; Khan et al., 2025). structured RDF graph can be deterministically validated through symbolic query languages, while high-dimensional vector spaces cannot. This verifiability is the essential prerequisite for our Licensing Oracle architecture. Parallel work in neuro-symbolic AI has demonstrated the value of decoupling probabilistic generation from deterministic reasoning (Liang et al., 2025; Qi et al., 2025). Olausson et al., 2023 introduced LINC, which uses LMs as semantic parsers to translate natural language into First-Order Logic, then executes formal theorem provers for deterministic validation. Similarly, constrained decoding methods integrate formal grammars directly into token-level generation to guarantee syntactic correctness (Geng et al., 2024; Tuccio et al., 2025). Our work extends this paradigm from syntactic to semantic constraints, using SHACL validation as mandatory licensing gate for factual claims (Ma et al., 2025; Y. Wang, Chen, et al., 2024). 2.5 SHACL and Formal Constraint Validation The Shapes Constraint Language, W3C standard for validating RDF knowledge graphs, enables formal specification of structural and logical constraints. Recent work has explored SHACL in LLM contexts, primarily using LLMs to generate SHACL constraints from natural language Westermann et al., 2025 or to interpret validation reports. Our architecture is novel in its control flow: rather than using LLMs to write SHACL, we use SHACL to govern LLM generation in real-time, implementing mandatory validation gate that ensures epistemic grounding before emission (Publio & Labra Gayo, 2025; Tian et al., 2025)."

Our contribution synthesizes these components into novel architecture that architecturally couples LLMs with formal knowledge graphs, using SHACL validation as real-time licensing oracle. Building on the theoretical foundation established in our prior work (Ackermann & Emanuilov, 2025), which identified hallucination as structural consequence of flat semantic space, this paper provides the empirical validation 4 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle and engineering implementation of solution. We move beyond \"retrieval-augmented generation\" to \"constraint-governed generation,\" achieving deterministic, provable epistemic abstention that directly addresses the epistemic reliability gaps left open by all prior approaches (see Figure 3 for capability comparison). Orthogonal to our architectural approach, alignment methods like Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022) and RLHF attempt to reduce hallucinations through training objectives that reward truthfulness. While these statistical methods show promise, they cannot provide the deterministic guarantees achieved through formal validation. Similarly, knowledge editing methods like ROME (Meng et al., 2023) enable targeted fact updates but struggle with scaling and consistency. Our Licensing Oracle is complementary to these approaches, providing architectural enforcement that could be combined with improved training objectives. 3. Theoretical Framework and Design of the Licensing Oracle At the core of our approach lies the Licensing Oracle, formal architectural component designed to govern the generative process of LMs. The Licensing Oracle operates as control layer that enforces truth constraints during text generation by validating each factual claim against structured knowledge graph and set of logical constraints encoded using SHACL. This mechanism prevents the generation of hallucinated statements by rejecting unverified or logically inconsistent claims before they are emitted by the model. The Licensing Oracle addresses the \"flat semantic space\" problem identified in our prior work (Ackermann & Emanuilov, 2025) by introducing ontological grounding through formal validation. Where transformers lack existential anchoring to world-disclosure, the Oracle enforces being-constrained-by relations to verifiable entities in knowledge graph. This architectural intervention provides the structural grounding that attention mechanisms alone cannot achieve. The Licensing Oracle intervenes directly within the models generative process. It introduces deterministic validation step that explicitly ensures that each claim made by the model is supported by verifiable evidence grounded in knowledge base that is formal, consistent, and logically constrained. This architectural addition shifts the focus from data scaling and model size to epistemic grounding. The models output is no longer governed solely by probabilistic language patterns but by structural mechanisms that demand factual accuracy and logical consistency."

            "content": "The knowledge graph is central to the Licensing Oracles operation. For this work, we employ an RDFbased graph populated with structured knowledge from sources such as DBpedia, enhanced with domainspecific ontologies and formal relationships3. The graph is designed to capture structured knowledge, such as factual claims about entities (e.g., rivers and philosophers) and their relationships (e.g., flows through, life span). The graph serves as both source of knowledge and validator. When the LLM generates factual claim, it is first extracted as triple (subject, predicate, object). This triple is then validated against the knowledge graph, which functions as licensing oracle. Using SHACL constraints4, the graph enforces domainspecific rules, such as: Type constraints: Ensuring that river flows through state, not the other way around. Logical constraints: Validating that the elevation of rivers source is greater than its mouth for gravity-fed flow. Temporal constraints: Ensuring that relationships, such as philosophical influence, are logically consistent within time constraints (e.g., lifespan overlap). 3 DBpedia SPARQL endpoint: https://dbpedia.org/sparql, Structured knowledge extracted from Wikipedia 4 W3C SHACL Specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/, Shapes Constraint Language for RDF validation 5 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle If claim passes the validation step, it is licensed for emission; otherwise, the system outputs an abstention token, preventing the generation of false or unverified statements."

            "content": "The integration of the Licensing Oracle into an LLM is achieved through middleware layer that operates alongside the models standard generation pipeline. During inference, as the model generates text in streaming mode, the following process occurs: 1. Claim Extraction: The generated text is parsed to extract potential factual claims using Named Entity Recognition (NER) model like GLiNER (Zaratiana et al., 2025)5, which identifies entities and maps verbs to predicates, creating triples (subject, predicate, object)6. 2. SHACL Validation: The extracted triples are validated against the knowledge graph using the SHACL rules, ensuring the claims are factually consistent and logically valid. 3. Licensing Decision: If the claim passes the validation, it is licensed and allowed to proceed as part of the models output. If the claim fails validation, the system outputs an abstain response, ensuring no unverified or incorrect claim is generated. 4. Provenance Reporting: For transparency and interpretability, the system logs which facts or constraints supported the decision, providing full provenance of the generated content. This makes the models reasoning process more transparent and traceable. This layered approach ensures that the models outputs are not only syntactically coherent but also epistemically grounded. The Licensing Oracle serves as an additional safeguard, ensuring that the LLM adheres to higher standard of factual reliability by enforcing structural constraints on its generation process."

            "content": "While methods like fine-tuning and RAG improve model performance by augmenting training data or providing contextual support, they do not address the fundamental epistemic gap in LLMs, namely their inability to verify the truthfulness of the claims they generate. Fine-Tuning: While fine-tuning LLMs on factual data improves recall, it often results in catastrophic forgetting or overfitting to surface patterns. Our experiments show that fine-tuned models fail to achieve reliable abstention behavior, with only 56.7% precision in abstaining from false claims, which is slightly better than random. RAG: RAG improves performance by retrieving relevant contextual information, but it remains probabilistic, it retrieves and generates based on the statistical relevance of the context, not factual correctness. As result, it still generates hallucinations when the retrieved context is inaccurate or incomplete. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle provides deterministic solution to hallucinations by validating each generated claim against formal knowledge representations. It ensures that the model only generates claims that are epistemically valid, eliminating false assertions through abstention. 4. Experimental Setup The primary objective of the experiments conducted in this work is to empirically validate the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle in mitigating hallucinations in language models. Specifically, we aim to 5 GLiNER uses bidirectional transformers for zero-shot entity recognition without task-specific fine-tuning 6 We note that our evaluation assumes perfect claim extraction. In practice, NER errors could cause false abstentions (failing to extract valid claims) or false validations (extracting incorrect triples that happen to match the graph). Measuring extraction accuracy independently is an important direction for future work. 6 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle demonstrate that the architectural coupling of LMs with formal verification system provides deterministic solution to hallucinations about structured knowledge, hallucinations that arise from the models inability to validate factual claims against verifiable knowledge. To achieve this, we compare the Licensing Oracle against several other hallucination mitigation methods, including baseline LM generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation. We also evaluate the Licensing Oracle in conjunction with graph-based RAG, which integrates retrieval with relational validation."

Fine-Tuning results. Comparative performance of Google Gemma 3-4B-Instruct across three conditions (baseline, factual fine-tuning, and abstention fine-tuning), demonstrating that parameter optimization degrades accuracy and achieves only near-random abstention precision (56.7%). Fine-tuning for factual recall led to degradation in performance compared to the baseline, with accuracy dropping to 8.5%. This suggests that fine-tuning alone cannot guarantee reliable factual grounding and may even catastrophically forget relevant facts. Fine-tuning for abstention improved performance in the sense that the model learned to output dont know in situations of uncertainty. However, this resulted in modest 56.7% abstention precision, meaning that the model still generated incorrect answers in many cases, despite being 10 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle trained to abstain (visualized in Figure 1). The abstention recall was 63.7%, indicating that the model still generated incorrect answers when abstention would have been more appropriate. These results highlight that fine-tuning, while effective at teaching model to abstain from answering when uncertain, does not adequately solve the core problem of hallucinations, as evidenced by the low precision in abstention.

Abstention Precision (green bars) measures how well systems know when to say \"I don't know\"fine-tuning achieves only 56.7% (near random chance at 50%), RAG has no abstention mechanism, while Graph-RAG achieves perfect The accuracy degradation observed in our fine-tuning experiments (16.7% 8.5%), while striking, aligns with recent findings on the limitations of fine-tuning for knowledge injection. Gekhman et al., 2024 demonstrate that fine-tuning struggles to reliably add new factual knowledge to language models, with knowledge gains often limited to surface pattern matching rather than genuine knowledge integration. This phenomenon is compounded by catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), where models lose previously learned capabilities when adapted to new tasks or datasets (Fraser et al., 2025). While larger LoRA rank parameters or alternative hyperparameter configurations might reduce this degradation, the fundamental issue remains: fine-tuning operates within the statistical learning paradigm and lacks mechanisms to enforce epistemic constraints during generation. This limitation underscores our central thesis that architectural solutions, rather than parameter optimization alone, are necessary for reliable factual grounding."

This shows the importance of retrieving relevant context to improve factual recall. We note that the 0.4 percentage point difference between embedding-based RAG (89.5%) and Graph-RAG (89.1%) falls within expected measurement variance and should not be interpreted as statistically significant performance difference. However, the RAG system lacks mechanism for abstention, meaning it continues to generate answers even when the retrieved context is insufficient or incorrect. As result, while the accuracy is high, there is still risk of hallucinations when the context is poor."

            "title": "5.7 Cross-Domain Validation",
            "content": "In order to assess the generalizability of the Licensing Oracle, we conducted cross-domain validation to evaluate its performance across different knowledge domains. The initial experiments focused on U.S. rivers, domain with well-defined, structured data. However, to test the scalability of the Licensing Oracle to other factual domains, we extended our evaluation to completely different domain: philosophers. This shift from geographical domain to an intellectual history domain presents significant challenge due to differences in entity types and the relationships between them. 5.7.1 Experimental Setup for Cross-Domain Validation For the philosophers domain, we selected 595 question-answer pairs related to intellectual influence relationships (e.g., Who influenced Immanuel Kant?). The knowledge graph for this domain was constructed by extracting structured data from literature graph that captures temporal overlaps in philosophers lifespans11, their intellectual influences, and other related properties. The Licensing Oracle was applied to this new dataset using the same methodology as for the rivers domain, where each generated claim was validated against the philosophers knowledge graph using the same SHACL validation rules. This validated the scalability of the Licensing Oracle, testing whether the system could maintain its performance across domains with very different types of entities and relationships. 5.7.2 Results of Cross-Domain Validation The Licensing Oracle achieved excellent performance across both domains, with the following results: 11 Knowledge graph constructed from structured biographical data with temporal constraints ensuring logical consistency of influence relationships 15 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle False Answer Rate on Non-Entailed Claims (FAR-NE) 0.0 0.0 Domain Questions Evaluated Accuracy (%) Abstention Precision (AP) 1,997 595 Rivers Philosophers Table 6.

Performance consistency of the Licensing Oracle across two structurally distinct knowledge domains (geographic entities and philosophical influences), demonstrating generalizability with less than 0.1 percentage point variation in accuracy and identical epistemic guarantees. 89.1% 89.0% 1.0 1. The Licensing Oracle achieved 89.1% accuracy in the rivers domain and 89.0% accuracy in the philosophers domain, with less than 2% variation between the two domains. This demonstrates the robustness and generalizability of the Licensing Oracle across different domains with structured knowledge. Abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0) were consistent across both domains, confirming that the Licensing Oracles epistemic validation is not domain-specific but rather generalizable solution for factual correctness. 5.7.3 Implications for Cross-Domain Generalization The success of the Licensing Oracle in cross-domain validation suggests that the approach is highly scalable and can be applied to variety of domains with structured knowledge. This cross-domain performance highlights the potential of the Licensing Oracle as universal tool for mitigating hallucinations in AI systems across diverse factual areas, such as medicine, law, and business intelligencedomains where accurate factual grounding is critical. By ensuring deterministic validation for any knowledge domain that can be formalized in knowledge graph, the Licensing Oracle provides flexible and scalable solution to hallucinations in LLMs, without the need for retraining or domain-specific tuning. This cross-domain validation provides further evidence that the Licensing Oracle offers necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in structured knowledge domains. 6. Discussion 6.1 Architectural Enforcement vs. Statistical Learning The results of our experiments provide compelling evidence that hallucinations in LLMs, specifically those related to factual claims about structured knowledge, cannot be fully addressed by scaling up data or finetuning alone. While statistical approaches such as fine-tuning and RAG show improvements in factual recall, they fail to address the core issue: the lack of epistemic grounding in the models generative process. Even the most advanced models, such as Claude Sonnet 4.5, continue to hallucinate facts despite being fine-tuned or augmented with relevant data. This highlights fundamental limitation of statistical learning, it cannot enforce the structural constraints necessary for ensuring factual correctness. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle provides deterministic solution to hallucination by enforcing architectural constraints. Through formal validation against structured knowledge graph and logical rules encoded in SHACL, the oracle ensures that each generated claim is both logically consistent and supported by verifiable evidence. This architectural enforcement guarantees that hallucinations, false claims generated without evidence, are eliminated entirely, feat that statistical methods alone cannot accomplish. The success of the Licensing Oracle across the rivers and philosophers domains demonstrates its generalizability. This cross-domain validation confirms that the Licensing Oracle is not domain-specific but rather provides scalable solution for hallucination mitigation in any knowledge domain where 16 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle structured facts can be represented in knowledge graph. The consistency of performance across diverse domains speaks to the architectural robustness of the oracle, making it suitable for high-value applications such as medicine, law, science, and business intelligence12, where factual reliability is paramount."

In our experiments, fine-tuned models struggled to achieve reliable abstention behavior, with abstention precision only reaching 56.7%. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0), ensuring that no false answers are generated. Furthermore, it achieves near-perfect accuracy (89.1%) in generating factually correct claims when supported by the knowledge graph.

            "title": "6.3 Limitations and Potential Improvements",
            "content": "While the Licensing Oracle demonstrates significant promise, there are several limitations that must be addressed in future work: 1. Scope of Knowledge: The Licensing Oracle can only validate claims that are explicitly represented in the knowledge graph. For domains where knowledge is incomplete or highly dynamic, the oracle may be unable to provide answers, resulting in increased abstention. Expanding the knowledge graph or incorporating dynamic knowledge base updates could mitigate this issue. 2. Subtle Semantic Distinctions: In cases where subtle semantic distinctions are required (e.g., \"has mouth\" vs. \"flows into\"), the quality of the knowledge graph plays crucial role. If the graph uses imprecise predicates or lacks certain relationships, the oracle may fail to validate claims accurately. Future improvements could involve refining the ontology and expanding its coverage to better capture nuanced relationships. 3. Ambiguous and Temporal Queries: The Oracle currently lacks mechanisms for disambiguating underspecified questions (e.g., \"Which Colorado?\") or handling time-dependent facts that change over time. These boundary cases represent important directions for architectural extensions. 4. Multi-Hop Reasoning: The current implementation of the Licensing Oracle validates individual triples but does not yet handle multi-hop reasoning. Complex inferences that require connecting multiple facts across the knowledge graph may not be validated correctly by the current system. Developing Graph-Constrained Reasoning techniques could extend the oracles capabilities to handle more complex, multi-hop queries. 5. Coverage vs. Precision Trade-Off: The Licensing Oracle prioritizes precision, ensuring that only valid claims are emitted, at the expense of coverage. For domains with incomplete knowledge graphs, this trade-off may result in higher rate of abstentions. Balancing coverage and precision is an ongoing challenge that may require combining the Licensing Oracle with other systems, such as statistical retrieval or knowledge graph expansion."

            "content": "The findings of this paper suggest paradigm shift in how we approach the problem of hallucinations in LLMs. Rather than relying on data scaling or model size to improve performance, we propose that 12 Domains requiring provable correctness guarantees where statistical confidence intervals are insufficient for liability or safety-critical decisions 17 Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, are the key to achieving reliable AI systems. This is particularly true in high-value applications where factual accuracy is critical, such as medicine, law, science, and business intelligence. The Licensing Oracle introduces the idea of epistemic governance, where the generative process is constrained not just by probabilistic reasoning but by formal, logical validation. This paradigm is similar to type systems in programming, where code is validated against predefined rules before it can be executed. Similarly, the Licensing Oracle serves as gatekeeper for language generation, ensuring that only valid claims are emitted. This architectural coupling between language models and formal knowledge representations could pave the way for more reliable, truth-constrained AI systems in the future. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we introduced the Licensing Oracle as an architectural solution to the problem of hallucination in language models. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Licensing Oracle provides deterministic solution to hallucinations about structured knowledge, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are generated. Unlike statistical approaches, which rely on probabilistic patterns and fail to achieve reliable factual grounding, the Licensing Oracle enforces formal validation through structured knowledge graph and SHACL constraints, providing perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and eliminating licensed hallucinations (FAR-NE = 0.0), meaning no false claims were generated for questions where the system provided answers, though false abstentions represent precision-coverage trade-off (as shown in Table 5). We also demonstrated that the Licensing Oracle is necessary and sufficient for mitigating hallucinations in domains with verifiable knowledge representations. While it is not applicable to creative content, openended conversations, or subjective judgment, the Licensing Oracle provides critical tool for improving AI reliability in high-value applications. The success of the Licensing Oracle shows that the path to reliable AI does not lie in scaling data or models but in architectural innovation that embeds truth-validation directly into the generative process. Future work will focus on expanding the oracles capabilities, improving multi-hop reasoning, and exploring hybrid systems that combine statistical generation with architectural validation."

The system operates through five stages: (1) graph retrieval, (2) LLM generation, (3) claim extraction, (4) validation, and (5) abstention decision.

Retrieve relevant subgraph (multi-hop traversal) subgraph = retrieve_subgraph(question, knowledge_graph, max_hops=3) # 2. Generate LLM response with graph context llm_response = llm_generate(question, subgraph) # 3. Extract factual claims as triples claims = extract_claims(llm_response) # GLiNER NER # 4. Validate each claim (THE ORACLE) FOR claim IN claims: IF NOT triple_in_graph(claim, knowledge_graph): RETURN \"I don't know\" # No evidence IF violates_constraints(claim, constraints): RETURN \"I don't know\" # Logical violation # 5.

Knowledge Graph Structured facts as RDF triples: <River_Colorado> :length \"2334000.0\" . <River_Colorado> :sourceElevation \"2743.0\" . <River_Colorado> :traverses <State_Colorado> . 2. SHACL Constraints The system implements seven distinct SHACL constraints to validate factual claims: Constraint 1: Tributary Type Validation Ensures that objects of the hasTributary property are instances of River class. This type constraint prevents logical inconsistencies where non-river entities are incorrectly identified as tributaries. Target: Subjects of :hasTributary predicate Validation: Checks that ?tributary has rdf:type :River Violation: Reports instances where tributary is not typed as River Constraint 2: Source Elevation Positivity Validates that river source elevations are positive values, as elevations below sea level (0 meters) are physically implausible for river sources in the dataset domain. Target: All instances of :River class Validation: Checks that :sourceElevation > 0 Violation: Reports rivers with source elevation 0 Constraint 3: Length Positivity Ensures that river lengths are positive values, preventing invalid measurements or data entry errors. Target: All instances of :River class Validation: Checks that :length > Violation: Reports rivers with length 0 Constraint 4: Discharge Positivity Validates that discharge rates (water flow volume) are positive, as negative discharge values are physically meaningless. Target: All instances of :River class Validation: Checks that :discharge > 0 Violation: Reports rivers with discharge Constraint 5: Mouth Elevation Constraint Ensures mouth elevations are within physically reasonable bounds. While mouths at sea level (0m) are common, extreme negative values (< -100m) indicate data errors. Target: All instances of :River class Validation: Checks that :mouthElevation -100 Violation: Reports rivers with mouth elevation < -100 meters Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using Licensing Oracle Constraint 6: River Flow Downhill (Physical Law) Enforces the fundamental physical law of gravity: rivers flow from higher to lower elevations. The source elevation must exceed the mouth elevation. Target: All instances of :River class Validation: Checks that :sourceElevation > :mouthElevation Violation: Reports rivers where source mouth elevation Constraint 7: Geographic Consistency Validates geographic coherence by ensuring that rivers traversing U.S. states are located in the United States. This constraint catches inconsistencies in geographic relationships. Target: Subjects of :traverses predicate Validation: If river traverses State, checks for :inCountry dbr:United_States Violation: Reports rivers traversing U.S. states but not in U.S. country 3.
