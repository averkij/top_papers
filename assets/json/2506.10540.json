            "content": "The emergence of large-scale multimodal models [Kong et al. 2024; Li et al. 2025; Liu et al. 2024c; Yang et al. 2024] has ignited significant interest in storytelling videos. In response, new wave of methods [Dalal et al. 2025; Guo et al. 2025; Kim et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2024] including MINT Video and TTT-Video has emerged, aiming to generate the entire video in single pass. However, these methods still face significant challenges when generating long videos spanning multiple scenes and characters, particularly in maintaining visual continuity, narrative coherence, and non-repetitive content. In contrast, recent advancements in single-clip video generation, exemplified by models like Wan [Wan et al. 2025], Vidu[Bao et al. 2024], and Pika [Pika Labs 2025], have pushed generated video clips closer to cinematic quality. Due to shorter clip duration, these models utilize textual and visual prompts directly and efficiently, improving motion quality, semantic fidelity, and consistency with reference images. Consequently, utilizing these models to generate storytelling video with multiple clips appears highly promising. Existing storytelling video frameworks [He et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Lin et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2025; Xie et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2025], which implement the composition of multiple video clips, generally follow fixed pipeline: script scene images video clips final video composition. While this modular format can effectively generate multi-shot long videos, it also introduces several limitations: Firstly, existing methods typically map scene images to fixed-length clips. It forms rigid and fragmented video construction, leading to disjointed transitions and unnatural pacing, severely hindering the expressive continuity crucial for complex or extended actions. Secondly, due to the inherent instability of video generation models, single flawed clip can noticeably degrade the overall video quality. To mitigate fragmentation, an intuitive approach is generating continuous clips conditioned on prior frames, but this compounds error propagation and quality degradation. Drawing parallels with professional filmmaking, we identify that existing methods overlook Best-of-N Samplinggenerating multiple clip candidates and selecting the best ones. However, implementing this faces two challenges: prohibitive computational costs and inadequate automated evaluation mechanisms. Generating and evaluating multiple candidate clips per shot is computationally intensive, often relying on expensive commercial APIs or prolonged GPU inference. Current evaluation metrics like VBench [Xing et al. 2024] only assess individual clips and their internal consistency, neglecting critical elements such as cross-clip coherence, sequential motion quality, and animation-specific qualities in storytelling animation. To address these challenges, we introduce AniMaker, multiagent framework with MCTS-driven clip generation. This multiagent framework mirrors professional production, including the Director Agent for storyboards, Photography Agent for clip generation, Reviewer Agent for evaluating the quality of clip candidates, and Post-Production Agent for editing the entire videos. These agents collaborate to enable automated multi-character, multiscene storytelling without manual preor post-processing. The core Photography and Reviewer agents interact with each other under an MCTS-Gen scheme during clip generation. Specifically, based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), MCTS-Gen offers an efficient Haoyuan Shi, Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, et al strategy for navigating the vast candidate space of video generation. It strikes balance between broad exploration and computational efficiency by intelligently allocating more generation opportunities to promising clips while encouraging the exploration of unexplored regions. For Reviewer Agent, we introduce comprehensive evaluation framework AniEval, specifically designed for multi-shot storytelling animation. AniEval advances beyond metrics like VBench by implementing retrospective evaluation with cross-clip contextual references. It evaluates critical dimensionsstory consistency, action completion, and animation-specific attributesby analyzing each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. This contextual assessment serves as the quality evaluation mechanism for video-clip nodes within the MCTS-Gen framework. We conduct extensive experiments on the dataset constructed from TinyStories [Eldan and Li 2023], featuring complex interaction with multiple characters across diverse backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate AniMakers superior performance across VBench, AniEval, and human evaluation, with significantly improved multi-candidate generation efficiency. This validates AniMakers effectiveness in bringing AI-generated storytelling videos closer to production-grade quality (as shown in Figure 1). In summary, our main contributions are in three key aspects: We propose AniMaker, fully automated multi-agent framework for generating coherent, multi-character, multi-scene animation from textual stories. The framework features MCTS-Gen, novel search-based generation strategy that efficiently balances exploration and resource usage. We develop AniEval, the first comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for multi-shot storytelling animation. It provides context-aware assessment by analyzing clips in relation to their surrounding content. Experimental results demonstrate AniMakers superior performance across all evaluation frameworksachieving best scores across all scene image metrics, ranking 1st in VBench, 14.6% higher scores in our AniEval, and better human ratings (3.22 versus 2.07)."

            "content": "Storyboard Visualization. Storyboard visualization bridges script to video by generating coherent image sequences, demanding flexible, reusable character-background modules for multiple scenes. While adapter-based techniques like IP-Adapter [Ye et al. 2023], Mixof-Show [Gu et al. 2023], T2I-Adapter [Mou et al. 2024], ROICtrl [Gu et al. 2024], and StoryAdapter [Mao et al. 2024] realize character consistency, they often overlook background continuity. Consistencyaware methods try to address this challenge. StoryGen [Liu et al. 2024b] iteratively generates images using previous visual-language context, while StoryDiffusion [Zhou et al. 2024] employs trainingfree Consistent Self-Attention module to improve feature alignment. Despite these advancements, the precise preservation of visual details, especially with multiple characters or changing backgrounds, remains challenge. Video Generation. Driven by the success of diffusion models, VDM [Ho et al. 2022] pioneers their application to video generation, leading to improved models like Stable Video Diffusion [Blattmann et al. 2 AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation Fig. 2.

Photography Agent generates candidate video clips using MCTS-Gen, which optimizes exploration-exploitation balance. Reviewer Agent evaluates clips with our AniEval assessment system.

This multi-agent system enables fully automated, high-quality animated storytelling. 2023], ModelScope [Wang et al. 2023], VideoCrafter1 [Chen et al. 2023], and VideoCrafter2 [Chen et al. 2024]. While these models excel at animating single text or image, they struggle with maintaining consistency across multiple video clips. Following Sora[Liu et al. 2024c], research has been increasingly focusing on coherent storytelling videos, with several works[Dalal et al. 2025; Guo et al. 2025; Kim et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2024] enhancing temporal modeling and contextual understanding. Despite these advancements, challenges persist as single-pass long video generation often suffers from inconsistencies and repetitive content over time. Considering this, models like HunyuanVideo [Kong et al. 2024], Wan [Wan et al. 2025], and CogVideoX [Yang et al. 2024] still prioritize the effective utilization of text prompts and reference images, resulting in more faithful generation and improved motion depiction. Industry solutions [Bao et al. 2024; Pika Labs 2025; Pixverse AI 2025; Runway AI, Inc. 2025] extend these advancements, enabling features like start/end frame-specific control. Storytelling Video Agent. Storytelling video generation typically follows pipeline: script scene images video clips final video composition. Large multimodal models (LMMs) often act as high-level planners, coordinating each stage. Models such as VideoDirectorGPT [Lin et al. 2023], DreamStory [He et al. 2024], AnimDirector [Li et al. 2024], MM-StoryAgent [Xu et al. 2025], MovieAgent [Wu et al. 2025], and DreamFactory [Xie et al. 2024] adhere to this conventional pipeline. Notably, certain tasks like scriptwriting, character design, voiceovers, and sound effects are typically handled manually during preor post-processing."

            "title": "3.3 Multi-Agent Framework: AniMaker",
            "content": "3.3.1 Director Agent. The Director Agent orchestrates storyboard generation through two-stage process. First, Gemini 2.0 Flash [Google Cloud 2025] creates raw script with shot descriptions (shot𝑘 ), followed by automated validation for consistency and narrative flow. Second, in the Storyboard (Sboard) realization phase, Visual Bank is built: Character Bank is built (Bchar) with Hunyuan3D [Zhao et al. 2025] and Background Bank (Bbg) is built with FLUX1-dev [Flux AI 2025]. Then, GPT-4o [Hurst et al. 2024] generates keyframes (Fkey ) combining validated shot descriptions (d𝑘 ) with Visual Bank imagery. This ensures visual consistency, with the resulting Sboard serving as the animation production blueprint in the following phases. 3.3.2 Photography Agent. Converting storyboards to clips in multi-shot AI video generation presents challenges including distorted appearances, inconsistent motion, and object inconsistencies. Inspired by filmmakings \"NG\" concept and \"gacha\" methods prevalent in AIGC, we recognize the necessity of generating multiple candidate clips to select the optimal one. For optimal selection, each 𝑘 4 Haoyuan Shi, Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, et al clip must not only possess high individual quality but also ensure consistency and coherence with both preceding and succeeding clips. However, naively generating 𝑘 candidates per clip creates combinatorial explosion (e.g., 𝑘2 for two-clip sequences). Notably, poor-quality current clips allow for pruning the search space, as further exploration down such paths is unlikely to be satisfactory. Thus we propose MCTS-Gen, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)- inspired method for multi-clip video generation (Figure 3). MCTS naturally fits this task: multi-clip sequences correspond to tree paths, with each clip as node. Crucially, clip evaluation considers both intrinsic quality and inter-clip consistency, aligning with MCTSs backpropagation where childs scores update the parents evaluation results. MCTS-Gen iteratively constructs chosen path of selected video clips, extending this path by one clip per iteration. This process is controlled by the following parameters: w1 (initial candidate count per node), w2 (UCT-guided expansion times per iteration), and 𝜶 (exploration-exploitation balancing factor, default 1). Specifically, we use Wan 2.1 [Wan et al. 2025] for video clip generation, and the algorithm proceeds as follows: 1. Expansion: w1 (3 in Figure 3) initial child clips are generated from the chosen paths terminal node (node 1 in Figure 3). These clips (node 3, 4, 5 in Figure 3) are then scored using AniEval (detailed in Section 3.3.3) and ranked. 2. Simulation: Further w2 (3 in Figure 3) expansions are generated guided by the UCT score: 𝑼 𝑪𝑻 (𝒏𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒋) = 2.0 𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒌 (𝒏𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒋) + 1 + 𝜶 2.0 𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒍𝒅_𝒄𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 (𝒏𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒋) + 1 where 𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒌 is from the initial AniEval scoring, 𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒍𝒅_𝒄𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 is dynamically updated, and 𝜶 balances exploitation and exploration. The node with the highest UCT score generates new child clip. 3. Backpropagation: AniEval scores of child clips (nodes 6, 7, 8 in Figure 3) propagate upwards. parent nodes score is updated by adding the average score of children to its own. 4. Selection: The node with the highest AniEval score (node 3 in Figure 3) is added to the chosen path, then generating new child clips until reaching total of w1 children, allowing the iterative generation process to continue. This MCTS-Gen process systematically balances the exploration of diverse video generation space with the exploitation of promising paths, aiming to efficiently construct high-quality, coherent video sequence while managing computational resources. 3.3.3 Reviewer Agent. Existing objective metrics, such as CLIP Score and Inception Score, may identify superior video generation models, but often struggle to differentiate among candidates from the same model using the same prompt. Similarly, the widely adopted VBench has significant limitations. For instance, some of its metrics, like \"dynamic degree,\" are overly simplistic, merely measuring pixel changes rather than accurately reflecting character action. More critically, VBenchs \"Consistency\" metrics, based on single-clip segmentation, prove unsuitable for multi-shot animation, which inherently involves frequent character and scene changes. To address evaluation challenges, we introduce AniEval, comprehensive evaluation framework built on EvalCrafter [Liu et al. 2024a]. AniEval refines EvalCrafters metrics for fully automated AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation Fig. 3. Illustration of our MCTS-Gen strategy for efficient Best-of-N Sampling. evaluation, e.g., by automating action assessment through comparing prompted character actions with those identified in video clips. Furthermore, responding to the specific demands of evaluating multi-shot animation characterized by multiple characters and diverse scenes, AniEval introduces several additional metrics: DreamSim [Fu et al. 2023] assesses overall frame consistency; CountScore [Cheng et al. 2024] aims at the issue of objects appearing or disappearing between shots; Face Consistency evaluates animated character facial consistency by training an InceptionNext [Yu et al. 2024] model on the Anime Face Dataset [splcher 2019], overcoming the limitations of conventional face recognition methods like MTCNN [Ku and Dong 2020] in anime face detection and tracking. In conclusion, AniEval comprises 4 primary domains with 14 fine-grained metrics for comprehensive assessment  (Table 1)  . Additionally, AniEval supports contextual scoring by evaluating clips based on preceding and succeeding content, providing robust evaluation for multi-shot animation generation. 3.3.4 Post-production Agent. The Post-production Agent transforms video clip sequences into polished animation film through three stages. Firstly, it leverages Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate detailed voiceover script specifying narration, dialogue, emotional tones, and desired voice timbres. The agent then selects appropriate voice profiles based on character attributes (age, gender) and assesses text length for audio-visual synchronization. Secondly, the script is processed through CosyVoice2 [Du et al. 2024] to generate Table 1. AniEval Metrics.

Finally, the agent employs the MoviePy library for film assembly, integrating validated subtitles and performing comprehensive editing to ensure precise synchronization between visuals, voiceover, and subtitles. 5 Table 2.

These narratives feature complex multi-character interactions across diverse backgrounds, providing an ideal testbed for multi-shot animation generation. 4.1.2 Baseline. We evaluate several state-of-the-art storytelling models: StoryGen, StoryDiffusion, and StoryAdapter (visual narrative specialists), alongside MovieAgent, MMStoryAgent, and VideoGenof-Thought (video generators). The latter group utilizes their built-in video modules, while StoryDiffusion and StoryAdapter are paired with external image-to-video models (CogVideoX and Wan 2.1). 4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. For scene image generation, we evaluate text-to-image alignment and cross-image consistency. Metrics include Text-to-Image CLIP (Coherence) [Radford et al. 2021], Imageto-Image Similarity (I-I Sim) [Gal et al. 2022], and Text-Image Similarity (T-I Sim) [Hessel et al. 2021]. Video generation is assessed using VBench and our AniEval for comprehensive evaluation. 4.2 Qualitative Analysis Based on samples in Figures 5 and 6, we qualitatively analyze AniMakers output, focusing on visual fidelity and narrative coherence in multi-character, multi-scene animated storytellings. Enhanced Consistency. AniMaker achieves superior visual consistency across scenes. While baselines struggle with character and background consistency during transitions, AniMaker maintains visual characteristics even when switching between different scenes. This stems from the Director Agents storyboard creation, providing consistent reference images for characters and backgrounds. Additionally, AniEval ensures coherent clip selection by evaluating cross-clip consistency metrics. Improved Action Representation. AniMaker excels at depicting complex and extended character actions. Baseline methods often produce incomplete movements, particularly for multi-step action sequences (e.g., squatting, picking up an object, standing up, and walking away in Figure 5). Our MCTS-Gen strategy enables the Photography Agent to explore and select clip sequences that concatenate into coherent, complete long actions. Seamless Transitions Between Clips. AniMaker delivers smoother video transitions through effective generation and selection mechanisms. The Reviewer Agent uses AniEval, integrating cross-clip consistency metrics like DreamSim and applying contextual scoring across adjacent clips, minimizing visual disruptions.

Table 2 demonstrates that AniMaker outperforms all competing methods across metrics. Notably, AniMaker achieves Text-to-Image Similarity (T-I Sim) score of 0.31, representing 19.2% improvement over the best-performing baseline. This advantage stems from our multimodal storyboard generation approach that incorporates character references, background references, and text prompts for keyframe generation, rather than relying solely on text. VBench Evaluation Analysis. Table 3 shows that AniMaker achieves the best average rank (2.50), demonstrating consistent top-tier performance across metrics. While MMStoryAgent excels in Semantic Consistency (S.C.) and Background Consistency (B.C.), its 0.00 score in Dynamic Degree (D.D.) reveals critical limitationit produces static image sequences resembling comic strips rather than true animation. This exposes VBenchs limitations: it favors static consistency (where even brief static images can achieve high scores) and focuses on individual clips rather than multi-scene, multi-character animation. These findings highlight the need for new evaluation framework specifically designed for storytelling animation quality. AniEval Evaluation Analysis. We introduce AniEval for better evaluation of storytelling Animation. Table 4 presents results from our AniEval framework. AniMaker outperforms all competitors with total score of 76.72, representing 14.6% improvement over the second-best model (VideoGen-of-Thought at 66.93). Particularly noteworthy is AniMakers exceptional performance in Video Consistency (V.C.), surpassing the best-performing baseline by 15.5%. AniMakers relatively lower performance in Text-Video Alignment (T.V.A.) can be attributed to our agent frameworks creative adaptation of stories into scripts, where additional narrative elements are introduced. Compared to VBench, AniEvals assessment results align remarkably better with human evaluations  (Table 5)  , confirming that AniEval provides more comprehensive and accurate assessment of multi-shot animation quality than previous metrics.

This change results in 7.1% reduction in performance (the green triangle in Figure 4) on AniEval, confirming the importance of our MCTS-driven generation strategy. Notably, even this ablated version still outperforms the best-performing baseline method by 6.6%, further demonstrating that our multi-agent framework remains highly competitive even without clip candidate selection. Next, we ablate AniEval by generating five candidates per clip with VBench for selection. This yields score of 73.18, 4.6% decrease compared to our full method. Qualitative assessment of the resulting videos also reveals noticeable degradation in action expressiveness and cross-clip consistency, highlighting the importance of AniEval for storytelling animation."

            "content": "Despite employing state-of-the-art models for storyboard and video clip generation, gap remains between current model capabilities and commercial film production quality. Key limitations include poor adherence to physical laws and unrealistic interactions between scene elements, creating bottlenecks in production-ready output. However, our framework adopts modular, plug-and-play architecture that enables seamless model integration. As more advanced models emerge, we will continuously update our framework and share these workflow improvements with the community, especially mitigating the hallucination of models [Wang et al. 2024]."

            "title": "6 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "We present AniMaker, comprehensive multi-agent framework that transforms text input into coherent storytelling animation by emulating professional workflows. Our system introduces two key innovations: MCTS-Gen, which optimizes exploration-exploitation balance during clip generation, and AniEval, the first evaluation framework specifically designed for multi-shot storytelling animation. AniMaker orchestrates specialized agents that seamlessly collaborate across storyboarding, generation, evaluation, and postproduction stages. Our quantitative results validate the effectiveness of this approach, with substantial gains in both technical metrics and perceived quality. These advances mark an important step toward bridging the gap between AI-generated content and professional animation standards, paving the way for more accessible and highquality animated storytelling production. Fig. 4. AniEval Score of Different w1 (initial candidate count) and w2 (expansion iterations) Combinations. MCTS-Gen Parameter Analysis. Figure 4 shows how MCTS-Gen parameters w1 (initial candidate count) and w2 (expansion iterations) affect generation quality. Two patterns emerge: higher w1 values improve AniEval scores by providing more initial candidates, while higher w2 values enhance performance by better evaluating each clips suitability for continuous generation. Importantly, once certain thresholds are reached, configurations with fewer total generations (e.g., w1 = 3, w2 = 3 with 4.37 generations per node) perform comparably to those requiring more (e.g., w1 = 3, w2 = 5 with 5.76 generations per node). This demonstrates MCTS-Gens efficiencycompressing the search space by over 50% compared to exhaustive search strategies (which require 9 generations per node for the same candidates) while maintaining quality.

            "content": "Following MovieAgents evaluation framework [Wu et al. 2025], we conduct human evaluation with 10 participants on 90 storytelling videos from 9 models across 10 stories. Each video was rated on 1-5 scale across five dimensions: Visual Appeal, Script Faithfulness, Narrative Coherence, Character Consistency, and Physical Law Adherence. Note that evaluating complete storytelling videos (rather than individual clips) typically yields lower scores due to the increased complexity and length. As shown in Table 5, our model achieves superior performance across all metrics, with particularly strong results in Character Consistency."

This figure illustrates the visualization of the short story of Tom and Lily. In the story, Tom brings sack of toys to the town square, where he meets sad girl named Lily who has no toys. Tom offers to share his toys, and the two children happily play together. Three modelsStoryDiffusion, StoryAdapter, and AniMaker (ours)are compared. AniMaker demonstrates superior narrative consistency, emotional expression, and character continuity across frames. It coherently depicts the extended action sequence of Tom picking up the sack, leaving his house, and arriving at the square. In contrast, while StoryDiffusion and StoryAdapter capture key moments from the story, they suffer from inconsistencies in visual coherence and character alignment, with mismatched character appearances highlighted by red boxes in the figure. 9 Haoyuan Shi, Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, et al Fig. 6. comparative case showcasing AniMaker and models capable of generating storytelling videos. This figure visualizes the story of Sue, little girl who tries to climb big tree in the park but gets scared. Her friend Tom warns her to be careful, and she climbs down safely. Grateful, Sue hugs Tom, and they play on the swings together. The comparison includes MovieAgent, MMStoryAgent, VideoGen-of-Thought, and AniMaker (ours). AniMaker stands out with coherent scene progression, expressive character interactions, and consistent character identities. It clearly captures Sues emotional journey and key eventsfrom climbing the tree and feeling afraid, to receiving help and having fundemonstrating strong temporal and narrative alignment. In contrast, MovieAgent shows limited relevance to the input story, with inconsistent visuals and abstract content. VideoGen-of-Thought and MMStoryAgent follow the narrative more closely but still suffer from visual continuity issues, with character mismatches highlighted in red boxes."
