            "content": "With the upsurge in adoption of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) based systems for document processing, the quality of document ingestion pipelines has become increasingly critical. * Equal Contributions Figure 1: Overview of the core domains and subdomains in KITAB-Bench. Our benchmark spans nine major domains (e.g., OCR, charts to JSON, table recognition) and 36 sub-domains (e.g., scanned text, handwritten text, various chart types), providing comprehensive evaluation framework for modern Arabic document processing and analysis. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays crucial role in this pipeline, enabling the conversion of physical documents into machine-readable text and databases for enabling effective knowledge retrieval. Although significant progress has been made in the multilingual OCR (JaidedAI, 2020; Fu et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024; Smith, 2007), with comprehensive datasets like PubLayNet (Zhong et al., 2019b), DocBank (Li et al., 2020), M6Doc (Cheng et al., 2023), and DocLayNet (Pfitzmann et al., 2022), Arabic OCR continues to lag behind. This gap is largely due to the unique challenges of the Arabic script, including its cursive nature, complex typography, and right-to-left text orientation.  (Table 1)  , Existing Arabic OCR datasets like KHATT (Mahmoud et al., 2014) and IFN/ENIT (Pechwitz et al., 2002) focus mainly on handwritten text, whereas APTI (Slimane et al., Figure 2: Overview of different tasks in our benchmark: Eight key components illustrating the task inputs and outputs for table recognition, chart understanding, text recognition, diagram analysis, VQA, line detection, layout analysis, and PDF-to-Markdown conversion, complete with input/output examples for each task.

Benchmarks compared: LaraBench (Abdelali et al., 2023), CamelBench (Ghaboura et al., 2024), MIDAD (Bhatia et al., 2024), KHATT (Mahmoud et al., 2014), and KITAB-Bench (Ours). (: Only the Arabic samples are considered.) (: The test set of the dataset is considered.) 2009) covers only specific aspects of printed text. These efforts fail to address advanced document processing challenges such as table parsing, font detection, and numeral recognition. Arabic benchmarks like CAMEL-Bench (Ghaboura et al., 2024) and LAraBench (Abdelali et al., 2023) evaluate large multimodal and language models, but they give limited attention to document understanding tasks. Consequently, there remains need for more comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate and compare Arabic OCR solutions. Our benchmark addresses these gaps by offering diverse document types and evaluation tasks to facilitate in-depth assessments of modern OCR systems. We present KITAB-Bench, comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark spanning 9 domains and 36 sub-domains. Our framework evaluates layout detection (text blocks, tables, figures), multi-format recognition (printed/handwritten text, charts, diagrams), and structured output generation (HTML tables, DataFrame charts, markdown). This enables rigorous assessment of both basic OCR capabilities and advanced document understanding tasks. The contributions of this work include (1) comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark covering multiple document types and recognition tasks. (2) Detailed evaluation metrics for assessing performance across different document understanding challenges. We also propose CharTeX and CODM metric to evaluate chart extraction and diagram extraction respectively. (3) Baseline results for popular OCR systems and Vision Language Models (VLMs), highlighting current limitations and areas for improvement. (4) standardized framework for comparing Arabic OCR systems, facilitating future research and development."

Recent efforts like MIDAD (Bhatia et al., 2024) curates extensive training data for Arabic OCR and handwriting recognition, while Peacock (Alwajih et al., 2024) introduces culturally-aware Arabic multimodal models. Existing resources such as CAMEL-Bench (Ghaboura et al., 2024), LAraBench (Abdelali et al., 2023), MADAR (Bouamor et al., 2018), OSACT (Mubarak et al., 2022), and Tashkeela (Zerrouki and Balla, 2017) focus on language modeling or specific tasks rather than full-page OCR evaluation. Handwriting datasets including HistoryAr (Pantke et al., 2014), IFN/ENIT (Pechwitz et al., 2002), KHATT (Mahmoud et al., 2014), APTI (Slimane et al., 2009), and Muharaf (Saeed et al., 2024) emphasize word/line recognition over document structure analysis. Arabic table recognition faces challenges from merged cells and RTL formatting (Pantke et al., 2014). While methods like GTE (Zheng et al., 2021), GFTE (Li et al., 2021), CascadeTabNet (Prasad et al., 2020), TableNet (Paliwal et al., 2019), and TableFormer (Nassar et al., 2022) advance Latin table detection, their effectiveness on Arabic documents remains unproven. Document conversion pipelines (CCS (Staar et al., 2018), Tesseract (Smith, 2007), Docling (Auer et al., 2024), Surya (Paruchuri, 2024b), Marker (Paruchuri, 2024a), MinerU (Wang et al., 2024a), PaddleOCR (Du et al., 2020)) lack Arabic-specific optimizations for segmentation and diacritic handling (Mahmoud et al., 2018; Kiessling et al., 2019). This highlights the critical need for comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmarks addressing text recognition, table detection, and layout parsing."

In Phase (Topic Generation), our system employs an LLM to generate diverse topic names across multiple domains. This phase incorporates various personas (academic, legal, medical, technical) to ensure broad coverage of document types. Phase II (Data Generation) transforms the validated topics into structured raw data. The LLM generates content following Arabic linguistic and formatting conventions across various domains. In Phase III (Code Generation), the system converts the validated raw data into plotting code, with special attention to Arabic text rendering requirements and RTL content management. Phase IV (Image Rendering) utilizes specialized rendering engines (Mermaid, Plotly, Vegalite, HTML) to create visual representations while maintaining Arabic text integrity. The final phase (Human Evaluation) implements rigorous quality control through expert validation. Evaluators filter charts, tables and diagrams based on detected anomalies and ensure adherence to Arabic-specific document conventions. This phase is crucial for maintaining the high quality of our benchmark dataset. Our benchmark dataset comprises over 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, representing comprehensive collection of Arabic document types for OCR evaluation. As detailed in Table 8, the dataset combines carefully curated samples from established datasets, manually annotation PDFs, and synthetically generated content created through our LLM-assisted pipeline (Figure 4). The Image-to-Text portion (3,760 samples) includes data from historical documents (HistoryAr (Pantke et al., 2014)), handwritten text collections (Khatt (Mahmoud et al., 2014), ADAB (Boubaker et al., 2021), Muharaf (Saeed et al., 2024)), and scene text (EvAREST (Hassan et al., 2021)), while layout detection comprises 2,100 samples from BCE-Arabic-v1 (Saad et al., 2016) and DocLayNet (Pfitzmann et al., 2022). For layout analysis, we incorporated 1,700 samples from BCE-Arabic-v1 dataset (Saad et al., 2016), 400 samples from DocLayNet dataset (Pfitzmann et al., 2022) focusing on financial, academic, legal, and patent documents. The line detection and recognition tasks contains 378 samples each from self-developed dataset.

Figure 2 illustrates the nine distinct tasks in our evaluation framework. We evaluate three categories of systems: VLMs, traditional OCR systems, and specialized document processing tools. For VLMs, we include both closed-source models like gpt-4o-2024-08-06, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 (Hurst et al., 2024; Achiam et al., 2023), and gemini-2.0-flash (Georgiev et al., 2024; Google DeepMind, as well as open-source alternatives 2025), such as Qwen2-VL-7B (Wang et al., 2024b), Qwen2.5-VL-7B (Team, 2025), and the AIN-7B (Heakl et al., 2025). Traditional OCR approaches in our evaluation include Surya (Paruchuri, 2024b), Tesseract (Smith, 2007), EasyOCR (JaidedAI, 2020), and PaddleOCR (Li et al., 2022; Du et al., 2021). For specialized document processing tasks, we employ systems like Docling (Auer et al., 2024), and Marker (Paruchuri, 2024a).

Table Recognition: We evaluate table extraction using both HTML and CSV formats, where HTML format (evaluated using TEDS (Zhong et al., 2020)) preserves rich structural information including cell spans and hierarchical relationships crucial for complex Arabic tables, while CSV format (evaluated using Jaccard Index 2) focuses on raw data extraction optimized for machine processing and data analysis pipelines. This dual-format evaluation ensures systems can both maintain complex table structures for human readability and provide clean, structured data for automated processing, specifically important for RAG based systems. J(P, G) = G G = G + P (2) where G represents the number of exact matching cells between predicted and ground truth tables, and G represents the total number of unique cells across both tables. Chart-to-Dataframe: This task evaluates extracting structured data from Arabic charts into machine-readable dataframes. Systems must accurately parse numerical values, text labels, and preserve data relationships across chart types (bar, line, pie). We use the Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM) (Xia et al., 2024)which combines type recognition, topic understanding, and structural numerical fidelity (see Appendix D)and also propose our own CharTeX (Chart Extraction Score) metric. CharTeX combines the chrF scores for chart type and topic with the jaccord index for the dataframe, using fuzzy matching (80% threshold) when columns do not exactly align. Metric = αJtype +βJtopic +(1αβ)Jdata (3) Here, Jtype and Jtopic denote the chrF scores between the predicted and ground-truth chart type and topic, while Jdata measures the structural similarity of the predicted and ground-truth JSON data. Diagram-to-JSON: This task evaluates the conversion of Arabic flowcharts and technical diagrams into JSON while preserving semantic relationships and technical specifications. We propose CODM (Code-Oriented Diagram Metric), extending SCRM (Xia et al., 2024), with the same fomulation as in Eq 3. More detail about this metric is provided in Appendix E. Image-to-Text: This task assess the basic text recognition capabilities across different Arabic fonts and styles, including the handling of cursive script connections, diacritical marks, and various text orientations. We use we use Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER). For predicted text sequence ˆy and ground truth sequence y, CER is computed as: CER = L(y,ˆy) , where L(y, ˆy) is the Levenshtein distance between character sequences and is the ground truth length. WER is calculated the same way with words as the unit of error. Visual Question Answering: Tests the ability of models to understand and reason about Arabic document content, we evaluate using standard accuracy for MCQ questions and exact word match. Line Detection: Focuses on the accurate identification and processing of individual text lines in Arabic documents. We evaluate using mean Average Precision (mAP) at different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds: mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, which assess the localization accuracy of detected text lines. Layout Detection: Assesses document structure analysis capabilities, including the identification of headers, paragraphs, and complex layout elements in Arabic documents. Performance is measured using mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 for localization accuracy, complemented by Precision, Recall, and F1 scores to evaluate the overall detection quality across different layout components. All metrics are computed on our diverse benchmark dataset, which encompasses various document types and complexity levels in both Arabic and multilingual contexts.

            "content": "Our evaluation of document structure understanding reveals distinct performance patterns across layout detection and line processing tasks. In layout detection  (Table 4)  , RT-DETR (Zhao et al., 2023) achieves superior overall performance with mAP@0.5 scores of 0.750 and 0.758 on BCE (arabic only) and DocLayNet (english) datset respectively. However, Surya (Paruchuri, 2024b) demonstrates higher precision (0.782 on DocLayNet, 0.751 on BCE), despite lower recall rates. This trade-off suggests that different architectures optimize for different aspects of layout detection. The line processing results  (Table 3)  highlight clear contrast between detection and recognition capabilities. While Surya excels in detection with mAP@0.50 of 79.67%, EasyOCR demonstrates superior recognition performance (WER: 0.53, CER: Group Model Chart Diagram Visual QA SCRM CharTeX CODM MTVQAO ChartsVQAM DiagramsVQAM PATDVQAM Average Closed Open GPT-4o GPT-4o-mini Gemini-2.0-Flash Qwen2-VL-7B Qwen2.5-VL-7B AIN-7B 68.6 67.2 71. 56.6 36.2 66.6 45.95 43.33 56.28 21.59 22.08 34.61 61.6 61.4 71.8 63.0 59.2 66.40 32.00 26.80 35. 19.60 23.00 31.50 77.00 58.00 72.00 59.00 74.00 75.00 85.29 83.33 88.24 82.35 79.41 85.29 82.50 80.00 75. 77.50 74.50 87.00 69.19 62.03 67.68 59.61 62.72 69.69 Table 7: Model Performance on Chart Understanding, Diagram Parsing, and Visual Question Answering Tasks.

This inverse relationship between detection and recognition performance across models indicates fundamental challenge in optimizing both capabilities simultaneously. Notably, Tesseract shows consistent but lower performance across both metrics, suggesting that newer architectures have made significant improvements over traditional approaches. We also observe that no single model excels at both detection and recognition, which requires for hybrid solutions."

            "content": "Across table extraction tasks  (Table 5)  , closedsource models maintain clear advantage, with GPT-4o achieving 85.76% TEDS and 66.36% Jaccard scores. Among open-source models, AIN (75.94% TEDS) significantly outperforms Qwen variants, while specialized frameworks like Surya achieve competitive results (70.42% Jaccard) through targeted pipelines. In OCR evaluation  (Table 6)  , Gemini-2.0-Flash leads with the lowest error rates (CER: 0.13, WER: 0.32). Notably, AIN matches this performance level (WER: 0.28), while traditional OCR frameworks like EasyOCR and Tesseract show moderate performance (CER: 0.58, 0.54). The significant performance drop in Paddle (CER: 0.79) and Surya (CER: 4.95) highlights the challenges in developing robust OCR systems. End-to-end document processing  (Table 5)  reveals the largest gaps between approaches. Closedsource models maintain consistent performance (GPT-4o: 65.12% MARS, Gemini-2.0: 65.65% MARS), while open-source models show substantial degradation (Qwen2-VL-7B: 21.42% MARS). Framework approaches achieve better stability, with Tesseract and EasyOCR scoring above 50% MARS, suggesting that specialized pipelines can partially bridge the gap with larger models in complete document processing tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that while closed-source models maintain superior performance over open-source models across most tasks, specialized frameworks like Surya, RTDETR Layout, and EasyOCR achieve competitive performance in targeted scenarios like table extraction, layout detection, and text recognition respectively. However, this framework advantage significantly diminishes in end-to-end pdf-to-markdown tasks where the integration capabilities of large models prove crucial, as evidenced by the performance gaps between commercial VLMs and traditional systems like EasyOCR, Surya and Tesseract in End-to-End PDF task  (Table 5)  ."

Our dataset of 8,809 samples across nine major domains is the most diverse collection assembled for OCR evaluation, incorporating handwritten, scanned, synthetic, and scene text, as well as complex tables, charts, and end-to-end pdf-tomarkdown. This framework extends beyond simple text recognition to include structural document analysis and enables systematic assessment of OCR performance across various fonts, styles, and layouts."

            "content": "Despite its contributions, this benchmark has limitations. While it covers diverse Arabic document types, it lacks full representation of historical manuscripts and low-resource dialects. Future work should expand to include these, along with scanned records from government, academic, and financial institutions. Another key limitation is in table and chart recognition, where OCR models struggle with structure preservation, header detection, and merged cell parsing. Though our benchmark introduces challenges in these areas, further refinements are needed for robust multimodal OCR capable of jointly processing text, tables, and figures. Future advancements should focus on dataset expansion, novel evaluation metrics, deep learning refinements, and cross-lingual OCR innovations to enhance Arabic VLMs."
