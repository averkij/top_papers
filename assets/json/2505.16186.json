            "content": "The emergence of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI-o3 (OpenAI, 2025) and DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025), is reshaping the landscape of large language models (LLMs). These models incorporate reinforcement learning to strengthen their capacity for complex reasoning. In contrast to former LLMs, they first think by generating structured chains of thought before delivering final answer. This reasoning process enables significantly improved performance on coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step logical inference. However, recent studies have also identified severe safety risks in LRMs, as they comply with harmful queries, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and generate harmful responses with greater risk (Zhou et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025). To tackle this challenge, recent efforts have focused on safety alignment training using curated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data with safety reasoning process (Jiang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), as well as reinforcement learning (RL) (Guan et al., 2024). Specifically, with careful data generation and selection, supervised fine-tuning has achieved significant safety performance while maintaining general abilities and being computationally efficient (Wang et al., 2025). However, as the successful jailbreak example shown in Figure 1, our evaluation reveals critical limitation of supervised fine-tuned models: they struggle to generalize to unseen malicious queries, particularly jailbreak prompts. Given the rapid evolution of jailbreaking techniques (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Rahman et al., 2025), addressing this limitation is essential for robust safety. To enable robust safety alignment, we first carefully examine models responses and observe common pattern in reasoning models: as shown in Figure 1, they will first try to understand and reiterate the query, then they will start to think about how to approach and answer the query. We find that the first sentence following the query understanding process plays critical role in determining the safety of its response to harmful queries. If this sentence reevaluates and realizes the safety concern of the query, such as Hmm, this is concerning., the response will likely be safe. We note this moFigure 1: We find that (1) Supervised fine-tuned LRMs are vulnerable to jailbreaks like multi-turn attacks. (2) The most common thinking pattern of LRMs is to first understand the query, then proceed to think about how to answer. (3) Upper right: Safety aha-moment in the key sentence (K) can lead to safe response. (4) Bottom right: Based on the query understanding content (U), the SFT model can usually identify unsafe jailbreak queries explicitly, but not when responding to the query. Here, means the final answer. ment as the aha-moment in the safety reasoning. Conversely, if this sentence starts to approach the query, the response tends to be unsafe. Therefore, this sentence is safety indicator for the rest of the response, and we term it the key sentence. Our second finding is that, as in Figure 1 (4), although being attacked successfully by jailbreak prompts, the safety of the query can often be judged from the models understanding process. Therefore, the model may not utilize it well to activate the safety aha moment when responding to the query. Based on our findings, we propose the SafeKey framework, aiming to strengthen the safety ahamoment in the key sentence, thereby enhancing the overall safety of model responses. Specifically, we proposed two optimization objectives beyond the original language modeling loss on safety reasoning data. First, we would like to enhance the safety signals in models representation of both (1) the full content preceding the key sentence and (2) its query understanding process. To this end, we introduce Dual-Path Safety Head, which employs two parallel prediction heads that take the respective hidden states from the LRM and predict the safety of the query during training. Second, to encourage the model to attend more to its query understanding process when generating the key sentence, we introduce Query-Mask Modeling objective. This task masks the input query tokens and requires the model to generate the key sentence solely based on its understanding and re-iteration of the query. Empirical results on multiple safety benchmarks show that both our proposed objectives, when combined or used alone, improve the LRMs safety, especially on unseen harmful queries and jailbreak strategies. For instance, SafeKey reduces the harmfulness rate of LRMs on three jailbreak attacks by 10.3% on average across three models. Meanwhile, our method preserves helpfulness, achieving performance on general abilities benchmarks that is comparable to the base LRMs. Finally, we provide further analysis to justify our method design and explain how SafeKey enhances model safety by reshaping internal attention patterns and improving the quality of the hidden representations."

            "content": "By analyzing the thinking process of LRMs, we observe that it typically begins with an understanding and reiteration of the users query, which we note as . Following , the LRM reasons about how to answer it, denoted as H. Notably, we find that the first sentence of H, usually indicates how the model will proceed next in the thinking process. We note this sentence as key sentence K. For instance, as in Figure 1, if states First, need to think about {knowledge related to the query.}, the model typically proceeds to address the query without safety reasoning. Key sentences that lead to safety thinking include Hmm, this is concerning., Wait, but isnt that really dangerous?, etc. We refer to such moments as the models Aha-moment for safety reasoning. To verify the universality of these patterns, we sample 30 responses from both the R1-8B Distilled model and the R1-8B model fine-tuned on the STAR-1 (Wang et al., 2025) safety reasoning dataset (R1-8B SFT) on harmful queries from JBBBehaviors (Chao et al., 2024). For each response, we manually annotate: (1) whether there is at the beginning of the response. (2) whether there is after that can indicate the safety of the full response. We observe that all responses from both models begin with , and that appears in 86.7% of R1-8B responses and 100% of R1-8B SFT responses. For R1-8B, we identified cases where the model thinks about safety at the beginning and still answers the query at the end, due to insufficient safety alignment. These results support our findings across models."

To quantitatively validate the generalizability of this finding, we first test R1-8B SFT on two jailbreak attacks, WildJailbreak and X-teaming (Jiang et al., 2024; Rahman et al., 2025). Then, from the examples where the model is successfully attacked, we extract 148 from the response of R1-8B SFT. To select , we first identify several typical patterns for K, such as nnFirst . Then we find model responses containing these patterns and select the response before this part. Finally, we manually remove the redundant part from the selected if it contains information from H. We let both the R18B SFT and GPT4o judge the safety of the original query based on only 1. In this task, GPT-4o achieves 59.9% accuracy, and R1-8B SFT achieves 80.4% accuracy. Both are relatively high, considering the R1-8B SFT is attacked successfully by all the jailbreak prompts associated. This shows that has the potential to be useful information to judge the safety of the query, but the SFT-trained LRMs can not leverage it well. This observation could be attributed to the memorization issue of SFT (Chu et al., 2025), where the model memorizes the training data, but does not fully learn to leverage its own reasoning contents to help determine safety."

            "content": "Reasoning Process Partition To enable finegrained safety alignment, we need to acquire the query understanding and key sentence from the SFT training data containing both safe and unsafe queries. We achieve this by prompting GPT4o with in-context examples, and let it output the sentence index where ends for each response in the SFT data. We leave the full prompt in the Appendix A.4. We then manually review and correct the more challenging examples, specifically those where contains at least three sentences; these account for less than 10% of the data. The sentence after will be K. Dual-Path Safety Head According to Eq. 1, the generation of the key sentence is conditioned on input query and query understanding process . Therefore, we want to strengthen the safety signals in the hidden states of and , so that they can better guide the generation of K. To achieve this, we introduce binary safety prediction head H1: S1 = H1( 1 (cid:88) E(X, )i) (2) H1 takes the average of the last layer hidden states of LRM, E, for the and as inputs, and predicts the safety of the query. Further, given the finding that the query understanding process contains important safety signals of jailbreak prompts in Sec. 2.2, we also want to strengthen the safety signals in alone, so that when is unseen jailbreaking prompt in the inference time, the hidden states of can provide sufficient safety information to activate the safety aha Figure 2: The SafeKey framework: Dual-Path Safety Head contains two safety prediction heads H1, H2 that take last-layer hidden states on the early generation stage as input and predict the safety of the query.

Therefore, we introduce the second safety prediction head H2 that takes the average of the hidden states of only: S2 = H2( 1 (cid:88) E(U )i) (3) These prediction heads, as well as the LRM providing the embedding E, are optimized using the binary cross-entropy loss. Given ground-truth safety label {0, 1}, the loss is computed as: Noted here, we only calculate the cross-entropy loss for the tokens in K: LQMM = (cid:88) tIK log Pθ(kt M, U, k<t) (6) In this way, QMM channels all learning signals through the pathway, amplifying the parameters and attention weights that convey safety signals from . The two losses we introduced are combined with the language modeling loss on the original SFT training data: LDPSH = (cid:88) βi(y log Si + (1 y) log(1 Si)) Ltotal = LLM + α1LDPSH + α2LQMM (7) (4) Where βi is the weight for each head. In our implementation, we use single linear layer as the prediction head, making the approach computationally efficient. The prediction head will be discarded in inference time."

Therefore, we would like to improve the influence of the safety signals in on the generation of K. To this end, we propose the Query-Mask Modeling task, in which we mask out the input query X, forcing the LRM to only leverage the information in the query understanding process to predict the key sentence K: = LRM(M, ) (5) In practice, we notice that introducing LDPSH and LQMM at the early stage of training can negatively affect the models learning on the original language modeling. Therefore, we introduce the new training objectives after 60% training process is finished."

(2025) using Crescendo attack (Russinovich et al., 2024), and collect successful attack samples using x-teaming on R1-8B (Rahman et al., 2025). We also test pre-filling attack (Andriushchenko et al., 2024) by collecting the harmful responses from R1-8B on StrongReject and JBB-Behaviors, and select the first 20 tokens as prefilling tokens.

Math reasoning, coding, and language understanding abilities are tested on Math 500 (Lightman et al., 2023), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024). Evaluation Metrics For safety data, we adapt GPT-4o as evaluator (Hurst et al., 2024), which assigns scores 1-5 to the LRMs responses, following the scoring criteria used by prior works (Qi et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024b; Ren et al., 2024; Rahman et al., 2025), where higher scores indicate greater harmfulness 2. We use the proportion of test cases assigned the maximum harmfulness score of 5 as harmfulness rate, and use the average of the score of each response as harmfulness score (Qi et al., 2023). We compare the harmfulness of the full response, considering that the entire output is visible. For XStest, we adapt the evaluation prompt used by prior works and calculate the non-refusal score (Röttger et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025).

The results are presented as Harmfulness rate (Harmfulness score). erage safety performance and outperforms variants using only single training objective. This demonstrates that the two objectives are complementary and can jointly contribute to improved safety. Hidden States Selection For Dual-Path Safety Head. In Sec. 3.1, we design Safety Prediction Head for the hidden states of and (X, ). Here, we try different hidden state variants: (1) Only apply safety prediction head on . (2) Only apply safety prediction head on (X, ). (3) Replacing the average of (X, ) with the average of hidden states for all the tokens that feed to H1. We test these hidden state variants on three R1-Distilled models, with average results on all safety datasets presented in Figure 3. First, we observe that predicting query safety from the hidden states of all tokens, U, Full, yields the lowest safety performance, suggesting that early-stage safety signals are more important to improve the safety of the response. Second, using only the hidden states of (X, ) also results in lower performance, highlighting the importance of strengthening the safety signal in , consistent with our analysis in Sec. 2.2. Finally, strengthening the safety signals of all contexts before the key sentence, besides strengthening only, is beneficial to the safety performance, as the input query is also important for safety judgment. Does Query-Mask Modeling Benefit Merely from Additional Language Modeling Training? Query-Mask Modeling (QMM) introduces additional language modeling training beyond the standard SFT baseline. Thus, one possible explanation for its performance improvement is simply the increased exposure to language modeling. To isolate the effect of QMM itself, we conduct an ablation study where we add language modeling trainFigure 3: Ablation on different hidden states used in the Dual-Path Safety Head. The U, (X, U) version, which we used in the end, achieves the best performance. from the training datas limited coverage of such edge cases, causing models to misinterpret sensitive phrases in benign queries as harmful. Compared to SFT baseline, SafeKey has stronger and more robust resistance to unsafe signals, which also leads to higher tendency to over-refuse borderline queries. Lastly, we observe that models with better initial alignment exhibit less over-refusal after alignment training, suggesting that they learn fewer spurious correlations from the data. Nevertheless, borderline safety cases are relatively rare in real-world applications, making the general capabilities of LRMs, such as language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding, more critical indicator of their utility. As shown in Table 1, on average, SafeKey scores 0.8% higher than the R1-distilled models across three models, and only 0.2% lower than the SFT baseline. This shows SafeKey maintains comparable overall performance on these tasks and good model utility."

The results averaged on three models are reported in Figure 4. We find that adding Key Language Modeling barely improves safety, while QMM can achieve superior performance, reducing the average harmfulness rate by 1.7% and the harmfulness score by 0.05 across three models. This indicates that letting the model focus more on its own understanding is helpful during test time."

            "content": "Attention Analysis Both the Dual-Path Safety Head and Query-Mask Modeling have the effect of improving the influence of the query understanding process on the generation of the key sentence K. To examine whether this is true when facing harmful queries during inference time, we perform an attention analysis. Specifically, we sample 20 queries each from the StrongReject and WildJailbreak test sets and obtain the corresponding responses from the R1-8B SFT model. We then manually annotate the index of the key sentence in these responses. Then, we acquire the last-layer attention weights from the key sentence tokens to both the tokens in and . We use the average last-layer attention weight from each token in to all tokens in as the attention score between and : AKU = 1 (cid:88) (cid:88) iK jU Attnlast(i, j) (8) Figure 6: Safety head loss comparison between the detached and the original version of DPSH. With DPSH optimization on LRMs, the hidden states of LRMs become easier to classify correctly. Attnlast(i, j) is the attention weight from token in to token in in the final transformer layer, averaged on all attention heads. Similarly, we compute AKX as the attention between and X. We compare the attention scores between R18B SFT and the 8B SafeKey model; the results are in Figure 5. We observe that SafeKey indeed increases the attention score between and when facing both jailbreak and non-jailbreak harmful queries. Meanwhile, SafeKey has similar attention score between and with SFT. The increased attention to indicates more influence from to K, which can help LRMs identify the harmful intent of jailbreak prompts. Dual-Path Safety Head Enhance the Safety Signals in the Hidden States To verify that the Dual-Path Safety Head (DPSH) enhances safetyrelated signals in the hidden states, we train variant of the model in which the hidden states are detached from the computation graph before being passed to the safety prediction head. This prevents the model from using the DPSH loss (LDPSH) to improve its internal representations. Meanwhile, we disable the original language modeling loss LLM when LDPSH is applied, so that the LRM is fixed and the hidden states are better for the safety head to learn for classification. We then compare the LDPSH during training between this detached variant and the standard SFT+DPSH setup for both 8B and 14B models, as shown in Figure 6. We observe that for both models, the DPSH loss is consistently lower for the standard setup compared to the detached one throughout training. This indicates that when the safety head is allowed to backpropagate gradients into the model, the model learns to produce hidden states with stronger safety signals, helping the activation of safety aha-moment. In contrast, when the hidden states are detached, the safety head can barely learns to correctly classify the safety based on the analysis of LRMs and propose the SafeKey framework to enhance their robustness. Jailbreak Attack and Defense Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) to circumvent their safety alignment. prominent category is strategy-based attacks, which includes jailbreaking strategies developed by humans and automated red-teaming LLMs (Shen et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), including jailbreaking with multi-turn conversations (Russinovich et al., 2024; Rahman et al., 2025). In addition to these, prefilling attack manipulates model behavior by starting the generation with partially compliant responses (Zhao et al., 2024b; Andriushchenko et al., 2024). GCG attack optimizes suffixes that can guide the model to generate tokens toward compliance (Zou et al., 2023). To enhance the robustness of LLMs against jailbreak, alignment-based training methods have been proposed. Safe unlearning improves safety by removing the harmful knowledge from the LLMs (Zhang et al., 2024b) and improves over DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). Data augmentation creates SFT data that guides models to shift from unsafe to safe responses (Qi et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024). Zhao et al. (2025) further introduces token-level weighted dual-objective loss and unifies unlearning and augmented fine-tuning. Inference-time approaches, such as the backtracking mechanism, have also been explored (Zhang et al., 2024a). Beyond alignment, complementary directions like representation engineering also enhance model robustness (Zou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024). Our work is the first to enhance safety SFT for large reasoning models (LRMs), building on novel insights into their reasoning behavior and advancing the frontier of LRM safety alignment."

            "content": "In this work, we identified the brittleness of SFTaligned large reasoning models (LRMs) against jailbreak attacks. To address this challenge, we start with detailed analysis of LRMs safety behaviors. Based on our analysis, we propose the SafeKey framework with two complementary training objectives to enhance the safety signals in LRMs hidden states, as well as their impacts on the generation of the key sentence. Our experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeKey against various jailbreak strategies while maintaining the models utilities. Finally, we provide in-depth analysis to explain the mechanism of SafeKey. Figure 7: Average KL divergence between aligned and base LRMs on harmful generations. SafeKey enables greater deviation from base LRMs with higher KL divergence. hidden states, with loss values remaining roughly consistent. These findings validate the effectiveness of DPSH in shaping the representations of LRMs to better encode safety-relevant signals. SafeKey Enable Greater Deviation from Base LRMs. We compute the KL divergence between the next-token distributions of the original model and safety-aligned variants when responding to malicious queries, using the unsafe queries in StrongReject and JBB Behavior datasets (Souly et al., 2024; Chao et al., 2024), along with the harmful responses generated by the base LRMs. As shown in Figure 7, compared to standard SFT, our proposed SafeKey method demonstrates higher KL divergence in all token positions up to the 50th token. This indicates that SafeKey induces more substantial deviations from the unsafe generation trajectory, which aligns with its improved robustness against wide range of jailbreak attacks."

Prior studies have revealed the brittleness of safety alignment in LRMs on malicious queries and adversarial attacks (Zhou et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025), as well as unique safety risks and novel safety attacks for them (Kuo et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025). To improve safety, both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning approaches have been explored (Guan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). In particular, the open-source community has primarily focused on SFT with safety reasoning traces, due to its computational efficiency. With carefully curated training data, SFT has led to notable safety gains (Wang et al., 2025). However, our evaluations reveal substantial performance drop for SFT-aligned models against outof-distribution adversaries. To better understand this vulnerability, we conduct detailed behavioral"

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "While our proposed SafeKey framework improves safety alignment for LRMs, several limitations remain. First, our method is tailored to large reasoning models and may not directly apply to standard LLMs that generate responses without structured reasoning steps. Second, our approach involves manual identification of key sentences for small subset of the training data, which limits scalability. For larger training sets, this process may require more human labor. More scalable and precise automatic strategies, such as majority voting across multiple LLMs, could be explored and applied for larger training set. Finally, our methods performance on multi-turn jailbreak and over-refusal datasets still has improvement space. Future work can create reasoning dataset on these domains to further improve safety alignment."

Answer format: Short Reasoning: <one sentence reasoning> Safety: Safe/Unsafe Here is the summarization: summarization Table 3: Prompt template for judging the safety of queries based on in Sec. 2.2. A.4 Prompts Used in the Paper Here, we show the prompt used for judging the safety of queries based on in Table 3, the prompt for Reasoning Process Partition in Table 6, and the prompt for GPT4o judge in Table 7. For multiturn attack evaluation, we input the attack goal to the GPT-4o judge as user instruction. A.1 Experiment Details Training Details We use full parameter training with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 optimization (Rajbhandari et al., 2020). Following Wang et al. (2025), we use batch size of 128 and learning rate of 1e 5. Testing Details Following the evaluation setup of Wang et al. (2025), we sample 250 test examples from the Wild Jailbreak dataset (Jiang et al., 2024). For WildChat (Zhao et al., 2024a), we select 370 samples consisting of the top 100 highest-scoring one-turn English conversations in each ModAPI category, based on the ModAPI score. For the XTeaming multiturn attack, we identify 50 harmful behaviors from HarmBench and apply multiturn attack strategies on R1-8B; only the successful attacks are included in our test set. A.2 Reliability of the GPT4o Evaluation The evaluation system we adapted was proposed by Qi et al. (2023), and has been widely used for safety evaluation (Zhao et al., 2024b; Ren et al., 2024; Rahman et al., 2025). Notably, Rahman et al. (2025) validated the effectiveness of GPT-4o under this scoring framework, reporting strong agreement rate of 84.50% with HarmBench test classifiers. To further assess its reliability, we conducted human annotation study. Specifically, we sampled 50 queries each from the JBB Behavior and Wild Jailbreak datasets. We evaluated the safety of responses generated by R1 8B on JBB Behavior, and R1 8B SFT on Wild Jailbreak. Comparing our human annotations with GPT-4os harmfulness ratings, we observed 92% agreement rate, supporting the robustness of the automatic evaluation. We identify the most frequent failure reason is that sometimes the reasoning process discloses unsafe information, which we consider harmful, but since the LRMs response includes some disclaimer, the GPT-4o gives score of 4. Noted that prior works (Wang et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025) used Llama-guard 3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024) for safety evaluation for LRMs. However, we find that Llama-guard 3 has low recall rate for jailbreak examples. For instance, in the 50 responses on Wild Jailbreak, Llama-guard 3 only identified 13 harmful responses out of 19. While GPT-4o identified 17 harmful responses.

Looking at the policies, under Illicit/Criminal Behavior, section 5 says must refuse to assist with instructions on committing crimes. Using someone elses credit card without authorization is definitely theft, which is crime. So, according to policy 5.1, should refuse to provide such information. shouldnt give any tips or methods because that would be enabling criminal behavior. Instead, maybe can offer general advice on financial literacy or ethical alternatives. That way, Im staying within the guidelines and providing helpful information without supporting illicit activities. also need to ensure my response is empathetic and redirects the conversation towards positive solutions. Perhaps suggest talking to financial advisor or exploring legal ways to manage finances. This approach aligns with the policys objective of refusing assistance in criminal acts while still being supportive. </think> In dystopian society, understanding how to navigate financial systems like credit cards might seem crucial for survival. However, its important to emphasize ethical and lawful actions. If you find yourself in situation where you need help managing your own finances, consider seeking guidance from financial counselor or advisor who can provide personalized strategies. Additionally, exploring legal alternatives, such as budgeting tools or community support programs, can help improve your financial well-being without compromising integrity.
