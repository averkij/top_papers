Recent advances in large multimodal models suggest that explicit reasoning mechanisms play critical role in improving model reliability, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment. While such reasoning-centric approaches have been proven effective in language and vision tasks, their extension to 3D remains underdeveloped. CoRe3D introduces unified 3D understanding and generation reasoning framework that jointly operates over semantic and spatial abstractions, enabling high-level intent inferred from language to directly guide low-level 3D content formation. Central to this design is spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, allowing the model to reason over geometry in compositional and procedural manner. By tightly coupling semantic chain-of-thought inference with structured spatial reasoning, CoRe3D produces 3D outputs that exhibit strong local consistency and faithful alignment with linguistic descriptions. 1. Introduction Despite rapid progress in 3D generation, most existing methods remain imitation-based, reproducing shapes rather than reasoning about objects [52, 105]. As result, they struggle with prompts that implicitly describe relations, counts, geometry, or physical contacts, concepts that recent unified languagevision models have begun to handle effectively in 2D settings [69, 98]. This progress is largely attributed to the integration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning [81], which, when extended to multimodal LLMs [7, 50, 109, 112], improves interpretability and consistency across visual reasoning tasks [34, 48]. However, unified reasoning in the 3D domain remains under-explored; few models are capable of jointly interpreting and constructing 3D objects [80, 104]. To advance this frontier, we propose CoRe3D, framework for collaborative reasoning that unifies semantic understanding and geometric generation within single 3D-LLM. As illustrated in Fig. 1, CoRe3D integrates unified 3D language model with an octant-based 3D VQ-VAE, enabling the model to reason in both language and 3D token space. At its core, our approach couples Semantic CoT for high-level textual planning with novel Geometric CoT for spatial synthesis. The geometric CoT operates autoregressively across octant blocks, addressing the limitations of existing flat voxel representations that waste computation on empty space and fail to capture structured spatial dependencies. Unlike part-level representations [9], which require fixed ontologies and suffer from poor generalization across categories, or voxel-level representations [53, 90], which remain unstructured and semantically agnostic, our octant-based representation remains ontology-free yet structure-aware. To jointly refine both reasoning streams, we further employ Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [60], allowing CoRe3D to learn from multi-critic feedback that balances semantic intent, visual quality, and physical coherence. This reasoning-aware framework produces high-fidelity 3D construction with enhanced spatial understandlanguage ing while maintaining strong general abilities. This approach is essential for three reasons: (1) it elicits plans where no gold\" supervision exists; (2) it allows for granular process credit assignment using dense 3D-specific rewards; and (3) it prevents reward hacking and overfitting by leveraging an ensemble of different critics. By rewarding both linguistic reasoning and 3D synthesis, our approach lays the groundwork for general 3D intelligence, unifying understanding and generation. Preprint. Work in progress. Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 1: We introduce CoRe3D, framework that unifies Semantic CoT and octant-based Geometric CoT through collaborative reasoning. By coupling language-grounded reasoning with shape constructions, CoRe3D enables bidirectional capability in both 3D understanding and generation, allowing the model to interpret objects and construct them within unified framework. Contributions: In summary, our contributions are: We introduce CoRe3D, collaborative reasoning framework that unifies two complementary reasoning levels, Semantic CoT for textual planning, with novel octant-based Geometric CoT that acts as structure-aware yet ontology-free prior, enabling interpretable progressive construction without category-specific part definitions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use Co-GRPO to jointly optimize semantic and geometric reasoning in 3D. This approach elicits plans without direct supervision and effectively assigns credit using dense 3D-specific rewards (e.g., symmetry, physical coherence) for improved alignment, structure, and robustness. We further demonstrate that our unified reasoning paradigm is not limited to generation but naturally extends to reciprocal 3D understanding tasks, such as 3D-to-text captioning, highlighting its potential as scalable foundation for general 3D intelligence. 2. Related Work 3D Generation. Early text-to-3D frameworks [10, 18, 35, 37, 52, 55, 64, 66, 72, 79, 105] formulated 3D synthesis as an optimization problem guided by 2D priors through score distillation sampling (SDS). While this approach enabled cross-modal 3D generation without paired data, it required long per-instance optimization and often produced viewinconsistent geometry. Subsequent methods [8, 54, 62, 73, 78, 103] address view inconsistency by enforcing cross-view semantic constraints within diffusion pipelines. Other works address the inefficiency of iterative optimization [19, 24, 39, 43, 44, 45, 47, 61, 71, 83, 86, 101, 108, 113] by first generating consistent 2D renderings then reconstructing the 3D geometry through fast neural reconstruction. More recently, native 3D diffusion models [16, 32, 36, 76, 87, 90, 99, 102, 110, 115] shifted toward generative modeling within latent 3D spaces, employing VAE-based encoders to learn volumetric or implicit shape priors. In contrast to diffusion models, approaches employ vector-quantized autoencoders [70], casting 3D generation as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem [13, 63, 84]. Later works [12, 14, 27, 67, 80, 85, 114] introduce taskspecific tokenization schemes that directly encode vertexface structures, improving geometric fidelity and local continuity. However, these models still operate as next-token predictors and do not expose an explicit reasoning process. Our method instead pairs an octant-based 3D VQ-VAE with unified 3D-LLM that performs both semantic and geometric chain-of2 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence thought reasoning, leading to better 3D generation and understanding performance. Unified Generation & Understanding. Recent multimodal LLMs have revealed remarkable capability in jointly processing and generating visionlanguage content. Early frameworks [1, 2, 17] extend LLMs with visual encoders for grounded perception, while more recent systems [40, 68, 77, 91, 116] integrate text and image generation through learned visual tokenizers and mixed-modality training. Extending this paradigm to 3D, emerging studies [11, 29, 53, 94, 95] adapt LLMs for 3D understanding using point-cloud or shape embeddings. While effective for perception tasks, these models largely focus on recognition rather than generation. Subsequent efforts [15, 80, 104, 106, 117] attempt to unify language and 3D modeling by developing generative LLMs that handle both understanding and generation within shared representation space. More interactive paradigms, such as LL3M [49] and L3GO [97], employ agent-based reasoning to iteratively construct or edit 3D scenes, yet rely on symbolic planning rather than token-level 3D reasoning. In contrast, our approach integrates semantic and geometric reasoning within unified 3D-LLM. By explicitly modeling the reasoning process across both language and 3D token spaces, CoRe3D achieves reasoning-aware 3D understanding and generation, bridging the gap between linguistic intent and physically grounded 3D synthesis. 3. Method 3.1. Preliminaries Reinforcement learning has recently become dominant tool for eliciting reasoning behaviors in large models. particularly effective variant is Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [60], which modifies Policy Proximal Optimization (PPO) by discarding the explicit value function and instead normalizing rewards within sampled group of trajectories. Formally, given promptanswer pair (p, a), the generates group of candidate old policy πθold . Each response is scored by responses {oi} i=1 reward model, yielding ℛi . To reduce variance and emphasize relative quality, the advantage of the i-th response is defined by standardizing rewards within the group: , (1) j=1) ℛi j=1) Ai = µ({ℛj} σ({ℛj}G where µ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation. The learning objective follows the clipped surrogate structure of PPO, but with direct KL penalty that anchors the updated policy πθ to reference distribution πθref : 𝒥GRPO(θ) = ({oi}G i=1 i=1 oi t=1 [ 1 i= oi ( min (ri,t(θ)Ai, clip(ri,t(θ), 1 ε, 1 + ε)Ai) βDKL(πθ πθref))], (2) where the importance ratio at each token step is ri,t(θ) = πθ(oi,t p, oi,<t) πθold(oi,t p, oi,<t) . (3) . Here, ε controls the clipping range of the importance ratio, and β determines the strength of the KL penalty that keeps the updated policy close to the reference policy πθref While GRPO has been applied mainly in text reasoning (e.g., math or code generation), its principle of relative quality comparison remains under-explored in 3D generation. Leveraging this idea, we evaluate groups of rollout trajectoriesspanning both semantic plans and geometric refinementsagainst one another, where their relative ranking provides stable optimization signal that aligns outputs with semantic intent and geometric plausibility. Octree-based Autoregressive Model. Recent 3D transformers such as OctFormer [74] demonstrate that representing 3D data using an octree hierarchy enables efficient global reasoning while preserving local geometric detail. Instead of processing dense voxel grids, an octree partitions the 3D space into hierarchical cubic cells (octants) of adaptive resolution, allocating finer subdivisions in geometrically complex regions and coarser ones in uniform areas. Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 2: CoRe3D overview. Semantic and geometric reasoning tokens are generated by our unified 3D-LLM, and the generated 3D object and corresponding multiviews are evaluated by an ensemble of critics. This sparse yet structured representation significantly reduces memory and computation costs compared to dense attention over all voxels. Formally, an octree representation can be described as set of hierarchical nodes 𝒪 = {ok ℓ ℓ [0, L), ℐℓ}, where ℓ denotes the level in the tree and indexes the spatial position at that level. Each node ok encodes geometric and visual features (e.g., ocℓ cupancy, color, or normal) aggregated from its eight child nodes at level ℓ+1. The model applies transformer attention hierarchically across this structure: intra-level attention aggregates context among nodes within the same resolution, while inter-level attention propagates information between parent and child nodes to capture cross-scale dependencies. This design provides two key advantages: (1) it maintains spatial locality, allowing the model to focus computation on occupied regions, and (2) it establishes natural coarse-to-fine reasoning pathway across the 3D volume. In our work, we adopt simplified variant of this idea by discretizing the latent 3D volume into uniform 222 octant blocks rather than an adaptive octree hierarchy. Each octant token thus serves as fixed-resolution counterpart to an octree node, preserving the locality of the model while enabling autoregressive reasoning through the geometric CoT process described in the following sections. 3.2. Semantic and Geometric Representations Semantic-Level Representation. core challenge in 3D generation is translating open-ended language into structured reasoning signals that preserve compositional semantics and physical constraints. Directly mapping prompts into latent 3D tokens is under-specified, as language descriptions typically omit precise geometric, relational, and material cues, resulting in generated shapes that capture coarse appearance but fail to recover consistent structure or texture details. To address this gap, we introduce semantic CoT reasoning stage that expands each textual prompt into an explicit structural plan before geometry generation. Given an input description and an optional reasoning instruction, the unified 3D-LLM first produces detailed natural language description of the object category, spatial layout, 4 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence materials, and appearance details. This description serves as an interpretable, text-based scaffold that anchors the subsequent geometric reasoning process. Formally, we represent the semantic reasoning trace as sequence of tokens 𝒮sem = [s1, s2, . . . , sN], conditioned on the image prompt and reasoning instruction. These tokens are optimized jointly with 3D generation tokens, enabling semantic intent to directly modulate spatial synthesis during training. Geometric-Level Representation. We represent each 3D object using 643 voxel grid, which provides balanced trade-off between spatial fidelity and computational efficiency. To obtain compact token representation, 3D VQ-VAE encoder maps the voxel grid to 163 latent grid, preserving local geometry and appearance features. The latent grid is serialized into 4096 latent vectors, each corresponding to spatial location. To further reduce sequence length, we group every 222 neighborhood of latent voxels (eight adjacent cells) by concatenating their channels into single vector. This operation transforms the 4096 latent vectors (with 8-D channels) into 512 tokens with 64-D channels, where each token represents local octant block within the 3D volume. vector-quantization module with an 8192-entry codebook discretizes these octant features, resulting in 512 discrete 3D tokens per object. For spatial disambiguation across blocks, we attach learned absolute position embedding to each octant token, keyed by its (xb, yb, zb) index on the 888 block grid (or an equivalent Morton/Z-order code). This embedding is injected post-quantization, so the codebook remains content-centric while the generator remains location-aware. This octant-based representation naturally supports our geometric CoT reasoning: the model iteratively thinks over octant tokens, refining or sampling candidate completions for each sub-cube. We denote the sequence of geometric reasoning tokens as 𝒢geo = [g1, g2, . . . , gM], (4) where each token gi corresponds to discrete octant block produced by the 3D VQ-VAE. While the semantic CoT 𝒮sem expresses the conceptual plan in language space, the geometric CoT 𝒢geo realizes that plan token-by-token in the 3D latent space. Together, these two reasoning levels enable controllable and interpretable 3D generation that preserves both global semantics and local geometric precision. 3.3. Collaborative Reasoning The core innovation of our framework lies in the explicit collaboration between semantic and geometric reasoning. While each level can operate independently, its joint optimization leads to stronger, mutually reinforcing behavior. We unify them through 3D Co-GRPO, reinforcement learning framework that refines both reasoning levels using multi-critic 3Daware rewards, aligning linguistic intent with spatial construction. This results in objects that are semantically faithful, visually compelling, and physically coherent. An overview is shown in fig. 2. and preFormally, given an input prompt Tp generated semantic CoT decoded from 𝒮sem, the unified 3D-LLM produces geometric reasoning sequence 𝒢geo = [g1, g2, . . . , gM] to synthesize the final 3D object ˆO. The process can be viewed as sequential reasoning pipeline: the semantic trace 𝒮sem provides global planning cues such as object category, spatial relations, and texture details, while the geometric trace 𝒢geo progressively realizes those cues within the latent 3D token space. We extend the Generalized Reinforcement Preference Optimization (GRPO) paradigm into the 3D domain by introducing four complementary critics, each providing scalar reward that captures distinct dimension of 3D quality. The resulting meshes and multi-view renderings {Ii} are evaluated by an ensemble of 3D experts: Human Preference Critic: evaluates perceptual realism and human aesthetic preference, assessing prompt relevance and overall visual appeal from multi-view renderings [88, 93, 103]. 3D Understanding Critic: verifies attributeand part-level correctness using 3D-VQA models [11, 29, 53, 117] that query geometric, textural, and symmetry attributes derived from the semantic CoT 𝒮sem. Text3D Alignment Critic: measures semantic faithfulness between the textual reasoning trace (prompt and 𝒮sem) and the generated geometry 5 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence 𝒢geo, using pretrained text3D embedding models [96, 106] to ensure cross-modal coherence and faithful alignment. Physical Coherence Critic: analytically enforces structural stability and physical plausibility through differentiable reward composed of three geometrybased terms: RP = λ1Rstab + λ2Rrig + λ3Rint, where Rstab measures global balance of the center of mass, Rrig promotes topologically connected geometry that maintains physical continuity, and Rint penalizes self-intersection between surfaces. This critic is fully geometry-driven and provides compact measure of physical coherence. Each critic outputs normalized reward Ri [0, 1], and the overall GRPO objective aggregates them via = wH RH + wV RV + wX RX + wPRP, (5) where weights balance human preference, 3D understanding, cross-modal alignment, and physical coherence. The combined reward provides preference signals for policy updates, encouraging the model to improve both reasoning accuracy and geometric fidelity over GRPO iterations. During training, the model first performs forward generation to produce 𝒮sem and 𝒢geo for each prompt . Generated results are rendered into multi-view Tp images and passed through the four critics, producing individual rewards {RH, RV, RX, RP}. The composite reward in Eq. (5) is then used to compute pairwise preferences among samples and update the model using the GRPO objective defined in Eq. (2). 4. Experiments Implementation Details. Our training data is sourced from the 3D-Alpaca dataset [104], which comprises approximately 2.56M multimodal samples spanning text-to-3D, image-to-3D, 3D-captioning, and 3D-editing tasks. Each 3D asset is rendered from four orthogonal views and paired with GPTgenerated captions, providing rich interleaved supervision across modalities. We initialize our 3DULM from ShapeLLM-Omni [104], which we extend with our octant-based 3D VQ-VAE for compact geometry representation and geometric CoT reasoning.

For reward computation, we render multi-view images for each generated mesh and evaluate them using HPS [88] for the Human Preference Critic, ShapeLLM [53] for the 3D Understanding Critic, and ULIP [96] embeddings for the Text3D Alignment Critic. Finally, the Physical Coherence Critic is implemented through geometry-based evaluation on the generated meshes. Given each generated mesh. All critic scores are normalized to [0, 1] and fused as in Eq. 5 to guide policy optimization under the GRPO objective (Eq. 2). More details in the Appendix. 4.1. Quantitative Results General Conversational Abilities. We first evaluate the foundational language understanding of CoRe3D. We compare against leading general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-vl-7B [98], LLaMA3.2-Vision-11B [69]) and 3D-focused multimodal models (LLaMA-Mesh8B [80], ShapeLLM-Omni-7B [104]) on suite of standard language benchmarks. These include MMLU [28], PIQA [6], GSM8K [20], and SIQA [58]. As shown in Table 1, CoRe3D maintains its general conversational abilities with good language understanding and reasoning performance. These results suggest that our co-reasoning mechanism does not diminish the models broader reasoning capabilities but instead strengthens them. 6 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 3: Image-to-3D qualitative comparison. Given single input image, CoRe3D produces 3D shapes with higher geometric fidelity, cleaner topology, and stronger semantic alignment compared to baselines.

These results quantitatively confirm that our co-reasoning method substantially improves 3D understanding. 7 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 4: Text-to-3D qualitative comparison. CoRe3D generates 3D objects that more faithfully follow the textual prompt. 3D-Generation. We evaluate the core generative capabilities of CoRe3D on both Text-to-3D and Imageto-3D synthesis. We compare against several leading methods, including SAR3D [15], CLAY [110], Trellis [90], and ShapeLLM-Omni [104]. We use three standard metrics: CLIP Score, Frechet Distance (FD), and Kernel Distance (KD) to assess the generation quality. As shown in Table 3, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in the Text-to-3D task, demonstrating clear gain by ranking first across all three metrics. Our high CLIP score is direct quantitative validation of our core contribution: the Semantic CoT, jointly optimized with GRPO and Text-3D Alignment Critic, successfully made our model more faithful to the text. This strong performance extends to Image-to-3D generation, where our model leads in prompt alignment (CLIP 85.9) and maintains promising quality compared to the state-of-the-art 3D generation-only models. 4.2. Qualitative results Standard 3D Generation. We first evaluate CoRe3D on standard image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks, comparing it against strong baselines, including the unified 3D models ShapeLLM-Omni [104] and SAR3D [15], as well as the generation-focused models Trellis [90] and CLAY [110]. As illustrated in Figure 3, competing methods often exhibit misalignment with the input image or suffer from geometric artifacts. In contrast, our model generates 3D meshes with high geometric fidelity and semantic coherence, faithfully capturing the complex structures present in the source image. This superior performance extends to text-to-3D generation, as shown in Figure 4. Our model achieves more robust alignment with the text prompt. Notably, CoRe3D successfully interprets and renders fine-grained stylistic details, such as the cartoon\" attribute, producing 3D meshes that align precisely with the prompts intention. Reasoning-based 3D Generation. The robust understanding capabilities of CoRe3D unlock more challenging class of 3D generation: synthesis from complex or indirect prompts. These prompts often require world knowledge and compositional reasoning to infer the users true intent (e.g., inferring Statue of Liberty from colossal copper figure holding torch ... symbolizing freedom and hope). 8 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 5: Qualitative results of CoRe3D on challenging prompts that require inferring the correct object or interpreting implicit descriptive cues. Comparing with the base model ShapeLLM-Omni [104] and state-of-the-art generation model Trellis [90], our model successfully inferred the true object from the implicit prompts. (e.g., colossal copper figure holding torch ... symbolizing freedom and hope corresponds to The Statue of Liberty.) Figure 6: Qualitative results on 3D part editing. The collaborative reasoning in our framework enhances yielding instruction comprehension, edits that align more faithfully with the input text and produce 3D shapes that accurately reflect the specified modifications. Standard models, which lack an explicit reasoning stage, fail at this task, generating literal but semantically incorrect shapes. As demonstrated in Figure 5, CoRe3D successfully navigates these challenges. Our models Semantic-CoT first deconstructs the ambiguous prompt into structured steps and effectively infers the underlying intention, allowing our model to produce 3D objects that maintain high faithfulness to the prompts true meaning. 3D Part Editing.

As shown in Figure 6, our model can perform fine-grained part-level edits while preserving object identity and structural coherence. Additional results are provided in the Appendix. 4.3. Ablations Semantic-CoT and Geometric-CoT. We ablate CoRe3D by removing either the Semantic-CoT tokens or the Geometric-CoT tokens for the GRPO pipeline. As shown in Figure 7, removing Semantic-CoT leads to structurally plausible objects but lacks categoryand attribute-specific cues. Conversely, removing 9 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Table 4: Ablation of different critics.

Reward analysis We analyze the role of each critic and their combinations to better understand how different reward signals shape model behavior. As shown in Table 4, each critic contributes complementary improvements. Text3D alignment yields the largest gains in caption quality, showing its importance for accurate descriptions. 3D Understanding significantly improves generation quality by enforcing stronger object-level structure. Combining multiple critics steadily improves performance: pairs such as (3DU + TA + PC) or (HP + TA + PC) achieve balanced improvements across both captioning and generation tasks. More details in the Appendix 5. Conclusion We introduce CoRe3D, collaborative reasoning framework that unifies semantic planning and geometric construction through dual chain-of-thought process. By coupling these complementary reasoning levels and optimizing them jointly with 3D CoGRPO, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across both 3D generation and understanding tasks. Beyond producing faithful and physically coherent 3D assets, CoRe3D demonstrates robust interpretive capabilities, successfully handling indirect and referring descriptions, ambiguous prompts, and fine-grained part-level edits. Our results highlight collaborative reasoning as scalable and structureaware foundation for general 3D intelligence."

Implementation Details Post-Pretraining Reinforcement Learning. Since the introduction of Chain-of-Thought prompting [81], enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models has become an important research focus. More recently, DeepSeek-R1 [26] advanced this direction by proposing rule-based reward design combined with GRPO training, encouraging models to produce explicit intermediate reasoning traces before generating final answers. This paradigm has since been extended to multimodal settings [31, 50, 100, 109], where task-specific rewards guide the learning process. These reasoningdriven methods have achieved notable gains across variety of challenging tasks [46], including mathematical problem solving [111, 112] and code generation [33, 42]. Our proposed CoRe3D framework builds on this line of work by extending GRPO from text-only settings to unified 3D understanding and 3D generation model. We employ collaborative reasoning strategy that tightly couples linguistic semantics with 3D geometry, leading to more coherent and interpretable generation. Octant-based 3D Representations. The concept of octree has been used in wide range of 3D geometric processing applications, including point cloud compression [59], 3D texturing [5, 92], and multi-view scene reconstruction [65, 107]. Beyond these foundational uses, octree structures have become integral to efficient shape analysis in large-scale environments [25, 57, 74, 75, 89]. In the realm of generative modeling, recent advancements [22, 22, 82] employ adaptive tokenization or multi-scale autoregressive strategies resources to allocate computational to geometrically complex regions dynamically. Diverging from these adaptive hierarchical methods, which often result in variable-length sequences or complex tree traversals, our approach utilizes fixedresolution octant-based 3D VQ-VAE to discretize the 3D volume into uniform blocks. This design preserves essential spatial locality while maintaining compact token sequence, thereby facilitating stable and interpretable geometric chain-of-thought reasoning within unified 3D-LLM framework. Octant-based Auto-regressive Model. Autoregressive generation over 3D volumetric representations poses unique challenge: the model must preserve spatial locality while maintaining tractable token length. Traditional raster-order serialization severely disrupts locality in 3D, making next-token prediction unnecessarily difficult. Inspired by ideas from hierarchical octant-based models such as OctFormer [74] and OctGPT [82], we adopt an octant-structured tokenization strategy tailored to our VQ-VAE latent space. Unlike hierarchical octrees, our formulation operates on single-scale 163 latent grid while preserving the locality benefits emphasized in prior octant-based architectures. As shown in Figure 8, our voxel VQ-VAE maps each 643 input volume to 163 latent grid. To reduce sequence length while preserving local geometric structure, we partition this latent grid into nonoverlapping 222 neighborhoods. Each neighborhood forms local octant block that contains eight spatially adjacent latent cells. Concatenating the features of these eight cells produces single octant token, yielding exactly 888 = 512 tokens per object. These tokens summarize compact spatial regions and maintain local geometry and appearance cues. To serialize the latent volume into an autoregressive sequence, we employ Morton (Z-order) space-filling curve, which preserves spatial locality more effectively than raster or lexicographic scanning. Let 𝒪 = [o1, o2, . . . , o512] denote the sequence of octant tokens arranged in Morton order. The generative process factorizes the distribution over the latent volume as p(𝒪) = 512 i=1 p(oi o<i, 𝒮sem), (6) where the semantic chain-of-thought 𝒮sem provides high-level cues that guide geometric synthesis. To encode spatial location, we attach learned positional embedding to each octant token, keyed by its block index (xb, yb, zb) in the 888 grid. This embedding is injected after vector quantization, ensuring that the codebook remains content-centric while the autoregressive decoder remains location19 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 8: Overview of Octant-based 3D VQVAE. The voxelized geometry is encoded into latent blocks, quantized using shared codebook of 3D embeddings, and decoded back into high-fidelity voxel grid. aware. Together, the octant blocks and positional embeddings introduce two inductive biases: (i) each token carries high-resolution local geometric context, and (ii) the sequence ordering respects 3D locality. During training, the semantic reasoning trace 𝒮sem and the geometric reasoning trace 𝒢geo jointly condition the autoregressive transformer. The semantic trace encodes global planning information such as categories and textures, while the geometric trace provides localized structural cues for neighborhood-level voxel refinement. The decoder predicts discrete codebook index for each octant token, reconstructing the latent volume block-by-block. After predicting all 512 tokens, the VQ-VAE decoder reconstructs dense 643 voxel field, which is subsequently rendered into mesh or multi-view images. Compared to hierarchical octree models [82], which must autoregressively generate thousands of binary split or leaf tokens, our design yields significantly shorter and more expressive sequence. This compact, locality-aware autoregressive formulation is essential to our framework, enabling efficient token-level generation that tightly aligns with semantic and geometric reasoning. Physical Coherence Critic. We use Trimesh to compute physical statistics and PyMeshFix to diagnose self-intersections. Stability is estimated by projecting the mesh center of mass onto the ground plane and checking whether this projection lies inside the convex hull of bottom support vertices extracted from the lowest-z region, yielding normalized stability score. Structural connectivity is measured by splitting the mesh into connected components and computing the fraction of faces belonging to the largest component, which penalizes fragmented or floating parts. To assess self-intersection, we run PyMeshFix on the original mesh and compare the number of faces before and after repair; larger relative change indicates more severe geometric artifacts and results in lower self-intersection score. Hyperparameters. The policy is updated using KLregularized GRPO with ratio clipping. The KL penalty coefficient is set to β = 0.01 and the clipping threshold to ε=0.1. For each prompt, we sample K=4 candidate generations and compute pairwise preferences using the four critics introduced in 3. The humanpreference, 3D-understanding, Text-3D-alignment, and Physical coherence critics are weighted by (wH, wV, wX, wP) = (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25). Optimiza6, tion uses AdamW with learning rate of 1 10 β1=0.9, β2=0.98, and weight decay 0.01. We apply 2000-step linear warmup followed by cosine decay. For stability, the policy KL is capped at 1.2 its exponential moving average, and gradients are clipped with global norm of 1.0. Evaluation Metrics. We report common textgeneration metrics, i.e.,, BLEU-1 [51], ROUGE-L [38], and METEOR [4]. Although standard, these metrics often favor shorter outputs and may overlook semantic fidelity. To address this, we incorporate embedding-based similarity measures, including Sentence-BERT [56] and SimCSE [23], which evaluate semantic alignment between generated captions and human references more robustly. 20 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 9: Additional Results on Challenging Prompts. CoRe3D successfully inferred the true object from the implicit prompts. C. Additional Results Additional Results on Challenging Prompts. Figure 9 presents additional qualitative examples demonstrating CoRe3Ds ability to infer the correct 3D object even when the input prompt provides only indirect or symbolic descriptions. These prompts intentionally avoid naming the target object and instead describe cultural context, functional cues, or high-level visual impressions. Despite this ambiguity, CoRe3D consistently recovers the correct underlying structure. As shown, the model not only identifies the implicit object but also reconstructs spatially coherent and visually faithful 3D shape. To our knowledge, CoRe3D is the first 3D generative framework capable of resolving such implicit, referential prompts through semantic reasoning, rather than relying on explicit object mentions or category supervision. Quantitative Results of Semantic-CoT and Geometric CoT Ablation. We conduct quantitative analysis to isolate the contributions of the two complementary reasoning CoTs. As shown in Table 5, introducing Semantic CoT yields the largest gains in 3D captioning quality, improving METEOR, SentenceBERT, and SimCSE scores by significant margin over ShapeLLM-Omni. This indicates that explicit semantic reasoning helps the model better decompose text prompts into linguistically grounded object attributes. In contrast, Geometric CoT primarily benefits 3D generation. By encouraging structured it spatial reasoning over octant-level geometry, substantially improves CLIP similarity and reduces both FD and KD, demonstrating its effectiveness in guiding the model toward globally coherent 3D shapes. Our full model, CoRe3D, achieves the best overall performance across all metrics. These results verify that collaborative reasoning is essential for robust 3D understanding and generation. Comparison with Zero-shot CoT. Figure 10 and Figure 11 compare our trained semantic-level CoT with zero-shot CoT baseline (Qwen2.5-vl-7B[3]). In the zero-shot setting, the model is prompted to produce free-form structural description before generating the 3D object, but this unguided semantic reasoning pro21 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Table 5: Ablation of Semantic CoT and Geometric CoT.

For instance, in the compact car example, the zero-shot CoT yields generic outline of smooth white prototype with no color, style cues, or structural modifiers, leading to an oversimplified reconstruction. In contrast, the CoRe3D semantic-level CoT produces richer and more actionable structural cues, such as bright blue body color, semi-transparent windows, stylized panel lines, or the presence of roof rack with parallel bars and fin-like rear element (bottom CoT row), and the model correspondingly reconstructs much more faithful 3D shape. These results show that zeroshot CoT lacks the necessary semantic grounding for 3D generation, whereas CoRe3D learns to produce CoT that is both structurally informative and tightly aligned with the generation process. This highlights the necessity of our collaborative reasoning pipeline. Additional Image-to-3D Results. Figure 12 shows additional qualitative results from our image-to-3D pipeline. Despite being unified model rather than specialized reconstruction system, CoRe3D generates stable and coherent 3D shapes even from visually complex or cluttered inputs. The model maintains globally consistent geometry, plausible spatial structure, and strong color fidelity, delivering reconstructions that capture the essential form, material cues, and overall visual identity of the input objects. Optimal Octant Layers. Table 6 evaluates how the choice of octant depth and therefore the total number of octant tokens affects the performance of our octantbased 3D VQ-VAE. Increasing the depth refines the spatial partitioning of the latent volume (from 8 to 4096 octants), granting the model access to progressively finer geometric detail. We observe consistent upward trend from Depth 1 to Depth 3 across all captioning and generation metrics. Depth 1 (only 8 octants) severely under-parameterizes local geometry, leading to weak semantic alignment and the worst FD/KD scores. Depth 2 (64 octants) recovers coarse global structure but still lacks local detail, resulting in moderate improvements. Depth 3 provides the best balance between spatial granularity and autoregressive stability. It achieves the highest scores for METEOR, SimCSE, CLIP, and the lowest FD/KD, demonstrating that this level of decomposition offers enough local resolution to capture high-frequency geometry without excessively lengthening the autoregressive sequence. We use Depth 3 as our default. At Depth 4, although the finer subdivision (4096 octants) slightly improves SBERT similarity and CLIP alignment, overall performance begins to degrade. Optimal Codebook Size. Table 7 evaluates how the capacity of the VQ-VAE codebook affects both semantic alignment and 3D generation fidelity. small codebook (2048 entries) creates severe quantization bottleneck. This under-expressiveness leads to noticeably lower METEOR, SBERT, and 22 Collaborative Reasoning as Foundation for 3D Intelligence Figure 10: Comparison with Zero-shot CoT. Zero-shot CoT produces shallow, generic structural descriptions, leading to oversimplified 3D shapes. eration can streamline asset creation and accelerate workflows in engineering and education. At the same time, such frameworks carry several potential risks. Unified 3D models may unintentionally reproduce private or proprietary content, and generative pipelines could be misused to create realistic yet deceptive 3D assets. CoRe3D is intended for research and educational use, and we encourage responsible deployment that emphasizes transparency, provenance tracking, consent for training data, and adherence to domain-specific usage guidelines. With such measures in place, we believe the benefits of collaborative reasoning for 3D understanding and generation outweigh the potential risks. SimCSE scores, along with substantially worse FD/KD metrics. Increasing the codebook to 4096 entries alleviates this issue and yields consistent gains across all evaluation dimensions. Our default setting with an 8192-entry codebook achieves the best overall performance. Expanding the codebook further to 16384 entries results in only marginal improvements on SBERT and CLIP similarity, but degrades generation fidelity. These findings indicate that our 8192-entry codebook is the optimal. D. Broader Impacts CoRe3D advances unified 3D intelligence by enabling models to both interpret and construct 3D objects through collaborative semanticgeometricreasoning. Such capabilities can benefit wide spectrum of applications. In robotics and embodied AI, improved spatial reasoning may support better manipulation, affordance understanding, and task planning.
