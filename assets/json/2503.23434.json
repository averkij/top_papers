            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have rapidly evolved from question answering tools to agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) through clicks and on-screen parsing (Nguyen et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024c; Xie et al., 2024). Deployed on websites, desktops, mobile apps, and diverse software environments, these GUI agents promise wide-ranging applications from automated testing and e-commerce to assistive technologies for users with disabilities (Zhao et al., 2024; Cuadra et al., 2024). Their ability to interpret dynamic interfaces, understand multimodal inputs, and execute precise actions is reshaping how large foundation models assist human operators in routine digital tasks. As GUI agents become more capable and begin to play more significant role in real-world applications, ensuring their trustworthiness has become increasingly critical. Compared to traditional NLP tasks where inputs and outputs are relatively static and limited to textual data, GUI agents can operate in dynamic environments with inputs and outputs in different modalities. Although this flexibility improves utility, it also introduces new risks, which makes security, reliability, and transparency critical for responsible deployment (Arnold and Tilton, 2024; Ma et al., 2024). However, existing research on GUI agents focuses mainly on functional performance metrics, such as task completion rates, while often overlooking essential aspects like security, reliability, and transparency (Arnold and Tilton, 2024; Ma et al., 2024). This oversight poses significant risks, especially in high-stakes environments where these agents operate. Several emerging attacks have exposed these risks: adversarial image perturbations can deceive perception modules (Wu et al., 2025a), malicious webpage elements can manipulate agent behavior (Wu et al., 2024a), and screenshot-based navigation can inadvertently expose sensitive user data (Chen et al., 2024a). Beyond these threats, the broader social implications are equally pressing. As the brain of GUI agents, the trustworthiness of LLMs and LMMs is crucial because it directly impacts the outcomes of GUI interactions (Liu et al., 2023c; Weidinger et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2024b). In critical domains such as finance and healthcare, trustworthy LLMs and LMMs ensure that decisions made by GUI agents are secure, ethical, transparent, and aligned with human values. Addressing these challenges requires assessing and mitigating risks from different aspects. Here, we categorize the trustworthiness in GUI agents into five key areas: 1. Security: Protecting agents against adversarial manipulation, unauthorized command execution, and data leaks. For instance, WebPI (Wu et al., Figure 1: An evolutionary tree of research on trustworthy GUI agents. Each branch represents research direction, with notable works color-coded by their focus area, demonstrating how the field has evolved toward more comprehensive trustworthiness considerations. This figure is adapted from this repo. 2024a) demonstrates how hidden HTML elements can mislead agents into executing unintended actions, posing security risks. 2. Reliability: Ensuring GUI agents function correctly across dynamic interfaces with reliable response. Studies on multimodal agent safety (Liu et al., 2023b) highlight risks where GUI agents may misinterpret visual cues, leading to unsafe or unintended interactions. 3. Explainability: Making agent decision-making processes more interpretable and user-friendly. Systems like EBC-LLMAgent (Guan et al., 2024) enhance transparency by learning from user demos to generate clear and interpretable action sequences with corresponding UI mappings and rationales. 4. Ethical Alignment: Ensuring agents adhere to human values and cultural norms. CASA (Qiu et al., 2024) evaluates agents on social and ethical considerations, emphasizing fairness in decisionmaking across diverse user populations. 5. Evaluation: Developing rigorous testing methods to assess GUI agent behavior under real-world conditions. ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024) evaluates policy compliance and risk mitigation strategies for web-based agents. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of research across these dimensions. While previous surveys (Nguyen et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024a; Hu et al.; Liu et al., 2025b) primarily focus on the task performance of GUI agents, our work highlights less-explored issues like security, reliability, and transparency, and emerging mitigation strategies for these issues. Our discussion begins with an overview of GUI agent architectures and fundamental capabilities (Section 2). We then examine security and privacy challenges (Section 3) and strategies for enhancing reliability and harmlessness (Section 4). Next, we discuss the importance of explainability and transparency (Section 5) and outline ethical considerations for responsible deployment (Section 6). We conclude by reviewing evaluation methodologies (Section 7) and highlighting future research directions (Section 8). Overall, this survey shifts the focus from task success to holistic trustworthiness, offering researchers and developers insights into the risks, challenges, and solutions for creating secure and responsible GUI agents."

            "title": "2 Foundation of GUI Agents",
            "content": "GUI agents leverage large foundation models to integrate perception, reasoning, planning, and execution, enabling interaction with user interfaces in human-like manner. This section outlines their key components, applications, and challenges. standard agent pipeline includes multimodal perception, reasoning and planning (task decomposition), and interaction mechanisms (clicks, text entries, and other UI actions) (Wright, 2024; Zhou et al., 2023). For perception, some rely on accessibility APIs, while others parse HTML/DOM structures or process raw screenshots. Hybrid approaches combine these methods for more reliable understanding (Wu et al., 2024c; Nong et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2023). For interaction, agents perform tasks through replicating human-like interactions, such as clicking or typing (Koh et al., 2024a). Beyond the above perception and interaction, effective task decomposition is core capability for GUI agents to navigate complex workflows and adapt to dynamic interfaces. structured planning mechanism allows agents to decompose multi-step tasks and execute actions reliably across diverse environments (Gu et al., 2024a; Zhu et al., 2025; Koh et al., 2024b). GUI agents can serve diverse applications. In mobile settings, they automate navigation and data entry via hierarchical planning (Nong et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025). On the web, they can support tasks such as automated testing, phishing detection, and e-commerce applications (Cao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Gu et al., 2024b). In specialized domains like healthcare and education, they assist multimodal reasoning while ensuring privacy and accessibility (Cuadra et al., 2024; Arnold and Tilton, 2024; Srinivas et al., 2024). Despite recent advances, key challenges remain. Agents are still vulnerable to adversarial multimodal inputs, which can trigger unpredictable behavior (Gao et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024). They also struggle to generalize to unfamiliar interfaces, highlighting the need for stronger robustness (Kim et al., 2024b). Additionally, balancing real-time performance with safety remains an ongoing challenge, necessitating more efficient architectures (Shen et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024b). As GUI agents are increasingly deployed in realworld scenarios, addressing challenges related to security, reliability, explainability, and ethical alignment becomes essential. The following section examines these dimensions in depth, and we include brief overview of key dimensions for building trustworthy GUI agents in Figure 2."

            "title": "3.1 Attacks and Vulnerabilities",
            "content": "The interactive nature of GUI agents gives rise to novel exploits, including adversarial image perturbations and malicious prompt injections embedded in webpages (Janowczyk et al., 2024). Attacks such as Imprompter (Fu et al., 2024) manipulate single product image to hijack an agents actions with high success rates. Browser-based jailbreaking also emerges, whereby refusal-trained LLMs inadvertently execute harmful behaviors in nonchat contexts (Kumar et al., 2024). Some studies reveal that malicious instructions can be hidden in website structures, where compromised webpages consistently mislead the agent (Wu et al., 2024a). AdvWeb demonstrates how black-box adversarial prompts injected into web pages can mislead web agents into executing unintended actions while remaining undetectable to users (Xu et al., 2024a). On mobile devices, multiple attack paths target both the perception and reasoning modules of multimodal agents, emphasizing the breadth of vulnerabilities (Yang et al., 2024). Similarly, AEIAMN shows that mobile GUI agents are highly vulnerable to environmental injection attacks, where malicious elements disguised as system features disrupt decision-making with up to 93% success rates (Chen et al., 2025). Altogether, these exploits demonstrate that seemingly benign elements, such as small visual perturbations or hidden HTML code, can manipulate complex agent pipelines. Because GUI agents operate across modalities and maintain hidden internal state, such threats can slip through and spread across components over time (Wu et al., 2025a). Ensuring security thus requires holistic view of the GUI agents entire workflow."

            "title": "3.2 Privacy Risks",
            "content": "Beyond security exploits, GUI agents raise pressing privacy concerns by accessing sensitive personal or enterprise data through visual and textual interfaces (Chen et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024b). Screenshot-based perception can be particularly sensitive, potentially exposing private details without user awareness. Furthermore, when agents run in the cloud or on remote servers, the risk of data leakage increases (Gan et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024b). These risks become especially critical when GUI agents interact with regulated domains such as finance and healthcare, where the exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), including names, addresses, and financial details, can have severe consequences. Recent studies highlight emerging threats, such as Environmental Injection Attacks (EIA), which covertly manipulate web environments to extract PII from GUI agents with up to 70% success rates (Liao et al., 2024). Similarly, web-enabled LLM agents have been found to enhance cyberattacks, such as automated PII harvesting, imperFigure 2: Overview of key dimensions for building trustworthy GUI agents, highlighting foundational abilities, evaluation metrics, security threats, reliability, harmfulness, explainability, transparency, and ethical implications. sonation post generation, and spear-phishing (Kim et al., 2024a), which reveals critical gaps in existing security measures. Beyond direct attacks, users may also inadvertently disclose sensitive information during normal interactions with GUI agents, underscoring the need for contextual privacy protections (Ngong et al., 2025)."

            "title": "3.3 Defenses and Mitigation Strategies",
            "content": "Researchers have proposed multiple approaches to mitigate security and privacy risks in GUI agents. Input validation and prompt injection detection aim to filter out unsafe content before it reaches the core model, as demonstrated by Sharma et al. (2024). Other work introduces specialized guardrail agents that intercept and inspect commands generated by primary agents, blocking disallowed actions (Xiang et al., 2024). Some frameworks leverage adversarial training or visual analytics systems, like AdversaFlow (Deng et al., 2024), to identify vulnerabilities collaboratively. AutoDroid enhances mobile GUI automation by integrating language models with dynamic UI analysis, enabling scalable, hands-free task execution across arbitrary Android apps without manual effort (Wen et al., 2024). Similarly, G-Safeguard applies graph-based anomaly detection to multi-agent systems, mitigating prompt injection attacks and securing agent collaboration (Wang et al., 2025). To address privacy, solutions like CLEAR (Chen et al., 2024a) analyze user-provided data and privacy policies to highlight potential leakages. Others advocate secure sandboxing, local processing, and advanced authentication to constrain agent permissions (Zhang et al., 2024b; Gu et al., 2024a). PAPILLON proposes privacy-conscious delegation framework that selectively routes queries between local and proprietary LLMs to minimize sensitive data exposure while maintaining high response quality (Siyan et al., 2024). Recent commercial implementations of GUI agent frameworks also provide valuable insights into multi-layered defense strategies. For example, OpenAIs CUA employs comprehensive defensein-depth approach. This includes preventative measures such as website blocklists and refusal training, interactive safeguards like user confirmations for critical actions, and detection systems for realtime moderation and monitoring of suspicious content (OpenAI, 2025). This strategy recognizes that perfect prevention is unattainable and instead focuses on using complementary systems to gradually reduce risk. On the other hand, Anthropic advises limiting computer use to secure environments, such as virtual machines with minimal privileges, to mitigate ongoing vulnerabilities to jailbreaking and prompt injection (Anthropic, 2025)."

Three promising directions deserve exploration: Smarter Defense Tools: We need lightweight, real-time mechanisms to detect hidden attacks like those demonstrated in AdvWeb (Xu et al., 2024a) and Imprompter (Fu et al., 2024). Browser extensions could sanitize webpage elements before agents process them, while mobile applications might verify UI elements against device sensors to detect overlay attacks similar to those in AEIAMN (Chen et al., 2025).

(2024a). In parallel, recent advances such as ZIP (Shi et al., 2023a) demonstrate how zero-shot image purification techniques can effectively defend against visual backdoor attacks, offering direction for mitigating image-based threats in GUI agents. User-Controlled Privacy: Drawing inspiration from mobile permissions, future GUI agents should request specific, time-limited access to data (e.g., \"view this webpage for 5 minutes\"). Combined with local models that automatically redact personal information and clear activity logs, this approach would give users meaningful control while preserving convenience, as suggested by Zhang et al. (2024b). Users should understand what their agent sees and how their data is used. Connected Defense Layers: Since GUI agents process multiple types of information (images, text, system states), defenses should verify consistency across channels (Wu et al., 2025a). For instance, an agent should cross-check text from button image with the underlying HTML to catch any possible tampering. In high-stakes scenarios like payments or accessing healthcare data, agents should leverage hardware-based security checking approach and require explicit user confirmation for any suspicious or sensitive actions, following ideas similar to those in Xiang et al. (2024)."

            "title": "4.1 Reliability",
            "content": "Ensuring stable and accurate interaction with visual interfaces is essential for GUI agents, especially in tackling the challenge of hallucination, where agents generate actions or interpretations that do not match the visual content (Bai et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024d). Such errors can include fabricated UI elements, incorrect readings of interface components, or lapses in visual focus, all of which can lead to unreliable behavior (Liu et al., 2023a; Jiang et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2024). Furthermore, recent work (Ma et al., 2024) also reveals that even in benign, non-malicious environments, multimodal GUI agents are vulnerable to environmental distractions that undermine their reliability. To mitigate these issues, several strategies have been developed. Opera introduces an over-trust penalty to prevent reliance on misleading summary tokens (Huang et al., 2024a), while Volcano employs self-feedback for natural language correction (Lee et al., 2023). Contrastive learning techniques help distinguish between hallucinative and non-hallucinative text, enhancing model robustness (Jiang et al., 2024a). Real-time detection frameworks like UNIHD validate outputs against visual evidence, and methods such as Residual Visual Decoding address \"hallucination snowballing\" by revising outputs with residual visual input (Chen et al., 2024d; Zhong et al., 2024). Specialized datasets like LRV-Instruction and M-HalDetect further aid in reducing hallucination rates by providing targeted training resources (Liu et al., 2023a; Gunjal et al., 2023). Multi-agent systems also offer promising solutions by combining self-correction, external feedback, and agent debate to maintain accurate grounding in complex interactions (Yu et al., 2024)."

            "title": "4.2 Content Safety",
            "content": "Because GUI agents can generate and display multimodal content, ensuring safe and appropriate outputs is critical (Gao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023b). Image-based manipulations may prompt harmful or toxic responses, undermining the base LLMs alignment. Tailored calibration approaches, such as CoCA (Gao et al., 2024), attempt to restore the models original safety guardrails under multimodal contexts. Recent work by Zou et al. (2024) introduces \"circuit breakers\" that can interrupt GUI agents when generating harmful outputs, functioning effectively even against sophisticated adversarial attacks in multimodal settings. Similarly, frameworks like RapGuard (Jiang et al., 2024b) dynamically generate scenario-specific safety prompts to reduce risks in each interaction. Recent work on self-defense mechanisms offers promising strategies to protect GUI agents from manipulation. Phute et al. (2023) demonstrated that agents can effectively filter their own responses to block harmful content generation while not sacrificing functionality. Moving on, Xie et al. (2023) developed complementary \"system-mode selfreminder\" technique, which wraps user queries in prompts that reinforce safe behavior. This method reduced jailbreak attack success rates from 67% to 19%. For agents handling sensitive tasks, Greenblatt et al. (2023) proposed robust safety protocols like \"trusted editing\" and \"untrusted monitoring\" that remain effective even when the agent actively tries to bypass them. At the model level, Liu et al. (2024) introduced Selective Knowledge Unlearning (SKU) to remove harmful knowledge from the underlying models powering GUI agents while preserving performance on legitimate tasks. In practice, content safety depends on the agents ability to reject unsafe requests, avoid exposing sensitive information, and handle ambiguous inputs responsibly. To catch potential harms before deployment, frameworks like AHA! (Anticipating Harms of AI)(Buçinca et al., 2023) support developers in identifying how different AI behaviors might negatively impact various stakeholders. AHA! creates example scenarios that show different ways agent systems can go wrong, based on responses from both crowd workers and language models. Interactive benchmarks such as ST-WebAgentBench highlight how easily agent alignment can fail when faced with real-world websites (Levy et al., 2024). Overall, adding stronger content filtering throughout the pipeline, along with consistent logging of agent actions, can help limit the impact when alignment breaks down."

            "title": "4.3 Alignment with Human Values",
            "content": "Aligning GUI agents with human values means weighing individual user goals, like efficiency and personalization, against broader concerns such as fairness and inclusivity. One approach is to define these principles up front, as in Hua et al. (2024), where agent constitutions are used to embed safety guidelines during the planning process. Other frameworks, such as ResponsibleTA (Zhang et al., 2023), structure collaboration among multiple agent components to verify each steps feasibility and security. FREYR introduces modular approach to tool integration in LLMs, improving adaptability to user needs without requiring extensive model fine-tuning (Gallotta et al., 2025). Moral reasoning and cultural sensitivity are increasingly relevant, particularly when agents operate in diverse contexts or handle sensitive content (Qiu et al., 2024; Piatti et al., 2024). To achieve deeper alignment, agents may need to model nuanced social norms or policy constraints. VisualCritic demonstrates how LMMs can assess visual content quality from human perspective, critical capability for ensuring user-aligned perception in GUI interactions (Huang et al., 2024b). Commercial GUI agent implementations provide further insights into practical alignment strategies. OpenAIs CUA, for example, implements \"watch mode\" on sensitive websites (e.g., email) to ensure that critical operations are supervised by users, and it declines higher-risk tasks, such as banking transactions or sensitive decision-making, thereby enforcing clear capability boundaries as safety mechanism (OpenAI, 2025). Similarly, Anthropic restricts its computer use beta feature from creating accounts or generating content on social platforms to prevent human impersonation (Anthropic, 2025). Another critical challenge is user intent understanding. As noted by Kim et al. (2024b), GUI agents still struggle to accurately infer user goals across diverse applications, achieving only poor accuracy on unseen websites. Designing models that generalize effectively across varying tasks is crucial, particularly for handling contextual variations in user interactions and predicting user behavior in complex interfaces (Stefanidi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023). Recent research on Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) highlights how LLMs can simulate personas and dynamically adapt to user preferences, offering pathway to more personalized and context-aware GUI interactions (Chen et al., 2024b)."

(2024d) and Zhong et al. (2024), future systems need lightweight verification mechanisms that catch inconsistencies before they cause errors. Browser extensions could cross-verify agent actions against actual webpage structures, flagging discrepancies immediately. Interactive correction interfaces would allow users to adjust an agents visual attention during errors, creating valuable feedback loops to improve perception models. Additionally, environmental awareness systems could detect real-world distractions that might compromise reliability, addressing concerns raised by Ma et al. (2024). Adaptive Safety Architecture: Rather than applying uniform safety measures, agents should dynamically adjust protection levels based on context. When financial or medical interfaces are detected, content filters could automatically tighten, similar to the \"watch mode\" implemented in commercial systems (OpenAI, 2025). Modular safety components, like specialized verifiers for payment dialogs, could be plugged in as needed, extending the \"circuit breaker\" concept introduced by Zou et al. (2024). For critical operations, requiring physical confirmation (e.g., device authentication) could provide an additional security layer inspired by multi-agent verification (Yu et al., 2024). Learning from Failures: Perhaps most promising is the systematic improvement of agents through failure analysis. Community-driven reporting of rare errors could create diverse testing datasets beyond what developers anticipate. Automated post-failure analysis reports would help identify perception or reasoning gaps, extending approaches like those in Gunjal et al. (2023). By prioritizing fixes based on real-world impact rather than theoretical concerns, development resources could target the most critical reliability issues first."

Explainable Behavior Cloning (EBCLLMAgent) (Guan et al., 2024) captures demonstrations, generates executable code, and maps the code to UI elements. By documenting these transformations, the agent can clarify how it arrived at particular action. Similarly, hierarchical designs that separate high-level planning from low-level execution offer more interpretable structures (Liu et al., 2025a; Zhu et al., 2025; Agashe et al., 2024). Other efforts highlight introspection through multi-agent or chain-of-thought strategies (Nguyen et al., 2024c; Wang and Liu, 2024). Here, LLMbased agents iteratively reflect on previous reasoning steps, generating self-explanations or corrections. These reflective traces not only boost performance but also produce human-readable rationales. However, ensuring that explanations remain truthful rather than post-hoc justifications is still an open research challenge."

Providing users with comprehensible summaries, such as colorcoded or textual rationales, can help users trace the logic of agents (Houssel et al., 2024; Arnold and Tilton, 2024). Equally vital is the agents ability to justify or revise actions when confronted with unexpected outcomes. World models can enhance transparency by simulating multiple paths and explaining why certain actions seem preferable (Chae et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024a). While this can help build user trust, it also comes with added computational cost; therefore, designs need to strike balance to keep interactions responsive."

In contrast, enterprise software might generate justifications that align with domain-specific workflows and terminology (Srinivas et al., 2024). Beyond presentation, recent research explores how GUI agents can generate inherently interpretable outputs grounded in user-understandable concepts. For example, in vision-based tasks, synthesizing explanations with human-verifiable visual features has been shown to improve model reasoning and transparency, which could potentially enable GUI agents to justify actions in complex visual environments (Shi et al., 2025). On the language side, interpreting LLM representations using mutual information and sparse activations allows for controllable, semantically meaningful explanations, offering promising direction for more steerable and trustworthy GUI behaviors (Wu et al., 2025b).

            "content": "Enhancing explainability and transparency in GUI agents requires practical solutions that balance technical depth with user accessibility. Two promising directions emerge: Interactive Explanation Tools: Real-time visualization of agent reasoning could transform how users understand automated processes. Browser extensions could display decision chains (e.g., \"identify search box enter query select result\") using interactive flowcharts that visualize the agents current focus, building on techniques from EBCLLMAgent (Guan et al., 2024). On mobile devices, lightweight on-device models could highlight interface elements being analyzed without cloud processing delays, extending approaches from hierarchical agent designs (Liu et al., 2025a; Zhu et al., 2025). When operations fail, automated error playback could compare intended versus actual results, incorporating reflective techniques from XAgent (Nguyen et al., 2024c) to make troubleshooting intuitive. Context-Adaptive Explanations: Different users require different types of transparency. Future systems should provide role-based explanations, offering technical details for developers while generating simplified summaries for general users, extending the user-centric approaches seen in (Cuadra et al., 2024). Cultural context filters could automatically adjust explanation styles and privacy considerations based on regional norms, addressing localization challenges. Accessibility-focused explanation channels (such as voice explanations for visually impaired users) would ensure transparency benefits reach diverse populations, aligning with inclusive design principles (Xu et al., 2024b)."

Benchmarks like CASA measure assess how well agents navigate these cross-cultural settings without overstepping boundaries (Qiu et al., 2024).

The benchmarks are categorized into three dimensions: (1) security and privacy evaluation, focusing on vulnerability assessment and attack resistance; (2) harmfulness and reliability assessment, measuring agent compliance with safety protocols and failure modes; and (3) human and cultural alignment, evaluating agents ability to handle visual manipulations and conform to social norms. theoretical foundation, emphasizing the need for localization-focused approaches rather than relying on static cultural templates (Zhou et al., 2025). At the same time, agents also need to address accessibility, meeting the needs of older adults or individuals with sensory impairments (Cuadra et al., 2024). Designing flexible interaction paths, whether through speech, visual cues, or textual descriptions, will allow broader inclusivity. As technology advances, bridging cultural gaps and ensuring accessibility will likely require more elaborate training data and dedicated modules."

In regulated sectors such as healthcare or finance, compliance with data protection requirements becomes mandatory. Meanwhile, governments and institutions face difficulties in overseeing technologies that are rapidly evolving and often proprietary. Decentralized governance frameworks, such as those leveraging blockchain, have been proposed to enhance transparency, accountability, and decision rights in foundationmodel-based AI systems (Liu et al., 2023d)."

Modular systems make it easier to trace how different components handle data and interact, improving transparency and alignment with user inputs (Zhang et al., 2023; Hua et al., 2024). On the security side, newer authentication schemes aim to tighten control over delegation, making it harder for agents to take unauthorized actions while keeping the chain of responsibility clear (South et al., 2025). In real-world settings, developers must consider both the power and risks of autonomy. When agents handle critical tasks, such as financial transactions or medical record management, clear guidelines for fallback procedures and user oversight should be essential (Wright, 2024). Recent studies also highlight ethical concerns beyond security, such as how interactions with agents may inadvertently shape user beliefs, with evidence showing that LLM-powered conversational agents can significantly amplify false memories in sensitive contexts like witness interviews (Chan et al., 2024)."

However, success rate alone cannot capture trustworthiness. ST-WebAgentBench, for example, evaluates how well agents follow explicit policy rules, flagging any violations as signs of unsafe behavior (Levy et al., 2024). To detect problems earlier, intermediate metrics like URL or form field matching are also used to pinpoint where agents make mistakes (Zhou et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2022). Researchers also propose metrics for robustness under adversarial conditions (Wu et al., 2025a), cultural or social awareness (Qiu et al., 2024), and situational safety (Zhou et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023b). These approaches emphasize that reliable GUI agent must not only achieve the users intended outcome but also demonstrate safe and consistent behavior throughout the process."

GTArena partitions automated GUI testing into intent generation, test execution, and defect detection for mobile apps (Zhao et al., 2024). By capturing multiple facets, including correctness, error handling, and safety, such evaluations reveal more profound insights into agent behavior. Distinctions between closed-world and openworld tests matter for ecological validity. Closedlike curated sets of web world environments, pages, enable controlled experimentation but lack real-world unpredictability. Open-world evaluations allow dynamic changes and unknown interfaces (Chen et al., 2024c; He et al., 2024), forcing agents to adapt. Balancing reproducibility and realism remains an ongoing challenge."

MSSBench focuses on \"multimodal situational safety,\" where half of the query-image pairs require context-sensitive reasoning (Zhou et al., 2024). Similarly, VETL (Wang et al., 2024b) and WebCanvas (Koh et al., 2024a) test web GUI interactions and bug detection. These benchmarks illustrate that trustworthy evaluation is inherently multifaceted. Future work could unify the disparate tasks, data sources, and metrics into more holistic frameworks, enabling meaningful comparisons of agents safety, robustness, and usability. Such efforts will be critical for driving standardization and progress in this rapidly evolving domain."

Our analysis reveals significant challenges at the intersection of these dimensions, where multimodal interactions create novel attack surfaces and failure modes that traditional approaches cannot adequately address. While research has primarily focused on functional performance, the integrated nature of GUI agents demands holistic approaches to trustworthiness that span their entire operational pipeline. Looking forward, advancing trustworthy GUI agents will require: (1) robust multimodal defense mechanisms that protect against adversarial manipulations, (2) adaptive safety frameworks that balance autonomy with protection, and (3) usercentered transparency systems that make agent reasoning accessible without compromising security. Evaluation benchmarks should assess both capability and safety. With the right safeguards and cross-field collaboration, GUI agents can be made effective, secure, and aligned with human values."
