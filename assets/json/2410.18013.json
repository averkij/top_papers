            "content": "While text-to-image (T2I) models (Rombach et al., 2022; Podell et al., 2023; Betker et al., 2023; Esser et al., 2024) have become widespread recently, they still suffer from numerous shortcomings, including challenges with compositional generation (Lin et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024b), limited ability to render text (Liu et al., 2022a), and lacking of spatial understanding (Chatterjee et al., 2024). There have been several attempts at addressing these issues with larger models (Esser et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024), improved datasets (Schuhmann et al., 2022; Gadre et al., 2023), and superior language conditioning (Chen et al., 2024b; Pernias et al., 2024). However, these approaches typically involve training larger models from scratch and are not applicable to existing models. On the other hand, drawing inspiration from Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning T2I models with human feedback has become an important and practical topic to enhance existing T2I models (Liu et al., 2024a). There are two major efforts in this area, namely, 1) collecting large amounts of user preferences images for training (Lee et al., 2023b; Dai et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024a) and 2) fine-tuning with T2I models with reward functions (Wu et al., 2023b;a; Xu et al., 2023; Kirstain et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a). The former direction shows promising results when utilizing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), which was first proposed for aligning LLMs with human feedback, to improve the denoising of the more preferred images as compared to the denoising of the less preferred images (Wallace et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c; Hong et al., 2024b; Liang et al., 2024b). Nevertheless, the existing process for data collection is expensive and the datasets can be outdated quickly, e.g., Pick-a-Picv2 (Kirstain et al., 2023) costs nearly $50K (Otani et al., 2023) for collecting 5122px generated images, while most recent T2I models generate 10242px images. The later direction fine-tunes the T2I models by maximizing the reward functions with the generated images (Black et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024a; Clark et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023; Prabhudesai et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024d). However, this process is computationally expensive due to the backpropagation through the diffusion process. Additionally, these methods suffer from reward hacking, where this optimization process increases the reward scores without improving the quality of the generated images. In this work, we address the above challenges and propose scalable and cost-effective solution for aligning T2I models. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using synthetically labeled preferences in fine-tuning T2I models with DPO-based techniques. While this has been studied in depth in the context of LLMs (Lee et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2022b), there have been only preliminary explorations in the context of T2I models (Wallace et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024c). To this end, we introduce the following two novel contributions: Synthetically Labeled Preference Dataset (Syn-Pic). We generate images from different T2I models and label them with multiple pre-trained reward models that can estimate human preference. Therefore, no manual annotation is involved in data collection, making the data collection cost-effective and easily scalable. By aggregating scores from multiple reward models, we mitigate reward over-optimization (Coste et al., 2024; Eyring et al., 2024). Unlike the conventional pairwise comparisons, we construct ranking of the generated images for each prompt. While aggregating preferences across multiple human labelers and constructing rankings are possible, these dramatically increase the annotation cost compared to the minimal overhead in our case. Ranking-based Preference Optimization (RankDPO). To leverage the benefits of the richer signal from the rankings, we introduce ranking-enhanced DPO objective, RankDPO, borrowing from the extensive literature on learning-to-rank (Burges et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013; 2018;"

We conduct extensive evaluation to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed contributions: First, using the same prompts as Pick-a-Picv2 leads to dramatic improvements for the SDXL and SD3-Medium models. We show the improved results on various benchmark datasets, including GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023) (Tab. 1), T2I-Compbench (Huang et al., 2023) (Tab. 2), and DPGBench (Hu et al., 2024) (Tab. 3), as well as, the visual comparisons (examples in Fig. 1) through user studies  (Fig. 3)  . Second, we achieve the state-of-the-art results compared to the existing methods on preference optimization, e.g., Tab. 3. More importantly, such results are obtained by only requiring 3 fewer images than Pick-a-Picv2, i.e., Tab. 8. Third, even though SD3-Medium (2B parameters) has already been optimized with 3M human preferences through DPO, we are still able to further get significant improvements with our Syn-Pic dataset of 240K images, e.g., Tabs. 1,2,3."

            "content": "Text-to-Image Models. Early works employing GANs for text-to-image synthesis (Reed et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) evolved more recently around diffusion (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) and rectified flow (Liu et al., 2022b; Lipman et al., 2023; Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023) models for image and video generation. Following the success of the Stable Diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022; Podell et al., 2023), several improvements have been proposed, including the use of superior U-Net/transformer backbones (Peebles & Xie, 2023; Bao et al., 2023), stronger language conditioning through superior text encoders (Raffel et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2024c;b) and improved captions Betker et al. (2023); Esser et al. (2024); Chatterjee et al. (2024). In this work, we explore the efficacy of synthetically generated preferences to enhance pre-trained text-to-image model using methods based on learning from human/AI feedback. Learning from Human Preferences. In LLMs, alignment with human preferences (Griffith et al., 2013; Christiano et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022a) has been crucial in developing chatbots and language assistants. The paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involved collecting large amounts of user preferences for various prompt output pairs. Following this, reward models were trained to mimic user preferences, after which reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), REINFORCE (Williams, 1992; Ahmadian et al., 2024)) were used to optimize language models to maximize reward model scores. However, Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023) along with similar variants (Azar et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2024a; Meng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024c) emerged as strong alternative, introducing an equivalent mathematical formulation that enabled training language models directly on user preferences without requiring reward models or reinforcement learning. These insights have since been used more generally in image/video generation (Wallace et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c). In contrast, we demonstrate the superior efficacy of improving text-to-image models purely from AI feedback, similar to the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (Lee et al., 2023a) in LLMs. Preference-Tuning of Image Models. Reward models have been used effectively to fine-tune image generation models using either reinforcement learning (Black et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024a) or reward backpropogation (Lee et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024d; Prabhudesai et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Clark et al., 2024; Prabhudesai et al., 2024; Domingo-Enrich et al., 2024; Jena et al., 2024). However, this process is computationally expensive and requires additional memory due to backpropagation through the sampling process. Further, it has not yet been successfully applied on larger models at 10242px resolution. As result, following language modeling literature, DPO techniques have also been adapted to image generation (Wallace et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c; Liang et al., 2024b; Hong et al., 2024b; Gu et al., 2024), thereby avoiding the expensive training objective. There have also been several methods specifically tailored to improve prompt following in specialized settings (Li et al., 2024b; Hu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023; Liao et al., 2024). Differently, we demonstrate the possibility of using reward model feedback through the denoising/preference optimization objective as more general and effective solution than existing approaches for aligning text-to-image models."

            "content": "In this section, we first provide an overview of diffusion models for text-to-image generation and direct preference optimization for these models. Next, we discuss the process of curating and labeling scalable preference optimization dataset. Finally, we describe our ranking enabled preference optimization method, called RankDPO, to leverage this ranked preference dataset. We describe these two components with illustration in Fig. 2. We provide pseudo-code to train RankDPO on Syn-Pic in Algorithm 3 in Appendix A.6. Notation. We use the symbol pdata to denote the real data drawn from the distribution pdata. In our setup, diffusion process transforms the real image to Gaussian noise Ïµ (0, I) with predefined signal-noise schedule {Î±t, Ït}T t=1. The diffusion model reverses this process by learning denoiser ËÏµÎ¸, neural network parameterized by Î¸ to estimate the conditional distribution pÎ¸(xc), where is the conditioning signal that guides the generation towards the condition. For text-toimage models, we use as the embedding corresponding to the text-prompt. For brevity, we interchangeably use the symbol to mean both the text-prompt/embedding. Diffusion Models. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) learn to predict real data pdata by reversing the ODE flow. Specifically, with pre-defined signal-noise schedule {Î±t, Ït}T t=1, it samples noise Ïµ (0, I), and constructs noisy sample xt at time as xt = Î±tx + ÏtÏµ. The denoising model ÏµÎ¸ parameterized by Î¸ is trained with the objective as: Et[1,T ],ÏµN (0,I)Ïµ ÏµÎ¸(xt, c)2, min Î¸ (1) where is the total number of steps, and is the condition signal. 3.1 DPO FOR DIFFUSION MODELS The Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley & Terry, 1952) defines pairwise preferences with the following formulation: pBT(xw xlc) = Ï(r(c, xw) r(c, xl)), where Ï() is the sigmoid function, xw is the more preferred image, xl is the less preferred image, and r(c, x) is the reward model that computes alignment score between condition and image x. (2) From this, Rafailov et al. (2023) demonstrate that the following objective is equivalent to the process of explicit reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO/REINFORCE) with the reward model r: LDPO(Î¸) = c,xw ,xl (cid:20) (cid:18) log Ï Î² log pÎ¸(xwc) pref(xwc) Î² log pÎ¸(xlc) pref(xlc) (cid:19)(cid:21) , (3) where pref(xc) is the base reference distribution, and Î² controls the distributional deviation. However, in the context of diffusion models, it is not feasible to compute the likelihood of an image (i.e., p(xc)). Therefore, Wallace et al. (2024) propose tractable alternative which they prove is equivalent up to minor relaxation of the original DPO objective. Given sample (c, xw, xl), denoising and reference models (ÏµÎ¸, Ïµref), we define score function as s(x, c, t, Î¸) = Ïµ ÏµÎ¸(x , c)2 2 Ïµ Ïµref(x , c)2 2, where updated DPO objective can be defined as follows: = Î±tx + ÏtÏµ, Ïµ (0, I) is noisy latent for input at time t. With this, the L(Î¸) = (c,xw ,xl)D, t[0,T ] log Ï (cid:16) Î² (cid:16) s(xw, c, t, Î¸) s(xl, c, t, Î¸) (cid:17)(cid:17) . (4) In practice, we randomly sample timestep (t) and compute the denoising objective at this timestep for both the winning (xw t) sample for both the trainable and the reference models. The DPO objective ensures that for given conditioning signal c, the denosing improves for the winning sample, along with worsening the denoising for the losing sample. This biases the model towards generating images more similar to the preferred images for the condition c. ) and the losing (xl"

            "content": "Figure 2: Overview of our two novel components: (A) Syn-Pic and (B) RankDPO. Left illustrates the pipeline to generate synthetically ranked preference dataset. It starts by collecting prompts and generating images using the same prompt for different T2I models. Next, we calculate the overall preference score using Reward models (e.g., PickScore, ImageReward). Finally, we rank these images in the decreasing order of preference scores. Right: Given true preference rankings for generated images per prompt, we first obtain predicted ranking by current model checkpoint using scores si (see Eq. 5). In this instance, although the predicted ranking is inverse of the true rankings, the ranks (1, 4) obtains larger penalty than the ranks (2, 3). This penalty is added to our ranking loss through DCG weights (see Eq. 6). Thus, by optimizing Î¸ with Ranking Loss (see Eq. 7), the updated model addresses the incorrect rankings (1, 4). This procedure is repeated over the training process, where the rankings induced by the model aligns with the labelled preferences. 3.2 SYNTHETICALLY LABELED PREFERENCE DATASET (SY N-PI C) In this section, we describe an efficient and scalable method to collect preference dataset used in the DPO objective (Eq. 4). Given list of text-prompts {ci}N i=1, consists of paired preferences which denote winning and losing images, i.e., {ci, xw i=1. Pick-a-Picv2 (Kirstain et al., 2023) is an example of preference dataset used in earlier works, consisting of nearly 58K prompts and 0.85M preference pairs. Traditionally, the data collection process involves human annotations of images generated by text-to-image models, which is expensive due to human labeling costs. Further, these hand-curated datasets become outdated quickly due to improvements in text-to-image models. , xl i}N We collect new preference dataset by generating images from various state-of-the-art T2I models (e.g., SD3-Medium (Esser et al., 2024), StableCascade (Pernias et al., 2024), Pixart-Î£ (Chen et al., 2024b), and SDXL (Podell et al., 2023)) for the same prompts as the Pick-a-Picv2 dataset. Further, we eliminate the human annotation cost by labeling these samples using existing off-the-shelf human-preference models, e.g., HPSv2.1 (Wu et al., 2023a). However, different reward models may have complementary strengths (e.g., some focus more on visual quality, others are better at textimage alignment, etc.). Therefore, we propose to aggregate the preferences from 5 different models, including HPSv2.1 (Wu et al., 2023a), MPS (Zhang et al., 2024a), PickScore (Kirstain et al., 2023), VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024), and ImageReward (Xu et al., 2023). For each prompt and image xk , we compute the probability of the an image being preferred over other images over all rewards. by aggregating the total number of wins compared to the total number of comparisons for xk . This score Ï(xk ) is used to rank the generated images in the decreasing order of aggregate scores, resulting in target preference ranking, and is also used for the gain function in Sec. 3.3. Thus, for T2I models, we obtain = {ci, x1 , Ï(x1 i=1, fully synthetically ranked preference dataset. We describe it in detailed procedure in Algorithm 1 in Appendix A.6. ), . . . , Ï(xk , . . . , xk ), Ï(x2 )}N , x2 Discussion. Our data collection method has several benefits as highlighted below. Cost Efficiency. We can generate arbitrarily large preference dataset, since there is no human in the annotation loop, both image-generation and labelling is done using off-the-shelf models, reducing the dataset curation cost. For instance, it requires $50K to collect Pick-a-Picv2 (Kirstain et al., 2023) dataset, in contrast, we can collect similar scale dataset with $200."

            "title": "3.3 RANKING-BASED PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (RA N KDPO)",
            "content": "Unlike the DPO objective which focuses on pairwise preferences, our synthetic dataset generates multiple images per prompt, resulting in ranked preference dataset. Therefore, we would like to optimize the many-way preference at once instead of purely relying on pairwise preferences. Specifically, given text-prompt c, and generated images in ranked order of preference {x1, x2, . . . , xk}, we want to ensure that the denoising for image xi is better than xj for all > j. To enforce this, we draw inspiration from the Learning to Rank (LTR) literature, and re-purpose the LambdaLoss (Wang et al., 2018) by adding the DCG weights to each sample, similar to Liu et al. (2024c) as follows: Given sample (c, {xi}k i=1), denoising, reference models (ÏµÎ¸, Ïµref), we define score as t, c)2 (5) = Î±txi + ÏtÏµi, Ïµi (0, I) is noisy latent for input xi at time t. This score measures where xi how much better or worse the model prediction is compared to the reference model for the given condition c. si s(xi, c, t, Î¸) = Ïµi ÏµÎ¸(xi 2 Ïµi Ïµref(xi i=1, {Ï(i)}k t, c)2 2, After computing the scores si, the images are ranked from the most preferred (lowest si) to the least preferred (highest si). This is the predicted rank for {xi}k i=1 using model Î¸. We use the ground truth scores Ï(i) to obtain the true preference ranking Ï (). The rank of each image xi is denoted by Ï (i), where Ï (i) = 1 for the best image, Ï (i) = 2 for the second best, and so on. The gain for each sample Ï(i) is the average probability that sample is preferred over all other samples according to human preference reward model scoring. Using Ï (i) and Ï(i), we define the gain function Gi and the discount function D(Ï (i)) as: Gi = 2Ï(i) 1; D(Ï (i)) = log(1 + Ï (i)). The discount function decreases as the rank Ï (i) increases, ensuring that higher-ranked images (those with lower Ï (i)) have greater influence on the final loss. The logarithmic form of the discount function smooths out the penalty differences between consecutive ranks, making the model more robust to small ranking errors, especially for lower-ranked images. We define the weight between two image pairs (xi, xj) as i,j = Gi Gj (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) 1 D(Ï (i)) 1 D(Ï (j)) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) . (6) Finally, putting all these together, the RankDPO loss is then formulated as: LRankDPO(Î¸) = (c,x1,x2,...,xk)D, t[0,T ] i,j log Ï (cid:16) Î² (cid:16) s(xi, c, t, Î¸) s(xj, c, t, Î¸) (cid:35) (cid:17)(cid:17) , (7) (cid:34) (cid:88) i>j where Ï() is the sigmoid function and Î² controls the strength of the KL regularization. We describe the training process in detailed procedure in Algorithm 2 in Appendix A.6. This loss function encourages the model to produce images that not only satisfy pairwise preferences, but also respect the overall ranking of images generated for the same prompt. By weighting the traditional DPO objective with gains and discounts derived from the ranking, we ensure that the model prioritizes the generation of higher-quality images according to the ranking, leading to more consistent improvements in both aesthetics and prompt alignment."

In Tab. 1, we report results on GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023). RankDPO consistently improves the performance on almost every category, leading to an averaged performance gain from 0.55 to 0.61 for SDXL and from 0.70 to 0.74 for SD3-Medium. In particular, we observe large improvements on two objects, counting and color attribution, where there are gains of nearly 10%.We observe similar trend on T2I-Compbench (Huang et al., 2023) in Tab. 2, where SDXL gains by over 10% on Color and Texture and achieves improvements in other categories. Long Prompts. In Tab. 3, we further evaluate models for visual quality and prompt alignment on DPG-Bench (Hu et al., 2024), which consists of long and detailed prompts. To measure prompt alignment, we employ both the original DSG metric (Cho et al., 2024) and VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024), while for visual quality, we use the Q-Align model (Wu et al., 2024a). We notice that Diffusion-DPO (denoted as DPO-SDXL) (Wallace et al., 2024) trained on Pick-a-Picv2 is able to provide meaningful improvements on prompt alignment, while fine-tuning SDXL with MaPO (Hong et al., 2024b) and SPO (Liang et al., 2024b) (denoted as MaPO-SDXL and SPO-SDXL) improves visual quality. However, RankDPO, despite being trained only on synthetic preferences, improves all metrics by significant amounts (e.g., 74.51 to 79.26 on DSG score and 0.72 to 0.81 on Q-Align score for SDXL) and achieves the state-of-the-art prompt alignment metrics. For SD3-Medium, we continue to see improved model performance after fine-tuning with our proposed RankDPO. User Study. To further validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform user study on 450 prompts from DPGbench. We ask users to choose the better image based on their overall preference, i.e., combining text-image alignment and visual quality. Fig. 3 shows that RankDPO has superior winrate compared to both DPO-SDXL (Wallace et al., 2024) and SDXL (Podell et al., 2023), indicating the efficacy in enhancing the overall quality of the generated images. Qualitative Examples for prompts from DPG-Bench (Hu et al., 2024) are presented in Fig. 4. Compared to the base SDXL and other preference-tuned models, RankDPO provides superior prompt following.

Discussion of Computation Cost. We require 10 A100 GPU days to generate images and label the preferences, which is one-time cost. Running RankDPO for 400 steps on the generated data takes about 6 GPU days for SDXL at 10242px. In contrast, existing reward optimization methods (Li et al., 2024d; Zhang et al., 2024b) take 64-95 A100 GPU days with the smaller SD1.5 model at 5122px. Similarly, compared to Diffusion-DPO (Wallace et al., 2024), RankDPO trains on onethird of the data while avoiding manually curated preferences. There are also methods enhancing text-to-image models by using text encoders such as T5/LLaMA models (Hu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), which require 10M to 34M densely captioned images and train for 50-120 A100 GPU days. 4.2 ABLATION ANALYSIS Effect of Data and Labelling Function. Since generating the preferences is crucial aspect of RankDPO, we evaluate different labelling choices in Tab. 4. We experiment with random labelling where preferences are randomly chosen and apply DPO. This is able to only provide minimal improvements in performance (74.65 to 75.66 DSG score). We also show the results with pairwise preferences from single reward model (HPSv2.1) and averaging preferences from 5 models. While HPSv2.1 provides good improvements for both prompt alignment and visual quality, ensembling the predictions across multiple models improves the results further. We also note that these results outperform DPO applied on Pick-a-Picv2, highlighting the importance of the image quality while constructing preference datasets. Finally, we investigate the impact of the different models used to construct Syn-Pic. This is done by constructing similar dataset with SDXL images by only varying the seed. While we nearly get the same improvements in prompt alignment, we only see small improvement in visual quality. This indicates that synthetic preference-tuning can be applied to any model on its outputs, however, having images from different models can further improve results. Analysis of Learning Objective. critical aspect of preference optimization is the choice of learning objectives and we perform various experiments in Tab. 4 to compare them. Besides the regular DPO formulation, several works show the benefits of supervised fine-tuning on curated high-quality data (Dai et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024a), which also we take into the comparisons. The baseline includes the following: Supervised Fine-Tuning that subselects the winning image from each pairwise comparison and fine-tunes SDXL on this subset. Weighted Fine-Tuning that fine-tunes SDXL on all the samples, but assigns weight to each sample based on the HPSv2.1 scores (Wu et al., 2023a), similar to Lee et al. (2023b)."

            "content": "In this work, we introduce powerful and cost-effective recipe for the preference optimization of text-to-image models. In particular, we demonstrate how synthetically generating preference optimization dataset can enable the collection of superior signals (e.g., rankings vs. pairwise preferences and ensembling preferences across models). We also introduce simple method to leverage the stronger signals, leading to state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks for prompt following and visual quality for both the diffusion and rectified flow models. We hope our work paves the way for future work on scaling effective post-training solutions for text-to-image models. Limitations. We rely solely on the prompts from Pick-a-Picv2 (Kirstain et al., 2023) for constructing our preference dataset. While this allows us to fairly compare to prior work on preference optimization, our dataset is limited by the quantity and diversity of the prompts in Pick-a-Picv2. Expanding the prompts to include different use cases would significantly enhance the utility of the dataset and improve the quality of the downstream models. Additionally, we focus only on text-image alignment and visual quality. However, preference optimization is also well-suited to improving the safety of the text-to-image models, which can also be investigated in future work."

            "content": "A.1 COMPARISON TO OTHER METHODS We also investigate methods like ELLA (Hu et al., 2024) which replace the CLIP text encoder in SDXL with LLM based text-encoder (e.g., T5-XL) and use an adapter (470M params in the case of ELLA) to project these features to the original feature space. While both ELLA and RankDPO achieve similar performance on T2I-Compbench and DPG-bench as in Tab. 6, we must note that ELLA takes 18 the training time and over 100 images. Moreover, this imposes the additional cost of including the T5/LLaMa model and using the timestep based adapter (470M params) at every timestep, leading to increased inference time. We also compare ELLA and other preference optimization methods in Tab. 7. We see that RankDPO trained on Syn-Pic provides the best trade-off in terms of training data requirements, computational resources (training time) and downstream performance (as measured with the DPG-bench score). Finally, we do not have comparisons against methods that perform reward fine-tuning, since they need 100 A100 days to be applied at large-scale for the smaller SD1.5 model at 512 resolution and have not been applied sucessfully to the larger SDXL model at 1024 resolution or show minimal benefits in enhancing text-image alignment (Jena et al., 2024).

A.3 DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EVALUATIONS T2I-Compbench consists of 6000 compositional prompts from 6 different categories (color, shape, texture, spatial, non-spatial, complex). The evaluation for these prompts are done using combination of VQA models, object detectors and vision-language model scores (e.g., CLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021)). GenEval consists of 553 prompts comprising different challenges (single object, two objects, counting, position, color, color attribution). These are mostly evaluated using object detectors. DPG-Bench aggregates prompts from several sources, and lengthens them using LLMs. These prompts on average have 67 words making it extremely challenging for prompt following. The"

            "content": "generated images are mostly evaluated using VQA models under the Davidsonian Scene Graph (Cho et al., 2024) framework. We use the following evaluation metrics for different benchmarks: GeneEval. The evaluation for GenEval is performed using the Maskformer (Cheng et al., 2021) object detection models. This is used to determine if the image contains objects specified in the prompts. For color, CLIP model is used to identify the color of the objects. T2I-CompBench: Attribute Binding uses BLIP-VQA model (Li et al., 2022b) to ask different (upto 8) questions about the generated images, and is used to validate if the answered questions match the details specified in the prompt. T2I-CompBench: Spatial uses Unidet (Zhou et al., 2022) model to perform object detection to see if the objects in the generated images follow the spatial orientation specified in the prompt. T2I-CompBench: Non-Spatial computes the CLIPScore for the prompt and the generated image. T2I-CompBench: Complex averages the score computed from Attribute Binding, Spatial, and Complex. DPG-Bench: DSG uses the Davidsonian Scene Graph (Cho et al., 2024) to compute question answer pairs and use VQA model (mPLUG) (Li et al., 2022a) to answer the questions before computing the percentage of questions correctly answered. DPG-Bench: VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) trains multimodal LLM with CLIP encoder and Flan-T5 decoder to predict the likelihood of the prompt being appropriate for the image. DPG-Bench: Q-Align Aesthetic Score (Wu et al., 2024a) finetunes multimodal LLM (e.g., LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023) to predict the aesthetic score of an image from scale of 0 to 1. A.4 COST ANALYSIS. We provide the estimates for the cost of labeling Pick-a-Picv2 as compared to Syn-Pic in Tab. 8. Even excluding the cost of generating 2M images, labeling 1M pairwise preferences becomes expensive when following standard guidelines of Otani et al. (2023) and paying $0.05 per comparison. However, in contrast, Syn-Pic costs < $20 for labeling preferences using five different reward models, since each of them need only few hours on single GPU to label the preferences. We also note that using an LLM like GPT-4o to generate the comparisons would take over $450 to just process all the images from Syn-Pic. Here, the bigger cost is in generating 4 images for the 58K prompts from Pick-a-Picv2, which can still be completed in < $200. Table 8: Cost comparison of generating and labelling Pick-a-Picv2 vs. Syn-Pic Item Pick-a-Picv2 Syn-Pic Number of prompts Number of images Number of preferences Image generation cost Annotation/Labelling cost 58 000 1 025 015 959 000 N/A $47 950.00 58 000 232 000 N/A $185.60 < $20. Total cost $47 950.00 < $205.60 A.5 ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES We provide further qualitative comparisons against SDXL  (Fig. 6)  and other preference optimization methods  (Fig. 5)  from prompts of DPG-Bench. We see improved prompt following: specifically objects mentioned in the prompt which can easily be missed by SDXL are captured by our model. Further, we also see improved modeling on finer details and relations in the generated images. We also provide an example for SD3-Medium in Fig. 7. In addition to the trends observed before, we observe examples where we are able to fix some deformities in the generations of SD3-Medium."

Although we provide method overview in Fig. 2, for completion we also present the detailed workings of these two components in procedural manner. Algorithm 1 describes the data collection process given the set of prompts, T2I models, and human preference reward models. Algorithm 2 describes the pseudo code to train diffusion model using RankDPO. It takes as input the ranked preference dataset (Syn-Pic), reference model Î¸ref, initial model Î¸init, and other hyper-parameters that control the training and noise-signal schedule in the diffusion process. Finally, Algorithm 3 combines these two procedures to describe our end-to-end data generation and training process.
