            "content": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has become increasingly important in making digital services accessible across languages and modalities (Baevski et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2022). While recent transformer-based architectures have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, many of the worlds languages still lack sufficient transcribed speech for training robust ASR models (Pratap et al., 2020a; Babu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024). This data scarcity creates significant barrier to developing effective multilingual speech *Work done during internship at ByteDance Corresponding author 1 technologies, particularly affecting communities where manual data collection is resource-intensive or logistically challenging (Costa-jussÃ  et al., 2022; Communication et al., 2023; Pratap et al., 2023). natural way to mitigate the data scarcity issue is to leverage high-quality generative models. Recent work has demonstrated successful applications of these models for data augmentation in computer vision (Fan et al., 2023; Azizi et al., 2023), natural language processing (Gunasekar et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024), and speech recognition (Yang et al., 2024). Despite their demonstrated potential, the role of generative models in overcoming data scarcity presents paradox. These models themselves typically demand vast amounts of labeled data to attain their remarkable capabilities. For instance, Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), leading text-to-image model frequently used for data augmentation (Tian et al., 2023; Trabucco et al., 2023), was trained on millions of labeled images. This reliance prompts fundamental question: do synthetic data truly alleviate data scarcity in downstream tasks, or do they simply shift the burden of data collection to the pre-training stage of generative models? Our work investigates whether an off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) model can be trained with limited real transcribed speech datajust tens of hoursto generate synthetic data that enhances multilingual ASR models. To address this challenge, we propose Speech Back-Translation (see Figure 1), scalable method that build largescale synthetic transcribed speech from text corpora with TTS models. Our results demonstrate that synthetic data, generated by TTS models trained on just tens of hours of labeled audio, can effectively expand small human-labeled datasets to tens of thousands of hours. To assess the quality of this back-translated synthetic dataset, we propose novel intelligibility-based metric and use it to establish thresholds indicating when Figure 1: Pipeline of Speech Back-Translation. The main objective is to augment limited training data (100 hours) for low-resource languages by synthesizing extensive amounts of speech (>10,000 hours). Starting from multilingual TTS model pre-trained with high-resource languages, we fine-tune it on small set of seed data, then generate synthetic speech by conditioning the fine-tuned model on large textual corpus and diverse audio prompts. synthetic speech reliably enhances ASR performance. Finally, we scale Speech Back-Translation to 500K hours across ten languages and continue pre-training Whisper-large-v31, one of the stateof-the-art multilingual ASR models. As result, we observe consistent improvements across all languages, achieving an average reduction of over 30% in transcription error rates. To summarize, our main contributions are listed as follows: 1. We demonstrate that just tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to generate tens of thousands of highquality synthetic speech, achieving scaling factor of several hundred. 2. We introduce an intelligibility-based evaluation framework for synthetic speech and establish thresholds to determine when synthetic data reliably benefits ASR performance. 3. We build the largest synthetic speech dataset to date500K hours spanning ten languagesand use it to further pre-train Whisper-large-v3. This yields an average 30% reduction on transcription error rates, highlighting the scalability of our approach."

            "content": "2.1 Back-Translation Back-translation is data augmentation technique originally used in machine translation to expand training data (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Edunov et al., 2018). In typical setup, model trained to translate from the target language back into the source language (i.e., reverse model) is used to generate synthetic source sentences from real targetlanguage data. These newly created source-target 1https://hf.co/openai/whisper-large-v3 pairs can then be used to train forward translation model, effectively increasing its exposure to broader range of textual content. For speech recognition, back-translation offers mechanism to supplement scarce or imbalanced datasets by leveraging an abundance of target-side text. Here, the reverse model is typically text-to-speech model that generates synthetic speech from textual corpora. Integrating this synthetic speech with existing training data allows the model to handle wider range of speech variability, enhancing recognition performance despite resource constraints. 2.2 Zero-shot Text-to-Speech Model Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) models (Wang et al., 2023; Casanova et al., 2024) represent milestone in speech synthesis, enabling the generation of high-quality speech for previously unseen speakers without additional fine-tuning. These models typically contain the following components: Audio Tokenizer: Encodes raw acoustic inputs (e.g., mel-spectrograms) into discrete audio tokens, forming the basis for synthesis. Speaker Embeddings: Contain speaker-specific acoustic features, which are normally extracted from audio clips, enabling zero-shot adaptation to new voices. Decoder-only Transformer: Processes speaker embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate sequences of audio tokens. The Transformer model is trained in an auto-regressive manner. Vocoder: Converts the generated audio tokens into waveform audio, producing the final synthesized output. The synergy of these components allows zero-shot TTS models to generalize effectively to speakers not encountered during training, maintaining high voice similarity and naturalness."

            "title": "3 Approach: Speech Back-Translation",
            "content": "In this section, we introduce the proposed Speech Back-Translation (see Figure 1). we first detail how we extend existing TTS models to support new lowresource languages with fine-tuning (Section 3.1). We then describe how we generate large-scale synthetic speech dataset (Section 3.2). 3.1 Fine-tuning with Low-resource Languages Obtaining high-quality transcribed speech for lowresource languages poses significant challenge for multilingual ASR training. To address this, we extend existing multilingual TTS modelsoriginally trained on high-resource languagesto new, lowresource languages via targeted fine-tuning with limited data. Vocabulary Expansion Before fine-tuning, we expand the vocabulary of pre-trained TTS models to accommodate words not encountered during the initial training phase. We employ the Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm (Sennrich et al., 2016b) on textual data from the target language, appending the newly derived subwords to the models original vocabulary. This approach preserves the integrity of the existing vocabulary while enabling effective representation of new linguistic units. Limited Data Fine-tuning Given the scarcity of transcribed speech data, we adopt conservative fine-tuning strategy: we freeze modules responsible for low-level acoustic representations, such as the audio tokenizer and vocoder, while selectively fine-tuning only the transformer part of the TTS model. This ensures stability in fundamental acoustic modeling while effectively adapting linguistic and prosodic mappings to the target language. During fine-tuning, each pair of audio and transcript data is processed by first extracting speaker embedding from the audio clip. Then, we tokenize both the transcript and audio clip, concatenating the text tokens = [x1, . . . , xS] and audio tokens = [y1, . . . , yT ] into = [z1, . . . , zS+T ]. The training objective minimizes the negative loglikelihood of sequence conditioned on the speaker embedding e: = S+T (cid:88) t=1 log p(cid:0)zt z1, . . . , zt1, e(cid:1), (1) Quality Estimation Evaluating the performance of fine-tuned models is essential before deploying them for large-scale synthetic data generation. Intelligibilitycommonly measured as the Word Error Rate (WER) using robust ASR systemhas emerged as the standard metric for assessing synthetic speech quality (Wang et al., 2023; Casanova et al., 2024). Yet this conventional method has two drawbacks: (1) the judge ASR introduces its own errors, particularly in low-resource languages; and (2) absolute WER values are not comparable across languages. To alleviate these issues, we propose novel metric called Normalized Intelligibility, leveraging ASR performance on natural speech as reference baseline. We use the Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022), which provides high-quality audio-transcript pairs across 102 languages, and Whisper-large-v3 as our judge ASR system. By synthesizing speech using transcripts from Fleurs, we measure two WER scores for each language: WER on synthetic speech (WERs) and WER on real speech (WERr). Normalized Intelligibility (Norm_I) is defined as: Norm_I = exp (cid:18) WERr WERs WERr (cid:19) (2) This formulation offers several advantages: (1) it normalizes ASR performance across languages using real speech as baseline, (2) it enables meaningful cross-language comparisons, and (3) it produces intuitive scores bounded between 0 and e, where higher values reflect better synthetic speech quality relative to natural speech. 3.2 Generating Large-scale Synthetic Speech Zero-shot TTS converts text into audio by conditioning on two indispensable inputs: (i) an audio prompt that specifies the target voice style and (ii) text sentence that supplies the textual content. Both inputs must therefore be covered at scale and with maximal diversity. Audio Prompts: We curate around 1 million short audio clips spanning diverse speakers and recording conditions. After strict de-duplication to remove near-identical voices, every retained clip can serve as style prompt that the TTS model imitates. Details of data sources and filtering are provided in Appendix C. Text Corpus: To maximize linguistic variety, we sample sentences across various domains, following the data-mixing practices of recent open-source LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2023).

The Real-only rows indicate models trained only on tens of hours of real audio, while the Speech BT rows present performance achieved when expanding training data to 10K hours using our method. 4.3 Languages Our experiments span ten languages across diverse language families and resource levels. Following Whispers training data distribution, we categorize them based on the relative resource availability: High (10K hours): English (en), Chinese (zh), French (fr), German (de), Spanish (es) Mid (1K10K hours): Dutch (nl), Italian (it) Low (1K hours): Vietnamese (vi), Czech (cs), Hungarian (hu) Of these languages, XTTS supports all except Vietnamese. To enable Vietnamese support, we finetune XTTS with 100 hours of transcribed speech sampled from viVoice2, high-quality dataset derived from YouTube. 4.4 Datasets Most of our experiments use Common Voice data (Ardila et al., 2019), chosen for its high quality and broad language coverage, and it also serves as the primary training corpus for XTTS. To assess generalization, we additionally evaluate our ASR models on Voxpopuli (Wang et al., 2021) and Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b)."

Batch Inference: We group multiple sentences with similar lengths using single audio prompt, then apply tailored attention masks to enable simultaneous generation of multiple utterances in one forward pass. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques using XTTS (Casanova et al., 2024) on single NVIDIA V100 GPU.

Table 1 compares these Real-only models against models enhanced with our Speech BT method for both Whispermedium and Whisper-large. Consistently across all three languages, Speech BT provides substantial gains in WER, underscoring the effectiveness of augmenting limited real speech with large-scale synthetic data. 5.2 Multilingual Performance and Out-of-Domain Generalization To evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in multilingual setting, we generated 160,000 hours of synthetic speech spanning seven languages at varying resource levels: French, German, and Spanish (high-resource); Dutch and Italian (mid-resource); Czech and Hungarian (lowresource). As baseline, we also collected 3,800 hours of transcribed speech from Common Voice as the training data. Figure 3 compares our synthetic dataset with the original Whisper Dataset and Common Voice. Our synthetic dataset provides substantially more training hours than the original Whisper dataset for each language: 3fold increase for high-resource languages, 10-fold increase for mid-resource languages, and 40-fold increase for low-resource languages. While both Whisper training data and Common Voice exhibit substantial resource imbalance across languages (with high-resource languages having significantly more data than mid and low-resource ones), our Speech BT dataset maintains more uniform distribution. This balanced allocation across language resources enables more equitable training, addressing key limitation of naturally collected datasets. 3Training data for vi comes from viVoice, whereas data for cs and hu are sampled from Common Voice. Figure 3: Comparison of dataset sizes across seven languages (log-scale y-axis). Languages are categorized by resource availability in the Whisper dataset: (a) high-resource, (b) mid and low-resource groups. we analyze the relationship between TTS quality and ASR performance using our fine-tuned TTS model (Section 5.3), and explore strategies for optimally leveraging limited in-domain real data (Section 5.4). Finally, we scale the synthetic corpus to 500K hours and compare our results with prior work (Section 5.5). 5.1 From Tens of Hours to Tens of Thousands We first assess the effectiveness of our approach by expanding the amount of training data for three low-resource languagesVietnamese (vi), Czech (cs), and Hungarian (hu)from mere tens of hours to ten thousand hours. As baseline, we sample real audio in amounts matching the data originally used for TTS training (100 hours for vi, 50 hours 5 Figure 4: Whispers performance improves consistently with larger models and more training data. We train five sizes of Whisper models with up to 160,000 hours of data and conduct evaluation on Common Voice 16. We report averaged WER across seven languages. Out-of-Domain Generalization Table 2 shows detailed comparison of model performance in both in-domain (Common Voice) and out-of-domain (Voxpopuli) scenarios. Training with only real transcribed speech from Common Voice (Realonly) yields clear in-domain improvements for both Whisper-medium and Whisper-large (4.0% and 5.0% average WER reduction, respectively), but the generalization to out-of-domain data is limited (just 1.4% and 1.2% average reduction). In contrast, supplementing real data with Speech BT significantly enhances both in-domain (6.6% for Whisper-medium, 6.3% for Whisper-large) and outof-domain performance (4.1% and 3.3%, respectively). This clearly demonstrates that our synthetic data not only improves model robustness withindomain but also enhances generalization capabilities across diverse domains. Scalability with Model and Data Size To further assess scalability, we train five Whisper model variantstiny, base, small, medium, and largeusing the same data mentioned above. Figure 4 presents the averaged WER across all seven languages for each model size at increasing scales of training data up to 160,000 hours. The results show two clear trends. First, adding more training data consistently lowers WER across all model sizes. Second, larger models achieve substantially lower WER at each data scale. These scaling trends suggest that our Speech BT approach effectively improves multilingual ASR performance across different model and data scales. Figure 5: Impact of training data quantity and epochs on Vietnamese TTS quality. The purple dashed line shows the WER of natural speech from Fleurs. 5.3 TTS Quality vs ASR Performance We now investigate extending TTS support to new language, Vietnamese, using limited amounts of transcribed speech data. To explore how the quantity of training data impacts TTS model performance, we sampled datasets at increments of {20,40,60,80,100} hours and trained each for up to 10 epochs. The results, shown in Figure 5, clearly indicate that performance consistently improves as the amount of training data and the number of epochs increase. Specifically, the model trained on the 100-hour dataset reaching WER of 10% in the end, which closely approaches the baseline WER for natural speech. Next, we analyze the relationship between TTS model quality and downstream ASR performance. We selected several checkpoints from the finetuned TTS models, varying by the amount of training data and the number of epochs. For each checkpoint, we generated 100 hours of synthetic speech and subsequently used it to train Whisper-medium. We then measured the resulting changes in WER (denoted as WER, where negative values indicate improvement) on the Common Voice dataset. The correlation between each checkpoints normalized intelligibility score (see Equation 2) and ASR performance is illustrated in Figure 6. Our analysis reveals strong correlation between TTS intelligibility scores and ASR performance improvements. Notably, we identified critical intelligibility threshold around 0.01, serving as clear inflection point. Below this threshold, TTS-generated speech leads to increased WER, degrading ASR performance by up to 2 points. Conversely, once 6 Models WER Whisper-medium + in-domain fine-tune Approach 1 + Synthetic data pre-train + in-domain fine-tune Approach 2 + Synthetic data pre-train Approach 3 + Synthetic data pre-train 25.4 21.6 21.2 20.4 20. 18.6 Figure 6: Relationship between TTS quality and ASR performance. Higher TTS intelligibility correlates with greater ASR improvement. Table 3: Vietnamese WER performance on Common Voice using different approaches for leveraging limited in-domain data. the threshold is surpassed, synthetic speech consistently enhances ASR accuracy, with greater intelligibility corresponding to more pronounced reductions in WER. This underscores the importance of achieving minimum TTS quality level for effective ASR data augmentation. Additionally, the volume of TTS training data significantly influences the ability to surpass this intelligibility threshold. Models trained on larger datasets generally achieve higher intelligibility scores and yield greater ASR performance gains. However, we observe diminishing returns as normalized intelligibility approaches 1.0, where WER reductions stabilize around 3 percentage points. This finding suggests that while adequate training data is essential to cross the quality threshold, further improvements in ASR performance may plateau beyond certain point. 5.4 Effective Utilization of Limited In-Domain Transcribed Audio The experiments in Section 5.3 are essentially conducted under out-of-domain conditions, as the TTS models are trained on the viVoice dataset but the final ASR performance are evaluated with the Common Voice dataset. Notably, we identified only about three hours of transcribed audio in Common Voice Vietnamese available for training. This prompts an important research question: how can we effectively leverage such small but valuable amount of in-domain data? We propose three methods for effectively utilizing the in-domain data to enhance model performance: Approach 1: Pre-train Whisper on large-scale synthetic data followed by supervised finetuning using the limited in-domain data. Approach 2: Prompt the fine-tuned Vietnamese TTS model with in-domain audio clips for speech synthesis. Approach 3: Further fine-tune the Vietnamese TTS model with in-domain data before synthesizing speech. For all three approaches, we utilize fine-tuned XTTS checkpoints trained on 100 hours of transcribed speech and generate 1,000 hours of synthetic speech for pre-training Whisper-medium. Table 3 summarizes the resulting WERs. As baseline, we first fine-tune Whisper-medium on three hours of in-domain data, which alone reduces WER from 25.4 to 21.6 and demonstrates the effectiveness of even limited domain adaptation. By combining synthetic speech pre-training on 1,000 hours and subsequent in-domain fine-tuning (Approach 1), we obtain further WER reduction to 20.4. However, the most pronounced improvements arise from leveraging in-domain data within the TTS pipeline itself (Approach 2 and 3). Simply prompting fine-tuned XTTS model with in-domain audio achieves WER of 20.1, already outperforming the synthetic pre-training baseline. Adding dedicated fine-tuning stage for XTTS on the three hours of Common Voice audio (Approach 3) yields the best overall WER of 18.6a 27.0% relative improvement over the 25.4 baseline. This underscores the value of adapting both the TTS and ASR models to the target domain, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. In summary, leveraging small in-domain datasetthrough synthetic pretraining, language-specific fine-tuning, and TTSbased in-domain adaptationproves highly effective for improving ASR performance under realworld low-resource conditions."

Starting from the baseline approach in Section 5.2, we implement several key enhancements: Training Data Expansion We expand coverage to ten languages by incorporating three additional onesEnglish, Chinese, and Vietnamese. We also extend the amount of real speech: in addition to Common Voice (Ardila et al., 2019), we include real transcribed speech from Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b), Voxpopuli (Wang et al., 2021), and viVoice, bringing the total amount of real data to 15,000 hours. Most significantly, we scale our synthetic speech dataset to 500,000 hoursa volume more than thirty times larger than the real data. The statistics of training data is illustrated in Appendix G. Backbone Model and Baselines We adopt Whisper-large-v3, one of the state-of-the-art multilingual ASR models with 1.5B parameters, as our backbone model. For comparison, we include two ASR models with similar sizesSeamlessM4T-medium (Communication et al., 2023) and Whisper-large-v2 (Radford et al., 2022)as our baselines for their competitive performance and wide language coverage. Results We evaluate both our models and baseline models on three benchmarks, Common Voice, Voxpopuli, and Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS), and present the results in Table 4. We report the averaged results for each language category. Results demonstrate clear performance trajectory, training Whisper-large-v3 with 15K hours of real audio consistently improves performance across all benchmarks, while augmenting with 500K hours of Speech-BT data yields further substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art results across all language categories. On average across all benchmarks, our full model achieves 30% error rate reduction over the base Whisper-large-v3. Breaking this down by language groups, high-resource and mid-resource languages achieve 26% and 30% improvements respectively, while low-resource languages achieve remarkable 46% improvement.

            "content": "While our approach demonstrates significant improvements in multilingual ASR performance, several limitations should be noted. First, the synthetic speech data generated through TTS models may not fully capture the acoustic complexity present in real-world environments, particularly in scenarios with background noise, multiple speakers, or variable recording conditions. This limitation could impact model robustness when deployed in settings with poor signal-tonoise ratios or challenging acoustic environments. Second, although we introduce an intelligibilitybased metric for assessing synthetic speech quality, this assessment framework may not comprehensively capture all relevant aspects of speech that could influence ASR training effectiveness. Future work could explore additional quality metrics that consider factors such as prosody and emotional expression. Third, our experimental validation is primarily based on two TTS models (XTTS and ChatTTS), which may not represent the full spectrum of TTS capabilities and limitations. more comprehensive evaluation across broader range of TTS systems could provide additional insights into the generalizability of our approach and identify potential TTS-specific biases or artifacts. Lastly, while we demonstrate the scalability of our method by generating 500,000 hours of synthetic speech, our language coverage remains limited to ten languages, with nine already supported by existing TTS models. Further research is needed to validate our approachs effectiveness in other low-resource languages, particularly those with distinct phonological characteristics or limited linguistic resources."

            "content": "We accelerate inference by integrating DeepSpeedInference (Aminabadi et al., 2022) into the TTS pipeline. DeepSpeeds deep fusion merges multiple tiny CUDA launches into single, highly optimized kernel that combines element-wise operations, matrix multiplications, transpositions, and reductions. Merging these operations reduce kernel-invocation overhead and off-chip memory traffic, translating into noticeably lower latency and higher throughput. We compound these gains with batch inference. Input sentences are grouped by language and length, then paired with single audio prompt that supplies the target voice. Custom attention masks mark prompttext boundaries, allowing the TTS model to synthesize multiple utterances concurrently. This batching strategy reduces redundant computations and GPU idle time, dramatically improving overall inference efficiency."

            "content": "In this section, we present comparative analysis of XTTS and ChatTTS for generating synthetic audio in Chinese and English. Table 5 summarizes the architectural details of both models. As the XTTSs training data mainly come from Common Voice, we treat Common Voice 16 as the in-domain dataset and Fleurs as the out-of-domain dataset for evaluation. Performance Comparison We synthesize speech from 100K Chinese and English sentences using both models and train Whisper-medium to assess the effectiveness of these synthetic datasets. As shown in Figure 7 (a) and (b), XTTS outperforms ChatTTS on in-domain Chinese data, whereas ChatTTS excels on out-of-domain Chinese data. For English, XTTS achieves WER of 4.0%, surpassing ChatTTSs 4.4%. These trends highlight each models distinct strengths in handling language-specific characteristics. TTS Quality Comparison To understand the performance difference, We assess the TTS quality with our proposed normalized intelligibility metric for both models. As shown in Figure 7, XTTS achieves superior intelligibility in English Figure 7: Comparison of Whisper-medium ASR performance on in-domain (CV16) and out-of-domain (Fleurs) test sets, as well as TTS quality, when training with synthetic Chinese and English speech generated by XTTS and ChatTTS. (0.96 vs 0.74) while ChatTTS excels in Chinese (0.87 vs 0.59). Nevertheless, XTTS performs better on in-domain Chinese data, suggesting that while ChatTTS produces more intelligible speech in general, XTTS is more effective within the specific domain represented by Common Voice 16. This discrepancy may be attributed to domain-matched acoustic patterns and speaking styles that XTTS models more accurately. Meanwhile, on out-ofdomain data (Fleurs), ChatTTSs superior general intelligibility dominates, leading to stronger performance. In English, XTTS demonstrates higher intelligibility and more robust ASR results compared to ChatTTS. Overall, these findings underscore how TTS models domain alignment and language-specific strengths can influence synthetic data quality and downstream ASR performance."

WMT (Barrault et al., 2019) We also collected textual data from the training split of WMT19 translation task, which is widely-used training data source in machine translation research. Books Our Books dataset is sourced primarily from Project Gutenberg, digital library of public domain literature. Book-level de-duplication is performed to ensure the quality and uniqueness of the corpus. Europarl (Koehn, 2005) Europarl is parallel corpus created for training machine translation systems, containing aligned text in European languages extracted from European Parliament proceedings. We utilize 8th version of the dataset. SkyPile (Wei et al., 2023) SkyPile is largescale Chinese dataset containing approximately 150 billion tokens, curated specifically for pretraining large language models. The corpus is compiled from diverse Chinese web pages across the public internet and undergoes rigorous quality control, including thorough document-level deduplication and content filtering. Whisper We train Whisper using AdamW (Î²1 = 0.9, Î²2 = 0.98, Ïµ = 1e 8) with weight decay of 0.01. We use constant learning rate 7e 6 after 5% warm-up steps.

For evaluation, we generate transcripts with greedy decoding. XTTS Before fine-tuning, we expand the models text vocabulary by incorporating 2,000 additional Vietnamese tokens by running Byte-Pair Encoding algorithms over Vietnamese textual data. We used the AdamW optimizer Î²1 = 0.9, Î²2 = 0.96, and Ïµ = 1e 8 with weight decay 0.01, and learning rate of 5e-6. The batch size is set to 32."

This research builds upon previous efforts that address data scarcity through synthetic data generation. Bartelds et al.

Additional 500K-Hour Scaling Results In this section, we show detailed results for each languages from Section 5.5. The results for Multilingual Librispeech (MLS), Voxpopuli, and Common Voice 16 are presented in Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10 respectively. Additionally, we make comparisons with state-of-the-art multilingual ASR models: SeedASR (Bai et al., 2024), SeamlessM4T (Communication et al., 2023), Canary (Puvvada et al., 2024), and Whisper-large and Whisper-large-v2 (Radford et al., 2022). for data augmentation in low-resource languages. Their key finding was that VC system trained on well-resourced language like English could generate effective training data for previously unseen low-resource languages. More recently, Gao et al. (2024) proposed using diffusion models to generate high-quality synthetic audio for self-supervised pre-training. The authors suggest that diffusion models are particularly adept at capturing complex speech structures from real audio, making the synthetic data especially valuable for self-supervised learning tasks. F.2 Text-Based Back-Translation Back-Translation (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Edunov et al., 2018) is originally proposed machine translation (Sennrich et al., 2016b; Pan et al., 2024) to augment the limited parallel training corpus from the large amount of monolingual textual data. It is designed to translate the target-language data into the source language, generatin additional synthetic parallel data that boosts overall translation quality (Sennrich et al., 2016a). This method capitalizes on monolingual text resources, which are more abundant than parallel corpora, thereby increasing model robustness and reducing overfitting. Subsequent work has explored variants of back-translation such as iterative backtranslation, filtering synthetic data by quality, and domain adaptation strategies (Edunov et al., 2018; In addition, dual learning Hoang et al., 2018). frameworks have incorporated back-translation and forward-translation jointly for unsupervised and semi-supervised machine translation scenarios (He et al., 2016; Lample et al., 2018). These developments underscore the broader impact of synthetic data in enhancing model performance, even where labeled data are sparse. F.3 Speech Translation Beyond text-based machine translation, speech translation deals with converting audio signals in one language to either text or audio in another language, frequently via cascading automatic speech recognition and machine translation modules or through end-to-end systems (Cheng et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023). One persistent challenge in this domain, especially for lower-resource languages, is the scarcity of paired audio-transcript data. widely used approach to address this limitation is to create pseudo-labeled data by transcribing existing audio and then translating the resulting tran14 Model SeedASR SeamlessM4T-medium Canary Whisper-large Whisper-large-v2 Whisper-large-v + Real-only (15K Hrs) + Speech BT (500K Hrs) Size en - 4.1 1.2B 9.8 1.0B 5.1 1.5B 7.2 1.5B 6.8 1.5B 5.3 5.5 - 5.2 - High fr 5.1 7.9 4.4 8.8 7.4 5.6 5.1 4.3 de - 8.9 4.7 7.4 6.4 6.0 5.7 4.9 es 3.8 5.4 3.4 5.3 4. 4.0 3.5 3.0 Mid nl it - 13.6 - 11.1 10. 10.4 10.2 8.5 - 12.3 - 14.1 12.9 9.9 8.5 6.7 Table 8: Performance comparison across languages on Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS).
