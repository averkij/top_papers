            "title": "1 Introduction\nThe rapid spread of misinformation on social media has become a\ncritical social concern, threatening the reliability of public knowl-\nedge. For instance, to defend the truth, even scientists in Nature1\nhave been involved in debunking fake news. However, manual\nfact-checking is time-consuming and limited in coverage, making\nit difficult to mitigate the viral propagation of false claims. This\nunderscores the urgent need for automated fake news detection\nmethods that not only verify the factuality but also provide clear\nand trustworthy explanations. Consequently, recent automated fact-\nchecking (AFC) approaches rely on powerful Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) to verify the claims and provide explanations. HISS [64]\nutilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [22] to decompose\nLLM reasoning trajectories into explanations, L-Defense [54] distills\nexplanations from powerful models to fine-tune smaller language\nmodels (SLMs), adapting to fact-checking tasks. RAV [51] constructs\nmulti-agent systems to directly assign specialized functions.",
            "content": "Despite these advances, they share fundamental limitation: treating explanation generation as an external post-hoc process. This process heavily depends on external retrieval or closed-source APIs, which obscure the reasoning pathway, increase latency, and even amplify hallucinations. Moreover, after being repeatedly fine-tuned on fast-changing social media claims, these models inevitably suffer from knowledge conflicts between external knowledge and the models internal representations an alignment tax that degrades factual consistency [10, 16]. Such designs overlook the rich factual representations already encoded within LLMs. To bridge this gap, we observe that intervening on models internal knowledge as an alternative to external supervision during inference time[39], shows great potential to realign the factuality and direct to humanobservable truth, thereby reducing misconceptions, as evaluated in TruthfulQA [26]. Given that LLMs inherently encode extensive real-world truths [24], we argue that the key challenge lies not in acquiring more information but in activating these latent representations in controlled and interpretable manner. This insight motivated us to explore how internal activations can guide models toward more challenging, rapidly changing human-unknown truths that are otherwise prone to misinformation. To this end, we propose the REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations (REFLEX), self-refining and plug-and-play 1https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02876-1 Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Chuyi Kong, Gao Wei, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, and Yaxin Fan Figure 1: The brief outline of our three-stage REFLEX paradigm. The red text denotes reasoning style learned from fine-tuning, and the blue text denotes factual knowledge stored in backbone models. paradigm that steers models internal activations to jointly verdict claim and refine explanation. The key to our recipe is to leverage internal signals that distinguish factual substance from stylistic behavior, enabling the model to reflect on and refine its reasoning. Conceptually, REFLEX operates in three stages. First, it reformulates fact-checking as role-play dialogue, where models generates factual verdict and its explanation, allowing self-explanation during training. Second, self-distillation is applied to both the backbone and fine-tuned variants, identifying contrasitive pairscases where their outputs disagree (Quadrant II and IV in Figure 1)revealing where factual reasoning diverges. Third, these pairs are used to identify the steering directions in latent space. We employ simple logistic probe to separate activations, producing steering vector [13] that disentangles truth into (a) substance, representing factual knowledge grounded in the backbone (Quadrant IV), and (b) style, capturing reasoning patterns learned during fine-tuning (Quadrant II). During inference, RELFEX dynamically selects the more reliable direction and refines the explanation at the activation level. In this way, the fact-checker not only generates accurate factual judgments but also produces consistent explanations. Experiments show that REFLEX outperforms methods relying on external resources in both verdict accuracy and explanation quality, even surpassing the skyline, where ChatGPT generates explanations from the claim and verdict, with concise style. Meanwhile, it can generalize across backbones and pair combinations with limited samples, demonstrating strong transferability, flexibility, and data efficiency. Models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without such objectives, achieving 7.57% improvement in verdict accuracy. Upon further analysis, we find that, unlike human-observable truths, human-unknown truths in fact-checking are challenging for the traditional single-direction steering. They exhibit neither probability gaps nor performance gains in higher layers [7], reflecting their subtle and fine-grained complexity. REFLEX, however, achieves its largest probability gaps and performance gains in the middle-layer activations, where disentangling verdict factuality from noisy explanation styles, and improving explanation readability by up to 14%, further confirming its disentanglement efficiency. Notably, REFLEX achieves state-ofthe-art results on RAW-FC dataset [59] using only 465 self-refined samples, without relying on any external APIs. Overall, our main contributions are as follows: We propose REFLEX, plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that disentangles truth into substance and style, enhancing interpretability and steering efficiency. REFLEX achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets with only small set of self-refined samples, while producing high-quality explanations. We show that explanations serve dual rolenot only enhance human understanding but also act as internal activation signals to enhance factual reasoning. We find that REFLEX represents human-unknown truths in middle layers due to its complexity, whereas the humanobservable truths are embedded in higher layers."

RAV [51] constructs multi-agent dialogue system to iteratively recon, answer, and validate claims. L-Denfense [54] distills adversarial evidence explanations from teacher models. Despite their advancements, they face several key limitations: retrieval-based methods are prone to majority bias and noise from external sources; multiagent systems introduce inference latency, which is problematic for time-sensitive fact-checking; and distillation-based fine-tuning weakens internal interpretability and may amplify hallucinations. Inspired by self-training [1] and STaRs [62] frameworks, our REFLEX introduces self-refining distillation paradigm that runs only once, enabling transferable and plug-and-play steering vectors[39] to enhance factuality and model internal interpretability."

            "content": "In contrast to prior works that identify stylistic cues from input claims, our paradigm captures style at the model output level with steering vectors [4, 24, 45]. It builds on controllable generation [8, 21, 25] and activation editing [14, 23], which steer factual directions on human-observable truths such as those in TruthfulQA [26]. These truths are easy to steer. In fact-checking, however, human-unknown truths are tightly entangled with stylistic patterns, as claims and explanations interact. Our paradigm explicitly separates style from substance, enabling both interpretability and robustness in AFC."

To better reflect real-world fact-checking and reduce hallucination risk, we use three datasets in which claims come from professional fact-checking platforms and all explanations are human-written: RAW-FC [59] from Snopes2, LIAR-RAW [59] from PolitiFact3, and AveriTec [47]. In RAW-FC and LIAR-RAW, explanations directly justify the claim label; in AveriTec, they justify both the claim and its supporting evidence. For consistency, we refer to all of them as explanations. Regarding data structure, RAW-FC and LIAR-RAW follow the standard fact-checking format with instances claim, evidence, label, explanation. AveriTec instead decomposes fact-checker reasoning into QA-style, multi-turn verification process. The three datasets use different label schemes. RAW-FC contains {true, half, false}; LIAR-RAW uses six labels; and AveriTec uses {Supported, Not Enough Evidence, Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking, Refuted}. To enable joint verdict prediction and explanation generation in REFLEX, we unify labels as follows: in LIAR-RAW, we merge {pants-fire, false, barely-true} into False, keep Half-True, and merge {mostly-true, true} into True. In AveriTec, we drop Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking due to its ambiguity. We remove LIAR-RAW 2www.snopes.com 3www.politifact.com REFLEX: Self-Refining Explainable Fact-Checking via Disentangling Truth into Style and Substance Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA instances without evidence and exclude AveriTec few-shot examples from validation to prevent leakage. As shown in Table 1, RAW-FC is label-balanced, while the others are not. Since AveriTec does not release test set(to avoid leakage), we use its validation set for testing after removing overlapping samples during training. Finally, since some baselines cannot process dialogue-style data, we report baseline comparisons only on RAW-FC and LIAR-RAW. Metrics. For verdict evaluation, we report Precision, Recall, and Macro-F1. For explanation quality, following [54], we employ LLM as judge [12], where ChatGPT scores explanations along four dimensions: misleadingness, informativeness, soundness, and readability(more details in Appendix A). Each dimension is rated on five-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating better quality except misleadingness, which is inversely scored. Moreover, our human evaluation (Appendix C) confirms the consistency between manual and automatic assessments. Training Setup. As mentioned in Section 3.2, we construct all data in role-playing dialogue format: the human poses query containing claim (and optional evidence), and the assistant, acting as fact-checker, responds with verdict and the corresponding explanation. For RAW-FC and LIAR-RAW, evidence corresponds to the annotated relevant evidence (labeled as 1). For AveriTec, which is natively multi-turn, we flatten each dialogue into single-turn instance for consistency with the other datasets. More training details are provided in Appendix D."

Compared with FactLLaMA, built on the same backbone and data but without dialogue style or full-parameter tuning, our model achieves 4.94% to 6.83% F1 gain.

Since our models operate with unified three-way label scheme following explanation-based methods, no comparison is made on LIAR-RAW in this part for fair comparison. For explanation quality, We evaluate only baselines that generate explanations. Following Wang et al. [54], we map LIAR-RAWs six labels to three and apply the same mapping to all applicable baselines. We also include an Oracle that supplies ChatGPT with the claim and verdict to produce explanations as the skyline. As shown in Table 3, after Stage 1, our model achieves state-of-the-art scores on RAW-FC in misleadingness, informativeness, and soundness, exceeding only L-Defense (ChatGPT-distilled) in readability. On LIAR-RAW, it reaches state-of-the-art informativeness and readability, ranking second to L-Defense (LLaMA2) in soundness. After applying EGS, all metrics further improve, except for slight increase in misleadingness on RAW-FC, which we attribute to the strong disentanglement between verdict accuracy and explanation style. To address potential length bias in LLM-as-Judges [12], we analyze explanation length in Appendix B. On RAW-FC, given the same backbone (LLaMA2), our explanations are shorter than those of L-Defense.

We performed training and inference across different stages, pair combinations, and reported hallucination rates and inference success rates. Formally, we define the hallucination rate (HR) and inferenc success rate (ISR) as: HR = #error after SFT #correct on BASE , ISR = #correct after SFT #error on BASE . (6) (7) Overall, as shown in Table 4, EGS improves performance across the three datasets by up to 5.03% compared with fine-tuned models in most cases. We focus on error cases with drop rate above 0.01%. Specifically, for LLaMA-2 and Qwen-3 on LIAR-RAW using (𝑐 𝑣;exp) pairs, macro-F drops by 0.2%. Table 2 shows that these pairs perform poorly even at the base stage. Our analysis attributes this mainly to severe recency bias during few-shot learning, where the model tends to predict the last sample label, despite several existing methods addressing it [29, 31, 35, 36, 63]. The detailed label distribution for error cases is provided in Appendix F. Next, we analyze backbone models and datasets from three perspectives: combination performance, stage-wise performance, and hallucination & reasoning success ratio. From Table 4, we observe: (1) Base Models: LLaMA-2 performs best when only the claim is input and the verdict is output (𝑐 𝑣), likely due to limited inherent reasoning ability [9]. In contrast, Qwen-3 benefits from inputting evidence and outputting explanations (𝑐;𝑒𝑣𝑖 𝑣;𝑒𝑥𝑝), reflecting its stronger reasoning capacity [9].

After fine-tuning, only Qwen-3 surpasses the golden evidence on RAWFC due to its 32 longer context window. (3) Stage-wise Performance: Most models improve after finetuning. An exception is RAWFC, where fine-tuned models, especially LLaMA-2, perform worse than base models, likely due to up-sampling of factual knowledge from Wikipedia during pre-training [53]. (4) Dataset Difficulty: Along with Tables 5, AveriTEC, constructed in dialogue format, is the easiest, yielding minimal hallucinations and high reasoning success. LIAR-RAW is the most challenging, with the highest hallucination rates and lowest model performance. 4.2.2 On Pairs Combinations. To demonstrate the flexibility and transferability of our paradigm and achieve further improvements, we examine pairs with mismatched style across training stages. Vertical steering follows previous setup, but instead pairs outputs from the base model (c->vbase) with those from the SFT model (c->v;expsft). Horizontal steering pairs only SFT model outputs (c->vsft) with (c->v;expsft) for direct steering. For clarity, the evidence inputs for AveriTEC are omitted from this point onward. As shown in Table 6, except for AveriTEC, both vertical and horizontal steering improve performance, highlighting the flexibility and transferability of our paradigm. Notably, using verdicts with explanation-guided vectors (𝑐 𝑣; exp) to steer models given only claims (𝑐 𝑣) yields gains up to 8.38%, demonstrating that the explanation can act as internal activation signals to improve factuality. For AveriTEC, performance drops slightly, which we attribute to its simplicity, as discussed in Section 4.2.1, making improvements quickly saturate. 4.2.3 On Model Internal interpretability. To enhance model interpretability, we conduct ablation studies along two axes: the optimal layer and the model direction with the largest probability gap. Optimal layer. As Figure 2 shows, for pairs involving claim-only, the largest gaps appear in early layers (15), while for pairs with full explanations, gaps peak in middle layers (1020). This pattern aligns with model internal interpretability: early layers capture lexical and topical features, middle layers encode style and syntax, and higher layers abstract concepts [61]. Unlike misconceptions and commonsense in truthfulQA, where human-observable truths peak at higher layers [7], fact-checking truth does not exhibit largeest gaps in later layers. We attribute this to the subtle, fine-grained complexity of human-unknown truth in fact-checking, which remains challenging even for humans. Model direction. To further validate the disentanglement efficiency, we take REFLEX after EGS as the baseline (stylesubstance), REFLEX: Self-Refining Explainable Fact-Checking via Disentangling Truth into Style and Substance Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Table 4: The macro-F1 scores of S-EGS across backbones and datasets.

Next, we compute the correlation matrix between model performance (F-score and accuracy) and the four explanation metrics. As shown in Figure 3, three key findings emerge: (1) F-score is strongly negatively correlated with misleadingness, strongly positively correlated with soundness, positively correlated with readability, and largely independent of informativeness. (2) Accuracy shows similar pattern, except it has mild negative correlation with informativeness. (3) Informativeness is negatively correlated with readability, but positively correlated with both misleadingness and soundness. This is intuitive: more informative explanations often introduce extra background, which improves soundness but also injects noise, leading to misleading content and drop in accuracy.

From Style to Facts: Mapping the Boundaries of Knowledge Injection with Finetuning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.05919 (2025). Prompt Template Following [5, 28], the prompt template we use to conduct training and inference for claims is as follows: chat between curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. You are fact-checking assistant. You are given claim [(along with evidence sentences)]. Your task is to label the overall veracity of the claim based on your internal knowledge [or, on the provided evidence sentences]. The Label Definitions are as follows: TRUEtrue: The claim is verified as TRUEtrue based on your knowledge. FALSEfase: The claim is verified as FALSEfalse based on your knowledge. HALF-TRUEhalf: The claim is verified as half-true due to insufficient knowledge leading to uncertainty, or because the claim itself is partially true. ##### or, for given evidence: TRUEtrue: The claim is verified as true or mostly-true by the evidence. FALSEfalse: The claim is verified as false or mostly false by the evidence. HALF-TRUEhalf: The claim is verified as half-truehalf by the evidence, or the evidence can not prove the claim. ##### or, for AveriTec: Supported: The claim is supported by the arguments and evidence presented. Refuted: The claim is contradicted by the arguments and evidence presented. Not Enough Evidence: There is not enough evidence to support or refute the claim. Based on the below claim and your own knowledge, determine the veracity of the claim. ##### or, for given evidence: Based on the below claim and evidence, determine the veracity of the claim. Please strictly output in the following format: Verdict: [label]. Explanation: [your reasoning here] Consistent with [54], the template we used to prompt ChatGPT to conduct Automatic Evaluations is shown below: You are helpful, harmless and precise assistant. Please evaluate the quality of the explanations in prediction based on four metrics: misleadingness, informativeness, REFLEX: Self-Refining Explainable Fact-Checking via Disentangling Truth into Style and Substance Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA soundness, and readability, where 1 represented the poorest and 5 the best in addition to misleadingness. The definitions of the metrics are: (1) Misleadingness assesses whether the models explanation is consistent with the real veracity label of claim, with rating scale ranging from 1 (not misleading) to 5 (very misleading); (2) Informativeness assesses whether the explanation provides new information, such as explaining the background and additional context, with rating scale ranging from 1 (not informative) to 5 (very informative) (3) Soundness describes whether the explanation seems valid and logical, with rating scale ranging from 1 (not sound) to 5 (very sound) (4) Readability evaluates whether the explanation follows proper grammar and structural rules, and whether the sentences in the explanation fit together and are easy to follow, with rating scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Please output scores in the following JSON format: ``` {{ Misleadingness: [an integer number from 1 to 5], Informativeness: [an integer number from 1 to 5], Soundness: [an integer number from 1 to 5], Readability: [an integer number from 1 to 5] }} ``` Claim: {claim} Label: {label} Prediction: {verdict} Score: Explanation Length As Table 9 shows, on RAW-FC (aligned to LLaMA2), our outputs are shorter than L-Defense. On Liar-RAW, they are shorter than all baselines, including the oracle, demonstrating that our paradigm produces concise and accurate explanations. Table 14 further shows that EGS clearly reduces noisy patterns in model outputs across backbones and datasets. Table 9: The explanation length for ours and baselines.

Model identities were kept anonymous, and the average scores were used as the final metric. Table 12 shows that all four dimensions have correlation coefficients above 0.70 (0.94, 0.77, 0.80, 0.73), validating LLM-As-Judges [12]. Our S-EGS outperforms others in almost all dimensions, except misleadingness, likely due to sample randomness and strong disentanglement. Training Details As Table 10 shows, except for gradient accumulation steps and maximum context length, which depend on dataset size and sample length, we trained models on 14A100-80G GPUs with learning rate of 2e-5, per-device batch size of 4, weight decay 0, warmup ratio 0.03, and cosine scheduler, bf16/tf32 precision, gradient checkpointing, and full-shard FSDP with auto wrapping. For LLaMA-2, the epoch-2 checkpoint was selected, achieving the best balance between factual accuracy and instruction following. For Qwen-3, severe overfitting occurred at epoch 2 on some LiarRAW and RAW-FC variants (training accuracy exceeded test by 2040%), so the epoch-1 checkpoint was used.
