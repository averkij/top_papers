            "content": "Humans possess the remarkable ability to focus on specific speaker amidst cacophony of sounds, including background noise, reverberation, and interfering voices. This capability is famously referred to as the cocktail-party effect [1]. For many years, researchers have endeavored to emulate this sophisticated auditory skill using algorithms. Target Speech Extraction (TSE) emerges as promising field, aiming to isolate desired speakers voice from complex mixture of multiple speakers, alongside any accompanying noise or reverberation [2]. TSE leverages cues, which serve as identifiers for the target speaker, to accurately extract their speech from mixture. Various types of cues have been investigated to address the TSE problem. These include spatial cues [3, 4], visual cues [5], concept cues [6], and audio cues [7, 8]. In this paper, we specifically focus on monaural TSE methods that utilize the most prevalent audio-based cues. significant challenge in TSE lies in distinguishing between target and non-target speakers, as their speech signals often share similar characteristics, complicating the extraction process [9]. To overcome this, many researchers have concentrated on discriminative model-based TSE, which directly maps the mixture signal to the target signal by optimizing signal-level metrics [10, 11, 12]. Both time-domain [13, 14, 15] and time-frequency (T-F) domain methodologies [16, 17] have Corresponding Author. Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: Overall pipeline of SoloSpeech. been investigated. While these discriminative approaches are highly effective, they can sometimes introduce artifacts and are often sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing conditions [18, 19]. In contrast, generative approaches model the joint distribution of the mixture speech, the target speech, and the cue speech. Various deep generative models have been explored for tasks such as speech enhancement, dereverberation, and separation [20, 21, 22]. These models have demonstrated the ability to exhibit greater robustness in unseen scenarios than discriminative models [20, 19]. They are capable of achieving high clarity in overlapping regions where multiple speakers converse simultaneously [23]. However, current generative approaches still result in separated speech with reduced audio quality and intelligibility, leading mainstream TSE solutions to continue relying on discriminative methods [24]. To consistently enhance the quality and intelligibility of generative models for TSE, we introduce SoloSpeech2, novel cascaded generative pipeline that comprises three key components: generative audio compressor, generative target extractor, and generative corrector. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce such pipeline for speech extraction and separation. The audio compressor utilizes T-F domain variational autoencoder (VAE) to transform audio waveforms into latent representations and vice versa. The target extractor employs latent diffusion model to derive the latent representation of the target signal. Notably, we propose speaker-embedding-free model for the target extractor, where the mixture audio and the cue audio (i.e. condition) are fused using cross-attention mechanism [25] in the same latent space, preventing potential mismatches. Furthermore, inspired by recent research on error correction with generative models [19, 26, 27], we propose T-F domain diffusion model as the corrector. This model addresses errors introduced by the target extractor and refines the audio quality, ensuring high quality and intelligibility in the extracted speech. We evaluated the proposed pipeline on the Libri2Mix noisy benchmark dataset [28] and demonstrated its significant superiority over existing methods in both TSE and Speech Separation (SS) tasks, the latter aiming to separate all speakers from the mixture audio. SoloSpeech achieves new state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, naturalness, and intelligibility, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in noisy acoustic scenarios. Moreover, experiments on three out-ofdomain datasets and two real-word datasets showed that SoloSpeech exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen conditions."

            "content": "The audio compressor operates on raw waveforms, compressing them into manageable sequence lengths. Current advanced audio compressors utilize time-domain VAEs with several convolutional blocks [29, 30, 31]. Inspired by the success of T-F domain modeling for mixture speech signals [32, 33], we propose novel T-F domain VAE as the audio compressor. As illustrated in Figure 2, the encoder first applies the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) [34] to transform the input audio signal R1N into complex spectrum R2F , where denotes the audio length, the hop size of STFT, and the number of frequency bins. The real and imaginary components are concatenated along the first dimension. and the variance σx R1D Our VAE adopts TF-GridNet [32] as its backbone network, which comprises several TF-GridNet blocks. The encoder outputs latent representation of shape R12D , which is then split into two parts: the mean µx R1D . The latent representation is obtained by sampling from this distribution, denoted as (µx, σx) where R1D . The decoder mirrors the encoder structure, reconstructing the audio waveform using the inverse STFT (iSTFT). The VAE model is trained in generative and adversarial manner [30]. The loss functions include: (i) perceptually weighted multi-resolution STFT reconstruction loss [35]; (ii) an adversarial loss term with feature matching, utilizing five convolutional discriminators as in Encodec [36]; and (iii) KL divergence loss term. See appendix C.1 for details. 2.3 Target extractor The target extractor operates on the latent representations, aiming to extract the target latents zy from the mixture latents zm, guided by the conditional latents zc. As shown in Figure 3(a), we use modified diffusion scheduler and velocity prediction [37], which have been shown to improve the purity and overall performance of sound extraction [38]. Details of the diffusion process could be found in appendix B. The main network for the target extractor employs diffusion transformer with long skip connections (uDiT) [23], modified version of DiT [39], as detailed in Figure 3(b). These skip connections bridge shallow and deep DiT blocks, creating shortcuts for low-level features and streamlining the training of the entire velocity-prediction network. The input feature is concatenation of the current noisy latent zt and the mixture latent zm in the latent dimension (D). The time feature and the conditional feature are fused into each block. Unlike previous works that introduce speaker embeddings as conditional information [38, 23], our method jointly trains condition transformer to extract the conditional features from the conditional latents zc, which are then attended to by the diffusion transformer using cross-attention mechanism. This approach offers the following advantages: (i) it eliminates the need for extra data or labels to train speaker embedding network; (ii) it preserves the sequential information of the conditional features, such as local dynamics and temporal structures; and (iii) it prevents potential mismatching between VAE latents and other types of features representing the target speech. 3 (a): The architecture of the target extractor. (b): The architecture of Diffusion Transformer (c): The uDiT block Figure 3: The target extractor architecture and backbone. The condition transformer employs ViT-like backbone [40], consisting of several ViT blocks. Each ViT block contains two LayerNorm layers, Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) layer, and MLP layers with SiLU activations [41]. The condition transformer generates sequence of conditional features, which are then attended to by the uDiT blocks. As shown in Figure 3(c), each uDiT block includes an MHSA module, Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) module, and an MLP module. The conditional features are fused by the MHCA module, and the embedded time features are integrated into the MHSA module and the MLP module using Adaptive LayerNorm (AdaLN) layers. SiLU serves as the activation function, and we incorporate rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) [42] for the position encoding in both MHCA and MHSA. Following the reverse process of diffusion models, the target extractor gradually reconstructs the target latents from random Gaussian noise, generating the estimated target latents zy. The speech signal is then obtained from the estimated target latents using the decoder of the audio compressor, resulting in the reference signal xr R1Tm. 2.4 Corrector Diffusion models have been shown to outperform discriminative models for non-additive corruption types or when evaluated under mismatched conditions [21]. However, they often yield worse results on reference-based metrics [43], particularly for latent diffusion models, as VAE reconstruction determines the upper bound of audio quality. In addition, diffusion models may produce vocalizing and breathing artifacts in adverse conditions [44]. Inspired by the success of incorporating generative models to refine signal quality [19], we propose T-F domain diffusion model-based corrector to address these issues. The corrector is designed to: (i) reduce artifacts caused by the front-end models; (ii) improve the signal quality from the audio compressors output by incorporating signal quality-based training objective functions; and (iii) correct errors introduced by the target extractor, such as speaker obfuscation and mispronunciation, thereby enhancing intelligibility. 2.4.1 Fast-GeCo Corrector Inspired by Fast-GeCo [19], we employ single-step diffusion model that allows us to directly optimize signal quality using the Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) loss function [45, 46]. As illustrated in Figure 4(a), Fast-GeCo initially trains multi-step diffusion model, which takes noised signal as input, conditioned on the reference signal, mixture signal, and timestep. The noised signal depends on both the timestep and the reference signal. Subsequently, Fast-GeCo accelerates the traditional multi-step diffusion process by distilling it into single-step operation, thereby producing the refined signal ˆy R1Tm. Given the ground-truth target signal y, the 4 (a): Fast-GeCo corrector (b): SoloSpeech corrector Figure 4: Diagrams of the Fast-GeCo corrector and SoloSpeech corrector. signal-step corrector is optimized by: := 10 log (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) ˆy,yy y2 (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13)ˆy ˆy,yy (cid:13) y2 (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) (1) where y2 = y, denotes the signal power. Scale invariance is maintained by normalizing ˆy and to zero mean before computation. 2.4.2 SoloSpeech Corrector From our initial experiments, we observe that such corrector can improve signal quality and reduce artifacts from the target extractor. However, it may struggle when processing reference signals with speaker obfuscation or mispronunciation. This can result in weak speaker similarity between the target and extracted speech, as well as poor performance in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. We argue that this issue arises because the reference signal already contains sufficient information for the corrector to learn the refinement task, leading to inadequate utilization of the original mixture signal. Consequently, the corrector behaves more like Speech Enhancement (SE) tool rather than TSE tool. To address the above issues, in SoloSpeech, the refined signal is derived from the mixture signal rather than the reference signal, enabling the corrector to function similarly to TSE task. As illustrated in Figure 4(b), the corrector receives noised mixture signal as input. To encourage the corrector to leverage more information from the mixture signal and enhance the intelligibility of the refined signal, we propose simple yet effective augmentation approach for the reference signal. During the training phase, random continuous span of the reference signal is masked. We set the masking ratio as θ. This forces the model to recover the target signal conditioned on corrupted reference signal, thereby compelling it to utilize additional information from the mixture signal. Furthermore, we found that distilling from multi-step model does not significantly improve performance but greatly increases training costs. The performance gains are primarily due to the introduction of the signal quality loss in the single-step model. Therefore, we train the single-step corrector directly from scratch."

            "content": "We conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain TSE experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of SoloSpeech. We also assessed SoloSpeech on the most related SS task alongside TSE. To examine the impact of each component in SoloSpeech, we performed ablation studies on TSE results involving different audio compressors, speaker conditions, and correctors. 3.1 Datasets To evaluate the performance of TSE, we trained models on the Libri2Mix 16k Hz dataset [28], which is simulated using WHAM! noise data [47] and Librispeech utterances [48]. The dataset comprises two training subsets with 212 hours (train-360) and 58 hours (train-100) of audio, respectively. We utilized the train-360 subset for training. The dev set, containing 11 hours of audio, was used for validation. We then evaluated our models on the test set, which includes 11 hours of audio. During inference, the cue speech is different utterance from the target speech by the same speaker, following 5 the same data preparation as in TD-SpeakerBeam [49]. This dataset is also utilized for two-speaker SS experiments. Although Libri2Mix includes different speakers and background noises in its training and test sets, the recording conditions and speaking styles remain highly similar. Following [19], we assessed the trained models on out-of-domain data. Utterances from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus [45] served as the speech source, while noise audio from WHAM!, MUSAN [50], and DEMAND [51] were used as noise sources for simulation. Each of these test sets has duration of 5 hours. Following the approach in [47], noise was introduced by sampling random SNR value from uniform distribution ranging from -6 to +3 dB. Additionally, we generated minimum-length version of the simulated data by removing any leading and trailing noise and truncating it to match the length of the shorter of the two speakers utterances. During inference, we selected random speech sample of the target speaker different from the target speech as the cue speech. We also evaluated the performance on two real-world datasets: CHiME-5 [52] and RealSEP [53]. CHiME-5 consists of real dinner party conversations recorded using distant microphones, featuring up to four overlapping speakers, expressive speech, non-verbal vocalizations (e.g., laughter, sigh), and background sound effects. RealSEP covers ten diverse real-world acoustic scenes, including music, sound effects, strong reverberation, and moving sound sources. Both datasets are highly challenging and contain conditions that are significantly different from those in Libri2Mix, demonstrating the robustness of our method in previously unseen scenarios. For each dataset, we randomly selected 100 mixtures (1020 seconds) and their corresponding 10-second cue audio samples. 3.2 Evaluation metrics To evaluate the performance of SoloSpeech, we conducted TSE experiments using both quality and intelligibility metrics. The perceptual metrics include: (i) Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) [54]; (ii) Extended Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (ESTOI) [55]; (iii) ScaleInvariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) [45]; and (iv) Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score (DNSMOS) [56]. The first three are intrusive speech perceptual quality metrics, while DNSMOS is non-intrusive metric that estimates the overall quality of the audio and naturalness. For the intelligibility metrics, we performed ASR on the speech files using the Whisper large-v3-turbo model3 [57] and calculated the Word Error Rate (WER) using the jiwer toolkit4. In addition, we measured the cosine similarity between the estimated speech and the ground truth using pretrained WavLM-based speaker verification network5 [58] to assess speaker similarity (SIM). For the real-world TSE evaluation, we followed the protocol in [59] and assessed both separation accuracy and perceptual quality through Mean Opinion Score (MOS) test conducted with 12 human raters recruited via Prolific6. Please refer to for detail. We report the mean scores along with 95% confidence intervals. For SS experiments, we evaluated performance using reference-based perceptual metrics, including PESQ improvement (PESQ-i), ESTOI improvement (ESTOI-i), and SI-SNR improvement (SI-SNR-i). Following [19, 60], we introduced reference-free metric for naturalness evaluation, Non-Intrusive Speech Quality Assessment (NISQA) [61]. 3.3 Model configurations For the audio compressor, the STFT utilizes window size of 640 and hop size of 320 (i.e., = 320), resulting in latent representations at 50 Hz. See appendix C.1 for details. The dimensionality is set to 128. During training, we clipped the audio into 100-frame chunks. The VAE was trained using the AdamW optimizer, with batch size of 16, base learning rate of 1.5 104, while the discriminators used learning rate of 3 104. The weight decay was set to 1 103, and training was conducted for 10 epochs. It took two days on one NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU. For the target extractor, we developed three different model sizes. See appendix C.2 for details. The Base model was trained with learning rate of 1 104, weight decay of 1 104, batch size of 32, and for 200 epochs. The training and inference steps were set to 1000 and 50, respectively, with 3https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo 4https://github.com/jitsi/jiwer 5https://huggingface.co/microsoft/wavlm-base-plus-sv 6https://www.prolific.com/ 6 Table 1: Target speech extraction results on the Libri2Mix dataset. are the results of models reproduced by us.

During training, we applied data augmentation by randomly clipping the mixture and cue speech to lengths ranging from 3 seconds up to their original durations. The model was trained on one NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU for six days. During inference, we found that classifier-free guidance (CFG) [62] did not improve performance in TSE. Large guidance scales even tended to produce overly smoothed outputs, with reduced speech detail and degraded intelligibility. As result, we chose to exclude CFG in our pipeline. For the corrector, we employed the same network as Fast-GeCo [19] and set the reverse starting point τ = 0.5, as detailed in appendix C.3. The STFT utilizes window size of 510 and hop size of 128. During training, we clipped the audio into 256-frame chunks. We used learning rate of 1 104, batch size of 16 and 50 epochs, which took three days on one NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU. 3.4 Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we compared SoloSpeech with existing methods. We reproduced the results using the authors official settings. If the authors employed the same dataset as us, we report their metric values as presented in their original papers. See appendix for the details of the baseline methods. In-domain TSE Results. We trained and tested the models on the Libri2Mix dataset. As shown in Table 1, SoloSpeech consistently outperformed existing methods across all metrics, including perceptual quality, naturalness, and intelligibility, achieving 0.95 dB gain in SI-SNR. Compared to discriminative methods, SoloSpeech achieves significant improvements in DNSMOS, demonstrating its powerful ability to produce natural and high-quality audio. Furthermore, when compared with other generative approaches, SoloSpeech significantly outperforms them in perceptual and intelligibility metrics, highlighting its advantages. Higher values of DNSMOS and lower WER also indicate that our method produces fewer artifacts for both listeners and ASR systems. Out-of-domain TSE Results. We trained the models on the Libri2Mix dataset and tested them on three out-of-domain datasets without any fine-tuning. As shown in Table 2, SoloSpeech consistently outperforms existing methods in generalizing to unseen conditions. Specifically, SoloSpeech achieves SI-SNR gains of 16.7%, 16.1%, and 17.6% over the state-of-the-art discriminative method USEF-TSE on the WHAM!, MUSAN, and DEMAND datasets, respectively. Real-world TSE Results. We trained models on the Libri2Mix and tested them on two real-world datasets without any fine-tuning. As shown in Table 2, SoloSpeech significantly outperforms baseline methods in generalizing to real-world challenging scenarios. Remarkably, SoloSpeech is able to generalize to more challenging unseen conditions. For example, handling more overlapping speakers (up to 4 in CHiME-5 vs. 2 in Libri2Mix) and much longer audio durations (up to 20 seconds). Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness to factors such as expressive speech, nonverbal vocalizations, reverberation, and background sound effects. 7 Table 2: Target speech extraction results on the out-of-domain data.

SS Results. We also conducted two-speaker speech separation experiments. Although SoloSpeech is trained to extract one speaker from the mixture audio, we trained another model to remove the target speaker and extract the other speaker. This approach allows for the separation of both speakers voices. Refer to appendix for details of this process. Results on the Libri2Mix dataset are presented in Table 3, where SoloSpeech outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, SoloSpeech achieves 0.94 dB SI-SNR improvement compared to the previous best model, i.e., Fast-GeCo. 3.5 Ablation studies To gain deeper understanding of SoloSpeech, we compared each key component using the Libri2Mix dataset under completely fair setup, employing identical architectures and hyperparameters in the subsequent experiments. Comparison of audio compressors. We compared the proposed T-F Audio VAE with the state-ofthe-art Stable Audio VAE. We employed the VAEs as audio compressors within SoloSpeech and assessed their impact on the TSE task. As presented in Table 4, the newly proposed T-F Audio VAE significantly enhances TSE performance compared to the Stable Audio VAE. Comparison of speaker conditions. We compared different speaker conditions and reported the results in Table 4. Specifically, We evaluated speaker embedding7-based approach with AdaLN [23], considering both fixed and fine-tuned configurations; an SSL-based speaker network8 [64]; 7https://github.com/TaoRuijie/ECAPA-TDNN 8https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/wespeaker_ssl_public 8 Table 4: Impact of the modules.

Our method does not require additional data to train speaker embeddings, yet achieves the best results among all methods. This superiority is attributed to our approachs ability to preserve the sequential information of the conditional features and prevent potential mismatching between VAE latents and other types of features representing the target speech. Impact of the corrector. We investigated the impact of the corrector and present the results in Table 4. Our proposed corrector significantly outperforms the previous work, Fast-GeCo, thereby substantially enhancing perceptual quality and intelligibility. The corrector contributes significantly to SI-SNR and WER gains, as we found that it can significantly improve signal quality and reduce artifacts in high frequencies, which may influence the ASR system. Furthermore, we applied the proposed corrector to two prior baselines, USEF-TSE (a discriminative method) and SoloAudio (a generative method), and reported the results in Table 4. The corrector consistently improved performance across all evaluation metrics. Notably, SoloSpeech still outperforms USEF-TSE even with the corrector applied, especially in DNSMOS scores, highlighting the advantage of generative models in producing more natural-sounding speech. Compared to SoloAudio with the same corrector, SoloSpeech achieves significantly better perceptual quality and intelligibility, demonstrating the effectiveness of our target extractor backbone. Additional ablation studies are provided in Appendix H, including the reconstruction quality of audio compressors (Appendix H.1), hyperparameter tuning of the audio compressor (Appendix H.2), the effect of masking ratios (Appendix H.3), audio durations (Appendix H.4), and model sizes (Appendix H.5). We also present comparison of computational costs in Appendix G."

            "content": "We proposed cascaded generative pipeline that offers strong foundation for future research in generative TSE. Each component is validated for its effectiveness and designed with modularity and scalability in mind. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods in both TSE and SS tasks, SoloSpeech achieves significantly higher perceptual quality, naturalness, and intelligibility. Furthermore, when evaluated on out-of-domain data, SoloSpeech demonstrates excellent generalization and robustness. In real-world evaluations, we observe that strong reverberation and moving sound sources, such as those in the RealSEP dataset, remain challenging, and we leave these issues to future work. We also plan to explore more efficient backbone architectures for each component. 9https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/speakerbeam"

            "content": "A.1 Generative models in TSE Recent works [71, 38] have introduced TSE systems utilizing diffusion probabilistic models, with similar methods being explored for SS [60]. SpeechFlow [22] proposed generative model pretrained on large-scale speech data using flow matching and masked conditions, and Ku, et al. (2024) [72] adapted this method for TSE. Additionally, Yu, et al. (2024) [65] introduced discrete token-based TSE approach by combining speech discretization with vocoder techniques and Ma, et al. (2025) [73] adopted the Whisper audio encoder to improve the intelligibility of generative TSE. These models are capable of generating audio samples with high naturalness and demonstrate good generalization to out-of-domain data. However, they often yield inferior results on reference-based metrics [43]. To further enhance perceptual quality, researchers have begun integrating generative models with In contrast, our proposed SoloSpeech employs fully discriminative models [44, 19, 24, 66]. generative approach, achieving superior perceptual quality, naturalness, and intelligibility. A.2 Conditional information in TSE Conditional information plays pivotal role in TSE by isolating the target speaker and attending to the mixture audio through various fusion layers, such as concatenation [5], multiplication [8], and factorized layers [74, 8]. Existing methods for extracting conditional information can be categorized into speaker embedding-based approaches and speaker embedding-free approaches. Speaker embeddingbased approaches include SpEx+ [14], which trained speaker embeddings from scratch using an auxiliary speaker identification task, X-SepFormer [15], built upon x-vectors [75], X-TF-GridNet [16], which utilized adaptive speaker embedding fusion. [63, 64] used pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models to derive speaker embeddings. Conversely, speaker embedding-free approaches such as SMMA-Net [76] and CIENet [77] employed attention mechanisms to interact with the representations of the reference and mixed signals, VE-VE [78] used an RNN-based voice extractor to capture speaker characteristics, and SEF-Net [79] along with USEF-TSE [17] utilized cross-attention to implicitly leverage speaker information. Our proposed method adopts speaker embedding-free approach, eliminating the need for pre-trained model to extract fixed-length speaker embeddings or align the speaker embedding space with the target latent space. Compared to speaker embedding-based methods, our approach preserves local dynamics and temporal structures, which are crucial for guiding more effective speaker extraction."

            "content": "Although SoloSpeech is trained to extract one speaker from the mixture audio, we trained target speech removal model to remove the target speaker and extract the other speaker. This approach allows for the separation of both speakers voices. As illustrated in Figure 7, the diffusion transformer in the target speech removal model receives four inputs: the noised latent, the mixture latent, the reference latent, and the current timestep. During training, the target latent is obtained from the excluded speakers speech, while the reference latent is derived from the target speakers speech. In inference, the reference latent is obtained from the output of the target extractor model. We used AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 1 104, weight decay of 1 104, batch size of 32, and for 100 epochs. The model was trained on one NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU for three days. Figure 7: Overview of the target speech removal model. The whole pipeline of two-speaker separation using SoloSpeech is illustrated in Figure 8. The target speech is first extracted and then removed, resulting in target speech and interference speech. Another naive manner to achieve speech separation is to simply reuse the original TSE model with the other speakers cue to extract the remaining speech. However, we find in practice that this approach does not produce high-quality complementary separation. We tried such approach that yielded an SI-SNR of 12.35 dB, below the 13.92 dB achieved by our separation method (in Table 3). Figure 8: Overview of two-speaker separation pipeline."

Both SoloSpeech and SoloAudio require considerably less training time than USEF-TSE due to the latentspace processing, enabling more practical large-scale training. While the real-time factor (RTF) of SoloSpeech is slightly higher, it remains suitable for offline or server-side deployment. 21 Since the primary motivation of this work is to achieve consistent improvements in the quality and intelligibility of TSE, particularly in terms of generalization, we argue that modest increase in inference time is reasonable trade-off. Furthermore, SoloSpeechs modular architecture (compressor, extractor, corrector) supports the substitution of each component with more lightweight alternatives, which we plan to explore in future work.

As shown in Table 7, the T-F Audio VAE consistently outperforms the Stable Audio VAE across all metrics, demonstrating superior audio reconstruction quality.

Table 8 summarizes the impact of these configurations. Lower frame rates and smaller latent dimensions generally make it easier to train latent diffusion models. Ultimately, we select frame rate of 50 Hz and latent dimension of 128 as trade-off between training efficiency and reconstruction quality.

We measured SI-SNR for perceptual quality (higher values indicate better quality) and 22 WER for intelligibility (lower values indicate better performance). As shown in Figure 9, increasing the masking ratio initially improves overall performance but eventually degrades it, resulting in an optimal ratio of 30%. We argue that the masking ratio determines the learning dynamics of the corrector: small ratio causes the model to focus more on the reference audio, while high ratio leads the model to consider more of the mixture audio. Striking balance between these factors yields the best perceptual quality and intelligibility for the TSE task. Figure 9: Results of different masking ratios (θ) for the corrector. H.4 Comparison of audio durations SoloSpeech was trained on audio segments of varying lengths, ranging from 3 to 10 seconds. The model also supports longer input thanks to the Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) in the Transformer backbone. In our experiments on Libri2Mix, CHiME-5, and RealSEP, the input segments range from 3 to 20 seconds, and we observe no significant degradation in performance as the input length increases, which is shown in Table 10. This indicates that SoloSpeech is robust to variations in audio duration. Table 9: Comparison of different audio durations.

Without the corrector, there is an obvious mispronunciation in the middle of the speech. Sample II: The corrector effectively reduces artifacts, especially affecting the last phoneme in this speech.
