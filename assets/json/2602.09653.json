            "content": "Healthcare is high stakes domain where language models are increasingly deployed as clinical assistants. Scaling model capacity and medical corpora has driven large gains on knowledge intensive, exam style benchmarks (Yang et al., 2022; Dou et al., 2025). As these gains plateau, the key challenge shifts to aligning open ended responses with clinician preferences and professional standards in real consultations (Fast et al., 2024; Qiu et al., 2025). General RLHF goals such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness are too coarse for clinical use(Johri et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025a), where desired behavior depends on urgency, uncer- *Equal Contribution.

Marker size is proportional to the model parameter count. tainty, and user expertise, motivating fine grained, instance specific rubrics. In response, evaluation is moving from examstyle tests (Zuo et al., 2025) to scenario-grounded assessment. For example, HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025) foregrounds rubric based scoring over realistic prompts, and rubric driven optimization increasingly uses such criteria for training (Fast et al., 2024; Team et al., 2025). However, these efforts have not yet yielded scalable approach to learning from clinician rubric expertise, largely due to scarcity of clinician rubric data and expensive cost of clinician participation. Early efforts such as InfiMed (Wang et al., 2025a) derive evaluation rubrics automatically from benchmark seeds, which can lead to overfitting to the benchmarks and limited generalization across clinical scenarios. RaR-Medicine (Gunjal et al., 2025) primarily focuses on exam-style question answering, without grounding evaluation in real-world physician expertise. In this work, we curate physician supervised preference dataset from real medical queries and multi model responses (Chiang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025c). We drafted candidate rubrics using GPT-5.1, which were then selected, revised, and extended by physicians, resulting in 7,034 physician-verified supervision examples. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on this data raises HealthBench Hard from 5.2% to 22.9%, surpassing GPT-5.1-Instant at 20.8%. However, per instance physician rubric authoring is costly and hard to scale to long tail scenarios. To scale beyond per-instance annotation, we distill recurring rubric patterns into reusable library of scenario-specific consensus rubrics, termed principles. We curate 119 principles with physicians, organized by urgency, uncertainty, user expertise, and task type. These principles enable rubricgrounded supervision for new real-world questions at scale, adding 16,872 examples, and are further packaged as an alignment tool that provides rubric references for inference-time selfrevision. As shown in Figure 1, our models favorably against both openand closed-source baselines on HealthBench-hard (Arora et al., 2025) and Arena-Hard-v2 (Chiang et al., 2024), demonstrating strong cross-benchmark performance without increasing model size. Our main contributions are threefold. (i) We introduce HealthRubrics, physician-verified dataset of 7,034 examples, constructed by having clinicians select, edit, and extend LLM-drafted instance-level rubrics, and demonstrate its effectiveness for alignment training; the dataset will be publicly released upon paper acceptance. (ii) We propose HealthPrinciples, set of 119 reusable principles for scalable synthetic data generation, enabling models to outperform substantially larger commercial and open source systems on both HealthBench-Hard and Arena-Hard-v2. (iii) We develop principle-driven self-revision mechanism for inference, achieving consistent improvements through online rubric-guided refinement."

            "content": "to Clinical Agents From Medical LLMs Progress in large language models has advanced healthcare along two complementary directions. On the modeling side, both proprietary and open medical LLMs have achieved strong performance on knowledge-intensive evaluations, covering standardized exams, unstructured clinical text (Yang et al., 2022), Chinese medical corpora (Wang et al., 2025b), and lightweight task-oriented designs (Wang et al., 2024b). Reinforcement learning further improves medical adaptation and reasoning (Dou et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024). On the systems side, agentic clinical assistants extend beyond single-turn generation via multi-step reasoning, tool-augmented interaction (Zhao et al., 2025), and integration with structured medical resources, enabling applications such as differential diagnosis (Qiu et al., 2025) and radiology reporting (Oh et al., 2024). Despite these advances, aligning openended responses with clinician preferences and professional standards across diverse clinical contexts remains underexplored. We address this gap with practical data and method baselines for fine-grained clinician preference alignment. Towards Rubric Evaluations Medical LLM evaluation has moved beyond multiple-choice knowledge tests toward scenario-grounded assessment, as early benchmarks are easy to score but fail to capture critical consultation behaviors such as long-form reasoning, communication quality, and safety compliance (Zuo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a). Recent efforts emphasize realworld data and more reliable automated pipelines. LLMEval-Med (Zhang et al., 2025) derives cases from EHRs and expert-designed scenarios, combining expert checklists with LLM-based judging refined through human agreement. HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025) further scales to realistic health conversations for both lay users and clinicians, using example-specific rubrics and multiaxis scoring to evaluate long responses and diverse behaviors. However, these approaches remain largely evaluation-centric: rubrics and checklists are rarely reused as supervision for training, limiting scalable preference alignment. Rubric RL Rubric based evaluation decomposes complex goals into verifiable criteria, providing structured and interpretable supervision across domains (Scale, 2025; Lin et al., 2024; Starace et al., 2025; Fast et al., 2024). Recent work uses rubrics as reward or preference signals, often with LLM graders (Team et al., 2025), and sometimes incorporates rubric guidance into rollout and policy learning (Gunjal et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025b; Jayalath et al., 2025). These approaches face recurring challenges, including objective conflicts and reward hacking from poorly constrained rubrics, and high cost and instability from online judging (Eisenstein et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2025). In healthcare, follow up work extends rubric scoring from evaluation to training, including incremental RL for medical dialogue (Wang et al., 2025a; Gunjal et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025). Self refinement methods provide complementary self feedback signals, and interactive diagnostic agents use physician validated rubrics to evaluate diagnostic trajectories (Qiu et al., 2025; Figure 2: Method overview. (Top) HealthRubrics: we draft rubrics with GPT-5.1 for real-world medical queries and multi-model responses, then have physicians refine them into validated preference supervision. (Bottom) HealthPrinciples: we distill recurring rubric patterns into reusable, scenario-specific principles, used to (i) scale rubric-grounded supervision to new questions and (ii) provide rubric references for inference-time self-revision. Zhou et al., 2025c). However, existing pipelines either rely heavily on online judges or produce rubrics that are difficult to reuse across scenarios. Our work is distinguished by physician supervised rubrics and reusable consensus principles that support both scalable offline training and rubric referencing at test time."

In this section, we examine whether vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can achieve such alignment, using HealthBench as the evaluation benchmark. Settings. We ask basic question: Can SFT achieve fine-grained healthcare alignment? We randomly split HealthBench into 3,000 training questions and 2,000 held-out questions. To construct SFT data, we use strong contemporary LLM, GPT-5.1, to generate three rubric-aware responses per training question, conditioned on the question, the rubrics, model draft, and the clinician ideal completion. This yields 9,000 training instances; the prompt template is provided in Appendix A. We then fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct for two epochs using AdamW with learning rate of 1 105, cosine schedule with 3% warmup, and global batch size of 64. Figure 3: HealthBench scores vs. training epoch on random 70/30 split with 3K training questions and 2K held-out questions, evaluated using the official HealthBench script. Results Figure 3 shows that training performance rises from 41.3% to about 52% and largely plateaus after the first epoch. In contrast, held-out performance fluctuates and shows no sustained improvement. Overall, this pilot indicates that naive SFT hits ceiling quickly and does not generalize reliably to unseen questions. Finding 1. Generalization Failure of Naive SFT Naive SFT quickly saturates, memorizing rubrics without achieving reliable generalization. This generalization gap motivates more generalizable supervision, especially rubric RL using instance-conditioned, scenario-aware criteria providing the necessary fine-grained rewarding."

We aggregate preference data from Chatbot Arena, including human-140k1, human-55k2, and expert-5k3, which were released throughout 2025 and therefore cover strong contemporary models. We further incorporate HelpSteer3-Preference (Wang et al., 2025c), whose prompts are sourced from user contributed ShareGPT4 and WildChat-1M (Zhao et al., 2024). In total, this yields 103,575 queries with paired candidate responses. To focus on healthcare, GPT-5.1 classifies each query into medical versus nonmedical categories under fixed taxonomy. This filtering produces 7,034 medical preference instances. Additional details of the classification protocol are provided in Appendix B. Physician Preference Consensus.

To obtain clinically grounded supervision, we collect physician re-labels for each response pair, with every instance independently annotated three times. Physician agreement is higher than agreement with the original user labels, reflecting systematic differences between clinical and lay preferences. Physicians unanimously agree on 55.2% of instances, while the rest show two-to-one split. Consistency is moderate by kappa, with pairwise values from 0.42 to 0.51 and an overall three-annotator value of 0.47. In contrast, physician match rates with user labels are lower at 0.60 to 0.64. We therefore take majority vote over the three physician labels as the clinician consensus preference. Conditioned on this consensus and the paired responses, GPT-5.1 drafts per-instance rubric items using the prompt in Figure 4. Iterative Rubric Refinement. Draft rubrics are finalized through two-stage physician workflow. An assigned physician first reviews the draft and provides revision suggestions by flagging incorrect items, clarifying ambiguous criteria, and identifying missing clinically relevant checks.

Moreover, many physician edits go beyond factual corrections, repeatedly reflecting scenario-dependent reasoning, safety emphasis, and communication preferences. We therefore distill these recurring patterns into HealthPrinciples: compact, human-readable guidance that captures what matters in given clinical context and can be reused to generate rubrics for new questions without direct physician authorship. Taxonomy Design. To make principles reusable and composable, we develop top-down taxonomy with physicians that captures how clinical evaluation varies with context, as summarized in Table 2. The taxonomy has four dimensions: urgency, uncertainty, user expertise, and task type. Urgency has three levels: non-emergent, conditionally emergent, and emergent. Uncertainty is grouped into sufficient information, reducible User uncertainty, and irreducible uncertainty. Category Subcategory Urgency Non-Emergent (routine concern, no immediate safety risk); Conditionally Emergent (cannot rule out important risk; needs key details); Emergent (clear high-risk feature; immediate protective action) #Sub / #P 3 / 13 Example (Conditionally emergent): Communicate potential seriousness using calm, non-alarmist language; give ordered next steps: stop unsafe exposure, do low-risk actions now, avoid harms, monitor symptoms, and specify when/where to seek in-person or emergency care. Uncertainty Sufficient information (key info already present); Reducible uncertainty (missing details can be clarified in dialogue); Irreducible uncertainty (needs exam/measurement/testing in person) 3 / 8 Example (Irreducible uncertainty): For serious/complex topics, explicitly state limits (no exam/testing), avoid definitive diagnosis/prognosis/dosing, and offer concrete low-risk way to reduce uncertainty (appropriate clinician/tests; when to seek urgent evaluation). Expertise Non-professional (layperson/general public); Professional (formal training; professional framing/terminology) 2 / 10 Example (Non-professional): Follow explicit user instructions on language, format, length, and scope. Stay on task and avoid unnecessary digressions. Task Type Emergency triage and escalation; Symptom checks and possible causes; Home care and monitoring plans; Medication and supplement safety, including interactions; Choosing tests and understanding results; Procedure and perioperative guidance; Long-term chronic care planning; Prevention, screening, and vaccines; Sexual and reproductive health counseling; Pregnancy and perinatal guidance; Mental health support and coping; Substance use harm reduction; Rehab and return-to-work or return-to-sport planning; Health education and concept explanations; Exam-style knowledge checks; Medical writing, editing, and translation; Clinical note and document drafting; Patient-facing message drafting; Care navigation and referrals; Insurance and administrative support; Non-medical requests. 21 / 88 Example (Insurance and administrative support): Clearly distinguish what is legally required from common industry practice.

Arena-Hard-v2 (Li et al., 2024) includes 500 challenging real-world prompts curated by BenchBuilder and is widely used as an automatic openended evaluation proxy, showing strong correlation with Chatbot Arena. Training Data and Rubric Variants. As described in Section 4, we sample 7,034 medical questions from the medical portions of Chatbot Arena and HelpSteer3-Preference (Wang et al., 2025c) and construct three rubric supervision variants for each question. As described in Section 4.1, Draft Rubrics are generated automatically and Doctor Rubrics are revised by physicians, while Section 4.2 introduces Principle Rubrics which extract matched HealthPrinciples and convert them into question-specific rubric items. To leverage the scalability of principles, we additionally collect 16,872 medical questions from UltraMedical-Preference (Zhang et al., 2024) using the ChatDoctor (Li et al., 2023) and MedQuAD (Abacha and Fushman, 2019) subsets and generate Principle Rubrics for all of them. All training questions are real user medical queries from online platforms, which we intentionally choose to minimize human-introduced bias and better reflect real-world user needs. Baseline Models. We compare against ten strong baselines, including open models DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2026), Qwen3-235BInstruct, and Qwen3-32B (Yang et al., 2025), proprietary frontier models o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Pro (Comanici et al., 2025), and GPT4.1 (OpenAI et al., 2024), and medical-domain models Baichuan-M2 (Dou et al., 2025) and HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen et al., 2024).

Expert-verfied Rubrics Rubric conditioned RL remains effective under automatically generated supervision. Training with Draft Rubrics yields strong gains over models across benchmarks, consistent with the pilot results in Section 3 and showing that rubric based rewards provide learnable and generalizable signal. Doctor Rubrics further improve over Draft Rubrics, with the largest gains on HealthBench in both Hard and Overall settings and on Arena-Hard-v2. This gap suggests that physician edits remove ambiguity and fix mis specified criteria, producing higher fidelity rewards and better policy updates. Doctor supervision also makes safety critical behaviors such as triage and escalation more consistent and reduces reward hacking driven by vague rubric items, which together explains the stronger overall gains. From Rubrics to Principles Principle Rubrics are competitive with physician edited rubrics even without additional scaling. Trained on the same 7,034 questions, they match and sometimes slightly exceed Doctor Rubrics, suggesting that the extracted HealthPrinciples capture transferable evaluation structure rather than dataset specific artifacts. key factor is coverage. Principle retrieval pools recurring requirements across semantically similar questions, so the rubric for given query typically spans more facets such as risk assessment, uncertainty handling, and actionable next steps than purely question local rubric. Scaling principles to more questions further improves results. More Query Rubrics add principle generated rubrics for 16,872 real user medical queries and deliver broad gains on HealthBench and Arena-Hard-v2. This pattern is consistent with greater robustness from diversified and scenario matched supervision. From Medical Alignment to General Usefulness Although training optimizes medical rubric rewards, gains transfer to the open ended ArenaHard-v2 setting. This suggests that rubric grounding strengthens general instruction following behaviors such as tracking user intent, organizing Figure 8: Tool-call Scaling on HealthBench-hard. actionable guidance, and communicating limitations appropriately. In contrast, explicitly reasoning heavy metrics such as LLMEval-Med Reasoning change little, indicating that rubric aligned training mainly improves helpfulness and safety rather than problem solving depth. promising next step is to combine rubric based RL with objectives that more directly train multi step reasoning, with the goal of improving both alignment and reasoning. Inference-time Scaling Figure 8 shows that allowing multiple inference-time calls to our rubricguidance tool consistently improves HealthBenchhard performance across backbones, even without any specific training, indicating that extracted principles and generated rubrics provide actionable revision signals at test time. Performance increases with more iterations but gradually saturates after few calls, suggesting diminishing returns once major rubric mismatches are corrected and the remaining errors are harder to fix through further rubric feedback alone."

            "content": "Question Scaling with Fixed Budget Under fixed compute budget, this subsection evaluates how performance scales with question coverage. Following Section 5.1, we randomly subsample 1k, 2.5k, 5k, 10k, and 20k questions from the full training pool. Training FLOPs are held constant by matching each run to training on 20k questions for two epochs, so smaller datasets are trained for proportionally more epochs, such as four for 10k and eight for 5k. For each setting, we evaluate the best checkpoint on HealthBench-hard. Figure 9 shows monotonic improvement as the number of distinct questions increases. The gains are largest from 1k to 5k and remain positive up to 20k, with diminishing returns at larger scales. This Figure 9: Question scaling on HealthBench-hard under fixed training-FLOPs budget with Qwen3-4B-Instruct. indicates that rubric-based RL benefits more from supervision diversity than from additional epochs on narrow prompt set, likely because broader coverage better spans clinical intents, risk profiles, and failure modes. Overall, scaling is most effective by increasing the number of training questions. Rubrics Scoring Model Choice To select an efficient and accurate rubric-satisfaction scorer, we randomly sample 1,000 HealthBench questions and evaluate model answers from both training and evaluation, yielding 11,446 rubric judgments. Treating the HealthBench protocol with GPT-4.1 as the reference, we measure Qwen3 scoring accuracy, which increases with model scale: Qwen3-4B, 14B, 32B, and 235B achieve 76.4%, 80.2%, 87.6%, and 87.9%, respectively. Given the negligible gain from 32B to 235B, we use Qwen3-32B as our default scorer for the best accuracyefficiency trade-off."

            "content": "In this work, we addressed the challenge of aligning medical language models with fine-grained standard. We introduced robust framework anchored by HealthRubrics, physician-verified dataset, and HealthPrinciples, reusable taxonomy that distills expert consensus for scalable supervision. Through three progressive strategies: learning on validated data, scaling via principle-synthesized rubrics, and inference-time guidance, we demonstrated that such an alignment enables models to surpass frontier proprietary systems. These findings suggest that incorporating structured clinical logic is as effective as scaling model parameters for specialized tasks. By releasing our data, principles, and tool, we provide practical, resource-efficient foundation to accelerate future research into safe and reliable healthcare AI."

            "content": "Despite the overall gains, we identify two key limitations. First, the proposed method does not yield substantial improvement in intrinsic reasoning in our experiments. Although it helps the model produce better answers in some cases, the gains on multi-step reasoning tasks are not consistently significant. This suggests that the method primarily improves response quality by leveraging external signals more effectively, rather than fundamentally strengthening internal reasoning, and leaves room for further refinement through more targeted supervision and tighter integration between reasoning and tool use. Second, as inference-time scaling strategy, the benefits saturate quickly. Increasing tool usage or sampling beyond certain point produces diminishing returns, indicating that simply scaling inference-time tool calls is unlikely to deliver sustained improvements. promising direction is to train more agentic model that can plan, decide when to invoke tools, and coordinate tool use more effectively, enabling better credit assignment and more efficient inference-time computation.

Table 2 in the main text presents compact view; here we detail every subcategory and describe how the task-type inventory was induced from data with physician input. C.1 Urgency Non-emergent. No immediate safety threat is suggested; the query concerns routine health issues or general information and typically does not require time-sensitive action. Conditionally emergent. Time-sensitive risk cannot be ruled out from the given information; urgency depends on missing key details. The response should ask targeted clarifying questions and provide conditional escalation guidance with clear red flags. Emergent. The query indicates high-risk features or an immediate safety threat and warrants prompt protective action and escalation guidance. C.2 Uncertainty Sufficient information. The question includes the key details needed to give safe and effective guidance; no essential clarifications are required to proceed. Reducible uncertainty. Important details are missing or ambiguous but can be obtained through follow-up questions in dialogue. Irreducible uncertainty. The uncertainty cannot be resolved remotely and requires examination, objective measurement, diagnostic testing, or in-person professional evaluation. C.3 User expertise Non-professional. The user is layperson or general public; responses should prioritize plain language and explicit actionability. Professional. The user indicates relevant formal training or uses professional framing and terminology; responses may use technical language while maintaining safety. C.4 Task Type Inventory Each query is assigned primary task and an optional secondary task. Task types are designed to be readable labels aligned with Table 2; we avoid underscored identifiers in the paper text. Task type induction. We do not pre-specify Instead, we first ask GPT-5.1 task taxonomy. to freely summarize the primary and secondary task implied by each query in short natural language. We then cluster these task summaries using GPT-5.1 to propose multiple candidate clusterings at different granularities. Finally, physicians review the candidates, reconcile ambiguous boundaries, and select 21-category inventory that best matches clinical practice and dataset coverage. During this process, physicians additionally introduced the task family Procedure and perioperative guidance, which was under-represented in early modelgenerated clusterings but frequently appeared in real patient questions and clinician feedback. Free-form task extraction prompt. Figure 12 shows the template used to extract primary and secondary tasks before clustering. Final task families and definitions. Below are the 21 task families used in this work. Emergency triage and escalation. Assess whether an emergency or time-sensitive risk is present and whether immediate escalation is required, and specify clear red flags and time windows for seeking care. Response considerations: prioritize high-yield red flags and explicit timelines; avoid undue alarm or false reassurance; default to conservative in-person evaluation when key information is missing. Symptom assessment and differential considerations. Provide an initial assessment based on symptoms and history, outline plausible etiologies, and identify missing information that would change risk or management. Response considerations: distinguish common versus high-risk causes and state rationale; ask targeted clarifying questions; avoid presenting possibilities as definitive diagnosis. Self-care, monitoring, and follow-up. Offer home-care and self-management guidance and define thresholds and time windows for follow-up, reassessment, strategy changes, or escalation. Response considerations: provide actionable steps and measurable targets; specify stop rules and escalation triggers; avoid high-risk procedures. Medication and supplement safety. Provide general guidance on medication or supplement use with emphasis on interactions, adverse effects, contraindications, and when professional confirmation is needed. Response considerations: account for comorbidities, pregnancy, renal or hepatic impairment, and concomitant drugs; avoid prescribing-level dosing or substitution directives. Diagnostics and test interpretation. Discuss test selection and interpretation, address limitations, and provide results-contingent next steps such as repeat testing, additional workup, referral, or observation. Response considerations: explain reference ranges and false positives or negatives; avoid definitive conclusions from isolated values. Procedure and perioperative guidance. Provide peri-procedural and perioperative guidance, including preparation, recovery, complication recognition, and relevant follow-up milestones. Response considerations: emphasize warning signs and return precautions; avoid clinician-specific instructions that require the procedural or anesthesia team; reinforce individualized discharge instructions. Chronic disease management. Describe long-term management framework including goals, monitoring cadence, lifestyle and pharmacologic strategies, complication prevention, and self-management. Response considerations: present structured plan; emphasize adherence and longitudinal follow-up; avoid one-size-fits-all targets or unsupervised medication changes. Prevention, screening, and vaccines. Provide prevention and risk-reduction guidance including vaccination, screening, health behaviors, and post-exposure actions. Response considerations: specify eligibility, contraindications, and time windows; note guideline and local variation; avoid absolute guarantees. Sexual and reproductive health counseling. Provide education and counseling on sexual health, contraception, sexual function, and common concerns. Response considerations: use nonjudgmental language; address STI risk and testing; include escalation criteria for severe pain, heavy bleeding, and safety concerns. Pregnancy and perinatal care. Address pregnancy and perinatal health issues including symptom evaluation, antenatal pathways, medication and lifestyle considerations, and postpartum recovery. Response considerations: use conservative safety thresholds; flag medications needing obstetric confirmation; state key triggers such as bleeding and hypertensive symptoms. Mental health support. Provide mental health information and support, risk identification, and guidance on when to seek professional or emergency help. Response considerations: prioritize self-harm or violence risk screening and crisis pathways; avoid substituting for professional diagnosis. Substance use harm reduction. Provide counseling using harm-reduction approach including withdrawal and relapse considerations and referral indications. Response considerations: avoid actionable details that facilitate misuse; highlight overdose and withdrawal warning signs; maintain supportive language. Rehabilitation and return to activity. Support rehabilitation and functional recovery with graded plans, restrictions, milestones, and reassessment points for return to sport, work, or school. Response considerations: define stop rules; provide measurable progression; specify contraindications. Health education and general explanations. Provide accessible explanations of biomedical concepts and terminology. Response considerations: use layered explanations; communicate uncertainty; avoid drifting into individualized clinical advice. Knowledge check and exam preparation. Support clinicianor exam-oriented questions with structured takeaways and workflows. Response considerations: note regional guideline variability; avoid fabricating guideline details when uncertain. Medical writing, editing, and translation. Support medical or scientific writing and translation with terminology consistency and appropriate register. Response considerations: preserve meaning without inventing results or citations; flag ambiguous source phrasing. Clinical documentation drafting. Draft professional clinical records such as SOAP notes, referral letters, or discharge summaries. Response considerations: prioritize objective, time-anchored facts and traceable assessment and plan; protect privacy. Patient-facing communication and wording. Develop patientor public-facing materials emphasizing clarity, tone, and actionable guidance. Response considerations: use plain language; communicate uncertainty; avoid absolutes. Care navigation and referrals. Provide guidance on which service to contact, how to prepare for visits, and follow-up planning. Response considerations: provide concrete checklists; avoid presenting navigation guidance as diagnostic conclusions. Insurance and administrative processes. Address insurance, certification, and compliance processes where the deliverable is procedural guidance rather than clinical decisionmaking. Response considerations: defer to institutional requirements; avoid facilitating misrepresentation; flag privacy and compliance risks. Non-medical. Queries that do not require clinical reasoning. Response considerations: respond without unnecessary healthcare framing; if hidden health concern emerges, suggest reframing into an appropriate medical task type."

            "content": "This appendix describes how we derive HealthPrinciples from physician-validated rubric items. The extraction pipeline has two stages: (i) Taxonomybased routing of rubric sets into subcategories and (ii) Iterative clustering and compression within each subcategory to produce candidate principles for physician refinement. D.1 Stage I: Mapping rubrics to taxonomy subcategories Each validated rubric set is assigned to one or more taxonomy subcategories. We formulate this as multi-label classification problem over the full set of subcategories across the four taxonomy axes. We use GPT-5.1 with constrained label set and strict JSON output format to ensure routable, consistent outputs. D.2 Stage II: Iterative clustering and compression within each subcategory After routing, each subcategory contains corpus of rubric items. To summarize recurring accompanied by prior dialogue context and/or draft answerthe tool first classifies the scenario and then converts the retrieved principles into context-specific rubric items. In both prompts, subcategory description is instantiated with the taxonomy definitions in Appendix C. Importantly, all classifications and rubric generation are performed by the tools underlying model itself (i.e., without invoking any external models). The tool validates that predicted labels are in-vocabulary before extracting principles. patterns at scale, we apply semantic clustering with iterative compression. We compute rubricitem embeddings using Qwen3-Embedding-8B (L2normalized), cluster them with MiniBatchKMeans, and select representative items by cosine similarity to each cluster centroid. We then ask GPT-5.1 to summarize each cluster into single representative sentence. The resulting candidates are reclustered and re-summarized iteratively until compact set is produced for physician review. Compression schedule. We use fixed compression ratio of 60: each iteration compresses roughly 60 candidate items into 1 representative candidate. We run up to three iterations, enabling hierarchical coverage of up to 60 60 60 items. When the remaining candidate count drops below 100, we directly summarize them into 5 candidates to form manageable set for physician refinement. Summarization constraints. All summarization prompts are in English and require strict JSON outputs, as shown in Figure 14. Candidates are single-sentence, observable, and checkable criteria (i.e., rubric-like statements rather than abstract advice). Physicians subsequently edit and consolidate these candidates into the final HealthPrinciples inventory."

Prompt for Cluster Summarization into Representative Rubric Candidates (template) You are an expert rubric editor for evaluating responses to health/medical questions. Task: Rewrite the input rubric sentences into exactly {k} representative rubric sentences in ENGLISH. Hard requirements: - Output EXACTLY {k} items. - Return ONLY JSON array of exactly {k} strings (no extra text). - Each item MUST be single sentence, self-contained, specific, and checkable by non-expert. - Each item MUST capture distinct recurring requirement; avoid duplicates/overlap. - Each item MUST be written as an observable criterion (e.g., Mentions X, Advises when Z), not an abstract principle (avoid be empathetic/clear/accurate unless tied to concrete observable elements). - Keep each sentence short (preferably 25 words); remove hedging and avoid multi-clause lists unless essential. - Do NOT mention the list, above, these items, files, prompts, or any process. - Do NOT introduce new medical requirements not present in the input. Input rubrics: {joined} Output format (STRICT): Return ONLY JSON array of exactly {k} strings. Figure 14: Prompt used to summarize each rubric-item cluster into exactly representative, rubric-like candidates under strict constraints. Prompt for Taxonomy Classification (template) r\"\"\"You are medical conversation scenario classifier. Input: - question: the users full question (may include multiple turns). Task: Classify the conversation along four independent axes and output labels with one-sentence definitions. Use plain language suitable for non-experts. Urgency: {subcategory description} Uncertainty: {subcategory description} Expertise: {subcategory description} Task Type: {subcategory description} - Assign exactly one primary_task_family capturing the main deliverable/intent, and optionally 02 secondary_task_families for important supporting needs. Output format (STRICT): Return ONLY valid JSON with the following exact top-level schema (no extra keys, no markdown, no surrounding text): { \"scenario\": { \"urgency\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"uncertainty\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"expertise\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"primary_task_family\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"secondary_task_families\": [{\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}], \"description\": \"...\" } } Now generate the output for: question: {{question}} \"\"\".strip() Figure 15: Prompt used to classify each question into taxonomy labels for principle retrieval and rubric generation. Prompt 1: Scenario Classification (with optional dialogue context and draft answer) r\"\"\"You are medical conversation scenario classifier. Inputs (some may be empty): - question: the users question - dialogue_context: prior messages (optional) - draft_answer: candidate answer (optional) Task: Use {question} as the primary signal. If dialogue_context is provided, use it to clarify intent, constraints, and user expertise. If draft_answer is provided, use it only as weak evidence about what the assistant is attempting to do. Classify the scenario along four independent axes and output labels with one-sentence definitions. Use plain language suitable for non-experts. Urgency: {subcategory description} Uncertainty: {subcategory description} Expertise: {subcategory description} Task Type: {subcategory description} - Assign exactly one primary_task_family capturing the main deliverable/intent. - Optionally assign 02 secondary_task_families for important supporting needs. Output format (STRICT): Return ONLY valid JSON with the following exact schema (no extra keys, no markdown, no surrounding text): { \"scenario\": { \"urgency\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"uncertainty\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"expertise\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"primary_task_family\": {\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}, \"secondary_task_families\": [{\"label\": \"...\", \"definition\": \"...\"}], \"description\": \"...\" } } Now generate the output for: question: {{question}} dialogue_context: { {dialogue context} } draft_answer: {{draft answer}} \"\"\".strip() Figure 16: Prompt used to classify question when optional dialogue context and/or draft answer is available. Prompt 2: Convert Retrieved Principles into Context-specific Rubric Items r\"\"\"You are generating scorable rubric items for evaluating medical answer. Inputs: - question: the users question - dialogue_context: prior messages (optional) - draft_answer: candidate answer (optional) - scenario: predicted taxonomy labels - principles: retrieved HealthPrinciples matched to the scenario Task: Convert the retrieved principles into rubric items that are tailored to this specific question and context. If draft_answer is provided, write rubric items that directly help diagnose and revise likely failures in the draft. Hard requirements: - Output rubric items in ENGLISH. - Each rubric item MUST be one sentence, specific, and checkable by non-expert. - Avoid vague style-only advice. - Do NOT add new medical requirements beyond the provided principles and the user context. - Prefer safety-critical items first when urgency is high or uncertainty is irreducible. Output format (STRICT): Return ONLY valid JSON with the following exact schema (no extra keys, no markdown, no surrounding text): { \"rubric_items\": [\"...\", \"...\", \"...\"], \"principle_coverage\": [ {\"principle_id\": \"...\", \"used_in_items\": [0, 2]} ] } Now generate the output for: question: {{question}} dialogue_context: {{dialogue_context}} draft_answer: {{draft_answer}} scenario: {{scenario_json}} principles: {{principles_json}} \"\"\".strip() Figure 17: Prompt used to convert retrieved HealthPrinciples into question-specific rubric items at inference time."
