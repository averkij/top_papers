Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved dramatically in recent years, yet they continue to generate factually inaccurate information. Indeed, factuality remains one of the most critical and challenging aspects of LLMs. Research in this area can be broadly divided into two distinct scenarios: (1) factuality with respect to given context, where models response must be fully grounded in the provided information (e.g., document or an image; Honovich et al., 2022; Jacovi et al., 2025; Rashkin et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2024), and (2) factuality with respect to general world knowledge, where model must accurately answer factoid queries using its internal parameters (Chen et al., 2023; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022) or by using external sources like the web (Mialon et al., 2023; Vu et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024, 2025; Yang et al., 2024). Practical use cases would typically rely on both these capabilities (e.g., analyzing financial reports). While previous works, including our own FACTS Grounding benchmark (Jacovi et al., 2025), each focused on specific capabilities, comprehensive understanding of an LLMs factuality requires evaluating its performance across wider spectrum of tasks.

The FACTS Leaderboard introduced here is designed to address this need by providing holistic evaluation suite. It aggregates performance across four specialized sub-leaderboards, each targeting distinct dimension of factuality. FACTS Multimodal tests models ability to combine visual grounding with world knowledge to answer questions about an image. FACTS Parametric measures the models ability to use its internal knowledge accurately in factoid question use-cases. FACTS Search evaluates the practical and increasingly common use case of generating factual responses by interacting with search tool. FACTS Grounding v2 is an updated version of FACTS Grounding, which tests grounding to given document, with improved judges. By combining these diverse evaluations into single suite, we aim to offer more comprehensive and robust measure of models factual reliability, rather than focusing on narrow set of tasks. In what follows, we introduce the four pillars of the FACTS Leaderboard Suite, detail the methodology for each, and explain the aggregation process that yields single, comprehensive factuality score. We believe this suite offers nuanced and thorough tool for tracking progress in the ongoing challenge of building factually reliable LLMs. 2 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality 2. The FACTS Leaderboard The FACTS suite provides systematic protocol for evaluating LLMs on diverse aspects of factuality. We maintain live leaderboard tracking performance on the four FACTS benchmarks: Multimodal, Parametric, Search, and Grounding. The leaderboard will remain open to new model submissions. To mitigate overfitting, only subset of the prompts will be released publicly, and the remaining prompts will remain private. All model evaluation will be conducted by Kaggle. Detailed metrics for each of the four tasks will be published on dedicated task-specific leaderboards. Since each task measures different aspect of factuality, analyzing them separately yields the most complete insight. However, to facilitate comparison across benchmarks, the main leaderboard will feature single holistic performance metric: the average accuracy across all four tasks, where accuracy per task is the average over the public and private sets. We refer to this metric as the FACTS Score. Table 1 presents the evaluation of proprietary API-based models across the full FACTS benchmark suite (i.e., both private and public sets). For this overview, we report the FACTS Score, as well as the accuracy for each subset, with 95% confidence intervals. In the following sections, we describe the four benchmarks, outlining the dataset construction, defining the tailored metrics, and analyzing benchmark-specific outcomes. 3. FACTS Multimodal The FACTS Multimodal benchmark evaluates the ability of models to generate factually accurate text in response to image-based questions. This task requires the integration of visual grounding with parametric world knowledge, critical capability for modern multimodal systems. The evaluation framework is designed not only to verify the correctness of claims but also to ensure that responses are sufficiently comprehensive to be helpful to the user. 3.1. Data The evaluation set contains approximately 1,500 questions, divided and filtered into 711-item public set and an 811-item private set. Questions were curated from various sources to reflect diverse realworld user queries and were filtered to focus on objective, information-seeking tasks. The benchmark covers range of capabilities, including detailed visual description, data interpretation from charts and graphs, object recognition, and logical reasoning about visual scenes. Figure 1 presents the distribution of image and question categories in the public set. 3.2. Metrics The evaluation produces two primary scores Coverage score and No-Contradiction score determined by an automated judge that evaluates each response against human-authored, groundtruth rubric. This rubric-based methodology is central to our benchmark, as it provides scalable and objective framework for evaluation. Reference Rubric Creation. For each question, human annotators created detailed rubric listing relevant facts. Facts that are critical for complete and satisfactory answer are labeled as Essential, while other relevant, contextual facts are labeled as Non-Essential. This distinction allows for nuanced evaluation of both correctness and substance. Automated Evaluation. An automated judge, acting as meticulous fact-checker, is used to verify the models response is factual using two boolean verdicts: 3 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 2 Examples from the FACTS Multimodal benchmark, illustrating the rubric-based evaluation. The autorater uses the rubric to generate two distinct verdicts for factuality and completeness.

The painting is on white brick wall. Non-essential Facts 5. At the bottom frame... are shrubs... 6. The large sidewalk... allows for space to view the mural... 7. The artists name, Kay Rosen, appears in black text below the mural... Based on the visual details, this is Ferrocarril Sonora-Baja California (SBC) 2203, rare surviving example of an EMD FT diesel-electric locomotive. Here are the key details: Model Introduced: The EMD FT model line was introduced in 1939. Specific Unit History: This specific locomotive was built in 1945 and sold to the Mexican railroad SBC in 1964. It is currently preserved at the National Museum of Mexican Railways in Puebla, Mexico. Based on the visual features, this butterfly belongs to the genus Thymelicus. Here is breakdown of why: Family: It is clearly member of the Hesperiidae family, identifiable by the hooked antennae. Genus Characteristics: The genus Thymelicus is characterized by this specific rusty-orange or goldenbrown coloration. Species differentiation: It is likely either Small Skipper or an Essex Skipper. Both species are common in Europe and parts of the Middle East. This eye-level, outdoor shot captures large, contemporary mural painted on an exterior brick wall. The mural itself is vibrant, sky-blue rectangle featuring the capital letters ABCDEFGHI in bold, sans-serif font. The letters through are rendered in stark white, while the letters and are distinctly painted in vivid yellow, cleverly forming the word HI and drawing attention to this friendly greeting. The artists signature, Kay Rosen, is visible in small white text in the bottom right corner of the blue mural. (... rest of the response) Coverage Verdict 50% Complete Covers 1 of 2 essential facts. Fails to correctly identify the introduction year. Contradiction Verdict final verdict: HAS CLEAR CONTRADICTION(S). reasoning: The response claims the model line was introduced in 1939 and the unit built in 1945, which directly contradicts Fact #2 (introduced in 1949). 0% Complete Covers 0 of 1 essential facts. Fails to identify the correct genus. final verdict: HAS CLEAR CONTRADICTION(S). reasoning: The response identifies the genus as Thymelicus, which contradicts Essential Fact #1 (Racta). Consequently, it provides incorrect species and location information (Europe vs. South America). 100% Complete Covers 4 of 4 essential facts. final verdict: HAS CLEAR CONTRADICTION(S). reasoning: The response states, \"The artists signature... is visible in small white text in the bottom right corner of the blue mural.\" According to Fact #7, the artists name appears in \"black text below the mural.\" The response incorrectly describes the color and location of the signature. Coverage verdict: This boolean verdict verifies that the model response includes the essential facts specified in the ground-truth rubric. No-Contradiction verdict: This boolean verdict verifies that the model response does not include any claims that contradict either the ground-truth rubrics (essential and non-essential), common knowledge or the input image itself. Accuracy score: only responses that both cover essential facts and do not include any contradictions are considered accurate. The overall accuracy score is the percentage of such responses in the set. Table 2 demonstrates this dual-verdict process, showcasing the detailed reasoning the autorater provides to justify its verdicts and the nuances of the errors it can detect. Table 3 presents the results of our main FACTS Multimodal benchmark. The Gemini model family is more recall-oriented than other families, demonstrating high Coverage scores. Conversely, GPT models are more precision-oriented, achieving the highest No-Contradiction Scores. 4 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Figure 1 Distributions of image and question categories in the FACTS Multimodal benchmark. 3.3. Autorater Validation. The credibility of our automated metrics was established by validating them against human groundtruth annotations. For Coverage, the human annotation task mirrored the autoraters function precisely: given model response, human raters marked each essential fact from the rubric as either supported or unsupported. The autorater was tasked with the same objective. This allowed for direct comparison of the final percentage of essential facts supported metric, on which our autorater achieved high degree of reliability with Spearmans rank correlation of 0.64 with human judgments. After applying threshold to convert this to boolean outcome by using threshold of 0.5 to ensure most facts are covered, we obtained macro F1 score of 72.3. For No-Contradiction, we validated the autorater against fine-grained human annotations. The process required comprehensive review of the entire model response; as illustrated in Figure 2, annotators assessed the text sentence-by-sentence, using the interface to mark whether each sentence contained contradiction. This validation achieved macro F1 score of 78.2. Table 4 details these results, where the positive class denotes the absence of contradiction. 5 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 3 Detailed results on the FACTS Multimodal benchmark.

FACTS Parametric The FACTS Parametric benchmark assesses the ability of models to accurately answer factual questions (4.1.1) that users care about, without the aid of external tools. The questions are derived by user-interest, and their answers are confirmed to exist within Wikipedia, source available for LLM pretraining. Each of the questions was found challenging through adversarial sampling with suite of open-source models (see 4.1.2). The resulting benchmark measures how well models can recall challenging facts that users care about and that are supported by primary source. 4.1. Data FACTS Parametric consists of 2104 QA pairs, equally divided into 1052-item public set and 1052-item private set. We verified that the underlying intent of each question reflects widespread user interest. The questions were then subjected to adversarial sampling, and human verification to create reliable and challenging benchmark (see 4.1.2). The resulting queries span broad range of topics, including politics, sports, and technology, while the answer types fall into diverse categories such as people, dates, and places. Figure 3 presents the breakdown of these topics and answer types in the public set, illustrating the distribution of challenging factoid queries as they appear in real-world traffic. Finally, Table 5 presents set of examples from the public dataset. 6 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Figure 2 Example of the sentence-level annotation interface. Annotators are shown the image, the full model-generated paragraph, and highlighted sentence. They assess its factuality by selecting label (here, Contradiction) and providing textual explanation for any inaccuracies observed. 4.1.1. FACTS Parametric properties Questions Reflect User Traffic. One of our goals with FACTS Parametric is to evaluate how familiar models are with facts users genuinely care about. To do this, we collected questions that reflect interest shown by many users. However, since strictly following these guidelines tends to yield highly popular (and therefore easier) topics, we deliberately selected the least frequent topics from the eligible set. We then further refined the list of initial questions using adversarial sampling to ensure we only retained questions that remain challenging for models (see 4.1.2). Answers Explicitly Supported by Prevalent Source. To effectively measure the recall of parametric knowledge acquired during pre-training, we established key criterion for FACTS Parametric: every answer must be explicitly supported by information found within Wikipedia documents. We selected Wikipedia as the mandatory source because its content is highly prevalent and widely assumed to be significant component of the training corpora for all LLMs. This constraint helped ensure that the benchmark evaluates knowledge the model was likely exposed to during training, thereby allowing clearer assessment of its ability to recall factual information learned during that phase, especially when running the assessment with no access to web-search tools. Factoid Criteria. To facilitate straightforward and reliable model assessment, we designed FACTS Parametric with few important properties in mind: Single, Atomic Fact: Each question targets exactly one piece of factual information, avoiding multi-part queries. This ensures that evaluation focuses on recalling one easily verifiable fact. Unambiguous Answer: Questions are designed to have only one distinct, correct answer, minimizing ambiguity during evaluation. Clear Answer Specification: The expected type of answer (e.g., person, location, date) or the required granularity is typically stated in the question itself, or is strongly implied. Concise, Factual Answers: The expected answer is short entity (like name, number, or specific term) rather than simple yes/no response (which the model can guess) or long detailed response. This simplifies matching model outputs to the ground truth. Stable Facts: The benchmark focuses on facts that are either static (e.g., What is the capital of France?) or explicitly time-anchored within the question (e.g., Who was the US president in 1995?), ensuring the stability and longevity of the ground truth answers. 7 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 5 Example questions from the FACTS Parametric benchmark (Public set).

Data Processing To satisfy the structural requirements detailed in 4.1.1 and construct challenging benchmark, we implemented multi-stage filtering pipeline. First, we applied automatic LLM-based filters to the initial set of questions, which were collected to reflect user interest, to identify queries satisfying the factoid criteria above. Next, we utilized an adversarial sampling mechanism to isolate the most challenging examples. Finally, we conducted human verification to confirm adherence to all specified properties. Adversarial Sampling with Open LLMs. While FACTS Parametric is grounded in questions frequently asked by users, key goal is to ensure the benchmark remains challenging for frontier LLMs, avoiding saturation in the near future. To achieve this, we employ an adversarial sampling strategy during the data collection phase. First, we generate preliminary silver labels for all questions using Gemini-2.5-Pro equipped with search tools. In this setup, the model returns both generated answer and the specific search results used to derive it. Since we aim to ground our benchmark in verifiable sources, we filter this set to retain only the questions where the models answer is supported by Wikipedia URL found in the search results. Next, to identify the most challenging questions among this verified set, we collect responses from five strong open-weight models (i.e., models with publicly available weights that can be run locally). We specifically utilized open-weight architectures to decouple the adversarial selection process from the proprietary API models used in our evaluation, thereby ensuring unbiased filtering. Crucially, we query these models in closed-book setting, without access to external search tools. Finally, we retain only the questions that none of these open-weight models answered correctly.1 As final step, this refined list is sent to human annotation for rigorous verification (see below). Human Annotation. To maintain data quality and validity, each question-answer (QA) pair was verified by three independent third-party human annotators. Annotators received the question, the LLM-generated candidate answer (silver label), and supporting URL from the initial data collection. Their role was to confirm the factual accuracy of the QA pair and its compliance with the FACTS Parametric properties detailed in Section 4.1.1. 1At this phase, correctly is defined as matching the silver answer provided by Gemini-2.5-Pro. Note that these are preliminary filters; the final labels are determined later. 8 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Figure 3 Distributions of context domain and of answer type as percent of the total set of questions in the FACTS Parametric benchmark. Specifically, annotators performed the following evaluations for each example: Factuality Assessment: Determine the correctness of the provided answer for the given question. Annotators were explicitly instructed to base their judgment on information available on the web, and not solely on the provided URL. The possible verdicts were: Accurate: The answer is verifiably correct based on accessible online information. Inaccurate: The answer is deemed incorrect due to one of the following reasons: (a) reliable online sources provide contradictory information, (b) no supporting information could be found online, or (c) the topic is disputed, with both supporting and contradicting information found online. Properties Compliance Check: Verify whether the question and answer strictly adhere to all the dataset properties described in Section 4.1.1. The outcome was simple True/False verdict. Wikipedia Evidence Extraction: Identify and provide Wikipedia document that confirms the fact represented by the QA pair. The rater was given Wikipedia URL that might contain the required information, but it had to be checked. When annotators did not find supporting Wikipedia URL, the example was disqualified from appearing in the final dataset. Correction Provision: If QA pair was initially rated as Inaccurate or failed the Properties Compliance Check, but the issue could be resolved with simple correction (to either the question, answer, or URL) without altering the original user intent, annotators were instructed to provide the corrected version. Otherwise, the QA pair was discarded. In the cases where correction was proposed, new annotator was instructed to finalize the examples with proposed correction.

Metrics We follow the grading scheme proposed by Wei et al. (2024) with some modifications. First, we slightly change the examples given in the grader instruction prompt to better represent the scenarios we see in our data. Then, we introduce an additional grading label, unknown, which represents cases where the grader is unsure whether the gold answer and the model response are aligned. We find this label to improve the already high accuracy presented by the grader. Accordingly, the resulting grader automatically grades each model response as either correct, incorrect, not-attempted, or unknown. Our primary metric is accuracy, which is measured by the percentage of correct responses. We also report three secondary metrics: Hedging rate (the percentage of not-attempted), attempted-accuracy, and F1-score, the harmonic mean of accuracy and accuracy given attempted. To enhance grading reliability, we sample three grades from Gemini-2.5-Pro for each query, goldanswer, response triplet and average them to determine the final score. We observed that utilizing powerful model for grading improves grading accuracy. We ultimately decided to standardize on Gemini-2.5-Pro as our sole judge to keep the benchmark simple and easy to maintain. We validated this choice by comparing it against mixed-model panel (sampling once each from Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-o3, and Grok-4). The results confirmed that using Gemini-2.5-Pro alone preserves the same relative performance trends and rankings as the more complex ensemble. Table 6 presents the main results for the FACTS-parametric benchmark. For all metrics, we report the average score derived from three sampled grades per model response. These results illuminate model behavior regarding uncertainty: while guessing is the optimal strategy for standard accuracy, the attempted-accuracy metric incentivizes hedging. This trade-off is evident when comparing GPT-o3 and GPT-5. Although GPT-o3 achieves higher raw accuracy (57.0% vs. 55.7%), GPT-5 hedges significantly more often (13.3% of cases vs. 1.9%). Consequently, GPT-5 achieves superior attempted accuracy (64.3% vs. 58.2%) and F1 scores (59.7 vs. 57.6). 10 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 7 Examples from FACTS Search (Public set).

FACTS Search The FACTS Search benchmark evaluates the ability of models to use web search. Indeed, most recent generative models are designed to make use of search tool, and several benchmarks have been proposed to test this capability (e.g., see Wei et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024). The key challenge when designing such benchmarks is to collect questions whose solution requires search tools. Generally, the only case where this is guaranteed is when the information sought by the question does not appear in the model training data, and does appear in the search results. However, this is hard to guarantee across models (whose training data and cutoff dates are different), and thus we do not pursue this direction. Instead, we focus on other aspects that are hard for models that do not have access to web search. These include tail-entities which are often not sufficiently encoded in parameters, and multi-hop queries (where its less likely that all hops are encoded in the parameters). 5.1. Data The evaluation set contains 1884 questions, which are split into public and private test sets, of sizes 890 and 994 respectively. The questions were collected from various sources, with the goal of capturing diverse aspects of queries that are likely to require search. Table 7 shows some examples from the dataset. The set of questions consists of four subsets, each generated using different strategy. One subset was written by human raters, and the other three were synthetically generated. See details below. Hard Tail : set of questions written by human raters as follows. The raters were instructed to write questions that require information that is challenging to extract with web search. Namely, that there is no single-step web search answer available on the first page, or the information is not readily available as verbatim piece of text on the internet. Raters were also asked to verify that the Gemini model publicly available at the time (Gemini 1.5) could not solve these, even when using search. Wiki Two-Hop - set of question-answer pairs, synthetically generated using Wikipedia as follows. An initial set of QA pairs was extracted from Wikipedia abstracts, and filtered to focus on tail entities. Next, each question was modified to be harder, multi-step question via synthetic alteration. This was achieved by substituting the main entity of the question with different description of this entity that is extracted from the Google Knowledge Graph. For example, The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 8 Detailed results on the FACTS Search benchmark.

These questions were not adversarially filtered, but evaluation on Search-Off and Search-On Gemini models available at the time gave low accuracies of 30% and 38%. Wiki Multi-Doc - set of question-answer pairs synthetically generated from multiple Wikipedia documents as follows. First, seed document 𝐷𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 was sampled. Then, it was used to sample set of similar documents 𝐷𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑, and only the documents 𝐷𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑜 with rank that is neither too low nor too high are kept.2 Finally, Gemini was prompted to synthesize query-answer pair (𝑄, 𝐴) from the content of these 𝑛 documents. The query 𝑄 was formulated to be answerable only by synthesizing information present in both the seed document 𝐷𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 and one or more documents from the 𝐷𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑜 subset. The prompt also encouraged Gemini to find interesting ways to connect information rather than relying on simple direct chain or combination of unrelated queries. Next, questions were filtered as follows. First, an automated critic model filtered out pairs where the question was not self-contained or the answer was not strictly grounded in the source documents. Second, hardness filter was applied, discarding any queries that Gemini could correctly answer when utilizing standard web search tools. KG Hops - set of question-answer pairs synthetically generated using multiple hops in the Google Knowledge Graph. To generate these, we first collected common path-queries, such as films that actor appeared in. These queries were then concatenated and combined with other functions (e.g., max) to create more complex ones. For example, films that actor appeared in and publication date of film could be combined to create publication date of the first film that actor appeared in. The collection process above resulted in set of questions with corresponding gold answers, either written by human raters or extracted automatically as part of the data generated process. In order to further check the quality of the answer for all questions, three independent human raters were asked to rate each question and answer according to the following criteria: Correctness: Use Google search to check that the provided answer is correct response to the question. Uniqueness: Check whether there are entities different and distinct from the provided answer that could also be correct answers to the given question. Immutability: Identify whether the answer to the given query is likely to change in the next five years. 2This eliminates documents that are too similar or too distant from 𝐷𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑. 12 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 9 Examples from FACTS Grounding v1 (Public set).

Please summarize outcomes across the three kinds of complications that the researchers studied. The dataset was filtered to include only questions that all three raters marked as correct, unique and immutable. Finally, all questions were filtered to exclude those that Gemini 2.5 Flash without search answered correctly, thus emphasizing the need for search tool. The resulting final dataset sizes were 328, 932, 268, 356 for Hard Tail,Wiki Two-Hop,Wiki Multi-Doc, and KG Hops respectively. 5.2. Search Engine The goal of the FACTS Search benchmark is to evaluate how well LLMs use search tools. Because performance relies heavily on the specific tool used, meaningful comparison requires that all models access the same search engine. The FACTS leaderboard evaluation uses the Brave Search API as the search tool. All evaluated models receive the same description of the tool. When an LLM triggers tool call, the API is queried, and the output is appended to the LLM context. 5.3. Metrics To evaluate the quality of model responses, we use prompted auto-rater. Specifically, given query, model response, and gold response, Gemini 2.0 Flash is prompted to assess if the response is correct, incorrect or does not attempt to answer the query. Table 8 presents our main FACTS Search results. Notably, Gemini 3 Pro, the highest-performing model, conducts fewer searches on average than other top models, whereas the Grok model family searches the most. Consistent with observations in the FACTS Parametric slice, Claude appears to prioritize accuracy on attempted queries over overall accuracy.

FACTS Grounding v2 The FACTS Grounding v2 benchmark extends the FACTS Grounding benchmark (referred to as FACTS Grounding v1 below) previously introduced in Jacovi et al. (2025). FACTS Grounding v1 evaluated whether model response is consistent with the given context document and user query about that document. Here we briefly re-introduce FACTS Grounding v1, and then describe the new version, in which the judge models were updated. Please refer to Jacovi et al. (2025) for more details about the original FACTS Grounding leaderboard. 6.1. Data The set of prompts for FACTS Grounding v2 is the same as v1. We provide description below for completeness. Third-party human raters were instructed to design prompts requiring the processing of long-form input and the writing of long-form output. These tasks include Q&A, summarization, and document rewriting. Each example within our evaluation set consists of context, which is document or set of reviews sourced from the web, paired with non-trivial user request that can be addressed using the provided context, necessitating long-form response. Additionally, each example includes system instruction directing the model to generate its response exclusively from the given context, without incorporating external knowledge. To ensure the diversity of the evaluation set, prompts were generated across range of document lengths (up to 32k tokens) and various enterprise domains, including finance, technology, retail, medical, and legal. The annotation instructions were carefully designed to avoid prompts requiring creative responses, expert-level domain knowledge, mathematical or logical reasoning, or metaanalysis of the text, such as tone analysis or interpretation of author intent. Table 9 provides concrete examples of data instances in the collection. The specific distributions of enterprise domains and of tasks requested by users are shown in Figure 4. 14 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 10 Evaluation of different judge models and evaluation prompts on private test-set (N=320, class ratio 79:19).

Metrics We keep the same evaluation approach as in FACTS Grounding v1 (Jacovi et al., 2025). Specifically, we first prompt multiple judge LLMs to determine if the response is grounded in the input. Finally, we find ineligible responses that do not sufficiently address the user request, and mark these as inaccurate, so only grounded and eligible responses are labeled as accurate. The main updates in FACTS Grounding v2 are the LLMs used as judges, and the prompt used. See details below. Unadjusted Factuality Score. As in FACTS Grounding v1, the principal component of our evaluation process is an unadjusted factuality score, which is the initial score before the adjustment for ineligible responses (described later). First, we utilize language model judge to produce binary classification label identifying whether full model response is grounded in the user request and the context document given an instruction (see Table 9). model response is marked with positive label (accurate) if all the claims in the response are grounded in the contents of the prompt, or do not require grounding; the response is marked with negative label (not accurate) if at least one claim that bears information is deemed to be not grounded in the contents of the prompt. We use two different judge models in order to reduce the bias of particular judge model, as models have been shown to be biased towards favorably judging their own outputs (Wataoka et al., 2024). The judge models are Gemini 2.5 Flash (Comanici et al., 2025) and GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025). We note that FACTS Grounding v1 used different set of models: Gemini 1.5 Pro (Gemini Team: R. Anil et al., 2023), GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024). To evaluate the quality of the new judge models, we compared them to human-ratings on heldout evaluation set (N=320). We also investigated changes to the judge prompt templates. Specifically, we considered two prompt variants: the one from FACTS Grounding v1, and slightly modified version v2. Results are shown in Table 10, and demonstrate that the new models combined with the v2 prompt outperform other model-prompt combinations. Given the two judges, the individual factuality score for each judge is the percentage of accurate responses, and the unadjusted factuality score is the average of all judge scores. Disqualifying Ineligible Responses. Metrics that are focused on evaluating the factuality of the generated text with respect to context document can be hacked by ignoring user intent. Namely, by providing shorter responses that evade conveying adequately comprehensive information, even if such content was an important aspect of user request, it is possible to achieve high factuality score while not providing helpful response. See illustrative examples in Table 11. 15 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality Table 11 Examples of ineligible responses: these responses, while fully grounded in the context document, fail to address the user request meaningfully and are consequently considered ineligible."

(1) The response provides no substantive information on the causes, such as stock market speculation, bank failures, or trade policies, which were discussed in the document. (2) It ignores the users explicit focus on the \"main causes.\" We safeguard against such responses by using prompted judge LLMs to determine whether given generated response sufficiently addresses the users request. The judge LLM is asked to output binary label indicating the eligibility of the response: either eligible, signifying that it answers the user request, or ineligible, otherwise. Ineligible responses are disqualified from factuality evaluation and the final factuality score is adjusted such that ineligible responses are deemed as inaccurate. The judge models used are the same two models used for checking grounding. 7. Conclusion As LLMs improve, existing benchmarks become saturated. It is thus important to introduce benchmarks that challenge current models. Here, we present the FACTS suite, benchmark where the top performing model has an average accuracy of only 69%, leaving considerable headroom for future progress. The FACTS leaderboard results report high-level metrics such as accuracy. However, it will be useful to obtain more fine-grained analysis, studying what affects the hardness of questions. For example, previous work (Kandpal et al., 2023) has shown that infrequent entities are harder to learn, and it would be interesting to check if this is reflected in FACTS Parametric. Similarly, it would be interesting to study notions of tailness for FACTS Search, where some facts might be harder to search for than others. Each of the FACTS subsets requires different capabilities to solve, and can serve to drive research on these fronts. FACTS Multimodal requires integration of image understanding with knowledge not represented in the image; FACTS Parametric relies on representing broad factual knowledge in the model parameters, FACTS Search involves effective use of search tools, and FACTS Grounding focuses on the ability to ground the response to context. These are all facets of factuality, where the model relies on different sources of information to generate factual responses. Naturally, there are aspects of factuality not covered by FACTS, such as video understanding and fast-changing information. In addition, tool-use introduces new factuality challenges, for example when using knowledge-base calls as tool. We hope FACTS will inspire additional benchmarks that address these areas and others. 16 The FACTS Leaderboard: Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality 8.
