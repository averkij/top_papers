            "content": "In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [60, 137, 246, 36, 35, 248, 140, 228, 192, 275, 143, 54, 170] have emerged as pivotal technology in artificial intelligence, capable of processing and understanding information from multiple modalities such as text, images, and videos. These models promise breakthroughs across fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. However, developing large-scale MLLMs remains challenging task, requiring significant computational resources, sophisticated architectures, and the ability to effectively integrate diverse data types in scalable manner. Various attempts have been made to address these challenges, including enhancing model architectures [220, 232, 5, 172, 157, 210], scaling vision encoders [252, 66, 36, 293, 185] and language models [231, 235, 64, 19, 229, 221, 62], incorporating more diverse and high-quality datasets [124, 234, 25, 155], and refining the test-time scaling process [215, 249, 230] to boost performance. Notable commercial models, like GPT-4o [192] * equal contribution; interns at OpenGVLab, Shanghai AI Laboratory; (cid:66) corresponding authors (daijifeng@tsinghua.edu.cn, wangwenhai@pjlab.org.cn). Figure 1: Performance of various MLLMs on the OpenCompass leaderboard. InternVL 2.5 showcases strong multimodal capabilities, rivaling closed-source models like GPT-4o [192] and Claude-3.5-Sonnet [8]. However, since the OpenCompass score is derived from 8 academic VQA benchmarks and covers only subset of overall capabilities, we still need further effort to match the performance with closed-source models. and Claude-3.5-Sonnet [8], have demonstrated exceptional performance, their closed nature limits transparency and accessibility, leaving gaps in the open-source community. While open-source multimodal models such as the InternVL series [36, 35, 71] and Qwen-VL series [13, 246] have provided high-performance, transparent alternatives, they still fall short in terms of achieving the desired levels of performance and efficiency. In this work, we introduce InternVL 2.5, an advanced large-scale MLLM series that builds upon the foundational architecture of InternVL 2.0. Continuing the objectives of the entire InternVL series, we aim to bridge the performance gap between commercial closed-source models and open-source multimodal models. In InternVL 2.5, we systematically explore various factors in MLLM, including how changes in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and inference times affect the overall performance of the model, demonstrating the relationship between scaling and performance in multimodal models. Specifically, we have some interesting findings: (1) Large vision encoders significantly reduce the dependency on training data when scaling up MLLMs. As shown in Table 3, compared to Qwen2-VL-72B [246] equipped with 600M vision encoder, our InternVL2.578B with 6B vision encoder can achieve better performance using only 1/10 of the training tokens. This greatly reduces the exploration cost when scaling up MLLMs; (2) Data quality matters. Upgrading InternVL from 2.0 to 2.5 doubled the dataset size, but strict filtering greatly improved quality. For example, we carefully excluded the anomalous samples (e.g., repetitive patterns), achieving substantial improvements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks such as MMMU [289] and complex challenges like the OlympiadBench [80]. Note that, most existing open-source MLLMs tend to underperform when using CoT [249]. (3) Test-time scaling is beneficial for difficult multimodal QA. For challenging tasks such as MMMU, the InternVL2.5-78B with CoT reaches 70.1%, which is 3.7 points higher than the direct response. Subsequently, we have successfully verified that CoT can be further combined with majority voting and bring additional improvements. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We release InternVL 2.5 to the open-source community, providing powerful tool for the development and application of multimodal AI systems and encouraging further research in this domain. (2) We investigate how scaling different components of the MLLMs such as vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and inference time affect performance. (3) Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarksincluding multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processingInternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive 2 Figure 2: Overall architecture. InternVL 2.5 retains the same model architecture as InternVL 1.5 [35] and InternVL 2.0, i.e. the widely-used ViT-MLP-LLM paradigm, which combines pre-trained InternViT-300M or InternViT-6B with LLMs [19, 229] of various sizes via an MLP projector. Consistent with previous versions, we apply pixel unshuffle operation to reduce the 1024 visual tokens produced by each 448448 image tile to 256 tokens. Moreover, compared to InternVL 1.5, InternVL 2.0 and 2.5 introduced additional data types, incorporating multi-image and video data alongside the existing single-image and text-only data. performance, rivaling leading commercial models like GPT-4o [192] and Claude-3.5-Sonnet [8]. It is the first open-source MLLM to surpass 70% on the MMMU validation set [289], setting new benchmark and highlighting the potential of open-source solutions in advancing multimodal AI."

            "content": "As shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, InternVL 2.5 retains the same model architecture as its predecessors, InternVL 1.5 [35] and InternVL 2.0, following the ViT-MLP-LLM paradigm widely adopted in various MLLM studies [150, 151, 36, 316, 162, 246, 124, 256]. In this new version, our implementation of this architecture integrates newly incrementally pre-trained InternViT-6B or InternViT-300M with various pre-trained LLMs of different sizes and types, including InternLM 2.5 [19] and Qwen 2.5 [229], using randomly initialized 2-layer MLP projector. As in the previous version, to enhance scalability for high-resolution processing, we simply applied pixel unshuffle operation, reducing the number of visual tokens to one-quarter of the original. Consequently, in our model, 448448 image tile is represented by 256 visual tokens. In terms of input data preprocessing, we adopted similar dynamic resolution strategy as InternVL 1.5, dividing images into tiles of 448448 pixels based on the aspect ratio and resolution of the input images. The key difference, starting from InternVL 2.0, is that we additionally introduced support for multi-image and video data, as shown in Figure 2(b). Different data types correspond to different preprocessing configurations, which we will detail in Section 3.1."

InternViT-6B-224px was first introduced in our CVPR paper [36], and its structure follows the vanilla ViT [61], with minor adjustments incorporating QK-Norm [53] and RMSNorm [294]. It had 5.9B parameters, 48 layers, hidden size of 3200, and 25 heads, and it was trained using contrastive loss [195]. Due to the limited gains at that time, we adopted an incremental pre-training strategy to continuously refine its weights.

In the InternVL 2.5 series, we upgraded both the vision encoder and the language model, resulting in improved performance. The OpenCompass scores for InternVL 1.5 and InternVL 2.0 were collected from the OpenCompass leaderboard, while the scores for InternVL 2.5 series were obtained through our local testing. for training, but in later versions, we switched to dynamic resolution training to improve high-resolution processing. As detailed in the InternVL 1.5 report [35], we removed the last three layers of InternViT-6B448px-V1.2, reducing its depth from 48 to 45 layers, as these layers were more tuned to the CLIP loss objective, prioritizing global alignment over local information. As result, all subsequent versions, including the latest InternViT-6B-448px-V2.5, have 45 layers and 5.5B parameters. InternViT-300M. InternViT-300M-448px-Distill is distilled variant of the teacher model, InternViT-6B-448pxV1.5, utilizing cosine distillation loss. This model comprises 0.3B parameters, 24 layers, hidden size of 1024, and 16 attention heads. Unlike the 6B version, the 0.3B variant employs standard LayerNorm [11] without QK-Norm [53]. To reduce distillation costs, we initialized this model using CLIP-ViT-Large-336px [195] where applicable, despite some architectural differences. After distillation, we integrated this model with an LLM and, following similar procedure as described above, trained the vision encoder with dynamic high-resolution and the NTP loss. Then, we extracted the vision encoder and released it as InternViT-300M-448px. In this report, we further refined the InternViT-300M by incrementally pre-training the previous weights on more diverse data mixture using the NTP loss, leading to the enhanced InternViT-300M-448px-V2.5."

            "title": "3.1 Dynamic High-Resolution for Multimodal Data",
            "content": "In InternVL 2.0 and 2.5, we extend the dynamic high-resolution training approach introduced in InternVL 1.5 [35], enhancing its capabilities to handle multi-image and video datasets. The process mainly consists of the following steps: Closest Aspect Ratio Matching. Given an input image with dimensions H, the aspect ratio is computed as = . The objective is to resize the image into tiles of size (where = 448) while selecting the closest aspect ratio that minimizes distortion. The number of tiles, ntiles, is constrained within predefined range [nmin, nmax]. To find the optimal aspect ratio for resizing, we define the set of target aspect ratios as: = {i/j 1 i, n, [nmin, nmax]} . (1) The closest aspect ratio rbest is selected by minimizing the difference between the original aspect ratio and each target aspect ratio rtarget: rbest = arg min rtargetR rtarget . (2) In cases where multiple aspect ratios produce the same difference (e.g., 1:2 and 2:4), we prioritize the aspect ratio that results in an area less than or equal to twice the original image size. This helps to some extent in preventing the excessive enlargement of low-resolution images. Image Resizing and Splitting. Once the best aspect ratio is determined, the image is resized to new dimensions Wnew Hnew, where ibest and jbest are the factors corresponding to rbest: Wnew = ibest, Hnew = jbest. (3) The image is then split into tiles of size S, with the number of tiles calculated as ntiles = ibest jbest. Each tile is cropped from the resized image to ensure consistent size. Thumbnail Generation. Optionally, if the number of tiles ntiles > 1, the original image is resized to square of dimensions to generate an additional thumbnail Ithumb. This thumbnail is appended to the list of tiles, providing global view alongside the localized tiles. In cases where ntiles = 1, there is no thumbnail to append, and the mechanism naturally skips this step. Data Formats for Different Data Types. As shown in Figure 3, the dynamic high-resolution method in InternVL 2.0 and 2.5 extends beyond single-image datasets to also support multi-image and video datasets. Figure 4: Illustration of the training pipeline and progressive scaling strategy. (a) Single model training pipeline: The training process is divided into three stagesStage 1 (MLP warmup), optional Stage 1.5 (ViT incremental learning), and Stage 2 (full model instruction tuning). The multi-stage design progressively enhances vision-language alignment, stabilizes training, and prepares modules for integration with larger LLMs. (b) Progressive scaling strategy: The ViT module trained with smaller LLM in earlier stages can be easily integrated with larger LLMs, enabling scalable model alignment with affordable resource overhead. For single-image datasets, the maximum number of tiles nmax is allocated to single image, ensuring that it is processed at the highest possible resolution. In this scenario, visual tokens are enclosed within <img> and </img> tags, with no additional auxiliary tags used. In the case of multi-image datasets, the total number of tiles nmax is distributed across all images within one sample. Each image is identified by an auxiliary tag like Image-1 to clearly label individual images. The images themselves are enclosed within <img> and </img> tags, denoting the start and end of the image data. The number of tiles assigned to each image Ii is proportional to the total number of images Nimage, following the equation: (cid:18) nmax, = max 1, (cid:22) nmax Nimage (cid:23)(cid:19) . (4) For video data, this approach is simplified by setting nmax = 1. Each video frame is resized to fixed resolution of 448448, eliminating the need for tiling. This is because, during training, large number of frames (e.g., 32 or 64) are typically extracted from single video. For our model, even without high-resolution input, this still results in 8,192 or 16,384 visual tokens. Each video frame, labeled with tags like Frame-1, is enclosed within the <img> and </img> tags, similar to image data."

Notably, Qwen2-VL [246] processed cumulative total of 1.4T tokens, while our InternVL2.5-78B is trained on just 120B tokens. Stage 1: MLP Warmup. As shown in Figure 4(a), the training begins with warming up the MLP projector, which is the initial bridge between visual and language representations. In this stage, only the MLP projector is trained while both the vision encoder (i.e., InternViT [36]) and language model are frozen. To achieve optimal performance, we begin using the dynamic high-resolution training strategy from this stage, even though it increases the training cost. In this phase, we utilize the pre-training data mixture as outlined in Table 4. The data is formatted in structured ChatML style and optimized with the NTP loss. Additionally, higher learning rate is applied to accelerate convergence, allowing the MLP to quickly adapt to the LLMs input space and establish robust cross-modal alignment. The MLP warmup phase ensures the model is well-prepared to handle multimodal tasks before unlocking additional trainable components in later stages, thereby improving training stability. Stage 1.5: ViT Incremental Learning (Optional). As shown in Figure 4(a), Stage 1.5 introduces incremental learning for the vision encoder. During this stage, both the vision encoder and MLP projector are trainable, and training is conducted using the same pre-training data mixture and NTP loss as in Stage 1. The aim of this stage is to enhance the vision encoders ability to extract visual features, allowing it to capture more comprehensive information, especially for domains that are relatively rare in web-scale datasets (e.g., LAION-5B [203]), such as multilingual OCR data and mathematical charts, among others. As shown in Table 3, lower learning rate is used in this stage to prevent catastrophic forgetting, ensuring the encoder doesnt lose previously learned capabilities. Additionally, the vision encoder only needs to be trained once unless new domain requirements or data are introduced. Once trained, it can be reused with different LLMs without retraining (see Figure 4(b) and Section 3.3), making Stage 1.5 optional. This is particularly beneficial when the encoder has already been optimized for some specific tasks, allowing it to integrate with LLMs of various sizes without significant additional costs. Stage 2: Full Model Instruction Tuning. In the final stage, as illustrated in Figure 4(a), the entire modelcomprising the ViT, MLP, and LLMis trained on high-quality multimodal instruction datasets. Data quality is especially important here, as the LLM, responsible for generating the final user-facing output, is now trainable. Even small amount of noisy data (e.g., few thousand samples) can lead to abnormal model behavior, like repetitive output or specific erroneous results. To mitigate the degradation of the LLM, we implement strict data quality controls during this stage. Additionally, the training hyperparameters in this stage are kept simple, with unified learning rate applied to the entire model rather than different learning rates for various components. After completing this stage, InternVL 2.5s full training process is finished. Although further improvements could be made through Stage 3post-training with higher-quality data or other training methods (e.g., preference optimization)we plan to leave this for the future."

            "title": "3.3 Progressive Scaling Strategy",
            "content": "As shown in Figure 4, we propose progressive scaling strategy to efficiently align the vision encoder (e.g., InternViT) with LLMs. While we previously adopted similar strategy in the training of InternVL 1.5 and 2.0, this is the first time the approach has been formalized into clear methodology. This strategy adopts staged training approach, starting with smaller, resource-efficient LLMs and progressively scaling up to larger LLMs. This approach stems from our observation that even when the ViT and LLM are jointly trained using NTP loss, the resulting visual features are generalizable representations that can be easily understood by other LLMs. Specifically, in Stage 1.5, the InternViT is trained alongside smaller LLM (e.g., 20B), focusing on optimizing fundamental visual capabilities and cross-modal alignment. This phase avoids the high computational costs associated with training directly with large LLM. Using shared-weight mechanism, the trained InternViT can be easily transferred to larger LLM (e.g., 72B) without requiring retraining. Consequently, when training larger model, Stage 1.5 can be skipped, as the optimized InternViT module from earlier stages is reused. This not only accelerates training but also ensures that the vision encoders learned representations are preserved and effectively integrated into the larger model. By employing this progressive scaling strategy, we achieve scalable model updates at fraction of the cost typically associated with large-scale MLLM training. For example, Qwen2-VL [246] processes cumulative total of 1.4 trillion tokens, whereas our InternVL2.5-78B is trained on only about 120 billion tokensless than one-tenth of Qwen2-VL. This approach proves particularly advantageous in resource-constrained settings by maximizing the reuse of pre-trained components, minimizing redundant computations, and enabling the efficient training of models capable of addressing complex vision-language tasks."

These optimizations are essential in improving the user experience and the models benchmark performance. Random JPEG Compression. To avoid overfitting during training and enhance the models real-world performance, we apply data augmentation technique that preserves spatial information: JPEG compression. Specifically, random JPEG compression with quality levels between 75 and 100 is applied to simulate the degradation commonly found in internet-sourced images. This augmentation improves the models robustness to noisy, compressed images and enhances the user experience by ensuring more consistent performance across varied image qualities. Loss Reweighting. Token averaging and sample averaging are two widely applied strategies for weighting the NTP loss. Token averaging computes the average NTP loss across all tokens, whereas sample averaging first averages the NTP loss within each sample (across tokens) and then averages across the number of samples. These strategies can be expressed in unified format: = wi wj (cid:80) Li, wi = (cid:26) 1 x0 , 1 x1 , for token averaging for sample averaging, (5) where Li and wi denote the loss and weight of token i, respectively, and denotes the number of tokens in the response to which token belongs. When using token averaging, each token contributes equally to the final loss, which can result in gradients biased toward responses with more tokens, leading to drop in benchmark performance. In contrast, sample averaging ensures that each sample contributes equally, but it can cause the model to favor shorter responses, negatively impacting the user experience. To mitigate bias toward either longer or shorter responses during 8 Figure 5: Dataset configuration. In InternVL 2.0 and 2.5, data augmentation is applied selectively, enabled for image datasets and disabled for videos and text.

            "content": "In InternVL 2.0 and 2.5, the organization of the training data is controlled by several key parameters to optimize the balance and distribution of datasets during training, as shown in Figure 5. Data Augmentation. Firstly, data augmentation (i.e., JPEG compression introduced in Section 3.4) is applied conditionally, allowing for enhanced robustness by enabling or disabling augmentation techniques based on dataset characteristics. Specifically, we enable this augmentation for all image datasets, while disabling it for all video datasets, to ensure that different video frames have the same image quality. Maximum Tile Number. The parameter nmax defines the maximum number of tiles allowed per dataset, effectively controlling the resolution of the image or video frame fed into the model. This ensures flexibility in handling datasets of varying complexity and type. For example, we can set nmax = 24 or 36 for multi-image datasets, high-resolution documents, or infographics, use nmax = 6 or 12 for most other low-resolution image datasets, and set nmax = 1 for video datasets. This adjustment was first introduced in InternVL 2.0, whereas in InternVL 1.5, uniform value of nmax = 12 was applied across all datasets. Repeat Factor. Finally, the repeat factor determines the sampling frequency of each dataset. With (0, 4], this parameter enables down-sampling when < 1, reducing the datasets weight during training, or up-sampling when > 1, effectively increasing the number of epochs for that dataset. This mechanism finely adjusts the relative proportions of datasets, ensuring balanced distribution across training data. By adjusting r, especially in multi-task learning, the data from each domain or task receives appropriate training, preventing overfitting or underfitting of any single dataset, leading to more balanced model performance."

            "content": "In InternVL 2.0 and 2.5, we implement data-packing strategy to enhance GPU utilization and improve training efficiency. This approach reduces padding by concatenating multiple samples into longer sequences, thereby maximizing the utilization of the models input sequence capacity. Specifically, for multimodal models like InternVL, data packing should account for two dimensions: (a) Sequence length for the LLM, which corresponds to the standard input sequence length used in language models. This remains essential in multimodal tasks; (b) Image tile number for the ViT, which denotes the number of image tiles processed by the vision encoder. Efficient management of this dimension is crucial for optimizing training efficiency. To handle these dimensions efficiently, our data-packing strategy comprises the following steps: (1) Select: During the selection phase, the algorithm operates similarly to standard dataset without datapacking, directly sampling independent data. Each sampled item is truncated into multiple smaller items and treated as separate samples. This ensures that the sequence length and image tile count of each sample are within the predefined thresholds lmax (context length) and tmax (image tile limit), respectively. (2) Search: For given independent sample, the algorithm searches for another sample from the buffer list to pack them together. The resulting packed sample must have sequence length shorter than lmax and include fewer than tmax image tiles. If multiple buffers satisfy these requirements, the one with the longest sequence 9 Figure 6: Visualization of abnormal samples in open-source datasets. Abnormal samples are prevalent across various data types, including single-image, multi-image, video, and pure text datasets, with repetitive outputs being prominent issue. We identify this as one of the most detrimental problems for test-time scaling, often leading models into loops in long-form outputs and CoT reasoning tasks. length and the maximum number of image tiles is selected. In practice, the buffer list is maintained in descending order and binary search is performed to accelerate the search process. (3) Pack: The sampled data and the selected buffer are packed into single sequence. If no buffer is selected in the previous step, the sample remains unchanged and proceeds directly to the next phase. Notably, tokens in the packed data can only attend to the context within their respective samples and cannot attend to tokens from other packed samples. Furthermore, the positional index of each sample is maintained independently. (4) Maintain: In the maintenance phase, if packed sample exceeds lmax or contains more than tmax image tiles, it is immediately yielded for training. Otherwise, the packed sample is inserted into the buffer list. If the buffer list exceeds its capacity, the sample with the longest sequence length and the highest number of image tiles is yielded to maintain buffer efficiency."

            "title": "4.3 Data Filtering Pipeline",
            "content": "During model development, we observed that LLMs are significantly more sensitive to data noise than vision encoders. As shown in Figure 4, during Stage 2, when all model weights are fully trainable, even small fraction of anomalous samplessuch as outliers or repetitive data, numbering only few thousandcan lead to aberrant model behavior during inference. While conventional wisdom assumes that minor noise in large-scale datasets can be ignored, our findings indicate otherwise: even tiny fraction of noisy samples can degrade MLLM performance and user experience. Among these anomalies, we identify repetitive generation as one of the most detrimental issues. In many open-source or synthetic datasets, small number of repetitive samplescomprising merely thousands of examples in our Stage 2 data mixturecan cause the model to spiral into repetitive loops, particularly in long-form outputs or CoT reasoning tasks. This phenomenon undermines the effectiveness of test-time scaling strategies. To address this challenge and support future research, we designed an efficient data filtering pipeline to remove low-quality samples, thereby minimizing the risk of repetitive generation. As shown in Figure 8, our data filtering pipeline consists of two modules. For pure-text data, we implemented three key strategies: (1) LLM-Based Quality Scoring: We begin by categorizing datasets into distinct domains 10 Figure 7: Statistics of the fine-tuning data mixture. The dataset shows consistent growth from InternVL 1.5 to 2.5 in terms of (a) the number of samples and (b) the number of tokens across multiple dataset types, including single-image, multi-image, video, and text. These statistics reflect iterative improvements in data scale and diversity, which enhance the models multimodal understanding capabilities. Figure 8: Dataset filtering pipeline. For text data, we use three methods: (a) LLM-based quality scoring to assign domain-specific quality scores and filter low-quality samples; (b) Repetition detection to identify and remove data with repetitive patterns; and (c) heuristic rule-based filtering to detect anomalies using predefined rules. For multimodal data, only (b) repetition detection and (c) heuristic rule-based filtering are applied to mitigate repetitive patterns and ensure dataset integrity. (e.g., disciplinary, programming, mathematics, general). Next, we assign quality score, ranging from 0 to 10, to each sample using pre-trained LLM [229] with domain-specific prompt. Samples with scores below specified threshold (e.g., 7) are then removed to ensure data quality. (2) Repetition Detection: We use an LLM combined with specialized prompt to identify repetitive samples. These samples are then subjected to manual review, and those scoring below threshold (e.g., 3) are removed to maintain data quality. (3) Heuristic Rule-Based Filtering: We apply specific rules, such as filtering out sentences with abnormal lengths, excessively long sequences of zeros, text with an excessive number of duplicate lines, etc, to identify anomalies in the data. Although this approach may occasionally produce false positives, it improves the detection of anomalous samples. All flagged samples are manually reviewed before final removal. For multimodal data, given the limitations of open-source MLLMs in scoring such data, we focused on mitigating repetitive patterns through two strategies: (1) Repetition Detection: We exempted high-quality academic datasets and used specific prompt to identify repetitive samples in the remaining data. These samples were removed following the same manual review process we applied to textual data. (2) Heuristic Rule-Based Filtering: Similar heuristic rules are applied, followed by manual verification to ensure dataset integrity. This rigorous data-filtering pipeline significantly reduced the occurrence of anomalous behaviors, particularly repetitive generation, with notable improvements in CoT reasoning tasks. However, we recognize that data filtering alone cannot completely eliminate such issues. This may be due to the inherent noise introduced during the LLMs pre-training process, which our multimodal post-training efforts can only partially mitigate without fundamentally resolving the issue of repetitive outputs. Future work will explore preference optimization and other strategies to further suppress anomalies and enhance both model performance and user experience. 11 Task Type: Single/Multi-Image Datasets Dataset Captioning General QA Mathematics Chart OCR Knowledge Grounding Document Conversation Medical FaceCaption [49], COCO-Caption [214], OpenImages-Caption [116], Objects365-Caption [208], TextCap [211], Laion-ZH [203], Laion-EN [203], Laion-COCO [204], LLaVAR [305], InternVL-SA-1B-Caption [113], MMInstruct [155], GRIT-Caption [194], ShareGPT4V [29], LVIS-Instruct-4V [244], ShareCaptioner [29], OmniCorpus [133], ShareGPT4o [35] GQA [98], OKVQA [178], A-OKVQA [205], Visual7W [317], VisText [226], VSR [147], TallyQA [2], Objects365-YorN [208], IconQA [167], Stanford40 [273], VisDial [51], VQAv2 [74], Hateful-Memes [111] MAVIS [300], GeomVerse [107], MetaMath-Rendered [281], MapQA [23], GeoQA+ [20], Geometry3K [164], UniGeo [26], GEOS [206], CLEVR-Math [144] ChartQA [181], PlotQA [187], FigureQA [105], LRV-Instruction [148], ArxivQA [132], MMC-Inst [149], TabMWP [166], DVQA [104], UniChart [182], SimChart9K [263], Chart2Text [191], FinTabNet [312], SciTSR [39], Synthetic Chart2Markdown LaionCOCO-OCR [204], Wukong-OCR [75], ParsynthOCR [89], SynthDoG-EN [112], SynthDoG-ZH [112], SynthDoG-RU [112], SynthDoG-JP [112], SynthDoG-KO [112], IAM [180], EST-VQA [253], ST-VQA [17], NAF [52], InfoVQA [183], HME100K [288], OCRVQA [188], SROIE [97], POIE [115], CTW [287], SynthText [79], ArT [40], LSVT [222], RCTW-17 [209], ReCTs [301], MTWI [82], TextVQA [212], CASIA [146], TextOCR [213], Chinese-OCR [14], EATEN [78], COCO-Text [238], Synthetic Arxiv OCR, Synthetic Image2Latex, Synthetic Handwritten OCR, Synthetic Infographic2Markdown KVQA [207], A-OKVQA [205], ViQuAE [123], iNaturalist2018 [237], MovieNet [95], ART500K [176], KonIQ-10K [91], IconQA [167], VisualMRC [225], ChemVLM Data [129], ScienceQA [165], AI2D [109], TQA [110], Wikipedia-QA [81], Synthetic Multidisciplinary Knowledge / QA Objects365 [208], GRIT [278], RefCOCO [280], GPT4Gen-RD-BoxCoT [27], All-Seeing-V1 [251], All-Seeing-V2 [250], V3Det [243], TolokaVQA [236] DocReason25K [93], DocVQA [184], Docmatix [121], Synthetic Arxiv QA ALLaVA [25], SVIT [309], Cambrain-GPT4o [234], TextOCR-GPT4V [102], MMDU [159], Synthetic Real-World Conversations PMC-VQA [303], VQA-RAD [120], ImageCLEF [72], SLAKE [145], Medical-Diff-VQA [94], PMC-CaseReport [260], GMAI-VL [134] Screen2Words [240], WebSight [122] Mementos [254], ShareGPT4Video [30], VideoGPT+ [174], ShareGPT4o-Video [35] VideoChat2-IT [131], EgoTaskQA [99], NTU RGB+D [152], CLEVRER [276], STAR [259], LSMDC [201] GUI Type: Video Datasets Captioning General QA Table 4: Summary of the pre-training data mixture of InternVL 2.5.

            "content": "Multidisciplinary reasoning ability reflects models capacity to comprehend, process, and manipulate abstract concepts, which is crucial for complex problem-solving and decision-making tasks. In the left section of Table 6, we provide comparison of InternVL 2.5s performance on multidisciplinary reasoning-related benchmarks, including MMMU [289] and MMMU-Pro [290]. Here, we test both direct-answer and CoT reasoning performance, reporting the higher score. The results suggest that our model achieves encouraging improvements over existing open-source models, such as LLaVAOneVision [124], NVLM [50], VILA 1.5 [143], and Qwen2-VL [246], as well as notable progress compared to earlier versions of the InternVL2 series. Specifically, InternVL2.5-78B achieves score exceeding 70 on the MMMU validation set, representing 7.4-point improvement over InternVL2-Llama3-76B. These results indicate that our models performance is moving closer to that of some advanced closed-source models, such as GPT-4o [192], Claude-3.5-Sonnet [8], and Gemini-1.5-Pro [200]. Additionally, through majority voting, the score of InternVL2-Llama3-76B on the MMMU benchmark is improved from 62.7 to 65.3 when using CoT. We observe similar phenomenon in InternVL 2.5 as well, which demonstrates that test-time scaling can improve the CoT reasoning of MLLMs. Mathematical reasoning reflects higher-level reasoning capability and enhances the potential of MLLMs in scientific and engineering applications. In the right-hand section of Table 6, we present InternVL 2.5s performance across four multimodal mathematical benchmarks. These results demonstrate significant progress over InternVL 2.0. Notably, InternVL2.5-78B achieved an accuracy of 72.3% on the MathVista test-mini set [163]. Additionally, on the challenging OlympiadBench [80], the InternVL 2.5 series showed an overall improvement compared to the 2.0 series.

            "content": "Table 7 provides detailed comparison of InternVL 2.5 with its predecessor InternVL 2.0, other representative open-source models (e.g., Qwen2-VL [246], LLaVA-OneVision [124]), and closed-source models (e.g., GPT4o [192], Claude-3.5-Sonnet [8]) on OCR-related tasks. Across most benchmarks, InternVL 2.5 achieves significant improvements over InternVL 2.0 at all model scales and demonstrates performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art model, Qwen2-VL-72B [246], reflecting the effectiveness of the improvements in training strategies and data quality. However, at the 2B scale, InternVL2.5-2B underperforms compared to Qwen2-VL-2B on benchmarks such as TextVQA [212], DocVQA [184], and InfoVQA [183]. We suspect that, in addition to differences in data and training strategies, model architecture may also play significant role. Specifically, Qwen2-VL-2B features 600M vision encoder and 1.5B language model, whereas InternVL2.5-2B employs smaller 300M vision encoder paired with 1.8B language model. It appears that, for smaller-scale MLLM (e.g., 2B), the size of the vision encoder plays relatively important role in OCR performance, given the same total parameter budget. Additionally, InternVL 2.5 demonstrates exceptional performance on the visual caption restoration (VCR) task [302]. The 2.5 series achieves significant improvement over InternVL 2.0 on this task, with the 2B model reaching EM/Jaccard scores of 93.2/97.6, far surpassing the previous generations 32.9/59.2. This improvement can be attributed to the introduction of small portion of the VCR training set (approximately 22K samples). We find that the models poor performance on VCR tasks was not due to inadequate OCR capabilities but rather to its insufficient instruction-following ability for task-specific directives. By leveraging these few but focused samples, InternVL 2.5 exhibits remarkable enhancement in its instruction-following ability for the VCR task, resulting in substantial performance boost."

In the left part of Table 8, we evaluate the multi-image understanding capabilities of InternVL 2.5 across six diverse benchmarks: BLINK [70], Mantis-Eval [100], MMIU [186], MuirBench [241], MMTBench [277], and MIRB [308]. These benchmarks test range of skills, including reasoning across images, integrating information, and addressing task-specific requirements. InternVL 2.5 achieves consistent improvements over InternVL 2.0 across all model scales, reflecting enhanced reasoning ability and better integration of multi-image information. For instance, at the 2B scale, InternVL2.5-2B delivers significant gains on Mantis-Eval (54.8 vs. 48.4) and MuirBench (40.6 vs. 32.5). These advancements can be largely attributed to the inclusion of additional multi-image datasets, as detailed in Section 4.5. These 18 datasets, which were carefully curated and of high quality, played critical role in improving the models ability to understand and reason across multiple visual inputs. At larger scales, InternVL 2.5 demonstrates substantial progress and achieves competitive performance with advanced closed-source models. For example, InternVL2.5-78B scores 55.8 on MMIU, closely matching GPT-4os 55.7, and achieves score of 70.8 on MMT-Bench, surpassing GPT-4os 65.4. These results highlight the importance of scaling model size and incorporating high-quality training data specifically tailored for multi-image tasks. However, on BLINK and MuirBench, our model still exhibits performance gap of around 5 points compared to GPT-4o [192], suggesting that further improvements are needed, potentially through the inclusion of additional high-quality multi-image training data."

In benchmarks like RealWorldQA, MME-RealWorld, and R-Bench, which involve multiple-choice questions, InternVL 2.5 demonstrates strong real-world perceptual and understanding abilities. Differently, the WildVision benchmark uses GPT-4o [192] as the judge model to evaluate the performance of various MLLM against the reference model, Claude-3-Sonnet [8]. In this benchmark, the models output quality and user experience are key metrics. Although InternVL2.5-78B performs well in providing concise answers, it still shows gap when generating longer responses to match human preferences. Specifically, InternVL2.5-78B scores 71.4, while GPT-4o scores 80.6, indicating notable difference in user experience. These results indicate that, while InternVL 2.5 delivers accurate and concise responses across most tasks, there is potential for improvement in generating more personalized and detailed answers.

To evaluate this comprehensively, we tested six benchmarks: Video-MME [69], MVBench [131], MMBench-Video [65], MLVU [315], LongVideoBench [262], and CG-Bench [7], covering diverse tasks from short video comprehension to long video reasoning. As shown in Table 12, InternVL 2.5 achieves consistent improvements over InternVL 2.0 across all benchmarks. For example, our smallest model, InternVL2.5-1B improves Video-MME scores from 42.9/45.4 to 50.3/52.3 and MVBench from 57.5 to 64.3. Moreover, we find that InternVL 2.5 demonstrates better scalability when handling increasing input frames compared to its predecessor, as shown in Figure 10. We attribute these improvements to two key enhancements: (1) The inclusion of more highquality video data, which has significantly enhanced the models video understanding capabilities. (2) Adjusting the training frame sampling strategy from 424 to 832 frames (as shown in Figure 5(c)) enhanced the models ability to process richer video information.

            "content": "In the development of MLLMs, maintaining strong pure language capabilities remains critically important. Following the approach of InternLM2 [19], we conducted comprehensive evaluation of our models performance across 17 pure language benchmarks using the OpenCompass toolkit [46]. These benchmarks are categorized into five major groups, providing thorough assessment of the models pure language abilities. The results show that InternVL 2.0 demonstrates slight decline in pure language performance compared to its foundational LLM counterparts. For example, InternVL2-2B achieved an average score of 39.2, decrease of 2.1 points compared to InternLM2-1.8B-Chat. Similarly, InternVL2-8B scored an average of 67.2, 2.3 points lower than InternLM2.5-7B-Chat. To address this issue, we curated large collection of high-quality open-source pure language instruction data and applied rigorous filtering pipelines to eliminate low-quality samples, thereby enhancing the overall data quality. These improvements in InternVL 2.5 have effectively mitigated the decline in language performance, enabling the model to match or even surpass the original LLM in several tasks. This demonstrates that supplementing and optimizing with high-quality language data can not only preserve MLLMs pure language capabilities but also establish stronger foundation for multimodal tasks."

It evaluates the quality of the learned features without updating the backbone, providing insights into how effectively the pre-trained model captures semantic information usable by simple linear classifier in downstream tasks like image classification. Attention Pooling Probing: In contrast, attention pooling probing evaluates the model by adding an attention pooling layer on top of the frozen features. This approach allows the vision encoder to retain richer information in the final layer, as attention pooling can dynamically select task-relevant features for classification without interference from unrelated information. For both experiments, we use ImageNet-1K [56] as the training set and evaluate the models on the ImageNet-1K validation set along with several ImageNet variants (i.e., ImageNet-ReaL [16], ImageNet-V2 [199], ImageNetA [87], ImageNet-R [84], and ImageNet-Sketch [242]) to benchmark their domain generalization capabilities. The models are trained using SGD as the optimizer, with peak learning rate of 0.2, momentum of 0.9, and no weight decay. cosine learning rate decay schedule is applied over 10 training epochs, with 1 warmup epoch. We use input resolutions of 448448, with patch size of 14 and total batch size of 1024. Data augmentation techniques, such as random resized cropping and horizontal flipping, are employed during training.

            "content": "As shown in Table 14, the results reveal an interesting trend across the version updates of InternViT: as the model progresses, the performance of linear probing declines substantially, with all versions showing an average below the gray baseline. In contrast, attention pooling probing consistently outperforms the gray baseline despite some fluctuations. This results in growing trend in the average score difference (from 3.5 to 6.7), denoted as , across successive InternViT versions. This suggests that features in the models final layer become less linearly separable, likely as representations evolve to capture more complex, open-ended semantic information. The attention pooling mechanism effectively selects relevant features from this enriched representation space, offsetting challenges from reduced linear separability. Additionally, these findings imply that InternViT maintains key pre-training attributes through iterative updates without catastrophic forgetting. With each version, its representations grow more diverse, capturing open-set semantics and enhancing generalizationan advantage particularly valuable for MLLMs requiring high abstraction for real-world tasks. 1https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL/tree/main/classification 27 Linear Probing Attention Pooling Probing Model Name res. 224 88.2 InternViT-6B-224px InternViT-6B-224px 448 87.8 InternViT-6B-448px-V1.0 448 87.0 InternViT-6B-448px-V1.2 448 87.0 InternViT-6B-448px-V1.5 448 86.5 InternViT-6B-448px-V2.5 448 86.6 IN-1K IN-ReaL IN-V2 IN-A IN-R IN-Ske avg.

This method provides baseline for evaluating pixel-level semantic information with minimal adaptation, though it may not fully capture the encoders capacity for complex features. Head Tuning: In head tuning, the InternViT is frozen while the UperNet [264] head remains trainable, allowing the model to utilize stronger head to reduce its dependence on linear separability. This setup mitigates the decline in linear separability caused by the complex, open-ended features, enabling more precise evaluation of the vision encoders capabilities. Full Tuning: Full tuning involves making both the InternViT backbone and the UperNet [264] segmentation head trainable, allowing the model to adapt all layers for the target task and minimizing reliance on pre-existing linear separability. This setup provides an alternative perspective for evaluating the vision encoders capacity to extract visual features. We use AdamW [161] with peak learning rate of 4e-5 and polynomial decay schedule. Layer-wise learning rate decay (0.95) is applied in full tuning. Weight decay is set to 0.05 for both head and full tuning, and none for linear probing. The input resolution is 504504, with patch size of 14 and batch size of 16.

The results reveal distinct trends in how the models feature representations evolve across version updates. Linear probing results show decline in mIoU scores as the model versions progress, with average scores dropping from 45.0 in InternViT-6B-224px to 37.5 in InternViT-6B-448px-V2.5. This indicates that as InternViT updates, the features become less linearly separable, reflecting shift toward capturing more complex and open-ended information. In head tuning, the models display different trend compared to linear probing. All other versions of InternViT surpass the baseline InternViT-6B-224pxs mIoU score of 51.9, showing no performance decline. This leads to increasing 1 values, growing from 6.9 in InternViT-6B-224px to 15.1 in InternViT-6B-448px-V2.5. The rise in 1 suggests that while the features become less linearly separable, their quality remains intact, effectively capturing complex information. Similarly, full tuning yields consistent results, as seen in the 2 values. The increase in 2 from 10.2 in InternViT-6B-224px to 17.7 in InternViT-6B-448px-V2.5 further supports this trend. Overall, the increasing values of 1 and 2 across model versions highlight the shift from simple, linearly separable features to more complex, nonlinear representations. This evolution aligns with InternViTs growing capability to extract visual information as its versions progress within the development of InternVL. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our ViT incremental learning strategy in enhancing the vision encoders ability to extract open-ended features."

We systematically explore the relationship between model scaling and performance, analyzing vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that InternVL 2.5 achieves competitive performance across tasks such as multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, video understanding, multilingual processing, etc. Notably, it is the first open-source MLLM to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, narrowing the gap between open-source and commercial models like OpenAI o1.
