Introduction Humans explore and interact with the 3D physical world by perceiving their surroundings, taking actions, and engaging with others. Through these interactions, they form mental models that simulate the complexities of their environment. With just glimpse, humans can construct an internal 3D representation of their surroundings in their minds, enabling reasoning, navigation, and problem-solving. This remarkable ability has long been central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we introduce GenEx, platform designed to push this boundary by Generating an Explorable world and facilitating explorations in this generated world. GenEx combines two interconnected components: an imaginative world, which dynamically generates 3D environments for exploration, and an embodied agent, which interacts with this environment to refine its understanding and decision-making. Together, these components form symbiotic system that enables AI to simulate, explore, and learn in ways similar to human cognitive processes. We begin by constructing an imaginative world that captures 360, 3D environment grounded in the physical world, leveraging recent advancements in Generative AI. Starting from single image, the model generates new environments expansively and dynamically while maintaining coherence and 3D consistency, even during longdistance exploration. This boundless landscape provides endless opportunities for AI agents to explore and interact. The environment is brought into life in the form of diffusion video generation, conditioned on moving angle, distance, and single initial view to serve as starting point. To address fieldof-view constraints, we utilize panoramic representations and train our video diffusion models with spherical-consistent learning techniques. This ensures the generated environments maintain coherence and 3D consistency, even during long-distance exploration. To anchor our video generation model in the physical world, we curate training data from physics engines like Unreal En2024-12-13 gine, enabling realistic and immersive outputs. Within this imaginative landscape, embodied agents play crucial role. Enhanced by GPTs, these agents can explore unseen parts of the physical world with imagined observations to refine their understanding of surroundings, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. Furthermore, GenEx supports multi-agent scenarios, allowing agents to mentally navigate others positions, share imagined beliefs, and collaboratively refine their strategies. In summary, GenEx represents transformative step forward in the development of AI, offering platform that bridges the generative and physically grounded world. By enabling AI to explore, learn, and interact in boundless, dynamically generated environments, GenEx opens the door to applications ranging from real-world navigation, interactive gaming, and VR/AR to embodied AI. 2. Generating an Explorable World We define the explorable generative world and the problem in 2.1, present the world initialization in 2.2 and world transition in 2.3. 2.1. Problem Formulation Defining an explorable generative world. We define an explorable generative world as an AIgenerated virtual environment, constrained to the agents immediate surroundings. The generative world is both physically plausible and visually coherent. This environment is represented by the agents egocentric panoramic observations, denoted as x. While is synthesized, it remains grounded in intuitive physical principles and realistic appearance, akin to high-fidelity, physically realistic video game environment. Crucially, the explorable nature of our generative world ensures the agents experience is not limited to static scene. Instead, the environment dynamically evolves in response to the agents movements and actions, simulating continuous and coherent exploration. Formally, let 𝑎𝑡 be the agents action at step 𝑡, encompassGenEx: Generating an Explorable World 𝑡 , 𝑥1 𝑡 , . . . , 𝑥𝑆 ing both view rotation 𝛼 and forward distance 𝑑. Let x𝑡 = (𝑥0 𝑡 ) represent the sequence of panoramic observations encountered as the agent moves according to 𝑎𝑡, where 𝑆 corresponds to sequence length in x𝑡, or the traveled distance. Each 𝑥 𝑠 𝑡 in x𝑡 is generated to reflect the environments currently perceivable state, ensuring that the agents evolving viewpoint remains coherent and physically meaningful. We train our models using data harvested from controlled, simulated setting. By employing physics-based data engine (2.2), we ensure realistic and diverse training scenarios that capture the intricate variations encountered in complex, virtual landscapes. Task formulation: We reformulate the task of exploring generative world as the problem of generating an initial panoramic world view 𝑥0 and sequence of world views represented by panoramic videos x1:𝑇 , together represented as x0:𝑇 , given single initial image 𝑖0, description 𝑙0, and action 𝑎𝑡 at each step 𝑡, where 𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇. Formally, we have 𝑝(x0:𝑇 𝑖0, 𝑙0) = 𝑝𝜃1 (𝑥 𝑖0, 𝑙0) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:124) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) world initialization (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) 𝑇 (cid:214) 𝑝𝜃2 𝑡=1 (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:124) (cid:0)x𝑡 𝑥𝑆 𝑡1, 𝑎𝑡(cid:1) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) world transition (cid:125) Algorithm 1 Generating an Explorable World 𝑝(x0:𝑇 𝑖0, 𝑙0) Require: initial single-view image 𝑖0. language description 𝑙0 specifying the desired panoramic world initialization. conditional distribution 𝑝𝜃1 (𝑥 𝑖0, 𝑙0), parameterized by an image-to-panorama generation model 𝜃1 to initialize the 360 world.

In this unified form, the core terms are: 2.2. World Initialization World initialization (2.2): Given the initial image 𝑖0 and language description 𝑙0, the anchor 360 world view 𝑥0 is sampled from: 𝑥0 𝑝𝜃1 (𝑥 𝑖0, 𝑙0), where 𝜃1 is an image-to-panorama generator. World transition (2.3): Given the chosen action 𝑎𝑡, the next world view x𝑡 is sampled from: x𝑡 = (𝑥0 𝑡 , 𝑥1 𝑡 , . . . , 𝑥𝑆 𝑡 ) 𝑝𝜃2 (x 𝑥𝑆 𝑡1, 𝑎𝑡), where 𝜃2 is 360 panoramic video generator, 𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇, and 𝑥𝑆 0 𝑥0. Preliminary: data and representation. Collecting diverse world exploration data in the real world is challenging due to resource constraints and environmental variability. Thus, we utilize physics engines such as Unreal Engine 5 and Unity in Figure 2 for data curation. These engines allow for the creation of rich, diverse virtual environments where we can simulate exploration trajectories and collect corresponding data efficiently."

One common panoramic representation is the cubemap, which projects 360 view onto the six faces of cube. Each face 3 GenEx: Generating an Explorable World World initialization model. Starting from single input image 𝑖0, we aim to construct full 360 panoramic representation 𝑥0 of the agents environment. To achieve this, we condition pretrained text-to-image diffusion model on both the input image 𝑖0 and text description 𝑙0 of the desired 3D world, yielding high-dynamic-range panorama. Thus, 𝑥0 is drawn from the conditional distribution 𝑝(𝑥 𝑖0, 𝑙0). Figure 2 Our data curation leverages physical engines, utilizing realistic city assets from UE5 and animated world assets from Unity. captures 90 field of view, resulting in six perspective images that can be seamlessly stitched together. Due to its simplicity and compatibility with rendering engines, we directly collect cubemaps in the physics engine to represent the egocentric world. Notably, cubemaps, equirectangular panorama, and sphere are three representations of 360 panoramic world. The curated cubemaps will be projected to equirectangular panoramas for video generation in the world exploration stage, and projected to spherical space when changing the exploring angle. Given predefined exploration trajectories, we collect sequences of cubemaps to represent different exploration outcomes in the virtual world. By sampling large number of exploration directions uniformly, we curate an extensive dataset of world exploration scenarios, which serves as the training data for our models. Figure 3 Three panorama representations that can be transformed into one another. 4 Figure 4 From single view to 360 panorama. Our world initialization model is built up on state-of-the-art text-to-panorama model (Bilcke, 2024) tuned from the state-of-the-art textto-image model FLUX.1 (Labs, 2024). The textto-panorama model (Bilcke, 2024) generates panorama from text description 𝑙0: 𝑥0 𝑝flux(𝑥 𝑙0) . However, without being conditioned on the single image, this approach cannot guarantee the coherence of generated panorama 𝑥0 with the provided reference image 𝑖0. We extend the model to condition on both textual input and single image. This adaptation allows the model to produce full 360-degree environment that aligns with the provided image: 𝑥0 𝑝𝜃1 (𝑥 𝑖0, 𝑙0) . Although this yields coherent, image-consistent panorama, the scene remains static and does not permit dynamic movement or exploration. To enable deeper interaction within the generative world, we introduce the world transition. GenEx: Generating an Explorable World 2.3. World Transition When the agent moves within the imaginative environment, its egocentric 360 view changes, prompting world transition. We model this transition as an action-driven panoramic video generation process, transforming the previously observed panorama into new, forward-looking view as the agent progresses. 𝑡 , 𝑥1 𝑡 , ..., 𝑥𝑆 Transition objective. The goal is to sample x𝑡 = (𝑥0 𝑡 ), newly explored panoramic video, conditioned on the previous panorama 𝑥𝑆 𝑡1 and the action 𝑎𝑡 = (𝛼𝑡, 𝑑𝑡). Here, 𝛼𝑡 is the moving angle and 𝑑𝑡 is the distance. Formally, we have the transition objective: 𝑡1, 𝑎𝑡) . x𝑡 𝑝(x 𝑥𝑆 The transition procedure has core modules: Action sampling: Consider an action sequence 𝑎1:𝑇 drawn from an infinitely large action set in the Unreal Engine and Unity. We can denote the action space as: A, where = . Each element of the sequence for 𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇 is sampled from A: 𝑎𝑡 A, 𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇, As result, the entire action sequence 𝑎1:𝑇 = (𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑇 ) lies in A𝑇 . Sphere rotation: The action 𝑎𝑡 determines rotation angle 𝛼𝑡, which we apply to the spherical representation of the equirectangular panorama 𝑥𝑆 . This yields rotated equirectangular panorama 𝑥𝑆 𝑡1 : 𝑡1 = (𝑥𝑆 𝑥𝑆 𝑡1 𝑡1, 𝛼𝑡) , where is known rotation geometric transformation defined to Equation 3 in Appendix. Panoramic video generation: We next generate videos to travel in the imaginative space by distance 𝑑𝑡. Our video generator is adapted from video diffusion model conditioned on and randomly the latest explored view 𝑥𝑆 sampled noise 𝜖𝑡 (0, 𝐼): x𝑡 𝑝𝜃2 (x 𝑥𝑆 , 𝜖𝑡) . 𝑡1 𝑡1 This approach ensures that each generated panoramic video remains consistent with the prior view, while incorporating stochastic variations to represent an explorable world. 5 Figure 5 We model the world transition as panoramic video generation process. Given the last explored 360 panorama and an action that rotates the viewing sphere, the model produces sequence of newly generated panoramic views We aim to learn to produce panoramic videos that remain visually coherent on spherical surface. Without additional constraints, training on equirectangular panorama alone can result in discontinuities at the panorama edges. To address this, we adopt spherical-consistency learning, or SCL, detailed in (Lu et al., 2024), which promotes smooth and continuous imagery across all viewing directions on the sphere. In essence, the world transition step Summary. updates the agents observed 360 panorama into newly explored view sequence. Through actiondriven rotation, spherical adjustments, and diffusion-based video model, we achieve seamless transitions and maintain coherent, panoramic representations as the agent navigates the generative environment. GenEx: Generating an Explorable World 3. Exploration in the Generative World After generating the explorable world, human or embodied agents can explore the virtual world with an exploration policy, defined in 3.1. We then introduce three exploration modes in 3.2. 3.1. Exploration Policy The exploration action 𝑎𝑡 is decided by policy: 𝑎𝑡 = arg max 𝑎 𝜋𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑎𝑥𝑆 𝑡1, I), where is the instruction that specifies the exploration mode to be either human interaction or assisted by GPT, detailed in 3.2. Note that 𝑥𝑆 𝑡1 denotes the latest explored view from the previous step 𝑡 1. At 𝑡 = 1, it corresponds to the initial panorama 𝑥0. The action 𝑎𝑡 = (𝛼𝑡, 𝑑𝑡) defines how the agent rotates its field of view with the rotation angle 𝛼𝑡 and moves forward with 𝑑𝑡 distance, shaping the direction and extent of exploration. 3.2. Exploration Modes The GenEx framework enables agents to explore within an imaginative world by streaming video generation, based on current single view image 𝑖0 and the given exploration action 𝑎. We support three modes for generative world exploration, including (a) interactive exploration, (b) GPT-assisted free exploration, and (c) goaldriven navigation, illustrated in Figure 6. Interactive exploration. GenEx enables the agent to freely explore the synthetic world with an unlimited range of orientations, enhancing its understanding of the surrounding environment. Users can control the agents movement directions and distances, allowing for continuous exploration of the virtual world. GPT-assisted free exploration. However, human-provided commands can sometimes lead the model to collapse. For example, if users instruct the agent to move excessively close to wall, the resulting viewpoint may reduce the quality of subsequent generated video frames. To mitigate this, we employ GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023) as pilot to determine exploFigure 6 Three exploration modes interactive, GPT-assisted, and goal-driven each defined by distinct exploration instructions. ration configurations, encompassing full 360 explorable directions and distances. Given that generation quality can compoundingly degrade over time, GPT-4o acts as policy that selects actions to maximize the fidelity of generative worlds and avoid model collapsing. Goal-driven navigation. The agent receives goal with navigation instruction I, such as, Move to the blue cars position and orientation.\" GPT performs high-level planning based on the instruction and initial image, generating low-level exploration configurations in an iterative manner. GenEx then processes these configurations stepby-step, updating images progressively throughout the imaginative exploration. This allows for greater control and targeted exploration. GenEx: Generating an Explorable World 4. Advancing Embodied AI In our generative world, we can explore previously unobserved regions of the physical environment, gather more comprehensive information, and refine our beliefs for more informed decision-making. We frame this process in form of human-like decision-makingan imaginationaugmented policythat could play crucial role in shaping the future of embodied AI. Preliminary. We first denote common embodied policy as 𝜋𝜃( 𝐴𝑜, 𝑔) where 𝜃 is GPT-based planner, 𝑜 is the agents observation, 𝑔 is the goal to answer questions such as Danger ahead. Stop or go ahead?. Here, 𝐴 denotes higher-level embodied actions (e.g., answering the questions or generating navigation plans), which differ from the exploration actions 𝑎 introduced earlier. However, if the observation is limited to single initial image 𝑖0, then executing arg max𝐴 𝜋𝜃( 𝐴𝑜 = 𝑖0, 𝑔) may fail because it provides no visibility into unseen parts of the environment. The decision can become more informed if the agent gains clearer understanding of its surroundings (Fan et al., 2024). By navigating through the physical space, the agent gathers additional information about its environment (Physical path in the cyan color in Figure 7), enabling more accurate assessments and better choices moving forward. Nevertheless, physically traversing the space is inefficient, expensive, and even impossible in dangerous scenarios. To streamline this process, we use imagination as pathway for the agent to simulate outcomes without physically traversing (Imaginative path in purple color in Figure 7). The key question is: How can an agent make more informed decisions through exploration in generative 360 world? 4.1. Imagination-Augmented Policy We propose new policy based on imagined observations in the generative world, described in Algorithm 2. The Imagination-Augmented Policy consists of the following two steps: Step 1: Gather imagined observations sampled Figure 7 GenEx-driven imaginative exploration can gather observations that are just as informed as those obtained through physical exploration. Algorithm 2 Imagination-Augmented Policy Require: Initial observation 𝑖0 and world initialization description 𝑙0 goal 𝑔 to answer embodied questions. E.g, Danger aheadstop or go ahead? navigation instruction I. E.g, Navigate to the unseen parts of the environment. GenEx 𝑝(x0:𝑇 𝑖0, 𝑙0, I) defined in 2.1 and Algorithm 1. An embodied policy 𝜋𝜃3 ( 𝐴𝑜, 𝑔) conditioned on observation variable 𝑜 and goal 𝑔. 1: Gather imagined observations with GenEx: x0:𝑇 𝑝(x0:𝑇 𝑖0, 𝑙0, I) 2: Select an action with imagined observations to maximize the policy: 𝐴 = arg max 𝐴 𝜋𝜃( 𝐴 𝑖0, x0:𝑇 , 𝑔) from GenEx (Algorithm 1): x0:𝑇 𝑝(x0:𝑇 𝑖0, 𝑙0, I) . Step 2: Select an action conditioned on the imagined observations to maximize the policy: 𝐴 = arg max 𝐴 𝜋𝜃3 ( 𝐴 𝑖0, x0:𝑇 , 𝑔) . In our work, we apply GenEx for imaginative exploration and an LMM as the policy model 𝜋𝜃3, with examples in Figure 8. Compared to arg max𝑎 𝜋𝜃3 ( 𝐴 𝑖0, 𝑔) the common policy which selects the action based solely on real observations 𝑖0, the ImaginationAugmented Policy selects actions using both actual and imagined observations (𝑖0, x0:𝑇 ), potentially leading to more informed decisions. 7 GenEx: Generating an Explorable World Figure 8 Single agent reasoning with imagination and multi-agent reasoning and planning with imagination. (a) The single agent can imagine previously unobserved views to better understand the environment. (b) In the multi-agent scenario, the agent infers the perspective of others to make decisions based on more complete understanding of the situation. Input and generated images are panoramic; cubes are extracted for visualization. Step 2: Repeat Step 1 total of 𝐾 times, then imaginatively explore the resulting positions of all 𝐾 agents in our generated explorable world: {x(𝑘) 1:𝑇 }𝐾 𝑘=1 = (x(1) 1:𝑇 , x(2) 1:𝑇 , ..., x( 𝐾 ) 1:𝑇 ) . Step 3: Select an embodied action 𝐴 with imagined observations to maximize the policy: 𝐴 = arg max 𝐴 𝜋𝜃3 ( 𝐴 𝑖0, {x(𝑘) 1:𝑇 }𝐾 𝑘=1, 𝑔) . When exploring another agents surrounding environment, we can predict what that agent sees, understands, and might do next, which in turn helps us adjust our own actions with more complete information. 4.2. Multi-Agent Imagination-Augmented Policy Our Imagination-Augmented Policy can be generalized to the multi-agent scenario. An agent can explore the position of other agents. This predicts other agents observations and infers their understanding of the surrounding environments. Technically, we can create multiple exploration paths by providing instructions like navigate to the position of agent-k. The agent can then explore the generated 360 environment to reach agent-ks location. By extending Algorithm 2, the Multi-Agent Imagination-Augmented Policy has three steps: Step 1: Gather imagined observations by exploring the position to agent-k using Algorithm 1, with instruction I𝑘 navigate to the position of agent-k: x(𝑘) 0:𝑇 𝑝(x0:𝑇 𝑖0, 𝑙0, I𝑘) . 8 GenEx: Generating an Explorable World 5. Applications 5.1. Generation Quality We evaluate the video generation quality using FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2019), SSIM (Wang et al., 2004), LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018), and PSNR (Horé and Ziou, 2010). Table 1 shows our earlier GenEx version (Lu et al., 2024) has high video quality in all metrics. Model Representation FVD MSE LPIPS PSNR SSIM Baseline 6-view cubemaps 196.7 0.10 0.09 GenEx w/o SCL panorama 81.9 0. 0.05 26.1 29.4 0.88 0.91 GenEx panorama 69.5 0.04 0.03 30.2 0. Table 1 GenEx with high generation quality. 5.2. Exploration Loop Consistency We propose Imaginative Exploration Loop Consistency (IELC) to measure long-range exploration fidelity. For each randomly sampled closedloop path, we compute the latent MSE between the initial real image and the final generated image, and then average these values over 1000 loops with varying rotations and distances, discarding blocked paths. As shown in Figure 9, the IELC remains high even for 20m loops and multiple consecutive videos, maintaining latent MSE below 0.1 and thus indicating minimal drift. This robustness stems from preserving spherical consistency, ensuring that rotations do not compromise image quality. 5.3. Generating Birds-Eye Worlds By exploring upward along the z-axis, our method generates top-down (birds-eye view) maps directly from single panoramic image. As shown in Figure 10, these overhead layouts give the agent an objective, third-person understanding of the scene, thereby improving reasoning. Figure 10 Through generative exploration in z-axis, we are able to generate the 2D bird-eye world view of the current scene. 5.4. 3D Consistency Our method enables the generation of multi-view videos of an object through imaginative exploration with path circling around it. Our model demonstrates superior performance compared with the SOTA open-source models. Importantly, it maintains near-perfect background consistency and effectively simulates scene lighting, object orientation, and 3D relationships as in Figure 11. Figure 9 Imaginative Exploration Loop Consistency (IELC) varying distance and rotations. Figure 11 Through exploration, our model achieves higher quality in novel view synthesis for objects and better consistency in background synthesis, compared to SOTA 3D reconstruction models (StabilityAI, 2023; Tochilkin et al., 2024; Voleti et al., 2024). 9 GenEx: Generating an Explorable World 5.5. Active 3D Mapping in Generated Worlds When the agent actively explores the generative world, it continuously gathers observations that can be leveraged to reconstruct 3D map using DUSt3R (Wang et al., 2024b), shown in Figure 12. Figure 12 Active 3D mapping from single image. 5.6. Embodied Decision Making We next evaluate the Imagination-Augmented Policy proposed in 4 and share two key findings. Evaluation. We evaluate our ImaginationAugmented Policy (4.1) in Table 2. We extend the Genex-EQA in (Lu et al., 2024) with controlled counterpart for each scenario. We use Unimodal to refer to agents receiving only text context, while Multimodal reasoning demonstrates LLM decision when prompted along with an egocentric visual view. GenEx shows the performance of models equipped as agents with generative world explorer. We evaluate our Multi-Agent Imagination-Augmented Policy (4.2) in Table 3. Method"

We identified two findings based on the results from human policy ( grey row ) and GenEx-enhanced GPT policy ( blue row ). Vision without imagination can be misleading for GPTs. Interestingly, unimodal response that relies solely on the environments text description often outperforms its multimodal counterparts, which incorporate both text and egocentric visual inputs. This suggests that vision without imagination can be misleading, as it may lead to incorrect inferences due to the lack of spatial context and relying only on languagebased commonsense reasoning. This highlights the importance of integrating visual imagination to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the agents decision-making processes. GenEx has the potential to enhance cognitive abilities for humans. Human performance results reveal several key insights. First, individuals using both visual and textual information achieve significantly higher decision accuracy compared to those relying solely on text. This indicates that multimodal inputs enhance reasoning. Secondly, when provided with imagined videos generated by GenEx, humans make even more accurate and informed decisions than in the conventional image-only setting, especially in multi-agent scenarios that require advanced spatial reasoning. These findings demonstrate GenExs potential to enhance cognitive abilities for effective social collaboration and situational awareness. GenEx: Generating an Explorable World 6. Discussion 7. Conclusion Related works. Advances in single-image 3D modeling (Tewari et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024) enable novel view synthesis but are limited by render distances or fields of view, relying heavily on depth estimator. Meanwhile, video generation methods (Blattmann et al., 2023; Kondratyuk et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024) excel at producing diverse videos but often lack physical grounding, reducing their utility for exploration. Video generation models (Bu et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024a,b; Wang et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024) are capable of directly synthesizing visual plans for decision-making, but world exploration for imagined observations remains unexamined. Our approach unites these domains by drawing on physically grounded data to generate 3D-consistent, explorable worlds and advance embodied AI. Extension to our earlier work. Our earlier work (Lu et al., 2024), published on arXiv in November 2024, conceptualized world transitions, exploration, and applications in embodied AI, but it did not address the crucial aspect of world initialization from single image. Relation to concurrent industrial progress. WorldLabs (WorldLabs, 2024) recently released demos of anime-world generation from single image. DeepMind (DeepMind, 2024) released blog on interactive world models. Our work complements these ongoing industrial efforts, jointly contributing toward shared vision: creating rich, interactive, 3D-consistent generative worlds. Importantly, we offer our technical details. Beyond this, we also introduce the concept of an Imagination-Augmented Policy by exploring the generative world, further expanding the frontiers of embodied AI. Challenges. Bridging imaginative and realworld environments remains core challenge in AI. Current approaches rely on physical engines. Future work must address several key limitations, including sim-to-real adaptation, real sensor integration, dynamic conditions, and ethical safeguards, to ultimately enable reliable deployment of embodied AI in diverse physical settings. We introduce GenEx, platform that Generates an Explorable world and enables agents, either instructed by human users or GPT, to freely explore in this imaginative panoramic world. By generating 3D-consistent environments from single image, our approach enables the creation of immersive and interactive worlds offering boundless landscape, grounded in the physical world, and explored by agents. We demonstrate diverse applications of GenEx, showing that this generative explorable world technique can create diverse and consistent 3D environments, build active 3D mappings, and advance embodied decision-making by allowing agents to create more informed and effective plans. Furthermore, GenExs framework supports multi-agent interactions, paving the way for more advanced and cooperative AI systems. This work marks an advancement toward real-world navigation, interactive gaming, and achieving human-like intelligence in embodied AI."

Preliminary: Equirectangular Panorama Images Figure 13 Left: Pixel Grid coordinate and Spherical Polar coordinate systems; Middle: rotation in Spherical coordinates corresponds to rotation in 2D image; Right: expansion from panorama to cubemap or composition in reverse. A.1.1. Coordinate Systems An Equirectangular Panorama Image captures all perspectives from an egocentric viewpoint into 2D image. Essentially, it represents spherical coordinate system on 2D grid. Definition D.1 (Spherical polar coordinate system). S: Taking the origin as the central point, point in this system is represented by coordinates (𝜙, 𝜃, 𝑟) S, where 𝜙 denotes the longitude, 𝜃 the latitude, and 𝑟 the radial distance from the origin. The ranges for these coordinates are 𝜙 [𝜋, 𝜋), 𝜃 [𝜋/2, 𝜋/2], and 𝑟 > 0. Definition D.2 (Cartesian coordinate system for panoramic image). P: In this system, pixel is identified by the coordinates (𝑢, 𝑣) P, where 𝑢 and 𝑣 correspond to the column and row positions on the 2D panoramic image plane, respectively. Here, 𝑢 ranges from 0 to 𝑊 1 and 𝑣 ranges from 0 to 𝐻 1. Definition D.3 (Sphere-to-Cartesian Coordinate Transformation). The transformation between the spherical polar coordinates and the panoramic pixel grid coordinates can be defined by the following functions: 𝑓SP (𝜙, 𝜃) = 𝑓PS (𝑢, 𝑣) = (cid:18) 𝑊 2𝜋 (cid:18) 2𝜋𝑢 𝑊 (𝜙 + 𝜋), 𝜋, 𝜋 2 (cid:17) (cid:19) 𝜃 (cid:19) 𝐻 𝜋 (cid:16) 𝜋 2 𝜋𝑣 𝐻 (1) (2) Here, the function 𝑓SP maps the spherical coordinates (𝜙, 𝜃) to the pixel coordinates (𝑢, 𝑣), and the inverse function 𝑓PS maps the pixel coordinates (𝑢, 𝑣) back to the spherical coordinates (𝜙, 𝜃). This transformation ensures that the entire spherical surface is represented on the 2D panoramic image. Panorama effectively stores every perspective of the world from single location. In our work, due to the nature of panoramic images, we are able to preserve the global context during spatial navigation. This allows us to maintain consistency in world information from the conditional image, ensuring that the generated content aligns coherently with the surrounding environment. 13 GenEx: Generating an Explorable World A.1.2. Panorama Image transformations The spherical format allows various image processing tasks. For example, the image can be rotated by an arbitrary angle without any loss of information due to the spherical representation. Additionally, it can be broken down into cubemaps for 2D visualization, as shown in Figure 13. Definition D.4 (Rotation Transformation in Spherical Polar Coordinate System). Since panorama image is in spherical format, we can rotate the image to face different angle while preserving the original image quality. The rotation can be performed using the following formula: (𝑢, 𝑣, Δ𝜙, Δ𝜃) = 𝑓SP (R ( 𝑓PS (𝑢, 𝑣), Δ𝜙, Δ𝜃)) Where the rotation function is defined as: (𝜙, 𝜃, Δ𝜙, Δ𝜃) = (𝜙 + Δ𝜙 (mod 2𝜋), 𝜃 + Δ𝜃 (mod 𝜋)) If there is no explicit input, both Δ𝜙 and Δ𝜃 can be set to 0.
