            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs), built upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), have achieved remarkable progress in tasks such as machine translation, text classification, and generative dialogue. Despite these advances, their performance remains highly uneven across languages, favoring high-resource languages and marginalizing underrepresented ones (Li et al., 2024). This imbalance deepens the digital language divide and limits the inclusivity of NLP technologies. Recent work on Continual Pretraining (CPT) has shown promise for adapting pretrained models to new languages through additional training on targeted data (Zheng et al., 2024a). EMMA-500 employed CPT with extensive monolingual datasets across more than 500 languages, significantly improving multilingual performance, particularly for low-resource languages (Ji et al., 2024a). LLaMAX achieved notable translation improvements through CPT on over 100 languages involving data augmentation with bilingual translation data (Lu et al., 2024). Similar effects could be demonstrated on translation tasks with the CPT-based TOWER model (Alves et al., 2024). However, the relative effectiveness of monolingual and bilingual translation data for CPT remains unclear, particularly in terms of their impact on continual language learning, language interference, and performance consistency across different resource levels of languages. Corresponding author 1 Preprint. Under review. In addition to textual data in natural languages, growing practice in LLM training is to incorporate programming code as an additional source of information. Previous research indicates that incorporating code enhances reasoning capabilities and improves the ability to handle structured information (Petty et al., 2024; Aryabumi et al., 2024), but its role in multilingual context remains underexplored. There is critical gap in understanding how language characteristics interact with CPT strategies. recent classification proposed by Yuan et al. (2024) categorizes languages as altruistic, selfish, and stagnant based on their cross-lingual transfer patterns. However, this classification has only been validated in narrow experimental settings using English-centric bilingual data, leaving open questions about its generalizability to: (1) non-English language pairs, (2) code-augmented training regimes, and (3) models with varying pretraining corpora and architectures. To systematically assess the impact of different CPT strategies, we conduct extensive experiments with 36 configurations, evaluating monolingual, bilingual, and code-augmented CPT on multilingual adaptation.1 Our setup includes three multilingual base modelsLlama3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024), Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), and Viking-7B (Luukkonen et al., 2025)continual-pretrained languages spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource categories. We evaluate the model performance on 14 training languages and assess crosslingual transfer on 25 related languages, with particular focus on assessing how different CPT configurations perform across altruistic, selfish, and stagnant language categories by Yuan et al. (2024). Our systematic evaluation of 36 CPT configurations across three base models and 30+ languages yields three core insights: Bilingual CPT improves classification performance but introduces generation challenges: Compared to monolingual CPT, bilingual CPT generally improves multilingual classification accuracy for mediumand low-resource languages. However, it frequently results in problematic language mixing during generation tasks, limiting its overall utility. Code data enhances classification but introduces trade-offs in generation: Adding code data during CPT significantly boosts multilingual classification performance across resource levels, especially for low-resource languages, acting as an effective scaffold for representation learning. Nevertheless, code inclusion may lead to trade-off, slightly degrading generation quality in certain scenarios. The categorization of languages according to their cross-lingual transfer abilities does not generalize under varying conditions: Our experiments reveal substantial deviations from language classifications proposed in previous work (Yuan et al., 2024): so-called altruistic languages are not always helpful and often negatively impact related languages, selfish languages exhibit highly configuration-dependent cross-lingual effects, and languages classified as stagnant demonstrate unexpected adaptability under specific training settings. These findings highlight the complexity of multilingual interactions in CPT and emphasize the need for more adaptive classification framework for cross-lingual learning."

            "content": "2.1 Language Selection We systematically evaluate the effects of CPT on multilingual models by selecting languages according to the altruistic, selfish, and stagnant categories defined in Yuan et al. (2024), which classify languages based on their behavior in multilingual training and evaluation. 1Monolingual data consists of texts in single language, though it may include code-switching. Bilingual translation data contains sentence pairs in two languages that convey the same meaning. When monolingual data from different languages is combined, it forms multilingual continual pertaining, and similar principle applies to bilingual translation data. However, for clarity, we refer to these setups as monolingual CPT and bilingual CPT, respectively. 2 Preprint. Under review. For each category, we select 1 high-resource language (except for the stagnant category for which no high-resource language is available in the dataset we use), 2 medium-resource languages, and 2 low-resource languages to ensure balanced representation across different resource levels. The classification of languages into high-, medium-, and low-resource categories is determined by analyzing the data distribution of the Lego-MT dataset (Yuan et al., 2023), which serves as the basis for our setup. Specifically, we calculate the total token count for each language. Languages are then categorized as follows: high-resource languages exceed 1 billion tokens, medium-resource languages range between 10 million and 1 billion tokens, and low-resource languages fall below 10 million tokens. These languages serve as the training languages in our CPT experiments. The selected training languages, along with their corresponding category and resource level, are summarized in the first three columns of Table 1. To further validate the findings in Yuan et al. (2024), we select 1-2 linguistically related languages for each training language based on the language evolutionary tree23. These related languages are not included in the CPT phase but are used for cross-lingual evaluation to determine whether the effects observed in training languages extend to unseen but related languages. The fourth and fifth columns of Table 1 list the selected related languages. For some languages, this includes one, and for others, two related languages that are available in the evaluation benchmarks.

            "content": "Bilingual Translation Data We utilize subsets of the Lego-MT (Yuan et al., 2023) and NLLB (Schwenk et al., 2021; Heffernan et al., 2022; Costa-juss`a et al., 2022) datasets as our sources of parallel bilingual data. The Lego-MT dataset, derived from OPUS4, provides translations across 433 languages. The NLLB dataset consists of 148 English-centric and 1,465 non-English-centric bitext pairs mined from different parallel sources. To construct our parallel training data, we select specific language pairs from these datasets and apply OpusFilter (Aulamo et al., 2020) to remove duplicate data points. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 292 million tokens across 22 language pairs, distributed over three language categories: altruistic (10 pairs, 92M tokens), selfish (8 pairs, 100M tokens), and stagnant (4 pairs, 100M tokens). For training, we format parallel data using the following structure: 2http://www.elinguistics.net/Language Evolutionary Tree.html 3Using the language evolutionary tree to identify related languages, we assess whether CPT effects transfer to unseen but linguistically similar languages, thus evaluating cross-lingual robustness. 4https://opus.nlpl.eu 3 Preprint. Under review. [source language]: [source] [target language]: [target] Monolingual Data We extract subset of MADLAD-400 (Kudugunta et al., 2024), large-scale multilingual dataset derived from Common Crawl5, covering 419 languages. Since web-crawled text does not inherently guarantee monolingual integrity, we employ GlotLID (Kargaran et al., 2023), language identification model, to analyze the language composition of each text segment and ensure strict monolingual consistency. Specifically, for each document in the dataset, we first segment the text into sentences using the NLTK (Bird & Loper, 2004) sentence splitter. Then, GlotLID predicts the language of each sentence independently. We retain only those documents where all sentences are identified as belonging to the same language, discarding any text segment that exhibits code-switching or multilingual content. We finally select data for 15 languages across our three categories: altruistic (6 languages, 92M tokens), selfish (6 languages, 100M tokens), and stagnant (5 languages including English, 87M tokens), resulting in total of approximately 279 million tokens. Code Data We incorporate code data from The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022), following the pre-processing strategy used in EMMA-500 (Ji et al., 2024a). The dataset is first filtered to retain high-quality source files, with focus on data science-related code and the 32 most commonly used general-purpose programming languages. Additionally, we include LLVM code due to its importance in multilingual code generation (Paul et al., 2024; Szafraniec et al., 2022). For training configurations that include code, we maintain 2:1 ratio between textual (monolingual/bilingual) and code data, with code comprising about 33% of the total tokens. This aligns with prior work (Aryabumi et al., 2024), which recommends 25% code proportion (text:code 3:1) for balancing language and code performance, noting that 33% remains reasonable for enhancing reasoning tasks. We sample the code dataset down to 50 million tokens, matching the 100 million tokens of textual data. 2.3 Base Models We evaluate across three open-source multilingual LLMs with diverse training recipes: Llama-3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024) is pretrained on approximately 15 trillion tokens from diverse, multilingual sources. Its extensive multilingual pretraining and high capacity make it ideal for analyzing CPT effects on well-trained models. Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) is pretrained on 2 trillion tokens, covering broad yet less multilingual data distribution. It provides baseline to evaluate CPT effectiveness on English-centric models commonly used in multilingual adaptation research. Viking-7B (Luukkonen et al., 2025) is pretrained mainly on Nordic languages, English, and code, offering insights into how CPT impacts models initially trained on narrower, region-specific data. 2.4 CPT Configurations We train models under 4 CPT configurations across 3 base models and 3 language categories, resulting in total of 36 models. Each model is named using the format: Model-Data[+Code]-LangCat where: Model {L3 (Llama-3.1-8B), L2 (Llama-2-7B), V7 (Viking-7B)} Data {Mono (Monolingual), Bi (Bilingual)} 5https://commoncrawl.org/ 4 Preprint.

Each model is trained for 2 epochs on cluster with 4 AMD MI250X GPUs (8 Graphics Compute Dies) on each node. Training data is organized by language category (altruistic, selfish, stagnant), with all languages within category (e.g., altruistic: zho Hani, ceb Latn, etc.) mixed into single dataset per configuration (e.g., monolingual, bilingual+code). As for software, we use the LLaMA-Factory (Zheng et al., 2024b) framework with DeepSpeed (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) ZeRO-3 config. The hyperparameter setup includes per-device batch size of 8 with gradient accumulation steps of 2.

            "content": "3.1 Benchmarks and Setup We evaluate our models on two highly multilingual benchmarks covering classification and generation task: SIB-200 (Adelani et al., 2024) for topic classification and FLORES200 (Costa-juss`a et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2022; Guzman et al., 2019) for machine translation. Classification focuses on whether CPT improves the multilingual models understanding within single language, while translation studies the alignment between languages that emerges with multilingual CPT. All experiments use consistent 3-shot prompting setup. SIB-200 SIB-200 is multilingual news topic classification benchmark covering 200 languages. The task involves classifying news headlines into one of the following predefined categories: science/technology, travel, politics, sports, health, entertainment, and geography. The model predicts by ranking logits for each category, and accuracy measures performance across languages. FLORES-200 FLORES-200 evaluates multilingual translation performance across diverse language pairs. Translations are generated using the vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) inference engine. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores, computed via SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) with the flores200 tokenizer, quantify translation quality. 6BLEU signature: nrefs:1case:mixedeff:notok:flores200smooth:expversion:2.4.2 5 Preprint.

            "title": "3.2.1 Language Mixing in Generation Tasks",
            "content": "The FLORES-200 translation task revealed significant language mixing issues in models trained with bilingual translation data. Specifically, when generating translations between language pairs, models frequently appended unintended language tokens to the output. For example, when translating from English (eng Latn) to Chinese (zho Hani), models trained on bilingual data produced outputs like: The text with green background represents the desired Chinese translation, while the text with an orange background contains nonsensical multilingual fragments. This phenomenon occurred consistently across bilingual CPT configurations, suggesting that the parallel data format ([Lang1]: xxx [Lang2]: yyy) encourages cross-lingual interference. More examples are in Figure 6 in Appendix A.5. This language inconsistency leads to significant translation quality degradation, as shown in Figure 1. Bilingual CPT configurations underperform monolingual CPT across all resource levels and base models. For high-resource languages, Llama-3.1-8B achieves only 7.47 BLEU with bilingual CPT versus 25.52 with monolingual CPT (-71% relative), while Llama-2-7B shows similar disparities (14.12 vs 24.60, -43%). The pattern persists for midand low-resource languages, with bilingual CPT consistently lagging behind monolingual CPT. Notably, monolingual CPT often matches or exceeds baseline performance, whereas bilingual CPT only exceeds baseline in specific cases, such as Llama-2-7B on midand low-resource languages. Appendix A.4 presents the detailed results on each language. Figure 1: FLORES-200 X-Eng BLEU score comparing bilingual and monolingual CPT across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. 3.2.2 Comparative Analysis in Classification Tasks To isolate the effects of CPT strategies without interference from language mixing, we evaluate SIB-200 classification accuracy. Figure 2 shows the average accuracy aggregated across models trained separately on altruistic, selfish, and stagnant languages, grouped by resource level. High-Resource Languages For high-resource languages, both monolingual and bilingual CPT degrade performance across all base models compared to their respective baselines. Llama-3.1-8B, despite its strong baseline (76.63%), exhibits drops with bilingual CPT (71.41%, -6.8% relative) and monolingual CPT (64.21%, -16.2%). Llama-2-7B shows significant declines with both strategies: bilingual CPT reduces accuracy to 31.54% (vs baseline 37.75%, -16.5%), 6 Preprint. Under review. Figure 2: SIB-200 classification accuracy comparing monolingual and bilingual CPT across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. while monolingual CPT performs similarly (31.86%, -15.6%). Viking-7B partially escapes this trend, with bilingual CPT achieving marginal gains (36.60% vs baseline 34.80%, +5.2%), though monolingual CPT underperforms (25.98%, -25.3%). This suggests that high-resource languages generally do not benefit from CPT, likely due to interference with existing strong representations in pretrained models. However, model-specific factors, such as whether the models pretraining data aligns well with the target languages in CPT, may enable limited improvements in certain cases. For example, Viking-7B, which was pretrained primarily on Nordic languages and English, may benefit more from bilingual CPT due to its ability to leverage cross-lingual transfer between related languages. Mid-Resource Languages Mid-resource languages show mixed trends. Llama-3.1-8B maintains near-baseline performance with bilingual CPT (64.05% vs baseline 65.85%, -2.7%), but monolingual CPT degrades significantly (52.53%, -20.2%). Llama-2-7B struggles across both configurations, with bilingual CPT reducing accuracy to 24.26% (vs baseline 20.59%, +17.8%) and monolingual CPT performing slightly better (26.80%, +30.2%). Viking-7B uniquely benefits from bilingual CPT (29.74% vs baseline 23.94%, +24.2%), while monolingual CPT underperforms (24.02%, +0.3%). This indicates that bilingual CPT can stabilize mid-resource language performance for certain models (e.g., Viking-7B and Llama-2-7B). However, monolingual CPT risks overfitting to limited in-language data, particularly for models with weaker pretraining (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B). Low-Resource Languages Low-resource languages exhibit divergent patterns. Llama3.1-8B improves with bilingual CPT (62.91% vs baseline 56.86%, +10.6%) but declines with monolingual CPT (52.04%, -8.5%). Llama-2-7B degrades significantly with bilingual CPT (20.84%, +19.8%) and shows minimal gains with monolingual CPT (24.51%, +40.9%). Viking7B benefits substantially from bilingual CPT (29.25%, +66.5%), while monolingual CPT slightly underperforms (21.33%, +21.4%). This highlights that bilingual CPT can enhance low-resource language performance for models with compatible pretraining (e.g., Viking-7B and Llama-3.1-8B). 3.3 Effect of Including Code Data The integration of code data during monolingual CPT shows task-dependent effects, enhancing classification performance while introducing tradeoffs in generation quality. Figure 3 and Figure 4 compare monolingual CPT with and without code data across resource levels and tasks, revealing key patterns in how code data influences multilingual adaptation. Code integration consistently improves classification accuracy across all resource levels and models. For high-resource languages, Llama-3.1-8B shows marginal gains (64.21% to 68.47%, +6.7% relative to baseline 76.63%), while Llama-2-7B and Viking-7B exhibit more substantial improvements (42.48% vs 31.86%, +33.3%; 30.88% vs 25.98%, +18.8%). Mid-resource languages benefit even more, with Llama-3.1-8B recovering near-baseline performance (52.53% to 62.83%, -4.6% vs baseline 65.85%) and Llama-2-7B achieving significant gains (34.40% vs 26.80%, +67.0%). Low-resource languages see the most pronounced improvements, partic7 Preprint. Under review. ularly for Viking-7B (28.68% vs 21.33%, +63.2% relative to baseline 17.57%). This pattern extends to bilingual CPT configurations (see Appendix A.2). In contrast, code integration often degrades translation quality, particularly for high-resource languages. Llama-3.1-8B shows slight degradation (25.52 BLEU to 25.35, -0.7% vs baseline 27.97), while Llama-2-7B and Viking-7B exhibit gains (25.05 vs 24.60, +8.6%; 11.69 vs 9.18, +27.3%). Mid-resource languages show mixed trends, with Llama-3.1-8B experiencing slight drop (17.62 vs 18.59, -5.2%) and Viking-7B improving significantly (4.21 vs 3.58, +52.0%). Low-resource languages partially escape this trend, with Viking-7B showing substantial gains (2.84 vs 2.31, +37.4%). The benefits of code integration are most pronounced for low-resource languages, where it acts as scaffold to improve classification accuracy (avg. +25.1%) and partially mitigate generation deficits. Mid-resource languages also benefit, though to lesser extent, while high-resource languages see diminishing returns, with classification gains (e.g., Llama-3.18B: +6.7%) offset by generation losses.

Figure 4: FLORES-200 X-Eng BLEU score comparing monolingual and monolingual+code CPT across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. 3.4 Validation of Language Category Hypotheses This section evaluates the validity of the altruistic, selfish, and stagnant language classifications proposed in prior work (Yuan et al., 2024). We evaluate each model (e.g., L3-Mono-Alt) trained on language category (e.g., altruistic languages: zho Hani, ceb Latn, etc.) and measure SIB-200 classification accuracy changes on both the trained languages and their related languages (e.g., yue Hant, tgl Latn, etc.), as defined in Table 1. We analyze whether CPT strategies align with these hypothesized behaviors. Table 3 reports accuracy changes (%) relative to base models. Altruistic languages can also be selfish or mutually harmful The altruistic hypothesis indicates that training in altruistic languages enhances multilingual performance (related languages) with minimal impact on their own performance (trained languages). Our results 8 Preprint. Under review. Table 3: SIB-200 classification accuracy changes (%) for training and related languages across altruistic, selfish, and stagnant categories.

No No No No No No No No No No Yes No reveal three critical contradictions: (1) 83% of configurations (10/12) degraded related language performance, with code-free CPT causing up to -31.32% accuracy (L2-Mono-Alt); (2) Contrary to minimal self-impact, trained language accuracy fluctuated wildly (+62.37% in L2-Bi+Code-Alt vs. -24.37% in L3-Mono-Alt); These bidirectional effects challenge the unidirectional altruism assumption. Selfish languages exhibit conditional isolation only in certain cases While the selfish hypothesis suggests trained languages primarily improve their own performance (trained languages) while minimally affecting others (related languages), we find this only holds in specific configurations: (1) Non-code bilingual training (L2-Bi-Sel) showed minimal impact on related languages (+2.90%); (2) Code-augmented monolingual training (V7Mono+Code-Sel) achieved strong self-improvement (+53.96%) with moderate spillover (+8.18%). However, 83% of cases (10/12) violated the hypothesis through either negative spillover (V7-Mono-Sel: -33.45%) or excessive cross-lingual transfer (L2-Bi+Code-Sel: +31.67%). Stagnant languages demonstrate more adaptability than expected Stagnant languages neither improve their own performance (trained languages) nor influence others Contrary to their purported stagnation, 92% of configurations (11/12) induced significant performance shifts: (1) Bilingual training boosted trained languages by +78.18% (V7-Bi-Stag) while improving related languages (+26.13%); (2) Monolingual+code CPT (L2-Mono+Code-Stag) achieved +64% self-improvement with +14.76% cross-lingual gains. Only V7-Mono-Stag showed true stagnation (+0.00% trained, -0.83% related). This reveals that most stagnant languages possess untapped adaptation potential under proper CPT strategies."

            "content": "In this study, we systematically evaluated the effects of multilingual CPT strategies, including monolingual, bilingual, and code-augmented configurations, across diverse resource levels and language categories. Through experiments with 36 configurations involving three multilingual base models and over 30 languages, we identified several critical insights: First, while bilingual CPT enhances classification accuracy for midand low-resource languages, it introduces language mixing during generation, limiting its utility for translation tasks. Second, code integration during CPT acts as scaffold for low-resource language understanding but introduces task-dependent trade-offs, improving classification while slightly degrading generation quality. Third, we demonstrate that language classifications based on cross-lingual transfer patterns (altruistic, selfish, stagnant) fail to generalize under varying CPT strategies. 9 Preprint. Under review. Overall, our work underscores the complexity of multilingual representation learning and highlights the need for flexible frameworks for language categorization and training strategy selection. Future research should focus on developing more adaptive CPT methods that balance classification improvements and generation quality, further bridging language disparities in large language models."

            "title": "A Appendix",
            "content": "A.1 Related Work Continual Pretraining Continual pretraining has emerged as pivotal technique for adapting LLMs to new domains or languages while retaining previously acquired knowledge (Yıldız et al., 2024). This approach has demonstrated significant benefits across diverse domains, including cybersecurity (Yu et al., 2025), finance(Hirano & Imajo, 2024), and law (Niyogi & Bhattacharya, 2024). In the context of language adaptation, researchers have successfully leveraged continual pretraining to enhance performance on lowand mediumresource languages. For instance, Ji et al. (2024a); Lu et al. (2024) extended the capabilities of open-weight LLMs by pretraining them on multilingual datasets encompassing hundreds of languages. Similarly, Fujii et al. (2024) significantly improved Japanese language proficiency by continually pretraining LLama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) on large-scale Japanese web corpus. In another study, Vo et al. (2024) achieved notable advancements in Korean language processing by utilizing 9.7 billion tokens for continual pretraining. Bilingual Translation Data Incorporating bilingual translation data into pretraining has been shown to enhance multilingual performance, although the benefits tend to diminish as model size increases (Kale et al., 2021). Even relatively small parallel corpora, such as 10,000 sentence pairs, can be as effective as much larger datasets when carefully filtered for quality (Lin et al., 2024). Recent efforts further highlight how strategically leveraging bilingual data can enhance multilingual capabilities. For example, Ranaldi et al. (2024) introduced Translation-following demonstrations to improve semantic alignment between English and other languages during instruction tuning. Their CrossAlpaca models, trained with both instruction and translation data, significantly outperformed monolingual baselines on multilingual QA tasks. Similarly, Alves et al. (2024) showed that including high-quality parallel data during continual pretraining, alongside monolingual data, leads to substantial improvements in translation and related tasks. In contrast to the improvement from training with bilingual translation data, Ji et al. (2024b) found that utilizing bilingual translation to enforce sentence-level alignment during continual pretraining actually hinders cross-lingual transfer based on the study on mBART (Tang et al., 2021). Code Data in Language Model Training Including code in pretraining data has become common practice, even for models not specifically designed for code generation (Chen et al., 2021). Recent studies show that code data not only improves performance on programming tasks but also enhances general capabilities such as natural language reasoning, entity tracking, and commonsense understanding (Aryabumi et al., 2024). For instance, models trained with code exhibit stronger performance in structured reasoning tasks (Madaan et al., 2022) and demonstrate better entity tracking compared to purely text-trained counterparts (Kim et al., 2024). Furthermore, adding high-quality or synthetic code during pretraining or cooldown leads to consistent gains across wide range of benchmarks (Aryabumi et al., 2024). Systematic experiments also suggest that mixing code data during both pretraining and instruction tuning stages leads to better reasoning abilities without harming performance on non-code tasks (Ma et al., 2023). 14 Preprint. Under review. A.2 Additional Results on Bilingual CPT with Code Data Figure 5 shows the impact of adding code data to bilingual CPT configurations for the SIB-200 classification task. While Section 3.3 in the main text focuses on monolingual CPT comparisons, the results in this section demonstrate that code integration also benefits bilingual CPT across most models and language resource levels for natural language understanding. For high-resource languages, the improvements are modest but consistent: Llama-3.1-8B increases from 71.41% to 72.39% (+1.4% relative), Viking-7B from 36.60% to 39.21% (+7.1%), and Llama-2-7B shows the largest gain (31.54% to 38.56%, +22.3%). Midresource languages exhibit similar patterns, with Llama-2-7B improving from 24.26% to 33.50% (+38.0%) and Llama-3.1-8B from 64.05% to 65.77% (+2.7%). Notably, Viking-7B shows slight degradation (29.74% to 26.96%, -9.3%), suggesting model-specific sensitivities to code interference in this configuration. The most significant benefits emerge for low-resource languages, Llama-2-7B improves from 20.84% to 28.51% (+36.8% relative), outperforming its baseline of 17.40%. Llama-3.1-8B sees moderate gain (62.91% to 64.54%, +2.6%), while Viking-7B experiences slight decline (29.25% to 24.84%, -15.1%). For detailed per-language results on the SIB-200 benchmark, refer to Appendix A.3 We intentionally omit FLORES-200 comparisons between bilingual and bilingual+code configurations because the fundamental language mixing issue identified in generation tasks as described in Section 3.2.1 makes this comparison nonsensical. As reference, per-language BLEU scores are available in Appendix A.4. Figure 5: SIB-200 classification accuracy comparing bilingual and bilingual+code CPT across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. A.3 SIB-200 Accuracy The SIB-200 accuracy results are detailed across language categories: Table 4 presents scores for altruistic languages, Table 5 for selfish languages, and Table 6 for stagnant languages, covering various models and languages within each category.

Training language rows have shaded background. A.5 Language Mixing Examples This section supplements the main text with examples of language mixing in bilingual CPT (L3-Bi-), where translations contain unintended multilingual fragments. For comparison, outputs from monolingual CPT (L3-Mono-) are provided, showing cleaner, target-languageonly results. Individual BLEU scores are included to quantify quality. Language mixing reduces BLEU scores by introducing irrelevant tokens that disrupt n-gram precision, as these fragments fail to match the reference translations target-language sequences, lowering overlap, especially for higher-order n-grams like the default 4-grams in SacreBLEU (Post, 2018), where single irrelevant token disrupts multiple overlapping sequences. Figure 6 illustrates the four examples and the translation generated by monolingual and bilingual CPT models. 16 Preprint. Under review.

A.6 Prompt Templates For the SIB-200 classification task, we adopt the following template: Classification: Topic sports, health, entertainment, geography. {examples} The topic of the news \"{text}\" is science/technology, travel, politics, For the FLORES-200 translation task, we employ the following 3-shot prompt: Translate the following sentence from {src lang} to {tgt lang} {examples} [{src lang}]: {src sent} [{tgt lang}]: A.7 Data Statistics The data statistics presented in Tables 13 and 14 summarize the bilingual translation and monolingual training datasets used in this study. Token counts in the two tables are calculated by splitting text on whitespace, method chosen for its computational efficiency given the large volume of data. For code data, we provide raw token counts from The Stack dataset across 32 programming languages in Table 15, totaling 51,253,373,176 tokens. We then downsample this to 49,999,171 tokens as counted by using the GPT-2 tokenizer (Radford et al., 2019), selected for its speed, to match the training dataset setup in Subsection 2.2. 18 Preprint.
