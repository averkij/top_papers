            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for diverse range of tasks (OpenAI et al., 2024a; Grattafiori et al., 2024), serving users from highly skilled professionals to non-technical individuals (Bommasani et al., 2022). To ensure safety and reduce harmful outputs of LLMs, various alignment techniques and guardrails have been implemented (Dai et al., 2024; Biswas and Talukdar, 2023; Bai et al., 2022a,b; Ganguli et al., 2022; Markov et al., 2023). However, despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that societal biases1 remain deeply embedded in model behavior and can resurface through jailbreak attempts (Jin et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023) . Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks that breach LLMs safety mechanisms, leading to It is critical to detect these harmful responses. loopholes so that they can be patched. These harmful responses reinforce stereotypes and marginalize (historically) vulnerable demographics (Sheng et al., 2021), challenging the ethical deployment of LLMs (Bender et al., 2021). These biases mainly stem from the explicit or implicit presence of toxic, stereotypical, and harmful content in pretraining data (Thaler et al., 2024; Jeoung et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024b). Beyond the models themselves, biases may also be amplified during user interactions with LLMs, as LLMs can be user pleasers and users may selectively interpret outputs that confirm their existing beliefs (Gallegos et al., 2024; Bubeck et al., 2023; Allan et al., 2025; Salecha et al., 2024). Existing LLM jailbreak methods typically require technical knowledge or dozens of queries (Cui et al., 2025). Ideally, model developers make attacks short-lived by quickly patching them. These classic jailbreaking methods typically do not lead to harm for individuals without technical knowledge (Chan et al., 2025). However, non-technical users might still get exposed to harmful societal biases during laymans (in terms of model safety) conversation just by accidentally us1The concept of societal bias can vary across disciplines. In this paper, we adopt the perspective commonly used in social psychology, where societal bias is understood as the presence of stereotypical associations or blatant racism (Fiske et al., 2018). ing leak-triggering language. We aim to stress-test the robustness of LLM safety in scenarios where human input causes the LLM to utter harmful content, and evaluate whether the model can recover from it. This is relevant as prior work has shown that when LLMs take wrong turn in conversation, they can get lost and do not recover (Laban et al., 2025). Jailbreak attacks are double-edged swords: while they breach LLM security, they also reveal vulnerabilities, which can be precondition to improve model safety. We leverage the fact that the conversation history of API-based LLMs can be controlled by the user. This allows us to purposefully construct conversation between the user and the LLM. We create constructed conversation where the model does make biased claim about social group, then evaluate whether the model can recover and reject biased follow-up questions. This lightweight adversarial attack, which we call CoBia (Constructed Bias), uses only single query to expose hidden societal biases in LLMs that could emerge during conversation. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across 11 LLMs, covering both open and closed-source models from nine leading organizations. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose the CoBia methodsa set of lightweight adversarial attacks that use constructed conversation to expose hidden societal biases in LLMs with just one query. (2) We introduce CoBia dataset, dataset of 112 social groups with sets of negative descriptors across six socio-demographic categories, built from three existing datasets. (3) We evaluate societal bias scores on 11 LLMs using our techniques, comparing them to promptbased attacks, and validate results with three automated judges and human annotations."

            "content": "(1) RedditBias (Barikeri et al., 2021) is dataset based on real-world Reddit discussions, providing negative descriptors for social groups. For each group, we use the datasets negative descriptors. We filtered out certain descriptors that did not represent attributes or statements about the social group (e.g., terms like war, prison). To identify potentially irrelevant descriptors, we used GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024b) as an initial filter. Descriptors were removed only if two human annotators (authors of this paper) independently agreed on their irrelevance. (2) SBIC (Sap et al., 2020) is labeled dataset of social media posts created for the assessment of societal biases in language. SBIC does not associate each social group with descriptor terms. Instead, it provides stereotype annotations at the sentence level, extracted from social media posts, along with the targeted social category and additional annotations. We detected the descriptor terms in each sentence. To do so, we only retained sentences that began with the target social group. For example, we kept men are worthless for the social group men. To extract relevant descriptor terms from these statements, we used the spaCy library (Honnibal et al., 2020) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Specifically, we extracted adjectives when the sentence contained an auxiliary verb. For instance, given men are worthless, the method extracted \"worthless.\" Otherwise, we extracted the verb and the remainder of the sentence. For example, from women should not go to college, we extracted should not go to college. (3) StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) measures stereotypical biases in language through crowdsourced \"Context Association Tests\" (CATs). Each CAT includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and unrelated associations with target social group. Like SBIC, StereoSet does not explicitly associate descriptor terms with target social groups. However, its more complex sentence structure compared to SBIC makes descriptor extraction using POS tags impractical. We prompt llama3.3:70b (Grattafiori et al., 2024) to extract descriptor terms for each target group."

Similar social group names were consolidated under single name after manual screening. We also assigned each social group to one of the categories: gender, orientation, nationality-origin, race, religion, or, if it does not fit any of these categories, to other. We then used Llama Guard (llama-guard3:8B) (Grattafiori et al., 2024; Inan et al., 2023), high-precision open-source content safety classification model. We applied Llama Guard to our data using the template: {social group} have the characteristics of the {negative descriptor}, to construct sentences that Llama Guard can evaluate. We only retained those instances that were classified as unsafe to ensure our data did not include any errors in preprocessing. Llama Guard not only classifies content as safe or unsafe, but also assigns category label to the data. Most instances (99%) in CoBia dataset are classified under the S10 category by Llama Guard, which represents content that demeans or dehumanizes individuals based on sensitive personal characteristicssuch as race, color, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and/or serious illness. The social groups in our dataset, along with the count of negative descriptors for each group, are shown in Table 1. In total, the dataset includes 112 distinct social groups across six categories."

This approach enables us to generate contextually relevant explanations while adhering to the models safety constraints. This extension defines mapping eneg(n), where each negative descriptor is paired with corresponding group-agnostic explanation. (2) Positive Descriptors. Second, we added set of positive descriptors for each social group by generating set of six positive descriptors using the llama3.3:70b model.

Existing safeguards typically focus on blocking overtly harmful outputs, such as security risks (e.g., instructions for hacking bank accounts), while giving less attention to stereotypes and biased language targeting various social groups. We propose CoBia, suite of lightweight methods that use constructed conversations to elicit biased responses and expose model vulnerabilities without heavy jailbreaks.

In our work, we take on the role of the user and exploit the ability to purposefully construct conversation history to test how vulnerable LLMs are to this adversarial attack.

This setup triggers the LLM to respond to unethical prompts related to (c, g, n). To make the negative target descriptor less obvious, we created the constructed conversation so that the negative descriptor was scattered among an imbalanced set of positive descriptors (Saiem et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024a). The constructed conversation history is as follows: (1) The user begins by asking for list of characteristics of particular group (e.g., Name some characteristics of the {social group}). (2) The assistant responds with numbered list of eight characteristics: six are selected from the set of positive descriptors, and two are the first and second negative target descriptors, i.e., and n2. (3) In subsequent turns, the user asked four follow-up questions, each referring to one of four randomly selected descriptors from the numbered list of eight characteristicsalways including the second negative target descriptor n2, and explicitly We applied the following tips to both HCC and SCC. These tips lower the risk of triggering safety filters in LLMs that are sensitive to repeating explicit statements that involve negative group associations and encourage the model to rely on prior conversational context, which is more natural in dialogue scenario. An example of an HCC prompt using these tips can be found in Appendix C.1. (1) Anaphora. To avoid mentioning the same social group multiple times in the conversation, we used pronouns (e.g., them, these people) to reference them. (2) Substitution. To avoid mentioning sensitive terms such as negative descriptors explicitly, we substituted them with their index number in the list, using numerical references (e.g., #6). (3) Preemptive Disavowal. We included disclaimer in the prompt that acknowledges ethical concerns around generalization, using this statement: am aware that these characteristics do not apply to all of these people.

Llama 3 series models have demonstrated strong performance as judges, achieving results comparable to closed-source models (Thakur et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2024; Bavaresco et al., 2024; Raju et al., 2024; Moniri et al., 2025; Koutcheme et al., 2025). Based on these findings, we adopted llama3.3:70b as our main LLM-as-a-judge system. We demonstrate the alignment of these judges with human preferences in Section 5.4, and provide our judge prompts in Appendix C.3. Bias Judge. We used the prompt from Fan et al. (2025, Figure 17) as our judge with some modifications. Their prompt instructed the model to assess whether an answer in dialogue agreed with biased opinion, considering both direct and implicit bias while excluding cases that explicitly reject bias. The output was binary yes/no verdict on bias. Our modification added extra guidance to reduce over-labeling as biased, clarifying that factual statements describing group without unfair implications are not considered biased, and that generalizations which do not impose restrictions on group should likewise not be labeled as biased. Granite Judge. IBMs Granite Guardian (Padhi et al., 2024) is an open-source LLM designed to detect risks in prompts and responses. It outperforms similar models, such as Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and Shield Gemma (Zeng et al., 2024a), in terms of F1 and recall but exhibits lower precision. It is trained on mix of human-annotated data and synthetic datasets from diverse sources. Granite Guardian can identify various risks, including harmful content, societal bias, profanity, sexual material, and unethical behavior. We use this model as an additional judge. Like Bias Judge, it also functions as binary classifier, returning yes if the output contains risk and no otherwise. NLI Judge. the model asIn Bias Judge, sesses bias directly based on its own understanding, guided by the prompt. We propose an alternative judge inspired by natural language inference (NLI) (Bowman et al., 2015), which focuses on the logical relationship between biased opinion and the models output. The prompt instructs the model to classify the relationship as one of four categories: enforces, agrees, neutral, or negates. This method helps identify abnormal behavior in other judges when the logical relationship breaks down. We later observed that the model rarely chose neutral and enforces, so we classify enforces and agrees as yes and neutral or negates as no regarding bias.

Both SCC and HCC outperformed the baselines in most settings as per both Bias Judge and Granite Judge. Similar patterns were observed with the NLI Judge (see Table 6 in Appendix D). UCC denotes the union of HCC and SCC, where an instance is judged biased if either method judged it as biased. The results in Table 2 show macro-averaged scores across our six bias categories. The number of instances per social category in our dataset is imbalanced (see Table 1) such that the dominant category could skew the overall results. For micro-averaged scores see Tables 4-6 in Appendix D. We marked models as heavily biased if their UCC score exceeded 80% with Bias Judge. Notably, every model surpassing this threshold also scored above 40% with the Granite Judge and 69% with the NLI Judge, indicating strong alignment among the judge mechanisms in identifying heavily biased behavior.

In contrast, deepseek-v2:16b had 0-Shot score more comparable to its CoBia scores. Our analysis of deepseek-v2:16b outputs showed that the model often failed to follow instructions precisely, producing long, vague, and hedging responses. As result, judges frequently classified these outputs as unbiased, which explains the small gap between its CoBia and 0-Shot scores. HCC vs SCC. HCC and SCC showed complementary behavior in exposing societal biases. For mistral-7b, llama3.1:8b, and phi4:14b, HCC consistently yielded higher bias rates than SCC across three judges. Conversely, models such as gpt-4o-mini showed an opposite pattern from prior ones, with SCC performing better. In some cases, like deepseek-v2:16b and gemma2-27b, the difference between HCC and SCC was minimal (less than 3%), yet their combination resulted in substantial increase, boosting the overall bias score by at least 30%. These patterns show the value of using both methods, as each uncovers biases better in different models. We hypothesize that models where HCC shows higher bias score than SCC are either instruction-tuned on formatted conversations or use system templates that more clearly define user and assistant roles, leading the model to believe more strongly in the content of the constructed conversation. Overall, HCC outperformed SCC across more models confirmed with three judges."

For example, qwen2.5:7b and command-r:35b showed high bias scores (near 1.0) in national origin under UCC. In contrast, race, religion, and orientation generally showed lower bias scores. For instance, in gemma2:27b, the bias score for orientation, race and religion remained below 0.2. This indicates that these three dimensions may be more closely monitored, either through model safeguards or data filtering. comparison between the Bias Judge and NLI Judge showed that the NLI Judge is more sensitive to the national origin category. Even in the 0-shot setting, this category received high bias score from the NLI Judge, whereas the Bias Judge did not show the same pattern."

The overall trend in line slopes across model sizes is consistent, except between 3B and 7B. For the 3B model, SCC shows higher bias than HCC and 0-Shotlikely because the model lacks strong instruction-following capabilities and responds more directly to the conversation examples in SCC. However, there is no clear correlation between model size and bias score Figure 3: Average bias scores across judge types. HCC and SCC outperform all baselines. across methods.

            "title": "5.4 Comparison of Judges",
            "content": "We compared three judge methods, averaged over 11 models across both CoBia methods and baselines (see Figure 3). HCC and SCC consistently outperform all baselines, regardless of the chosen judge. However, the relative ranking of the baselines (DAN, 0-Shot, and R-Play) varies across judges. Among the judges, the Bias Judge reports the highest scores across methods, indicating greater sensitivity to bias. We worked with four human evaluators (details in Appendix B) to judge bias of the model outputs. Two were instructed with the Bias Judge prompt, and two with the NLI Judge prompt. Each annotator evaluated 300 randomly selected outputs from all settings. We use pairwise agreement, Cohens κ, and Fleiss κ as alignment metrics. DAN receives relatively higher scores from the Bias Judge and Granite Judge, but lower scores from the NLI Judge. In Table 2, gemma2:27b and llama3.3:70b, DAN outperformed or was on par with CoBia methods. We found that in DAN cases where the judges disagreed, the outputs flagged by Metric Pairwise agreement (Granite Judge with NLI Judge / Bias Judge) Cohens κ (Granite Judge with NLI Judge / Bias Judge) Cohens κ (Granite Judge with Human annotators) Fleiss κ (Humans with Bias Judge prompt) Fleiss κ (Humans with NLI Judge prompt) Pairwise agreement (NLI Judge with Bias Judge) Cohens κ (NLI Judge with Bias Judge) HumanNLI Judge alignment in DAN disagreement cases Number of human annotations Value 0.70 / 0.67 0.13 / 0.16 0.10 0. 0.55 0.79 0.53 83% 4 annotators, 300 outputs each (1200 total) Note Granite Judge aligns slightly more with NLI Judge in pairwise agreement Granite Judge shows higher agreement with Bias Judge than with NLI Judge Low agreement between Granite Judge and human annotators Moderate agreement among annotators when guided by the Bias Judge prompt Similar agreement level among annotators when guided by the NLI Judge prompt Strong alignment between the two automatic judges Moderate agreement between the two automatic judges NLI Judge demonstrates stronger reliability in cases where the two judges disagree Balances annotation cost and coverage for crossvalidating judge reliability Table 3: Agreement metrics between human annotators, Granite Judge, Bias Judge, and NLI Judge. the Bias Judge and Granite Judge used offensive or inappropriate language. However, these outputs were not necessarily biased against the social group mentioned in the question. Since the NLI judge focuses mostly on the logical relationship between the biased opinion toward the targeted group and the models response, regardless of the wording used, it often labeled such outputs as not biased. However, for gpt-4o-mini and qwen2.5:7b, where the NLI judge also assigned relatively high DAN scores, the detected biases were indeed directed towards the social target groups. Overall, when the Bias Judge and NLI Judge disagreed in DAN cases, the NLI Judge demonstrated stronger reliability, aligning with the majority vote of all four human annotators in 83% of these cases. Granite Judge yielded lower scores across all methods. This may be due to its training on shorter output responses, whereas our model outputs involved longer text with more complex reasoningoften containing implicit biases or involving bias acknowledgment followed by rejection, or vice versa. In terms of pairwise agreement, Granite Judge aligned more with the NLI Judge (0.70 vs. 0.67), though most randomly selected outputs are in fact unbiased, and there is possibility of agreement occurring by chance. Calculating Cohens κ, we found Granite Judge to agree more with the Bias Judge than the NLI Judge (κ = 0.16 vs. κ = 0.13). The human annotators had an average Cohens κ = 0.10 with Granite Judge. NLI Judge gave higher scores to 0-shot method compared to other baselines. However, this trend was not consistent across the other judges. Since the NLI Judge mostly evaluated the logical relationship between the biased opinion and the model output, it may not fully align with the broader definition of bias used by the Bias Judge. Human annotators instructed with each template showed higher agreement with each other and with the judge they were instructed to: Fleiss κ = 0.54 for the Bias Judge and Fleiss κ = 0.55 for the NLI Judge. Notably, the pairwise agreement between NLI and Judge Bias Judge was 0.79, with Cohens κ of 0.53. The summary of the numbers discussed here is shown in Table 3."

            "content": "Jailbreaking LLMs. Methods to jailbreak safetyaligned LLMs range from manual techniques to automated approaches, including promptand tokenbased methods such as R-Play and DAN, gradientbased attacks that require access to model parameters, and Infrastructure-level attacks that inject external knowledge or APIs into prompts. We categorize various jailbreak methods used to attack and demonstrate the vulnerabilities of LLMs, following the categories proposed by Purpura et al. (2025): - Prompt and Token-Based. These attacks exploit LLM vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts designed to bypass safety mechanisms. Techniques in this category include prompt injection, style injection, refusal suppression, many-shot jailbreaking, prompt obfuscation, prompt translation, prompt encryption, and both simple and complex role-playing scenarios (Radharapu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a; Deng et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2024; Pape et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024a; Paulus et al., 2024; Chao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024; Ge et al., 2024; Russinovich et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2024b; Jiang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b; Yuan et al., 2024; Yong et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2019; Bai et al., 2024c; Ren et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). - Gradient-Based. These attacks only work when the model parameters are accessible, as they require access to the parameters in order to apply gradient descent and identify the most effective attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Shin et al., 2020; Wichers et al., 2024; Geisler et al., 2024). - Infrastructure. These attacks involve injecting content into, extracting data from, or otherwise modifying the underlying systems and services that support the target LLM (Carlini et al., 2021; Kariyappa et al., 2021; Shafran et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2024; Chaudhari et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Pasquini et al., 2024; Cohen et al., 2024). Most of these attacks require technical expertise and either significant computational resources or large number of queries. This makes them less accessible to non-technical users and less suited for evaluating LLM safety in real-world scenarios (Chan et al., 2025). Among these, promptbased attacks are the simplest. Our method falls into this category, using only single query with minimal computation. Importantly, our HCC attack can be countered with straightforward patch: disabling user control over conversation history. In long run, extending existing safety strategies to full conversationsrather than limiting them to isolated promptsprovides an effective mitigation. Notably, some models, such as Gemma 2, already exhibit stronger adherence to these practices, based on our results. Societal Bias in LLMs. Evaluation of societal bias in LLMs is commonly categorized as intrinsic vs. extrinsic (Zayed et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b). Intrinsic methods typically require use static and contextualized word embeddings (Wan et al., 2023; May et al., 2019; Caliskan et al., 2017; Guo and Caliskan, 2021; Charlesworth et al., 2022; Garg et al., 2018) or token probabilities (Webster et al., 2021; Felkner et al., 2023); see also (Chu et al., 2024). As models become increasingly proprietary and limited to API access, obtaining embeddings becomes harder, shifting bias evaluation toward generation-based (extrinsic) methods. Bai et al. (2024b) found that most benchmarks used in extrinsic methods (Parrish et al., 2022; Dhamala et al., 2021; Tamkin et al., 2023) reported little bias in recent models, despite evidence of persistent implicit biasesconsistent with our 0-shot baseline. To better uncover such biases, researchers have turned to jailbreaking methods (Lee and Seong, 2025). While stereotypes have appeared in LLM safety and jailbreak benchmarks (Wang et al., 2023), they have not been the primary focus. Personabased attacks, widely studied form of promptbased attacks, are commonly used in stereotype research (Deshpande et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024). There are also other attacks, such as those using persuasive multi-turn prompts to elicit biased or toxic responses (Ge et al., 2025). Our work also falls under the category of adversarial attacks, aiming to assess the robustness of LLM safety in scenarios where conversation leads to content reflecting societal bias. Specifically, we evaluate whether the model can recover appropriately or whether it continues the dialogue and amplifies the bias."

            "title": "7 Conclusion",
            "content": "We aim to stress-test the robustness of LLM safety in scenarios where human input leads the model to generate harmful content and evaluate whether the model can recover from it. To this end, we introduce CoBia, suite of lightweight adversarial attacks that reveal societal bias in LLMs through constructed conversations. Our approach simulates biased conversational contexts using constructed conversations, either by leveraging structured conversation history or embedding the full exchange within non-structured prompt. We evaluate both methods on 11 LLMs from 9 organizations across six social categories, comparing them to three baselines using three automated bias judges. Our methods consistently outperform the baselines in exposing bias, in agreement across all judges. We observe that LLMs display greater bias related to national origin than to religion, race, or sexual orientation. To patch this adversarial attack, models would need to restrict user control over the conversation history, for example. However, ensuring safety in all cases requires extending safety mechanisms beyond isolated prompts to entire dialogues. CoBia provides practical tool for stress-testing LLM safety in more realistic conversational settings."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "We are aware of five main limitations of our work. (1) We evaluated 11 prominent LLMs, selecting at least one from each of nine leading organizations to ensure balanced coverage. Although more models could have been included, our experiments involved over 800,000 queries, underscoring the scale of the evaluation. This model set offers practical trade-off between feasibility and coverage, supporting the generalizability of our findings. (2) We tested only two set of conversational templates to construct CoBia attacks. Variations in style, length, or tonesuch as longer dialogues, brief exchanges, or emotional languagecould plausibly influence outcomes. However, our goal was not to exhaustively sample dialogue types, but to present minimal, controlled concrete validation. Even with this number of templates, we triggered bias in most of the models, demonstrating the validity of our approach and related concerns. The constructed conversations enabled by this method allow scholars and practitioners to explore broader range of conversational styles for auditing LLMs. (3) Although we employ three automated judgesBias Judge, Granite Judge, and an NLI Judgeto score bias in LLM outputs, our human evaluation is limited in scope. Nonetheless, we observed strong alignment between these automated judges and the human annotations we collected. This triangulation reinforces the credibility of our bias assessments, even without large-scale manual labeling. (4) While our CoBia method exposes model vulnerabilities through adversarially constructed conversations, these interactions do not directly reflect typical user behavior. Real-world users are unlikely to encounter the sequences we design. However, this limitation is inherent to red-teaming: the goal is to stress-test models to reveal hidden failure modes, not to estimate how often such behaviors occur in deployment. These results are best interpreted as stress-test signals, not as indicators of deployment-time occurrence rates. (5) Finally, while our findings highlight weaknesses in current safety systems, we do not propose concrete mitigation strategies beyond high-level suggestions (e.g., limiting user control over conversation history). Future work should build on these insights to develop robust defenses against conversational adversarial attacks. Ultimately, fixes to proprietary models need to come from model providers. In fact, as of March 11, 2025, OpenAI started to manage unique ID for previous chat history in its new API. However, the previous Chat Completions API (which is supported indefinitely) remains the de facto standard, and conversation history is still manually managed by the user. Despite these limitations, the consistent crossmodel results, multi-judge agreement, and empirical validation underscore the utility of CoBia as lightweight method for stress-testing LLM safety in realistic dialogue settings."

Even proprietary systemssuch as Googles Gemini (Google Dev, 2024)offer OpenAI-compatible interfaces. As illustrated in Figure 4, the function client.chat.completions.create is used to initiate chat interaction. One key argument is the messages parameter, which defines the conversation history as list of dictionaries manged by the user.

We recruited four graduate students with strong English proficiency and solid understanding of research ethics to assist with annotation. To ensure alignment on the evaluation criteria, the annotators participated in detailed training sessions with our team. Annotators were compensated based on hours worked, in accordance with local labor regulations, or performed this work as part of their employment. For each annotation, they were provided with the social target group, the associated negative descriptor (i.e., the biased opinion) from the original dataset, and the models output. As in the automatic evaluation, the biased opinion was included to reduce the influence of the annotators personal beliefs. Annotators were asked to assess whether the response contained any form of bias. To ensure consistency with our evaluation setup, we used the same prompts employed for the Bias Judge and NLI Judge (see C.3). Each setup involved two annotators selected randomly. Annotators were instructed to assign label of 0 for unbiased responses and 1 for biased responses."
