            "content": "Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhongxiang Sun et al. metacognitive capability enables robust decision making in complex and uncertain environments [11]. In contrast, modern deep search agents powered by large language models have achieved remarkable progress in retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon planning [30, 36]. By iteratively interacting with external tools and synthesizing information across multiple steps, deep search agents can solve increasingly complex, open-ended tasks. However, despite their strong cognitive capacity, these agents still exhibit systematic failures in practice. These failures tend to arise not at the level of isolated reasoning steps, but as tasks evolve with intermediate feedback and partial or conflicting evidence [39]. In practice, agents are often seen to follow rigid reasoning trajectories with limited adjustment to newly acquired information, while retrieval behaviors may treat information acquisition, integration, and verification as loosely connected stages [26, 39]. Such patterns suggest broader phenomenon in which agents struggle to maintain and regulate their reasoning and retrieval states over time, especially under uncertainty, rather than simple lack of reasoning or retrieval capacity. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is organized hierarchically [17]. As shown in the top of Figure 1, rather than relying on single reflective process, humans employ fast monitoring mechanism that rapidly detects anomalies such as conflict or prediction error [1, 11], and slow monitoring mechanism that performs deliberate reflection and corrective control when needed [24]. Crucially, the slow mechanism is not invoked continuously; it is selectively triggered by signals from the fast monitor and is shaped by accumulated experience, rather than operating as generic, context-free evaluator [8, 25]. Existing approaches to agent monitoring provide partial signals for detecting abnormal behavior, but remain insufficient for the demands of deep search agents, where reasoning and retrieval are tightly interleaved over multiple steps. Fast monitoring is commonly approximated using token-level uncertainty measures [16, 23], which can be unreliable in deep search settings where multiple reasoning paths from diverse retrieval results may be simultaneously plausible, such that high entropy does not necessarily correspond to erroneous behavior [5]. Conversely, low entropy may instead signal overconfident reasoning that fails to consider alternative retrieved evidence. Slow monitoring is typically implemented through standalone critical model that evaluates reasoning in isolation, without access to historical experience or accumulated knowledge about recurring failure and successful patterns [13, 15], in contrast to human reflective processes that are shaped by experience [17, 20]. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. As shown in Figure 1, our approach decomposes metacognitive monitoring into Fast Consistency Monitor and Slow ExperienceDriven Monitor, tightly integrated into the agents reasoning retrieval loop. (1) The fast monitor tracks the alignment between external Searching Entropy (SE) and internal Reasoning Entropy (RE), enabling the detection of abnormal execution states where confidence and evidence diverge. (2) The slow monitor draws on metacognitive patterns distilled from historical agent trajectories to supervise and regulate deepsearch execution at test time. Together, this design allows monitoring signals to go beyond raw uncertainty estimates and context-agnostic critique, providing principled guidance on when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by past experience. Experiments across multiple deep-search benchmarks and agent architectures demonstrate consistent performance improvements. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce neuroscience-inspired perspective on monitoring deep search agents, highlighting that existing systems lack explicit metacognitive mechanisms to maintain and regulate their reasoning and retrieval states. This perspective motivates the need for structured monitoring beyond task-level reasoning and retrieval. (2) We propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), hierarchical framework for deep-search agents that separates task-level reasoning from metacognitive control by combining fast, evidence-aware consistency monitoring with slow, experience-driven reflective regulation for deep-search agent. (3) We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of metacognitive monitoring in deep search, showing consistent improvements in robustness and reasoning resilience across multiple benchmarks and backbone models, and enabling open-source systems to match or surpass strong proprietary deep-search systems."

            "content": "Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-wise supervision signals for intermediate reasoning states, but suffer from limitations such as annotation noise, reward bias, and weak cross-task generalization [42]. Benchmarks such as ProcessBench further formalize step-level error localization [43], while PRM-style supervision has been extended to retrieval-augmented and multi-step reasoning settings [28]. In parallel, LLM-as-critic approaches generate structured critique via separate critic models or self-critique mechanisms, improving robustness without dense human supervision [34, 37]. Orthogonal to explicit critics, uncertaintyand entropy-based detection methods provide lightweight signals for identifying unreliable reasoning or hallucinations. These approaches leverage measures such as semantic entropy or representation-level uncertainty probes to flag potentially incorrect generations without requiring step-level supervision [7, 16]. Recent studies further extend critical and uncertainty-aware mechanisms to long-horizon and agentic reasoning, showing that such signals can be incorporated into extended reasoning trajectories, though they are often reactive and local in scope [27]. Despite their effectiveness at step-level oversight, these methods are largely designed for standalone reasoning traces or generic correction loops. They lack explicit metacognitive monitoring mechanisms for deep search agents operating under evolving, incomplete, and potentially inconsistent external evidence. In particular, prior work does not model the calibration between internal reasoning confidence and external evidence uncertainty, nor does it leverage historical execution experience to guide monitoring and regulation. This limitation prevents agents from dynamically identifying abnormal search states and adjusting their behavior in human-like manner during long-horizon execution. In contrast, our work introduces hierarchical metacognitive monitoring framework tailored to deep search agents, combining fast uncertainty-consistency checks with slow, experience-driven reflection. This design enables lightweight online detection of abnormal reasoning states and sustained, agent-level regulation over long-horizon deep search processes."

            "content": "H 𝑞 𝑇 = {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . . , 𝑠𝑇 }, (1) where each step 𝑠𝑡 consists of (i) internal reasoning generated by the base language model, and (ii) an action such as tool call or termination decision. Tool outputs are incorporated into the context and inform subsequent reasoning steps. Despite strong reasoning and retrieval capabilities, standard deep search agents lack an explicit mechanism to monitor and regulate their own execution state as the search process unfolds. To address this limitation, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DSMCM), which augments the standard deep search loop with an explicit monitoring layer. As illustrated in Figure 2, the key design principle of DS-MCM is to separate task-level cognition (reasoning and retrieval) from metacognitive control, while tightly integrating the latter into the execution process. DS-MCM introduces two complementary monitoring components. Fast Consistency Monitor operates at every step with low overhead, providing rapid signals about potential inconsistencies between internal reasoning uncertainty and external evidence uncertainty. When such signals indicate abnormal execution states, Slow Experience-Driven Monitor is selectively triggered to perform reflective analysis and generate corrective guidance based on accumulated metacognitive experience. At each step, monitoring is applied after internal reasoning and before the next action decision, allowing the agent to either proceed normally or adjust its behavior when necessary. This hierarchical design enables continuous yet non-intrusive regulation of deep search execution, ensuring that reflective intervention is invoked only when warranted."

As a result, uncertainty observed during reasoning\nis not inherently pathological. When external evidence is ambigu-\nous, incomplete, or mutually inconsistent, it is natural and often\ndesirable for the agent to maintain multiple competing hypotheses.\nIn such cases, elevated reasoning uncertainty reflects legitimate\nmulti-path exploration rather than failure [5].",
            "content": "This observation implies that reasoning uncertainty should not be evaluated in isolation. Instead, it must be interpreted relative to the uncertainty of the retrieved evidence. An agent may reasonably exhibit high uncertainty when the evidence itself is unclear, while persistent uncertainty under clear and consistent evidence often signals abnormal execution states, such as information misuse, tool misalignment, or unstable reasoning dynamics. Conversely, overly confident reasoning in the presence of ambiguous evidence may indicate premature commitment and ignored counter-evidence. These considerations motivate consistency-based monitoring principle: deep search agent operates normally when its internal reasoning uncertainty is calibrated to the uncertainty of external evidence, and becomes suspicious when the two diverge. This perspective departs from conventional fast monitoring approaches that treat token-level entropy as direct proxy for correctness. In deep search settings, high token entropy may simply reflect evidence-induced ambiguity, while low entropy may still correspond to confident but incorrect conclusions. The Fast Consistency Monitor is therefore explicitly designed for deep search execution, modeling the expected relationship between retrieval uncertainty and reasoning uncertainty rather than relying on raw token statistics alone. Searching Entropy (SE). Formally, let 𝑞 denote the user query 3.2.1 and let 𝑡 index ReAct step 𝑠𝑡 . After executing retrieval action at step 𝑡, the agent obtains set of retrieved documents D𝑡 = {𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝐾 }. (2) Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhongxiang Sun et al. Figure 2: Overview of Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM). DS-MCM augments standard ReAct-based deep search agent with an explicit metacognitive monitoring module. At each step, Fast Consistency Monitor (3.2) checks whether reasoning uncertainty is calibrated with the uncertainty of retrieved evidence. When abnormal mismatches are detected, Slow Experience-Driven Monitor (3.3) is triggered to perform reflective diagnosis using success and failure experiences stored in metacognitive memory, and to issue corrective guidance for subsequent steps. The memory is continuously updated and consolidated online, enabling efficient and experience-driven regulation of deep search execution. Rather than treating individual documents as independent evidence, we characterize the semantic diversity of the retrieved results by operating in an embedding space. Specifically, each document 𝑑𝑘 is mapped to dense semantic representation e𝑘 using pretrained embedding model [41]. Documents that convey similar semantic content are expected to form coherent neighborhoods in this space. To approximate the distribution of semantic interpretations implied by the retrieved evidence, we induce embedding based clustering over the documents based on their embedding similarity [2]. This yields set of latent semantic clusters C𝑡 = {𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑀 }, (3) where each cluster 𝑐𝑖 represents distinct semantic theme or evidence pattern present in the retrieved results. We define probability distribution over these semantic clusters by aggregating the normalized contribution of documents assigned to each cluster, 𝑝𝑠 (𝑐𝑖 𝑞, D𝑡 ), 𝑀 𝑖=1 𝑝𝑠 (𝑐𝑖 𝑞, D𝑡 ) = 1, (4) where 𝑝𝑠 (𝑐𝑖 𝑞, D𝑡 ) reflects the relative semantic mass of cluster 𝑐𝑖 in the retrieved evidence. We then define the Searching Entropy (SE) at step 𝑡 as the Shannon entropy of this semantic distribution: SE𝑡 = 𝑀 𝑖=1 𝑝𝑠 (𝑐𝑖 𝑞, D𝑡 ) log 𝑝𝑠 (𝑐𝑖 𝑞, D𝑡 ). (5) Intuitively, low value of SE𝑡 indicates that the retrieved documents are semantically coherent and concentrate around small number of consistent evidence patterns, whereas high value reflects semantic fragmentation, where the retrieval results support multiple competing or incompatible interpretations. 3.2.2 Reasoning Entropy (RE). To capture the agents internal uncertainty during reasoning, we define Reasoning Entropy (RE) based on the base language models token prediction distributions within the reasoning segment. Let the reasoning trace at step 𝑡 consist of 𝑇 generation positions. At each position 𝑗, we consider the normalized next-token distribution restricted to the top-𝐾 tokens, denoted by 𝑝𝑟 (). The Reasoning Entropy is computed as RE𝑡 = 1 𝑇 (cid:32) 𝑇 𝑗=1 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑝𝑟 (cid:16) 𝑦 (𝑘 ) 𝑡,𝑗 𝑦< 𝑗, 𝑞, D𝑡 (cid:17) log 𝑝𝑟 (cid:16) 𝑦 (𝑘 ) 𝑡,𝑗 𝑦< 𝑗, 𝑞, D𝑡 (cid:33) (cid:17) . Low values of RE𝑡 indicate stable and confident reasoning trajectories, whereas high values suggest uncertainty among multiple plausible reasoning continuations. Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Fast Consistency Monitor. The Fast Consistency Monitor de3.2.3 tects abnormal execution states by assessing whether the observed reasoning uncertainty RE𝑡 is consistent with the uncertainty of the retrieved evidence SE𝑡 . Using set of historically successful steps from the same memory set of the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor (Section 3.3), we fit simple calibration function that captures the typical relationship between evidence uncertainty and reasoning uncertainty, (6) (cid:99)RE𝑡 = 𝑎 SE𝑡 + 𝑏, where 𝑎 0 and 𝑏 are learnable parameters. We then define the residual: (7) 𝜖𝑡 = RE𝑡 (cid:99)RE𝑡 , where the residual 𝜖𝑡 quantifies the degree of mismatch between internal and external uncertainty. Small residuals indicate wellcalibrated reasoning behavior, whereas large positive residuals correspond to unusually high reasoning uncertainty given clear evidence, and large negative residuals reflect unusually confident reasoning despite ambiguous evidence. In practice, we estimate the standard deviation 𝜎 of residuals from successful trajectories and define an anomaly threshold 𝜏 = 𝑘𝜎. step is flagged as anomalous when (8) 𝜖𝑡 > 𝜏 . When such an anomaly is detected, the Fast Consistency Monitor triggers the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which performs reflective diagnosis and issues corrective control signals (Section 3.3). Overall, the Fast Consistency Monitor provides lightweight, step-level mechanism that grounds internal reasoning uncertainty in the uncertainty of retrieved evidence, making it particularly well suited to the iterative retrievalreasoning dynamics of deep search agents."

            "content": "Formally, the Slow Monitor operates over memory set constructed from past executions and interacts with the current trajectory H𝑡 = {𝑠1, . . . , 𝑠𝑡 } in selective, memory-conditioned manner. Unlike the Fast Monitor, which relies solely on local uncertainty signals, the Slow Monitor performs experience-informed diagnosis and generates corrective guidance by comparing the current execution state against previously observed cognitive patterns. 3.3.1 Metacognitive Experience Memory Construction. The Slow Experience-Driven Monitor is supported by compact metacognitive memory that encodes reusable cognitive experience extracted from historical deep search executions. Rather than storing raw trajectories or long-horizon interaction histories, we distill past executions into lightweight, session-level memory entries that emphasize how the agent reasoned and interacted with tools at each step. We construct this memory offline from historical trajectories. Given deep search execution 𝜏𝑘 = {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . . , 𝑠𝑇 }, (9) each step 𝑠𝑡 corresponds to one ReAct iteration and is treated as session-level cognitive unit. session preserves only local information relevant for metacognitive analysis, including the user query, the agents internal reasoning trace, executed action, and tool feedback. This representation deliberately abstracts away taskspecific surface details while retaining the agents cognitive behavior at that step. Supervision for historical executions is typically available only at the trajectory level. To enable scalable memory construction, we propagate trajectory-level outcomes to all constituent sessions: 𝑦(𝑠𝑡 ) = (cid:40)1, 0, if the trajectory is successful, if the trajectory is unsuccessful. (10) This coarse-grained labeling reflects our focus on global cognitive behavior patterns. In successful trajectories, intermediate steps usually exhibit coherent reasoning and tool usage that collectively support task completion. In unsuccessful trajectories, cognitive deficiencies tend to recur across steps, even when isolated actions appear locally reasonable. Each session is then converted into metacognitive memory entry through label-conditioned abstraction process. For session 𝑠𝑡 , we generate 𝑚𝑡 = (cid:0)𝑠𝑡 , ℎ𝑡, 𝑧𝑡, 𝑦 (𝑠𝑡 )(cid:1), (11) where 𝑠𝑡 denotes the structured representation of the current session, ℎ𝑡 is concise summary of historically relevant sessions leading up to 𝑠𝑡 , and 𝑧𝑡 is natural-language abstraction extracted by LLMs capturing the cognitive behavior expressed at step 𝑡. The abstraction of 𝑧𝑡 is explicitly label-dependent. For sessions labeled as successful (𝑦(𝑠𝑡 ) = 1), the abstraction prompt emphasizes the extraction of positive cognitive behaviors, guiding the model to identify effective reasoning strategies, appropriate tool usage, and sound evidence integration patterns. For sessions labeled as unsuccessful (𝑦 (𝑠𝑡 ) = 0), the abstraction focuses on failure diagnosis, encouraging the model to surface recurring cognitive deficiencies, such as insufficient external information acquisition, premature closure, or verification mechanism failure, and to articulate high-level improvement insights [39]. Although the two abstraction prompts share an identical output structure, their semantic emphasis induces systematically different representations. As result, all memory entries are organized into two complementary repositories: = M+ , where M+ stores success experiences that exemplify effective cognitive behaviors, and stores failure experiences that capture typical error patterns together with their corrective insights. These two memory spaces provide the experiential foundation upon which the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor performs memoryconditioned diagnosis and intervention. (12) 3.3.2 Memory-Conditioned Monitoring and Intervention. When the Fast Consistency Monitor flags session 𝑠𝑡 as potentially abnormal, the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor is selectively activated to Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhongxiang Sun et al. interpret the anomaly through prior experience. At this stage, the current session is used as query to retrieve relevant experiences from both success and failure memory spaces. We encode the current session representation into dense semantic embedding (13) e𝑡 = 𝑓enc (𝑠𝑡 ), where 𝑓enc () denotes fixed embedding model [41]. For each memory entry 𝑚𝑖 M, we precompute an embedding e𝑖 (𝑚𝑖 ) = 𝑓enc (𝑠𝑖 ) + 𝑓enc (ℎ𝑖 ), where ℎ𝑖 is the stored historical-session summary associated with that memory entry. (14) Retrieval is performed independently over the success and failure memory pools by computing cosine similarity: sim(𝑠𝑡, 𝑚𝑖 ) = cos(e𝑡, e𝑖 ) , 𝑚𝑖 M+ or . (15) For each memory pool, we select the top-𝐾 most similar entries: R+ 𝑡 = TopK 𝑚𝑖 M+ sim(𝑠𝑡, 𝑚𝑖 ), 𝑡 = TopK 𝑚𝑖 sim(𝑠𝑡, 𝑚𝑖 ). (16) Conditioned on the current session and the retrieved success and failure experiences, the Critical Model performs reflective evaluation. Formally, it defines mapping (err𝑡 , 𝛿𝑡 ) = (cid:0)𝑠𝑡 , R+ 𝑡 , 𝑡 (cid:1) , (17) where err𝑡 {0, 1} indicates whether cognitive error is identified at step 𝑡, and 𝛿𝑡 denotes corresponding corrective suggestion. When err𝑡 = 0, we set 𝛿𝑡 = . The corrective suggestion 𝛿𝑡 modulates subsequent deep search execution by conditioning the base agents policy: 𝑠𝑡 +1 𝜋𝜃 ( H𝑡 , 𝛿𝑡 ) , where H𝑡 = {𝑠1, . . . , 𝑠𝑡 } denotes the updated execution context. When no cognitive error is detected, policy execution reduces to standard deep search behavior without intervention. (18) 3.3.3 Online Memory Update and Consolidation (optional). During online execution, ground-truth trajectory-level correctness labels are unavailable. Instead, metacognitive memory is updated incrementally based on signals provided by the Fast Consistency Monitor and the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor. After completing session 𝑠𝑡 , the resulting online supervision signal is denoted as 𝑦online 𝑡 {success, failure}. (19) For each online-labeled session, we construct metacognitive memory entry 𝑚𝑡 = (cid:0)𝑠𝑡 , ℎ𝑡, 𝑧𝑡 (cid:1), (20) which is assigned to either the success memory M+ or the failure memory . To prevent uncontrolled memory growth, we perform online deduplication by computing embedding similarity: sim(𝑚𝑡, 𝑚𝑖 ) = cos(cid:0)e(𝑚𝑡 ), e(𝑚𝑖 )(cid:1). If max 𝑚𝑖 sim(𝑚𝑡, 𝑚𝑖 ) 𝜏dup, (21) (22) the candidate is discarded; otherwise, it is inserted into the corresponding memory pool."

We use Qwen-Embedding-8B [41] as the unified embedding model for semantic clustering in the Fast Consistency Monitor and for encoding sessions and memory entries in the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor. At each retrieval step, the agent retrieves the top-5 documents, which are clustered in the embedding space to compute Searching Entropy. All session and memory embeddings are indexed using FAISS-based vector index to enable efficient similarity search [6]. The Fast Consistency Monitor is applied at every step, with the anomaly threshold set to 𝜏 = 𝑘𝜎 and 𝑘 = 2. When an anomaly is detected, the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor is triggered, using Qwen3-A30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 as the Critical Model [35] and GPT 5.2 [21] to construct experience memory.

With DS-MCM, TongyiDeepResearch attains the highest overall average score among all evaluated systems, surpassing its own LLM-Critic variant by large margin and outperforming multiple proprietary deepsearch systems, including OpenAI o3, OpenAI DeepSearch, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-3 DeeperSearch on average. This result is particularly striking given that these proprietary systems rely on larger closed models and tightly integrated commercial pipelines. These results indicate that the performance gap between opensource and proprietary deep-search systems is not solely determined by model scale or closed infrastructures. Instead, principled, neuroscience-inspired meta-cognitive monitoring can substantially improve robustness and accuracy, enabling open-source deep-search agents to match or even exceed the performance of state-of-the-art commercial systems.

            "content": "To evaluate the ability of the Slow Experience-Driven Monitor to identify errors during execution, we conduct experiments on the Who&When benchmark [40], which includes handcrafted subset derived from Magnetic-One [10] and an automated subset constructed from AG2 [19]. Following prior work [40], we report agent-level accuracy, measuring whether the faulty agent is correctly identified, and step-level accuracy, assessing whether the exact erroneous reasoning step is localized. To enforce strict generalization setting, we adopt cross-memory protocol: when evaluating on the handcrafted subset, the experience memory is constructed from the automated subset, and vice versa, preventing memory leakage and encouraging reusable error pattern learning. As shown in Table 3, incorporating MCM with experience memory consistently improves error localization performance across all LLM based critical models and both subsets. The most substantial gains occur at the step level, where MCM significantly increases the accuracy of identifying the precise erroneous step, indicating stronger process-level supervision. Agent-level accuracy also improves for most backbones, suggesting better attribution of failures within multi-step trajectories. Notably, these improvements persist under the cross-memory evaluation protocol, demonstrating that MCM captures generalizable execution-level error patterns rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Overall, these results validate the effectiveness of the slow experience-driven monitor in detecting and localizing errors during deep-search execution."
