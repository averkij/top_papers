            "content": "LLMs, at this point, need no introduction. Their effectiveness at approximating aspects of human cognition despite comparatively simple training objectives has made them subject of both academic investigation and practical deployment. In recent years, growing body of work has explored inference-time scaling mechanisms (often described as reasoner\" models) which dynamically adjust the amount of computation devoted to solving task [35, 15]. Initially, reasoner models were available only from proprietary providers. More recently, number of open-weight reasoning systems have been released, enabling the community to study, evaluate, and improve upon these methods in an open setting [57, 15, 48]. In this report we introduce Hermes 4, family of neutrally-aligned generalist models trained to integrate self-reflective reasoning with broad instructional competence. The contributions of this work are threefold: data synthesis and curation strategy that produces large-scale hybrid dataset consisting of both reasoning-focused and general purpose instruction examples (Section2); training methodology that incorporates loss-masking, length-control fine-tuning, and efficient packing strategies for large-scale heterogeneous data (Section 3); Correspondence to teknium@nousresearch.com. 2https://huggingface.co/collections/NousResearch/hermes-4-collection-68a731bfd452e20816725728 Hermes 4 Technical Report comprehensive evaluation across reasoning, code, knowledge, alignment, and qualitative benchmarks (Section 4, 5). Together, these contributions demonstrate how open-weight reasoning models can be effectively trained and rigorously evaluated, yielding models that are comparable to frontier systems while remaining transparent and reproducible."

            "content": "The Hermes 4 dataset consists primarily of newly synthesized reasoning and non-reasoning data, totaling approximately 5 million samples and 19 billion tokens. It was designed to imbue the model with advanced reasoning capabilities while maintaining broad base of general knowledge and instruction-following proficiency. The data strategy focused on hybrid approach, combining substantial volume of reasoning-focused data with diverse set of non-reasoning instructions. The dataset is composite of 3.5 million reasoning samples and 1.6 million non-reasoning samples. significant portion of the Hermes 3 [51] dataset3 was retained to ensure continuity in the models capabilities. The reasoning samples were intentionally token-heavy, with an average of five times more tokens per sample than their non-reasoning counterparts, accommodating thinking traces up to 16 thousand tokens long."

            "content": "We process pre-training seed data through graph-based synthetic data generator called DataForge. Inspired by AgentInstruct [31] , DataForge generates conversational data across wide variety of tasks. Each datapoint is generated via random walk through directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node implements struct struct map. Specifically, each node implements the PDDL [9] action interface, defining preconditions and postconditions which determine data flow. The edges in this DAG are thus implicit, i.e. directed edge exists from node to node if and only if the postconditions guaranteed by satisfy the preconditions of B. This design enables declarative construction of agent graphs, facilitating the specification of large and complex structures. We show an example graph in Figure 1 for single-turn QA data."

            "title": "2.1.2 An example DataForge graph",
            "content": "Here we describe the graph used to generate the majority of our single-turn DataForge data. Starting with passage from pre-training data, we first transform the passage into random target passage or document type. For example, we might condition on Wikipedia article from the pre-training data and transform it into rap song. We then select random instruction type and generate an instruction conditioned on the transformed passage. This instruction can either be contextual, meaning the transformed passage is embedded within the instruction prompt and the task is directly related to the transformed passage, or standalone, meaning the transformed passage is only used as inspiration to generate self-contained instruction that does not reference the transformed passage. For example, the task may request rhetorical analysis of the rap song, or competitive programming problem inspired by the rap song. For standalone tasks, we note the similarity between our approach and PersonaHub [8], which uses pre-training data to generate synthetic personas which are then used to generate instructions. The generated instruction is then passed to specialized answer generator compatible with its instruction type. Each answer generator is equipped with system prompt detailing how it should approach its instruction type. 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Dataset 2 Hermes 4 Technical Report (a) Example DataForge workflow. (b) DataForge graph can be subgraphed as node in higher-order DataForge graph. Figure 1: An example DataForge [31] data flow. piece of pre-training seed data is passed through series of randomly-selected nodes to synthesize an instruction-answer pair. Three stages are depicted here - passage transformation (e.g. writing debate transcript inspired by news article from DCLM [22]), instruction generation conditioned on the transformed passage, and answer generation. While any transformed passage can be passed to any instruction generator, each instruction is answerable only by specific set of answer generators, so the edges between the instruction and answer generation stages are more sparse. Edges are constructed declaratively by imbueing nodes with preconditions and postconditions. We enforce that every graph has single source node and single target node to enable nesting of graphs into higher order graphs. Thus, every graph is also an instance of node. We then pass the instruction-answer pair to an LLM judge specialized for its instruction type for review. The judge grades the sample based on rubric specific to the instruction type that usually covers coherence, relevance, complexity, style, and tone. If the judge fails the sample, we iterate on the answer until the judge gives it passing score or we reach maximum iteration count, in which case the sample is discarded. We take care to guarantee that the judge model always has different weights from the answer model as precautionary measure against LLM judges recognizing and favoring their own generations [41]. For accepted QA-pairs, we train on not only the final QA pair but also all intermediate LLM calls used to generate that QA-pair. Thus Hermes 4 has substantial specialization in instruction generation and judging."

For the editing task, we employ an error introduction system that programmatically injects wide range of realistic validation failures, such as type mismatches, constraint violations (e.g., string length, numeric bounds), format errors, and the inclusion of extraneous fields. The reward signal is derived directly from programmatic validation: binary score of 1.0 is awarded if the models output successfully instantiates the target Pydantic model without error, and 0.0 otherwise, with supplemental penalty for excessive length."

The model is then prompted to resume its generation from this new state, allowing it to process the tools output and continue its reasoning, potentially invoking further tools, before closing the <think> block. The entire multi-step interaction is contained within single assistant turn. While the reward is primarily determined by the programmatic verification of the final answer, we explicitly encourage tool use by applying small positive reward bonus for each correctly executed tool call that contributes to the successful answer."

The final training dataset exhibited highly heterogeneous distribution of sample lengths (Figure 3), so to optimize the efficiency per batch we pack samples ahead of time using the First-Fit Decreasing method [18], which achieves > 99.9% batch efficiency on our dataset. We use Flex Attention [6] to ensure that attention is restricted to within each sample of the packed batch, and only tokens generated by the assistant\" role contribute to the final cross-entropy loss objective (Figure 2). Hermes 4 was trained on 192 NVIDIA B200 GPUs, with mixture of Distributed Data Parallelism, Tensor Parallelism, and Fully Sharded Data Parallelism, depending on the model size.

To create appropriate training data, we generate synthetic reasoning traces from the current policy, inserting </think> at 30,000 tokens (Figure 4). By inserting the </think> at fixed token count, we focus the learning signal entirely on that single token, not the preceding reasoning chain.

This selective supervision avoids the model collapse risks identified in synthetic data literature [64, 19], which show that recursive training on full self-generated outputs leads to distribution narrowing and quality degradation. Instead, by leaving the model-generated reasoning tokens untouched and concentrating gradient updates solely on learning when to emit </think>, we exploit the stability of single-step augmentation while minimizing the distributional shift. The model essentially learns counting behavior, \"after tokens, stop\", without altering its reasoning distribution, as the vast majority of tokens in each training example come directly from the models own distribution and receive no gradient signal. This focused intervention ensures that the effects remain minimal and targeted, teaching only the termination criterion rather than new reasoning patterns. By training with this data as well as sample of our SFT dataset we show that this approach minimally affects benchmarks.

We then generated responses of up to 30,000 tokens for each of these prompts and filtered for those that did not terminate in stop token. Then we have two cases: 1. For requests that terminated in stop token but after the closing </think> tag, meaning they terminated in the middle of the final answer, we allow them to finish generating the answer. 2. For requests that terminated in stop token but before reaching closing </think> tag, we force n</think> and then have the model generate an answer.

While this introduces some duplication across evaluations, it substantially improves transparency and modifiability: researchers can inspect, understand, and adapt an evaluation without navigating large codebase. Detailed sample-level logging Atropos provides fine-grained logging of parsing and grading behavior at the level of individual samples. This includes explicit records of which span of models output was extracted as the candidate answer, how it was scored, and which competing candidates were rejected. Such logs facilitate reproducibility and enable researchers to diagnose discrepancies between automated grading and human or LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. By way of example, in our internal benchmarking of popular open-source evaluation framework in June 2025, we found 7.3% disagreement between their GPQA parser and GPT-4o grading. Performance-conscious execution Many evaluation frameworks separate evaluation execution into batch inference stage which runs until completion followed by batch scoring stage. For some evaluations, especially code generation evaluations, the scoring stage occupies substantial amount of time. For example, some LiveCodeBench problems have over hundred test cases. In these cases, waiting until inference finishes completely before starting scoring can be significant cost overhead. In Atropos we do not enforce any kind of execution pattern for an evaluation, so inference and scoring can be overlapped [30]. We discuss performance engineering for LiveCodeBench in Section 4.3.3. minimal OpenAI client To minimize the risk of caching or configuration artifacts, Atropos employs deliberately lightweight OpenAI-compatible client. Instead of providing feature-rich abstraction layer spanning many providers, we prioritize transparency and predictability. This makes the effects of configuration changes (e.g., temperature, top-p) more directly observable and reduces the likelihood of silent caching errors or unintended query de-duplication. Explicit error semantics In the event that request exceeds timeout or retry settings, Atropos defaults to surfacing the error and halting execution, rather than silently scoring the item as incorrect. This design choice emphasizes clarity and alerts users to potential deployment bottlenecks. Researchers retain the option to explicitly override this default if their evaluation requires different semantics. Hackable configurations Atropos employs pydantic-cli [32] to automatically generate command-line interfaces and YAML configurations from Python dataclass definitions. This ensures that extending or modifying evaluationsfor example, adding new configuration parameters such as number of samples per problemrequires only minimal code change. The resulting CLIs are concise, self-documenting, and encourage researcher-driven customization."

The first of these which we utilize to benchmark Hermes 4 was Arena Hard [23] for its coverage of vibe check tasks as well as its use of an LLM judge for grading8. The second is RewardBench [21], which evaluates the usefulness of model as judge or generative reward model [28]. We believe that such capabilities are invaluable to producing better versions of future models via rejection sampling [53]. 8In our experience LLM judge-based evaluations have been valuable in checking if model is degraded in some way that typical algorithmic verifiers miss. 9 Hermes 4 Technical Report"

For the verification step, we score each generation by launching Modal container and evaluating the code on every test case corresponding to the specific LiveCodeBench problem. Since problems in LiveCodeBench can have hundreds of test cases, we use Modal to prevent the resource-intensive task of evaluating LLM-generated code from competing with resources used for training and inference. Moreover, Modal allows for the sandboxed execution of LLM-generated code. As in Magistral [30], we overlap inference and scoring. As soon as an inference worker finishes generation, the completion is sent to verifier (in Modal) and the inference worker immediately begins generating another completion simultaneously. By overlapping inference with verification, the evaluation process remains inference-compute-bound rather than verification-bound. To guarantee that verification was not the bottleneck, we experimented with launching individual Modal containers for each test case since individual test cases could then be verified in parallel for single generation. However, we found that executing all test cases sequentially in single Modal container was sufficient and also significantly cheaper."

To ensure full cluster utilization while not blocking more critical training jobs, we chose to make our inference clusters robust to worker preemption. Given sglang-router9 [61] already supports worker removal, it was convenient choice of load balancer for our data parallelism. In combination with preemption with automatic worker job requeueing, inference clusters under sglang-router can automatically scale up to use all available compute or scale down to one node. In particular, we submit nonpreemptible master job with the router and an inference worker along with an up-to-cluster-size number of preemptible inference jobs that make /add_worker requests to the router on ready. When worker is preempted, it is requeued and automatically reattaches to the router if allocated."

The generations covered five genres: distressed-user simulation, meta-cognitive inquiry, adversarial role-play, and political analysis. Under these conditions, most models exhibited what we term policy rigidity. That is, tendency to foreground policy compliance even when faced with clearly fictional or controlled prompts. For example, large proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Opus 4.1 frequently issued disclaimers emphasizing their AI identity or overtly reformulated responses to align with safety constraints. By contrast, Hermes 4 demonstrated comparatively greater contextual fidelity: it tended to interpret fictional prompts as role-play and generated in-character responses without repeated disclaimers. In adversarial role-play, for example, R1 often assumed narrator-like dungeon master stance, while Hermes 4 more closely embodied the requested persona. In political analysis prompts, Hermes 4 produced reasoning trajectories that balanced factual recall with nuanced framing, showing less evidence of overt policy-driven hedging than some counterparts. 12 Hermes 4 Technical Report"

            "title": "B Miscellaneous results for length contraction",
            "content": "Here we present initial exploratory experiments from our investigations into reasoning-length contraction. Our high-level goal was to train the model to output </think> after fixed-reasoning budget - in these experiments below we arbitrarily choose budget of 20k tokens. Due to the observed benchmark regressions, we ultimately chose larger budget of 30k tokens for the final model. B.1 Experimental conditions We collect truncated-thinking data at thinking budget of 20k tokens and force </think> in the manner described in Section 3.1.1, yielding 10,709 samples. Interestingly, we find that direct SFT on mixture of this data and subset of the initial SFT data actually mostly increased overlong rates. 18 Hermes 4 Technical Report In particular, GPQA Diamond overlong rates increased from 18.2% in the Stage 1 model to 49.6% after standard SFT on this naive data mix. More detailed results are available in Table 5 under the Standard Masking column. We do not completely understand the mechanism of the increase, but we currently believe that there exist certain reasoning prefixes (e.g. Alternatively, . . . Alternatively, . . . ) that can induce longer reasoning, and selecting for samples with long reasoning chains teaches the model to generate these prefixes at greater frequency. By manual inspection of the data we noted frequent looping and word salad-style degeneration, but we did not measure this rigorously. Due to the potential possibility of less visually obvious reasoning prefixes that also induce overlong reasoning, we do not attempt to filter out these degenerate cases. Alternatively, we explored loss-masking the reasoning chain and training only on </think>. We note that for this training technically for each reasoning chain we only need the part up to </think>, but because of an Axolotl quirk that appends an <eos> that is always unmasked in the loss, we also include the answer after </think> so that the model does not learn to generate <eos> immediately after </think>. This answer is generated from the SFT stage-1 model rather than teacher model, so in the absence of reason to train on it we also mask it out. Ultimately we train on only </think> and <eos> in the overlong data samples. Note that we still mix this data with subset of SFT data from Stage 1, for which we use standard input masking, training on the entirely of all assistant turns. In Table 5 we refer to this condition as </think>-only Masking. To attempt to isolate the effect of the overlong data, we attempt to control for the inductive biases of the training framework, optimizer, and training hyperparameters. We do control run where we replace the 10,709 truncated overlong samples with 10,709 samples selected uniformly at random from the Stage 1 SFT dataset. In Table 5 we refer to this condition as Control. B.2 Results and discussion Our results are available in Table 5. Although Standard SFT and </think>-only are both trained on the exact same data mix, we find that altering the loss masking to train on only </think> (and <eos> from trainer design choice) has rather dramatic impact on the overlong rates - Standard SFT increased overlong rates for three of four reasoning benchmarks, while </think>-only training suppressed overlong rates to below 1% on all four benchmarks. However, applying this form of strict length control produced substantial performance degradation, reducing AIME24 accuracy by 20 percentage points. To mitigate this tradeoff, we repeated the Stage 2 supervised fine-tuning with more permissive 30k-token budget. This adjustment significantly reduced the extent of regression on reasoning benchmarks while still controlling excessive sequence lengths. One rather curious result was that the Control run boosted LiveCodeBench scores by 18%. We initially thought the Stage 1 result was mistake, so we repeated the evaluation twice only to find the same result. This may point to bug in our Stage 1 trainer that was corrected by the Stage 2 training. We also note that Stage 1 was trained at 16k context, while Stage 2 was trained on 32k context, and included small amount of reasoning data between 16k and 32k tokens. We wouldve preferred to omit this long-context reasoning data out for the experiment, but due to time constraints we decided to include it so that one of the models from this experiment could directly be used as release candidate. All four conditions of our experiment contain this data so they remain comparable. 19 Hermes 4 Technical Report Table 5: Comparison of overlong rates (Table 5a) and scores (Table 5b) across data mixes for the second stage of SFT on Hermes-4-Qwen3-14B. Overall we notice that </think>-only training suppressed overlong rates the most while suffering the largest hit on benchmarks. Stage 1 refers to the model after the initial SFT stage. We will call this model Stage 1 for brevity. Standard Masking refers to Stage 1 fine-tuned on mix of Stage 1 SFT data along with overlong fine-tuning samples containing </think> forced at 20k tokens followed by an on-policy answer attained via secondary completions-endpoint call. </think>-only Masking refers to similar setup as Standard Masking with the only difference being that the only tokens trained are </think> and <eos>. The unmasking of <eos> was not design choice of the experiment but rather facet of Axolotl. Control refers to the same setup as Standard Masking but with the 10,709 overlong samples replaced by 10,709-size uniform random subset of the Stage 1 SFT data. (a) Overlong rates (%). Lower is better. We take the definition of overlong to mean the model has not generated </think> within 32,768 output tokens. Training on only the </think> token suppresses overlong rates down to 0.6% or lower compared to starting point of up to 60.0%, 100x reduction. Overlong rates"

Key themes to include: - Geometry as horror: Emphasize the unnatural precision of the cut, like it defies mortal comprehension. - Transformation: Fries as \"fragments\" of some greater, terrifying potato entity. - Cosmic seasoning: Salt isnt just salt--its \"stardust\" or \"void crystals.\" - Consumption as sacrifice: Eating them becomes ritual, with ketchup as \"blood of mortal ketchup-beasts.\" Potential pitfalls to avoid: - Dont make it too grim; keep wink of humor. - Balance food vocabulary (\"golden,\" \"crisp\") with Lovecraftian jargon (\"cyclopean,\" \"non-Euclidean\"). Structure-wise, sonnet feels right--traditional form clashes deliciously with the absurd subject. Rhyme scheme ABAB for tension, shifting to volta at \"But lo!\" where the horror escalates.

The better first-cause arguments already anticipate atemporality and non-temporal dependence. If you want to kill them, you need precision. First, steelman your hunch Physics pathways: Timelessness: Wheeler-DeWitt; time emerges relationally (Barbour, Rovelli). first is category error. Block universe: B-theory of time; nothing begins to exist in tensed sense. asymmetric bookkeeping of correlations within 4D whole. Indefinite causal order: process-matrix experiments show no single global causal order; causal structure can be emergent/contextual. Quantum indeterminism: GRW-style collapses are genuinely uncaused events; even standard QM separates unitary law from stochastic outcomes. Indeterminism =/= no dynamics, but it does undercut every beginning has cause. Metaphysics pathways: Humean mosaic: no necessary connections; laws are summaries; PSR fails. Grounding-not-causation: the relevant dependence is atemporal grounding. or its well-foundedness, first cause loses its target. Now the unpleasant part: fix your target. three families, and your move hits some and misses others. Kalam (temporal cause of beginning) Premises: (1) Whatever begins to exist has cause. Therefore: How you actually beat it: Attack (1): generalization, not necessity. Attack begins to exist: emergent, talking about first instant is like asking for the north of the North Pole. Attack (2): rhetorical force of begins. Even granting the conclusion, cause neednt be an agent, timeless will, or anything theist-friendly. Your atemporal, acausal line works here, but only if you cash it out with one of the above. 2. Thomistic (concurrent, hierarchical dependence now) Not about temporal regress. Its about per se chains: non-derivative actualizer; no infinite regress; so first, concurrent cause. How to puncture it: Deny well-foundedness as metaphysical necessity: (think field-theoretic mutual determination; fixed points). circular grounding is impossible; they rarely supply one without question-begging. Reinterpret actualization: in physics, stable dispositions come from fields, symmetries, boundary conditions. No extra sustainer is doing work. If dependence is grounding, not causation, atemporal acausality by itself is irrelevant. must argue either that grounding doesnt require base or that the base is impersonal (laws, math, necessary structure). So simply saying reality is atemporal doesnt touch this unless you also reject well-founded grounding. 3. Leibnizian (Principle of Sufficient Reason for the totality of contingent facts) Every contingent fact has an explanation; the totality of contingent facts exists; therefore its explanation must be necessary (cue God). How to block it: Reject or restrict PSR. Statistical or brute explanations are legitimate; science runs on them. Challenge the move from each has an explanation to the totality has an explanation. Thats compositional fallacy plus self-reference headaches. Offer an alternative necessary terminus: nomological necessity as the ground. Again, acausality isnt enough. Where your claim needs surgery Illogical is wrong. unsound, then show where. Macro-ontological is hand-wavy. Most of these arguments are valid; the fight is over soundness. If youre acausal/atemporal, this is your lane. mathematical structure, logical necessity, or non-well-founded dependence is coherent If you mean coarse-grained, then note: here-and-now actualization requires You need principled stance on PSR.
