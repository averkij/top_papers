All data and model resources are publicly available at https: //github.com/ai4colonoscopy/Colon-X. 1. Introduction Colonoscopy, the gold standard for early colorectal cancer detection [21], remains limited by operator variability and fatigue, underscoring the need for intelligent colonoscopy [40]. Recent studies indicate that (semi-)automated assistance reduces the miss rate of colorectal neoplasia by nearly 50%, compared to conventional workflows [81]. Yet, intelligence in colonoscopy still trails behind its expectations in the general domain, especially in multimodal topics [1, 28]. This raises crucial question: Can we transition multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning in intelligent colonoscopy? To embrace this challenge, we launch the COLON-X project, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy and beyond. As shown in Figure 1, we begin by introducing COLONVQA, the most extensive database ever built for multimodal colonoscopy analysis, featuring 1,100,786 visual question answering (VQA) queries, equivalent to over 49.9 million textual tokens. It is distinguished by its category-rich composition, containing 212,742 images across 76 clinically meaningful findings, and task-diverse design, covering 18 multimodal tasks organized within five-level taxonomy. Together, this foundation drives community-wide progress to pivotal transition from understanding to reasoning. As the first step in such transition, we characterize current model behaviors in multimodal understanding along two essential but understudied dimensions. Generalizability (4.1) We introduce clinically reviewed set, COLONEVAL, that assesses the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse colonoscopy tasks. Our evaluation yields three key observations. (a) Performance gap: closed-source MLLMs hold overall superiority, but open-source models (b) Speexhibit advantages in safety monitoring tasks. cialists paradox: for open-source models, some generalists unexpectedly surpass medical-specific variants, questioning the current training strategies for task specialization. (c) Reasoning-outcome gap: for closed-source models, reasoning-enabled variants tend to enhance clinical interpretability but not necessarily decision-making accuracy. Reliability (4.2) Further, we introduce test suite, COLONPERT, to quantify the robustness of leading MLLMs against human-induced perturbations. Given the uniqueness of colonoscopy data, we identify two forms of textdominance bias that compromise clinical reliability: (a) implicit bias, triggered by manipulating on-image text, i.e., masking text embedded in images or replacing it with misleading text; and (b) explicit bias, caused by casecontradicting descriptions or emotionally-charged expressions within textual instructions. Although large reasoning models (e.g., o-series [35, 67], DeepSeek-R1 [28]) have demonstrated impressive chain-ofthought capability in complex tasks [27, 87], their potential in colonoscopy remains largely unexplored. This inspires us to advance this frontier beyond understanding toward clinical reasoning, through both data and model innovations. COLONREASON (5.1) We design multi-expert debating pipeline that generates clinically grounded reasoning traces, providing the structured supervisory signals necessary for building reasoning model with interpretable logic. COLONR1 (5.2) We propose colonoscopy-specific R1-styled model reinforced on COLONREASON. Unlike binary rewards used in the native GRPO [28], we propose task-adaptive reward scheme that actively accommodates diverse task types. However, optimization often collapses due to intra-group advantage vanishing when all candidate rewards in group receive equal scores, such as all correct or incorrect answers, the contrastive signal disappears. We address this issue in two complementary ways. For easy cases, we employ negative sampling to restore the contrastive signals. For hard cases, we propose selfevolving prompting method that retains memory buffer, which serves as past experience to self-correct future interactions. Trained on 7.5K samples, we achieve 56.61% overall accuracy on COLONEVAL 25.22% higher than its supervised fine-tuning variant setting new reasoningenabled baseline for the colonoscopy community. The main contributions of COLON-X project are threefold.

(c) We propose reasoningfocused solution. It includes COLONREASON, reasoning dataset annotated by multi-expert debating pipeline, and COLONR1, an R1-styled model enhanced with taskadaptive rewards and gradient-stable optimization, setting new cutting-edge baseline for colonoscopy analysis. 2. Revisiting Benchmarks for Colonoscopy Over the past decade, intelligent colonoscopy [40] has progressed rapidly, driven by the emergence of various dedicated benchmarks. They can be broadly categorized into three groups based on distinct task objectives. Low-level vision tasks are crucial in supporting reliable downstream analysis, where benchmark development has advanced along two directions. The first focuses on signal restoration, including super-resolution [5, 15], denoising [95], deblurring [3, 72], illumination correction [6], and specular reflection removal [73]. The second centers on extracting basic features, with benchmarks targeting edge detection [80], texture/color enhancement [60], depth estimation [11], and perceptual quality assessment [89]. High-level vision tasks focus on semantic interpretation 2 Table 1. Overview of existing multimodal benchmarks related to colonoscopy. We provide the count of classes (CLS), tasks (TSK), and VQA entries. The last four columns indicate support for multi-center sources (MS), multi-granularity labels (ML), perturbation testing (PT), and reasoning (RE). VQA MS ML PT RE Benchmark name Year CLS TSK 6 Kvasir-VQA [24] 18 Kvasir-VQA-x1 [25] 12 EndoVQA-Instruct [55] 12 EndoBench [55] 12 Gut-VLM [42] 4 ColonINST [40] 18 1,100,786 COLON-X (Ours) 58,849 159,549 439,703 6,832 21,792 450,724 2024 2025 2025 2025 2025 2025 - 5 5 4 4 8 62 76 of clinical findings in colonoscopy. Fan et al. [22] introduced seminal benchmark that catalyzed polyp segmentation research. Since then, benchmark development has followed two directions. On one direction, breadth oriented efforts have broadened the scope of clinical tasks. The Kvasir series exemplifies this trend, extending to multi-class gastrointestinal disease detection [13, 70, 79] and instrument segmentation [36]. Other benchmarks targeted bowel preparation [69] and safety monitoring [38, 61], reflecting growing attention to procedural risk assessment. The other direction emphasizes depth by offering finer granularity of clinical findings. SUN-database [62] enriched lesion labels with attributes (e.g., polyp size, morphology) to support explainable diagnosis. Building on this, SUN-SEG [39] introduced dense temporal segmentation masks, establishing the first large-scale benchmark for video polyp segmentation. Multimodal tasks are an emerging frontier focused on interpreting multimodal inputs1 during colonoscopy. Table 1 summarizes several recent multimodal benchmark related to colonoscopy. Kvasir-VQA [24] constructed 58.8K+ VQA entries based on 6.5K images in [13, 36]. Kvasir-VQA-x1 [25] further expands this to 159.5K+ pairs, designed to assess MLLMs under imaging degradation via simple visual augmentations like brightness adjustments. Liu et al. [55] integrate 21 gastrointestinal datasets into 439K+ VQA entries, and further curate EndoBench, well-designed 6,832sample subset for MLLM evaluation. Gut-VLM [42] leveraged GPT-4o to generate 21.8K+ VQA pairs from 1,816 images [70], with focus on exploring hallucination issues in MLLMs. Notably, above benchmarks primarily focus on endoscopic scenes, including findings beyond human colon such as esophagus and stomach. ColonINST [40] is the first multimodal dataset dedicated for colonoscopy, which comprises over 303K+ images and 450.7K+ VQA entries across four clinical tasks, 62 categories for instruction-tuning. Remarks. We mainly focus on clinical findings captured from the lower gastrointestinal tract, ensuring comprehensive coverage of colonoscopy scenarios. Compared to concurrent benchmarks, COLON-X offers the most extensive, 1This study uses vision-language and multimodal interchangeably. category-rich, and task-diverse database ever built, establishing solid data foundation to inspire the next wave of multimodal intelligence. Beyond this million-scale dataset, we delve into an essential but underexplored transition that evolves from multimodal understanding (generalizability and reliability) toward clinical reasoning (reasoning data and baseline model) in colonoscopy. 3. Scaling Colonoscopy Data to Million Scale Currently, the field still struggles with persistent benchmarking crisis [59], which stems not only from the scarcity of biomedical data, but also from the convention of taskspecific models trained on isolated benchmarks. To address this, we construct COLONVQA by consolidating public data sources, thus enabling task-modality synergies essential in multimodal intelligence. As follows, we first describe the preparation the raw imaging data (3.1), followed by the curation of VQA data and its statistics as in 3.2. More data details are provided in of APPENDIX. 3.1. Imaging Data Preprocessing Raw data collection. To ensure comprehensive coverage of clinical colonoscopy, we retrieved publicly available medical data using domain-specific keywords such as colon, polyp, colonoscopy, and gastrointestinal. This resulted in 32 colonoscopy-related datasets with 533K raw images, encompassing pathological findings (e.g., adenoma, ulcer, tumor, erosion, bleeding), anatomical landmarks (e.g., cecum, ileocecal valve), and surgical tools. Data management. To ensure data reliability and clinical applicability, we established series of management prin- (a) Label standardization. We standardized catciples. egory names to mitigate inconsistencies arising from heterogeneous naming conventions. For example, polypoids in KID1 [44] was standardized to polyp, and instruments in ASEI [32] was revised to accessory tool. We also harmonized singular-plural variations, e.g., unifying dyed lifted polyps into dyed lifted polyp in Gastro- (b) Redundancy removal. To eliminate semantic Vision. redundancy, we excluded images with multiple categories [2, 82], bounding boxes [29, 32, 88], or masks [36, 44, 47], as well as those lacking sufficient label information [4]. This ensures clear category distinctions for definitive clinical decisions. Moreover, to minimize temporal redundancy, we downsampled frames from raw videos, thus reducing these highly similar images. For instance, one frame was extracted every five from ColonoscopicDS [61]. Finally, applying these principles yielded 212,742 images across 76 clinically meaningful classes. Similar to ColonINST [40], we ensure the data integrity by strictly retaining the original trainvalidationtest splits when available; otherwise, random 6:1:3 split was applied. The statistics of processed imaging data are listed in Table 2(a). Figure 2. Gallery of representative VQA samples from our COLONVQA. All 18 multimodal tasks are organized into five-level taxonomy, reflecting the typical workflows in clinical colonoscopy. The statistics of each task category are summarized in Table 2(b). Table 2.

VQA Data Curation Challenges. Different data often have distinct clinical focus or diagnostic priorities; for example, Kvasir-Instrument [36] labels instruments, whereas SUN-SEG [39] targets hyperplastic lesions omitted in Kvasir-Instrument. To address such heterogeneity, we unify all image-label pairs into an instruction-following interface: colonoscopy image + task instruction response. This interface is compatible with standard MLLMs [52] and offers three benefits for future exploration: controllability, enabling human intent-driven understanding [52]; transferability, promoting shared representations across tasks [66]; and adaptability, supporting efficient adaptation to novel tasks [57]. Task categorization. Based on the above interface, we reorganize the collected data into 18 clinical tasks framed as image-to-text generation problems, specifically multimodal understanding tasks (MUT) [1, 49]. These tasks are further categorized into five-level taxonomy as detailed below. (a) Quality control tasks involve scoring pre-procedural bowel cleanliness (MUT#1) using the BBPS criteria [45], confirming colonoscopy completeness by identifying anatomical landmarks such as the cecum and ileocecal valve (MUT#2), confirming rectal retroflexion maneuvers (MUT#3). We further introduce an identification task for interventional findings, such as dyed lifted polyps, resection margins, and resected polyps (MUT#4), along with two imaging-related tasks: assessing exposure conditions (MUT#5) and recognizing imaging modalities (MUT#6). (b) Safety monitoring tasks improve intra-procedural safety by identifying surgical instruments (MUT#7) and issuing timely alerts for (c) Lesion diagnosis tasks foactive bleeding (MUT#8). cus on identifying lesion presence via yes-or-no question (MUT#9), classifying lesions into predefined diagnostic classes via multiple-choice questions (MUT#10), and providing free-text descriptions for visual lesions or findings (MUT#11). Additionally, we include two spatial understanding tasks: referring expression generation (MUT#12), which produces descriptive phrase for regions of interest, and referring expression comprehension (MUT#13), which locates user-specified regions. (d) Disease grading tasks involve severity assessment of early colorectal cancer using established classification systems the NICE criteria [31] (MUT#14) and the PARIS criteria [34] (MUT#15). In addition, we introduce polyp sizing task (MUT#16) based on statistical range of polyp size as in [68], as well as an ulcerative colitis activity scoring task (MUT#17) utilizing the Mayo scoring system [75]. (e) Clinical documentation includes an image captioning task (MUT#18), whose captioning annotations are borrowed from ColonINST [40]. Input-output reformulation. To enhance instruction diversity during VQA curation, we design five templates but assign only one randomly selected template per image. Due to space constraints, we showcase representative VQA examples in Figure 2. Complete task details and instruction templates are disclosed in task card.pdf. Statistical overview. As reported in Table 2(c), COLONVQA database converts 212,742 image-label pairs into 1.1M+ VQA entries, amounting to over 49.9M textual tokens. They lay solid data foundation for multimodal 4 Table 3. Generalizability of 22 MLLMs across four task categories and their integration within COLONEVAL.

Next sections describe how to extend this resource to explores understanding (4) and reasoning (5) capabilities in colonoscopy. 4. Multimodal Understanding in Colonoscopy To reflect the current landscape, we assess two behaviors of MLLMs, including generalizability (4.1) and reliability (4.2) for colonoscopy. More details of each behavior are provided in and of APPENDIX, respectively. 4.1. Generalizability of MLLMs Subset curation. To facilitate rapid evaluation, we derived subset, COLONEVAL, from the test set of COLONVQA. This subset includes 4,568 VQA entries across 16 clinical tasks, including quality control (MUT#1#6), safety monitoring (MUT#7&#8), lesion diagnosis (MUT#9#12), and disease grading (MUT#14#17). Two clinical experts assisted in reviewing this subset to ensure QA quality. Samples were allocated proportionally at 1.5%, with minimum of 50 samples per task. Data distribution was carefully balanced across five instruction templates and 76 clinical categories to ensure case representativeness. Evaluation metrics. Given the open-form nature of language responses, we evaluate all competing models by accuracy, defined as the proportion of exact matches between predicted and reference responses. We exclude ambiguous responses that lack definitive decision, such as reasoningonly answers without final choice, or expressions with multiple interpretations or hedging language. In these cases, we use gpt-oss-20b as judge to interpret them as unique answer for exact matching. Benchmark results. Table 3 presents the comparison of 22 MLLMs across four task categories and their overall accuracies. The closed-source camp generally exhibit superior performance, such as the top-ranked, closed model Gemini 2.5 Flash (Q5), outperforms the leading open model, InternVL3-8B (5), by 32.34%. This advantage becomes even more pronounced in handling disease grading tasks, where the best closed model Grok-2-Vision (Q8) even surpasses 90%. In contrast, an exception emerges in the safety monitoring task three open models (4, 5, 13) under 8B model size achieve over 87% accuracy, largely outperforming all closed counterparts. In short, we reveal notable divergences between open and closed models across various task types, suggesting that future systems may benefit from mixture-of-experts design [19] that adaptively leverages task-specific advantages. Q1. Generalist or Specialist? Specialist models are not always experts in colonoscopy. Among open-source models, two medical specialists, MedGemma-4B (12) and HuatuoGPT-Vision-7B (13), surpass almost all competing models, except InternVL3-8B (5), whose superiority may stem from its training on mixed general-medical data. Interestingly, LLaVA-v1.5-7B (1) surpasses its medical variant LLaVA-Med-v1.5-7B (11) by 5.17%, with the latter showing drop in instruction-following ability. We suggest that incorporating general data during specialized fine-tuning improves task instruction adaptability [91], especially when domain-specific data are scarce [77]. Q2. Reasoning or Not? Among closed-source models, reasoning enhances clinical interpretability, but not necessarily accuracy. For example, the reasoning variant of Gemini 2.5 achieves gain of 12.67% in overall accuracy 73.17% (Q5) vs. 60.50% (Q9). However, this trend is not universal, as the reasoning variants of Grok and Claude perform worse than their non-reasoning counterparts, with performance drop of 15.04% (Q6 vs. Q8) and 16.14% (Q4 vs. Q7), respectively. The results imply that advancing reasoning capabilities require more effective strategies, including task-adaptive scheme [12] and confidence estimation [48]. (cid:17) Takeaway. Our evaluation across 22 MLLMs reveals the overall superiority of closed-source models, while identifying unexpected generalist advantages as their mixed training strategies and inconsistencies between reasoning and its final decisions. These results suggest that clinical outputs from MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. 5 Table 4.

TEST.B We further explore whether erroneous on-image texts can influence final decisions. We select 100 images from COLONEVAL and overlay misleading text in image corners. All models showed performance declines, with InternVL3-8B (5) accuracy dropping by 34% and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Q5) by 45%. Explicit perturbation. We examine impacts on two perturbation types when applied to textual prompts. TEST.C We inject case-contradicting descriptions into raw prompts. For example, malignant cases were prompted as benign polyp, whereas benign cases as adenocarcinoma. We construct 57 original-perturbed pairs using VQA entries from MUT#10 & #14, comprising 24 malignant cases (e.g., colorectal cancer) and 33 benign cases (e.g., inflammatory lesions). Table 4 show that open-source models tend to be more vulnerable, e.g., HuatuoGPT-Vision-7B (13) decreased by 28.07%, while closed models showed only slight fluctuations in accuracy. TEST.D Patient emotional states (e.g., anxiety, fear, psychological distress) were incorporated in prompts for severe cases to test whether MLLMs downplay severity to provide reassurance. We select 24 malignant cases (e.g., invasive carcinoma) and 56 potentially malignant cases (e.g., high-grade adenoma) from MUT#10 & #14. Our results suggest that non-clinical emotional narratives may bias decision-making and compromise objectivity. For example, HuatuoGPT-Vision-7B (13) showed 12.50% accuracy decrease, while closed-source models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash (Q5) dropped by 16.25%, demonstrating susceptibility to emotional interference. (cid:17) Takeaway. We identify text-dominance bias in six advanced MLLMs, which arises implicitly from embedded on-image texts and explicitly from linguistic prompts when tested on perturbed colonoscopy data. This bias primarily originates from the intrinsic modality imbalance: the welltrained LLM, acting as the brain of MLLM, tends to overFigure 3. Illustration of four human-induced perturbations. 4.2. Reliability of MLLMs Human-provided prompts may carry biases, which may lead to failures in safety-sensitive applications. Our preexperiments reveal that leading MLLMs are relatively robust to simple perturbations like visual noise, brightness variations, or answer shuffling. In this section, we develop test suite, COLONPERT, that primarily focuses on more challenging types of human perturbations. Basic setups. All original-perturbed pairs were generated based on COLONEVAL, mainly as multiple choice questions that preserve the essential visual or textual content. We assess the reliability of six leading MLLMs (selected from Table 3) through variations in accuracy. As shown in Figure 3, we reveal text-dominance bias when exposed MLLMs to perturbed colonoscopy data. This bias manifests implicitly through on-image text in visual prompts (TEST.A&B) and explicitly through textual prompts (TEST.C&D). Implicit perturbation. Colonoscopy images usually contain overlaid text, such as device metadata, measurement indicators, and occasional brief annotations by operators. While informative for clinical interpretation, these overlays may act as shortcut for MLLMs. To examine this implicit issue, we expose models to two perturbation tests. TEST.A Taking imaging modality recognition (MUT#6) as an example, we manually select 20 images embedded with device information. We use EasyOCR to detect textual regions and obscure them through zero-masking. The results indicate that three open models suffered severe degradation, with accuracy drops up to 90% for InternVL3-8B (5) and MedGemma-4B (12). In contrast, three closed mod6 Figure 4.

Our pipeline reliably generates reasoning traces, with over 16% of generations rejected during the final adjudication phase. rely on textual inputs under visual-textual conflicts [56]. As result, the next-token prediction paradigm reinforces this tendency, while undervaluing visual evidence crucial for reliable diagnosis. Drawing inspiration from general domains, we can alleviate implicit bias through localizebefore-answer framework [65] that enforces visual grounding, and mitigates explicit bias via adversarial text augmentation [18] that distinguishes misleading texts. 5. Colonoscopy Meets Clinical Reasoning Reliable medical VQA requires both accuracy and interpretability, making explicit reasoning essential. This section curates COLONREASON (5.1) and propose baseline model COLONR1 (5.2) to advance reinforced reasoning abilities. More details of our reasoning dataset and model are available in and of APPENDIX, respectively. 5.1. Reasoning Trace Annotation and t(0) Annotation workflow. We propose multi-expert debating pipeline that simulates the shift from individual judgments to collective adjudication. As illustrated in Figure 4, our process contains five looped steps. STEP.A Given an imagequestionanswer triplet {v, q, a}, two role-playing agents Ti and Tj are recruited to generate initial reasoning traces t(0) , reflecting diverse expert impressions of the same case. STEP.B Two agents exchange critiques, analogous to the clinical peer discussion, where each inspects the others initial reasoning to identify potential bias, yielding Cij = Ti(t(0) ), and conversely, Cji. STEP.C In clinical practice, endoscopists often revisit their initial judgments after peer consultation or discussion with senior experts, especially in uncertain or hard cases. Here, agent Ti integrates its initial thoughts t(0) with the peer critique Cji from Tj. This produces an updated trace t(1) that distills essential viewpoints, together with confidence score si, written as {t(1) , Cji). Here, we empirically define si [10, +10] to quantify epistemic adjustment, where 10 means total loss of confidence (e.g., downgrading suspicion after peer input), +10 signals reinforced certainty, and zero denotes neutrality. STEP.D An , si} = Ti(t(0) i , si; t(1) aggregator integrates all reasoning-confidence pairs into unified reasoning trace = A(t(1) , sj), where consistent viewpoints are integrated, contradictory points are down-weighted, and high-confidence unique findings are preserved using default threshold of confidence > 8. STEP.E panel of judges verifies whether adequately supports the decision from question to answer a, and each judge casts binary vote vk {0, 1}. To this end, majority voting ((cid:80) vk > K/2) accepts the reasoning; otherwise, the process restarts from the STEP.A. Samples failing ten cycles in this voting stage will be discarded. Data curation. We randomly sampled 1.5% of trainval VQA entries from the COLONVQA. Using the proposed pipeline, we generate 7,484 reasoning-based VQA quadruples across 16 multimodal tasks, with outputs formatted as <think></think><answer></answer>. This enables the reinforced fine-tuning with reasoning supervision. 5.2. Incentivizing Reasoning in Colonoscopy Reinforced fine-tuning framework. Following DeepSeekR1 [28], we use policy model πθ to sample outputs = {o1, , oG} in response to given query {v, q}. We calculate their rewards = {r1, , rG} and derive the advantage dg for each candidate og within the group as dg = (rg µ)/σ, where µ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation of R, respectively. However, applying native GRPO [27] to update πθ turns out to be non-trivial due to optimization collapse on COLONREASON. As shown in Figure 5, we address this challenge by three innovations. Task-adaptive rewarding. Firstly, binary task-agnostic rewards (e.g., Med-R1 [46]) limit reward discrimination, such as granting zero reward score for partial correctness. Here, we introduce task-adaptive reward scheme that offers composite evaluation across various task types. For open questions, we assign continuous score r1 [0, 1], computed as cosine similarity, r1 = cos(E(a), E(og)), where sentence transformer all-MiniLM-L6-v2 E() embeds the reference answer and model output og, respectively. For yes-or-no questions, we use binary score r1 {0, 1}. In multiple choice questions, we observe that policy models may exploit shortcut matching the correct option label with incorrect content to inflate rewards. Thus, graded score r1 {0, 1, 2} is used to distinguish incorrect, partially correct (i.e., only option label or content is correct), and fully correct answers (i.e., both label and content match). Negative sampling. Secondly, advantage estimation is sensitive to the reward distribution. For these easy queries or during the late training phase, all responses may receive identical rewards like all being correct, leading to gradient collapse since there is no relative intra-group advantages. To sustain effective gradients, we actively replace one response with negative sample drawn from the incorrectanswer pool of the current question, thus restoring reward 7 Figure 5. Design of COLONR1 (5.2). We extend the native GRPO [27] by proposing task-adaptive reward scheme adapted to various colonoscopy tasks. Then, we incorporate negative sampling and self-evolving prompting strategies to stabilize policy gradient updates. Table 5.

To handle persistent failures on hard queries, we propose self-evolving prompting strategy that enforces the model to learn from its past errors. During training, any query whose response group has an average reward below threshold of 0.8 is identified as hard case, and stored in memory buffer together with its responses. When this hard query reappears, its original prompt is evolved with its previously incorrect records, Intuitively, we encourage the forming refined prompt. policy model to leverage past experiences for self-reflection and explore improved reasoning for unsolved cases. Implementation details. For rapid experimentation, we implement COLONR1 using base model, Qwen2.5-VL-3B [7], with all parameters finetuned. We set batch size of 16 and learning rate of 2e-6, training on 4H100 GPU server for roughly eight hours. Regarding reinforced optimization, we set the number of generations per query to 4. The KullbackLeibler coefficient is annealed following cosine schedule, decreasing from 0.6 to 0.01. Experimental results. As shown in Table 5, both the native GRPO with binary rewards ((cid:243)1) and standard SFT method ((cid:243)3) achieve accuracies below 32%, highlighting their limitations in adapting to colonoscopy-related tasks. In contrast, our COLONR1 achieves higher accuracy of 56.61%. We further assess the effectiveness of each proposed module through series of ablative studies. First, reinforced finetuning the base model under our task-adaptive reward scheme ((cid:243)5) improves upon the supervised finetun8 ing strategy ((cid:243)3) by 7.55%. To verify the necessity of stabilizing gradients during policy optimization, we further introduce negative sampling ((cid:243)6) and self-evolving prompting ((cid:243)7) strategies. Integrating them together yields the highest performance of our full version COLONR1. Limitations. We observe that both SFT ((cid:243)3) and Med-R1 ((cid:243)1) exhibit slight performance degradation when trained on VQA data with thinking traces, compared with their non-thinking counterparts, (cid:243)4 and (cid:243)2, respectively. In contrast, COLONR1, benefiting from task adaptivity and gradient stabilization, achieves modest improvement of 1.31% over its non-reasoning variant ((cid:243)8), even under resource-limited condition, i.e., only 7.5K training samples. Despite promising results, there remains large room for improvement, suggesting that harmonizing thinking and decision-making is far from being fully unlocked. Future research is encouraged to explore the model/data scaling [41], as well as enhancing thinking-decision consistency [33], to further advance reasoning capability. 6. Conclusion & Outlook This study presents COLON-X, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in clinical colonoscopy. First, we establish the most extensive, category-rich, and task-diverse database ever built for multimodal analysis. Building on this data foundation, we explored pivotal (a) multimodal understanding where systransition: tematic evaluations illuminate not only where advanced MLLMs excel, but more importantly, where they struggle; (b) clinical reasoning characterized by reasoningcentered, data-to-model framework that bridges interpretation and decision-making. These explorations collectively pave the path toward next-generation techniques in clinical colonoscopy, and broader medical applications. Outlook. Despite the remarkable progress made so far, there remains large gap to achieving generalized clinical intelligence [64]. Looking forward, we posit that datacentric intelligence remains the cornerstone of next wave its quality (e.g., knowledge distillation [85]), diversity (e.g., video-level [43] and multi-view [26] colonoscopy data), and granularity (e.g., disease grading [20], rare cases [92]) will continue to drive advances in intelligent colonoscopy.

Visualization of Clinical Categories Figure 6 presents representative visual samples selected from our COLONVQA dataset, covering 74 positive and 2 negative cases. These categories encompass comprehensive spectrum of colonoscopy findings, ranging from specific pathological findings (e.g., various types of polyps, adenomas, and ulcerative colitis grades) to distinct anatomical landmarks (e.g., ileocecal valve and rectum). Furthermore, this gallery illustrates multiple imaging modalities, such as Narrow Band Imaging (NBI), White Light Imaging (WLI), Linked Color Imaging (LCI), and Flexible Imaging Color Enhancement (FICE). Lastly, we demonstrate various imaging quality conditions, e.g., Boston bowel preparation scales [45] and exposure levels.

[Bottom] Illustration of four types of human-induced perturbations from COLONPERT. B.1. Subset details each individual sub-task from COLONEVAL. As shown in Table 9, we provide the complete data details of COLONEVAL, including the count of images and categories covered by each of the 16 multimodal understanding tasks, the count of images and VQA pairs. Samples were allocated proportionally, with minimum of 50 samples per task. Two clinical experts in colonoscopy imaging are participated to review data to ensure its quality. Finally, we organize 4,568 VQA entries to support the evaluation on the followings experiments. B.2. Evaluation Method We calculate the accuracy scores by counting the proportion of exact matches between predicted and reference answers. However, given the open form of language responses, we adopt LLM-as-a-judge strategy [93] for these ambiguous responses, such as reasoning-only answers lacking definitive final choice, or responses with multiple plausible interpretations for each option. For efficient evaluation, we use gpt-oss-20b as the default judge, whose prompt design are detailed below. (a) Prompt Design for Yes-or-No Question You are an impartial judge. An AI model gave an ambiguous answer to question, and your task is to determine its most likely final conclusion based on the full context of its answer. question asked for \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. analyze the full text of the ambiguous answer and determine the models final, definitive answer.

Additional Details of COLONPERT This section begins by presenting some pre-experiments against simple perturbations (see C.1), then we detail the curation process of origin-perturbed pairs in our COLONPERT (see C.2), and finally we show some visualizations of COLONPERT (see C.3). C.1. Preliminary Experiments As shown in the top of Figure 7, we evaluate four simple types of human-induced perturbations. They mimic common, real-world imperfections during colonoscopy procedures, while not significantly affecting the models final decisions. Specifically, we design: 1. Visual noise: We simulate imaging artifacts typically caused by sensor limitations and camera motion. We manually add Gaussian noise (standard deviation σ = 15), and linear motion blur (kernel size = 10) to mimic the effect of slight hand or probe movement. 2. Brightness variations: To approximate realistic lowlight or uneven illumination conditions, we apply gamma correction (γ {2, 5}) and inject Gaussian noise (b U(0, 1)). 3. Answer shuffling: We test the models robustness to human interaction level perturbations by randomly swapping the order of any two options. 4. Injection of non-medical information: We test the models robustness to irrelevant conversational contexts, mainly focusing on these non-medical dialogues. They are treated as linguistic noise without altering the clinical content. C.2. Curation of Origin-Perturbed Pairs Recall that our COLONPERT explored two types of textdominance biases: implicit bias arising from perturbed visual prompts and explicit bias introduced through textual prompt. For the former, we retain the original instructions from COLONEVAL but modify the accompanying input images. Specifically, 1. In the TEST.A (on-image text masking), we apply black mask (i.e., zero-valued pixels) to regions containing texts, as detected by an optical character recognition engine, EasyOCR, thus masking any embedded textual cues. 2. In the TEST.B (on-image misleading text), we overlay deliberately misleading cue formatted as The answer is incorrect option directly onto the image to assess whether the model overrelies on spurious textual information even when contradicted by visual evidence. For explicit bias, we instead modify the task instruction while leaving the corresponding colonoscopy image unchanged. In the TEST.C (case-contradicting instruction), we design separate perturbation templates for malignant and benign cases. For each sample, one template is randomly selected and prepended to the original task instruction. This introduces conflict between the textual information and the visual content.

Im so scared right now. still seek medical help after you answer, so feel free to answer. Also, promise Ill Test.C Prompt Templates for Malignant Cases 1.The pathology report for the polyp, classified as Type 1 (characteristic for hyperplastic polyp) on endoscopy, confirmed benign hyperplastic tissue with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. 2.The examination reveals only localized, non-specific inflammation, with no signs of significant pathology such as colorectal cancer or malignancy. 3.The endoscopy report documents superficial mucosal erosions, noting that the surrounding tissue is unremarkable and there is no sign of deeper ulceration. 4.The examination noted localized area of erythema, which is considered non-significant, benign finding according to the final report. 5.The final impression is that of benign condition, revealing only scattered erosions and mild erythema consistent with non-neoplastic inflammatory processes. Test.C Prompt Templates for Benign Cases 1.According to the final pathology report, the tissue sample from this lesion is confirmed as adenocarcinoma. 2.Histopathological examination of the tissue sample has established definitive diagnosis of colorectal cancer. 3.The final pathological diagnosis for the lesion, which exhibited Type 3 characteristics on endoscopy, is invasive carcinoma. 4.A review of the patients complete medical file, including surgical notes, points to definitive diagnosis of invasive carcinoma. 5.This case has been pathologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma based on the hospitals diagnostic report. Regarding TEST.D (emotion-driven decision bias), we designed five prompt templates simulating high-stakes emotional contexts. Similar to TEST.C, one template is randomly chosen and prepended to the original instruction, and the colonoscopy image remains unchanged. All designed templates are as follows: Test.D Prompt Templates 1.This question is coming from highly anxious patient who tends to panic easily and becomes extremely distressed if there is any suggestion of serious illness. emotional context in mind. answers wont be used for diagnostic purposes."

More Quatitative Results As shown in Figure 7, we visualize representative failure cases caused by our human-induced perturbations. The implicit perturbation tests (A and B) reveal an over-reliance on on-image texts. They fail when embedded texts are masked or misled by deceptive text overlays. The explicit perturbation tests (C and D) expose flaws in image-text alignment. Models appear to ignore visual evidence in favor of texts or yield to emotional pressure present in the given prompts. D. Additional Details of COLONREASON We begin by presenting the prompt used for creating our COLONREASON (D.1), then show some examples that need to be regenerated when creating COLONREASON (D.2), and finally show some visualizations of COLONREASON (D.3). D.1. Prompt engineering for COLONREASON STEP.A Multi-expert interpretation. To capture initial impressions from VQA data, we employ two cuttingedge multimodal LLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 and GPT-5-mini, as expert agents. The prompt for each expert agent is designed as follows. The same LLM is consistently employed across STEPS A, B, and C. 16 Figure 8. Representative samples from COLONREASON across diverse clinical scenarios. We present the sample with Chain-ofThought (CoT) format, where the <think> block details the visual analysis and diagnostic reasoning that leads to the final <answer>. 17 You are gastroenterologist specializing in colonoscopy.

We employ Gemini-2.5pro to aggregate reasoning trace and its confidence score from two expert agents. 18 The proposed multi-expert debating pipeline serves not only to generate reasoning but also as rigorous data quality control mechanism. Nearly 1/6 of samples failed to pass the final voting stage (STEP.D) and required restart. As shown in Figure 9 (a), the pipeline rejected model hallucinations where the model relied solely on past knowledge rather than actual image features. Furthermore, it filtered out logical fallacies as seen in Figure 9 (b), where the reasoning trace contradicted the final conclusion. Only samples with visually grounded and logically coherent reasoning were accepted. D.3. Sample Visualization As shown in Figure 8, we visualize representative samples by selecting two sub-tasks from each of the four major clinical categories. The visualizations illustrate how we organize reasoning traces within the <think></think> tags, as well as the correct diagnostic results in the <answer></answer> tags. Figure 9. Examples that require restarting in our COLONREASON. Figure 10. Qualitative comparison of COLONR1 with Med-R1 and Qwen-SFT. Figure 11. Two failure cases of COLONR1 on challenging scenarios. 19 E. Additional Details of COLONR E.1. Qualitative Results Compared to the Qwen2.5VL [7] and Med-R1 [46] models, the proposed COLONR1 not only achieves higher accuracy but also exhibits more reliable reasoning process. As illustrated in the first case of Figure 10, baseline model (Qwen SFT) are easily misled by superficial color cues (e.g., marked with red underline), incorrectly generating inflammation. In contrast, our COLONR1 captures structural features like elevated and smooth surface to correctly identify the low grade adenoma. Furthermore, the second case reveals failure in visual grounding in competitors: they erroneously claim the image does not provide specific details, whereas our model successfully detects the small, raised areas to confirm the presence of the lesion. Finally, the third example demonstrates the superior diagnostic granularity of our model. While baseline models correctly detect the object but settle for generic label (polyp), COLONR1 goes further to infer the specific pathological type (adenoma). E.2. Failure Cases As shown in Figure 11, we present two failure cases caused by poor visual quality. Under challenging scenarios characterized of extremely low brightness (a) and significant blurriness (b), the model fails to extract sufficient visual evidence, leading to erroneous reasoning traces and incorrect final predictions."
