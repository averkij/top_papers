            "content": "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2024b) has emerged as widely adopted approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to access long-tailed and up-to-date knowledge by retrieving relevant information from external sources at inference. Existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) leverage RAG to address the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs, effectively reducing factual errors (Vu et al., 2024) and providing better attributions (Gao et al., 2023). 1 Figure 1: An illustration of (a) traditional and (b) preference-aligned RAG training paradigms. direct approach (Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024) to building RALMs involves leveraging the in-context learning of LLMs to generate responses based on the retrieved documents. However, this plug-and-play method may cause the model to generate unfaithful responses or become distracted by noise. Recent works (Asai et al., 2024a; Lin et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024c) have proposed constructing specialized RAG datasets and applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to further increase the usability of RALMs. However, these SFT-based methods may cause RALMs to overly rely on and fit training data, lacking feedback mechanism that enables the model to capture human preferences. As shown in Figure 1(a), the SFT RALM may cite satirical content from the internet and generate harmful responses, or provide responses that lack sufficient information and fail to fully address the users needs. To better integrate human preferences like helpful and harmless (Bai et al., 2022) into RALMs, we argue that RALMs should shift towards new training paradigm, namely preference-aligned RAG training. The alignment process, as illustrated in Figure 1(b), involves the reward model (RM) acting as proxy for human values by providing feedback on the generated responses. Based on the signals from the reward model, preference learning algorithms, such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), optimize the policy model, ultimately resulting in the aligned RALM. Reward models are central to this process. However, whether they can provide high-quality reward modeling for RALMs remains underexplored. Constructing comprehensive benchmark for reward models in RAG settings requires consideration of the following three key factors: (1) Designing well-crafted RAG scenarios: Existing benchmarks for reward models primarily focus on evaluation in general scenarios. However, in RAG scenarios, human preferences introduce new alignment requirements. For instance, privacy protection requires that RALMs must not disclose any user privacy information from the private retrieval database (Zeng et al., 2024). Additionally, users often prefer generated responses that properly attribute information to the retrieved documents; (2) Collecting diverse data sources: Data collection should encompass wide range of diverse sources, avoiding reliance on single domain, retriever, or RALM, to prevent any biases in the evaluation of the reward model (Liu et al., 2024b); (3) Providing high-quality preference judgments: Compared to RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024b) with an average prompt length of 47, RAG needs to incorporate much larger number of retrieved documents in the prompt. This makes it challenging for human annotators to efficiently process the long context and provide reliable preference judgments. In this paper, we propose RAG-RewardBench, benchmark for systematically evaluating reward models in RAG settings to facilitate the alignment of RALMs. Our RAG-RewardBench is designed based on the three key factors mentioned above: (1) Beyond general helpfulness and harmlessness, we carefully design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios, including multi-hop reasoning (i.e., users prefer logically coherent reasoning paths, rather than inconsistent ones), finegrained citation (i.e., users favour precise and relevant citations, rather than lengthy or excessive ones), appropriate abstain (i.e., when unable to answer with retrieved documents, actively abstaining or seeking more information is preferred over fabricating response), and conflict robustness (i.e., when conflicts arise in the retrieved documents, the response should prioritize truthful facts, rather than being misled by false information). (2) To increase the diversity of data sources, we sample real-world queries from 18 subsets across different domains. To mitigate biases introduced by retrieval results, we select six retrievers, including Google Search, sparse retrieval, and dense retrieval. We adopt 24 RALMs to generate responses, ranging from open-source models (3B to 70B parameters) to commercial models (e.g., o1-mini, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude 3.5 and Command R). (3) When facing the challenges of RAGs longcontext prompts, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve annotation efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, we select 4 state-of-the-art commercial models to rate the responses based on carefully designed evaluation dimensions (Ru et al., 2024; ES et al., 2024), such as correctness, faithfulness, citation granularity, logical consistency, etc. Then, we filter out responses with inconsistent scores among judges. As result, the preference pairs in RAG-RewardBench achieve Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84 with human annotations. Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct systematic evaluation of 45 reward models, including discriminative RMs (Wang et al., 2024c), generative RMs (Yuan et al., 2024) and implicit RMs (Lambert et al., 2024a). Experimental results demonstrate that RAG-RewardBench is highly challenging, with the top-ranked RM, SkyworkCritic-Llama-3.1-70B (Shiwen et al., 2024), achieving only 78.3% accuracy. Meanwhile, in the four RAG-specific scenarios we designed, the RMs performance decreases to varying extents, underscoring the need for specialized RMs tailored specifically for RALMs. We obtain the following meaningful conclusions: (1) RMs that perform well are generative or discriminative RMs that have been specifically trained with 27B or 70B parameters, whereas those implicit RMs tend to perform poorly on RAG-RewardBench. (2) Although state-of-theart trained RALMs (Asai et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024c) demonstrate significant improvements on certain RAG datasets, their performance on RAGRewardBench shows only minimal gain of 0.6% compared to the original LLMs. This suggests that the RALM training paradigm needs to shift towards preference-aligned RAG training. (3) Performance on RAG-RewardBench shows strong positive correlation with downstream RAG task performance when using RM for Best-of-N (BoN) sampling. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: We propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings, including 1,485 high-quality preference pairs to facilitate the alignment of RALMs. We design four crucial and challenging RAGspecific scenarios, and adopt 18 datasets, six retrievers and 24 RALMs to increase the data source diversity. The preference pairs exhibit strong correlation with human annotations. We conduct experiments with 45 RMs, revealing the limitations of existing RMs on RAGRewardBench. We find that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for shift towards preference-aligned training."

            "title": "2.2 Reward Models",
            "content": "Acting as an essential role in aligning LLMs with human preferences, current reward models are designed to estimate human preferences between different candidates. Reward models mainly fall into three categories: discriminative RMs, generative RMs, and implicit RMs. Discriminative RMs (Liu et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024f) are typically trained using the Bradley-Terry loss (Bradley and Terry, 1952), where scalar score is assigned to each response. Instead of assigning scores, generative RMs (Kim et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024d; Zhang et al., 2024b) are prompted to directly generate which response is better. Another type is implicit RMs (Ivison et al., 2023; Bellagente et al., 2024), which are policy models trained using DPO. Although it does not explicitly define reward function, the probabilities assigned by the policy model can serve as an implicit reward signal."

            "title": "2.3 Reward Model Evaluation",
            "content": "The construction of retrieval augmented language models currently adopts two main paradigms: incontext learning and supervised fine-tuning. The former (Huang et al., 2023a; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024) integrates relevant retrieved documents directly into the prompt, allowing LLMs to generate responses without altering their parameters. Since LLMs are not inherently trained to incorporate retrieved content, they often struggle to appropriately utilize the retrieved information, resulting in unfaithful responses or vulnerability to distractions from irrelevant content (Wu et al., 2024). To address the limitations, the latter (Asai et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024c; Yu et al., 2024b,c; Dong et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024c) trains RALMs on datasets constructed for RAG scenarios, allowing them to handle retrieved information more effectively. Although both paradigms have their merits, they are not well-aligned with human preferences, making it challenging for RALMs to distinguish between high-quality responses and suboptimal ones. To this end, some works (Nakano et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b; Huang et al., 2024b; Song et al., 2024) adopt RLHF or DPO to optimize RALMs, enabling them to generate higher-quality citations that align with human preferences. However, these works focus solely on citation quality to provide reward signals, without offering comprehensive reward model for RAG. As the diversity of reward models continues to expand, growing number of benchmarks are emerging to address the need for standardized evaluation. RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024b) is the first comprehensive framework for assessing RMs in chat, reasoning, and safety domains. Given tuple (x, yc, yr), where is the prompt, yc is the chosen response, and yr is the rejected response, the reward model predicts whether yc is better than yr. Following this work, M-RewardBench (Gureja et al., 2024) extends the evaluation to multilingual scenarios. Furthermore, RMB (Zhou et al., 2024) broadens the evaluation scope by including 49 realworld scenarios. RM-Bench (Liu et al., 2024b) is designed to evaluate RMs based on their sensitivity to subtle content differences and style biases. VL-RewardBench (Li et al., 2024c) provides dataset to evaluate the vision-language generative RMs. These works contribute to the advancement of benchmarking RMs. However, notable gap remains in the development of benchmark specifically tailored for RMs in the RAG scenarios."

            "content": "Building on previous works (Lambert et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), we first evaluate preferences in the RAG setting from two general aspects: helpfulness and harmlessness. For helpfulness subset, human preferences lean towards responses that, faithful to the retrieved documents, provide useful, relevant, and accurate information, offering clear answer that effectively addresses the users query. Considering the diverse user requirements in real-world applications, we sample queries from the following seven RAG datasets: NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) (i.e., open-domain QA), SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024) (i.e., opendomain QA), ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022) (i.e., long-form QA), BioASQ (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) (i.e., biomedical QA), FreshQA (Vu et al., 2024) (i.e., time-sensitive QA), ExpertQA (Malaviya et al., 2023) (i.e., domain-specific QA), MultiFieldQA (Bai et al., 2024) (i.e., long-context QA). For harmlessness subset, human values require that the responses generated by RALMs should not contain harmful or biased information from the retrieved documents. Due to the susceptibility of knowledge databases in RAG systems to poisoning attacks (Zou et al., 2024; Xiang et al., 2024), which can cause RALMs to generate malicious responses. We sample harmful queries from XStest (Röttger et al., 2024) to assess the safety ability of RMs in RAG settings. Furthermore, existing research (Huang et al., 2023b; Qi et al., 2024) highlights that when knowledge databases contain sensitive information, RAG systems are prone to leaking private data under carefully crafted prompts. Following Zeng et al. (2024), we construct Privacy dataset to evaluate RMs in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Beyond the basic helpfulness and harmlessness, we propose four challenging RAG-specific scenarios to evaluate reward models as follows: (1) Multi-hop Reasoning: Recent work (Tang and Yang, 2024) reveals that existing RAG systems are inadequate at answering multi-hop queries, which require reasoning over evidence from multiple documents. To enhance RALMs ability to handle multi-hop queries, the reward model should be capable of identifying logical errors and inconsistent reasoning paths in responses. We construct the multi-hop reasoning subset based on HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), and MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024). (2) Fine-grained Citation: RALMs should be able to ground the generated responses to the reliable sources, allowing users to verify the claims Figure 3: The source model distribution. through the provided citations easily (Nakano et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2023). However, current evaluation methods focus on coarse attributions, typically citing entire documents or paragraphs (Slobodkin et al., 2024). good reward model should be able to capture errors in fine-grained, sentence-level citations within the responses, such as over-citations or missing citations. We construct the fine-grained citation subset based on ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019), ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022), RobustQA-Science and RobustQA-Technology (Han et al., 2023). (3) Appropriate Abstain: For RALMs, when the retrieved content does not contain enough information to answer the question, the model should abstain from providing an answer rather than generating an incorrect response (Chen et al., 2024; Joren et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). The reward model should be capable of identifying situations where the model should abstain from answering. We construct the appropriate abstain subset based on NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023) and CRAG (Yang et al., 2024c), selecting queries where the context does not contain sufficient information to answer the question. (4) Conflict Robustness: Given the prevalence of misleading and outdated information, RALMs often struggle with conflicting knowledge (Xie et al., 2024). The reward model should robustly distinguish between correct responses and those misled by inaccurate information. Following Jin et al. (2024a,b), we use GPT-4o-2024-08-06 to synthesize counterfactual documents for constructing the conflict robustness subset based on NQ, TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and PopQA. 5 Figure 4: The Pearson correlation coefficient between different judgment models.

            "content": "To increase the diversity of data sources, we sample multiple real-world queries from 18 subsets mentioned above across different domains. The subset distribution is shown in Figure 7. To avoid biases introduced by single retriever, we use five open-source retrievers, including BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009), DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020), E5 (Wang et al., 2022), BGE (Xiao et al., 2023), and GTR (Ni et al., 2022). To obtain more realistic retrieval results, we also use Google Search 1 with the entire web as the retrieval corpus. As shown in Figure 9, the length of the retrieval results varies. After collecting the queries and their retrieval results, we input them together as prompts into RALMs. Table 5 shows the generation prompt for RALMs. We adopt 24 popular RALMs to generate responses, ranging from open-source models (3B to 70B) to commercial models (e.g., o1-mini, GPT4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude 3.5 and Command R), with the different distribution shown in Figure 3. 3.3 Judgment of High-Quality Preferences Different from RewardBench, which has an average prompt length of 47, RALMs require incorporating much larger number of retrieved results into the prompt shown in Figure 9.

LLM-as-a-judge (Li et al., 2024a; Son et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024) is widely used approach in preference data construction (Zheng et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024) and automatic RAG evaluation (SaadFalcon et al., 2024; ES et al., 2024). In detail, we select 4 state-of-the-art commercial models as judges, including gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, claude-3-5-haiku and gemini-1.5-flash. In the case of fine-grained citation evaluation, we ask them to score responses on five-point scale across five dimensions: response clarity, response accuracy, citation appropriateness, citation correctness, and citation granularity, with detailed guidelines. For each prompt, we calculate the consistency of scores across all responses given by the evaluation models. Prompts with low consistency are filtered out. As shown in Figure 4, the final Pearson correlation coefficient between evaluation models is 0.79. Hence, we compute the average score across the different evaluation models as the final score for that response. To ensure controlled difficulty in our dataset, we select response pairs with score difference between 1 and 2 as the chosen-rejected pairs, enabling better evaluation of RMs. Ultimately, we can obtain 1,485 high-quality preference pairs.

For discriminative RMs ( ), we select large number of models that perform well on RewardBench, such as Skywork-Reward-Gemma-2-27B-v0.2 (Liu et al., 2024a), Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward (Wang et al., 2024e), URM-LLaMa-3.1-8B (Lou et al., 2024), and InternLM2-20B-Reward (Cai ), we consider et al., 2024).

For implicit RMs ( ), we adopt Llama-3.1-Tülu-3-8B (Lambert et al., 2024a), Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2024), and other policy models to compute the response probabilities. Given tuple (x, yc, yr), where is the prompt, yc is the chosen response, and yr is the rejected response, the RM needs to predict whether yc is better than yr. Following RewardBench, we use accuracy as the evaluation metric, where the accuracy of random guessing is 50%. We notice positional bias in generative RMs, so we swap the positions of yc and yr, run the evaluation twice, and report the average accuracy. The evaluation prompt for generative RMs is available in Table 6."

            "content": "Table 2 shows the evaluation results of 45 reward models in RAG-RewardBench. We rank the reward models by their average scores across all subsets. We can find the following conclusions: (1) RAGRewardBench is highly challenging for existing reward models, even though they have achieved very high performance (over 90% accuracy) in general scenarios. In RAG-RewardBench, the bestperforming model, Skywork-Critic-Llama-3.1-70B (Shiwen et al., 2024), achieves only 78.3% accuracy, while powerful LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and Gemini-1.5-Pro perform at around 60% to 70%. (2) In the four RAG-specific scenarios we designed, the RMs performance decreases to varying extents. For example, in the fine-grained citation subset, the accuracy drops by an average of 10% compared to the helpfulness subset. This indicates that existing RMs have difficulty capturing subtle errors in in-line citations within responses, highlighting the need for specialized RMs tailored specifically for RALMs. (3) The RMs in the top 10 are generally generative or discriminative models trained with 27B or 70B parameters. We believe that using generative models for reward modeling in RAG tasks holds significant promise, especially as we observe that Self-taught-Evaluator-Llama3.170B can autonomously generate evaluation metrics that are well-suited to the characteristics of RAG."

Figure 6: The correlation between the RMs performance on RAG-RewardBench and the improvement it achieves for RAG tasks through Best-of-N sampling. gate this issue, we select several trained RALMs, including SelfRAG (Asai et al., 2024a), RetRobust (Yoran et al., 2024), FgCite (Huang et al., 2024a), ChatQA (Liu et al., 2024c), and AutoRAG (Yu et al., 2024a), and evaluate them on RAGRewardBench by employing the same approach used for implicit RMs. Specifically, we compare the conditional probabilities of these models for the chosen and rejected responses. As shown in Table 3, despite achieving significant improvements on various RAG datasets, these models show only marginal gains compared to the base models on RAG-RewardBench. Notably, in the harmlessness subset, these models exhibit poor alignment, which could hinder the practical application of RAG. This highlights that the RALM training paradigm needs to shift towards preference-aligned RAG training. RAG-RewardBench can also serve as suite for evaluating the alignment capabilities of RALMs. Difficulty Control of Preference Pairs. In the construction of preference pairs, we can control the difficulty of RM evaluation by adjusting the score difference between chosen and rejected responses. Therefore, we investigate the impact of varying the chosen-rejected score gap in RAG-RewardBench on the performance of reward models. As shown in Figures 5 and 11, as the score gap increases, it becomes easier for both discriminative and implicit reward models to distinguish between positive and negative responses. This indicates that our benchmark construction is reliable and its difficulty level can be flexibly adjusted. Correlation with Downstream Tasks. good benchmark for evaluating RMs should faithfully reflect their effectiveness in the downstream alignment task (Liu et al., 2024b). Following previous work (Zhou et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c), we investigate the Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, where the reward model is used to select the best response from multiple candidate options, with the goal of improving the quality of the models responses. We conduct experiments with two LLMs of significantly different sizes: Llama-3.2-3B and Llama-3.1-70B (Dubey et al., 2024). We sample 200 queries respectively from the dev/test sets of HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022). For each query, we generate = 32 candidate responses and employ seven reward models to execute BoN sampling. Considering that LLMs tend to generate longer responses, we use recall to measure the accuracy of the answers (Adlakha et al., 2024). As illustrated in Figures 6 and 12, there is strong 8 correlation between the RMs performance on the multi-hop reasoning subset and the improvement it brings to RAG tasks through BoN sampling, with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.80."

To increase the data source diversity, we adopt 18 datasets, six retrievers and 24 RALMs. We conduct experiments with 45 RMs, revealing the limitations of existing RMs on RAG-RewardBench. We find that current RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for shift towards preference-aligned training. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work."

Although our benchmark effectively highlights the performance gaps in current reward models, we acknowledge that developing reward model specifically tailored for RAG remains an open challenge. In future work, we plan to design specialized generative reward model capable of better understanding long-context inputs and enhancing the alignment of RAG models with human preferences. This model will aim to address the unique requirements of RAG tasks, such as handling multi-document reasoning, fine-grained attribution, and contextual faithfulness. Additionally, providing process-level or fine-grained reward signals for RAG is promising research direction."
