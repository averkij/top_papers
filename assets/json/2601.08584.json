            "content": "In this work, we introduce Ministral 3, family of dense models trained in computeand data-efficient manner through iterative shrinking and distillation from parent pretrained model. Unlike popular pretrained models such as Qwen3 [Yang et al., 2025] or Llama3 [Dubey et al., 2024] that are trained on 36 trillion and 15 trillion tokens respectively, we are able to produce competitive models trained for between 1 and 3 trillion tokens by leveraging Mistral Small 3.1, strong 24B-parameter parent model. Available in three sizes: 3B, 8B, and 14B parameters, all Ministral 3 models are descendants of Mistral Small 3.11, obtained via Cascade Distillation approach. We present three variants for each model size: base, instruct, and reasoning, each with image understanding capabilities and context lengths up to 256k tokens (128k for reasoning models). key component of Ministral 3 is our Cascade Distillation training strategy, an iterative pruning and distillation method, which progressively transfers pretrained knowledge from large parent model down to family of compact children models. Our recipe allows us to achieve performance that is competitive with models which had much larger training budget. For example, the Ministral 3 14B Base model closely matches Mistral Small 3.1 Base, while being more than 40% smaller and trained on much shorter horizon. After post-training, we achieve competitive results with similarly sized open weight models such as Gemma 3 [Kamath et al., 2025], Qwen 3 [Yang et al., 2025, Bai et al., 2025], and Mistral Small 3.2 2506. 1https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3-1 Figure 1: Overview of Ministral 3 training recipe. Pretraining: We start from pruning the parent model, Mistral Small 3.1, into the largest child model (14B Init.). Next, we continue pretraining the child model with logit distillation from the parent model as the teacher to obtain the up-trained short context child model (14B Short Ctx.). From 14B Short Ctx., we perform another round of distillation with longer context window (see 3.1 for details) to obtain the final Ministral 3 14B Base model. In parallel, 14B Short Ctx. is pruned to initialize the next child model (8B Init.), from which we repeat the process to derive Ministral 3 8B Base model. We repeat the same process for the 3B version. Post-training: Each Base model is then post-trained into the instruction-following and reasoning variants. For instruction-following, our post-training recipe includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Online Direct Preference Optimization (ODPO). For reasoning, the process involved supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data (SFT w/ CoT), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO; Shao et al. [2024]), and ODPO. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce Ministral 3, family of 9 dense language models - pretrained, an instruction finetuned, and reasoning model, each at the 14B, 8B, and 3B parameter scales. All Ministral 3 models (3 sizes 3 variants) are open-weight under the Apache 2.0 license. We present compute-efficient pretraining recipe, Cascade Distillation, with which these models have been pretrained at fraction of the cost it would take to pretrain from scratch. We independently confirm findings from prior work that (a) there exists \"capacity gap\" where stronger teacher does not yield stronger student model for pretraining, but posttraining continues to benefit from stronger teachers (b) distilling from post-trained as opposed to pretrained teacher when pretraining the student model results in better benchmark scores (c) distilling from human preference optimized teacher is better than one that has only been post-trained with SFT."

All models share common architectural foundation with size-specific scaling. As shown in Table 1, the family consists of three sizes: 3B, 8B, and 14B parameters, with 26, 34, and 40 layers 2 respectively. Other architectural choices include Grouped Query Attention [Ainslie et al., 2023] with 32 query heads and 8 key-value heads, RoPE [Su et al., 2021] positional embeddings, SwiGLU activation [Shazeer, 2020], and RMSNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019]. For long-context extension, we use YaRN [Peng et al., 2023] and position-based softmax temperature scaling in the attention layer [Nakanishi, 2025, MetaAI, 2025]. The 3B model uses tied input-output embeddings to avoid embedding parameters dominating the overall parameter count. All models use vocabulary of 131K tokens and support context lengths up to 256K tokens. Vision encoder. All Ministral 3 models use 410M parameter ViT as vision encoder for image understanding that is copied from Mistral Small 3.1 Base and kept frozen, with the same architecture described in Pixtral [Agrawal et al., 2024]. We discard the pretrained projection layer from the ViT to language models space and train new projection for every model."

Cascade Distillation. Pretraining of the Ministral 3 models starts from the Mistral Small 3.1 Base (MS3.1) model. We use Cascade Distillation, an iterative approach to prune and distill MS3.1 into the smaller successors. Cascade Distillation is compute-efficient process for pretraining children models of decreasing target sizes, given pre-trained larger parent model. As summarized in Algorithm 1, it relies on an iterative prune-distill-repeat approach: 1. Prune: initialize the weights of child model via pruning larger pre-trained model. 2. Distill: up-train the freshly pruned model via distillation from the teacher models logits. 3. Repeat: apply this strategy repeatedly to shrink the child model into something even smaller. Model pruning at each stage follows similar approach to Minitron and Wanda [Sun et al., 2023, Sreenivas et al., 2024, Muralidharan et al., 2024] with the distillation teacher being Mistral Small 3.1 for all variants. Details of pruning and distillation are provided in the following paragraphs. Compared to training each small model from scratch, Cascade Distillation produces model that is significantly more FLOP efficient. It is also worth noting that the end-to-end process can be viewed as form of continual pretraining of the parent model with weight pruning. As illustrated in Figure 2, data repetition is avoided throughout the process as Cascade Distillation goes through the data mix in single run with pruning en route. Pruning. Similar to Minitron, our pruning strategies are designed to preserve the most critical components of the original model (over validation dataset) while reducing its size. We employ following key pruning techniques: Layer Pruning: Unlike Sreenivas et al. [2024], which relies on counterfactual downstream perplexities from removing individual layers, we find that the ratio of input to output activation norms provides simpler yet strong proxy for layer importance. Hidden Dimension Pruning: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to concatenated activations from attention normalization and feed-forward normalization layers across all layers. This yields single rotation matrix consistent across the entire network that projects the model to lower-dimensional space while maximizing explained variance. Feedforward Dimension Pruning: For MLPs with gated-linear activation functions such as SwiGLU [Shazeer, 2020], expressed as W2(SiLU (W1x) W3x) given very large batch x, we prune dimension of the matrices W1, W2, W3. To determine the columns of W1, W3 to keep, we compute the importance score defined as the averaged absolute value of each dim of the expression above. We then keep only the corresponding rows of W2 with the indices yielded above. Algorithm 2 provides more detail on our pruning strategy: Algorithm 2 Pruning stage of Cascade Distillation. It takes as input pre-trained model and target size configuration to prune to. We use input_x and output_x to refer to activations from large calibration batch. target_n_layers , target_dim , target_ffn_dim = get_config ( target_size ) input_norm = layer . input_x . norm ( dim = - 1 ) output_norm = layer . output_x . norm ( dim = - 1 ) scores . append ( ( output_norm / input_norm ) . mean () layers_to_keep = topk ( scores , = target_n_layers ) model = remove_layers ( model , layers_to_keep ) layer . attn_norm . input_x , layer . ffn_norm . input_x , rotation = PCA ( norm_inputs , n_components = n_dims ) model = apply_rotation ( model , rotation , target_dim ) ) # layer pruning scores = [ ] for layer in model . layers : # hidden dimension pruning norm_inputs = [ ] for layer in model . layers : 1 def prune ( model , target_size ) : 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # feedforward pruning for layer in model . layers : importance = abs ( norm_inputs . extend ( [ return model ] ) silu ( layer . ffn . w1 . output_x ) * layer . ffn . w3 . output_x ) . mean ( dim = (0 , 1 ) ) dims_to_keep = topk ( importance , = target_ffn_dim ) layer . ffn = run e_h idd en_ di ms ( layer . ffn , dims_to_keep ) Distillation. After weight initialization, each child model is trained on mixture of text-only and interleaved text with image data with logit distillation from teacher model. We find that training with just the forward KL distillation objective outperforms tuning the coefficients of an objective that weights the distillation objective and the next token prediction objective differently. For all stages and model sizes, we use the parent model as the teacher model(more details in 5.1). The pretraining phase consists of two-stages: (1) Short context stage with context window of length 16,384. The output of this phase is the input to to the pruning phase of the next child model. 4 (2) Long context stage to extend the context window from 16,384 to 262,144 using YaRN [Peng et al., 2023] and position-based temperature scaling [Nakanishi, 2025, MetaAI, 2025]. 3.2 Post-Training: Ministral Instruct To impart instruction-following capabilities [Ouyang et al., 2022], pretrained models are fine-tuned using curated dataset comprising high-quality multimodal and text-only instruction-following data. The fine-tuning phase also consists of two stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Online Direct Preference Optimization (ODPO). 3.2.1 Supervised Fine-tuning We run SFT with fp8 quantization, using logit distillation loss from strong teacher. Unlike pretraining, each model is distilled from Mistral Medium 3 model (more details in 5.1). Similar to the pretraining phase, the vision encoder remains frozen while the adapter is trainable. 3.2.2 Online Direct Preference Optimization stage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [Rafailov et al., 2023] offers lightweight framework for human preference optimization by learning directly from offline pairwise preferences. For the Ministral 3 models, we adopt its online variant, Online Direct Preference Optimization (ODPO) [Guo et al., 2024] where, for each example, we sample two candidate responses from the current policy with temperature =0.7, and use text-based reward model to rank the responses. This method relies on Pairwise Reward Model (PWRM) to dynamically rank candidate responses. The PWRM is trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on structured pairwise data: given conversation history and two candidate responses, it predicts which response is preferred. In addition, we refine the classic DPO loss by incorporating the binomial probabilistic output of the PWRM, replacing hard winner/loser labels with two-sided loss that weights each response by its probability of being preferred. We make two additional changes to stabilize the learning process: (1) we adjust the PWRM temperature to calibrate the win / loss probabilities; and (2) we employ β-rescaling technique, allowing for more beta-invariant rescaling of dpo loss. In practice, the online variant is particularly important for mitigating model-induced artifacts, such as infinite generations. This is also facilitated by some heuristics, such as automatically treating any response that exhibits an infinite loop during sample as loser, preventing such behavior from being reinforced. Finally, we enable tool execution during generation, which improves the models tool-use performance. In summary, we found that using online preference optimization improves alignment with human preferences significantly over both the SFT and offline variants. We release the models resulting from this phase as Ministral 3-14B/8B/3B Instruct. 3.3 Post-Training: Ministral Reasoning Post-training for reasoning models begins from the pre-trained checkpoint as opposed to the ODPO variant. We train the model for inference-time scaling using three-stage pipeline composed of SFT, GRPO and ODPO, using the long-context pretrained checkpoint as the starting point. Models released after this reasoning-oriented fine-tuning stage are referred to as Ministral 3 14B/8B/3B Reasoning. 3.3.1 Reasoning Supervised Fine-Tuning In this stage, the model is finetuned on mixture of short and long CoT samples. The former is derived from our general SFT data mixture whereas the latter consists of reasoning traces which have been prefixed with reasoning specific system prompt. The reasoning traces come from diverse set of domains including mathematics, coding, general dialogue, instruction following, multilingual tasks, tool use, and visual reasoning. We apply lightweight filtering to remove examples that are poorly formatted, contain excessive repetition, or have undesirable language switching, ensuring that the model is exposed to clean and well-structured chains of thought. 5 3B SFT: For the 3B model, vanilla SFT led to brittle, overly verbose model with lots of repetition and infinite generations in its output. To mitigate this, we did logit distillation with Magistral Small 1.2 as teacher. This helped reduce verbosity and stabilized subsequent RL training. 3.3.2 Reinforcement Learning We perform GRPO [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025] on top of the SFT checkpoint to refine the models thinking and improve the performance further on reasoning tasks. The training is conducted in two stages: STEM RL: In the first stage, we train the model on math, code and visual-reasoning tasks. We collect question-answer pairs from diverse set of open and proprietary sources. The samples are filtered and cleaned using rigorous multi-step pipeline (detailed in Rastogi et al. [2025]) to remove invalid, incomplete and very easy/hard problems. General RL: In the second stage, we broaden the scope beyond STEM problems. We generate atomic grading rubrics for diverse set of prompts including general chat, instruction-following, and open-ended reasoning tasks. During GRPO, an LLM judge evaluates each model rollout against these rubrics (e.g., faithfulness to the prompt, response quality) and the final reward is set to the fraction of satisfied heuristics. This stage improves the instruction following and general chat capabilities of the model while maintaining, and sometimes even improving, the performance on the STEM benchmarks. For both stages, we follow the GRPO training recipe from Rastogi et al. [2025].The maximum generation length is increased from 32K to 80K, since we observed non-trivial proportion of truncated generations during RL. Allowing longer outputs allowed the model to finish its reasoning for the most challenging problems, resulting in additional performance gains. 3.3.3 Online Direct Preference Optimization Finally, we apply ODPO as post-RL alignment stage to better align with user preferences and polish the models conversational and instructional behavior. The overall procedure follows the same setup as used for our non-reasoning instruct models, with one modification The thinking chunks are stripped from the models generations before sending them to the reward model for scoring. Some additional experimental details are discussed in Section 5.3."

            "content": "5.1 Choice of Teacher Model for Distillation Figure 3: Ministral 3 14B pretraining ablations comparing distillation from Mistral Small 3.1 and Mistral Medium 3 teachers. Despite Mistral Medium 3 being larger and more capable, distillation from Mistral Small 3.1 consistently yields stronger downstream performance across different benchmarks. In selecting an appropriate teacher model for the distillation process, we identified several noteworthy observations that meaningfully influenced our design choices: 8 Stronger teacher does not lead to better results: For pretraining, distilling from Mistral Small 3.1 outperformed distillation from the much stronger Mistral Medium 3 3 even in non FLOP-matched setup, similar to observations in Busbridge et al. [2025] (Figure 3). However, during post-training, Ministral 3 models benefit from distillation from the more capable Mistral Medium 3.1. Figure 4: Ministral 3 3B pretraining ablations comparing distillation from base and post-trained (instruct/reasoning) variants of Mistral Small 3.1. The instruct teacher yields stronger performance on STEM benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on knowledge and multimodal evaluations.. The choice of teacher version (base / instruct ) matters: In line with Goyal et al. [2025], we find that distilling from post-trained teacher as opposed to pre-trained one during the pre-training stage results in stronger model (Figure 4). In particular, this had strong impact on maths (MATH) and code capabilities, small but consistent impact on multimodal evaluations (e.g. MMMU), and negligible impact on knowledge metrics (MMLU / Trivia-QA). Human Preference tuned models are better teachers: Post We use two internal versions of Mistral Medium 3 to answer the question - is it better to distill from an SFT or preference tuned checkpoint during SFT? We find that distilling from the preference tuned checkpoint is always substantially better. These gains persist even after the student model undergoes its own preference tuning phase. 5.2 Model Verbosity. Figure 5: Verbosity (in terms of number of output tokens) v.s. accuracy on GPQA Diamond with Ministral 3 instruction-following and reasoning. Our post-training of Ministral 3 Instruct differs from Qwen 3 in that it does not do \"Reasoning RL\" before the \"General RL\" stage (see Fig. 1 of Yang et al. [2025]) this likely results in different model verbosity between the two models as illustrated in Figure 5. 3https://docs.mistral.ai/models/mistral-medium-3-1-259 In an experiment to try and get the Ministral 3 Instruct models to produce longer chains of thought, we investigated incorporating varying proportions of long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces, paired with carefully curated system prompts, into the SFT training data. Increasing the fraction of such Long CoT data improved the performance on STEM benchmarks; however, it also leads to excessive reflection, internal monologues and backtracking behavior (as shown below), which is undesirable and unnatural for general-purpose chat model. Reasoning Behavior in Instruct Model Okay, lets try to solve this problem step by step. The question is: Find the sum of all integer bases > 9 for which 17b is divisor of 97b. First, need to recall how to convert numbers from base to base 10. number dndn1 . . . d1d0 in base is equal to dnbn + dn1bn1 + + d1b + d0 in base 10. . . . Wait, the problem states > 9, so we need to check the divisors of 56 that are greater than 9 (since = 7 . . . Wait, but lets check another way. Instead of using the congruence, we can set up the equation 9b + 7 = k(b + 7) for some integer 1 . . . think thats it. The key was to convert the numbers to base 10, set up the divisibility condition, and recognize that the base must be greater than 9, so we only consider divisors of 56 that make > 9. . . . Thus, the valid bases are 21 and 49. The sum of these bases is: Therefore, the answer is 70 . 21 + 49 = 5.3 ODPO for Ministral 3 Reasoning. Figure 6: Impact of ODPO on chat benchmarks for Ministral 3 reasoning models, applied on top of GRPOtrained checkpoints. ODPO delivers substantial gains across all benchmarks for the 14B and 8B variants. Reasoning models, while being better at solving challenging problems, often lag in general conversational quality, pattern we also observed with the Ministral 3 reasoning variants. To address this, we performed ODPO training on top of the RL-trained checkpoints. As shown in Figure 6, this significantly improved the 14B and 8B models on alignment benchmarks. The 3B model however, did not demonstrate significant improvements on public benchmarks after this stage4. The model nevertheless performed better in our internal human evaluations and so we selected the ODPO checkpoint as the release candidate. 4We also found the 3B base more sensitive than 14B and 8B to hyper-parameter choice in fine-tuning"

            "content": "We introduced Ministral 3, family of efficient dense language models designed for resourceconstrained environments. Through iterative distillation from larger teacher models (Mistral Small 3.1 and Medium 3), we created three model sizes (14B, 8B, 3B) each available in base, instructionfollowing, and reasoning-enhanced variants. All models support vision capabilities and handle contexts up to 256K tokens. Collectively, Ministral 3 models highlight Mistrals continued commitment to supporting and advancing open-source initiatives. We hope they will provide value to the community and contribute to stronger, more vibrant open-source ecosystem. Core contributors Alexander H.
