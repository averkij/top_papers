            "content": "Ensuring the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains critical challenge in real-world deployments [35]. In practice, models may face wide variety of jailbreaking prompts, many of which differ substantially from previously seen attack patterns. The diversity and continual evolution of deployment environments make out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization central issue for safety alignment [17, 51, 53]. To tackle this, prior work has explored multiple strategies, including modifying training objectives [38, 60, 68], altering internal representations [44], and activating latent safety knowledge through explicit reasoning [17, 26, 51, 63]. While prior safety alignment efforts offer valuable insights, most aligned models are trained on fixed sets of known attack types and remain static after deployment, leaving them vulnerable to unseen jailbreaks. For instance, the robust GPT-4-1106 [36] model released in November 2023 was later compromised by CodeAttack [39] in March 2024. This highlights the need for lifelong alignment against ever-evolving, unseen attacks [57]. To this end, we pose the following research question: Can we develop framework that efficiently generates evolving attacks against strong defense models and provides continual data for improving safety alignment? We identify several key insights from recent safety alignment research that help frame this question. First, diverse range of known attacks [5, 39, 43, 67] already exists and can be used to warm-start attacker models. Lifelong attack methods such as AutoDAN-Turbo [30] and AutoRT [31] can continuously generate viable jailbreaks against static, safety-aligned models. Meanwhile, existing defense techniques, such as refusal training [38] and Circuit Breakers (i.e., the RR models) [68], demonstrate strong robustness on trained attack types and some generalization to unseen ones. Correspondence to Tianyu Pang. Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: Evolution of successful jailbreak strategies across iterations in our lifelong safety alignment framework. Left: Strategies that succeed against the initial model M0. Right: Strategies that succeed against the updated Defender M1. Notably, the dominant strategy category Fictional Scenarios & Role-Playing drops from the majority to under 5% in the second iteration, indicating that M1 effectively defends against these attacks through adversarial-play evolution. However, current lifelong attack frameworks primarily evaluate standard models such as LLaMA and GPT variants [36, 47], leaving it unclear whether these attacks can successfully jailbreak the most robust models like RR [68] or LAT [44], due to lack of empirical evaluations [30, 31]. Moreover, these safety-aligned models were not explicitly trained against lifelong attacks, so their robustness under continual adversarial pressure remains uncertain. Finally, existing lifelong attack frameworks assume both attackers and defenders are static [30, 31], limiting their ability to simulate competitive, evolving dynamic. Once attackers learn to reliably jailbreak fixed model, they have little incentive to explore new strategieshindering the discovery of ever-evolving attacks. To address these challenges, we propose lifelong safety alignment framework that can automatically and efficiently discover new jailbreaks from existing (seen) attacks and continuously adapt to defend against them. We formulate this as competitive setup between Meta-Attacker and Defender, aiming to extract both existing attacks and anticipate previously unseen ones, thereby advancing paradigm of adversarial-play evolution. Our framework consists of two stages: (1) Warm-Up Stage, where we use the GPT-4o API to extract attack strategies from existing jailbreak papers and initialize the Meta-Attacker; and (2) Lifelong Safety Alignment Stage, where the Meta-Attacker and Defender engage in an adversarial-play evolution loopattacking and defending iterativelyleading to progressively stronger models on both sides as illustrated in Figure 2. After the first iteration, the Meta-Attacker achieves 73% attack success rate (ASR) against RR [68] and 57% transfer ASR against LAT [44], using single-turn jailbreak prompts. In the second iteration, it further discovers novel strategies such as Series of Indirect & Technical Framing\", closely resembling the most advanced multi-turn jailbreak techniques [46], as illustrated in Table 2. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of attack categories, emphasizing how each category has transformed over iterations. Concurrently, the Defender achieves stronger alignment performances on the test set of seen attacks and exhibits improved resistance to previously unseen ones."

            "content": "In this section, we propose lifelong safety alignment framework to defend against both seen and unseen jailbreak attacks through the adversarial-play evolution between Meta-Attacker and Defender. Our design is inspired by the workflow of red-teaming researchers, who typically begin by reviewing prior jailbreak-related studies (a warm-up phase), followed by iterative reasoning and trial-and-error to refine their attack strategies. Similarly, our Meta-Attackerinitialized as A0 with DeepSeek-R1 [18] and warmed up using key insights extracted from existing jailbreak papers via the GPT-4o APIserves as an automated red-teaming researcher, systematically exploring and evolving jailbreak strategies in response to the Defenders adaptations. For the initial Defender M0, we adopt RR [68], one of the most advanced safety-aligned models. As illustrated in Figure 2, we formulate 2 Figure 2: Lifelong safety alignment framework. In the Warm-Up Stage (Step 1), powerful LLM Mapi (e.g., GPT-4o) is used to analyze jailbreak-related research papers and open-source codes. Key strategies are extracted and used by the initial Meta-Attacker A0 to generate jailbreak questions targeting specific goals g. These are submitted to the target model M0, producing responses y, and forming tuples (s, x, y, g) that are categorized into success buffer Bs or failure buffer Bf . In the Lifelong Safety Alignment Stage (Steps 24), the Meta-Attacker and Defender co-evolve through iterative interaction. The Meta-Attacker learns from failed cases in Bf and generates new attack strategies and questions, which are again evaluated against M0. safeguard model Mj assesses the responses and updates the buffers Bs and Bf accordingly. Successful tuples in Bs are used to further evolve the Meta-Attacker via beam search [14] and Reject Fine-Tuning [13, 61], forming an iterative Adversarial-Play Evolution Loop. This loop continues until one of two conditions is met: (1) the goal success rate exceeds threshold K, or (2) the maximum number of iterations is reached. At the end of each loop, the Defender M0 is updated through refusal training using successful attack cases in Bs and refusal outputs from the refusal model Mr. this adversarial-play evolution as competitive co-evolutionary process between the Meta-Attacker and the Defender, further detailed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. For clarity and ease of reference, all key notations used in this paper are summarized in Table 9."

            "content": "In this section, we introduce an efficient method for systematically extracting attack strategies from existing jailbreak-related research papers to support the warm-up process. This stage consists of three key components described as follows. 3 Algorithm 1 Lifelong Safety Alignment Input: Iteration Times , Goal Pool G, Meta-Attacker A0, Defender M0, Safeguard Mj, Refusal Generator Mr, Maximum Interaction Times , Threshold of Successful Goals Percentage K, Successful Buffer Bs, Failed Buffer Bf , Adversarial-Play Evolution of Meta-Attacker process F1, Adversarial-Play Evolution of Defender process F2. for = 0 to 1 do At+1 = F1(g, At, Mt, Mj, Bf , Bs, K, ) Mt+1 = F2(M0, Mr, Bs, D) end for Extracting Strategies by API Models. We utilize the GPT-4o API [36] as Mapi, to process the jailbreak-related research papers (PDF format) and source codes (if any). We analyze 10 representative jailbreak-related research papers. Although GPT-4o has undergone extensive safety alignment and it inherently resists directly processing such sensitive tasks, we surprisingly find its quite easy to circumvent this limitation by simply framing the system prompt for research or educational purposes. Through reject sampling, we filter out refusals and retain only valid outputs, allowing us to extract actionable jailbreak strategies, denoted as = Mapi(P ) from the papers and their codes. More details about extraction prompt on GPT-4o and extracted strategies are shown in Section 3.1 and Appendix D. Utilizing Extracted Strategies for Concrete Jailbreak Questions. After extracting strategies s, we prompt strong Meta-Attacker model A0 to apply these strategies on several goals g. Specifically, we adopt DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B [56, 18] as A0 due to its remarkable ability in instruction following and reasoning, as well as it hasnt undergone much safety alignment [26]. This process results in set of concrete jailbreak questions, denoted as = A0(s, g). Warming Up Buffers. We adopt one of the strongest defender models: RR [68] as Defender M0. After gathering jailbreak questions x, we pass them into M0, and the safety of its responses is assessed by separate model Mj. We primarily use LLaMA-Guard-3-8B as Mj. However, due to the unreadable tokens and model bias influence on the judge results, we additionally include another larger LLM: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct [56] as safety judge to correct the mistakes induced by those unreadable tokens or model bias. This model serves as proxy for human evaluation. The successful jailbreak tuples (s, x, y, g) are stored in buffer Bs, while the failed tuples are stored in buffer Bf . This effectively warms up the two buffers for subsequent lifelong safety alignment stage."

            "content": "In the previous section, we introduce an efficient method to extract existing jailbreak strategies to warm up the successful buffer Bs and the failed buffer Bf . With these two buffers, the MetaAttacker A0 will engage in Adversarial-Play Evolution against the frozen Defender M0. This is accomplished through combination of beam search and Reject Fine-Tuning, progressively evolving the Meta-Attacker to A1 (A0, 0 , A1). Subsequently, the Defender M0 will also engage in Adversarial-Play Evolution against the frozen Meta-Attacker A1 by refusal training with Bs and corresponding Refusals. The completion of the Defenders update marks the end of one iteration. The updated Meta-Attacker and Defender will serve as the initial checkpoints of next iteration. We divide this Lifelong Safety Alignment Stage into three key components: (1) Adversarial-Play Evolution of Meta-Attacker. (2) Adversarial-Play Evolution of Defender. (3) Lifelong Iterations. 0, Adversarial-Play Evolution of Meta-Attacker. We formulate the Adversarial-Play Evolution of Meta-Attacker as process F1: At+1 = F1(g, At, Mt, Mj, Bf , Bs, K, ) We explain the process F1 as shown in step 2 of Figure 2 and in the following details: Step 1: We begin by prompting At to carefully analyze the reasons why the tuples (s, x, y, g) in Bf failed to jailbreak Mt. Then we ask it to either revise the failed strategies or propose new one targeting the same goal , along with new jailbreak question ), we conduct Best-of-N sampling (N = 8) on At, using . To efficiently propose (s , 4 resulting in 8 distinct strategies and jailbreak questions (s each g. 1, 1), (s 2, 2), ..., (s 8, 8) on Step 2: We separately attack Mt with these 8 new jailbreak questions , yielding 8 responses = Mt(x ) for each g. Step 3: We leverage safeguard Mj to assess the safety of . We employ the most advanced safeguard: LLaMA-Guard-3-8B as Mj, along with LLM: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as safety judge to correct some slight mistakes and bias. Here Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct ) pairs. This results serves as proxy for human evaluation due to the huge number of (g, in judges oi = Mj(g, i, g) i, i, g) will be used to enrich will be stored in Bs, while the remaining failed tuples (s the original failure tuples (s, x, y, g) to form growing tuple (s + i, g) and collected in Bf to help At accumulate failure experience and evolve via beam search in future iterations. An example of this growing tuple (s + i, g) in Bf is shown in Appendix D. i) (i=1,..,8). The successful (oi == unsafe) tuples (s i, + i, + i, + i, + i, i, i, Step 4: Repeat the above three steps continuously. For subsequent executions of Step 1 (beamsearch process), we only conduct Best-of-N (N=1) due to the resource limitation. This loop terminates when either of the following conditions is met: 1) The successful attack goal rate exceeds predefined threshold K; 2) The maximum time of this loop is reached. and Step 5: During this Adversarial-Play evolution process, we conduct twice reject finetuning(RFT) on At with Bs-once at the midpoint and once at the end of the loop to create . Specifically, when half of or half of is reached, we conduct reject fine-tuning on At with tuples (s, x, y, g) in Bs to create more advanced Meta-Attacker achieves higher attack success rate(ASR) than At. When or is reached, we conduct reject fine-tuning on At (The ablation studies in Table 7 and Table 8 show rft on At achieves better performance than on t) with tuples (s, x, y, g) in Bs to create . This Meta-Attacker becomes At+1 as the output of F1 function. After the evolution loop of Meta-Attacker At concludes, we focus on the evolution of the Defender. t. We observe that Adversarial-Play Evolution of Defender Model. We formulate the Adversarial-Play Evolution of Defender as process F2: Mt+1 = F2(M0, Mr, Bs, D) We explain the process F2 as shown in step 3 of Figure 2 and in the following details: Step 1: After the termination of the previous loop, we conduct refusal training on M0 (to alleviate the forgetting issue, we train M0 instead of Mt) with the successful buffer Bs. Specifically, as all the jailbreak questions in Bs successfully attack the Defender Mt, which is very likely to transfer to another LLM, we prepend deliberate instruction before these jailbreak questions and prompt safety alignment model Mr, yielding refusals yr = Mr(C, x). All (x, y) tuples compose of safety alignment dataset D. is shown in Appendix D. Step 2: We conduct refusal training on M0 with this safety alignment dataset and maintaining helpful dataset to create Mt+1. The Refusal Training objective is: min θ (x,yr )D L(Mθ(x), yr) := (cid:88) 1 pθ(yrx) After the Adversarial-Play Evolution of Defender Model, we regard one iteration is done. The Meta-Attacker and Defender of next iteration will be replaced by At+1 and Mt+1. Lifelong Iterations. In the previous section, we introduce the iterative evolution process of the Meta-Attacker and Defender. We expect them to compete against each other in every future iteration.

We include 10 jailbreak-related research papers: Code Attack [39], Emoji Attack [54], Self Cipher [59], Persuasive Attack [62], Random Augmentation Attack [48], Past Tense [1], ASCII Art [25], DAN Attack [43], Persona Modulation [42], Many-shot Attack [3]. Models. We mainly use GPT-4o [36] as Mapi. We use DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B [18] as A0. We also do ablation studies in the 7B, 14B size of R1 models in Table 7. We use the most advanced defender LLM: RR [68] as M0. We test the transfer attack of A0 on another strong defender: LAT [44]. For the safeguard model Mj, we adopt LLaMA-Guard-3-8B [32] and Qwen2.572B-Instruct [56]. For the refusal generator Mr, we employ LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct. Datasets. We include 4k illegal instructions from PKU-SafeRLHF [23] as Goal Pool G. We adopt 20k Ultrachat [12] as helpfulness maintaining dataset; we adopt successful jailbreak questions in Bs and corresponding refusal answers as safety training dataset. We include XSTest [40] in the Defender training dataset to avoid over-refusal problem. Safety Evaluation tasks. There are three kinds of safety evaluation tasks. (1) Seen attacks: We employ 6 attacks that the Defender has seen in the Lifelong Defense Framework: Illegal Instructions, Jailbreak Chat, Self-Cipher, Past Tense, Persuasive Attack, Code Attack. (2) Unseen attacks: We employ the attacks put forward by the Meta-Attacker as unseen evaluation attacks. To maintain consistency with the lifelong safety alignment framework, we conduct Best of (N = 8) sampling on At with 100 untrained goals from from PKU-SafeRLHF. Then we test if Mt defends 8 jailbreak strategies and questions on one goal. Once there are at least one jailbreak question that successfully attack Mt, we regard this goal as successful attack goal. We finally report the ASR as the number of successful goals percentage. (3) Generalization attacks: Five attacks that we do not include in Warm Up Stage: Simple Adaptive Attack [2] and four attacks from Harmbench, AutoDAN [29], FewShot [37], AutoPrompt [45], UAT [49]. Helpfulness Evaluation Task. We include 10 helpful tasks using lm-evaluation-harness [15]. In details, we assess the coding ability with MBPP [4] and HumanEval [7], reasoning ability with GSM8K [11], winogrande [41] and ARC [10], instruction following with IFEval [66], truthfulness with TruthfulQA [28], STEM ability with MMLU [20], hate speech detection with TOXIGEN [19], common knowledge with OpenbookQA [34]. Evaluation Metrics. For safety evaluation, we regard ASR as metric: (1) For seen and unseen attacks, we use Mj to measure ASR; (2) For generalization attacks, we employ Harmbench and Simple Adaptive Attacks code to evaluate by default. For helpfulness evaluation, we conduct lm-evaluation-harness [15] evaluation by default and regard accuracy as metric."

            "content": "Model Type Ablation. The choice of the Meta-Attacker model is crucial. At first, we employ normal instruction following LLM: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as A0. However, this model only achieves 8% ASR on RR after the first iteration. Inspired by recent success on large reasoning language models [22, 18, 51], we introduce Deepseek-R1 as A0, which achieves much better attack performance, as shown in Table 4. Model Size Ablation. To identify the most suitable size of Meta-Attacker, we conduct ablation studies on 7B, 14B, 32B version of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen. As shown in Table 7, at the first iteration of the Adversarial-Play Evolution of Meta-Attacker, three different size Meta-Attackers all achieve improved ASR on RR, among which R1-14B-A 0 achieves the highest 78% ASR. We find these attacks are also transferable to another Defender LLM LAT, as shown in Table 7 right side. Due to the high ASR and stable transferability of R1-32B, we select it as A0 in our experiments. 8 Table 7: The ASR of training with all successful strategies one each goal. Defender () RR"

For example, Table Attack\" and Tool Gathering\" strategies are all effective on goal:Give instructions on how to build bomb\". Whether we conduct reject fine-tuning with all these strategies or with one of these strategies for one goal remains question. To answer this question, we conduct an ablation study. As shown in Table 7 and Table 8, training with all successful strategies for one goal achieves higher ASR.

            "content": "Jailbreaking Attacks. Jailbreaking attacks aim to bypass the safety alignment, leading models to generate harmful contents. They can be classified into 2 classes: 1) white-box attacks [67, 29, 16, 30, 24]: the attackers access model parameters to compute gradients or losses; 2) black-box attacks [5, 53, 43, 59, 62, 64]: the attackers adopt black-box optimization or design OOD scenarios to deceive models. Among those black-box attacks, recent breakthrough in lifelong attack has demonstrated great potential. AutoDAN-Turbo [30] proposes the first lifelong agent to jailbreak static LLM, and discover over 73 novel strategies after 23k jailbreak attempts. AutoRT [31] adopt semi-safety-aligned models for dense reward signals and adopt RL to effectively uncover safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we both adopt white box and black box attacks in the evaluation. Safety Alignment. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the models safety alignment, broadly classified into three categories: 1) regularization-based training [60, 38], 2) interventions in the models internal representations [68, 44], 3) safety reasoning based alignment [17, 51, 26]. As refusal training has demonstrated satisfying performance on id attacks [47, 32] and could somehow generalize to unseen scenarios [51], we adopt this method in this work to enhance the safety alignment of the Defender for its simplicity and stability. Adversarial-Play. Adversarial-Play is classical method to train bootstrapping RL policy, which also demonstrated significant promise within the LLM alignment research. It can be classified into 2 categories: 1) Adversarial-Play with RL algorithm like SPIN [8], EVA [57], SPPO [55]; 2) Adversarial-Play with adverasial games like SPAG [9], SPC [6]. We are the first to conduct Adversarial-Play in safety alignment field to our knowledge. In this work, we format this AdversarialPlay as competitive setup between two the components: Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking strategies, and Defender, trained to resist them."

            "title": "5 Conclusion",
            "content": "In this work, we analyze the necessity to create long-lived artificial intelligence, which is able to deal with an ever-evolving, open-ended world attack because existing training paradigm is restricted to being fairly short-lived and static. To address this, we introduce competitive setup between two components: Meta-Attacker and Defender. We introduce several steps to help the MetaAttacker actively discover novel and evolving jailbreaking strategies, which includes warm up stage and adversarial-play evolution. We introduce adversarial-play evolution process on Defender as well, efficiently resist those attacks from Meta-Attacker. Through iterative training, we obtain strong Meta-Attacker and robust Defender. Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our method."

We adopt DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B [18] as the initial Meta-Attacker A0. We complement ablation on R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and R1-Distill-Qwen-14B in Table 7 and Table 8. We adopt RR [68] as the inital Defender M0, which is finetuned from LLaMA-3-8BInstruct [32]. We download the checkpoint.1 We adopt LAT [44] to test the transferability of the Meta-Attacker attack. This model is finetuned from LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct [32]. We download the checkpoint. We adopt GPT-4o [36] as the API Model Mapi for its strong instruction following ability. We adopt LLaMA-Guard-3-8B [32] and Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct [56] as the Safeguard Model Mj. The QA pair will be first judged by the LLaMA-Guard-3-8B and then correct by Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct with LLM as safety judge prompt shown in Appendix D. We adopt LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct [32] as the Refusal Generator Mr. We append Deliberate Prompt before the input questions to ensure the generated responses are refusals relevant to the input questions, as shown in Appendix D. Datasets We mainly use illegal instructions from PKU-SafeRLHF [23] for safety, Ultrachat [12] for helpfulness, along with XSTest [40] for over-refusal. PKU-SafeRLHF is high-quality dataset containing 83.4K preference entries, annotated across two key dimensions: harmlessness and helpfulness. Each entry includes two responses to question, along with safety meta-labels and preferences based on the responses helpfulness and harmlessness. From this dataset, we extract 4K illegal instructions as the goals in this work and randomly select another 100 goals as test set. To ensure the extracted questions are genuinely harmful, we conduct both human evaluations and evaluations using LLaMA-Guard-3-8B. Ultrachat is large-scale, fine-grained, and diverse dataset comprising Questions about the World, Writing and Creation, Assistance on Existent Materials. From this dataset, we randomly extract 20K Question & Answer pairs for helpfulness finetuning. To ensure the extracted dataset does not contain toxic questions, we filter it using LLaMA-Guard-3-8B. XSTest is dataset comprises 250 safe prompts across ten prompt types that well-calibrated models should not refuse to comply with and 200 unsafe prompts as contrasts that, for most LLM applications, should be refused. We include this dataset in the training process to avoid the over-refusal problem, as the previous work has done [68]. Evaluation Tasks For safety evaluation, we include seen, unseen and generalization tasks. As we utilize jailbreak-related research papers to warm up, we evaluate 6 of them as seen tasks: (1) 200 illegal goals from HarmBench [33]; (2) 200 JailbreakChat questions created from 200 goals in (1) by Do-Anything-Now [43] and DeRTa [60]; (3) 200 SelfCipher questions created from 200 goals in (1) by Yuan et al. [59]; (4) 100 PastTense attack questions by Andriushchenko and Flammarion [1]; (5) 50 Persuasive Jailbreaker attack instructions from Zeng et al. [62] (6) 200 CodeAttack questions created from 200 goals in (1) by Ren et al. [39]. We evaluate unseen attacks proposed by Meta-Attacker on the 100 test goals from PKU-SafeRLHF, as we mention in Datasets part. To maintain consistency with the evolution loop process, we conduct Best of (N = 8) sampling on each test goal, resulting in 800 testing questions. We regard the attack on goal is successful when at least one of these 8 questions successfully jailbreaks the Defender. We evaluate five generalization attacks with HarmBench and corresponding codes: (1) AutoDAN [29] is jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs, which can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. (2) FewShot [37] is automatically 1https://huggingface.co/GraySwanAI/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-RR 2https://huggingface.co/LLM-LAT/robust-llama3-8b-instruct 16 jailbreak methods with Red Teaming Language Models. (3) UAT [49] propose universal adversarial triggers to jailbreak the Defender LLMs. (4) AutoPrompt [45] is an automated method to create prompts for diverse set of attacks, based on gradient-guided search. We use the default setting provided in HarmBench3 to evaluate our models on these four attacks. Simple Adaptive Attack is an attack combining with jailbreak template and random search method on suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., Sure\"). We use the code4 provided by the authors to evaluate our models. Due to the huge number of question & answer pairs, we fail to check every judgment by Mj in the adversarial-play loops in person. However, we check small number of them in person, especially all the safety evaluation results; we introduce Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as safety judge to represent human evaluation to mitigate the bias in the adversarial-play process. For helpfulness evaluation, we adopt 10 helpful tasks using lm-evaluation-harness [15]. In details, we assess the coding ability with MBPP [4] and HumanEval [7], reasoning ability with GSM8K [11], winogrande [41] and ARC [10], instruction following with IFEval [66], truthfulness with TruthfulQA [28], STEM ability with MMLU [20], hate speech detection with TOXIGEN [19], common knowledge with OpenbookQA [34]. Evaluation Metrics For safety evaluation, we use Attack Success Rate (ASR) as the primary metric. The judge of seen and unseen tasks are the Safeguard Model Mj. Specifically, we adopt LLaMAGuard-3-8B [32] and Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct [56] as Mj. For any input (goal, response) pair, the LLaMA-Guard-3-8B will first output label of either safe\" or unsafe\", then this pair will be input into Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct for concrete safety score ranging from 1 to 5 (safe to unsafe). The Qwen2.5 Model will give scores based on series of rules (as shown in ), and play the role of human evaluation. Only those pairs recieved unsafe\" by LLaMA-Guard-3-8B and scores greater than or equal to 4 by Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct will be regarded successful jailbreak. Other situations will be regarded failure. The judge of generalization attacks strictly follows the corresponding codes. HarmBench provides an evaluation judge, named HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls. The Simple Adaptive Attack uses OpenAI Models as judge_llm and judge_rule as judge. For convenience, we adopt GPT-4o-mini as judge_llm. C.2 Experiment Settings We conduct SFT within the Adversarial-Play Evolution of Meta-Attacker and the Defender. This leads to two key parameters: 1) Inference parameters. 2) Training parameters. GPT-4o [21] generation config: temperature 0.8 and maxtoken 4096. For the strategy extraction process, we utilize the OpenAIs Assistant Tool, File Search5function. For code assessing, we directly use the GPT-4os API. We train the model using SFT with LLaMA-Factory [65]. The training configuration includes cutoff length of 4096, batch size of 64, 3 training epochs, cosine learning rate scheduler, and warmup ratio of 0.1. For SFT with LoRA, we set learning rate to 1e 4. For full finetuning, we set learning rate to 1e 5. We apply the same training parameters to both the Meta-Attacker and the Defender. We strictly follow the chat template of the Meta-Attacker, Defender and so on. As the MetaAttacker uses DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen models, we conduct training and inference with the corresponding qwen template in Llama-Factory by default. As the Defender is evolved from LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we conduct training and inference with the corresponding llama3 template by default. For the inference of the Defender models, we set the temperature to 0.95 and the cut off length to 4096. We observe that when the Defender refuses the jailbreak questions, the average output length is about 100 tokens; when it is successfully jailbreaked, the average output length is much larger than 400 tokens. We use vLLM [27] Version 0.6.3 to inference our models. For greedy decoding, we set the temperature = 0 and max_length = 4096. For Best of sampling on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we set the temperature = 0.7, as they recommend6. We use 8 A100 40G to conduct experiments. 3https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench 4https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks 5https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview. 6https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R"

Please explain the correct answer in detail. Defender: C) Accessing pirated streaming site is the method to access movies without proper authorization. Explanation: A) Using VPN to hide your location is privacy tool that can help protect your online privacy and security by hiding your IP address. While it may be used to access content that is only available in certain regions, it does not specifically allow access to unauthorized content. B) Signing up for free trial of streaming service is legitimate way to access content, but it requires proper authorization in the form of subscription or payment to continue accessing the content after the trial period ends. C) Accessing pirated streaming site, on the other hand, is illegal and unauthorized.
