INTRODUCTION In remote sensing, Change Detection (CD) aims to identify alterations on the Earths surface over time by comparing satellite observations of the same area acquired at different time points [1]. CD serves as core component in broad set of real-world applications, including monitoring and assessing natural disasters and climate variability [24], supporting policy and urban planning decisions [5], mapping land use and agricultural cover [6, 7], and military-oriented analysis [8]. In practice, the main difficulty in CD is not the definition of the task but the nuisance differences that arise between acquisitions. Multi-temporal satellite images frequently vary due to changing illumination conditions [9, 10], misalignment from imperfect registration [11, 12], sensor-specific spatial resolution [13]. and measurement noise [14, 15]. These effects can mimic real changes and lead to false detections, making robustness to cross-time inconsistencies central challenge for reliable CD. Motivated by the success of deep learning, many modern CD pipelines rely on deep neural networks and have reported substantial improvements across multiple benchmarks [16 21]. Representative directions include convolutional architectures [16, 22, 17], transformer-based models [19, 18], and more recently diffusion-based approaches [20, 23]. Most supervised change detection (CD) methods are discriminative: given bi-temporal pair (pre-change and postchange images), they directly regress change segmentation mask in single shot. However, CD inherently couples global reasoning with precise localization: the model must first reconcile the overall scene context across time (e.g., viewpoint, illumination, and background content) and then resolve finegrained change boundaries. This structure makes CD naturally compatible with coarse-to-fine prediction process that resembles how humans inspect changes, forming an initial global hypothesis and progressively refining local details. Accordingly, we formulate CD as conditional autoregressive prediction in discrete token space, where the change map is generated stage by stage from low to high resolution. This view is timely given the rapid progress of visual autoregressive models (VARs) [24]. Compared with diffusionbased generative approaches, VAR-style generation provides practical efficiency advantage at inference: diffusion models typically require many iterative denoising steps, whereas VAR produces outputs in small number of coarse-to-fine autoregressive stages. VARs have demonstrated strong generative capabilities, yet their adaptability to discriminative, pixel-level tasks has been rarely explored and has never been studied for remote sensing change detection. To bridge this gap, we propose RemoteVAR, VAR-based CD framework that redesigns conditioning and training for controllable, highaccuracy change map generation. RemoteVAR produces the change map directly via coarse-to-fine autoregressive decoding conditioned on multi-resolution bi-temporal cues. II. BACKGROUND Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) [24] predict discrete visual tokens using scale-wise autoregression, generating tokens from coarse to fine resolutions to form global structure before refining details. These tokens are obtained with residual multi-scale VQ-VAE, which constructs tokenization scheme with varying token resolutions to encode an image into pyramid of multi-scale tokens from coarse to fine, and quantizes latent grids into codebook indices where finer scales capture remaining details. ControlVAR [25] extends VAR to conditional prediction by guiding token generation with additional context tokens (e.g., segmentation masks), improving controllability of the output. Fig. 1. Overview of the RemoteVAR architecture and training pipeline. For clarity, we visualize only the first three token scales with grid sizes 11, 22, and 33. Pre-image, post-image, and fused feature streams are color-coded in red, blue, and green, respectively. Trainable modules are marked with fire icon, while frozen components are marked with an ice icon. III. METHODOLOGY Given bi-temporal pair consisting of pre-change and post-change image, we perform change detection by generating discrete mask tokens rather than directly regressing pixels. We adopt the original VAR residual VQ-VAE as frozen, scale-wise residual tokenizer with 10 token resolutions (from 1 1 to 16 16 across 10 scales: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16} with token grids s) to map each pre/post image (and the ground-truth mask during training) into token IDs from fixed vocabulary of size =4096. For each scale s, we obtain token grids zpre ; token IDs are converted to embeddings via the shared codebook and projected to the VAR embedding dimension. To mitigate severe foregroundbackground imbalance, we convert binary mask tokens into location aware RGB-coded representations following [25] to increase token diversity, while keeping an efficient inverse mapping back to binary mask. , and zm , zpost s , zpost We then construct scale-wise sequence by interleaving tokens per scale as [zpre , zm ], and enrich it with absolute 2D positional embeddings as well as scale embeddings so the model can distinguish pre/post/mask streams while still sharing parameters across scales. During training, we use teacher forcing and compute the loss only on mask tokens, treating preand post-image tokens as context for selfattention. In contrast to ControlVAR [25], which relies only on selfattention among discrete tokens for conditioning, we introduce an explicit cross-attention mechanism that injects fused continuous features into the causal transformer to improve spatial grounding for mask prediction. Specifically, beyond discrete token conditioning, we derive continuous, pixel-level feature maps directly from the VQ-VAE encoder that is already used for tokenization, removing the need for an additional feature-extraction backbone. The VQ-VAE encoder is reused as shared-weight pre/post encoder, analogous to the Siamese encoders that are widely adopted in change detection for modeling bi-temporal inputs. To explicitly combine information across time, we apply lightweight fusion modules adapted from CMX [26] to fuse the continuous features from the preand post-image streams into unified conditioning representation, which is then used as the cross-attention memory, i.e., its projected embeddings serve as the keys and values, while the causal transformer token states act as queries. Unlike discrete tokens, these continuous features do not suffer from tokenization/discretization artifacts, providing crucial finegrained information for accurate boundary localization and small-object changes. Moreover, to reduce exposure bias from teacher forcing, we randomly replace subset of early-scale mask tokens with random codebook tokens during training, so the model learns to recover the ground-truth tokens under imperfect coarse predictions that better match autoregressive inference. The overall training procedure and architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. At inference time, we provide zpre via teacher forcing and autoregressively predict zm in coarse-to-fine, scale-wise manner. To transition between successive scales, and zpost Fig. 2.

All experiments are run on 8 NVIDIA A5000 GPUs with 24 GB memory each. B. Experimental setup. We evaluate RemoteVAR on two widely used building change detection benchmarks, LEVIR-CD [28] and WHUCD [27]. LEVIR-CD contains VHR Google Earth image pairs with building changes, while WHU-CD provides large-scale aerial imagery collected at different years for building change detection. Following standard practice, we report performance on the official splits using F1 score, IoU, and overall pixel accuracy (OA) as the primary metrics, where F1/IoU emphasize the changed class under heavy class imbalance. C. Baselines We compare against representative diffusion-, Mamba/SSM- , transformer-, CNN-, and self-supervised approaches. DDPMCD [20] is diffusion-feature-based change detector, RSMamba [32] uses Siamese Mamba/SSM backbone, and ChangeFormer [19] and BiT [18] are transformer-based bi-temporal change detection models. For CNN baselines, SNUNet [16] and STANet [29] follow Siamese encoder decoder designs with enhanced fusion/attention. We also include self-supervised pretraining baselines, SeCo [30] and SaDL-CD [31], which learn representations from unlabeled temporal imagery and are then fine-tuned for change detection. D. Results Quantitative results are reported in Table I. On WHUCD, RemoteVAR achieves the best performance with F1 = 0.930 and IoU = 0.870, slightly improving over strong baselines such as DDPM-CD [20] (0.927/0.863) and RSMamba [32] (0.927/0.865). On LEVIR-CD, RemoteVAR remains competitive and reaches the top performance with F1 = 0.910 and IoU = 0.834, marginally exceeding DDPM-CD (0.909/0.833) and outperforming the remaining transformer/CNN/self-supervised baselines by varying margins. Qualitative comparisons in Fig. 4 further show that RemoteVAR produces cleaner masks and detects subtle structural changes with more accurate localization, which we attribute Fig. 3. Decoder refinement procedure is illustrated. we upsample the predicted mask tokens from the previous resolution to the next target grid before generation (e.g., the 1010 prediction is upsampled to 1313 and used as the starting context for the 9th scale), enabling progressive refinement of the change map as spatial resolution increases (see Fig. 2). After autoregressive inference, the predicted mask tokens are mapped back through the codebook and decoded to pixel space by the VQ-VAE decoder. We then perform decoder refining to further sharpen boundaries and recover fine details: we augment the decoder with UNet-style skip connections, where the skip features come from our multi-scale fusion modules (rather than directly from the encoder), and finetune the decoder with binary cross-entropy objective on the change map. This refinement improves boundary localization and small-object changes while keeping the autoregressive generator fixed. This process is illustrated in Fig. 3. IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS A. Implementation Details All images are resized to 256 256, and models are trained for 100 epochs with batch size of 48 using AdamW (learning rate 1 104). Weight decay is set to 1 104 and annealed to 0 with cosine schedule. The learning rate follows cosine schedule with linear warmup, and gradients are clipped to norm of 2.0. Mixed-precision (FP16) training is applied. To increase the number of training samples and promote token diversity, training is performed on the union of binary change TABLE QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON ON WHU-CD [27] AND LEVIR-CD [28] USING F1, IOU, AND OVERALL ACCURACY (OA).

TABLE II ABLATION RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN WHU-CD [27]. E. Ablation Studies We analyze the contribution of each design choice on WHU-CD [27], with results summarized in Table II. No Cross-Att removes our cross-attention conditioning and yields that conditions only through ControlVAR-style variant self-attention over discrete tokens; unlike the original ControlVAR [25] (single-condition), our setting is bi-conditioned on both preand post-image tokens. No Location Aware RGB Masks disables our RGB-based mask token conversion and uses binary mask tokens directly, which increases token imbalance and reduces mask token diversity. No TokRand removes the early-scale token randomization used during teacher forcing; this variant is directly related to exposure bias because the model is trained only on ground-truth coarse tokens and is not exposed to imperfect coarse predictions that arise at autoregressive inference. No DecRef disables the decoder refining stage and outputs the change map using the fixed VQ-VAE decoder (pure autoregressive prediction without refinement). Overall, each component provides complementary gains, and the full RemoteVAR achieves the best performance.

CONCLUSION We introduce RemoteVAR, bi-temporal autoregressive change detection framework that generates multi-scale mask tokens in coarse-to-fine manner. By combining discrete token generation with fused continuous pre/post features injected via cross-attention, RemoteVAR achieves accurate localization and strong performance on public benchmarks, matching or surpassing competitive Diffusion-, Transformer-, Mamba-, and CNN-based baselines. The results suggest that autoregressive modeling is practical and effective alternative for dense remote sensing change detection."
