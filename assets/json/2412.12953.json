            "content": "Diffusion models learn to reverse an iterative process that adds Gaussian noise to data samples (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020). After training, they can generate new samples conditioned on goals like instructions or images. Recently, diffusion models have gained widespread adoption as policies for Imitation Learning (IL) (Octo Model Team et al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023). IL is powerful paradigm to train agents from expert demonstrations to learn versatile skills (Pomerleau, 1989; Nair et al., 2017; Pari et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2024). Diffusion policies offer several appealing properties for IL: they can generate diverse multimodal behavior (Jia et al., 2024), scale with more data (Octo Model Team et al., 2023), and handle discontinuities in the action space (Chi et al., 2023). However, major limitation is their high computational cost, resulting in slower training and inference speed as models become larger. Standard architectures contain hundreds of millions of parameters (Chi et al., 2023) and require many denoising steps to generate actions. Large encoder modules for images and text further increase the computational requirements for IL policies. This restricts their use in real-time robotics applications, particularly in scenarios with limited on-board computing resources, such as mobile robots. To address these challenges, we explore Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) that can scale model capacity while using fewer FLOPs for training and inference. The core idea behind sparse MoE is to utilize only subset of the total model parameters during each forward pass. This is achieved by having"

They are used as policy representation for Imitation Learning (Chi et al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2024; Xian et al., 2023; Ke et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023b; Scheikl et al., 2023) and in Offline Reinforcement Learning (Ajay et al., 2023a; Janner et al., 2022; Pari et al., 2022). Other applications of diffusion models in robotics include robot design generation (Wang et al., 2023), video-generation (Du et al., 2023; Ko et al., 2023; Ajay et al., 2023b) and motion planning (Carvalho et al., 2023; Urain et al., 2023).

Sparse-DP leverages MoE to learn specialist experts for different tasks (Wang et al., 2024). However, no prior work considers using Mixture of Experts architecture for improving the computational efficiency and inference time of the denoising process for generalist policies. Mixture-of-Experts. MoE are class of models where information is selectively routed through the model. The modern version of MoE was introduced in (Shazeer et al., 2017), where routing or gating network conditionally chooses subset of experts to send an input to. After Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) proved to be an effective model that scales well with data, they were modified to have expert feed-forward networks at each block of the model in (Fedus et al., 2022) which presented Switch Transformers. Switch Transformers laid the groundwork that is still widely adopted in different Large-Language-Models (LLM) (Jiang et al., 2024; Du et al., 2022). This allowed for more total parameters while keeping the forward and backward FLOPs smaller than their dense counterpart, thus yielding significant performance gains. However, training both the router and experts in parallel is non-trivial optimization problem, and it can yield suboptimal solutions such as expert collapse where experts learn similar functions instead of specializing (Chi et al., 2022). In addition, router collapse occurs when the router selects small subset of the experts and doesnt utilize all the experts. This is mitigated with load balancing losses (Shazeer et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2022) which encourage the router to distribute inputs more evenly across experts. Multiple works have explored different methods to perform routing, such as expert choice routing (Zhou et al., 2022), differential k-selection (Hazimeh et al., 2021), frozen hashing functions (Roller et al., 2021), and linear assignment (Lewis et al., 2021). Multi Task Learning in Diffusion Models. It has been shown that the denoising process is multi-task Hang et al. (2024). Leveraging this idea, works have adopted architectures suited for multi-task learning. Some works have explicitly scheduled which parameters are specialized to which stage in the denoising process (Park et al., 2023; Go et al., 2023). In extension to this (Park et al., 2024) uses the scheduling as guidance during training but also learns how to modulate representations based on the denoising stage. Finally, some works have employed different architectures based on the denoising stage (Lee et al., 2024b)."

            "content": "In this section, we introduce MoDE, our novel MoE Diffusion Policy. First, we formulate the problem of learning policy for IL. Next, we summarize the framework used in Diffusion Policies and then introduce our MoDE architecture with our novel noise-conditioned routing and noise-conditioned self-attention that enable efficient policy design. Finally, we explain our expert caching mechanism for efficient inference and explain the pretraining of MoDE. 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION We consider the problem of learning language-conditioned policy πθ(as, g) given dataset of robot demonstrations . The policy predicts sequence of future actions = (a, . . . , ai+j1) of length j, conditioned on the history of state embeddings = (sih+1, . . . , si) of length and desired goal g. The dataset contains τ trajectories, where trajectory consists of sequence of triplets of state, actions, and goal (si, ai, g). is language instruction. Our policy is trained to maximize the log-likelihood of the action sequence given the context of state history and goal: LIL = (cid:88) (s,a,g)T log πθ (as, g) .

Diffusion models are type of generative model for generating data by initially adding noise through Gaussian perturbations and then reversing this process.

To generate new samples from noise neural network is trained to approximate the score function log pt(as, g) via Score matching (SM) (Vincent, 2011) LSM = Eσ,a,ϵ (cid:2)α(σt)Dθ(a + ϵ, s, g, σt) a2 2 (cid:3), (3) where Dθ(a + ϵ, s, g, σt) is the trainable neural network. During training, we sample noise from training distribution and add it to an action sequence. The network predicts the denoised actions and computes the SM loss. After training, we can generate new action sequence starting from random noise by approximating the reverse SDE or related ODE in discrete steps using numerical ODE integrators. Therefore, we sample noise from the prior aT (0, σ2 I) and iteratively denoise it. MoDE uses the DDIM-solver, numerical ODE-solver designed for diffusion models (Song et al., 2021), that allows fast denoising of actions in few steps. MoDE uses 10 denoising steps in all our experiments. 3.3 MIXTURE-OF-EXPERTS DENOISING We now introduce MoDE, novel approach that employs noise-conditioned expert routing to enhance diffusion-based policies. This novel routing mechanism enables us to precompute and fuse the required experts for more efficient inference. An overview of MoDEs architecture with the routing mechanism is shown in Figure 1. For language conditioning, MoDE leverages frozen CLIP language encoder to generate latent goal vector, while image encoding utilizes FiLM-conditioned ResNets-18/50. The model processes sequence of input tokens RtokensD and noise level σt. linear projection layer ϕ(σt) encodes the noise level into token, which is incorporated into X. The complete MoDE architecture, MoDE(X, ϕ(σt)), consists of transformer blocks, each specialized for different denoising phases. We now define each block as composition of self-attention (SA) layer and an MoE layer, i(X, ϕ(σt)) = MoE(SA( ˆX) + X, ϕ(σt)) + X. (4) key change in our approach is the integration of noise-aware positional embeddings. By adding ϕ(σt) to all tokens in before self-attention: ˆX = ϕ(σt) + X, (5) we enable each token to adapt its attention patterns based on the current denoising phase. This design enhances denoising performance without introducing additional parameters or architectural complexity. The self-attention mechanism follows the standard formulation (Vaswani et al., 2017): SA( ˆX) = softmax( 1 [ ˆXWQ][ ˆXWK]T )[ ˆXWV ]. (6) Our MoE layer introduces novel noise-conditioned routing strategy. Given experts Eii = 1N , the layer output is: MoE(X, ϕ(σt)) = = 1NR(ϕ(σt))Ei(X), (cid:88) where the routing function R() : RtokensD RtokensN determines expert selection: R(ϕ(σt)) = topk(softmax(ϕ(σt)WR), k) (7) (8) Unlike traditional MoE approaches that route based on input content, MoDEs routing mechanism specifically considers the noise level. This enables specialized experts for different denoising phases, allowing for both improved performance and computational efficiency through expert caching (detailed in subsubsection 3.3.1). We utilize the same method from (Muennighoff et al., 2024) to initialize"

This enables removing the router and retaining only the selected experts, significantly improving network efficiency. the router, which is from truncated normal distribution with std = 0.02. We implement topk using multinomial sampling without replacement, selecting elements according to softmax(ϕ(σt)WR) probabilities. To maintain gradient flow through the non-differentiable sampling process, we scale expert outputs by routing probabilities and renormalize the selected probabilities. To prevent expert collapse, we incorporate load balancing loss (LB) (Fedus et al., 2022): LB(σt) = (cid:88) (cid:88) ( 1R(ϕ(σti ))n > 0) 1 n=1 with γ = 0.01 as the balancing coefficient. i=1 (cid:88) 1 ( = 1Bsoftmax(ϕ(σti)WR)n) (9) 3.3.1 ROUTER AND EXPERT CACHING To make our method more efficient, we exploit the fact that our MoE is noise-conditioned, meaning where at each noise level, the routing path is deterministic and can be precomputed. By doing so, we can determine the chosen experts ahead of time for each noise level. Figure 2 illustrates this process. This allows us to fuse the selected expert MLPs into single, composite MLP, effectively reducing the computation cost. Instead of looping through each expert individually, this fused expert MLP can run in parallel, which substantially decreases the overall latency of the network. By eliminating the need for dynamically invoking each expert, we not only save time but also streamline memory access patterns, reducing the overhead typically associated with routing decisions in traditional MoE setup. Our caching strategy reduces the FLOPs overhead by over 80% compared to standard MoE rollouts and makes it two times faster during inference. 3.4 GENERALIST POLICY PRE-TRAINING We pretrain MoDE on diverse mix of multi-robot datasets curated from the OXE dataset Collaboration et al. (2023). Our training data encompasses 196k trajectories selected from six diverse datasets, featuring various robot platforms and manipulation tasks. The pretraining process of MoDE runs for 300k steps on distributed Cluster of 6 GPUs over three days For finetuning we freeze the pretrained routers in each layer and only finetune the other model components. comprehensive overview of our pretraining dataset composition and methodology is provided in the Appendix (subsection A.1).

We first evaluate MoDE on the LONG-challenge and LIBERO-90 challenge of the LIBERO benchmark (Liu et al., 2023). The LONG challenge requires model to learn 10 tasks in different settings. It demands long-horizon behavior generation with several hundreds of steps for completion. The 90 variant tests policies on 90 diverse short-horizon tasks in different environments. Figure 3a visualizes few examples of these tasks. All environments feature two cameras: static one and wrist-mounted camera, used to encode the current observation using FiLM-ResNets-18.

We tested all baselines ourselves, except for QueST, whose results are taken directly from their paper. Results. The performance of all models on the benchmark is summarized in Figure 3b. Overall, MoDE achieves the highest average performance in both benchmarks, while the QueST baseline is the second best in the LIBERO-90 setting and the CNN-architecture is second best in the long horizon setting. These results demonstrate MoDEs ability to learn long-horizon tasks with high accuracy. The performance gap is more pronounced in the challenging LIBERO-10 experiment, where MoDE is the first policy to achieve an over 90% success rate. Furthermore, MoDE surpasses prior best Diffusion baselines by an average of 16% in both settings, all while maintaining its computational advantage. The pretrained MoDE variant achieves an even higher performance in both settings, showing the potential of diverse pretraining.

These tasks require the acquisition of complex, sequential behaviors and the ability to chain together different skills. Figure 4a depicts the diverse configurations of interactive elements within these environments. This particular challenge examines the scaling abilities of policies trained on rich variety of data and skills across multiple settings.

One example rollout with 5 different tasks is visualized in Figure 4b.

For this experiment, we compare MODE against the previous CALVIN baselines, with the addition of SuSIE (Black et al., 2023). hierarchical policy utilizing finetuned image-generation model, Instruct2Pix (Brooks et al., 2023), to generate goal images, which guide low-level diffusion policy. The high-level goal generation model requires large-scale pretraining. SuSIEs results are based on 100 rollouts only, without standard deviation, due to the computational cost of generating subgoal images. Results. The results of this experiment are summarized in the lower part of Table 1. MoDE outperforms all tested baselines and surpasses all other Diffusion Policy architectures by wide margin. Further, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve new sota performance of 4.01. Therefore, in response to Question (I), we affirmatively conclude that Mixture-of-Experts models not only enhance scaling performance but also demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In addition, we can answer Question (II) by concluding that pretraining boost performance in challenging zero-shot settings. 4.4 COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF MODE MoDE w/ Cache MoDE w/o Cache Dense-T Figure 5: Computational efficiency comparison between MoDE and Dense-Transformer model with the same number of parameters. Left: Average inference speed over 100 forward passes for various batch sizes. Right: FLOP count for MoDE with router cache and without compared against dense baseline. MoDE demonstrates superior efficiency with lower FLOP count and faster inference thanks to its router caching and sparse expert design. We compare MoDE against dense transformer baseline with similar parameters by measuring average inference time and FLOPs across batch sizes. As shown in Figure Figure 5, MoDE with caching significantly improves computational efficiency - at batch size 1, inference is 20% faster (12ms vs 15ms), while at batch size 512, MoDE requires 16x fewer FLOPs (361 vs 5,772 GFLOPS) and achieves nearly 40% faster inference (64ms vs 104ms). These results demonstrate that MoDE delivers both superior task performance and substantial computational efficiency through its architecture and caching mechanism. detailed comparison of inference speed and FLOPS against all other baselines on CALVIN is summarized in subsection A.4."

            "title": "4.5.1 WHAT DESIGN DECISIONS AFFECT MODE’S PERFORMANCE?",
            "content": "First, we assess the impact of various design decisions on MoDEs performance. We ablate the choice of noise-conditioning and various MoE strategies on the LIBERO-10 benchmark. The results are summarized in Table 2. Noise-Injection Ablations. Our experiments reveal the importance of proper noise conditioning in MoDE. The full MoDE model, which uses both input noise tokens and noise-conditioned selfattention, achieves the best performance with an average success rate of 0.92. Removing the input noise token slightly decreases performance to 0.90, highlighting the complementary nature of both conditioning methods. Using only the noise token for conditioning, without noise-conditioned selfattention, further reduces performance to 0.85. Interestingly, using FiLM conditioning (Perez et al., 2018), common approach in image-diffusion (Peebles & Xie, 2023), yields the lowest performance in this group at 0.81. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed noise conditioning strategy in MoDE, demonstrating clear performance advantage of 0.08 over the FiLM approach. MoE Ablations. Next, we ablate several design decisions regarding Mixture-of-Experts. First, we test the topk number of used experts. Setting topk to 1 only marginally lowers the average performance from 0.92 to 0.91. MoDE maintains robust performance even with single expert. We also examine the effect of using shared expert, where the model consistently employs the same expert in all cases. This approach achieves comparable average success rate of 0.90. Different choices for the token-distribution loss are also tested. While MoDE uses γ = 0.01 as default value, we experiment with γ values of 0.1 and 0.001, which result in average success rates of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. These results indicate that γ value of 0.01 strikes the best performance. Avg. Success. MoDE - Input Noise Token - Noise-cond Attention FiLM Noise Conditioning TopK=1 Shared Expert γ = 0.1 γ = 0. 256 Embed Dim 512 Embed Dim 0.92 0.90 0.85 0.81 0.91 0.90 0.90 0.86 0.86 0.87 Table 2: Ablation Studies for MoDE on LIBERO-10. All results are averaged over 3 seeds with 20 rollouts each. Latent Dimension. We investigate the impact of varying the latent dimension in MoDE, testing dimensions of 256, 512, and 1024 (our default). The results show that increasing the latent dimension from 256 to 512 yields modest performance improvement from 0.86 to 0.87, while further increasing to 1024 provides more substantial boost to 0.92. This suggests that larger latent dimension allows MoDE to capture more complex representations, leading to improved performance. 4.5.2 OPTIMAL ROUTING STRATEGY FOR DIFFUSION TRANSFORMERS Next, we answer Question (III) by testing different routing strategies for our diffusion-transformer policy across several environments. We test two different token routing strategies: 1) Token-only conditioned Routing and 2) Noise-only Token Routing. (1) is commonly used in LLMs, where the routing is decided based on the tokens only. We test these strategies in five experiments and report the average performance over 3 seeds: Noise-only Routing achieves an average normalized performance of 0.851, slightly outperforming Token-only Routing, which achieves 0.845. Detailed results are summarized in Table 7 in the Appendix. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed routing strategy. While the performance difference is small, Noise-only Routing offers an additional advantage: the ability to predict all used experts based on noise levels once before roll-outs, enabling faster inference, as described in subsubsection 3.3.1. This is particularly beneficial for robotics applications."

            "content": "Figure 6: Visualized Expert Utilization. The average usage of all experts in MoDE across all layers is shown. Purple color corresponds to low usage and yellow color to high one, and each image is separately normalized. The average activation shows that MoDE learns to utilize different experts for different noise levels. 4.5.3 HOW DOES THE MODEL DISTRIBUTE THE TOKENS TO DIFFERENT EXPERTS? To address Question IV, we analyzed how MoDE distributes tokens to different experts using pre-trained model. Figure 6 visualizes the average usage of each expert in each model layer during inference across various noise levels, using 10 denoising steps for clarity. Our analysis reveals that MoDE learns to utilize different experts for various noise levels, suggesting that the router has specialized for different noise regimes. transition in expert utilization occurs around σ8. In the first layer, the model learns an expert specialized for low-noise levels, primarily used in the last denoising step at σmin. We conduct more ablations studies with our pretrained model and various other versions of MoDE in subsubsection A.6.1 of the Appendix. These findings affirmatively answer Question IV, demonstrating that MoDE effectively distributes tokens across experts based on noise levels. 4.5.4 HOW DOES THE MODEL SCALE WITH MORE EXPERTS? Finally, we analyze the effect of increasing the number of experts in MoDE. The results are presented in Figure 8, where we evaluate MoDE on the CALVIN ABCD and CALVIN ABC benchmarks using 2, 4, 6, and 8 experts. For comparison, we include two dense MoDE baselines: Dense-small and Dense-large. Dense-small shares the same latent dimensionality as MoDE, while Dense-large is scaled up to 2024 dimensions, matching MoDEs overall parameter count. Our analysis focuses on how scaling affects both general performance (C-ABCD) and zero-shot generalization (C-ABC). In the ABCD environment, MoDE with 4 experts achieves the best performance. Interestingly, increasing beyond 4 experts degrades performance, possibly due to overfitting or increased routing complexity. In the zero-shot generalization (ABC), MoDE with 4 experts still performs best. Notably, the Dense-small variant consistently underperforms across both tasks, underscoring the efficiency of the MoE architecture in utilizing parameters more effectively. We hypothesize, that 4 experts has an ideal trade-off for the context of noise-only routing of Diffusion Policies. The different expert specialization patterns observed in Figure 6 and Figure 12 from the Appendix show that expert specialization are based on noise regions. MoDE with more than 4 experts does not have performance benefit. Overall, MoDE demonstrates that it can achieve comparable or superior performance to dense transformer models while requiring fewer computational resources. 4.6 LIMITATIONS MoDE still has certain limitations. In our experiments, we find that MoDE exhibits slightly higher standard deviation compared to the baselines. We hypothesize that the routers initialization has significant impact on overall optimization, requiring future work on stabilizing routing models. In addition, when visualizing expert utilization, in some of our experiments we noticed that only subset of the total experts were being utilized - phenomenon known as expert collapse (Chi et al., 2022)."

The pretraining was conducted on 6 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs with 40GB VRAM each over 3 days, completing 300K training steps. We used batch size of 1024 with learning rate of 1e-4 and weight decay of 0.1. To ensure balanced dataset mixing during training, we implemented large shuffle buffer of 400K samples. Each dataset was individually normalized to account for different scales and ranges across the various robot platforms. This diverse pretraining significantly improved MoDEs zero-shot generalization, particularly on challenging benchmarks like CALVIN ABCD where we achieved new state-ofthe-art performance of 4.01 average rollout length.

A.2 EXPERIMENTS DETAILS Average Performance Increase. To quantify MoDEs advantages over existing Diffusion Policies, we compared its performance against the second-best method across all benchmarks. MoDE demonstrated substantial improvements, particularly in challenging transfer scenarios like CALVIN ABCD where it outperformed the next best method by 151.1%. Even on the more standardized LIBERO benchmarks, MoDE maintained significant advantages of 16.7% to 26.0%. Averaging across all tasks, MoDE achieved 57.5% improvement over the second-best performing method while maintaining its computational efficiency with 90% fewer FLOPs compared to dense tranformers with similar number of parameters. A.2.1 MODE EVALUATION ON SIMPLER We evaluate MoDEs capabilities as generalist policy by comparing it against two state-of-the-art models trained on substantially larger datasets from Open-X-Embodiment: Octo (800K trajectories) (Octo Model Team et al., 2023) and OpenVLA (Kim et al., 2024)(1M trajectories). We conduct this comparison using the SIMPLER benchmark, which provides real2sim variants of the BridgeV2 (Walke et al., 2023) and Google Fractal datasets used to train RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2023). The benchmark encompasses diverse manipulation tasks across multiple environments, as illustrated in Figure 7."

MoDE shows particularly strong performance on challenging manipulation tasks like drawer manipulation (34.92% on drawer close) and precise object interactions (40% on vertical can picking). While specialized tasks like stacking blocks remain challenging for all models, MoDEs consistent performance across diverse tasks demonstrates its effectiveness as scalable architecture for generalist policies. A.2.2 CALVIN BENCHMARK The CALVIN benchmark (Mees et al., 2022b) is an established IL benchmark for learning languageconditioned behavior from human play data. In contrast to other benchmarks the data does not contain structured demonstrations, where the robot completes one task, but instead, the dataset was collected by humans, that randomly interact with the environment. From these long-horizon trajectories across the 4 different settings, the authors randomly cut out short sequences with 64 frames and labeled them with the task label. While the dataset offers models to train on the unlabeled part too, we restricted MoDE to only train on the labeled parts. The Franke Emika Panda robot is controlled using Delta-End-Effector Space with discrete gripper. We use two cameras to encode the current scene: static camera and wrist one and predict the next 10 actions, before receiving the next observations and generating another set of 10 actions. CALVIN ABC. We train MoDE and our dense transformer baseline for 25k training steps with batch size of 512 on 4 GPU Cluster Node with 4 A6000 NVIDIA GPUs for 6.5 hours with all 1000 rollouts at the end of training. We report the mean results averaged over 3 seeds as done in all relevant prior work. All baselines are reported from the original paper given the standardized evaluation protocol of CALVIN (Mees et al., 2022b). CALVIN ABCD.

A.3 BASELINES Below we explain several baselines used in the experiments in detail: Diffusion Policy-CNN/T Inspired by (Chi et al., 2023), we evaluate extension of the DDPM based Diffusion Policy framework for goal-conditioned Multi-task learning. We evaluate two versions: the CNN-based variant and the Diffusion-Transformer variant, that is conditioned on context and noise using cross-attention. For our experiments we also use EDM-based Diffusion framework for fair comparison against MoDE. We optimized the ideal number of layers and latent dimension for the Transformer baseline and our final version uses 8 layers with latent dimension of 1024. Larger or smaller variants resulted in lower average performance. RoboFlamingo. RoboFlamingo (Li et al., 2024a) is Vision-Language-Models (VLM) finetuned for behavior generation. The authors use 3 billion parameter Flamingo model (Alayrac et al., 2022) and fine-tune it on CALVIN by freezing the forward blocks and only fine-tuning new Perceiver Resampler module to extract features from frozen vision-transformer image encoder and the crossattention layers to process the image features. Finally, new action head is learned to generate actions. Overall, the finetuning requires training approx. 1 billion of the parameters. We report the reported results from the paper since they use the standard CALVIN evaluation suite. SuSIE. This model first finetunes Instruct2Pix, an image-generation diffusion model, that generates images conditioned on another image and text description (Brooks et al., 2023) on the local CALVIN robotics domain and uses it as high-level goal generator. The low-level policy is CNN-based Diffusion Policy, that predicts the next 4 actions given the current state embedding and desired sub-goal from the high-level policy (Black et al., 2023). GR-1 causal GPT-Transformer model (Wu et al., 2024), that has been pretrained on large-scale generative video prediction of human videos. Later, the model is finetuned using co-training of action prediction and video prediction on CALVIN. We report the results directly from their paper for the CALVIN benchmark."

A.4 AVERAGE FLOPS COMPUTATION AND INFERENCE SPEED We provide an in-depth comparison of the total parameters and FLOPs used for every method in Table 8. Additionally, we provide the computational efficiency metric per GFLOPS (109 FLOPS) to compare the various methods and measure the average prediction time for single action. In the following, we detail the average GFLOPS computation for all relevant baselines on the CALVIN ABC benchmark. Specifically, we compare the average GFLOPS required to predict single action. To guarantee fair comparison we evaluated all methods on the same NVIDIA A6000 GPU with 40 GB VRAM. To compute the average inference speed, we tested each method 100 times and removed large outliers to compute an average time. MoDE. We benchmark the large pretrained variant with 12 layers, 4 experts and hidden dim of 1024. The average GFLOPS for forward pass are 0.7 GFLOPS. Without router caching, the model would require 5 GFLOPS, indicating that the router caching reduces the overall computational cost by over 90%. The architecture processes 14 tokens in total (1 noise + 1 goal + 2 images + 10 noisy action actions). MoDE predicts sequence of 10 actions with 10 denoising passes. For the variant with ResNet-50, the image encoder requires 8.27 GFLOPS . On average for single action, MoDE requires 10 forward passes with the transformer and single pass with the ResNet-50. Consequently, the pretrained variant of MoDE needs 1.53 GFLOPS on average to predict single action. The inference time for that model depends on the hardware. We measure an average inference time per action of 12.2. DP-CNN/T. DP-CNN utilizes 0.8 GFLOPS for an average forward pass. The ResNet-18s require 3.62 GFLOPS. The model predicts 10 actions with 10 denoising steps and executes 10 actions without replanning. This results in the CNN version requiring 1.28 GFLOPS to predict single action. For the Transformer version, the architecture predicts 10 actions using 10 denoising steps and processes 14 tokens in total (1 noise + 1 goal + 2 images + 10 noisy action actions) similar to MoDE. It achieves an average GFLOPS usage of 1.8 GFLOPS per forward pass through the transformer. The DP-T baseline requires 2.16 GFLOPS on average to predict single action. The CNN version requires 11.7 ms to predict single action on average and the transformer variant with its cross-attention conditioning needs 16.2 ms. RoboFlamingo. For computational analysis, the model requires 34 GFLOPS to encode single image with ViT. For the policy backbone, we evaluated the \"mpt-1b-redpajama-200b-dolly\" variant as used in the paper. This architecture requires 656 GFLOPS for an average sequence of 32 tokens per forward pass. While multiple variants of RoboFlamingo exist, this provides rough estimate of the required GFLOPS. In total, we estimate an average of 690 GFLOPS to predict an action in CALVIN. To predict single action, the model requires 65 ms on average. SuSIE. In our computational analysis, we tested Instruct2Pix with 50 denoising steps as implemented by SuSIE. The resulting 1026 GFLOPS are divided by 20 as the model only generates new subgoals every 20 timesteps. The low-level policy uses ResNet-50 image encoder with 8.27 GFLOPS. Contrast to other policies, SuSIe only computes one image per state and predicts actions every timestep. These are then averaged using exponential averaging. Thus, we omit the small diffusion head to get an estimate of 60 GFLOPS per action. For the average inference speed we meassure the time to generate single goal image and divide it by 20, next we add the average time to encode two images with the ResNet-50 and 10 forward passes through small MLP.

On average SuSIE requires 199 ms to generate single action, which make it the slowest policy overall. GR-1. The pretrained MAE Vision Transformer requires approx. 17.5 GFLOPS to encode single image. The transformer backbone processes 150 tokens with history length of 10 and 15 tokens per timestep (10 image tokens + 1 goal token + 1 proprioceptive token + 2 video readout tokens + 1 action token per timestep). Consequently, the average GFLOPS for single action prediction utilizing the decoder with latent dimension of 384 and 12 layers are 10 GFLOPS. In total, this results in an average computational cost of 27.5 for predicting single action in CALVIN. For the average single action prediction the model requires 12.6 ms. Analysis. Overall, MoDE offers the best performance to GFLOPS ratio across all tested baselines. Although MoDE is significantly larger in total size compared to the other Diffusion Policy architectures it requires similar inference speed and low FLOP count. Additionally, it has demonstrated superior efficiency in terms of computational resources while maintaining high performance on the CALVIN benchmark tasks. For inference speed MoDE is the second fastest although it has high total parameter count. A.5 DETAILED EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We summarize the ablations regarding the choice of routing in Table 7. Therefore, we test two 2 different routing strategies across 5 benchmarks. A.6 STATE-BASED EXPERIMENTS We conduct additional experiments with MoDE on two established multi-task state-based environments: Relay Kitchen. We utilize the Franka Kitchen environment from (Lynch et al., 2019) to evaluate models. This virtual kitchen environment allows human participants to manipulate seven objects using VR interface: kettle, microwave, sliding door, hinged door, light switch, and two burners. The resulting dataset consists of 566 demonstrations collected by the original researchers, where each participant performed four predetermined manipulation tasks per episode. The Franka Emika Panda robot is controlled via 9-dimensional action space representing the robots joint and end-effector positions. The 30-dimensional observation space contains information about the current state of the relevant objects in the environment. As desired goal state, we randomly sample future states as desired goal to reach. For this experiment, we train all models for 40k training steps with batch size of 1024 and evaluate them 100 times as done in prior work (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) to guarantee fair evaluation. All reported results are averaged over 4 seeds. We train our models on local PC RTX with an RTX 3070 GPU for approx. 2 hours for each run with the additional experimental rollouts. Block Push. The PyBullet environment features an XArm robot tasked with pushing two blocks into two square targets within plane. The desired order of pushing the blocks and the specific block-target combinations are sampled from the set of 1000 demonstrations as desired goal state. The demonstrations used for training our models were collected using hard-coded controller that selects block to push first and independently chooses target for that block. After pushing the first block to target, the controller pushes the second block to the remaining target. This approach results in four possible modes of behavior, with additional stochasticity arising from the various ways of pushing block into target. The models only get credit, if the blocks have been pushed in the correct target position and order. We consider block successfully pushed if its center is within 0.05 units of target square. All models were trained on dataset of 1000 controller-generated demonstrations under these randomized conditions. All models have been trained for 60k steps with batch size of 1024. To evaluate them we follow prior work (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) and test them on 100 different instructions and report the average result over 4 seeds. We train our models on local PC RTX 3070 GPU for approx. 3 hours for each run with final evaluation."

Demonstrations are sourced from scripted oracle, which first pushes randomly chosen block to selected square, followed by the other block to different square. The policies are conditioned to push the blocks in the desired configuration using goal state-vector. We chose an action sequence length of 1 given history length of 4 for these experiments, which are inspired by our dense diffusion transformer baseline BESO (Reuss et al., 2023).

We test two transformer architectures, C-BeT (Cui et al., 2023) and VQ-BeT (Lee et al., 2024a), that predict discretized actions with an offset. C-BeT uses k-means clustering together with an offset vector while VQ-BeT leverages residual Vector Quantization to embed actions into hierarchical latent space. Further, we test against dense diffusion policy transformer model BESO (Reuss et al., 2023). BESO uses the same continuous-time diffusion policy combined with dense transformer to predict single action given sequence of prior states. To enable fair comparison, we chose the same hyperparameters for BESO and MoDE in both settings. We test all models averaged over 4 seeds and report the mean values directly from prior work (Lee et al., 2024a).

The results of both experiments are summarized in Table 9. MoDE achieves new SOTA performance on both benchmarks and outperforms the dense transformer variant of BESO in both settings. Further, MoDE achieves higher performance compared to other policy representation methods such as VQ-BeT and C-BeT. A.6.1 MIXTURE-OF-EXPERTS ABLATIONS Q: How does the Load Balancing Loss influence the Expert Distribution? We analyze how the load balancing loss affects expert distribution across noise levels by training MoDE on LIBERO-10 with varying load balancing weights γLB [0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001] Figure 9 visualizes the resulting expert distributions. With high load balancing loss of 0.1, experts are used almost uniformly across all layers with minor variations in two out of eight layers (Figure 9a). However, this enforced uniformity comes at cost -"

This result suggests that enforcing equal expert usage across noise levels may constrain the models learning capacity. At 0.01, we observe more flexible distribution while maintaining good overall expert utilization (Figure 9b). Within individual layers, expert usage varies from 10% to 40% in various layers. This enables for specialization while preventing any expert from becoming dominant. This configuration achieves the best average performance and provides evidence that moderate specialization benefits the policy most. As we reduce γLB further to range of [0.001, 0.0001], the expert distribution gets worse and the model there is an expert collapse is happening for lb of 0.0001 in several layers (Figure 9c and Figure 9d). These values show, that the load balancing weight is crucial to guarantee good usage of all experts for the model. The lower performance of these models (0.86 for γLB = 0.001 and 0.83 for γLB = 0.0001) suggests that balanced expert participation is important for optimal Diffusion Policy performance. Q: What happens with increased number of Experts? Next, we study the load balancing distribution for models that use more experts. Our experiments with 6 and 8 expert variants on LIBERO-10 reveal challenges in scaling beyond 4 experts. As shown in Figure 10, configurations with more experts consistently underutilize their capacity, with most layers actively using only 4 experts even with increased load balancing regularization (γ = 0.1). These larger configurations also show decreased performance, indicating that 4 experts provides an optimal balance between representation capacity and learning efficiency. We hypothesize that additional experts impair the models ability to learn effective representations from image and language inputs while maintaining noise-level specialization."

We analyze MoDEs behavior with topk=1 routing, both with and without shared expert, using 4 experts total. As visualized in Figure 11, topk=1 configurations struggle to maintain balanced expert utilization, typically collapsing to using only two of the four available experts. While this configuration shows only modest performance degradation on LIBERO-10, its impact is more visible on the challenging CALVIN ABC benchmark, where the average rollout length drops from 3.34 (topk=2) to 2.72 (topk=1). These results highlight the importance of expert interpolation across noise levels, with topk=2 providing the necessary flexibility to blend expert specializations for optimal performance. Q: What expert distribution patterns emerge for different noise levels? Finally, we analyze the different experts loads for various noise levels of our biggest model after pretraining on diverse robotics data. Detailed results are shown in Figure 12. Our analysis of the expert distribution reveals several key insights about how the model learns to organize its mixture-of-experts architecture: Noise-Level Specialization Experts specialize between high-noise (σ1-σ7) and low-noise (σ8-σ10) regimes, particularly visible in L4 where E3 and E0 show distinct high activation patterns in different noise regimes Clear transition point around σ8 where expert utilization patterns shift, most evident in L4 and L5 with stark changes in expert activation Smooth handoff between denoising phases, exemplified in L7 where expert activations gradually transition across noise levels Layer-wise Organization Early layers (L0-L4) show distinct expert specialization, particularly visible in L4s strong alternating expert patterns Middle layers (L5-L7) demonstrate more distributed expert utilization, shown by more balanced activation patterns Later layers (L8-L11) return to clearer specialization, evident in L11s distinct expert preferences First layer (L0) shows particularly strong specialization for low-noise scenarios, with clear expert preferences in the final denoising steps Expert Role Distribution Different experts develop specialized roles, most clearly visible in L4 where experts show strong preferences for specific noise ranges Some experts consistently handle high-noise denoising (evident in L3 and L4) while others focus on low-noise refinement (for example in in L7-L8) \"Transitional experts\" emerge in middle noise ranges, particularly visible in L5s balanced activation patterns Model employs different expert combinations across layers, well demonstrated in the contrasting patterns between L4 and L8 Load Balancing Properties Effective load balancing achieved across experts, particularly visible in the distributed patterns of L5-L7 No single expert dominates across all noise levels, as shown by the varied activation patterns in each layer Smooth transitions between noise regimes, most evident in the gradual activation changes in L4 and L5 These findings provide strong evidence that MoDE effectively partitions the denoising process across its experts, with each expert naturally specializing in different phases. The emergence of this organization without explicit supervision supports the effectiveness of our architectural choices and routing strategy."

The y-axis indicates the log-scaled token count, displaying the frequency of tokens routed to each expert within that layer. The color gradient indicates the proportion of tokens assigned to each expert, where darker colors represent higher usage. A.7 EXTENDED RELATED WORK MoE in Robotics. In the context of robotics, MoE models are used in many settings without being combined with transformer architecture. Several works use mixture of small MLP policies, that focus on different skills in Reinforcement Learning (Obando-Ceron et al., 2024; Celik et al., 2022; 2024) or for robot motion generation(Hansel et al., 2023; Le et al., 2023), another body of work utilizes combinations of small CNNs robot perception (Riquelme et al., 2021; Mees et al., 2016). Further applications include learning multimodal behavior using mixture of Gaussian policies (Blessing et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a). Despite the extensive usage of MoE in many domains, no prior work has tried to utilize MoE together with Diffusion Policies for scalable and more efficient Diffusion Policies. Transformers for Robot Learning. Transformer models have become the standard network architecture for many end-to-end robot learning policies in the last few years. They have been combined with different policy representations in the context of IL. One area of research focuses on generating sequences of actions with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models (Bharadhwaj et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023). These action-chunking transformer models typically use an encoder-decoder transformer as policy architecture. Several Diffusion Policies, such as Octo (Octo Model Team et al., 2023), BESO (Reuss et al., 2023), ChainedDiffuser (Xian et al., 2023) and 3D-Diffusion-Actor leverage transformer model as policy backbone. Another direction of research treats behavior generation as discrete next-token predictions similar to auto-regressive language generation (Touvron et al.,"

C-Bet, RT-1, and RT-2 use discretized action binning to divide seen actions into k-classes (Cui et al., 2023; Shafiullah et al., 2022; Brohan et al., 2022; Zitkovich et al., 2023), while VQ-BeT (Lee et al., 2024a) learns latent actions with residual Vector Quantization. Several works have shown the advantages of using pre-trained LLM or VLM as policy backbone, which are then finetuned for action generation (Brohan et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Collaboration et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). None of the recent work considers using any Mixture-of-Expert architecture for policy learning. MoDE is the first architecture to leverage MoE architecture combined with diffusion for behavior generation."
