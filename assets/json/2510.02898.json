            "content": "Image captioning is one of the most representative tasks in vision-language understanding and has reached incredible accuracy thanks to the availability of pre-trained vision-language backbones and large paired image-text datasets. In its basic formulation, captioning model takes full image as input and autonomously decides which elements must be described and up to what degree. To enable user guidance and produce more targeted descriptions, some previous works proposed region-level captioning methods (Johnson et al., 2016; Cornia et al., 2019), which take as an additional input spatial indication e.g., bounding boxes specifying which image regions have to be described and, possibly, in which order. These region-level captioning methods require expensive manually labeled data to fully supervise the model. Indeed, each sequence or set of bounding boxes for given image should correspond to manually written ground-truth caption describing those objects. This fully supervised solution does not scale properly. In this paper, we propose perspective shift that enables us to perform region-level captioning with arbitrary spatial granularity from single image patch up to the entire image in zero-shot fashion, i.e., without requiring any form of image-level or region-level supervision. Specifically, instead of relying on the idea that the subject of captioning method is the image then potentially conditioned on set of sub-regions we instead build on two straightforward yet powerful ideas: i) the simplest element that we could caption is patch, the atomic element of an image representation in modern architectures based on vision transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), and ii) we can easily aggregate multiple patch representations to produce descriptions for arbitrarily large and also potentially not contiguous image regions. We present Patch-ioner, zero-shot captioning framework implementing these ideas. Our formulation offers maximum flexibility in zero-shot captioning tasks, producing models that effortlessly generate captions for various aggregations of"

            "content": "image patches, ranging from individual patches to larger image regions, up to providing caption for the entire image. Despite the powerful perspective change that defines the patch as the new captioning unit, the problem is now entangled in simple yet critical question: how can we craft model able to provide patch-level captions without relying on any direct patch-level ground truth supervision? In the last years, large pre-trained vision-language foundation models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023a) solved many downstream tasks in zero-shot or even trainingfree configurations. In particular, contrastively learned vision-language representations enabled impressive results in zero-shot settings in image classification (Radford et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2022), open-vocabulary detection (Zhou et al., 2022; Minderer et al., 2023), and segmentation (Ghiasi et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2023), or text-image retrieval (Kordopatis-Zilos et al., 2025). Image captioning, however, cannot directly employ CLIP machinery at inference time to generate text, given that CLIP is inherently discriminative and not generative approach. Only recently, image captioning models became zero-shot by decoupling image encoding where pre-trained discriminative models like CLIP are used to create proper image and text representations from the actual generative module. This is the case for models like Nukrai et al. (2022); Li et al. (2023b); Gu et al. (2023); Zeng et al. (2024); Fei et al. (2023); Yan et al. (2025); Zeng et al. (2025); Tewel et al. (2022); Su et al. (2022), which i) employ CLIP to leverage shared vision-language semantic space, and ii) train text decoder on solely text samples to recover the text back from the CLIP textual feature. This requires nothing more than pre-trained contrastive model and large set of sole text samples to craft powerful captioner. In this paper, we show that our framework can generalize this core idea and that, under this formulation, many zero-shot captioners, paired with the right components, can be easily restructured to perform zero-shot region-based captioning. Therefore, we identify and study in detail the most critical components of this novel zero-shot region-based captioning framework. Particularly, we focus our attention on the pre-trained vision-language contrastive backbone, which should be able, unlike CLIP, to create meaningful patch representations. To this aim, we largely explore DINO-based (Caron et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2024) variants, having better localized capabilities than CLIP. We further expand the study of our framework, addressing multiple modality-gap mitigation strategies that help the text decoder to be trained only on text without having access to paired image-text features, as well as studying different patch aggregation methods. By studying existing components and employing vision backbones able to output patch-level meaningful representations like DINO, we show that we can enable many zero-shot captioners to reach state-of-the-art or comparable results in many zero-shot captioning task variants requiring captioning sub-parts of the entire image dense captioning (Johnson et al., 2016), region-set captioning (Cornia et al., 2019), up to the standard image captioning (Tewel et al., 2022) where the region to caption extends over the entire image. To better showcase the effectiveness of our framework in extreme patch-based captioning scenarios, we also introduce the zero-shot trace captioning task, which requires generating caption for region within an image specified by mouse trace. To summarize, we propose the following contributions: a) We reformulate captioning by shifting perspective from the image-to-caption approach to patch-to-caption one, unifying local and global tasks in Patch-ioner, single framework which does not require region-level supervision, b) we repurpose existing models to work within this novel framework, by analyzing the role of the key components, with special attention to the vision backbone, c) we show the performance of these models on four zero-shot captioning tasks that span different region granularity, from captioning few patches to the whole image, showing the effectiveness of the proposed perspective shift proposed by our framework despite its overall simplicity."

First, we extract language-aligned dense patch embeddings from the image using VLM. Given region, we select the underlying patches and aggregate their features to obtain region representation. Finally, we obtain the region caption by applying zero-shot text decoder, that is a) conditioned on the latent region representation, b) trained on text-only data, and c) equipped with mechanism to handle the modality gap present in vision-language common spaces. This enables regional captioning without requiring region-level supervision. B. By aggregating patch-level features from arbitrary image regions, we can flexibly handle multiple captioning tasks across spatial granularities in unique model. due to misalignment between local visual patches and fine-grained semantics (Zhong et al., 2022; Ranasinghe et al., 2023; Bica et al., 2024). On the other hand, visual-only self-supervised models (SSM) like DINO (Caron et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2024) excel in local semantic modeling but lack bridge with language. Recent works like SILC (Naeem et al., 2024) and DINO.txt (Jose et al., 2024) attempt to get the best of both worlds by combining DINOand CLIP-like training objectives, aiming to obtain language-aligned dense representations. INViTE (Chen et al., 2024) modifies CLIPs visual encoder by zeroing the attention weights from each patch to all the others in the last layers, leading to more semantic patch features. DenseCLIP (Rao et al., 2022) and RegionCLIP (Zhong et al., 2022) extend CLIP with additional region-level supervision. RegionCLIP leverages region-proposal network to construct region-text pairs from image-text datasets, while DenseCLIP introduces pixel-to-text matching loss to strengthen the alignment between local regions and textual concepts. Other methods instead exploit already existing VLMs and SSMs to get the same properties with minimal or no training: Talk2DINO (Barsellotti et al., 2024) connects language to the DINOv2 space by mapping CLIP textual representations to DINOv2 patches. ProxyCLIP (Lan et al., 2024) instead leverages DINOs attention maps to improve the local properties of the CLIP visual embeddings of patches. Zero-shot Image Captioning methods rely mostly on global CLIP representations to guide text generation. Early-guided decoding methods take CLIP visual features as input and introduce adaptation techniques to reduce the visual-textual modality gap (Liang et al., 2022). DeCap (Li et al., 2023b) projects CLIP visual features into more text-aligned space using memory of texts as basis, while CapDec (Nukrai et al., 2022) and CLOSE (Gu et al., 2023) inject noise during text-only training to enable decoding also from the CLIP visual space. To improve the generation ViECap (Fei et al., 2023), MeaCap (Zeng et al., 2024), MERCap (Zeng et al., 2025) and EntroCap (Yan et al., 2025) leverage external knowledge to condition the decoding together with the CLIP image representation. Late-guided decoding methods instead use CLIP as scoring or optimization signal rather than direct input. ZeroCap (Tewel et al., 2022) leverages CLIP gradients to steer the cached context during"

However, all the above approaches rely on global representations, which are not well-suited for capturing localized semantic details, making them suboptimal for patch-level or region-level captioning in zero-shot settings. Region-level Captioning comprises several tasks in which models are asked to produce natural language descriptions based on sub-parts of an image. They pose additional challenges as naively captioning the cropped regions or feature maps often induces loss of the global context of the image and, thus, misinterpretation of the region. For this reason, zero-shot solutions to this family of problems are still underexplored. For controllable captioning (Cornia et al., 2019) the generation of an image caption controlled by set or sequence of regions and dense captioning (Johnson et al., 2016) the localization and captioning of salient regions of an image state-of-the-art solutions like CAG-Net (Yin et al., 2019), GRiT (Wu et al., 2024), ControlCap (Zhao et al., 2024), and FlexCap (Dwibedi et al., 2025) provide good performance but need supervision with ground-truth boxes. Recent works (Guo et al., 2024), (Hua et al., 2025) moved towards the direction of arbitrary regions captioning exploiting region-level supervision, and the Localized Narratives dataset PontTuset et al. (2020a) comprising images, timed captions, and timed mouse tracks provide the ingredients for evaluating captioning also at trackor patch-level. We propose unique framework to tackle captioning at various granularities, from imageto patch-level, in zero-shot setting."

            "content": "Learned region fusion requires regional data. Traditional regional captioning (Johnson et al., 2016; Dwibedi et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2024) follows an early injection of region specification in the model. Formally, given an image and region R, the region caption is modeled as = D(I, R). Such models require region-caption annotations and often use dedicated models or losses per captioning task or granularity. step forward can be moved by introducing formulation which disentangles image encoding and postpones region specification, defining = D(ψ(I), R), where ψ(I) provides visual representation of the image independent of the region R, and performs late region selection and text decoding. In order to avoid training the whole pipeline using region-level labels, we further decompose the decoder module D() into two distinct modules: parameter-free fixed aggregation aggR of patch-level representations, and an actual text decoder ϕ() not directly conditioned on regions R, so that = ϕ(aggR(ψ(I), R)). We will detail these two factorized components in the following paragraphs. Parameter-free patch aggregation. Let RHW 3 be an image split into non-overlapping patches of size . Each patch is encoded with vision backbone ψv, yielding dense grid of patch-level embeddings = ψv(I) = {vi} D, where vi RD. Assuming that ψv(I) extracts this spatial grid of patch embeddings, region definition selects subset of patch features that we aggregate to obtain the region embedding vR = aggR(ψv(I)). We describe this aggregation as vS = (cid:80) iS wivi, where is the set of indices of patches that underlie the region, and wi are aggregation weights. While several aggregation functions can be considered (e.g., uniform, gaussian, attention-based), we found that the specific choice has limited impact in regional captioning (see SM8) and report results with mean aggregation (wi = 1/S). Using set operator as aggregation gives us the flexibility to aggregate arbitrary sets of patches, and thus, define regions as boxes, masks, traces, single patches, or full-image grids. Empirically, we also find that not all ψv are suitable to extracting patch-level meaningful visual representations; transformer architectures pretrained with dense local contrastive objectives (such as DINO) are significantly more robust at the patch level, as validated in 4.2. Zero-shot decoding. We train text decoder ϕ : RD using prefix language modeling approach, where the decoder reconstructs caption from its text embedding ψt(t). If ψt(t) is aligned to the visual encoder ψv(I), we could directly decode the visual embeddings using text-only decoder trained on text-only data. In such case, we can finally decode the region representation into natural language caption = ϕ(vR). However, the assumption that ϕ() can digest features from ψv(I) while being trained to reconstruct features from ψt(t) is often too optimistic due to the"

To obtain decoder applicable to visual embeddings, we experimented with two mitigation strategies for this gap. The first strategy, following Li et al. (2023b), introduces projection step at inference that maps visual features into the text subspace using memory of text embeddings. The second, inspired by Gu et al. (2023) and Nukrai et al. (2022), trains the decoder under input perturbations, encouraging robustness so that it can directly process visual embeddings. We analyze the effects of the modality gap mitigation strategies in SM9. Overall, our formulation offers three main advantages: a) it is zero-shot by design, in the sense that it only requires image-level textual descriptions to be trained and does not require paired image-text samples to train the text decoder, b) any region (e.g., whole image, box, mask, free-form trace, single point) is addressed identically, supporting modular, general-purpose regional captioning pipeline, and c) our method requires only single forward pass of the vision backbone to extract patch features for an entire image, which can then be reused to caption multiple regions without rerunning the full pipeline for each one."

This simple formulation unifies several existing region-level captioning tasks, which differ only in how the relevant patches are selected, allowing us to address them without task-specific modifications. In the following, we describe the tasks considered in our evaluation and their induced patch selections. Image Captioning involves generating single caption that describes the entire image. To achieve this, we derive global representation vI = avgi(vi) by aggregating the feature embeddings of all patches {vi} within the image I. Dense Captioning requires locating salient regions in an image and generating their descriptions. Following defined evaluation protocols (Johnson et al., 2016), we focus on captioning already defined boxes, effectively removing the localization subtask, which can be tackled using additional regionproposal models. Given bounding box and the set SB of indexes of patches that intersect with B, we obtain the representation of the region vB = avgiSB (vi). Region-set Captioning consists of generating single caption for multiple regions within an image, where each region is specified by distinct bounding box. Given an image and set of bounding boxes = {B1, B2, . . . , BK}, we define SBk as the set of patches that intersect with the k-th bounding box in B. To represent the entire set of regions, we aggregate the feature embeddings from all selected patches across all bounding boxes, which results in combined region-level representation vB ="

We build benchmark for Trace Captioning exploiting Localized Narratives (Pont-Tuset et al., 2020b) dataset in which annotators vocally described objects in images while moving the mouse pointer over the described object. The dataset provides temporal annotated voice transcriptions and mouse traces for the images of many standard captioning datasets. We took the labeled COCO (Lin et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015) with splits defined in Karpathy & Fei-Fei (2015) and Flickr30K1(Young et al., 2014) test subsets to build the trace captioning evaluation datasets. We split long traces and transcriptions for each image into sentences, and we discard the parts of the traces that are not temporally located between the start and the end of each sentence. We discarded noisy sentences such as the ones describing image properties (The image is blurred, the image is edited, ...) and rewrote each sentence removing uncertainties typical of voice descriptions in more concise and caption-like style through few-shots prompted LLM (LLama 3 Dubey et al. (2024)). After annotation cleaning, 51 COCO images resulted without clean sentences and were discarded.

Specifically, before decoding, the region representation is projected into the text embedding space as similarity-weighted linear combination of memory elements, vproj = α with α = softmax(cid:0) 1 τ v(cid:1), where = [m1, . . . , mN ] stores the text embeddings mj = ψt(tj) and τ > 0 controls the sharpness of the weighting distribution. This choice enables us to be directly comparable with other works using the same architecture in the all the following experiments, besides also performing the best among the tested zero-shot decoder methods (see SM9). In SM8, we also study how the choice of the memory bank affects the captioning performance, providing an upper bound to metrics. Table 1 shows that backbone effectiveness in our framework is closely tied to capturing fine-grained local semantics. Standard CLIP performs poorly, indicating that its patch tokens lack the spatial detail needed for our tasks (Mukhoti et al., 2023; Ranasinghe et al., 2023; Bica et al., 2024). Backbones that strengthen CLIP local representations, such as INViTE and DenseCLIP, achieve stronger results, supporting our hypothesis. The best performance comes from DINOv2-based models, including DINO.txt and Talk2DINO, with the latter emerging as the most effective encoder. This underscores the importance of semantically rich patch-level features for high-quality region-level captions. For this reason, we show results using Talk2DINO as the default backbone in subsequent experiments."

            "content": "regions. To rigorously quantify the benefit of our Patch-ioner framework, in Table 2, we compare against both state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioners and adapted baselines: (i) state-of-the-art whole-image zero-shot captioners in their standard setting or applied to region crops, simulating regional captioning by isolating local content, and (ii) region-supervised encoders, thus outside our no-region-label setting, that leverage mask-based (AlphaCLIP, Sun et al. (2024)) or crop-based (RegionCLIP, Zhong et al. (2022)) attention coupled with the same zero-shot decoder, allowing them to attend to specific regions. This design ensures that our evaluation covers the strongest available baselines for both image-level and region-level zero-shot captioning. Note that we do not compare with large multimodal models tackling regional understanding and captioning, such as Guo et al. (2024); Hua et al. (2025), as they are outside of our assumptions on the available supervision by training on region-level data. In addition to our strongest model (i.e., Talk2DINO with the memory-based mitigation strategy), we also report other combinations that express existing zero-shot captioning approaches (CLOSE (Gu et al., 2023), CapDec (Nukrai et al., 2022), VieCap (Fei et al., 2023), and MeaCap (Zeng et al., 2024)) but replacing the original CLIP backbone. Specifically, CLOSE and CapDec can be expressed by choosing the noise-injection mitigation strategy and using the standard decoder pipeline described in 4.2. The same applies to ViECap and MeaCap, although with the addition of extra knowledge in the text decoding step: ViECap uses external entity-aware prompts, while MeaCap leverages also structured concept retrieval from knowledge base. We use two datasets for each task COCO-derived dataset and an additional dataset such as Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017) or Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014). Figure 6 shows qualitative results. Patch-centric captioning excels in local, fine-grained tasks. In the trace and dense captioning tasks, which emphasize local visual content, our patch-centric framework significantly outperforms all baselines across metrics. For trace captioning (Table 2, first group), our patch-based formulation outperforms whole-image captioners and crop-based adaptations. Models relying on global CLS representations fail to capture the precise objects and attributes under the trace. Even AlphaCLIP, that is region-supervised backbone that can be naturally applied to traces, lags behind, underlying intrinsic limitations of the pretrained CLIP backbone. Dense captioning shows similar trend (Table 2, second group), with our models outperforming baselines. For this task, we report crop-based adaptations for DeCap, ViECap, and MeaCap, as they provide stronger baseline with respect to the same models applied to the global CLS (see Table 4 in SM). Although isolating regional content, these models discard broader contextual cues that are crucial for coherent dense descriptions. Patch aggregation extends seamlessy to context-aware captioning. On region-set captioning (Table 2, third group), our models once again achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming both zero-shot baselines and region-supervised models. Note that the region-set captioning task tends to align more closely with image-level captioning rather than strictly focusing on localized regions (see Figure 6 and Figure 7 in SM), as regions are intended to control an image-level caption3. Thus, global models also tend to perform well on those tasks, showing narrower gap with respect to our new state of the art. By aggregating patch embeddings from arbitrary and possibly disjoint sets of regions, the model produces coherent and contextually rich captions that align with the collective semantics of the chosen areas. In contrast, whole-image methods, including ViECap and DeCap, cannot naturally incorporate regional cues, limiting their effectiveness in this setting. Importantly, our patch-based aggregation even surpasses AlphaCLIP, which relies on explicit mask supervision. Patch-centric models deliver comparable performance on whole-image captioning. In wholeimage captioning (Table 2, fourth group), our results remain competitive with the strongest zero-shot captioners but are slightly behind dedicated image-centric architectures such as MERCap (Zeng et al., 2025) and EntroCap (Yan et al., 2025). For this task, we report the performance of our models using an attention-based weighting, when helpful, as it usually performs marginally better than the standard average patch aggregation and thus represents the best available model for this task and reaches the smaller gap with state-of-the-art models (see SM8). Notably, adding structured external knowledge or filtered retrieval (as in ViECap or MeaCap) on noise-based decoders improves fluency 3This is expected since the ground-truth captions in the COCO Entities dataset originate from the image-level annotations of COCO, as stated by Cornia et al. (2019)."

            "content": "We introduced Patch-ioner, novel zero-shot captioning framework that shifts from an imagecentric to patch-centric approach, enabling caption generation for individual patches and arbitrary aggregations without any region or even image supervision. We rely on the strong spatial awareness of DINOv2, whose local image patches have been effectively bridged with the text modality. Thanks to the disentangled training of the decoder network, this flexible and scalable method sets the new state of the art on various regional captioning tasks, including dense and region-based captioning, as well as our newly proposed trace captioning. Despite its simplicity, results show that our patch-centric approach can effectively bridge the gap between local and global understanding in image captioning, providing unified framework for multigranularity captioning tasks in zero-shot setting. Moreover, our models require single backbone forward pass to caption multiple regions, facilitating practical viability in interactive applications. Limitations and Future Work. Despite strong zero-shot performance, our model still lags behind fully supervised, task-specific approaches. The contextual scope of each patch is fixed by the backbone and is not adjusted to meet the user intents. On top of that, the modality jump introduces noise that can cause hallucinations. Future work could incorporate weak supervision, e.g., image-level"

We set the hyperparameters of the projection mechanism as in DeCap (τ = 0.01), and use the AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.01. Training proceeds for 10 epochs with learning rate of 105 and batch size of 64. comprehensive overview of the framework operating in the DeCap setting (with the projection mechanism as modality gap mitigation strategy) is provided in Figure 3. For the external knowledge-based captioning models we performed training of 15 epochs with batch size of 80 captions on the same GPT2-style textual decoder using learning rate of 2 105 and gaussian noise variance of 16 103 to replicate the experimental settings of Fei et al.

            "content": "We briefly summarize here the characteristics of the vision-language models we tested in our framework. CLIP (Radford et al., 2021): foundational model that learns shared embedding space for images and text through contrastive learning. While being the most used model for global image-text alignment, its patch tokens are known to lack strong spatial and fine-grained semantic information. The input resolution of its training is 224 pixel. DenseCLIP (Rao et al., 2022): fine-tuned version of CLIP that incorporates pixel-text matching loss to enhance the models ability to understand local regions. The official implementation input resolution is 640 pixel for the ViT-B/16 version. INViTE (Chen et al., 2024): This method modifies CLIPs vision transformer to bring patch tokens in the text space by disabling the self-attention mechanism. It employs the same visual encoder of CLIP, trained at 224 pixel input resolution. ProxyCLIP (Lan et al., 2024): model that leverages the local understanding of DINO backbone to improve CLIPs patch-level representations. It achieves this by replacing the attention maps in CLIPs final layer with DINOs attention maps, effectively transferring DINOs fine-grained spatial awareness to the CLIP embedding space. The DINO ViT-B/8 version was tested with images at 296 pixel resolution, while the DINOv2 ViT-B/14 at 518 pixel. DINO.txt (Jose et al., 2025): This model builds upon frozen DINOv2 backbone, adding learnable transformer blocks on top. It is then trained with contrastive objective against text encoder to align both global and patch-level representations with language. The DINOv2 backbone was trained at the resolution of 518 pixel. Talk2DINO (Barsellotti et al., 2024): This model creates bridge between the CLIP and DINOv2 embedding spaces. It trains projection to map CLIP text embeddings into the DINOv2 patch space, using DINOv2s highly meaningful attention maps to identify and align with the most relevant patches during training. The DINOv2 backbone was trained at the resolution of 518 pixel."

            "content": "Figure 3: Memory-based Patch-level captioning. Given an input image, we first extract dense patch-level representations using vision transformer backbone. For selected patch, we apply the projection-based mechanism introduced by Li et al. (2023b) to mitigate the modality gap and align its representation with the text embedding space. Finally, the transformed embedding is fed into text decoder trained on text-only corpus, generating zero-shot caption for the patch. Patch Aggregation. tion functions for merging the vi in selected set of visual patches: In cases where we are not captioning single patch, we test different aggregaa) uniform, the average box patch representations; b) gaussian, for rectangular configurations of contiguous patches i.e., either the full image or bounding box; we consider weighted average of patches representations where central patches weigh more; specifically, we assign to each patch (a, b) coordinates in uniform square grid [1, 1]2 (i.e., the top-left and bottom-right patches have (1, 1) and (1, 1) coordinates, respectively), and weight of e(a2+b2) in the average, and c) attention, weighted average of box patches representations, with patch weights defined as the average attention map of the last layer of ψv. Input Resolution. For patch-based captioning, we followed Talk2DINO Barsellotti et al. (2024) and used an input image resolution of 518x518, obtaining 37 14x14 patches per side when using the Talk2DINO backbone. The original DeCap Li et al. (2023b), ViECap Fei et al. (2023), MeaCap Zeng et al. (2024) implementations uses the CLIP B/32 backbone with 224x224 input images with 7 patches per side. We also tested with the CLIP B/16 backbone, resulting in 14 patches per side at 224x224 resolution, and with 592x592 input image size, to obtain the same number of patches as in our framework (37 per side). We report results of these additional configurations for all baselines: DeCap, ViECap, and MeaCap. While the main paper reports only the best configuration per task and model, in this section, we report and discuss the results of all the tested configurations. We perform these tests on COCO-derived datasets and on VG v1.2 for dense captioning. We highlight the rows in the tables corresponding to the configurations reported in the main paper. Trace Captioning. Table 3 reports trace captioning results. We did not apply the gaussian weighting scheme for this task, as the sparse discontinuous traces often do not identify rectangular region needed to apply this scheme. We notice that a) the simple average of the trace patches provides the best performance in our framework b) as expected, using the CLIP B16 backbone, that extracts finer patches, improves over the standard CLIP B32 backbone used in the baseline methods, and c) resolutions higher than 224 only marginally improve performance for baselines in this task. Dense Captioning. Table 4 reports the results of the dense captioning task. For our framework, changing the weighting strategy does not cause significant performance changes. The best baselines are the ones Region-based, which consist of applying the captioners to the CLS tokens of image crops specified by the bounding boxes (e.g., DeCap@224 Crop). The difference between the CLIP B/16 and B/32 versions is usually small or negligible. Region-Set Captioning. Table 5 shows the results in the region-set captioning task on COCO Entities. The gap between zero-shot image captioners and our frameworks captioners narrows in this task due to the more global nature of it, which requires the model to produce caption for the whole image while focusing on certain regions. Also in this task, the choice of weighting strategy only marginally affects the performance of the models in our framework."

Image Captioning. In Table 6, we report the results of standard zero-shot image captioning. In addition to the already described weighting schemes, we test one additional configuration for our framework that is central patch, where the decoding is applied to the central patch of the image. We can observe that the most effective strategy for the image captioning task is attention. This is coherent with results from Barsellotti et al. (2024), where they suggest the attention-weighted patch means to use Talk2DINO for global tasks such as image-text retrieval. Memory Bank. Considering that in the memory-based model of our framework (that is similar to Li et al. (2023b)) we tackle the modality gap through projection based on collection of texts, we tested how much the selection of the texts in the memory bank influences performance. In Table 6, we also report the results obtained by that model when in its memory bank there are also ground-truth captions of the test set (rows marked with GT Memory). This provides sort of upper bound to performance when varying the text collection used as memory. We observe that in this configuration, the performance only slightly improves (+0.5%), indicating that the model is robust to the choice of the memory bank."

Additionally, we include in our comparison baseline with no modality gap mitigation (no mitig.), to highlight the benefits brought by each strategy. Training with Noise. Various works Gu et al. (2023); Nukrai et al. (2022) proposed zero-shot image captioning solutions based on noise injection during the training of the text decoder. Through this strategy, the trained decoders are more effective in understanding semantic representations, even when those are not coming from the text modality. To implement this strategy in our framework, we trained the textual decoder on the same collection of captions as for the memory bank-based configuration. We adopted Talk2DINO Barsellotti et al. (2024) textual space for the decoder input space, which is aligned to DINOv2 Oquab et al. (2023) with registers Jose et al. (2024). Following the setting of Gu et al. (2023), we added Gaussian noise with σ2 = 0.08 to the textual embeddings while leaving the other parameters unchanged (as defined in 6). In the next paragraphs, we report and compare the results for each task of Talk2DINO within our framework with the memory bank (Memory) and with the training with noise (N oise). In Table 7, we compare the two modality gap mitigation strategies across multiple captioning tasks, and also report the performance of baseline without any mitigation (no mitig.). The baseline consistently underperforms compared to both the Memory and oise configurations, indicating that, like other contrastively learned image-text encoders Liang et al. (2022), Talk2DINO is also affected by the modality gap. These results highlight the importance of explicitly addressing this gap to"

For Trace Captioning, the Memory method is slightly more effective in the semantic metric RefPAC-S, while the oise variant achieves marginally better scores in CIDEr, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and BLEU@4, with minimal gap between the two approaches. In Dense Captioning, the Memory model consistently outperforms the oise model across all metrics. Similarly, for Region-Set Captioning, both methods achieve strong results, but the Memory method shows clearer advantage, particularly in tasks closer to the patch level. Finally, in Image Captioning, the performance gap between the two architectures narrows, especially on the Flickr30k test split. In this scenario, the Memory method performs significantly better when applied to the CLS token, whereas patch aggregation produces comparable results. However, the metrics reveal conflicting trends across different datasets. Chosen Strategy. Based on the observed results, we selected the projection-based approach (Memory) as the primary strategy for overcoming the modality gap in our framework. While the noise injection method (N oise) yielded competitive performance across multiple tasks, the Memory method demonstrated superior performance in dense captioning and region-set captioning, as well as clear advantage when applied to the CLS token in image captioning. Given these trends, and considering the stability of the projection-based approach across different evaluation settings, we adopted Memory as the default configuration for our framework."

            "content": "We construct our Trace Captioning dataset from the Localized Narratives dataset Pont-Tuset et al. (2020a). This dataset consists of mouse traces and their corresponding speech transcriptions, where annotators describe objects in images while moving the mouse pointer over them. The initial dataset samples include timestamped mouse traces and are composed of multiple sentences that thoroughly describe the trace, with the generated descriptions following the order of the mouse movement. However, our task does not require strict temporal coherence. Instead, we aim to generate single, concise caption that describes the specific area covered by the localized trace, rather than multi-sentence description. To achieve this, we split the descriptions into individual sentences and align the traces accordingly. We then refine the traces by removing intermediate periods caused by transitions between sentences, which often occur when the annotator moves to different region of the image. Specifically, we trim each trace by removing the first and last 15% of points, eliminating these transitional segments. Furthermore, we refine the captions by prompting the Llama3 8B model to rephrase the sentences, removing vague or subjective phrases such as \"there is,\" \"we can see,\" or \"on the left of the image,\" and replacing them with concise, objective descriptions that refer specifically to the region covered by the trace. This rephrasing is crucial to ensure that each caption adheres to the standard format of image-captioning datasets and focuses only on the precise part of the image that the trace corresponds to. The LLM also helps identify and remove irrelevant sentences (e.g., \"the image is blurred,\" \"the image is edited\"), which are then discarded along with their associated traces from the final benchmark. Figure 4 shows the full prompt used to guide the Llama model in refining and cleaning the descriptions. Figure 5 illustrates how the initial narrative samples are transformed into final trace captioning samples through the process of trace splitting and caption rephrasing."

Note that the first rows of Figures 6 and 7 contain also qualitative results for single patch captioning, for which we do not have annotated data to report quantitative results. As can be noticed in Figures 6 and 7, the Region-Set Captioning task tends to align more closely with image-level captioning rather than strictly focusing on localized regions. This is expected since the ground-truth captions in the COCO Entities dataset originate from the image-level annotations of COCO, as stated in Cornia et al. (2019)."
