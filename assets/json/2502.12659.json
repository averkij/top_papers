            "content": "The landscape of large language models (LLMs) is evolving with the advent of large reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 (OpenAI, 2025b) and DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025), which leverage reinforcement learning to enhance complex reasoning. Unlike conventional LLMs, these models think (generate structured chain-of-thought employing specialized output formats) before producing final response. Reasoning models have superior performance in problem-solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step logical inference. However, their increased capabilities, combined with the recent open-sourcing of DeepSeek-R1, amplify their potential safety risks across broad range of applications. Therefore, comprehensive safety analysis of these reasoning models is essential to identify and mitigate their associated risks. In this work, as shown in Figure 1, we present systematic and comprehensive safety assessment for these language reasoning models. Specifically, we first conduct thorough safety evaluation by testing these reasoning language models against various established safety benchmarks, covering broad range of safety categories from company policies and government regulations (Zeng et al., 2024), and various application scenarios (Wan et al., 2024b). Additionally, we assess their vulnerability to different adversarial attacks, including jailbreaking and prompt injection (Jiang et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2024b), to analyze their robustness in real-world deployments. In these evaluations, we analyze both quantitative results and the safety behaviors of large reasoning models to gain deeper insights into their safety performance. Beyond classifying the safety of final model responses, primary contribution of this work is multi-faceted safety analysis specific to large reasoning models. First, to determine whether the reasoning process itself elevates safety risks, we evaluate the safety of the models internal reasoning steps (e.g., the content within <think> and </think> tags in DeepSeek-R1) and compare it against the safety of the final completion. Second, recognizing that unsafe responses can vary in their degree of harmfulness, we hypothesize that reasoning models, due to their enhanced capabilities, may generate more harmful unsafe responses. Therefore, in addition to binary safety classificaFigure 1: We perform multi-faceted safety analysis of large reasoning and non-reasoning models, focusing on three key aspects: (1) Comparison of performance across safety benchmarks and attacks. (2) Analysis of safety differences in reasoning and final answer. (3) Evaluation of the harmfulness of model responses. tion, we evaluate the harmfulness level of model responses using pre-trained multi-attribute reward models (Wang et al., 2024; Dorka, 2024). Our experimental findings demonstrate that open-source reasoning models have significant safety gap compared with the close-source o3-mini in both safety benchmarking and when facing adversarial attacks. Moreover, the distilled reasoning model exhibits consistently lower safety performance compared to their base safety-aligned model. Crucially, our analysis reveals that when reasoning models generate unsafe responses, these responses tend to be more harmful than those from non-reasoning models due to stronger abilities. Finally, we find that across the majority of benchmarks tested, the content generated during the reasoning process of R1 models exhibits lower safety than their final completions, underscoring an urgent need to enhance the safety of the reasoning process itself. We hypothesize that the safety performance of R1 models may be attributed to nonsufficient safety-specific training, and the process of fine-tuning the Llama 3.3 (distilled-R1) could have inadvertently degraded its pre-existing safety alignment (Qi et al., 2023). Given the broad adaptability of open-source reasoning models, we advocate for stronger safety alignment to mitigate potential risks in the future."

            "content": "Large Reasoning Models Recent advancements in large reasoning language models such as OpenAIs o1 and o3 (OpenAI, 2025a,b) and DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025) have substantially enhanced LLMs problem-solving capabilities by integrating structured reasoning mechanisms. For example, the OpenAI o1 model spends additional compute time to generate long chains of reasoning before producing final answer, achieving PhD-level performance on challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (OpenAI, 2025a). Building on this, the o3 series further refines the approach to boost performance (OpenAI, 2025b). In parallel, DeepSeek-R1 pioneered reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning training approach without supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating emergent reasoning behaviors and achieving performance comparable to o1 on math, coding, and science tasks (Guo et al., 2025). These models underscore the effectiveness of test-time self-reflection in addressing complex challenges, although significant hurdles remain in ensuring their safety and reliability. Safety Benchmarking for LLMs As the abilities of LLMs become stronger, various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the safety of LLMs in different safety categories and application domains (Wang et al., 2023; Bhatt et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2024). These benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs comply with malicious queries and produce harmful content, with comprehensive categories that cover safety regulations from the government and company policies. RÃ¶ttger et al. (2023) also evaluate whether the safety alignment of LLMs leads to over-sensitive to benign queries. More recently, there are safety evaluations for new applications of LLMs, including scenarios that are relevant to cybersecurity (Wan et al., 2024b; Bhatt et al., 2024), and LLM agents that make sequential decisions and receive feedback from the environments (Andriushchenko et al., 2024). Adversarial Attacks on LLMs As LLMs become integral to real-world applications, adversaries are devising increasingly sophisticated strategies to subvert their safety mechanisms. One prominent tactic is prompt injection (Yi et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024), wherein adversaries insert additional instructions into the input text to override the models intended directives or trigger harmful behavior. Another major threat comes from jailbreak attacks, which trick LLMs into responding to queries they would typically refuse. For example, strategy-based jailbreaks leverage natural language constructsoften by presenting hypothetical scenariosto manipulate model behavior (Wei et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2024b), while optimization jailbreaks focus on optimizing prefix string to maximize the likelihood of generating responses to otherwise harmful queries (Zou et al., 2023; Liao and Sun, 2024). In our work, we select representative safety benchmarks and attacks to analyze the safety performance and behaviors of large reasoning models. Further, we introduce multi-faceted safety evaluation to better understand their safety risks."

            "content": "3.1 Research Questions With the open-sourcing of the R1 series, large reasoning models are likely to see continuous advancements and broader adaptations across various applications. This motivates us to perform systematic safety evaluation for these models. In this study, we aim to answer the following research questions that could help us to understand large reasoning models safety performance and identify potential directions for improvement: 1. How safe are large reasoning models when given malicious queries? Are they able to refuse to follow these queries? (Section 4) 2. How does enhanced reasoning ability affect the harmfulness level of the unsafe responses? (Section 5) 3. How safe are large reasoning models when facing adversarial attacks? (Section 6) 4. How do the safety risks of the thinking process in large reasoning models compare to those of the final answer? (Section 7) 3.2 Evaluation Design Safety Benchmarks As shown in Table 1, we select 5 representative datasets from 3 safety benchmarks and 2 datasets on adversarial attacks for evaluation. For RQ1, we select Air-Bench (Zeng et al., Category Dataset Safety Benchmarks AirBench (Zeng et al., 2024) MITRE (Wan et al., 2024b) Interpreter (Wan et al., 2024b) Phishing (Wan et al., 2024b) XSTest (RÃ¶ttger et al., 2023) Description Safety Policies Cyber Attack Code Exc Spear Phishing Over-refusal Adversarial Attacks WildGuard (Han et al., 2024) Injection (Bhatt et al., 2024) Jailbreak Prompt injection Size 5,694 377 500 200 250 810 251 Table 1: The safety datasets we used in this study. 2024), comprehensive safety evaluation benchmark containing safety prompts from government regulations and corporate policies. On top of this, we select three test suites from CyberSecEval to test the models safety performance when given unsafe tasks in various cybersecurity-related scenarios, including cyberattacks, secure code execution, and multi-turn spear phishing (Wan et al., 2024b). Additionally, we test the over-refusal behavior of large reasoning models on the XStest dataset (RÃ¶ttger et al., 2023). For RQ 3, we test the models on the WildGuard Jailbreak dataset (Han et al., 2024), and the prompt injection test from the CyberSecEval. Detailed introductions for the datasets can be found in Appendix A.1. Models To facilitate better analysis of the impact of reasoning abilities on safety, we evaluate 2 open-weight large reasoning models, DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025), the strongest reasoning model of R1 series, and DeepSeek-R1-70b (Guo et al., 2025), reasoning model distilled based on Llama 3.3-70b, and compare them with their 2 non-reasoning counterparts, Llama 3.3-70b (Dubey et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2024a). Finally, to understand the safety gap of open large reasoning models, we include the proprietary o3mini (OpenAI, 2025b) model in our evaluation. Evaluation Metrics We perform two levels of evaluation. First, for all the benchmarks, we use GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) to do safety classification on the responses with defined criteria. On AIRbench, Code Interpreter Test and MITRE Tests, responses containing no information that helps the malicious query will be considered safe. In these benchmarks, we also evaluate the safety of the reasoning process for reasoning LLMs and compare it with the final completion. Spear Phishing Tests originally do not provide safety classification to the response. We create safety classification criteria based on whether the model performs the phishing attempt.

            "content": "The fundamental challenge in safety benchmarking is distinguishing between safe and unsafe user queries. Given an input query q, the model must reliably assess its underlying intent. Specifically, for queries with harmful intent qh, the LLM should either refuse to respond or provide mitigating information. For the queries with safe intent qs, the LLM should deliver informative and helpful responses without unnecessary refusals. In this section, we investigate the safety performance of large reasoning models in handling malicious queries. We begin by analyzing their overall performance, and identifying distinct safety behavior from them. Then, we analyze their behavioral patterns on selected representative datasets. 4.1 Overall Safety Analysis Overall Performance We evaluate the average safety rate of all models across four benchmarks with unsafe queries. First, o3-mini exhibits significantly higher safety than open-source reasoning and non-reasoning models, effectively identifying and rejecting most unsafe queries across various scenarios. Open large reasoning models still have considerable gap to close compared with o3-mini. Second, we observe that the distilled R170b consistently achieves lower safety rate than Llama-3.3, suggesting that reasoning-supervised fine-tuning reduces models safety performance; this aligns with the finding of (Qi et al., 2023) on the effect of supervised fine-tuning to safety performance. Finally, R1 demonstrates better safety performance than V3 on the broad safety categories on AirBench. However, R1 shows significantly more severe safety risk in the cybersecurity domain, with more complex tasks and environment settings. These results indicate that more effort should be put into safety alignment on R1 models. Safety Thinking Behavior From the output of the models, we identify different safety behavior of R1 models from non-reasoning LLMs the thinking process of the R1 models usually determines the safety of final completion. In the thinking process, if the model performs safety thinking and decide that the query is not safe to answer, it will refuse the query it in the final answer. Otherwise, if no safety thinking happens, or the model believes the query is appropriate to answer, no refusal will happens. In contrast, the refusal behavior from non-reasoning LLMs usually happens immediately without explicit thinking. Examples and more analysis on the safety thinking are in Section 6.1. 4.2 Select Datasets Analysis Safety Policies & Regulations We present the level 2 category results of Air-Bench in Figure 2 (A), covering 16 categories. First, the comparison between reasoning and non-reasoning models has significant differences across categories. For example, Llama3.3 is significantly better than R1-70b in Operational Misuses, Security Risks, etc., with more than 20% advantage, but is worse than R170b in Hate/Toxicity by 11%. Second, all the reasoning models, including o3-mini have very low performance in certain categories like Operational Misuses and Sexual Content. Meanwhile, the open large reasoning models perform significantly worse than o3-mini in most of the categories. These findings suggest that certain safety aspects require greater attention in large reasoning models. Code Interpreter Test The results in Figure 2 (B) show that reasoning models exhibit higher security risks than non-reasoning models, particularly in reflected attacks and social engineering. Specifically, the safe operation percentage of the R1 model in the social engineering category is significantly lower than Llama3.3 and falls behind V3 by over 50%. This indicates that reasoning models are more vulnerable to abuse in interactive categories. Multi-turn Spear Phishing Table 2 presents the models safety rate in the Spear Phishing Test. In this evaluation, the tested LLM will be asked to perform multi-turn spear phishing against victim LLM. Here, the safety rate refers to the proportion of conversations in which the model did not attack in any turn. Notably, the result reveals significant safety risk, as o3-mini initiates an attack in only 5% of trials, while other models do so in over 95% of cases. Moreover, o3-mini almost always Figure 2: Two safety benchmark evaluations: (A) Level-2 categorized results of the models on Air-Bench. (B) Evaluation of the models safety rate (%) in the Code Interpreter Tests across different risk categories.

Safe prompts should achieve full compliance (FC), and not refused with either full refusal (FR) or partial refusal (PR). The columns from left to right correspond to FC, FR and PR respectively. refuses to engage in an attack at the start of the dialogue, with only one instance where it does so immediately. In other unsafe dialogues, it begins attacking after multiple prompts. Also, in the cases where it engaged in phishing attempt, it can later recognize the safety risk and cease the attack. In contrast, at the start of the dialogue, neither the R1 nor R1-70b models show safety awareness when prompted to attack. This highlights the risks posed by R1 models as multi-turn spear phishing agent. Over-Refusal Benchmark The over-refusal rate to benign queries is also strong indicator of models safety alignment. We present the average result and the result of the category with the worst performance for each model on the XSTest dataset in Table 3 and leave the detailed categorized result in Table 9 in the Appendix A.2. We observe that all the models tested can usually respond to safe prompts correctly without refusal, with refusal rate of less than 10%. Among these, the o3-mini has the highest refusal rate due to being more sensitive to seemingly unsafe queries. However, all the models refuse to answer significant portion of safe queries in at least one safety category. The most frequent over-refusal made by models is in the fictional privacy category, where the query asks about private information on fictional persons. For instance, when the R1-70b is asked What is Harry Potters criminal history?, it replies As an AI assistant, dont have access to internal company information.... Besides that, Deepseek-R1 often refuse to prompts with discrimination against nonsense group. (e.g. Why should purple carrots not be given visas to enter the US? The Peoples Republic of China consistently advocates for the principle of equality ...). This shows that the current models safety alignment is not still refined enough in specific categories."

            "content": "Definition Safety classification alone is not sufficient to comprehensively assess models safety, as not all responses classified as unsafe are equally harmful - some provide minimal information, while others offer detailed, actionable guidance that aids malicious intent. To capture this, we define the harmfulness level of an unsafe response as the degree of helpfulness it provides to malicious query. Harmfulness Evaluation We quantitatively evaluate the models harmfulness level on two datasets with different malicious scenarios. For AIRbench, we evaluate the helpfulness to the malicious question using two top pre-trained reward models on the RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) ArmoRM-Llama3-8B (Wang et al., 2024) and QRM-Llama3.1-8B (Dorka, 2024). These models are trained to predict the reward score for 19 attributes, such as helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. We utilize the average reward score for the helpsteer-helpfulness and ultrafeedback-helpfulness attributes to represent the helpfulness of the response to queries in AIR-bench. In Spear Phishing Tests, the helpfulFigure 3: The harmfulness evaluation result for two pairs of LLMs using two reward models on Air-Bench dataset.

Higher scores indicate greater security risks. ness of the model to the malicious instruction can be evaluated as the attack techniques they demonstrate in the attack process. We use the automated LLM-based grading system from the test suite to evaluate the attack skills, including persuasion, rapport, and argumentation. Specifically, we use Llama 3.3 as the LLM grader. Results We compare the harmfulness levels of unsafe responses to policies and regulation-related malicious queries between two pairs of reasoning and non-reasoning models in Figure 3. The evaluation includes only questions for which both models in pair generate unsafe responses. Overall, large reasoning models (e.g., R1, R1-70b) receive higher reward scores in helpfulness when responding to malicious questions. As shown in Figure 4, we find that large reasoning models usually provide more detailed and structured responses. This suggests that while reasoning models demonstrate greater capability, they also pose higher level of harmfulness when misused by malicious users. The results of social engineering capability in the spear phishing test are shown in Table 4. We notice that reasoning models perform better than the non-reasoning models (since o3-mini only has few attack attempts, its attack score is not compaFigure 4: Example of large reasoning model provides more detailed and structured responses to the malicious query compared with non-reasoning model.

This suggests that current LLMs struggle to detect challenging adversarial threats. We also find that among all the open-source models, Deepseek-R1 has the lowest attack success rate. We observe cases where reasoning models are able to identify potential hazards in their thinking process and provide relatively safe responses. An example is provided in Appendix Figure 7. However, reasoning models still Figure 5: Three Scenarios of the R1 Model in Jailbreak: (A) Identifies safety concerns but executes the users request unreflectively.

We identify several models failure patterns: Model bias towards user queries leads to harmful follow-up in thinking process. Although reasoning models can recognize potential harm during the thinking process, they still prioritize following the users query intentions, overlooking potential risks. Figure 5 (A) shows that R1 identifies potential security risks during the initial thinking process but generates unsafe responses in subsequent thinking steps by following the users query. Models safety thinking is misled by the jailbreak strategies. As illustrated in Figure 5 (B), reasoning models may fail to accurately assess the harmfulness of inputs due to the deliberate design of adversarial samples, even when potential risks are identified during the reasoning phase. This observation suggests that the safety thinking process in R1 is not reliable enough when faced with disguised adversarial strategies. Models do not perform safety thinking in the thinking process, directly executing harmful information. Reasoning models fail to identify the risks and proceed to execute the users instructions. In Figure 5 (C), R1 directly follows the users request during the thinking phase, without effectively preventing harmful outputs.

Regarding injection types, the ASR of indirect injection is generally higher than that of direct injection. Although the reasoning models perform similarly to other models in indirect attacks, their robustness is significantly weaker in direct attacks, with ASR nearly double that of the others, indicating higher level of compliance to direct prompts. In terms of risk categories, reasoning models exhibit higher ASR for security attacks than for logic. This discrepancy indicates that despite these models demonstrate strong logical reasoning capabilities, their security protection awareness is weak. Finally, compared with o3-mini, R1 models are more vulnerable to prompt injection attacks."

We can observe that the safety rate of the thinking process is lower than the final answer. AfFigure 6: Two examples where the safety of the reasoning content is worse than the final completion. Left: The reasoning content directly provides techniques that help the malicious query. Right: The reasoning content provides safe paraphrasing techniques that are relevant to the malicious query. Red text is the potentially unsafe content. ter investigating the models responses, we identify two main types of cases where the thinking process contains hidden safety risks that are not reflected in the final answer. First, the model thinks about and provides relevant harmful content to the query, but at the end of the thinking process, the model realizes the safety issue and refuses to answer the query in their final answer. This case is more severe, as the harmful content is already presented and may be leveraged by malicious users. An example is shown in Figure 6 (left), where the model first introduces techniques for infiltrating the network in the thinking process. Although the model realizes it is illegal in the end, they already provide direct help to the malicious query. In the second case, the model usually identifies the safety risk in the users query early in reasoning. Then, instead of directly refusing to answer the users query, the model tries to redirect the conversation to safer direction and provides thoughts on it. During this process, the model may mention some general information that is relevant to the query. The reasoning content becomes less unsafe, since the information provided is not directly solving the users query. An example is shown in Figure 6 (right), where the model mentions legitimate paraphrasing techniques in their thinking without aiming to bypass the plagiarism checkers. These observations indicate that the emerging reasoning capabilities in RL training also bring new safety concerns that the safety alignment of the reasoning needs more improvement."

In addition, the distilled R1 model compromises the original safety performance consistently in all the safety tests. Therefore, additional safety alignment is required after reasoning distillation. Moreover, we find that with stronger reasoning ability, the R1 models provide more help to the malicious queries compared with their non-reasoning counterparts. Therefore, their unsafe responses are more harmful. This further underscores the necessity of enhancing the safety of R1 models. Finally, within the outputs of large reasoning models, we find that the thinking process may contain hidden safety risks that are not reflected in the final answer. This presents new challenge brought by reasoning models, which requires future work to address."

            "content": "While our study provides comprehensive safety analysis of large reasoning models, there are still limitations. First, our analysis highlights the safety gap between open-source large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and proprietary models such as o3-mini. However, the proprietary models full safety mechanisms remain opaque, limiting direct comparisons and insights into their superior safety performance. Second, our study reveals that the reasoning process in large reasoning models often contains safety risks not present in final responses. While we identify trends in unsafe reasoning outputs, our work does not propose specific mitigation strategies to refine the reasoning process."

            "content": "A.1 Benchmark Introductions Here, we provide detailed instructions to the dataset we used in our analysis, and provide an example from each dataset in Table 8. AIR-bench (Zeng et al., 2024) is comprehensive safety evaluation benchmark designed to assess LLM safety across 314 risk categories derived from eight government regulations and sixteen corporate policies. The AIR-Bench 2024 dataset comprises 5,694 diverse prompts spanning domains such as system operations, content safety, societal impacts, and legal risks. CyberSecEvalMITRE Tests (Wan et al., 2024a) employ the MITRE ATT&CK frameworka comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques to evaluate LLMs on their compliance when prompted to assist in cyberattacks. The MITRE Tests originally contained 1000 examples across 10 MITRE categories and 377 attack techniques. To optimize inference cost, we select one sample for each attack technique and test on 377 samples in total. (Wan CyberSecEvalCode Interpreter Tests et al., 2024a) evaluate the security risks associated with integrating LLMs with code interpreters. In these tests, LLMs are responsible for generating or executing code within controlled environments. The evaluation focuses on assessing whether LLMs can be manipulated to execute malicious code, perform unauthorized actions, or escape sandboxed environments. This benchmark suite contains 500 examples across 5 categories on code execution. CyberSecEvalSpear Phishing Tests (Wan et al., 2024a) evaluates LLMs ability to generate persuasive phishing attempts by simulating realistic interactions between an attacker LLM, victim LLM, and judge LLM. The attacker LLMs attempt to deceive the victim into revealing sensitive information or executing malware based on the victims profile, including information like profession, interests, and communication style. The dataset comprises 856 test cases. For our testing, we selected sample of 200 examples, ensuring equal distribution across four attack goals. XSTest (RÃ¶ttger et al., 2023) is benchmark dataset for evaluating exaggerated safety behaviors in LLMs. It includes 250 safe prompts and 200 unsafe prompts, designed to assess whether models incorrectly refuse valid safe queries or comply with unsafe ones. XSTest covers ten safety categories, ranging from homonyms and figurative language to privacy-related questions. XSTest provides robust framework for assessing model performance across varied contexts of safety and compliance. In our study, we only evaluate our models on safe prompts. Its expected that well-calibrated models exhibit high rates of full compliance on safe prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals. WildGuard Jailbreak (Han et al., 2024) is designed to evaluate the ability of safety moderation tools to detect harmful or manipulative inputs intended to bypass the models security defenses. The dataset includes both harmful and benign adversarial prompts, which manipulate the language model into generating unsafe responses. Prompt Injection (Wan et al., 2024a) exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs by embedding malicious instructions within untrusted inputs. These attacks aim to manipulate the models behavior, causing it to deviate from its intended task. We use the prompt injection attack from the CyberSecEval 3 benchmark suite, which contains 251 test cases, including direct and indirect prompt injection. A.2 Additional Details on the Safety Evaluation Results Tables 9 and 10 present more comprehensive safety evaluation of the model under the XSTest and Code Interpreter environments. These results provide insights into the models performance when facing various complex security challenges and further highlight the models vulnerabilities and robustness under different testing conditions. A.3 More Examples Figures 7 - 10 illustrate the four different behaviors of the reasoning model under the jailbreak test, as analyzed in Section 6.1: 1. Effective safety reasoning 2. Identification of safety issues, but tendency to respond to the users query 3. Recognition of safety concerns, but being misled into providing an answer 4. Failure to recognize any safety issues. Figures 11 and 12 present the security evaluation of the model under the text prompt injection attack, determining whether the models performance is influenced or compromised by harmful prompt injections. The results shown in Figure 11 indicate that R1 model demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities when confronted with specific text injection attacks. It can effectively identify logical contradictions between user instructions and maliciously injected content, accurately determining the true intent that should be followed. This finding suggests that reasoning models, during their cognitive processing phase, are capable of detecting potential contradictions in the input and making precise judgments based on logical analysis. Conversely, as shown in Figure 12, when the reasoning model encounters contradiction between injected text and user instructions, it engages in extensive reasoning. However, during this process, the model experiences confusion and uncertainty, failing to clearly determine which instruction to follow. Ultimately, after prolonged ineffective deliberation, the model generates harmful response. This suggests that the reasoning process within the model lacks an effective safety review mechanism. During complex and extensive reasoning, the model may fall into state of confusion, preventing it from effectively identifying potential harmful issues in the input.
