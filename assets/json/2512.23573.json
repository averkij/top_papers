Introduction Recent advances in large generative models have unlocked remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text and images [45, 48]. These models have quickly applied to diverse domains, including embodied intelligence [22, 31], autonomous agents [43, 44], and creative Equal Contribution Corresponding author({lilijun,shaojing}@pjlab.org.cn) Figure 1. Reactive versus proactive moderation pipelines: Reactive guards rely on fixed safety taxonomy, limiting their ability to identify novel risks. In contrast, proactive guard detects emerging risks and infers appropriate OOD category names. The inferred category shown is real output generated by ProGuard. content generation [36, 38]. However, as their capabilities evolve rapidly, the safety mechanisms designed to mitigate risks have lagged behind [4, 7, 26]. This misalignment has led to novel safety challenges, with risks manifesting in increasingly complex and dynamic forms, posing significant threats to the reliability and ethical deployment of these models [19, 47]. To address the increasing safety concerns surrounding large generative models, researchers have explored two complementary approaches: model alignment and external guard models. Alignment-based methods directly adjust the parameters of the base model, enforcing safer behavior, which may lead to potential capability degradaIn contrast, guard models act as external tion [21, 47]. moderation components that evaluate and filter the inputs and outputs of generative models without altering their in1 ternal parameters. This provides modular and scalable alternative for safety control. For example, LlamaGuard3Vision [5] is the first guard model designed for visionlanguage safety moderation and harmful response categorization. GuardReasoner-VL [30] further introduces reasoning stage prior to moderation, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy. However, all existing guard models are reactive, relying on predefined safety taxonomies or policies for decisionmaking. As result, they struggle with emerging or previously unseen safety risks outside fixed taxonomies. In contrast, proactive guards can detect OOD risks and describe the nature of these emerging threats, which is crucial for advancing safety moderation, as shown in Figure 1. Constructing proactive multimodal guard model poses several challenges, including: (1) Significant modality bias: Existing models often excel on text-related risks but struggle with image-related risks due to skewed data distributions [5, 30]. (2) Many models focus on binary safety classification, neglecting more complex tasks such as unsafe content categorization. This limits their ability to generalize and adapt to evolving threats at test time [29]. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, proactive multimodal reasoning-based guard model purely optimized with reinforcement learning (RL). Central to ProGuard is the OOD safety category inference task, where we explicitly encode proactive moderation into the RL objective. The model is provided with intentionally incomplete taxonomies and is encouraged to infer plausible OOD category names. To achieve this, we incorporate synonym-bank-based similarity reward that guides the model toward generating semantically meaningful and human-aligned safety category descriptions. To mitigate modality bias, we design hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy and construct dataset with balanced coverage across modalities, comprising over 87K samples annotated with both binary safety labels and fine-grained harmful categories. Unlike prior works that rely on supervised finetuning (SFT) before RL, ProGuard draws inspiration from the R1-Zero [10] framework and adopts pure RL paradigm to directly incentivize autonomous reasoning, achieving efficient inference without sacrificing moderation accuracy. ProGuard jointly tackles three tasks: binary safety classification, unsafe content categorization, and OOD safety category inference. The OOD safety category inference task enables the model to proactively reason about unseen risks in controlled, taxonomy-agnostic setting. Using online reinforcement learning with multi-task training scheme, ProGuard learns to generalize safety reasoning across tasks. The contributions of this work are as follows: We design hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy and use it to annotate balanced 87K-sample dataset across modalities, mitigating modality bias. We introduce the OOD safety category inference task, moving ProGuard towards proactive safety moderation through synonym-bank-based similarity reward. We propose ProGuard, an open-sourced multimodal trained purely via RL, reasoning without compromising reasoning-based guard model achieving efficient moderation accuracy. 2. Related Work Guard models serve as dedicated moderation components that assess the safety of user inputs and model outputs, preventing unsafe content generation by large models. Early progress in AI safety moderation was driven by industrial APIs such as OpenAI Moderation [32], Perspective [23], and Azure AI Content Safety, which provided effective but proprietary filters. In response, the community developed series of open-source guard models, including LlamaGuard [17], AegisGuard [8], WildGuard [11], and ShieldGemma [46], enabling transparency and reproducibility. Recent work has extended guard models to the vision-language domain [7]. Models such as LlamaGuard 3 Vision [5], LlamaGuard 4, and GuardReasoner-VL [30] moderate both textual and visual inputs, yet their taxonomies and data remain skewed toward text, limiting balanced multimodal safety moderation ability. Another line of research incorporates reasoning to improve guard reliability [24, 49]. GuardReasoner [29] and DynaGuard [14] use chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance binary safety classification, but the reasoning is limited to simple binary decisions, leaving broader generalization and test-time scaling underexplored. 3. Preliminary Let denote target generative model, which can be any model capable of processing and generating textual, visual, or text-image information, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), or image generation models. The vision-language-based guard model is designed to judge the query and optionally the response of by evaluating their safety under predefined taxonomy . The moderation task can be formulated as follows: (cid:40) ˆY = ( ˆYq, ˆYr, ˆYc) = G(Q, R, ), ( ˆYq, ˆYc) = G(Q, ), if provided, otherwise. (1) In this formulation, ˆYq and ˆYr denote the predicted safety labels of the query and the response R, respectively, each taking values in {safe, unsafe}. When both predictions are safe, the model does not assign any safety category, and thus ˆYc = None. When either the query or the response is predicted as unsafe, the guard model additionally outputs 2 Figure 2. Overview of ProGuard. The framework combines moderation task design, multimodal safety taxonomy and balanced safety dataset, and an online reinforcement learning pipeline to build reasoning-enhanced proactive guard model. category prediction ˆYc = ( ˆYood, ˆYs) , which encapsulates both the in/out-of-taxonomy judgment and the corresponding semantic label. It takes an index from the predefined taxonomy when the model finds suitable category, or self-inferred category name when none of the existing categories fit the sample. When only the query is provided, the term ˆYr is omitted. 4. Methodology This section presents the methodology of the proposed ProGuard. Specifically, we first design hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, upon which we construct modality-balanced dataset to alleviate modality bias. Then, we detail the training pipeline for building VLM-based proactive guard model through pure reinforcement learning. The overall training framework is illustrated in Figure 2. 4.1. Multimodal Safety Taxonomy To build an effective multimodal guard model, it is essential to recognize safety risks that manifest differently across modalities. However, existing multimodal taxonomies remain limited in scope and fail to fully capture the diverse and modality-specific safety risks observed in real-world settings. For example, malicious deception primarily arises in textual content, whereas sexual exposure is more prevalent in visual inputs. To address these limitations, we construct multimodal safety taxonomy that explicitly models modality-dependent risk characteristics. Building upon diverse set of existing safety datasets, including Aegis2.0 [9] for text, BeaverTailsV [20] for text-image data, and UnsafeBench [35] for image, we derive hierarchical taxonomy consisting of 11 high-level categories and 28 fine-grained subcategories. The complete taxonomy is provided in Appendix A. 4.2. Balanced Dataset Construction In order to ensure that the ProGuard covers moderation tasks for various generative models, data from both text and image modalities are required. To this end, we collected text-only and text-image question-answer pairs. Additionally, we gathered both real and generated images. We collect question-answer pairs and image data from ten datasets. Specifically, for the text modality, we combine data from GuardReasoner [29], Do-Not-Answer [42], Direct-Refusal [15], MedSafetyBench [12], Aegis1.0 [8], and Aegis2.0 [9]. For the image modality, we obtain both real and generated images from GuardReasoner-VL [30] and T2ISafety [26], as well as real images from LlavaGuard [13]. For the text-image modality, we collect data from BeaverTails-V [20], text-image preference dataset. Since all queries in this dataset are unsafe, we incorporate Llava-CC3M-Pretrain [28], text-image pretraining dataset, as safe data to maintain balance. For each modality, 3 Table 1. Consistency of majority voting across modalities, measured by accepted rate and Fleiss-Kappa agreement. Modality Text Text-Image Image Accepted Rate (%) Fleiss-Kappa Consistency 92.77 0.703 93.29 0.693 92.83 0. we perform similarity-based deduplication to ensure sample uniqueness and mitigate potential risks of data leakage. It is important to note that all data collected here are annotated with safety labels, indicating whether they are safe. Based on the safety taxonomy introduced in Section 4.1, we relabel the existing datasets using open-source LLMs and VLMs through majority voting mechanism. Given an unsafe query Qunsafe, we employ LLMs and VLMs as annotators Fanno to assign labels according to our taxonomy, obtaining Ys = Fanno(Qunsafe). For example, the label C5S1 represents the first subcategory of the fifth category Living Environment Hazards, which is Natural Environmental Risks. In our implementation, each sample is annotated by three models. If the results are either completely consistent or two models agree while one disagrees, the label is retained, otherwise it is discarded. After the data annotation process, we balanced the dataset according to modality and safety, resulting in total of 29,070 text samples, 30,000 text-image samples, and 27,954 image samples, achieving well-balanced distribution. To assess the effectiveness of the majority voting mechanism, Table 1 presents the Fleiss-Kappa consistency and acceptance rate (the proportion of cases where at least two models agree) for majority voting. For all three modalities, the Fleiss-Kappa consistency of the majority voting is around 0.7, and the data acceptance rate consistently exceeds 90%. These results confirm that the majority voting mechanism is highly effective. We additionally conduct human validation study by randomly sampling data across all modalities. To further verify label reliability, we conduct human validation study by randomly sampling 300 instances from the annotated dataset across all modalities. We observe more than 90% agreement between human judgments and the majority voting labels, confirming that majority voting provides reasonable and efficient approximation to human annotation. detailed description of the annotation and validation process is provided in Appendix B. 4.3. Online Reinforcement Learning Post-Training We build upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1], employing an R1-Zero style approach to incentivize reasoning and train it on moderation tasks. 4.3.1. Data Augmentation While expert-designed safety taxonomy address most common risks, they often fail to adapt to dynamically evolving moderation scenarios. To accommodate diverse classification taxonomies, we embed the safety taxonomy into the guard models system prompt and apply category-level data augmentation to enhance the ability of policy comprehension. We employ three main data augmentation strategies to strengthen our proposed taxonomy : Structural granularity augmentation. With random probability, we modify the safety taxonomy embedded in the models system prompt. This prompt will present either single-level (e.g., C1, C2) or two-level (e.g., C1S1, C1S2) classification scheme. This strategy exposes the model to safety policies of varying structural depths, training it to interpret hierarchical taxonomies effectively. Index shuffling augmentation. We randomly shuffle the correspondence between category indices and their descriptions. This prevents the model from overfitting to fixed index-content mappings and encourages it to rely on semantic understanding. Category removal augmentation. We randomly remove certain first-level or second-level categories with random probability. If the ground-truth category remains after removal, the model must correctly predict its index. When the ground-truth category is excluded, the model is required to recognize the out-of-taxonomy safety risk and infer plausible name or description for the risk category. As result, for each training instance we generate unique augmented taxonomy Taug, from which we construct the final training and evaluation datasets D. 4.3.2. Training Process We employ the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) [39] in conjunction with the balanced dataset constructed in Section 4.2 to optimize the models policy for the moderation task. Existing reasoning-based guard models are typically trained through SFT with teacher-provided CoT annotations, which constrains reasoning diversity and often leads to verbose thought generation when combined with reinforcement learning [10]. To overcome these issues, we bypass the SFT stage entirely and adopt pure GRPO training, which enables reward-based autonomous reasoning. This allows the model to self-evolve its reasoning trace through trial and error, focusing on outcome correctness rather than teacher imitation. The optimization objective is formulated as follows: J(θ) = (Q,R,Taug,Y)D,{Ci, ˆYi}G i=1πθold (cid:104) 1 (cid:88) i=1 min (2) (cid:0)Ki, clip(Ki, 1 ϵ, 1 + ϵ)(cid:1)Ai βDKL(πθ πref) (cid:105) , 4 Ki = πθ(Ci, ˆYiQ, R, Taug) πθold(Ci, ˆYiQ, R, Taug)) . (3) In the above two equations, denotes the group size, Ai = rimean(r1,...,rG) represents the estimated advantage, and r1, ..., rG refers to the group rewards. std(r1,...,rG) 4.3.3. Correctness Reward Design The reward function for each sample is defined as: = Iformat (rqur + rres + rcat), (4) where Iformat denotes an indicator of whether the models response adheres to the required output format. Specifthe model must first generate its reasoning proically, cess within the <think></think> tags, followed by the final classification and prediction results within the <answer></answer> tags. rqur and rres denote the rewards for correct safety classifications, assigned as 1 for correct predictions and 0 otherwise. The term rcat is defined as follows: if (Yq = safe Yr = safe) ( ˆYood = Yood), rcat = 0 0.5 + rid cat 0.5 + rood cat else if Yood = false, otherwise . (5) In this formulation, rcat is 0 when both the query and response are safe, or when the OOD prediction is incorrect. Otherwise, base reward of 0.5 is given for the correct in/out-of-taxonomy judgment, and an additional rid cat is added when the sample belongs to the predefined taxonomy. Specifically, rid cat = 0.5 if the predicted category index matches the ground-truth index, and 0 otherwise. 4.3.4. OOD Inference Reward Design We employ sentence transformer [3] to compute text embeddings and measure the semantic similarity between the category predicted by the proactive guard model and the ground-truth category name. In addition, we manually construct synonym bank for each category by providing multiple synonymous expressions. This synonym-based comparison yields smoother and more semantically aligned reward signal, encouraging the model to understand the underlying safety concept rather than overfitting to specific phrasing. The formula is as follow: (cid:40) rood cat = max maxvS sim( ˆYs, v) τmax 2 (1.0 τmax) meanvS sim( ˆYs, v) τmean 2 (1.0 τmean) , (6) (cid:41) , 0 , where denotes the synonym bank corresponding to the ground-truth category. For the predicted word ˆYs from the proactive guard model, we first compute its similarity with 5 each synonym S. Based on both the maximum and mean similarities, we apply two distinct thresholds, τmax and τmean, to determine the reward. Specifically, τmean is set lower than τmax to encourage the model to first approach the correct semantic region through coarse-grained guesses and subsequently refine its prediction toward the precise category. We further demonstrate in Section 5.6 that this reward design exhibits strong consistency with human perceptual judgments. 5. Experiment 5.1. Experiment Setup All experiments were conducted on single machine equipped with eight NVIDIA H200 GPUs. We employed Verl [40] as the training framework for the GRPO optimization process. For the hyperparameters, in Equation (6), τmax is set to 0.7 and τmean is set to 0.6. Detailed GRPO training parameters are provided in the Appendix C. For the evaluation benchmarks, we assess prompt-level binary safety classification using diverse set of benchmark models, including Aegis2.0 [9], HarmBench [33], OpenAI Moderation [32], SimpleSafetyTest [41], ToxicChat [27], WildGuard [11], XSTest [37], BeaverTails-V [20], and LlavaGuard [13]. To evaluate response-level binary safety classification, we employ Aegis2.0, BeaverTails [18], WildGuard, and XSTest. For the unsafe content categorization task, we conduct evaluations across three modalities using the test split of our self-constructed dataset. Additionally, we adopt the labeling standards of Aegis2.0, OpenAI Moderation, BeaverTails-V, and LlavaGuard to assess our models adaptbiliy to OOD taxonomy. All of these evaluation benchmarks are also employed to measure the models OOD safety category inference. Furthermore, we manually construct synonym bank for each category under every benchmark taxonomy, as detailed in the Appendix D. This ensures fair OOD evaluation by incorporating category descriptors that the model has never seen during training. GuardReasoner-8B [29], For comparison models, we include LLM-based guard models (DynaGuard [14], GPT-OSS-SafeGuard [34] , LlamaGuard-7B [17], [25], LlamaGuard2-8B, LlamaGuard3-8B, MD-Judge ShieldGemma-9B [46], WildGuard [11]), VLM-based guard models (GuardReasonerVL-7B [30], LlamaGuard311B-Vision [5], LlamaGuard4-12B), and closed-source models (Gemini 2.5-Flash [6] and GPT-4o-mini [16]). 5.2.

For response classification, while our model performs slightly lower than LLM-based guard models on the text modality, ProGuard-7B ranks second among all VLMbased guard models, maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, in text-image response classification, ProGuard-7B achieves the best performance overall, confirming its robustness in multimodal moderation scenarios. These results collectively indicate that ProGuard maintains balanced and consistent performance across different modalities, without overfitting to any specific input type. This demonstrates the models strong adaptability and effectiveness in diverse safety moderation tasks spanning textual, visual, and text-image inputs. 5.3. Unsafe Content Categorization Results As shown in Table 3, ProGuard series outperforms all LlamaGuard models across both the multimodal safety taxonomy introduced in Section 4.1 and other taxonomies. This improvement can be attributed to the models ability to leverage test-time scaling during reasoning, which enhances its adaptability to complex multi-class classification tasks. LlamaGuard models exhibit notable performance drop on text-image and image modalities, reflecting common limitation of existing multimodal moderation systems that lack explicit modeling of modality-specific safety risks. In contrast, ProGuard is trained under multimodal taxonomy that defines such risks explicitly, enabling balanced and robust classification across text, text-image, and image inputs. However, due to its relatively small parameter scale, ProTable 3. Unsafe content categorization results measured by accuracy.

Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that ProGuard effectively bridges the gap between open and closed models in fine-grained category understanding while preserving efficiency and modality robustness. 5.4. OOD Safety Category Inference Results To evaluate the models capability in OOD safety category inference, we measure its ability to identify and describe risks that fall outside the predefined taxonomy. Specifically, for each benchmark taxonomy, we randomly remove 50% of the categories and assess the models performance in two aspects: (1) detecting whether given unsafe content belongs to an in-taxonomy or out-of-taxonomy category, and (2) generating plausible category inference for OOD cases. We adopt two complementary metrics: (1) F1score, (2) The mean of the reward defined in Equation (6). It is worth noting that, for benchmark taxonomies such as Aegis2.0, we construct dedicated synonym banks for their category names. These synonyms are completely unseen during training, ensuring that the evaluation reflects truly OOD setting. As shown in Table 4, closed-source models such as Gemini 2.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini tend to force-fit unsafe prompts into existing categories, resulting in low F1 scores. In contrast, ProGuard-7B achieves significantly higher F1 scores across all benchmarks, demonstrating better awareness of unseen risk types. However, this task remains highly challenging, as most models still struggle to robustly differentiate out-of-taxonomy cases, indicating that safety understanding in current guard models is far from sufficient. In addition, ProGuard-3B performs comparably to existing closed-source large models, suggesting that smaller models can also achieve performance on par with larger models through fine-tuning. 7 Figure 3. Performance comparison of models trained with different methods across five evaluation tasks. 5.6. Human Alignment Results Figure 4. Human alignment results measured by accuracy. the advantage of reinforcement finetuning in refining reasoning efficiency. inference, Regarding OOD category name both ProGuard-7B and ProGuard-3B achieve performance closely matching that of closed-source models such as Gemini 2.5-Flash across all benchmarks. This demonstrates through reinforcement fine-tuning, even relatively that, small models can acquire large-model-level generalization ability in safety reasoning, producing meaningful and semantically coherent category inferences beyond the training taxonomy. 5.5.

            "content": "To investigate how different training strategies influence the performance of reasoning-based guard models, we compare three approaches: (1) RL on non-reasoning base model, (2) RL after supervised fine-tuning SFT cold start, and (3) RL on reasoning-capable base model. Specifically, we adopt Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the base model and use the VLAAThinker [2] trained from it as the reasoning-capable VLM backbone. To provide valuable supervision signals for SFT, we additionally annotate 2,000 samples from our dataset with reasoning traces using GPT-4o [16]. Figure 3 presents the results of the three models finetuned on our safety moderation dataset across five evaluation tasks. From the overall task-wise performance, each model demonstrates strengths on certain metrics and weaknesses on others, making it difficult to declare single dominant method for safety moderation. However, notable differences emerge in the reasoning length: the SFTinitialized model generates an average of 114.05 thinking tokens, while the model trained from the reasoning-capable VLAA-Thinker produces 66.25 tokens on average. In contrast, the model trained purely with RL requires only 52.07 thinking tokens on average. This indicates that our RLtrained guard can achieve efficient and concise reasoning without sacrificing performance across tasks, highlighting 8 and ˆY 2 Since we use Equation (6) to measure the similarity of model-inferred OOD category names, it is necessary to verify whether the assigned reward aligns with human perception. To this end, we collect the inferred categories ˆYs and their corresponding scores rood cat during training. For each true OOD category, we randomly select two inferred category names ˆY 1 with score difference greater than 0.1, and ask human experts to judge which one better matches the ground-truth concept. This allows us to assess the consistency between expert preference and the reward signal. For each category, we constructed 30 such pairwise comparison tasks. As shown in Figure 4, the agreement between human judgment and reward ranking exceeds 80% across all categories. Since our reward serves as weak supervision signal for guiding both training and evaluation in open-ended scenarios, this result confirms its semantic validity and alignment with human perception, while also supporting the effectiveness of our chosen hyperparameters τmax, τmean, and the synonym bank design. 6. Conclusion We present ProGuard, reinforced-reasoning proactive guard for multimodal safety that can detect and describe unseen risks beyond fixed taxonomies. Trained on modalitybalanced safety dataset, ProGuard demonstrates strong performance in binary classification, unsafe content categorization, and out-of-distribution (OOD) category inference. We believe ProGuard offers preliminary step toward proactive safety systems. Its ability to uncover novel risks and generate interpretable category hypotheses highlights its potential value in downstream tasks, including safety taxonomy expansion, open-ended prompt risk labeling, and risk discovery support. We hope that this work encourages further exploration of proactive safety frameworks that can evolve in tandem with the growing capabilities of generative models.

Training dynamics under modality imbalance. checkpoint of the same training schedule. As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, modalities with fewer samples exhibit larger reward fluctuations during training, although convergence can still be achieved. However, the resulting models show less consistent performance across modalities. When text data are limited, performance drops on text category classification. When text-image data are reduced, the degradation is milder but still observable in text-image category classification. In contrast, when image data are scarce, the model fails almost completely on image safety classification. The balanced model achieves top or near-top results across all tasks, demonstrating that balanced modality sampling leads to more stable reward convergence and uniformly strong performance across modalities. These findings confirm that maintaining modality balance is crucial for achieving consistent and robust safety moderation across multimodal tasks. F. Implementation Details of Reasoning Trace"
