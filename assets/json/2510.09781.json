However, their growing autonomy introduces significant safety concerns (Hua et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025). Malicious actors can exploit these systems, and agents themselves may generate harmful action sequences (i.e., trajectories) due to flawed reasoning or unforeseen environmental interactions. Ensuring the safety of these agents is therefore prerequisite for their widespread adoption, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare (Xu et al., 2025). promising mitigation is guardrail system (Bassani & Sanchez, 2024; Inan et al., 2023)an external monitor that at the pre-execution (i.e., planning) stage prospectively analyzes an agents plan and intervenes before harmful actions are executed. Yet, building robust and generalizable guardrail faces three fundamental challenges aligned with data, model, and evaluation. First, there is critical scarcity of high-quality, diverse data capturing harmful agent behaviors. Real-world unsafe trajectories are rare and hard to collect; manual construction is costly and often lacks the coverage needed"

Second, there is pressing need for powerful and generalizable guardian model that can proactively analyze intended actions; current solutions (Luo et al., 2025a;c; Chen et al., 2025; Chennabasappa et al., 2025; Padhi et al., 2025a) are often narrow in scope or lack the adaptivity required to handle diverse threats and settings, as detailed in Table 3 in Appendix C. Third, existing relevant evaluation benchmarks are ill-suited for the planning stagea crucial pre-execution checkpoint where system can proactively analyze the full plan to intercept risks before any action is taken. Most existing benchmarks (Zhang et al., 2025a;c; Yuan et al., 2024) emphasize execution-time risks, cover limited scenarios and risk types, and are often ad-hoc and environment-specific, whereas planning-stage ones can be more systematic and generalizable since they analyze plans at the reasoning level. Contributions. To address the above challenges regarding data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap, we make the following contributions: 1) synthetic data engine for generating risky agent trajectories (AuraGen), which overcomes data scarcity through three-stage pipeline: (i) synthesizing diverse benign trajectories, (ii) injecting category-labeled risks via principled mechanism, and (iii) applying an automated reward model for quality control. This yields large-scale, highquality, and controllable corpus for training safety models. 2) foundation guardrail (Adapter + Safiron), which consists of (i) unified adapter that normalizes different input formats, and (ii) compact guardian modelSafiron. Given normalized trajectory, Safiron outputs three fields: binary decision (harmless vs. risky), fine-grained risk category, and concise explanation, enabling precise and interpretable interception before execution. Safiron is trained with two-stage recipe from base modelsupervised fine-tuning followed by GRPO-based reinforcementunder broadly explored data recipe that jointly optimizes binary detection and category accuracy with mixed data sources. 3) benchmark for pre-execution (planning-level) safety evaluation (Pre-Exec Bench), built through tool refinement, trajectory generation, and human verification, providing realistic and high-quality assessments tailored for guardian models. We further conduct extensive experiments to map the design space of the guardrail framework the and distill set of best practices for effectively training guardian models. Empirically, adapterSafiron pipeline consistently outperforms both open-weight and proprietary baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, achieving strong balance of detection accuracy, fine-grained categorization, interpretability, and preserved task success, while offering actionable guidance for future research."

            "content": "General Agent Workflow. According to the recent works (Huang et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2025), typical agent operates in loop consisting of several stages: 1) Planning, where it derives the current sub-task from the user query or task description, often breaking it into smaller steps; 2) Tool Invocation or Action Execution, where it selects appropriate tools (e.g., search engines or API calling) or performs direct environment-facing actions (Huang et al., 2024b); 3) Observation of Results, where it collects and interprets outputs or environmental feedback; 4) Internal State Update, where it integrates observations into memory or context to update its reasoning basis; and Task Completion Check, where it either outputs the final result or returns to the planning step if the goal is unmet. Motivation of Focusing on the Planning Stage. Given the agent workflow above, the planning stage is critical intervention point: it is the moment when the agent has produced complete trajectory of intended actions but has not yet executed them. Crucially, this stage reveals the overall plan of the agents behaviorthe full sequence of actions to be takenrather than local snapshot. Leveraging this holistic view enables proactive safety: harmful trajectories can be intercepted before they incur any side effects. By analyzing trajectories as whole, we can assess the agents overall intent, detect multi-step and context-dependent risks, and prevent irreversible harm. Since most agentic systems incorporate planning phase (Hong et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024a; Yao et al., 2023), this intervention strategy generalizes well across architectures and deployment settings. Problem Formulation. We consider an agentic system where an LLM-based Agent, denoted as A, operates within an environment E. The environment is equipped with set of tools, ="

Given user query q, interprets the intent and devises trajectory = (a1, a2, . . . , an) in the planning stage, where each ai is tool invocation from U. The intended process is denoted as = A(q, E, U). The agentic systems we consider are susceptible to generating harmful trajectories (Li et al., 2025; Shi et al., 2025). We define risky trajectory, Trisk, as any action sequence that violates pre-defined safety policies upon execution. Such risks may stem from internal model errors (e.g., hallucinations) or external adversarial inputs. We adopt risk pool (i.e., risk taxonomy) = {r1, r2, . . . , rk} to categorize potential harms. To mitigate these risks, we aim to propose guardrail that intercepts and evaluates before execution. Given , outputs: a) Risk Detection, yrisk {0, 1} indicating whether the trajectory is benign or risky; b) Risk Classification, ytype R{benign} specifying the category of harm if risky; and c) Explanation Generation, e, rationale explaining the risk judgment (e aims to be concise and human-interpretable, sufficient for audit or intervention).

            "content": "A robust guardrail requires comprehensive training dataset covering diverse agent behaviorsincluding risky onesbut currently faces two obstacles: Data Scarcity (harmful trajectories are rare, heterogeneous across systems, and seldom public) and High Annotation Cost (pinpointing risk-inducing steps in long, multi-step trajectories demands expert, labor-intensive labeling). To overcome both, we introduce AuraGen, as shown in Figure 1, synthetic data engine that produces large-scale, diverse, and controllable trajectories spanning wide spectrum of risks for training guardian model. Crucially, AuraGen makes the guardian more flexible and adaptive by enabling systematic expansion of risk coverage and rapid incorporation of new scenarios, ensuring safety across evolving agent ecosystems. Stage 1: Benign Trajectory Synthesis. The synthesis process is initialized with structured metadata profile, denoted as = (E, U, C), which provides the operational context. Here, is the environment description, is the tool information, and represents the constraints (examplied in Appendix F). We employ an LLM as Generation Model, Ggen. This model takes as input to produce both plausible user query and corresponding benign action trajectory Tbenign. This process can be expressed as: (q, Tbenign) = Ggen(M ). The trajectory Tbenign = (a1, . . . , an) consists of actions that safely contribute to fulfilling q. This stage yields complete, benign scenario, encapsulated by the tuple (M, q, Tbenign), which serves as clean baseline for the subsequent stages. Stage 2: Principled Risk Injection. The core innovation of AuraGen lies in its risk injection mechanism. This process is governed by an Injection Model, Ginject, which transforms benign scenario into valuable negative sample. First, risk category is sampled from pre-defined Risk Pool R, and an injection strategy is sampled from the set Sset = {Ssingle, Smulti, Snew, Sbridge}. The Injection Model then takes the full benign scenario as input to generate risky trajectory Trisk that is contextually relevant to the metadata and query: denoted as Trisk = Ginject(M, q, Tbenign, r, S). The strategies in Sset are designed to construct holistic taxonomy of failure modes: I) Single-Step Perturbation (Ssingle): To simulate atomic risks, the most fundamental failure type. This strategy modifies single action ai into harmful counterpart i, resulting in Trisk = (a1, . . . , i, . . . , an). This model isolates errors or simple malicious commands and serves as critical baseline to evaluate the guardrails ability to perform fine-grained, per-action safety checks."

II) Multi-Step Corruption (Smulti): To emulate planned malicious behaviors that require sequence of coordinated steps. This strategy replaces contiguous subsequence (ai, . . . , aj) with new malicious sequence (a l). This challenges the guardrail to move beyond isolated action analysis and perform contextual reasoning. k, . . . , III) New Branch Diversion (Snew): To model catastrophic goal hijacking, where the agent completely abandons its original task. The trajectory is truncated at action ak and new, harmful terminal sequence (a m) is generated, resulting in Trisk = (a1, . . . , ak, m). This mode is essential for testing the guardrails ability to enforce long-term goal alignment. k+1, . . . , k+1, . . . , iV) Bridged Branch Diversion (Sbridge): To simulate sophisticated, deceptive adversaries that attempt to mask their malicious activity. It replaces intermediate actions while preserving the original final action an, leading to the trajectory Trisk = (a1, . . . , ak, m, an). By appearing to fulfill the tasks final objective, this mode provides stringent stress test for the guardrails capacity for holistic path auditing, forcing it to look beyond simple outcome-based checks. k+1, . . . , Stage 3: Automated Quality Assurance. Generating risky trajectories introduces non-trivial challenges in maintaining data quality. related example is: when corrupting an intermediate action ak within trajectory = (a1, . . . , ak, . . . , aN ), how can we ensure that the subsequent actions (ak+1, . . . , aN ) remain valid? In other words, single corruption might steer the state trajectory into an unrealistic direction, producing follow-up actions that would never occur in coherent plan. This is just one examplebeyond causal consistency, synthetic data must also preserve continuity, rationality, and risk alignment to be useful for training. To address these challenges, we employ Reward Model (RM), denoted MRM, for automated quality assurance (its training procedure is described later). The RM acts as multi-faceted critic that evaluates each complete sampleincluding the metadata, user query, and injected risky trajectoryacross five complementary dimensions: Causal Consistency, Postcondition Continuity, Rationality, Justification Sufficiency, and Risk Matching (see Appendix for details). It outputs tuple (s, ) = MRM(M, q, Trisk), where {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}5 is score vector and is optional feedback. filtering policy Πfilter then decides whether to retain or discard each sample, i.e., Πfilter(s, ) {keep, discard}.

In the first stage, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on vanilla model G0 using dataset (generated by AuraGen), obtaining an SFT model GSFT = SFT(G0, D), which acquires basic response patterns. While SFT provides basic detection ability, it struggles with rare or ambiguous risks; reinforcement learning (RL) complements it by optimizing for fine-grained safety objectives. In the second stage, we employ RL to enhance the models ability to classify risks. To construct the RL dataset, we run inference with GSFT on and define Figure 3: The training pipeline of Safiron. Deasy = {(x, y) GSFT(x) = y}, Dhard = {(x, y) GSFT(x) = y}, DRL = DeasyDhard."

            "content": "This is because: directly training on Dhard alone tends to destabilize learning, as the model over-focuses on rare or noisy mistakes and quickly collapses (see Figure 5 and subsection 6.1). In contrast, combining both easy and hard samples into DRL provides balanced training signalanchoring the model on reliable cases while still exposing it to challenging ones. The final guardian model is then optimized as GSafiron = RL(GSFT, DRL, R). Reward Design. The reward function R(ˆy, y) is designed to encourage both accurate harmless/harmful classification and fine-grained risk categorization. It is defined as R(ˆy, y) = 1.0 1.0 0.5 0. if = harmless and ˆy = y, if = harmful, ˆy = and risk category matches, if = harmful, ˆy = but risk category mismatches, otherwise. Here, ˆy denotes the model prediction and the ground truth. Although the explanation is generated, we do not explicitly include its quality in the reward. First, measuring explanation quality typically requires complex evaluation mechanisms (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023)), which would make RL training prohibitively expensive. Second, in our experiments, we observed that as the models risk category classification accuracy improves, the correctness of generated explanations also increases, suggesting that explanation quality can be indirectly enhanced by strengthening risk categorization. Therefore, we rely on SFT to provide initial signals for rationale generation, while RL primarily focuses on detection and classification. RL Algorithm (GRPO). We instantiate the RL stage with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), policy-gradient method that uses group-wise, on-the-fly baseline instead of learned value function. Let πθ denote the Safiron policy and πref frozen reference policy (we take πref = GSFT). For each input x, we sample candidates {ˆyi}K i=1 πθold( x) and compute rewards ri. We form the group baseline b(x) = 1 i=1 ri and advantages Ai = ri b(x), then apply group-wise normalization Ai = j=1)+ε with ε > 0. For compactness, define t=1() and KLi,t(x) KL(cid:0)πθ( x, ˆyi,<t) πref( x, ˆyi,<t)(cid:1). The GRPO Ei,t[] 1 objective is: Std({rj }K (cid:80)ˆyi 1 ˆyi (cid:80)K (cid:80)K i=1 Ai LGRPO(θ) = Ex Ei,t min(cid:0)ρi,t Ai, clip(ρi,t, 1 ϵ, 1 + ϵ) Ai β Ex[ Ei,t KLi,t(x) ] , (cid:1) (cid:105) (cid:104) where ρi,t = πθ(ˆyi,tx,ˆyi,<t) πθold (ˆyi,tx,ˆyi,<t) , ϵ is the clipping coefficient, and β controls the KL strength. Intuitively, GRPO upweights tokens from candidates scoring above the group mean and downweights those below, yielding stable improvements without training critic. Token-level credit assignment. Each sampled ˆyi is short label (possibly with brief rationale). We assign Ai uniformly to all tokens in ˆyi (i.e., Ai,t = Ai) and optimize token-level log-likelihood with end-of-sequence rewards; in practice we use small K, an (optionally) adaptive β to limit policy drift, and standard decoding temperature during rollouts. Compared to training on Dhard only, the group-relative baseline over DRL reduces gradient variance and mitigates collapse while still focusing updates on the most informative mistakes."

The benchmark consists of 1,001 harmless and 671 risky samples (with injected risks). and AgentSafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2025c): their evaluation emphasizes the execution phase and adversarial attacks, underweighting plan-centric, non-adversarial failures (e.g., hallucinated plans). R-Judge (Yuan et al., 2024): many samples are dialogue-style and lack stepwise plans and complex tool interactions needed to assess reasoning quality. OPENAGENTSAFETY (Vijayvargiya et al., 2025) supports only limited tool set. To end these, Pre-Ex Bench introduces novel focus on the pre-execution planning stage. The construction is inspired by R-Judges approach of extending existing datasets; specifically, we build upon the rich and diverse scenarios and tools provided by AgentSafetyBench to ensure broad topic coverage. Before constructing the trajectories, we first perform tool refinement for more detailed tool calling scenarios: we use an LLM to generate fullyspecified, executable function details from the tool descriptions, which are then rigorously verified by human experts for both correctness and functional appropriateness. Stage 2: Diverse Trajectory Generation (Realism, Diversity, and De-leakage). Real-world agentic systems are LLM-driven; thus, using LLMs to synthesize trajectories is not merely convenient but distributionally realistic. To construct challenging and unbiased test set, we employ heterogeneous model pool Mpool of eight open-source LLMs across five developers 1. For each scenario, we first sample benign generator Abenign Mpool to produce stepwise plan Tbenign. We then sample (potentially different) injector Arisk Mpool to inject predefined risk via one of four strategies, yielding Trisk. Decoupling benign and risky generators (cross-model pairing) reduces single-model artifacts and prevents model from attacking its own style. We further (i) stratify sampling so no single model dominates the corpus, and (ii) randomize and paraphrase prompts (lexical paraphrasing, order shuffling, and style changes) to avoid template bias. While these measures already mitigate model-specific artifacts, we acknowledge that LLM synthesis alone cannot fully eliminate bias. Therefore, all trajectory pairs are subsequently subjected to rigorous human verification and debiasing process in Stage 3, which serves as non-LLM arbiter to guarantee reliability. Stage 3: Two-Phase Human Verification and Debiasing. To break the synthetic-to-synthetic loop and eliminate residual biases from Stage 2, all trajectory pairs undergo stringent two-phase human review conducted by domain experts. Phase (quality & validity gate). Each pair (Tbenign, Trisk) is independently assessed by three reviewers for plausibility, coherence, and correctness of risk injection against standardized taxonomy. Only samples with unanimous approval are retained, ensuring high-quality and unambiguous labels. Phase II (redundancy & distribution control). Approved samples are grouped into homogeneous batches (by injection strategy). Experts identify and prune intra-batch redundancies (e.g., repeated narrative structures, near-duplicate risk patterns), keeping one representative per cluster. We then enforce distributional balance across the four strategies (by downsampling as needed). This human-in-the-loop stage explicitly filters out spurious, modelidiosyncratic artifacts and provides the final debiasing guarantee. The details of human evaluation are shown in Appendix L. Importantly, Pre-Exec Bench relates to our guardrail but is not tailored only to it; it is built to facilitate broader research on pre-execution guardrails in the future. 1Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Llama-4-Maverick-17B128E-Instruct, Qwen3-32B, Mixtral-822B, and gpt-oss-20B"

Due to page limits, the formal definitions and mathematical formulations of these metrics are provided in Appendix D. To balance evaluation efficiency and accuracy, we adopt hybrid approach that combines keyword matching with LLM-as-a-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023). Further details are provided in Appendix K.

We use AuraGen to generate around 20k for training (More details are shown in Appendix F). As shown in Figure 7, AuraGens synthetic corpus achieves near-uniform coverage of the four risk-injection strategies (around 25% each). This balanced design is not meant to reflect natural frequency, but rather to stress-test guardrails fairly across diverse failure modes. In addition, the corpus contains user requests of realistic and moderate length (mean 23.10; median 21 tokens) and trajectories with long-tailed complexity (mean 14.77; median 9 actions; maxima about 48). The long-tail arises from scenarios with more complex environments and richer tool combinations, which provide challenging yet plausible cases. Cost & Latency Analysis. detailed analysis is provided in Appendix H. At our average input/output length, generating one sample with GPT-5 costs under $0.02. Given that recent open-source APIs (prices from OpenRouter (OpenRouter, 2025)) are strictly cheaper, their per-sample cost is even lower. We also present latency analysis in the Appendix H, which also demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed guardrail. 6.1 BEST PRACTICE FOR TRAINING GUARDIAN MODEL In this section, we outline practices for training the Safiron, focusing on how data composition and sample difficulty should be organized to achieve stable optimization and strong performance. The ratio of the training set has far greater impact on the model than the sample size. From the trends shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, we observe that as the proportion of harmful samples increases, model performance rises almost monotonically and gradually saturates in the 1:4-1:6 range.

The effect of the ratio is especially larger than that of scale for harmful detection and explanation correctness: moving the harmless:harmful ratio from 3:1 to 1:4 brings about +0.15-0.20 improvement in harmful detection and +0.10-0.15 in explanation correctness, whereas increasing the sample size from 2k to 10k often yields only +0.02-0.05. This explains why in Figure 9, training with 4k samples under the 1:3 or 1:4 ratio still significantly outperforms the results under the 3:1 ratio even after doubling the data. The root of this phenomenon lies in the influence of class priors on the learned decision boundary and gradient signals: when harmful samples are scarce, the model is more prone to benign-by-default bias; conversely, higher proportion of harmful data not only strengthens the ability to distinguish fine-grained risk categories and exposes the explanation module to richer counterexamples. Notably, when the ratio becomes extremely skewed toward harmful (e.g., 1:7 or 1:8), some metrics exhibit diminishing returns or slight declines, indicating that excessive imbalance can harm the overall accuracy. Finally, after five runs with ratios of 1:4 and 1:5, we chose 1:4 as it achieved better balance. Easy samples are indispensable for effective GRPO training, but an excessive proportion of them leads to performance degradation. As shown in Figure 5, introducing easy samples substantially boosts classification accuracy and explanation correctness compared to the w/o easy setting. Without easy samples, the model tends to suffer from catastrophic forgetting (Luo et al., 2023), resulting in unstable optimization and poor overall performance. However, as the ratio of easy to hard samples increases (from 1:1 to 1:3), the importance of hard samples is gradually diluted, which weakens the models ability to learn from challenging cases. 6.2 BASELINE COMPARISON & MODULE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this section, we compare baselines and evaluate the performance of different components within AuraGen and the proposed guardrail. Specifically, we contrast Safiron (without the adapter) against standard LLM baselines. The end-to-end performance of the full guardrail (adapter + Safiron) is presented in the case study section (section 7). Figure 8: Model performance under different sizes of training dataset. Adapter training and evaluation. We synthesize agentic trajectories in various styles using both programmatic methods and LLM-based generation to train the adapter. Full training details are provided in Appendix I. To assess performance, we conduct experiments on the complete training dataset and further examine the adapters generalization ability by removing two specific styles from the dataset. We employ LLM-as-a-Judge (i.e., GPT-4o-mini) to evaluate the correctness of the adapters outputs. As shown in Figure 6, the adapter trained on the full dataset achieves consistently high accuracy across all styles. Even when the Semicolon Single and Bullets styles are excluded, it sustains strong performance on unseen categories, demonstrating robust generalization. Reward model (in AuraGen) training and evaluation. We train and evaluate the reward model (RM) on synthetic data to avoid costly manual labeling, and find strong agreement with human validation (see Appendix G). RM performance is assessed by two metrics: (1) score difference, the total deviation from ground-truth across five criteria; and (2) instability rate, the fraction of criteria"

We show the evaluation results on Appendix G. Using the RM as synthetic-data filter, simple threshold policies (AVG/ALL) underperform on Risk Cat. Acc. and Expl. Corr. (AVG/ALL) underperform on Risk Cat. Acc. and Expl. Corr. (e.g., AVG>2, AVG>1.5; see Table 1), likely discarding useful samples. We therefore train lightweight classifier (SVM) (We chose linear SVM for its simplicity) on Pre-Exec Bench keep/discard annotations, using the vector of per-criterion RM scores as input; this Classifier policy improves most metrics (Cls. Acc. 0.951, Risk Cat. Acc. 0.602, Expl. Corr. 0.537), suggesting the RM encodes structured patterns that benefit from supervised guidance. We include all details in Appendix G. Safiron significantly surpasses both proprietary and open-weight models across all four evaluation metrics, demonstrating its superiority as the most balanced solution. As shown in Table 2, compared with leading proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o, as well as open-weight models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-72B, Safiron consistently achieves much higher classification accuracy, stronger risk categorization, and better explanation correlation, while maintaining competitive harm detection accuracy. Notably, the GRPO version of Safiron provides the most stable and well-rounded performance, making it the final choice for our study. While proprietary models like GPT-5 achieve near-perfect harmful detection, they suffer from worse other metrics, effectively over-flagging or exaggerated safety (Rottger et al., 2023) and limiting usability. Safiron balances detection with fine-grained categorization and explanation quality, which are crucial for interpretable pre-execution safety. Existing popular guardrails are not yet well-suited for the Pre-Exec Bench, underscoring the necessity of our proposed guardrail. We additionally present the results of LLamaFireWall (Chennabasappa et al., 2025) and LLama-Guard-3-8B (Grattafiori & the Llama Team at Meta, 2024) in Appendix B. The findings indicate that these widely used guardrails fail to deliver satisfactory performance on the Pre-Exec Bench (as they focus on content moderation tasks, such as detecting toxicity, violence, and hate speech)thereby underscoring the necessity of our proposed guardrail."

            "content": "Figure 10: Two typical agentic systems. While our earlier evaluations quantify pre-execution safety on isolated prompts and controlled plan fragments, real deployments increasingly rely on agentic systems that orchestrate multiple roles and long-horizon workflows. In such settings, (i) risk accumulation can amplify seemingly minor local defects into globally hazardous outcomes; (ii) authority gradients (e.g., expert roles or mission director) can induce deference, allowing single risky suggestion to cascade; and (iii) threat surfaces expand from single-message inputs to multiple injection points distributed across stages. To assess whether pre-execution guardrail remains effective under these deployment-specific pressures, we conduct an end-to-end case study within two representative multi-agent paradigms. We instantiate multi-agent environments inspired by MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024) and AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), chosen to contrast two widely used orchestration patterns: (Left Figure) Linear pipeline. Roles (e.g., planner solver reviewer) communicate in feed-forward chain; each roles output becomes the next roles input until final action list and response are produced. We inject risks at the generation stage of each role. Although an individual perturbation may be subtle, composition over depth can aggregate multiple lowgrade issues into overtly unsafe trajectories. (Right Figure) Expert-driven workflow. Designated experts provide guidance that is synthesized by MISSION DIRECTOR. Here, risks are injected at both the expert and MISSION DIRECTOR stages. Because expert outputs carry elevated credibility and the director concentrates decision authority, even single-shot (or simultaneous) injections can produce disproportionately dangerous behaviors, capturing qualitatively different failure mode from the linear setting. Figure 11: Results of the proposed guardrail on the case study. We show the results with (i.e., w/) and without (i.e., w/o) the adapter. To approximate realistic deployment failures and reduce overlap with earlier synthetic stressors, we adopt human expertdriven risk injection protocol at the trajectory level. We first generate benign trajectories with AuraGen, then have two human experts independently edit these trajectories into harmful variants (details in Appendix L); each harmful sample is cross-validated by the other expert. This yields balanced set of 50 harmful and 50 harmless trajectories for each agentic system. While the dataset is small by necessity (manual curation), it suffices to highlight qualitatively distinct failure modes. Relative to prior sections, this design introduces distributional shift (human-curated edits), multi-point injections (per role), and authority-biased cascades (expert/director), enabling us to test whether the guardrails pre-execution checks generalize beyond single-agent, single-turn evaluations. More framework and orchestration implementation details are provided in the accompanying code in the supplementary materials. As shown in Figure 11, our proposed guardrail achieves strong performance in real-world multiagent scenarios, reaching over 90% classification accuracy when equipped with the Adapter. The Adapter further yields consistent gains across all three evaluation metrics (classification, risk categorization, and explanation), underscoring its importance in handling heterogeneous trajectory formats. While performance is somewhat lower than on the Pre-Exec Benchprimarily due to the distributional shift introduced by human-injected risks and multi-point role-level perturbationsthe"

Ensuring the safety of LLM-based agents is crucial as their autonomy and deployment scale (Wang et al., 2025b; Huang et al., 2024c). Recent works have addressed this through benchmarks, methodologies, and adversarial analyses. Evaluation benchmarks such as Agent-SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2025c), R-Judge (Yuan et al., 2024), SafeAgentBench (Yin et al., 2025), and RealSafe (Ma, 2025) have systematically measured safety across diverse scenarios. For protective methodologies, TrustAgent (Hua et al., 2024) employs an explicit agent constitution; GuardAgent (Xiang et al., 2025) uses secondary auditing agent with knowledge reasoning; AgentSpec (Wang et al., 2025a) provides customizable runtime enforcement; and Causal Influence Prompting (Hahm et al., 2025) mitigates risks via causal interventions. Specialized efforts such as SafeScientist (Zhu et al., 2025) and prioritizing safeguards over autonomy (Tang et al., 2025) target scientific contexts. In adversarial research, Evil Geniuses (Tian et al., 2024) demonstrates sophisticated bypass techniques, while AgentAuditor (Luo et al., 2025a) achieves near-human audit accuracy.

Metas open-source Prompt Guard toolkit enables rule-based prompt filtering and evaluation pipelines for production systems (Meta AI, 2023). data-free methodology trains off-topic detectors without real user logs, thereby easing the deployment of guardrails before launch (Chua et al., 2025). In robotics, RoboGuard fuses temporal-logic synthesis with an LLM root-of-trust to keep physical agents safe under jailbreak attacks (Ravichandran et al., 2025). Some recent works focus on the safety of agentic systems (Luo et al., 2025a;c; Chen et al., 2025; Xiang et al., 2025; Chennabasappa et al., 2025); however, as summarized in Table 3, they still fall short in (i) comprehensive risk coverage, (ii) keeping human cost low for evaluation and data construction, (iii) rapid adaptivity to new scenarios and emerging risks, (iv) input generalization across heterogeneous formats/modalities, and (v) explanationcost trade-offs suitable for real-time monitoring. AgentAuditor (Luo et al., 2025a) covers broad set of risks but relies heavily on human annotation and is not designed for low-latency guardianship, leading to high cost and low efficiency in explanation. AGrail (Luo et al., 2025c) demonstrates high adaptivity through adaptive safety-check generation and test-time adaptation, though its reliance on curated benchmarks and moderate input flexibility keeps both human cost and input generalization at the medium level. SHIELDAGENT (Chen et al., 2025) achieves medium risk coverage but provides strong explanation signals with efficient rule circuits, hence scoring high on the explanationcost trade-off, while its adaptivity depends on continuous rule engineering. GuardAgent (Xiang et al., 2025) excels at adapting to new tasks by uploading new functions, yet its benchmarks involve expert annotation and its explanations are code-based, resulting in higher human cost and only medium real-time suitability. Finally, LlamaFirewall (Chennabasappa et al., 2025) emphasizes prompt injection and code risks with lightweight detectors, yielding low annotation cost and efficient explanations; however, its coverage is narrower and adaptivity to unseen scenarios remains limited. LLMs in Synthetic Data. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional ability in producing synthetic data (Liu et al., 2024). In contrast to earlier techniques that relied on conventional language models (Schick & Schutze, 2021), modern LLMs present enhanced potential for generating high-quality synthetic datasets across numerous fields. These include areas such as multilingual question answering (Riabi et al., 2021), conversational systems (Zhao et al., 2023), instruction tuning (Xu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b; Zhong et al., 2024), improving factual accuracy (Wei et al., 2023), scentific capabilities (Huang et al., 2025b), and increasing dataset diversity (Dai et al., 2025; Chung et al., 2023; Riaz et al., 2025). Recently, the DataGen framework (Huang et al., 2025c) was proposed to create high-quality text datasets, supporting more precise evaluation and refinement of LLMs. Likewise, Janus, developed by Lee et al., is an LLM trained using broad set of synthetic system messages aimed at fostering both personalized and general alignment (Lee et al., 2024). Therefore, the strong potential of LLMs in synthetic data generation can serve as key avenue for obtaining high-quality training data for guardian models."

Users can specify attributes directly in the configuration file to shape generation behavior. Some used constraint examples are illustrated in Figure 13. Customizable risk injection. AuraGen also supports user-defined policies for injecting risks. As shown in Figure 14, users may set explicit probabilities for risk occurrence under different scenarios, or alternatively delegate probability estimation to the LLM, which infers likelihoods based on scenariorisk alignment. Scenarios in AuraGen. To approximate realistic agentic environments, we designed AuraGen scenarios by integrating two complementary sources. The first source is the OpenAI GPT Store, which offers wide range of user-facing applications. However, since the underlying tool specifications are not publicly released, we could not directly access them. Instead, we reconstructed the corresponding tool functions manually based on scenario descriptions, ensuring that each case remained executable while faithfully reflecting the original tasks. The second source comes from crawling multiple MCP server websites (e.g., https://mcpservers.org/), from which we extracted environment information. To guarantee diversity and richness, we retained only those servers that provided sufficient number of tools and discarded overly minimal cases. To avoid potential copyright or commercial issues, we anonymized several platformsfor instance, real-world travel booking provider was abstracted into more generic traveling ticket purchase platform. After collecting scenarios from these two sources, we further refined them with the help of Mixtral822B, which was used to polish descriptions, enrich tool functions, and generate representative examples. The refined scenarios were then manually checked to ensure coherence, correctness, and compliance with ethical considerations. Notably, AuraGen is designed with generalization in mind: the toolkit allows users to seamlessly introduce new scenarios through simple configuration files. This modularity enables continuous expansion into unseen domains, supporting both research flexibility and adaptation to rapidly evolving agentic systems. We show the statistics of the current scenarios in AuraGen in Figure 15, and show some scenario examples in Figure 16 and Figure 17."

Second, binary annotation data is typically scarcer and noisier compared to preference-style or aspect-level supervision. Training the RM to predict discrete keep/discard labels would tightly couple its capacity to the availability and consistency of such labels, likely leading to reduced generalization. In contrast, our two-stage approach leverages the stability of aspect-level RM scores and only requires lightweight classifier to capture human discard preferences.

For comparison, recent open-source APIs hosted on OpenRouter are substantially cheaper, yielding per-sample costs an order of magnitude lower: DeepSeek V3.1: $0.27/M input, $1.00/M output. gpt-oss-120b: $0.072/M input, $0.28/M output. These prices imply significantly lower costs under identical token lengths, supporting the scalability of our data generation pipeline. Latency Analysis. GPU settings. With concurrent inference enabled, our guardrail system achieves: In addition to cost, we also benchmarked inference latency under different H1008: 33 samples/second on average. A1008 (40GB): 3.7 samples/second on average. These results demonstrate that, under reasonable GPU provisioning, the latency of our approach remains fully acceptable and does not pose bottleneck for large-scale data generation."

            "content": "To enable robust normalization of heterogeneous outputs produced by diverse agentic systems, we first established set of canonical output styles, covering both structured and semi-structured formats.The formats span including XML, Tab Sepaa wide range, rated, Timestamp Epoch, Semicolon Single, Bullets, Markdown, JSON Compact, JSON Pretty, Numbered Steps, and KeyValue. These formats were selected to reflect realworld agent outputs observed across multiple platforms, covering variations in serialization syntax, layout conventions, and humanreadable documentation styles. Figure 19: Log style distribution in the dataset. Dataset construction followed dual-source synthesis strategy designed to balance structural determinism with stylistic diversity: Programmatic Synthesis. We implemented deterministic conversion pipeline in Python, which directly transformed data in the unified target schema into each of the pre-defined formats. This ensured exact coverage of all format variants and allowed controlled manipulation of structural elements (e.g., ordering of keys, indentation depth, delimiter types). However, the purely script-driven process lacked natural linguistic variability and did not fully capture the idiosyncratic deviations present in real system logs. LLM-based Transformation. To introduce stylistic diversity and realistic noise, we employed LLM to automatically rewrite the programmatically generated outputs. The LLM was prompted to (i) vary lexical and syntactic choices, (ii) adjust formatting in plausible but imperfect ways (e.g., inconsistent indentation, partially missing keys, embedded comments), and (iii) simulate naturally occurring variations found in agent trajectories. This step injected randomness while preserving semantic fidelity to the original content. To further enhance domain realism, both synthesis methods were grounded on the agent trajectory generated by AuraGen. The final dataset was balanced mixture of programmatically synthesized and LLM-augmented samples, and the style distribution is shown in Figure 19. We curated the collection to maximize coverage of format types and variability in structure, style, and noise. The dataset was split into 3,152 samples for training and 788 samples for testing. Human validation was conducted by two annotators (one PhD, one undergraduate in CS) to ensure the correctness of the test set."
