For example, Rainbow and TD3 (Hessel et al., 2018; Fujimoto et al., 2018), common methods for Atari and MuJoCo respectively (Bellemare et al., 2013; Todorov et al., 2012), have more differences than similarities in their shared hyperparameters  (Table 1)  without accounting for further algorithmic differences.

Unfortunately, these methods often offer poor sample efficiency and asymptotic performance compared more domain-specific approaches, and in some instances, can require extensive re-tuning over numerous implementation-level details (Engstrom et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022). Recently, DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023) and TD-MPC2 (Hansen et al., 2024), have showcased the potential of general-purpose model-based approaches, achieving impressive single-task performance on diverse set of benchmarks without re-tuning hyperparameters. However, despite their success, model-based methods also introduce substantial algorithmic and computational complexity, making them less practical than lightweight domain-specific model-free algorithms. This paper presents general model-free RL algorithm that leverages model-based representations to achieve the sample efficiency and performance of model-based methods, without the computational overhead. recent surge of high-performing model-free RL algorithms with dynamics-based representations (Guo et al., 2020; 2022; Schwarzer et al., 2020; 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Fujimoto et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Scannell et al., 2024) has showcased the potential of this family of algorithms when tailored for single benchmark. Recognizing the similarity between these modelbased and model-free approaches, our hypothesis is that the true benefit of model-based objectives is in the implicitly learned representation, rather than the model itself, and thus prompting the question: Can model-based representations alone enable sample-efficient general-purpose learning? Our proposed approach is based on learning features that approximately capture linear relationship between state-action pairs and value. To do so, we draw heavily from modern dynamics-based representation learning methods (see Related Work) as well as the work of Parr et al. (2008), who show that both model-based and model-free objectives converge to the same solution in linear space. By mapping states and actions into single, unified embedding, we eliminate any environmentspecific characteristics of the input space and allow for standardized set of hyperparameters. We evaluate our method, MR.Q, on four widely used RL benchmarks and 118 environments, and achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art domain-specific and general baselines without algorithmic or hyperparameter changes between environments or benchmarks."

            "content": "General-purpose RL. Although many traditional RL methods are general-purpose in principle, practical constraints often force assumptions about the task domain. For example, algorithms like Q-learning and SARSA (Watkins, 1989; Rummery & Niranjan, 1994) can be conceptually extended to continuous spaces, but are typically implemented using discrete lookup tables. In practice, early examples of general decision-making approaches can be found in on-policy methods with function approximation. For instance, both evolutionary algorithms (Rechenberg, 1978; Back, 1996; Rubinstein, 1997; Salimans et al., 2017) and policy gradient methods (Williams, 1992; Sutton et al., 1999; 2 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Schulman et al., 2015; 2017) offer update rules with convergence guarantees and independence to the input space. However, despite their generality, these methods are also hindered by poor sample efficiency and are prone to local minima, limiting their suitability for many practical applications. In contrast, the design of deep RL algorithms tends to favor more specialized approaches that align closely with single benchmarke.g., DQNAtari (Bellemare et al., 2013; Mnih et al., 2015), DDPGMuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012; Lillicrap et al., 2015), or AlphaGoGo (Silver et al., 2016). Generalizing beyond these initial benchmarks can often require significant engineering, tuning, or algorithmic discovery (Luong et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Haydari & Yılmaz, 2020; Ibarz et al., 2021). In imitation learning, GATO achieved generalist behavior, but relied on large expert datasets (Reed et al., 2022). Recently, DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023) demonstrated strong capability over many benchmarks without re-tuning, but used costly large models and simulated rollouts. Our objective is to discover lightweight model-free approach to general-purpose learning. Dynamics-based representation learning. Building representations from system dynamics is long-standing approach for adaptation, partial observability, and feature selection (Dayan, 1993; Littman & Sutton, 2001; Parr et al., 2008). Numerous model-free methods have been developed to learn representations by predicting future latent states (Munk et al., 2016; Van Hoof et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Gelada et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; 2022; Schwarzer et al., 2020; 2023; Zintgraf et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021; 2022; Fujimoto et al., 2021; 2024; McInroe et al., 2021; Seo et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024; Ni et al., 2024; Scannell et al., 2024). Unsurprisingly, these model-free approaches closely relate to model-based counterparts which learn latent dynamics model for planning or value estimation (Watter et al., 2015; Finn et al., 2016; Karl et al., 2017; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Schrittwieser et al., 2020; 2021; Ye et al., 2021; Hansen et al., 2022; 2024; Hafner et al., 2019; 2023; Wang et al., 2024). Our approach, MR.Q, is most closely related to the state-action representation learning in TD7 (Fujimoto et al., 2024). At high level, MR.Q differs from TD7 by discarding the original input and including losses over the reward and termination. MR.Q also differs significantly in implementation, drawing inspiration from prior work to determine set of design choices that performs well across benchmarks, including multi-step returns, unrolled dynamics, and categorical losses. Our motivation also relates to linear MDPs (Jin et al., 2020; Agarwal et al., 2020) and linear spectral representation (Ren et al., 2022; 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Shribak et al., 2024). The latter aims to learn low-rank decomposition of the transition dynamics of the MDP and recover linear relationship between an embedding and the value function. Similarly, our work connects to two-stage linear RL, where non-linear embedding is learned for linear RL (Levine et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2019). State abstraction. Our work is closely related to bisimulation metrics (Ferns et al., 2004; 2011; Castro, 2020) and MDP homomorphisms (Ravindran, 2004; van der Pol et al., 2020a;b; RezaeiShoshtari et al., 2022) which rely on measures of similarity in reward and dynamics for state or action abstraction. These concepts have inspired practical approximations to bisimulation metrics as means of shaping representations in deep RL agents, particularly those using image-based observations (Zhang et al., 2020; Castro et al., 2021; Zang et al., 2022)."

Value-based RL methods learn value function Qπ(s, a) = Eπ[ t=0 γtrts0 = s, a0 = a] that models the expected discounted sum of rewards rt R(st, at) by following policy π which maps states to actions a. The true value function Qπ is estimated by an approximate value function Qθ. We use subscripts to indicate the network parameters θ. Target networks, which are used to introduce stationarity in prediction targets, have parameters denoted by an apostrophe, e.g., Qθ . These parameters are periodically synchronized with the current network parameters (θ θ)."

Value-based RL algorithms learn value function that maps state-action pairs (s, a) to values in and policy π that maps states to actions a. Like many representation learning methods for RL, MR.Q adds an initial step that transforms states and state-action pairs into embeddings zs and zsa, which serves as inputs to the downstream policy and value function. fω zs, πϕ zs a, gω (s, a) zsa, Qθ zsa R. (1) (2) While neither the value function nor policy require explicit representation learning, using intermediate embeddings has two main benefits: 1. Introducing an explicit representation learning stage can enable richer alternative learning signals that are grounded in the dynamics and rewards of the MDP, as opposed to relying exclusively on non-stationary value targets used in both value and policy learning. 2. Representation learning can transform the input into unified, abstract space that is decoupled from the original input characteristics, e.g., images or action spaces. This abstraction allows us to filter irrelevant or spurious details and use unified downstream architectures, improving robustness to environment variations. To learn these embeddings, we draw inspiration from linear feature selection, revisiting the work of Parr et al. (2008), as well as MDP homomorphisms (Ravindran & Barto, 2002). In Section 4.1 we highlight how model-based objectives can be used to learn features that share an approximately linear relationship with the true value function. Then in Section 4.2, we relax our theoretical motivation for practical algorithm based on recent advances in dynamics-based representation learning."

            "title": "4.1 THEORETICAL MOTIVATION",
            "content": "Consider linear decomposition of the value function, where the value function Q(s, a) is represented by features zsa and linear weights w: (3) Our primary objective is to learn features zsa that share an approximately linear relationship with the true value function Qπ. However, since this relationship is only approximate, we use these features as input to non-linear function ˆQ(zsa), rather than relying solely on linear function approximation. Q(s, a) = saw. We start by exploring how to find features that can linearly represent the true value function. Given dataset of tuples (s, a, r, s, a), we consider two possible approaches for learning value function Q: model-free update based on semi-gradient TD (Sutton, 1988; Sutton & Barto, 1998): αED [w (z saw + γz sa wsg )2] . (4) model-based approach to learn wmb, based on rolling out estimates of the dynamics and reward: wmb = t=0 γtW pwr, wr = argmin ED [(z saw r)2] , Wp = argmin ED [(z saW zsa)2] . (5) (6) Closely following Parr et al. (2008) and Song et al. (2016), we can show that these approaches converge to the same solution (proofs for this section can be found in Appendix A). Theorem 1. The fixed point of the model-free approach (Equation 4) and the solution of the modelbased approach (Equation 5) are the same. From the insight of Theorem 1, we can connect the value error VE, the difference between an approximate value function and the true value function Qπ, VE(s, a) = Q(s, a) Qπ(s, a) (7) to the accuracy of reward and dynamics components of the estimated model (Theorem 2). Theorem 2. The value error of the solution described by Theorem 1 is bounded by the accuracy of the estimated dynamics and reward: 1 1 γ saWp Es,as,a[zsa ]) . sawr Ers,a[r] + max VE(s, a) max (s,a)SA wi (z (8) 4 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Parr et al. (2008) and Song et al. (2016) use related insight regarding the Bellman error to infer an approach for feature selection. However, with the advent of deep learning, we can instead directly learn the features zsa by jointly optimizing them alongside the linear weights wr and Wp. This is accomplished by treating the features and linear weights as unified end-to-end model and balancing the losses in Equation 6 with hyperparameter λ: L(zsa, wr, Wp) = ED [(z sawr r)2] + λED [(z saWp zsa )2] . (9) Reward learning Dynamics learning However, the resulting Equation 9 has some notable drawbacks. Dependency on π. The dynamics target zsa depends on an action determined by the policy π. In policy optimization problems, this introduces non-stationarity, where the target embedding must be continually updated to reflect changes in the policy. This creates an undesirable interdependence between the policy and encoder. Undesirable local minima. Jointly optimizing both the features zsa and the dynamics target can lead to undesirable local minima, similar to the issues encountered with Bellman residual minimization (Baird, 1995; Fujimoto et al., 2022). This can result in collapsed or trivial solutions when the dataset does not fully cover the state and action space or when the reward is sparse. To address these issues, we suggest relaxations on our proposed, theoretically grounded approach: L(zsa, wr, Wp) = ED [(z sawr r)2] + λED[(z saWp zs 2 ) ]. (10) Adjustment We propose two key modifications to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Firstly, we use statedependent embedding zs as the dynamics target, rather than the state-action embedding zsa. This eliminates any dependency on the current policy while still capturing the environments dynamics. Secondly, to mitigate the issue of local minima, we use target network fω(s) to generate the dynamics target zs, where the parameters ω are periodically updated to track the current network parameters ω. Empirical evidence from prior work suggests that this approach can yield significant performance gains (Grill et al. (2020); Assran et al. (2023), see Related Work), although it no longer guarantees convergence to fixed point. Due to these two changes, even if the modified objective defined by Equation 10 is minimized, we can no longer assume there is linear relationship between the embedding zsa and the value function. However, we can instead allow for non-linear relationship, replacing linear weights with non-linear function ˆQ(zsa). We can show that this relationship exists as long as the features are sufficiently rich (i.e., such that MDP homomorphism is satisfied (Ravindran & Barto, 2002)). Theorem 3. Given functions (s) = zs and g(zs, a) = zsa, then if there exists functions ˆp and ˆR such that for all (s, a) A: ˆR [ ˆR(zsa)] = ER [R(s, a)] , ˆp(zszsa) = p(ˆss, a), (11) ˆszˆs=zs then for any policy π where there exists corresponding policy ˆπ(azs) = π(as), there exists function ˆQ equal to the true value function Qπ over all possible state-action pairs (s, a) A: ˆQ(zsa) = Qπ(s, a). (12) Furthermore, Equation 11 guarantees the existence of an optimal policy ˆπ(azs) = π(as). Consequently, even if the features zsa do not linearly represent the true value function, i.e., the loss in Equation 9 cannot be not exactly minimized, zsa can still be used in non-linear relationship to represent the value function. Furthermore, Theorem 3 outlines similar objective as the original linear objective defined in Equation 9, in learning the reward and dynamics of the MDP. These results motivates the practical algorithm discussed in the following section. Using the adjusted loss defined in Equation 10, we will aim to learn features with an approximately linear relationship to the true value function, but use non-linear value function with those features to account for the error induced by our approximations. 5 Published as conference paper at ICLR"

We use LAP (Fujimoto et al., 2020) to sample transitions with priority according to their TD errors (Schaul et al., 2016), the absolute difference between the predicted value and the target value in Equation 19. The target network, reward scaling (defined in Equation 19), and the encoder are updated periodically every Ttarget time steps. This synchronized update schedule keeps the input and target output fixed for the downstream value function and policy within each iteration, thus reducing nonstationarity in the optimization (Fujimoto et al., 2024)."

Given subsequence of an episode (s0, a0, r1, d1, s1, ..., rHEnc , dHEnc, sHEnc ), the model is unrolled by encoding the initial state s0, then by repeatedly applying the state-action encoder gω and linear MDP predictor m: zt, rt, dt = gω(zt1, at1)m, where z0 = fω(s0). (13) The final loss is summed over the unrolled model and balanced by corresponding hyperparameters: LEncoder(f, g, m) = HEnc t= λRewardLReward(rt) + λDynamicsLDynamics(zt s) + λTerminalLTerminal( dt). (14) λTerminal is set to 0 until the first terminal transition (i.e., = 0) is viewed. This approach is commonly used in model-based RL (Oh et al., 2015; Hafner et al., 2023; Hansen et al., 2024), as well as dynamics-based representation learning (Schwarzer et al., 2020; 2023; Scannell et al., 2024). Reward loss. While our theoretical analysis suggests using the mean-squared error to train the predicted reward, we find that categorical representation of the reward is more effective in practice for predicting sparse rewards and is robust to reward magnitude. This empirical benefit is consistent with prior work (Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023; Hansen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). Our reward loss function uses the cross entropy CE between the predicted reward and two-hot encoding of the reward r: LReward(r) = CE (r, Two-Hot(r)) . (15) 6 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 To handle wide range of reward magnitudes without prior knowledge, the locations of the two-hot encoding are spaced at increasing non-uniform intervals, according to symexp(x) = sign(x)(exp (x) 1) (Hafner et al., 2023). Dynamics loss. The dynamics loss minimizes the mean-squared error between the predicted next state embedding zs and the next state embedding zs from the target encoder fω : LDynamics(zs) = (zs zs )2 . (16) As discussed in the previous section, using the next state embedding zs eliminates the dependency on the policy that would occur when using state-action embedding target. Terminal loss.

Specifically, we train two value functions and take the minimum output between their respective target networks to determine the value target. Similar to TD3, the target action is determined by the target policy πϕ , perturbed by small amount of clipped Gaussian noise: aπ = {argmax clip(a, 1, 1) for discrete A, for continuous A, where = πϕ(s) + clip(ϵ, c, c), ϵ (0, σ2). (18) Discrete actions are represented by one-hot encoding, where the Gaussian noise is added to each dimension. Action noise and the clipping is scaled according the range of the action space. We modify the TD3 loss in few ways. Firstly, following numerous prior work across benchmarks (Hessel et al., 2018; Barth-Maron et al., 2018; Yarats et al., 2022; Schwarzer et al., 2023), we predict multi-step returns over horizon HQ. Secondly, we use the Huber loss instead of meansquared error to eliminate bias from prioritized sampling (Fujimoto et al., 2020). Finally, the target value is normalized according to the average absolute reward in the replay buffer: LValue( Qi) = Huber Qi, 1 HQ1 t=0 γtrt + γHQ , = min j=1,2 Qθ (zsHQ aHQ ,π ). (19) The value captures the target average absolute reward, which is the scaling factor used to the most recently copied value functions Qθ .

For exploration, Gaussian noise is added to each dimension of the action (or one-hot encoding of the action). Similar to Equation 18, the resulting action vector is clipped to the range of the action space for continuous actions. For discrete actions, the final action is determined by the argmax operation. 7 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Gym - Locomotion 5 tasks DMC - Proprioceptive 28 tasks DMC - Visual 28 tasks Atari 57 tasks i r - 3 1.5 1. 0.9 0.6 0.3 0.0 0.0 ) 1 ( a l T 0.8 0.6 0.4 0. 0.0 0.0 1.0 ) 1 ( w a T 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0. 0.0 0.0 0.5 i r - u 4.0 3. 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0. 0.1 0.4 Time Steps (1M) 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.4 Time Steps (1M) 0.3 1. 0.5 2.0 Time Steps (1M) 1.5 2.5 0.4 0.2 0.8 Time Steps (1M) 0.

This subset of the Gym benchmark (Brockman et al., 2016; Towers et al., 2024) considers 5 locomotion tasks in the MuJoCo simulator (Todorov et al., 2012) with continuous actions and low level states. Agents are trained for 1M time steps without any environment preprocessing. We evaluate against three baselines: TD7 (Fujimoto et al., 2024), state-of-the-art (or near) approach for this benchmark, as well as TD-MPC2, DreamerV3, and PPO. To aggregate results, we normalize using the performance of TD3 (Fujimoto et al., 2018). DMC - Proprioceptive. The DeepMind Control suite (DMC) (Tassa et al., 2018) is collection of continuous control robotics tasks built on the MuJoCo simulator. These tasks use the proprioceptive states as the observation space, meaning that the input is vector, and limit the total reward for each episode at 1000, making it easy to aggregate results. We report results on all 28 default tasks that were used by either TD-MPC2 or DreamerV3. Agents are trained for 500k time steps, equivalent to 1M frames in the original environment due to action repeat. For comparison, we evaluate against the same three algorithms as in the Gym benchmark, with TD-MPC2 considered state-of-the-art (or near) for this benchmark. We also include TD7 due to its strong performance in the Gym benchmark. DMC - Visual. The visual DMC benchmark includes the same 28 tasks as the proprioceptive benchmark, but uses image-based observations instead. Agents are trained for 500k time steps. For baselines, we include DrQ-v2 (Yarats et al., 2022), given its state-of-the-art (or near) performance in model-free RL, alongside TD-MPC2, DreamerV3, and PPO. Atari. The Atari benchmark is built on the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013). This benchmark uses pixel observations and discrete actions and includes the 57 games used by DreamerV3. We follow standard preprocessing steps, including sticky actions (Machado et al., 2018) (full details in Appendix B.3). Agents are trained for 2.5M time steps (equivalent to 10M frames), setting which has been considered by prior work (Sokar et al., 2023). For comparison, we evaluate against three baselines: the model-based approach DreamerV3, as well as model-free approaches, DQN (Mnih et al., 2015), Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018), and PPO. Results are aggregated by normalizing scores against human performance. Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Discussion. Throughout our experiments, we find the presence of no free lunch, where the topperforming baseline in one benchmark fails to replicate its success in another. Regardless, MR.Q achieves the highest performance in both DMC benchmarks, showcasing its ability to handle different observation spaces. Although it falls slightly behind TD7 in the Gym benchmark, MR.Q is the strongest method overall across all continuous control benchmarks. In Atari, while DreamerV3 outperforms MR.Q, it relies on model with 40 times more parameters and struggles comparatively in the remaining benchmarks. When compared to the model-free baselines, MR.Q surpasses PPO, DQN, and Rainbow, demonstrating its effectiveness with discrete action spaces."

MR.Q in practice relaxes this theoretical result by modifying the loss and using non-linear value function. In Linear value function, we replace the non-linear value function with linear function. In Dynamics target, we replace the state embedding dynamics target with state-action embedding zsa determined from the target state-action encoder gω. In No target encoder, we use the current encoder to generate the dynamics target zsa, and jointly optimize it within the encoder loss. In Revert, we consider all of the aforementioned changes simultaneously, using linear value functions and setting the dynamics target as state-action embedding determined by the current encoder. In Non-linear model, we replace the linear MDP predictor with individual networks that predict each component separately from zsa. Loss functions. MR.Qs loss functions use several unconventional choices. In MSE reward loss, we replace the categorical loss function on the predicted reward in Equation 15 with the meansquared error (MSE). In No reward scaling, we remove the reward scaling in Equation 19, setting = = 1. In No min, we take the mean over the target value functions instead of the minimum in Equation 19. In No LAP, we remove prioritized sampling (Fujimoto et al., 2020) and use the MSE instead of the Huber loss in the value update. Lastly, in No MR, we remove model-based representation learning and train the encoder end-to-end with the value function. Horizons. Finally, we consider the role of extended predictions. In 1-step return, we remove multi-step value predictions and use TD learning. In No unroll, we remove the dynamics unrolling in Equation 14, by setting the encoder horizon HEnc = 1. 9 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Discussion. The results of our design study show the benefit of balancing theory with practical relaxations. The experiments further validate our design choices and hyperparameters. We highlight two results in particular: (1) increasing the model capacity in the non-linear model experiment, does not improve performance. This outcome suggests that maintaining an approximately linear relationship with the value function can be more impactful than increased capacity. (2) Our study also reveals key distinction between the Gym and Atari benchmarkswhile the MSE reward loss and No unroll variants offer moderate performance gains in Gym, they significantly degrade performance in Atari. This discrepancy highlights how hyperparameters can overfit to individual benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of evaluating algorithms across multiple benchmarks."

            "title": "6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION",
            "content": "This paper introduces MR.Q, general model-free deep RL algorithm that achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks and environments. Drawing inspiration from the theory of model-based representation learning, MR.Q demonstrates that model-free deep RL is promising avenue for building general-purpose algorithms that achieve high performance across environments, while being simpler and less expensive than model-based alternatives. Our work also reveals insights on which design choices matter when building general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms and how common benchmarks respond to these design choices. Model-based and model-free RL. MR.Q integrates model-based objectives with model-free backbone during training, effectively blurring the boundary between traditional model-based and model-free RL. While MR.Q could be extended to the model-based setting by incorporating planning or simulated trajectories with the state-action encoder, these components can add significant execution time and increase the overall complexity and tuning required by method. Moreover, the performance of MR.Q in these common RL benchmarks demonstrates that these model-based components may be simply unnecessarysuggesting that the representation itself could be the most valuable aspect of model-based learning, even in methods that do use planning. This argument is echoed by DreamerV3 and TD-MPC2, which rely on short planning horizons and trajectory generation, while including both value functions and traditional model-free policy updates. As such, it may be necessary to examine more complex settings, to reliably see benefit from model-based search or planning, e.g., (Silver et al., 2016). Universality of RL benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that there is striking lack of positive transfer between benchmarks. For example, despite the similarities in tasks and the same underlying MuJoCo simulator, the top performers in Gym and DMC fail to replicate their success on the opposing benchmark. Similarly, although DreamerV3 excels at Atari, these performance benefits do not translate to continuous control environments, underperforming TD3 in Gym and outright failing to learn the Dog and Humanoid tasks in DMC (see Appendix C). These findings show the limitations of single-benchmark evaluations, indicating that success on one benchmark may not translate easily to others, and highlights the need for more comprehensive benchmarks. Limitations. MR.Q is only the first step towards new generation of general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms. Many challenges remains for fully general algorithm. In particular, MR.Q is not equipped to handle settings such as hard exploration tasks or non-Markovian environments. Another limitation is our evaluation only considers standard RL benchmarks. Although this allows direct comparison with other methods, established algorithms such as PPO have demonstrated their effectiveness in highly unique settings, such as team video games (Berner et al., 2019), drone racing (Kaufmann et al., 2023), and large language models (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). To demonstrate similar versatility, new algorithms must undergo the same rigorous testing across range of tasks that is beyond the scope of any single study. As the community continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with deep RL, we believe that building simpler general-purpose algorithms has the potential to make this technology more accessible to wider audience, ultimately enabling users to train agents with ease. Perhaps one daywith just the click of button. 10 Published as conference paper at ICLR"

We omit any custom environments included by the TD-MPC2 authors. The same subset of tasks are used in the evaluation of proprioceptive and visual control. Like prior work, for both observation spaces, we use an action repeat of 2 (Hansen et al., 2024). For visual control, the state (network input) is composed of the previous 3 observations which are resized to 84 84 pixels in RGB format (Tassa et al., 2018). Atari. For the Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013; Brockman et al., 2016; Towers et al., 2024), we use the 57 games in the Atari-57 benchmark that appears in prior work (Hessel et al., 2018; Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Badia et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023). For DQN and Rainbow, two games (Defender and Surround) are missing from the Dopamine framework (Castro et al., 2018) and are omitted. We use the -v5 version. For MR.Q, we use the common preprocessing steps (Mnih et al., 2015; Machado et al., 2018; Castro et al., 2018), where an action repeat of 4 is used and the observations are grayscaled, resized to 84 84 pixels and set to the max between the 3rd and 4th frame. The state (network input) is composed of the previous 4 observations.
