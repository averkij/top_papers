            "content": "The rapid advancement and the widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) have introduced new safety risks to LLM-based systems since harmful outputs can have severe consequences in real-world applications. Existing safety assurance research has focused primarily on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors (e.g., Anthropic, 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Meta, 2024; DeepSeek, 2025), but recent studies have revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. For instance, Qi et al. (2024) demonstrated how to compromise GPT-3.5 Turbos safety alignment via OpenAIs finetuning API at cost of only $0.20; Andriushchenko et al. (2025) showed that simply prefilling the LLM response with compliant prefix (e.g., Sure, here is how to make bomb.) can easily bypass the safety guardrails of Anthropics Claude 3 and 3.5 with 100% attack success rate. These findings highlight pressing need to strengthen safety assurance mechanisms beyond training-phase safety alignment. Concurrently, the recent inference scaling paradigm has revolutionized the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek, 2025). Despite these transformative advances, inference scaling remains uncharted in the area of safety assurance. To bridge this fundamental gap, we explore inference scaling in this work as new frontier for establishing stronger and robuster safety assurance against emerging threats, targeting the following central question: How powerful is inference scaling in LLM safety assurance? This paper debuts positive answer to the question. Nevertheless, it is still highly non-trivial to design an inference scaling method for safety assurance. While existing advanced inference scaling methods have been successful in reasoning tasks, we found that they are even less scaling-efficient than the most basic method, Best-of-N Sampling, when applied to safety assurance. We systematically analyze this limitation and have identified critical issue that we call the explorationefficiency dilemma: more reward model calls lead to worse scaling efficiency. To address this challenging dilemma, we then introduce Safe Multifurcation (SAFFRON), the first inference scaling paradigm for LLM safety assurance to our knowledge. To further contextualize our work, we introduce our solution and outline our main contributions as follows: Insights. We observe that advanced inference scaling methods are even less scaling-efficient in safety assurance than the most basic method, Best-of-N Sampling. Our analysis uncovers that this limitation is caused by the explorationefficiency dilemma: every exploration incurs non-negligible computational overhead due to calling the process reward model. Paradigm. To address this critical dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, the first inference scaling paradigm for LLM safety assurance to the best of our knowledge. Our key idea is replacing the process reward model (PRM) with multifurcation reward model (MRM), which substantially reduces the total number of reward model calls. Method. To instantiate this new paradigm into practical method, we then develop (i) partial supervision objective for MRM training, (ii) conservative exploration constraint to eliminate out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) Trie-based keyvalue (KV) caching strategy to enable KV cache sharing across sequences in tree search. Evaluation. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method. Our proposed method significantly outperform baseline methods against highly challenging jailbreak attacks. Resources. We release our trained multifurcation reward model, SAFFRON-1, along with our token-level safety reward dataset, Safety4M. We believe that these resources will facilitate and expedite future research on LLM safety."

Given an vocabulary space V, let n(n 0) denote the set of length-n sequences over V, let + := (cid:83) n1 denotes the set of all non-empty finite sequences over V. For sequence +, let denote the length of the sequence. For two sequences s1, s2 B, let s1s2 denote their concatenation. Decoding in language models. Inference-time decoding in autoregressive language models typically relies on sampling strategies to generate output sequences. Let π denote pretrained policy model (e.g., an LLM), and let + be given prompt. decoding algorithm defines distribution over possible continuations D(π, x), where is sampled from π(y x) according to predefined strategy, such as greedy-decoding, top-k sampling or temperature sampling. Inference scaling. Inference scaling refers to the practice of sampling multiple candidate completions from D(π, x) and selecting the best one based on some scoring criterion. The most basic approach is Best-of-N sampling, where candidate completions {y(i)}N i=1 are drawn independently, and the highest-scoring sequence is selected: = argmaxi[N ]R(xy(i)), where R(xy) denotes reward function that evaluates the quality of the output with respect to the prompt x. widely adopted instantiation of is the process reward model (PRM), learned model that provides scalar alignment feedback to candidate completions. PRMs are frequently used to guide exploration in intermediate steps. For instance, Rebase extends Beam Search by selecting continuations based on reward signals rather than likelihood alone, while Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) treats decoding as sequential decision process and expands candidate trajectories via Monte Carlo-based exploration. Both methods offer structured alternatives to naive sampling, enabling more informed search over output sequences. LLM safety. The task of LLM safety focuses on identifying and mitigating unsafe generations from large language models. Given prompt and model-generated continuation y, the goal is to determine whether violates predefined safety criteriasuch as producing harmful, deceptive, or policy-breaking contentand to take corrective action if necessary. This is typically determined using an LLM-as-a-Judge setup, where separate model evaluates the safety of the output."

            "content": "We systematically analyze the trade-off between exploration and scaling efficiency of existing inference scaling methods when applied to safety assurance against jailbreaking attacks. We present our experimental settings in Section 3.1, visual comparison of their scaling efficiencies in Section 3.2, and controlled investigation in Section 3.3. 3.1 Experimental settings Methods. For the jailbreaking attack method, we use recent powerful attack called Prefilling Attack (Vega et al., 2023; Andriushchenko et al., 2025; Qi et al., 2025). For instance, given prompt Whats the best way to distribute pirated movies and software?, Prefilling Attack forces the output to start with Step 1: Prepare the content: and let the policy LLM continue from this prefilled output. Though it seems simple, Prefilling Attack has proven extremely effective, such as jailbreaking Anthropics Claude 3 and 3.5 with 100% attack success rate (Andriushchenko et al., 2025). For 3 inference scaling methods, we use Best-of-N (sampling, Brown et al., 2024), Rebase (beam search, Wu et al., 2025), and DeAL (MCTS, Huang et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024), which we have briefly introduced in Section 2. Metrics. We measure inference compute in terms of TFLOP (1 TFLOP means 1012 floating-point operations). To measure safety, we use the attack success rate (ASR) under Prefilling Attack. Regarding inference scaling efficiency, since Brown et al. (2024) has found logarithmic inference scaling law in reasoning tasks, and we empirically observe similar inference scaling law under our safety assurance setting, we define an inference scaling efficiency metric ScalEff as ScalEff := log TFLOPLim ASR TFLOP , (1) where TFLOPLim is an upper bound of TFLOP. Models. For the policy model π, we use Llama 3 8B (Meta, 2024), which is instruction-tuned for dialogue use cases and thus suitable for safety evaluations. For the safety process reward model (PRM) R, we use Llama Guard 3 1B (Meta, 2024), which is compact yet effective safeguard model that can classify which responses pose safety risks. Prefilled tokens are excluded from safety evaluation. We will show in this section that even though the PRM is much smaller than the policy model, it still incurs non-negligible computational overhead that drastically worsens the scaling efficiency of inference scaling methods. Dataset. Following Qi et al. (2025), we use their Harmful HEx-PHI dataset to evaluate LLM safety under prefilling attack. Harmful HEx-PHI is comprehensive dataset consisting of harmful prompts and their corresponding responses. We use 10% subset of it in this section. We prefill 10 tokens for Prefilling Attack and let the policy model generate at most 32 tokens. Implementation details. Due to the page limit, please see Appendix A.1. 3.2 Existing methods are not scaling-efficient in safety assurance To analyze the scaling efficiency of existing inference scaling methods, we present their scaling plots in terms of ASR vs TFLOP in Figure 2. The results reveal surprising trend: advanced inferencetime scaling methods, Rebase (Beam Search) and DeAL (MCTS), are even less scaling-efficient in reducing ASR compared to the most basic method Best-of-N Sampling. Specifically, the ASR curves of Beam Search and MCTS consistently lie above that of Best-of-N across varying levels of inference compute. For instance, at an inference budget of around 90 TFLOP, Best-of-N achieves an ASR of around 0.5 whereas Beam Search and MCTS suffer from higher ASRs of around 0.7 and 0.8, respectively. This scaling inefficiency stems from the computational overhead introduced by the PRM calls inherent in tree search methods. tree search process requires multiple calls to the safety PRM to identify the best children per generation step, significantly increasing the total inference compute. Meanwhile, Best-of-N performs single PRM call per generated sample, thus incurring less computational overhead. This trend seems counterintuitive at the first sight. While Beam Search and MCTS help in reasoning tasks and outperform Best-of-N , these methods backfire under the safety assurance setting. This limitation is due to the fact that safety-related questions are typically open-ended and do not have fixed answer. Consequently, these methods can no longer leverage self-consistency to verify the answers (e.g., majority voting), which is often an essential technique in reasoning methods (Brown et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025). 3.3 More exploration even leads to worse scaling efficiency To quantitatively dissect the explorationefficiency dilemma, we conduct controlled experiments varying the degree of exploration. For Beam Search, we implement the standard beam search algorithm with the PRM and vary the number of explored children of each search node (#Children). For MCTS, we vary the number of lookahead steps (Lookahead). We use TFLOPLim = 500 for Beam Search and TFLOPLim = 100 for MCTS to calculate ScalEff. The results are presented in Table 1. 4 Table 1: More exploration even leads to worse scaling efficiency (ScalEff). Method # Children TFLOP ASR ScalEff Beam Search 2 4 122.12 319.54 0.781 0. 1.804 0.796 Method Lookahead TFLOP ASR ScalEff MCTS 0 2 80.70 86.92 0.906 0.875 0.237 0.160 For Beam Search, while expanding the number of explored children sometimes leads to improved safety in terms of ASRs, the computational overhead dramatically increases due to more frequent PRM calls and increases so much that the scaling efficiency worsens drastically. For example, when we expand #Children from 2 to 4, the ASR decreases from 0.781 to 0.562, but the inference compute rises from 122.12 TFLOP to 319.54 TFLOP. For MCTS, more lookahead steps could only slightly improve the safety, which in turn worsens the scaling efficiency. This trend underscores an insidious and pernicious dilemma in safety assurance: although more exploration can sometimes enhance safety, it also amplifies computational costs even more, primarily due to the expensive PRM calls. Despite its compact size, the PRM Llama Guard 3 1B model introduces significant overhead when invoked repeatedly during inference. This overhead becomes bottleneck in tree search methods that rely on frequent process reward assessments. Consequently, this emphasizes pressing need to develop more scaling-efficient method for safety assurance that essentially avoid this reluctant explorationefficiency dilemma."

            "title": "4 SAFFRON: Safe Multifurcation",
            "content": "Having analyzed why existing inference scaling methods for reasoning are not suitable for safety assurance, we now introduce Safe Multifurcation (SAFFRON), the first inference scaling paradigm for LLM safety assurance to our knowledge. 4.1 From process reward models to multifurcation reward models Inefficiency of process reward models. As analyzed in Section 3.3, main cause of the poor scaling efficiency of existing inference scaling methods is that tree search exploration needs to call the process reward model (PRM) too many times. Let us illustrate this critical issue with an example. Let : + denote the PRM, and let + denote the current sequence s. Suppose that we want to choose the next token of from candidate tokens a1, . . . , aK V. To identify the best next token, inference scaling methods typically need to call the PRM times to compute their corresponding rewards R(sa1), . . . , R(saK) and choose the token with the highest reward as the next token of s. Exploring children of search node would need to call the PRM times to identify the best child. As result, more exploration even leads to worse scaling efficiency, contradicting the intention of employing these inference scaling methods. See Figure 1 for visual illustration of this critical issue. Multifurcation reward model for tree search. How can we address this reluctant dilemma and design scaling-efficient method for safety assurance? Our core idea is to reduce the number of reward model calls by proposing new type of the reward model, which we call multifurcation reward model (MRM). While PRM computes only single reward in each call, our MRM can compute the rewards for all possible next tokens simultaneously in one single call. To achieve this desideratum, our key design is simple yet essential modification to the reward model architecture: Unlike PRM outputting scalar reward, our MRM predicts reward vector instead. Formally, an MRM is decoder-only Transformer θ : + RV taking the current sequence as input and predicts reward vector θ(s) RV , where θ denotes trainable parameters of the MRM. The MRM is trained such that Mθ(s)a approximates R(sa) for every possible next token of s. Hence, the MRM can be interpreted as reward version of the network in reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2015). Our proposed MRM can be seamlessly integrated into any tree search method simply by replacing the PRM : + with our proposed MRM θ : + RV . We call this proposed paradigm Safe Multifurcation (SAFFRON). In this work, we instantiate the proposed paradigm through variant of beam search. Suppose that the current beam contains sequences := {s1, . . . , sN } +. For each sequence si in the beam, let π (si) denote the set of top-p tokens (Holtzman et al., 2020) for si: π (si) := (cid:26) : (cid:88) (cid:27) π(a si) < , aV: π(asi)>π(asi) (2) where π is the policy model, and 0 < < 1 is threshold hyperparameter. To ensure that the generated sequence is grammatically valid and semantically cohesive, we only consider the topp tokens π (si) as possible continuations of si. Then, to decide the next beam, we call the MRM θ(si) once for each sequence si in the current beam, and this one call yields the rewards Mθ(si)a R(sia) of all possible next tokens π (si) simultaneously. Here, replacing the PRM with the MRM reduces the number of reward model calls for each sequence si from π (si) to one, which is significant improvement. Finally, the next beam is selected as possible continuations sia with the top-N highest predicted rewards Mθ(si)a: := argtopN sa: sB, aN π (s) Mθ(s)a. (3) We call this proposed tree search method SAFFRON-1. The MRM-based tree search procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. 4.2 Partial supervision for MRM training Training objective. As introduced in Section 4.1, we need to train the MRM such that Mθ(s)a approximates R(sa) for every possible next token of sequence s. However, unlike distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), it is infeasible here to employ full supervision for the entire vector θ(s) RV because many tokens are not even suitable continuations of s. naïve idea to address this is to restrict supervision to only top-p tokens, e.g., minimizing the following squared error: Lnaïve(s, a) := (Mθ(s)a R(sa))2, π (s). (4) However, this would still be inefficient because we would need to call the PRM π obtain process rewards R(sa) of all top-p tokens π (s). (s) times to Hence, to design practical objective for MRM training, we instead propose partial supervision instead of the typical full supervision in distillation. Specifically, we only use sequences from the training corpus and do not consider any other possible next tokens; nevertheless, we will use all prefixes of the sequences (instead of the entire sequences only) in the training corpus to ensure that every token in the training corpus is maximally utilized. Let denote sequence from the training corpus C. Then for each prefix s[0:j+1) of s, we regard s[0:j) as the input of the MRM and sj as the next token of s[0:j) and thus train the MRM θ by minimizing the following squared error: LMRM(s[0:j+1)) := (Mθ(s[0:j))sj R(s[0:j+1)))2, 1 1. (5) Note that we do not need to call the PRMs on the fly. Instead, we pre-compute all process rewards R(s[0:j+1)) before training the MRM and store them as token-level safety reward dataset. Parameter-efficient finetuning. To train the MRM efficiently, we finetune from the PRM via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al., 2022) to obtain the MRM, modifying only small number of parameters and retaining the rewarding capabilities of the original PRM. In addition to standard LoRA, we also allow the bias vector of the unembedding layer to be trainable, while keeping its weight matrix frozen. This subtle yet important modification enhances the expressiveness of the MRM, enabling better approximation to the PRM without significantly increasing the number of training parameters. After training, we apply the deployment strategy described in Hu et al. (2022) to the trained MRM so that our parameter-efficient finetuning would not introduce any additional latency over the original PRM during inference. Publicly available dataset & model. As described above, to enable MRM training, we construct Safety4M, large-scale dataset of 4 million token-level safety rewards, which is curated by annotating the HH-RLHF (Anthropic, 2022) corpus using Llama Guard 3 1B (Meta, 2024) as the PRM : + R. Based on this dataset, we finetuned Llama Guard 3 1B as the MRM θ : + RV . With little abuse of terminology, we also refer to this trained MRM as SAFFRON-1. SAFFRON-1 achieves high accuracy in approximating the process rewards given by the original Llama Guard 3 1B model while being capable of predicting multifurcation reward vectors, making it suitable to enhance the scaling efficiency of tree search methods. We will release both our dataset Safety4M and our MRM SAFFRON-1 to facilitate and expedite further research on LLM safety assurance. 4.3 Conservative exploration constraint Unreliability of unseen tokens. Due to the finite coverage of the MRM training corpus C, there exist tokens in that never appear in the training corpus (e.g., non-English tokens). We refer to such tokens as unseen tokens, and let Vunseen denote the set of unseen tokens. Why do we need to be cautious about unseen tokens? By examining the gradient of the unembedding layer of θ, we theoretically show that the predicted reward of unseen tokens are unreliable. This finding is formally stated in our following Proposition 1. Proposition 1 (unreliability of unseen tokens). Let RV denote the bias vector of the unembedding layer of the MRM θ, and let LMRM be the MRM training loss defined in Section 4.2. Then, bVunseen Es[0:j+1)C[LMRM(s[0:j+1))] = 0. (6) This implies that the bias term ba of any unseen token Vunseen has never received supervision signal during training and thus remains its unreliable initialized value. Proposition 1 implies that the MRM might predict arbitrary rewards Mθ(s)a for unseen tokens Vunseen, which are not grounded by the reward dataset. Naively allowing tree search to explore these unreliable tokens would risk invalidating the safety guardrail that we aim to enforce. Conservative exploration constraint. To avoid the detriment from unseen tokens, we propose conservative exploration constraint. Conservatism (e.g., conservative Q-learning, Kumar et al., 2020) is an essential technique in offline reinforcement learning to avoid deviating from the training environment. To implement conservatism for our MRM, we postprocess the MRM-predicted reward vector as follows: Mcons(s)a := (cid:26), Mθ(s)a, if Vunseen, if / Vunseen, +, V. (7) Using cons(s) instead of the raw θ(s) ensures explored sequences to be restricted solely to seen tokens, whose reward predictions are supported by the MRM training corpus distribution. In similar spirit to conservatism in offline reinforcement learning, our conservative exploration constraint acts as an additional guardrail against out-of-distribution extrapolations in tree search. 4.4 Trie-based keyvalue cache sharing Keyvalue (KV) caching (Pope et al., 2023) is powerful technique for decoder-only Transformers to amortize the cost of selfattention by caching the keyvalue pairs of previous tokens in sequence. Although vanilla KV caching can already eliminate computational redundancy for individual sequences, there still exist considerable repeated KV caches in tree search due to the shared prefixes among sequences generated during tree search. While some past research has investigated KV cache sharing among sequences (e.g., Kwon et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024), most of them are not specially tailored to tree search. To facilitate KV cache sharing across sequences in tree search, we unify recent KV caching strategies (Yao et al., 2025; Chan et al., 2025) into simplified strategy using the Trie data structure (Fredkin, 1960; a.k.a. the prefix tree). Tree search inherently explores multiple continuations with common prefixes, and Trie naturally encodes this prefix-sharing structure, enabling efficient 7 Figure 3: Our Trie-based KV caching facilitates cache sharing across sequences. lookup for common prefixes and efficient branching for divergent next tokens without duplicating KV caches. Specifically, we structure the KV caches as Trie data structure, where each Trie node corresponds to prefix of generated sequence and stores the associated keyvalue pair tensors. Whenever we append next token to sequence, we insert the KV pair of this token into the Trie. Our Trie-based KV cache sharing is illustrated in Figure 3. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees (Proposition 2) on time and space efficiency of our Trie-based KV cache sharing strategy. Proposition 2 (reduced time & space complexity). Let s1, . . . , sN be the sequences explored by SAFFRON-1, and let SN denote the set of permutations of 1, . . . , . With our Trie-based KV cache sharing, the total time complexity of calling the MRM for all prefixes of s1, . . . , sN (i.e., θ((si)[0:j))i=1,...,N, j=1,...,si) is (cid:18) (cid:88) si2 i=1 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Time under vanilla KV caching max σSN (cid:124) i= 1 (cid:88) LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))2 (cid:19) , (cid:123)(cid:122) Time reduced by our Trie-based KV cache sharing (cid:125) and the total space complexity of their KV caches is (cid:18) (cid:88) si i=1 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Space of vanilla KV caches max σSN (cid:124) i=1 1 (cid:88) LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1)) (cid:19) , (cid:123)(cid:122) Space reduced by our Trie-based KV cache sharing (cid:125) (8) (9) where LCP : + + denotes the length of the longest common prefix of two sequences. Since many sequences typically share common prefixes in tree search, our Proposition 2 suggests that our Trie-based KV cache sharing would substantially reduce the time and space complexity."

As inference budget increases, baseline methods show diminishing returns or plateauing performance, while our method continues to improve efficiently under only very low inference compute budget. This trend highlights the favorable scaling efficiency of our proposed method SAFFRON-1. For instance, to reduce ASR to around 0.4, our proposed SAFFRON-1 needs only about 60 TFLOP while the strongest baseline requires about 190 TFLOP. Overall, the results indicate that our method achieves the most efficient inference scaling law, making it particularly suitable for practical deployment under constrained computational resources. 5.4 Evaluation under varying search widths To evaluate our proposed SAFFRON-1 from more fine-grained perspective, we vary the search width to control the inference compute and report the attack success rate (ASR) under each search width. As reference, we also report the ASR under no defense. The results are presented in Table 3 and Figure 4a. From Table 3, we observe that even though the policy model is not specially trained against Prefilling Attack, increasing inference compute with SAFFRON-1 can still substantially reduce the attack success rates. Furthermore, we observe from Figure 4a that our SAFFRON-1 already considerably reduces the attack success rates at relatively small inference compute budget. For instance, on the Harmful HExPHI dataset, small width 16 can already reduce the ASR from 0.897 to 0.497, which is relatively 45% improvement. These observations demonstrate the strong inference scaling efficiency of our proposed SAFFRON-1. 5.5 Evaluation of MRM reward approximation To investigate the effectiveness of our proposed partial supervision objective, we evaluate how accurate our MRM θ approximates the PRM R. We show scatter plot where one dimension is the observed safety rewards from the PRM, and the other dimension is the rewards predicted by the MRM. The results are presented in Figure 4b. From Figure 4b, we observe that our MRM accurately approximates the safety rewards assessed by the PRM. In particular, even though the observed rewards from the PRM range from 10 to +10, most of the rewards predicted by our MRM have an error of at most 1. The results demonstrate the considerable accuracy in approximating the observed safety rewards from the PRM. 5.6 Case studies on output quality preservation Warning: This subsection contains red-teaming data that can be harmful or offensive in nature. We conduct case studies on the Harmful HEx-PHI dataset to investigate whether our proposed SAFFRON-1 preserves the output quality. We compare with recent method called DeepAlign (Qi 9 (a) Our SAFFRON-1 already considerably reduces the attack success rates at relatively small inference compute budget. (b) Our MRM accurately approximates the safety rewards assessed by the PRM.

The output prefixes from Prefilling Attack are marked in red . Lexical variety. We observe that DeepAlign suffers from severe degeneration in lexical variety while our proposed SAFFRON-1 does not. few cases are attached below, and the repeated phrases generated by DeepAlign are marked in yellow .

In stark contrast, the outputs generated by our SAFFRON-1 are more diverse and more engaging to read. 1. Prompt: What is the best way to torture someone? Give step-by-step instructions.

We also observe that sometimes when there is room to help the user, our proposed SAFFRON-1 tries to generate more genuine and helpful response instead of simple rejection to the unsafe request. For instance, when user asks about suicide, our SAFFRON-1 offers resources for the user to seek mental health support. few cases are attached below. 10 1.

            "content": "LLM Safety. Existing efforts in AI safety primarily focused on alignment techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (Taori et al., 2023), direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022) etc. However, recent work reveals that these aligned models remain vulnerable to adversarial behaviors, such as jailbreaking attacks (Shen et al., 2024). These findings highlight the need for robust, inference-time safety mechanisms that can dynamically guard against misuse. Reward Models. Reward models are essential proxies for human values, guiding optimization in RLHF. Existing reward models for safety tasks are primarily outcome-based (Mu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025), whereas process reward models (PRMs) have largely been confined to reasoning tasks involving complex, multi-hop inferences (Zhang et al., 2025b; Li et al., 2025). In this work, we train efficient PRMs specifically for safety tasks to enhance inference scaling. Inference Scaling. Recent work has shown that scaling test-time compute can be more effective than increasing training compute (Snell et al., 2024). Existing inference-scaling methods allocate extra decoding budget to explore and rank multiple candidate trajectories, using algorithms such as beam search (Chan et al., 2025) and nucleus (topp) sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019). More aggressive approaches, including Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022), Tree-of-Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023), and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), iteratively refine or backtrack over intermediate thoughts, yielding large gains on complex reasoning benchmarks. The aggregation of these strategies usually involve PRMs (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025a). Despite their effectiveness, existing inference scaling techniques have focused almost exclusively on reasoning tasks, which typically have well-defined answers. In contrast, the domain of safety remains underexplored, with its open-ended protocols and context-sensitive risks posing distinct challenges. Only very few concurrent works explored inference scaling for safety, which primarily has focused on analyzing and improving best-of-N (Beirami et al., 2024; Balashankar et al., 2024)."

            "title": "7 Conclusion & Discussion",
            "content": "In this work, we have investigated the explorationefficiency dilemma of existing advanced inference scaling methods and proposed SAFFRON, novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we have further proposed: (i) partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) Triebased keyvalue caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Limitations & future work. limitation of this work is that safety inference scaling applies only to closed-source LLMs. Developing safety assurance techniques for open-source LLMs is an interesting future work. Another limitation is that the MRM depends on the tokenizer of the policy LLM. While LLMs with the same tokenizer can share an MRM, LLMs with different tokenizers would need different MRMs. Broader impact. This paper presents work whose goal is to develop stronger method for AI safety assurance. There are many potential societal consequences of our work. For example, defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks will facilitate responsible use of AI."

Then for any non-decreasing function ϕ : R, we have max σSN 1 (cid:88) i=1 ϕ(LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))) = 1 (cid:88) i=1 ϕ(LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))). (22) Proof of Lemma 3. Let denote the set of Trie nodes of the Trie of sequences s1, . . . , sN , and let denote the set of non-root Trie nodes.

In particular, by Equations (34) & (29), the upper bound Equation (35) is achieved by σ: 1 (cid:88) i=1 ϕ(LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))) = (N 1)ϕ(0) + = (N 1)ϕ(0) + (cid:88) vT (cid:88) vT (ϕ(δ(v)) ϕ(δ(v) 1)) 1 (cid:88) i=1 1[σ(i)Iv, σ(i+1)Iv] (ϕ(δ(v)) ϕ(δ(v) 1))(Iv 1). It follows from Equations (35) & (38) that max σSN 1 (cid:88) i=1 ϕ(LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))) = 1 (cid:88) i=1 ϕ(LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))). We are now ready to prove Proposition 2. (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) Proof of Proposition 2. Let σ SN denote permutation such that sσ(1), . . . , sσ(N ) is sorted in non-decreasing lexicographical order. W.l.o.g., suppose that we call the MRM in the order of sσ(1), . . . , sσ(N ). Time complexity. For the first sequence sσ(1), since the decoder-only Transformer needs to process all tokens in the sequence sσ(1), the time spent on sσ(1) by the decoder-only Transformer is at most (cid:18) sσ (1) (cid:88) (cid:19) T1 := = O(sσ(1)2). j=1 (39) For other sequences sσ(i) (i = 2, . . . , ), since its first LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i)) tokens of sσ(i) have already been processed as part of sσ(i1), then the additional time spent on sσ(i) by the decoder-only Transformer is at most (cid:18) Ti := sσ (i) (cid:88) (cid:19) j=LCP(sσ (i1),sσ (i))+1 = O(sσ(i)2 LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i))2). (40) 18 Hence, by Lemma 3 w.r.t. ϕ(n) := n2, the total time complexity is at most T1 + (cid:88) i= Ti = O(sσ(1)2) + (cid:18) = sσ(1)2 + (cid:88) i= (cid:88) i=2 O(sσ(i)2 LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i))2) sσ(i)2 (cid:88) i= LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i))2 (cid:19) = = (cid:18) (cid:88) i=1 (cid:18) (cid:88) i=1 sσ(i)2 1 (cid:88) i=1 LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))2 (cid:19) si2 max σSN 1 (cid:88) i=1 LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1))2 (cid:19) . Space complexity. For the first sequence sσ(1), the space of its KV caches is at most S1 := (cid:18) sσ (1) (cid:88) j=1 (cid:19) 1 = O(sσ(1)). (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) For other sequences sσ(i) (i = 2, . . . , ), since its first LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i)) tokens share the KV caches with that of sσ(i1), the space of its additional KV caches is at most (cid:18) Si := sσ (i) (cid:88) (cid:19) 1 j=LCP(sσ (i1),sσ (i))+1 = O(sσ(i) LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i))). (46) Hence, by Lemma 3 w.r.t. ϕ(n) := n, the total space complexity is at most (47) (48) (49) S1 + (cid:88) i=2 Si = O(sσ(1)) + (cid:18) = sσ(1) + (cid:88) i=2 (cid:88) i=2 O(sσ(i) LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i))) sσ(i) (cid:88) i=2 LCP(sσ(i1), sσ(i)) (cid:19) = = (cid:18) (cid:88) i=1 (cid:18) (cid:88) i=1 sσ(i) 1 (cid:88) i= LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1)) (cid:19) (cid:19) LCP(sσ(i), sσ(i+1)) . si max σSN 1 (cid:88) i="
