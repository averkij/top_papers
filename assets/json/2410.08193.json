            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Learning from human feedback is essential in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values such as helpfulness and harmlessness [Leike et al., 2018]. Traditional training-time alignment approaches, such as RLHF [Ouyang et al., 2022] and DPO [Rafailov et al., 2024], finetune LLMs using human preference datasets to achieve alignment. However, these methods incur substantial training costs and struggle to accommodate diverse or conflicting user-specific preferences, as they require retraining for each set of objectives. These limitations drive interest in test-time alignment methods that use reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs during text generation at test time. Existing test-time alignment methods often rely on trajectory-level reward models, which evaluate rewards based on entire generated responses rather than providing next-token rewards necessary for autoregressive generation, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. For instance, ARGS [Khanov et al., 2024] approximates next-token rewards by applying trajectory-level RMs to partially generated responses, leading to errors since these RMs are trained only on complete responses. Other methods [Huang et al., 2024, Chakraborty et al., 2024] compute next-token rewards by generating complete responses for each next-token candidate, significantly increasing inference costs. GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT Figure 1: Next-token generation guided by different RMs. Using trajectory-level RM to select the next token (top) requires the costly process of generating full responses for each candidate. In contrast, GenARM (bottom) efficiently samples the next token by combining scores from the base LLM and our proposed Autoregressive RM, which is trained to predict next-token rewards directly. To address these challenges, we introduce the Autoregressive Reward Model, novel reward parametrization designed specifically to predict next-token rewards, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy in guided generation. Autoregressive RM parametrizes the reward of complete response as log probability, which has natural token-level factorization into the sum of log probabilities conditioned on past tokens. It can be interpreted as strategy for transforming the sparse reward structure of traditional trajectory-level RMs into dense one. We theoretically show that within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework [Jaques et al., 2017], this parametrization is expressive enough to enable Autoregressive RM to guide frozen LLMs towards any distribution achievable by traditional RMs. Training an Autoregressive RM uses the same preference datasets and objective function as trajectory-level RMs. Specifically, the Autoregressive RM is trained to predict next-token rewards such that the accumulated token-level rewards over full response (i.e., the trajectory-level reward) are higher for preferred response than for less preferred one. Building on the Autoregressive RM, we present Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model (GenARM), test-time alignment approach that integrates Autoregressive RMs next-token rewards with the logits of frozen LLM to generate responses aligned with human preferences. Since Autoregressive RM is trained to predict next-token rewards from partial responses, GenARM benefits from more accurate reward guidance compared to methods that use trajectory-level RMs to evaluate partial responses. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1, GenARM samples the next token by directly combining the next-token rewards with the base LLMs logits, making it far more efficient during inference than approaches that require generating multiple full responses to compute next-token rewards with trajectory-level RM. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) Superior Performance: GenARM not only significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment baselines but also proves to be the most inference-efficient. Additionally, it matches training-time method DPO in alignment efficacy. (2) Weak-to-Strong Guidance: GenARM enables smaller Autoregressive RM (e.g., 7B parameters) to guide much larger frozen LLM (e.g., 70B parameters), aligning the larger models without incurring the high computational costs of training it. This exemplifies weak-to-strong generalization [Burns et al., 2023], enhancing stronger model through weaker test-time guidance. (3) Multi-Objective Alignment: Aligning LLMs with diverse human values requires balancing multiple, potentially conflicting dimensions such as helpfulness and harmlessness [An et al., 2024], with the ideal trade-off varying among users. GenARM enables multi-objective alignment by using multiple Autoregressive RMs for different dimensions and adjusting reward weights at test time, enabling personalized alignment without retraining to accommodate different preference configurations. Contributions. (1) We propose GenARM, which leverages the novel Autoregressive RM that predicts next-token rewards from partial responses to enable efficient and effective autoregressive text generation. (2) Theoretically, we show that Autoregressive RM can guide frozen LLM towards any decoding distribution achievable by traditional RMs. (3) Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches training-time methods. (4) GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. (5) GenARM facilitates multi-objective alignment, enabling test-time adjustment of reward weights to accommodate diverse user needs without retraining the base LLM."

            "content": "Training-time alignment. Aligning language models with human preferences is crucial for downstream tasks. The standard RLHF approach [Ouyang et al., 2022, Stiennon et al., 2020] trains reward model on human preferences and 2 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT then optimizes the language model via reinforcement learning (RL). DPO [Rafailov et al., 2024] directly fine-tunes LLMs on preference datasets, avoiding the need for RL. However, training-time methods require expensive training of LLMs and are limited to pre-defined preferences, lacking the flexibility to adapt to new or multi-dimensional preferences during inference [Casper et al., 2023]. In contrast, our work focuses on test-time alignment techniques, offering control signals for aligning text generation during inference. Test-time alignment. Test-time alignment approaches use reward models to guide the text generation of frozen LLMs during inference. Prior methods primarily rely on trajectory-level RMs that evaluate complete responses instead of next-tokens based on partial responses, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies in next-token generation. For instance, ARGS [Khanov et al., 2024] applies trajectory-level RMs to partial responses, resulting in inaccurate reward evaluations since these RMs are only trained on complete responses. Other methods [Huang et al., 2024, Chakraborty et al., 2024] compute next-token rewards by generating full responses following each next-token candidate and then evaluating them with the trajectory-level RM, which significantly increases inference costs due to the need to simulate complete trajectories for every token generation. Some approaches [Mudgal et al., 2023, Han et al., 2024] also require training separate value function for partial responses. In contrast, our proposed Autoregressive RM learns token-level rewards directly from data, enabling more efficient guided decoding without additional training or increased inference costs. Multi-objective alignment. Aligning with multi-dimensional human preferences is crucial for tailoring responses to user needs [Vamplew et al., 2018, Jang et al., 2023], as users often prefer varying strengths across different dimensions. Multi-objective RLHF (MORL) [Li et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2024] requires retraining LLMs for every new preference configuration by using linear combinations of multiple RMs, making it computationally expensive. To avoid retraining, other methods train specialized LLMs for each preference dimension and merges their parameters [Jang et al., 2023, Rame et al., 2023] or output logits Shi et al. [2024] to handle various preference combinations. Preference-conditioned prompting methods [Wang et al., 2024, Guo et al., 2024, Yang et al., 2024] fine-tune LLMs to adapt to mixed preferences by incorporating the relevant coefficients directly into the textual inputs. However, all these methods require fine-tuning the LLM, which can be computationally expensive and lacks test-time flexibility for new preference dimensions. In contrast, GenARM can use potentially smaller Autoregressive RM for each preference dimension to guide the frozen LLM, avoiding intensive training costs and enabling inference-time configurability. Weak to strong supervision. Developing scalable approaches that enable weaker models to guide stronger ones is crucial for aligning powerful or even superhuman models in the future. Training-time methods involve fine-tuning larger models using labels from smaller ones [Burns et al., 2023] or enhancing them through self-rewarding techniques [Yuan et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2024]. For test-time approaches, Ji et al. [2024] trains small LLM to correct outputs from larger LLMs, while other works [Mitchell et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2024] leverage distributional differences between small tuned and untuned model to refine the larger models outputs. In contrast, our work introduces novel, dedicated reward model for autoregressive reward-guided decoding, enabling efficient weak-to-strong guidance by using smaller Autoregressive RM to guide larger base LLMs."

            "content": "In this section, we review the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipeline [Ziegler et al., 2019, Ouyang et al., 2022] and its connection to controlled decoding. 3.1 RLHF RLHF typically begins with base model, denoted as πbase, which is usually obtained by fine-tuning pre-trained language model using supervised learning on high-quality data tailored for specific downstream tasks. The process then involves three main steps: (1) preference data collection, (2) reward learning, and (3) RL optimization, which we detail next. Preference data collection. To collect the preference data, the base model πbase is given prompts to generate pairs of answers (y1, y2) πbase(y x). These answer pairs are then presented to human labelers, who express their preference for one answer. This preference is denoted as yw yl x, where yw and yl represent the preferred and dispreferred responses, respectively, from the pair (y1, y2). The collected preference dataset is denoted as D. Reward learning. The reward model r(x, y) is typically learned using the negative log-likelihood loss, as follows: E(x,yw,yl)D (cid:2)log σ(r(x, yw) r(x, yl))(cid:3) min (1) where σ is the logistic function. As for the architecture, the reward model r(x, y) is typically initialized from the base model πbase(y x), with learnable linear layer added on top of the final transformer layer to produce single scalar prediction for the reward value Ziegler et al. [2019]. 3 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT RL fine-tuning. To fine-tune the base model πbase to adapt to human preference, the objective is to maximize the reward while minimizing deviation from the base model, as follows: max π ExD,yπ(x)r(x, y) βDKL(π(yx)πbase(yx)) (2) where β is parameter controlling the deviation. This objective is then optimized with reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO [Schulman et al., 2017]. 3.2 Controlled decoding from the RL objective Controlled decoding. controlled decoding approach to objective in Equation (2) circumvents the need for RL training. It involves using its closed-form solution [Ziebart et al., 2008, Rafailov et al., 2024] as follows log πdecode(yx) = log Z(x) + log πbase(yx) + r(x, y), (3) 1 β where can be any complete response and Z(x) is an partition function. In other words, the base language model πbase is kept frozen and the reward model r(x, y) guides its generation process. Challenge. Generating the next token from partial response according to Equation (3) involves estimating next-token rewards, not directly provided by trajectory-level reward models. ARGS [Khanov et al., 2024] directly evaluates incomplete responses using these models, leading to inaccuracies. Other methods like [Huang et al., 2024, Chakraborty et al., 2024] generate full trajectories to compute rewards when generating each token, substantially raising inference costs."

            "content": "4.1 Autoregressive Reward Model To enable efficient next-token guided generation, we propose the Autoregressive Reward Model (Autoregressive RM), which directly learns to predict next-token rewards from data. Parameterization. The proposed Autoregressive RM treats the reward r(x, y) as log probability log πr(yx) by parametrizing it as sum of log probabilities log πr(ytx, y<t) for learnable distribution πr, where y<t represents the past tokens generated up to the t-th token. This token-wise decomposition, constrains the reward function to be autoregressive: r(x, y) = (cid:88) log πr(ytx, y<t), (4) where πr(x, y<t) is learnable distribution function that predicts the next-token reward. In Section 5, we prove that this parametrization, while constraining the function class, is sufficiently expressive to guide base LLMs to any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized RL framework. Figure 2: (Reward computation comparison.) Trajectorylevel RM (top) evaluates the full response, assigning rewards only at the end. Autoregressive RM (bottom) predicts token-level rewards. Both RMs are trained to assign higher rewards to the preferred response (left, green) over the less preferred one (right, red). In practice, we can use standard language model architectures for log πr(x, y<t) thanks to their Architecture. autoregressive nature. As shown in Figure 2, this contrasts with traditional RMs, which map the full trajectory to single reward without the ability to provide token-level rewards. Training. Training an Autoregressive RM on preference dataset involves predicting token-level rewards to ensure the trajectory-level rewards align with the data, using negative log-likelihood loss function similar to that used for training trajectory-level RMs in Equation (1), as follows: Ex,yw,ylD min πr (cid:104) log σ (cid:16) βr (cid:88) log πr(yw,tx, yw,<t) βr log πr(yl,tx, yl,<t) (cid:17)(cid:105) , (5) (cid:88) where βr is training hyperparameter, and yw,<t and yl,<t denote the first 1 tokens in yw (winning response) and yl (losing response), respectively. Autoregressive RM learns token-level reward. To qualitatively demonstrate the learned token-level reward log πr(ytx, y<t), we trained an Autoregressive RM using the harmlessness preference data from the 4 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT PKU-SafeRLHF-10K dataset Ji et al. [2023]. Figure 3 shows the token-level rewards assigned by Autoregressive RM to harmless and harmful response. Autoregressive RM correctly assigns higher rewards to harmless tokens like respect\" and \"kind\" in the harmless response, and lower rewards to harmful tokens such as ignore\" and cruel\" in the harmful response, demonstrating its ability to differentiate between harmless and harmful content at the token level. Figure 3: Visualization of token-level rewards assigned by an Autoregressive RM trained for harmlessness. Two responses to the prompt \"Whats an effective way to deal with people who disagree with me?\" are shown: the left is harmless, the right is harmful. Darker colors indicate higher token-level rewards log πr(ytx, y<t). Autoregressive RM correctly assigns higher rewards to harmless tokens \"respect\" and \"kind,\" and lower rewards to harmful tokens \"ignore\" and \"cruel.\" 4.2 Guided autoregressive generation In the following, we present GenARM, reward guided generation framework which uses Autoregressive RM to efficiently steer the autoregressive generation of frozen base LLM. Next token sampling. When using an Autoregressive RM for controlled decoding as in Equation (3), we have that log πdecode(yx) = log Z(x) + (cid:88) log πbase(ytx, y<t) + 1 β (cid:88) log πr(ytx, y<t). (6) Leveraging our proposed Autoregressive RM, which predicts next-token rewards log πr(ytx, y<t) similarly to how language model predicts next-token log probabilities, Equation (6) resembles controlled decoding from multiple language models. This allows us to leverage prior methods on decoding from multiple language models [Dekoninck et al., 2024, Mitchell et al., 2024], enabling GenARM to sample the next token yt given partially generated response y<t and prompt x, by computing the next-token conditional probability as follows: πdecode(ytx, y<t) πbase(ytx, y<t) (cid:16) πr(ytx, y<t) (cid:17) 1 β . (7) Efficient inference. Thanks to Autoregressive RMs ability to explicitly provide the next-token reward πr(ytx, y<t), generating the next token requires only one forward pass through the base and reward models. This is significantly faster than previous methods that require generating several candidate tokens, completing the full response for each, and then selecting the best next token. Weak to strong guidance. In practical scenarios, fine-tuning smaller, typically weaker language model (e.g., 7B) is often feasible, while fine-tuning larger, stronger model (e.g., 70B) may be impractical due to resource constraints. To deal with prohibitive training costs of aligning larger model, we can train smaller Autoregressive RM and use it to guide the frozen larger language model to align with human preferences, eliminating the need to fine-tune the larger model. Moreover, unlike prior test-time alignment methods like Best-of-N and Transfer [Chakraborty et al., 2024], which require generating multiple responses from the base LLM to produce one final responseincurring significant inference costs, especially for larger base LLMsGenARM generates single response autoregressively, making it far more efficient. ExD,yπ(x) Multi-objective alignment. In practice, human preferences are multi-dimensional and we often need to align LLMs to balance multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Given reward functions r(i)(x, y) for each dimension i, multi-objective alignment can be formalized [Rame et al., 2023] as αir(i)(x, y) βDKL(π(yx)πbase(yx)), where αi is user-specific solving πdecode(yx) = arg maxπ coefficient for dimension i. Training-based alignment methods like multi-objective RL [Wu et al., 2024] requires retraining the LLM for different αi, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, Autoregressive RM offers an efficient solution: We train an Autoregressive RM r(i)(x, y) = (cid:80) log π(i) (ytx, y<t) for each dimension i. Therefore, similar to Equation (6), we have that log πdecode(yx) = log Z(x) + (cid:80) log πbase(ytx, y<t) + 1 (ytx, y<t). At inference time, we extend the sampling β strategy in Equation (7) to multiple reward functions as: log π(i) αi (cid:80) (cid:80) (cid:80) πdecode(ytx, y<t) πbase(ytx, y<t) (cid:89) (cid:16) π(i) (ytx, y<t) (cid:17)αi/β . (8) 5 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT Therefore, we can efficiently accommodate diverse user preferences by adjusting the {αi} coefficients at test time without repeatedly training the base LLM."

            "title": "5 Thoeretical insights: Expressiveness of Autoregressive RM",
            "content": "Autoregressive RM parameterizes the reward function r(x, y) as log likelihood log πr(yx). In the following, we theoretically demonstrate that this parametrization preserves the full expressiveness of the reward function class, enabling Autoregressive RM to guide the base LLM toward any decoding distribution achievable by unconstrained trajectory-level RMs. Definition 1 (Equivalence class of rewards). Two reward functions r1(x, y) and r2(x, y) are equivalent iff r1(x, y) r2(x, y) = (x) for some function (x) that does not depend of y. Lemma 2 (Rafailov et al. [2024]). Under the Plackett-Luce, and in particular the Bradley-Terry, preference framework, two reward functions from the same class induce the same preference distribution and the same optimal policy under the constrained RL problem in Equation (2). Therefore, when learning reward functions, it is sufficient to learn any function within the optimal equivalence class. Below, we further demonstrate that each equivalence class contains reward function in the form of log probability, justifying the choice of parametrizing the reward model as log probability in Autoregressive RM. The detailed proof is provided in Appendix A. Theorem 3. All reward equivalence classes can be represented with the parameterization log πr(yx) for some probablity distribution πr(yx). Proof Sketch. Take any reward function r(x, y). Consider the following reward function ˆr(x, y) := log exp r(x, y) exp r(x, z) (cid:80) . First, ˆr(x, y) is consistent with the parameterization log πr(yx) with πr(yx) = exp r(x,y) Second, since r(x, y) ˆr(x, y) = log (cid:80) exp r(x, z) does not depend of y, ˆr(x, y) and r(x, y) are equivalent. Therefore, ˆr(x, y) is member of the equivalence class of r(x, y) with the desired form, and we do not lose any generality in our reward model from the proposed parameterization. exp r(x,z) . (cid:80) Summary. The key theoretical insight of parametrizing the reward model as log probability, as in Autoregressive RM, is its ability to fully preserve the expressiveness of the reward equivalence class and decoding policies. This design is not only theoretically sound but also practical, enabling token-wise factorization that greatly improves the efficiency of next-token generation in GenARM."

We follow the experimental settings of ARGS [Khanov et al., 2024]. We use the HH-RLHF dataset [Bai et al., 2022], where each sample includes prompt followed by two responses, with one response being marked as preferred in terms of overall helpfulness and harmlessness.

Our test-time alignment baselines include (1) ARGS [Khanov et al., 2024], which directly uses traditional trajectory-level RM to score partially generated responses to guide the generation. (2) Transfer-Q [Chakraborty et al., 2024], which generates the next token by sampling = 10 candidates, completing full responses for each, and using the trajectory-level RM to select the best candidate. To reduce inference costs, Transfer-Q approximates full responses by sampling 20 new tokens, meaning the inputs to the trajectory-level RM are still partial responses. (3) We also include DPO [Rafailov et al., 2024] as the training-time alignment baseline. 6 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT Models and training. For the base model used by GenARM and ARGS, we use the LLaMA-7B-SFT checkpoint provided by Khanov et al. [2024]1, which is fine-tuned from LLaMA-7B [Touvron et al., 2023] on the preferred responses of the HH-RLHF. For both Autoregressive RM and DPO, we fine-tune LLaMA-7B-SFT with LoRA [Hu et al., 2021] for one epoch on the training split of HH-RLHF. For Autoregressive RM, we set βr = 0.05, and use learning rate of 5 104. For DPO, we use βDPO = 0.1 and learning rate of 5 104. We directly use the trajectory-level RM provided by Khanov et al. [2024]2. Generation and evaluation. Our evaluation follows Khanov et al. [2024]. We generate text responses for 300 randomly selected prompts from the HH-RLHF test set, with maximum prompt length of 2,048 tokens and continuation limit of 128 tokens. We use β = 1 with GenARM. Response quality is assessed using GPT-4-based evaluation in terms of helpfulness, harmlessness, relevance, accuracy, and insightfulness. Additional details, including generation hyperparameters for ARGS and Transfer-Q, as well as the evaluation prompt, are provided in Appendix B.1. Table 1: Head-to-head comparison between GenARM, test-time baselines (ARGS and Transfer-Q) and training-time baseline (DPO) based on GPT-4 evaluation.

Moreover, our method slightly outperforms DPO, while other test-time methods fall short, effectively bridging the performance gap between training-time and test-time alignment methods.

Additionally, GenARM is significantly more efficient than Transfer-Q, which requires generating full responses or multiple new tokens for evaluating next-token reward, demonstrating the efficiency gain of using Autoregressive RM for direct next-token rewards. 6.2 Weak to strong guidance In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of GenARM in the weak-to-strong guidance setting, where RMs trained on smaller, weaker LLMs guides larger, more capable base LLMs. Datasets and models. We consider the Tulu2 model family [Ivison et al., 2023], which includes SFT-finetuned and DPO-finetuned models at parameter scales of 7B, 13B, and 70B. At each scale, the DPO models are finetuned from the corresponding SFT model using filtered and binarized version of the UltraFeedback dataset3 [Cui et al., 2023]. Training. We fully fine-tune both the Autoregressive RM and the trajectory-level RM on the UltraFeedback dataset, starting from the 7B SFT model Tulu2-7B. Following [Ivison et al., 2023], we set βr = 0.1 and use learning rate of 5 107 when training the Autoregressive RM; for the trajectory-level RM, we use learning rate of 5 106. Both RMs are trained for 3 epochs. Baselines. We consider (1) the SFT (base) model at each parameter scale. For test-time alignment baselines, we include (2) ARGS and (3) Best-of-N (BoN), which generates = 16 full responses, uses trajectory-level RM to evaluate them, and selects the response with the highest reward. For training-time alignment baseline, we include (4) 1https://huggingface.co/argsearch/llama-7b-sft-float32 2https://huggingface.co/argsearch/llama-7b-rm-float32 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized 7 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT the released Tulu2 DPO models at each parameter scale. Note that for all test-time alignment methods (GenARM, ARGS, and BoN) we train only 7B RMs. However, the training-time baseline DPO finetunes the SFT model at each parameter scale, including 13B and 70B, which is computationally expensive, if not prohibitive in many use cases. Weak-to-strong Guidance. For all test-time alignment methods, we use 7B RMs to guide base LLMs at different parameter scales. Specifically, GenARM employs 7B Autoregressive RM, while the test-time baselines ARGS and BoN use 7B trajectory-level RM. We select the SFT models Tulu2-7B, Tulu2-13B, and Tulu2-70B as the base models. This setup simulates scenarios where training larger-scale models (such as 13B and 70B) is computationally prohibitive, allowing us to use smaller 7B RM to steer these larger and more capable models. Evaluation. Our evaluation is based on AlpacaEval 2 [Li et al., 2023], which comprises 805 evaluation prompts. To ensure controlled comparison, we evaluate all models against the smallest SFT model in the Tulu2 family, Tulu2-7B, since all the LLMs and RMs are derived from models within the Tulu2 family. We report both the raw win rate and the length-controlled (LC) win rate [Dubois et al., 2024], metric designed to be robust against model verbosity. We use β = 1 for GenARM during inference. We provide details about hyperparamters of baselines, additional pairwise comparison results (including comparison with GPT-4), and results with varying reward coefficient 1 β in Appendix B.2. Figure 4: (Weak to strong guidance) AlpacaEval 2 length-controlled win rate (left) and raw win rate (right) compared against Tulu2-7B. The X-axis shows the base SFT models used by test-time alignment methods employing 7B RMs. DPO fine-tunes the SFT model at each parameter scale. Results. The evaluation result is shown in Figure 4, where the X-axis represents the base SFT models at different parameter scales. For the test-time alignment methods (ARGS, BoN, and GenARM), these base models are guided using 7B RMs. DPO fine-tunes these base SFT models at each parameter scale. We provide our observations below. Insight 3: GenARM enables effective weak-to-strong guidance. GenARM with 7B Autoregressive RM consistently improves all base LLMs across all scales, outperforming all test-time alignment methods. It also surpasses DPO at the 7B scale and nearly matches DPO at the 13B scale. At the 70B scale, GenARM recovers more than 80% of the performance gap in both raw and LC win rates between Tulu2-70B and Tulu2-DPO-70B, all without the need to train the 70B LLM. Insight 4: GenARM enables more accurate token-level guidance. GenARM significantly outperforms ARGS when the base LLM comes from every parameter scale, demonstrating the superiority of using Autoregressive RM to provide next-token rewards over using trajectory-level RMs based on partial responses. We observe that ARGS struggles to generate long responses, often producing gibberish as the responses get longer, indicating that trajectory-level RMs are insufficient for consistent guidance during generation. Insight 5: GenARM outperforms BoN while being much more efficient. GenARM outperforms BoN when the base LLM comes from every parameter scale. Moreover, BoN requires generating = 16 full responses, resulting in 16 times more inference time on the base LLMsa substantial burden, especially with large models. This highlights the efficiency gain of using Autoregressive RM for next-token rewards instead of evaluating full responses after they have been generated. 6.3 Multi-objective Alignment In this section, we move beyond alignment with average human preferences to focus on multi-objective alignment. Specifically, we address two preference dimensions: helpfulness and harmlessness, aiming to explicitly balance the 8 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT trade-off between them. For this purpose, we use the PKU-SafeRLHF-10K dataset4 Ji et al. [2023], which has preference labels for both dimensions. Baselines. (1) Rewarded Soups (RS) [Rame et al., 2023] trains specialized LLMs for each preference using DPO and interpolates their weights to balance trade-offs between preference dimensions. (2) Multi-objective RL (MORL) trains reward models for each dimension and uses their linear combinations for RL training, requiring repeated training for different reward model coefficients. Models and training. The base model is the Alpaca-7B model [Taori et al., 2023]. The specialized models of RS, MORL models and Autoregressive RM are all finetuned from the Alpaca-7B model. Additionally, we extend the 7B Autoregressive RM to guide the larger Alpaca-65B base model, capability unique to GenARM. In contrast, RS and MORL require training the full 65B model, which is computationally expensive and beyond our available resources. This highlights the practicality of GenARM, as it only requires training smaller 7B model to guide larger models. We provide the detailed training settings for all methods in Appendix B.3. Figure 5: (GenARM can incorporate guidance from multiple RMs to generate the response.) Responses from three models: the left and right responses are from DPO models trained only on helpfulness and harmlessness data, respectively, while the middle response is from GenARM, guided by both helpfulness and harmlessness rewards simultaneously with equal reward coefficients. Generation. For GenARM, we treat the αhelpful as the coefficients for the helpfulness and harmlessness dimension, respectively during sampling as in Equation (8). We keep αhelpful from 0 to 1. For RS, the model parameters are linear combination of the LLM parameters trained for each preference dimension. We keep the sum of the linear coefficients to be 1 and vary them between [0, 1]. β = 1 and vary αhelpful β + 0.2 αharmless and αharmless β β β Evaluation. We use GPT-4 to assess both helpfulness and harmlessness following the methodology of Dai et al. [2024]. We compare each model to the base model Alpaca-7B and calculate separate win, tie, and lose rates in terms of both helpfulness and harmlessness dimensions. The evaluation prompts for GPT-4 are provided in Appendix B.3. We report results using the formula win rate + 1 2 tie rate to measure generation quality for each preference dimension. The evaluation uses the same 500 prompts as in Dai et al. [2024], covering both helpfulness and harmlessness alignment. Qualitative Results. Figure 5 presents responses to harmful prompt from three models: DPO model trained on helpfulness data, DPO model trained on harmlessness data, and GenARM with equal coefficients for both dimensions. The DPO model trained on helpfulness generates response that is helpful but harmful, while the model trained on harmlessness completely rejects the prompt, offering no useful information. In contrast, GenARM produces responses that are both helpful and harmless, effectively balancing the base LLMs alignment between the two preference dimensions. Insight 6: GenARM enables effective and efficient alignment with multi-dimensional preferences. As shown in Figure 6 (left), our method not only surpasses RS in achieving better frontier but also performs comparably to MORL while being significantly more efficient without retraining, highlighting its superior effectiveness in managing multi-dimensional preference alignment. Insight 7: GenARM enables weak-to-strong guidance in multi-objective alignment. As shown in Figure 6 (right), our 7B Autoregressive RM effectively guides the 65B base model along two dimensions, capability that baselines 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF-10K 9 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT Figure 6: (Multi-objective alignment) (Left) The front of win-tie rates against the base LLM Alpaca-7B for GenARM, RS and MORL.

            "content": "We introduced GenARM, test-time alignment approach that uses the proposed Autoregressive RM to guide frozen LLMs with next-token rewards, enabling efficient autoregressive generation. Theoretically, Autoregressive RM can guide LLMs toward any decoding distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized RL framework. Empirically, GenARM outperforms prior test-time baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency and matches trainingtime methods. It also enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs, and supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time adaptation to diverse preferences without retraining. Limitations and future work. While our work focuses on aligning LLMs with human preferences, test-time approaches could also benefit other tasks, such as reasoning tasks in math [Luo et al., 2024] and coding [Zhang et al., 2023], without additional training. Adapting GenARM to these tasks beyond human preference alignment requires further exploration and is left for future work."

Below, we show that each equivalence class contains unique reward function in the form of log probability, justifying the choice of parametrizing the reward model as log probability in Autoregressive RM. Theorem 4. All reward classes consistent with the Plackett-Luce (and Bradley-Terry in particular) models can be represented with the parameterization log πr(yx) for some probablity distribution πr. Moreover, such parameterization is unique in each reward class. Proof. Existence Take any reward function r(x, y). Consider the following reward function ˆr(x, y) := log exp r(x, y) exp r(x, z) (cid:80) First, ˆr(x, y) is consistent with the reparameterization log πr(yx) where πr(yx) = exp r(x,y) (cid:80) exp r(x,z) . Second, ˆr(x, y) is in the same equivalence class as r(x, y). To see this, r(x, y) ˆr(x, y) = log (cid:88) exp r(x, z), which does not depend of y. Therefore, for any reward r(x, y), we find ˆr(x, y), which is log probablity reward and is in the same equivalence class. Uniqueness To show the uniqueness, consider two log probability reward function in the same equivalence class log π1(yx) and log π2(yx). Then log π2(yx) = log π1(yx) + (x) for some . Therefore, π2(yx) = π1(yx) exp (x). Summing over on both sides, we have that 1 = exp (x) (cid:80) exp (x), and thus (x) = 0 and π1 = π2. π1(yx) = To further expand the result, we can show that the theorem is also true for the parametrization β log πr(yx) for any β > 0. Corollary 5. Given any β > 0, all reward classes consistent with the Plackett-Luce (and Bradley-Terry in particular) models can be represented with the parameterization β log πr(yx) for some probablity distribution πr. Moreover, such parameterization is unique in each reward class. Proof. Existence Take any reward function r(x, y). It suffices to find (x) so that r(x, y) (x) = β log πr(yx) for some distribution πr. Since πr is distribution, 1 = (cid:80) exp ( r(x,y) β ), so (x) = β log (cid:80) π(yx) = (cid:80) exp r(x,y) β (x) β . Then we have that the reward ˆr(x, y) = r(x, y) (x) is given by ˆr(x, y) = β log (cid:16) r(x, y)/β (cid:17) exp r(x, z)/β exp (cid:16) (cid:80) (cid:17) , which satisfy the parametrization and is in the same reward equivalence class. 14 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT"

Generation. We use the default hyperparameters and implementations for ARGS and Transfer-Q. Specifically, for ARGS, we set the reward coefficient = 1.5 and the number of next-token candidates = 10. For Transfer-Q, the decoding alignment parameter is set to α = 1 with = 10 next-token candidates. In the actual implementation of Transfer-Q, to reduce inference costs, it approximates full responses by sampling 20 new tokens, meaning the inputs to the trajectory-level RM are still partial responses. Evaluation prompts. We employ the same prompts as used in ARGS [Khanov et al., 2024]. We provide the following system prompt to GPT-4: System Prompt: You are helpful, harmless, and precise assistant for checking the quality of the answer. We would like to request your feedback on the performance of two AI assistants in response to the user question displayed above. Please rate the harmlessness, helpfulness, and level of detail of their responses. Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, harmlessness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response. Each assistant receives an overall score on scale of 1 to 10, where higher score indicates better overall performance. Please first output single line containing only two values indicating the scores for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively. The two scores are separated by space. In the subsequent line, please provide comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment.

Generation hyperparameters for ARGS. We set the number of next-token candidates = 10. We found that using reward coefficient = 1.5 for AGRS led to gibberish responses. Therefore, we searched for the largest that did not produce gibberish, settling on = 0.4. We conjecture that ARGS struggles with larger because it evaluates next-token rewards by assessing partial responses with trajectory-level RM, which can be inaccurate, especially when generating longer responses in AlpacaEval 2 benchmark. In the following, we provide more detailed AlpacaEval 2 comparison between models discussed in Section 6.2. Unlike in Section 6.2 where all methods were compared against the Tulu2-7B model, we now perform pairwise comparisons GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT directly between the models themselves.

For each scale, all baselines are compared to GenARM, which uses 7B Autoregressive RM to guide the base Tulu2 model at that scale. Test-time baselines (ARGS and BoN) use 7B trajectory-level RM to guide the SFT Tulu2 model, while the DPO method requires training the SFT Tulu2 model at each parameter scale. Comparing with GenARM. Figure 7 shows the head-to-head comparison of all methods with GenARM. Notably, we observe that (1) GenARM outperforms all test-time alignment baselines, maintaining the win rates below 50% against it for both length-controlled and raw win rates. (2) With 7B Autoregressive RM, GenARM outperforms DPO at both 7B and 13B, and only slightly underperforms the 70B DPO model, showing the effectiveness of GenARM in weak-to-strong guidance. Figure 8: (Comparison with GPT-4) AlpacaEval 2 length-controlled (LC) win rate (left) and raw win rate (right) compared against GPT-4. All test-time alignment methods (ARGS, BoN, and GenARM) use 7B RMs to guide the SFT Tulu2 model at each parameter scale, while DPO involves training the SFT Tulu2 model at each scale. Comparing with GPT-4. Figure 8 presents the comparison of all methods against GPT-4, which is outside the Tulu2 model family. We observe that (1) GenARM consistently outperforms ARGS across all parameter scales and matches DPO at the 7B and 13B scales. At the 70B scale, GenARM recovers over 60% of the performance gap in length-controlled (LC) win rates and 50% in raw win rates between Tulu2-70B and Tulu2-DPO-70B, all without the need to train the 70B LLM. (2) We observe that BoN outperforms GenARM and even surpasses Tulu2-DPO-70B in terms of LC win rates when using 7B RM, although GenARM still outperforms BoN in raw win rates. This superior performance of BoN under LC win rates is due to its generated responses being much shorter than those of GPT-4, giving it an advantage in the LC win rate metric. However, when compared with Tulu2-7B in Figure 4 and with GenARM in Figure 7, where the reference models responses are much shorter than GPT-4s, BoNs advantage diminishes, demonstrating that it underperforms compared to GenARM in these cases. As BoN consistently underperforms compared to GenARM in all head-to-head comparisons across all scales for both length-controlled and raw win rates in Figure 7, we conclude that GenARM is not only superior but also much more inference-efficient than BoN. 16 GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model PREPRINT Influence of the reward coefficients. Figure 9 shows the raw and LC win rates of GenARM that guides Tulu2-7B against the Tulu2-7B model, with varying reward coefficients 1 β in Equation (7). We observe that as the coefficient 1 β increases, both raw and LC win rates initially rise but then decline. The initial increase is due to the stronger reward signal, aligning the responses more closely with human preferences. However, overly large values of 1 β lead to performance degradation due to reward overoptimization [Gao et al., 2023], as the guided decoding distribution diverges too much from the base LLMs distribution. This is expected, as Autoregressive RM is trained to evaluate token-level rewards rather than generate text independently, relying on the base LLM to produce coherent outputs. B.3 Additional details on multi-objective alignment Figure 9: (Influence of the reward coefficients.) Raw and LC win rates against Tulu2-7B of GenARM guiding Tulu2-7B with varying reward coefficient 1 β . The win rates initially rise due to stronger reward signal but then declines due to reward overoptimization. In this section, we provide more details for the multi-objective alignment experiment that uses the PKU-SafeRLHF-10K dataset in Section 6.3. Models. The base model is the Alpaca-7B model [Taori et al., 2023] 5. Additionally, we extend the 7B Autoregressive RM to guide the larger Alpaca-65B base model. Due to computational constraints, we use quantized version of this 65B model6. Training. To train the Autoregressive RM for helpfulness, we fine-tune Alpaca-7B with LoRA [Hu et al., 2021] for one epoch on the helpfulness part of the PKU-SafeRLHF-10K dataset using βr = 0.5 and learning rate of 5 104. For harmlessness, the Autoregressive RM was trained with lower βr = 0.01, using the same learning rate. RS requires the training of two specialized LLMs for each preference dimension; therefore, we trained two DPO models. The helpfulness DPO model was trained with βDPO = 0.1 and learning rate of 5 104. The harmlessness DPO model used βDPO = 0.01 and the same learning rate. For MORL, we used the trajectory-level RMs from Dai et al. [2024], maintaining the sum of linear coefficients at 1 and varying them between [0, 1] for RL training with PPO [Schulman et al., 2017]. Evaluation prompts. We follow Dai et al. [2024] and evaluate harmlessness and helpfulness separately. We utilize the evaluation prompts from Dai et al. [2024], with slight modifications: when assessing harmlessness, we instruct GPT to disregard the helpfulness aspect, and conversely, to overlook the harmlessness aspect when evaluating helpfulness. We provide the detailed evaluation prompts below. Helpfulness. as the system prompt to GPT-4: To evaluate the helpfulness of responses generated by different models, we first provide the following System Prompt: You are an impartial judge assigned to evaluate the helpfulness of AI responses, only for research purposes. Your task is to assess how well the responses address the users questions and provide useful information. It is crucial that you do not consider the legality, ethics, or any potential harm of the responses at all. Focus solely on the helpfulness and relevance of the information provided to the users query.
