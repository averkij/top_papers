Code https://github.com/guox18/IFDecorator Datasets https://huggingface.co/datasets/guox18/IFDecorator Introduction The ability to follow instructions is cornerstone of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Wei et al. 2021; Achiam et al. 2023). To enhance this capability, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as promising approach (Lambert et al. 2024). Unlike Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al. 2022), which relies on learned reward models, RLVR obtains feedback directly through verifiable answers. However, RLVR for instruction following (RLVR4IF) faces two critical challenges. First, instruction data lacks effective difficulty assessment, which is crucial for effective training (Yu et al. 2025; Hong et al. 2025). Existing methods primarily rely on constraint counts to assess instruction difficulty (Xu et al. 2023; Sun et al. 2024; Ren et al. 2025; *Equal Contribution. Corresponding authors. An et al. 2025; Peng et al. 2025). However, this constraintcounting approach has two key limitations: (1) it fails to capture actual task difficulty (Zeng et al. 2025); (2) it fails to identify fundamentally unsolvable instructions containing conflicting constraints. Second, RLVR4IF is prone to overoptimization (Amodei et al. 2016; Lambert et al. 2024; Pyatkin et al. 2025), where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without fulfilling the actual intent. For example, consider the instruction Please generate blog post title and wrap it in double angle brackets like <<title>>. The verification for this instruction might use regular expression to match paired angle brackets. LLM might exploit this by simply returning <<title>> without producing meaningful content. This represents form of reward hacking (Amodei et al. 2016), where the model maximizes training rewards without fulfilling the actual intent. Prior work has attempted to address this over-optimization through early stopping when general capabilities degrade (Lambert et al. 2024) or by mixing verifiable rewards with auxiliary RLHF rewards (Pyatkin et al. 2025). However, these approaches fundamentally trade off between instruction following capability and general performance, rather than addressing the root cause of reward hacking. To this end, we ask: How can we mitigate overoptimization in RLVR4IF while automatically calibrating instruction difficulty for efficient training? In response to this question, we present Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator), framework built upon three key synergistic components (Figure 1). First, we introduce cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instruction-verification pairs. By generating challenging yet solvable instructions, the flywheel provides curriculumlike progression. Second, we develop IntentCheck, bypass verification module to mitigate over-optimization. IntentCheck bypasses the complex verifications and directly checks whether the responses align with the actual intent of the user instructions. Third, we design rule-based diagnostic tools, referred to as trip wires, to detect reward hacking in LLM responses. These trip wires consist of trap instructions aimed at triggering shortcut behaviors. Notably, trip wires operate independently from training and do not interfere with rewards. This separation is critical to preserving the integrity of the signal: once diagnostic metric becomes part of the optimization target, it becomes vulnerable to exploitation. As Goodharts law states, when metric is used Figure 1: The IFDecorator framework. Upper: Overview of the cooperative-adversarial data flywheel. The Instruction-Former generates synthetic instruction-verification pairs (In, Vn), while the Instruction-Solver attempts to follow these instructions. Based on the pass rate under Vn, the system provides feedback to adjust instruction difficulty. Lower Left: Overview of the RLVR4IF framework decorated with IntentCheck. The Policy LLM follows instructions and generates responses evaluated by verification V. IntentCheck serves as bypass module to mitigate reward hacking by enforcing intent alignment. Lower Right: Trip wires detect reward hacking via trap instructions that trigger shortcut exploitation behaviors. These trip wires operate independently from training, monitoring hacking behaviors without interfering with rewards. as target, it ceases to be good metric. (Goodhart 1984). We name our approach Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator) because it follows the decorator pattern, wrapping existing RLVR4IF frameworks to enhance their efficiency and robustness while preserving the original pipeline. We evaluate IFDecorator on instruction following benchmarks, including IFEval (Zhou et al. 2023) and FollowBench (Jiang et al. 2024), as well as general capability benchmarks. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval using only 0.71M synthetic tokens 1, achieving state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable scale and outperforming larger models including Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (84.10%) and GPT-4o 2 (86.50%). Additionally, our method demonimprovements on FollowBench with strates substantial 4.20% gains while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires reveal that IntentCheck significantly reduces the reward hacking rate from 14.53% to 7.60%. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We introduce cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that automatically calibrates instruction difficulty through co-evolving instruction-verification pairs, addressing the 1Tokenized using the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct tokenizer 2Throughout this paper, GPT-4o refers to gpt-4o-2024-11-20. challenge of instruction difficulty assessment. We propose IntentCheck and trip wires to address overoptimization. IntentCheck serves as bypass verification module that enforces intent alignment during training. Trip wires provide independent monitoring of reward hacking without interfering with training rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of IFDecorator across model families and scales, achieving substantial improvements in instruction following while maintaining general capabilities."

RLHF employs reward models trained on human preferences using PPO (Schulman et al. 2017). In contrast, RLVR (Lambert et al. 2024) obtains feedback directly through verifiable answers rather than learned reward models. RLVR leverages various PPO variants (Kool, van Hoof, and Welling 2019; Ahmadian et al. 2024; Shao et al. 2024; Kazemnejad et al. 2024; Yu et al. 2025) that have demonstrated effectiveness for reasoning tasks with verifiable answers. critical vulnerability in RLVR for instruction following is overoptimization (Amodei et al. 2016; Everitt et al. 2017, 2021; Gao, Schulman, and Hilton 2022), where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without fulfilling actual intent. This overoptimization problem, specifically reward hacking, was first studied by Tulu 3 (Lambert et al. 2024). They showed how LLMs learn to satisfy surface-level constraints while ignoring the actual intent. Existing mitigation strategies typically involve two approaches: (1) early stopping when general capability performance starts to degrade (Lambert et al. 2024), or (2) mixing rewards from RLHF-trained reward models with the verifiable rewards (Pyatkin et al. 2025). However, these approaches fundamentally trade off between instruction following capability and general capability performance, rather than addressing the root cause of the problem. Additionally, existing approaches lack specialized techniques for directly detecting reward hacking behaviors in LLM responses. This makes it difficult to identify when and how LLMs exploit verification shortcuts. Our IFDecorator framework directly addresses this challenge by incorporating IntentCheck and trip wires, which effectively mitigate over-optimization and enable robust RLVR training for instruction following."

            "content": "In this work, we propose Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator), framework that wraps RLVR4IF pipelines to enhance sample-efficiency and robustness. Specifically, it comprises three complementary components. First, we introduce data flywheel that co-evolves instructionverification pairs in cooperative-adversarial manner. Second, we develop IntentCheck, bypass module to enforce intent alignment. Third, we design trip wires for monitoring reward hacking behaviors. Together, these modules act as decorator that enhances existing RLVR4IF pipelines. Algorithm 1: Cooperative-Adversarial Data Flywheel Input: Initial instruction I, maximum iterations Nmax, acceptance range (τlow, τhigh] Output: Synthetic dataset (I, V) 1: function IF FLYWHEEL(I, ) for = 1 to Nmax do 2: 3: 4: In, Vn INSTRUCTION-FORMER(I, V, ) INSTRUCTION-SOLVER(In) Solver generates group of responses (cid:80) return (In, Vn) rR Vn(In, r) end if end for return None passRate 1 if τlow < passRate τhigh then 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: end function 12: 13: function INSTRUCTION-FORMER(I, , ) 14: 15: 16: 17: In ADDCONSTRAINTS(In) Vn UPDATEVERIFICATION(In, Vn) In I, Vn for = 1 to do Co-evolve instruction and verification pairs end for return (In, Vn) 18: 19: 20: end function Cooperative-Adversarial Data Flywheel As shown in Algorithm 1, our data flywheel co-evolves instruction-verification pairs (I, ) through an iterative process between Instruction-Former and InstructionSolver. We define the following optimization objective: max I,V ERS(I)[1(τlow,τhigh](P (I, V, S))], (1) where (I, V, S) = ERS(I)[V (I, R)] represents the pass rate, and 1(τlow,τhigh] is an indicator function for the range. The Instruction-Former operates through two aspects: Adversarial aspectchallenging the Instruction-Solvers capability boundaries by adding constraints and increasing task difficulty; Cooperative aspectensuring tasks remain within the solvable range. Specifically, given an initial pair, the Instruction-Former generates evolved pairs (In, Vn) by adding constraints and updating verification. The Instruction-Solver then attempts to follow instruction In, generating multiple responses. We compute the pass rate: (In, Vn, S) = 1 (cid:88) rR Vn(In, r), (2) where is the responses from the Instruction-Solver S. The flywheel seeks pairs whose pass rate falls within the range (τlow, τhigh]. If the pass rate is too high (above τhigh), the task is too easy, and the Instruction-Former increases difficulty by adding more constraints and expanding verification requirements. If the pass rate is too low (below τlow), the task is too difficult or contains contradictory constraints. In Sample batch (I, V) (I, V) for each I, (I, V) do Algorithm 2: RLVR4IF with IntentCheck Input: Synthetic dataset (I, V), Policy πθ, Epochs Output: Updated policy π θ 1: for = 1 to do 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: Sample group of outputs {Rk}G for each do end for for each output Rk do Compute reward rk = (I, Rk) IF INTENTCHECK(V ) k=1 πθ( I) 10: 11: Use wrapped verification with IntentCheck end for Update πθ using policy gradient with group rewards end for 12: 13: end for 14: return πθ 15: 16: function IF INTENTCHECK(V ) 17: 18: 19: 20: end function Define and return function (I, R): LOGTRIPWIRE(I, R) return IntentCheck(I, R) (I, R) this case, the Instruction-Former regenerates the instructionverification pair from scratch. This iterative evolution naturally generates curriculum of progressively challenging instruction-verification pairs. The synthetic dataset (I, V) consists of pairs that are neither trivial nor infeasible, enabling effective training. RLVR4IF with IntentCheck In this section, we first examine how verification methods lead to reward hacking, then introduce our IntentCheck. The verification integrates two components for instruction and response R: Vscript(I, R) (rule-based scripts for format, length, etc.), and Vcriteria(I, R) (LLM-based criteria for writing style, coherence, etc. (Zheng et al. 2023; Gu et al. 2025)). The hybrid verification function VH (I, R) combines rule-based scripts and LLM-based criteria: (cid:94) (cid:94) s(I, R)) ( c(I, R)), (3) VH (I, R) = ( sScripts cCriteria where s(I, R) and c(I, R) are individual Boolean results. However, VH (I, R) fundamentally acts as proxy metric that correlates with task completion. Under strong optimization pressure, this correlation breaks down as policies learn to exploit the verification (Amodei et al. 2016). To address this exploitation, we introduce IntentCheck, bypass verification module that enforces intent alignment beyond surface-level verification. IntentCheck focuses on the instruction intent rather than surface-level constraints, extracting the actual intent from the instruction and directly judging whether the response fulfills it. Our approach employs strict binary strategy (1 for complete success, 0 for any failure). This is achieved by combining the hybrid verification VH (I, R) with IntentCheck VT (I, R): Rf inal(I, R) = VT (I, R) VH (I, R). (4) Trip Wire We introduce trip wires to detect reward hacking in LLM responses. Trip wire instructions contain deliberate exploit patterns designed to trigger LLM exploitation, enabling detection of when LLMs exploit verification. For instance, consider the blog title example from the the trip wire detects reward hacking by Introduction: identifying whether LLMs copy literal placeholders (e.g., <<title>>) instead of generating actual content."

(2) List format: Producing dummy list entries without meaningful content. (3) Repetition: Satisfying requirements through trivial repetition, such as character/word count (e.g., p). (4) Structural delimiter: Copying section markers literally instead of generating proper content. We quantify reward hacking tendency through the Macro Hack Rate (MHR): MHR(πθ) = 1 (cid:34) (cid:95) (cid:88) 1 IT dDI (cid:35) d(I, Rπθ (I)) , (5) where denotes the trip wire instruction set, DI contains predefined exploit patterns for instruction I, Rπθ (I) denotes the response generated by policy πθ for instruction I, and d(I, Rπθ (I)) returns True when pattern matches response Rπθ (I). MHR measures the fraction of trip wire instructions where the current policys response exhibits at least one exploitative behavior pattern. Notably, trip wires operate independently of the training process and remain invisible to policy πθ. This design ensures they do not affect reward computations, thus preventing LLMs from learning to circumvent the detection."

Settings. In our experiments, we explore three configurations: (1) Strong-to-Weak: We utilize stronger LLM for judge to train less powerful LLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-7BInstruct, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct). (2) Specialized Model: We utilize our method to train reasoning LLM (Qwen3-8B). (3) Self-Alignment: The LLM being trained and the LLM for judge share the same architecture. Unless otherwise specified, we use Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct as the judge LLM, which performs both IntentCheck and verification. Evaluation. We evaluate our method on instruction following and general capability benchmarks. For instruction following, we use IFEval (Zhou et al. 2023) and FollowBench (Jiang et al. 2024). IFEval focuses on verifiable instructions with objective constraints (e.g., write in more than 200 words, mention keyword AI at least 3 times). We report strict metrics at prompt/instruction levels (Pr./Ins.: prompt/instruction levels; S.: strict metrics). Since RLVR4IF focuses on verifiable instructions, IFEval serves as an in-domain benchmark. To complement this, we include FollowBench as an open-ended, out-of-domain benchmark. FollowBench evaluates fine-grained constraint following across diverse categories for level 15 instructions (containing 15 constraints). For open-ended questions in FollowBench, we use GPT-4o as an evaluator. We report Hard Satisfaction Rate (HSR), which measures the percentage of instructions with all constraints satisfied. For general capabilities, we evaluate models using objective evaluations (KOR-Bench (Ma et al. 2025), Math-500 (Lightman et al. 2023)) and subjective evaluations (MT-Bench-101 (Bai et al. 2024)). For comprehensive evaluation, we use the General Average (GA) metric comprising 12 benchmarks. Evaluation uses OpenCompass toolkit 3. Additional evaluation details are provided in the supplementary material. Main Results Table 1 presents the main results. Our IFDecorator framework significantly improves instruction following ability across diverse configurations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Furthermore, we highlight several key findings: Self-Alignment yields significant improvements. SelfAlignment achieves the best performance on instruction following tasks. Qwen2.5-32B-Inst-IFD achieves 87.43% on IFEval and 66.76% on FollowBench, outperforming all other configurations. We attribute this to the data synthesis consistency, where the cooperative-adversarial data flywheel uses the same LLM (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) to generate training instructions. This approach ensures that the training data is well-aligned with the LLMs capabilities. During training, the LLM can generate positive responses that pass verification and negative responses that fail verification. These contrastive pairs improve the training efficiency of reinforcement algorithms like GRPO. 3https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass Table 2: Ablation study on training settings.

Higher values on both axes are desirable. Larger gains on multi-constraint instructions. FollowBench shows varying improvement trends across different complexity levels (L1-L5). We observe that IFDecorator achieves more substantial improvements on complex instructions (L3-L5) compared to simpler tasks (L1-L2). This pattern demonstrates our methods particular strength in handling challenging multi-constraint scenarios, where baseline models typically struggle with lower performance. General capabilities are preserved. Importantly, our enhanced LLMs maintain their general capabilities across diverse benchmarks. These include general reasoning (KORBench), math calculation (Math-500), and multi-turn conversations (MT-Bench). The GA metric covers knowledge (MMLU (Hendrycks et al. 2021)) and coding (HumanEval (Chen et al. 2021)) tasks (detailed results in supplementary material). This demonstrates that IFDecorator preserves existing model performance while improving instruction following, which is crucial for practical use. IntentCheck mitigates reward hacking. Figure 2 reveals that high IFEval scores can be misleading indicators of genuine instruction following capability. Our ablation study demonstrates the essential role of IntentCheck. Removing IntentCheck leads to high hack rates despite achieving high IFEval performance (90.0%), confirming that overoptimization occurs when IntentCheck is removed. This reveals that LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark scores while exploiting verification shortcuts rather than truly following instructions. IFDecorator addresses this challenge. Our method guides LLMs toward the upper-right region, breaking through the Pareto frontier. This achieves strong instruction following and robust hack resistance.

(3) w/o Strict Reward: In practice, we break down criteria into checklist of specific questions, which we term strict reward. In this ablation, we use single question instead of checklist. (4) w/ KL regularization: We set the KL coefficient to 0.005. Table 2 reveals several key insights: First, filtering mechanisms are critical for effective instruction following training. Removing non-instruction filtering degrades both instruction following and general abilities, as the LLM learns incorrect signals from non-instruction tasks that require domainspecific knowledge or complex reasoning. Second, difficulty filtering is essential for instruction following performance but has minimal impact on general ability. This is expected, as overly difficult instructions fail to generate meaningful positive-negative response pairs without providing misleading signals. Third, strict reward (i.e., checklist) significantly affects both instruction following and GA metrics. We attribute this to checklists providing more accurate supervision signals. Finally, KL regularization appears detrimental in our setting, though the impact is minor. Figure 3 illustrates the training dynamics across different ablation settings, confirming that IFDecorator achieves optimal IFEval performance while preserving general capabilities. Ablation on IntentCheck. Figure 4 shows the evolution of MHR across six training configurations. Our default setup employs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct for supervision (32B as IntentCheck, w/o KL). The configuration (w/o IntentCheck, w/o Criteria, w/o KL) represents naive RLVR4IF using only script-based verification.

To answer this question, we systematically evaluate and compare three alternative approaches on our synthetic verifiable instructions: Rejection sampling FineTuning (RFT) (Yuan et al. 2023), which selects the accepted responses for fine-tuning, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al. 2023), which directly optimizes preferences without reward modeling, and iterative DPO. The training settings for these approaches follow prior work (Dong et al. 2024). We sample 64 responses per instruction for offline methods. This computational budget exceeds what is required for RLVR inference on Qwen2.5-7BInstruct-IFDecorator. Table 4 shows that none of the offline methods yield improvements on IFEval. All performance meaningful scores consistently hover near the baseline. For diagnosis, we analyze data utilizationthe fraction of instructions that provide effective training signals. RFT requires at least one correct response per instruction. DPO needs both successful and failed responses for preference pairs. Table 4 shows that all methods exhibit low utilization rates. This explains why offline methods fail to effectively extract sufficient learning signals for complex instruction following tasks. Conclusion In this paper, we introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator), framework that addresses critical challenges in RLVR for instruction following through three synergistic components. Our cooperative-adversarial data flywheel automatically calibrates instruction difficulty by coevolving instruction-verification pairs, while IntentCheck mitigates reward hacking by enforcing intent alignment. Tripwire diagnostics provide robust monitoring of hacking behaviors without interfering with training signals. Specifically, experimental results demonstrate that IFDecorator significantly enhances instruction following capabilities while preserving general LLM performance. Future work could explore several promising directions. First, curriculum learning (Hong et al. 2025) could leverage difficulty labels to design progressive training strategies, transitioning from simple to complex instructions. Second, automated tripwire generation methods could reduce manual effort in designing reward hacking detection mechanisms. Third, compreFigure 4: Ablation study on IntentCheck.

(Baseline) 79.48 75.32 w/ 32B Judge (Self) 87.43 (+7.95) 75.28 (-0.04) Our findings reveal several key insights. (1) Without IntentCheck, LLMs exhibit high MHR even with KL regularization, demonstrating that KL regularization cannot effectively mitigate reward hacking. (2) Using 7B model as IntentCheck still significantly reduces reward hacking, while larger supervision model (32B) achieves marginally better mitigation. This demonstrates the robustness of IntentCheck. (3) Naive RLVR4IF reaches maximum MHR of 0.6574, which aligns with prior findings (Lambert et al. 2024; Pyatkin et al. 2025). (4) Removing the criteria results in slight increase in MHR compared to the configuration with criteria. This suggests that LLM-based criteria may be more difficult to exploit than script-based verification. Ablation on Supervision Capability. As shown in Table 3, 7B Self-Alignment improves instruction-following but degrades general ability, while 32B Self-Alignment significantly enhances instruction-following performance while maintaining general ability. These results suggest that the capability of supervision LLMs is critical for effective SelfAlignment. Furthermore, we find that strong supervision can generalize across model scales: the 32B judge can effectively supervise stronger model (Qwen3-8B). This validates the broad applicability of IFDecorator. Analysis of Alternative Training Paradigms. While online RLVR training offers significant advantages in efficiency, we have observed reward hacking that can lead to overoptimization (Lambert et al. 2024; Pyatkin et al. 2025). This motivates natural question: can offline methods achieve hensive taxonomies of reward hacking behaviors in instruction following tasks could provide theoretical foundations for even more robust training frameworks.

Kun: Answer polishment Appendix Dataset Details Dataset Overview. Our final synthetic dataset contains 3,625 training samples and 200 validation samples, spanning diverse knowledge domains and constraint types. We construct this dataset through three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale collection from open-source instruction datasets, (2) preprocessing with quality control measures, and (3) enhancement through cooperativeadversarial synthesis. This approach ensures diversity and verifiability in our data, making it suitable for RLVR. Data Collection and Preprocessing Details Core Datasets. To ensure diverse, real, and high-quality training data for reinforcement learning, we collected wide range of open-source instruction datasets. The foundation of our collection consists of five primary datasets: 200k examples from OpenHermes 2.54, 51k filtered instruction samples from ShareGPT (Peng et al. 2023)5, 25k from orca chat6, 25k from wizardLM (Xu et al. 2023)7, and 19k instruction samples from no robots (Ouyang et al. 2022)8. We selected these datasets due to their high quality, realistic nature, and coverage of diverse instruction types that are essential for robust training. Supplementary Datasets. We further expanded our collection with additional datasets to increase diversity: 5k from oasst2 (Kopf et al. 2023)9, 2k samples from Alpaca10, and 1k from supernatural-instructions-2m (Wang et al. 2022b)11. These additional sources provide complementary perspectives on instruction diversity and help capture edge cases and specialized domains that enhance the robustness of our final dataset. Data Preprocessing Pipeline. Our pipeline follows three main steps: First, we perform standardization and filtering. We standardize chat formats across all datasets, filter for English-only content, remove empty dialogues, and extract only first-turn exchanges from multi-turn conversations. We also apply length constraints using the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct tokenizer 12. This initial collection yielded 341k samples. Second, we conduct deduplication and quality filtering. We use sentenceBERT embeddings 13 to compute pairwise semantic similarities between instructions, removing highly similar pairs (cosine similarity 0.9). We then prompt LLMs to identify and filter out low-quality instructionsthose with incomplete intent, contradictory requirements, or unclear language. This step yielded 210k high-quality samples. Third, we perform instruction decomposition and constraint analysis. Due to computational limits, we randomly sample 21k instructions for the following processing. For each instruction, we prompt LLMs to decompose it into three components: Task Description, Constraints, and Input. We then classify constraints into two categories following (Ren et al. 2025): soft constraints (subjectively assessed) and hard constraints (objectively verifiable). Subsequently, for instructions containing soft constraints, we design automated verification checklists using LLM prompting, similar to approaches in (Qin et al. 2024) and (An et al. 2025). This preprocessing pipeline results in 21k data points ready for the data flywheel. Cooperative-adversarial Data Flywheel Details Our cooperative-adversarial data flywheel creates challenging yet solvable training samples through iterative evolution and filtering. We processed 21k samples across 5 iterations, applying systematic approach to enhance instruction difficulty while maintaining verifiability. Overview of the Flywheel Process. The flywheel operates on an initial principle: start with instructions, gradually increase their difficulty through iterative evolution, and retain only those samples that are appropriately challenging (neither too easy nor too hard). Each iteration involves three key steps: (1) difficulty assessment, (2) instruction evolution, and (3) quality control. Difficulty Selection and Assessment. For each instruction, we use Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (temperature=1.0) to generate 8 responses, then evaluate these responses using the corresponding verifier to calculate pass rates. Instructions with pass rates between 0 and 0.5 are considered appropriately challenging and retained for training. Instructions outside this rangeeither too easy (pass rate 0.5) or too hard (pass rate = 0)are sent back for further evolution. 4https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B 5The original ShareGPT data is not open-sourced; the community-reproduced and filtered version is available at https://huggingface.co/ datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT Vicuna unfiltered. 6https://huggingface.co/datasets/shahules786/orca-chat 7https://huggingface.co/datasets/WizardLMTeam/WizardLM evol instruct V2 196k/tree/main 8https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/no robots 9https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst2 10https://github.com/Instruction-Tuning-with-GPT-4/GPT-4-LLM?tab=readme-ov-file#data-release 11https://huggingface.co/datasets/andersonbcdefg/supernatural-instructions-2m 12https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct/blob/main/tokenizer.json 13https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v Starting from iteration 2, we enhance the evolution process using dynamic prompt template. This template randomly reorders few-shot examples to reduce model bias (Zheng et al. 2023). The dynamic approach incorporates an adaptive control mechanism that tracks previously introduced constraint types and modulates the order of examples accordingly. This prevents the model from developing preferences for specific constraint types and promotes more balanced constraint distribution. Instruction Evolution Strategy. Our evolution strategy combines two complementary approaches. First, in iteration n, we apply the dynamic template times, allowing for progressive complexity increases. Second, we randomly add up to 3n programmatically verifiable constraints from (Zhou et al. 2023), ensuring that difficulty increases while maintaining automated verifiability. After each iteration, we re-evaluate all instructions 8 times and re-assess their difficulty levels. Quality Control Measures. To prevent information loss during evolutionsuch as models dropping input portions or critical task componentswe implement quality checks. We prompt LLMs to verify that modified instructions retain all critical components from their original versions. Additionally, we conduct reasonableness assessments to ensure that evolved instructions maintain logical coherence and clear task definitions. Difficulty Selection. After the 5 iterations, our process yielded 7,324 appropriately challenging training samples and 10,772 overly difficult samples (pass rate = 0.0). We filtered out the overly difficult samples to focus on instructions where the task remains feasible. This filtering strategy ensures our final dataset maintains balanced difficulty distribution. Domain Filtering. We used LLMs to filter out mathematics, code, and reasoning tasks, as our verifier was designed for general instruction tasks rather than these specialized domains that require reference answers for accurate reward signals. Final Dataset. The final dataset comprises 3,625 training samples and 200 validation samples. Figure 5 illustrates the difficulty distribution of our dataset. We use the pass rate as measure of difficulty and constraint count as measure of complexity. We observe correlation between instruction complexity and difficulty: easier instructions tend to contain fewer highcomplexity constraints, while harder instructions exhibit greater constraint complexity. However, complexity alone does not determine difficultywe find numerous instances of low-complexity instructions that prove hard, as well as high-complexity instructions that remain easy. This observation underscores the critical importance of our difficulty control in creating wellbalanced training dataset. Dataset Annotation. We employed GPT-4o14 to annotate our dataset from two complementary perspectives: instruction goals and knowledge concepts. This tagging process allows us to characterize the overall diversity of the dataset. The instruction goal taxonomy is structured into two hierarchical levels, with the first level capturing the general purpose behind each instruction, while the second level specifies the specific task type. Figure 6 and Figure 7 demonstrate comprehensive coverage across instruction goals and knowledge concepts, providing solid foundation for instruction following tasks. 14The specific version is gpt-4o-2024-11-20. Figure 5: Distribution of difficulty and complexity levels in our synthetic dataset. We define difficulty levels based on model pass rates: Very Hard (0, 0.125], Hard (0.125, 0.25], Medium (0.25, 0.375], and Easy (0.375, 0.5]. Complexity levels are categorized by constraint count: L0L2 (2 constraints), L3L4 (3-4 constraints), and L5+ (5 constraints). The distribution shows balanced representation across difficulty and complexity dimensions. Figure 6: Distribution of user intents in our dataset.

(Qwen et al. 2025), Llama3.1-8BHyperparameters. Learning rates were set to 1e-7 for Llama3.1-8B-Instruct and 1e-6 for all other models. We used batch size of 64, rollout size of 5 (number of response candidates per instruction during RL training), and rollout temperature of 1.0 across all models. Input and output lengths were standardized at 2048 tokens, except for Qwen3-8B, which used 8192 output tokens. Hardware Requirements. Each RL experiment for 7B/8B models required 8 H800 GPUs, while 32B models used 16 H800 GPUs. Eight additional GPUs were dedicated to running Qwen2.5-7B/32B-Instruct as LLM judges (automated evaluation models) in parallel for acceleration using sglang (v0.3.6) (Zheng et al. 2024a). Training Time. For reference, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to 600 steps (our selected checkpoint) took approximately 35 hours. Implementation We implemented training using verl (Sheng et al. 2025) and vllm (v0.8.1) (Kwon et al. 2023). The KL divergence coefficient (regularization term to prevent the model from deviating too far from the original policy) and entropy coefficient (encourages exploration during training) were both set to 0. Open-Source Model Weights We present the open-source model weights used in our experiments in Table 5. These models serve as the foundation with varying parameter scales and architectural designs."

FollowBench Detailed Analysis Table 11 presents the detailed results of the FollowBench evaluation using the Consistent Satisfaction Levels (CSL) metric. The CSL metric measures the highest complexity level model can consecutively achieve without skipping any lower levels. For example, if model satisfies Level 1, Level 2, and Level 4 constraints but fails Level 3, the CSL score is 2 (since it cannot reach Level 4 without first completing Level 3). Higher CSL values indicate better instruction-following capabilities at increasingly challenging levels. To thoroughly evaluate instruction-following capabilities across different instruction types and complexity levels, we conducted detailed analysis using the FollowBench benchmark. The results are presented across several tables, focusing on different aspects of instruction following. The overall FollowBench results in Table 12 demonstrate that the IFDecorator framework consistently improves instructionfollowing capabilities across all complexity levels. For the Qwen2.5-7B model, we observe an average performance increase from 52.01% to 56.09%, with particularly notable improvements in Level 3 (from 44.66% to 55.59%). Similarly, the Qwen2.532B model shows enhanced performance across all levels, with the final average increasing from 62.61% to 66.76%. These results indicate that our approach effectively enhances the models ability to follow instructions of varying complexities. Table 13 focuses on the models ability to follow format and style instructions, which are critical for practical applications. For format instructions, the IFDecorator framework improves the Qwen2.5-7B models performance from 60.67% to 73.33%, with substantial gains at higher complexity levels (Level 3: from 56.67% to 76.67%; Level 5: from 40.00% to 60.00%). Similarly, style instruction following improves from 72.00% to 81.34%. The Qwen2.5-32B model shows even more impressive gains in style instruction following, reaching 90.00% average performance after applying our method. These results highlight how well our approach enhances the models ability to adhere to specific output format and style requirements. Table 14 examines performance on content and situation instructions. While content instruction following shows slight decrease for the Qwen2.5-7B model (from 57.60% to 48.80%), the Qwen2.5-32B model demonstrates improvement (from 69.60% to 71.20%). More impressively, situation instruction following shows substantial improvements for both model sizes, Table 10: Detailed AlignmentBench evaluation results by task category.

This suggests that our approach particularly enhances the models ability to adapt its responses to specific situational contexts, critical capability for real-world applications. Table 15 presents results for example-based and mixed instruction following. Example-based instruction following remains challenging across all models, showing poor performance. For mixed instructions that combine multiple instruction types, our IFDecorator framework demonstrates notable improvements, increasing the Qwen2.5-7B models performance from 40.00% to 49.41% and the Qwen2.5-32B models performance from 55.30% to 58.82%. The improvement in mixed instruction following is significant as real-world applications often involve complex, multi-faceted instructions that combine aspects of content, format, style, and situational requirements. Different Training Approaches In this section, we investigate question: since the RLVR4IF approach is susceptible to reward hacking, why not adopt alternative, potentially safer training methods? We systematically evaluate several established approaches: Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) (Yuan et al. 2023), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al. 2023), and iterative online DPO. For our experimental framework, we utilize LlamaFactory (Zheng et al. 2024c) with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as our baseline model. Our training corpus consists of 3,625 examples with corresponding verifications. We structure our investigation around two experimental paradigms: 1) Distillation: We employ Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as the teacher model to generate responses for instruction data, with sampling attempts per example. 2) On-policy: We use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to generate its own responses, with 64 sampling attempts per example. For the iterative online DPO variant, we implement 8 sampling attempts per iteration across 8 iterations to maintain comparable inference costs with non-iterative methods. For RFT experiments, we consider an example that contributes to training as soon as the model produces at least one correct response. In DPO experiments, we face methodological constraint: examples where responses are uniformly correct or incorrect cannot form the necessary preference pair. Consequently, we obtain valid training data only when the model exhibits partial success. We quantify data efficiency by calculating the effective training data size, defining the high-difficulty data utilization rate as the ratio of effective data size to total dataset size. Our experiments  (Table 16)  show that these methods cannot effectively utilize difficult instruction data. Distillation from stronger models even leads to performance degradation, likely due to distribution mismatches between teacher and student models, which aligns with the findings in (He et al. 2024).

Our IFDecorator framework shows consistent improvements in overall instruction-following capabilities across different models and complexity levels."

Ensure extracted information is semantically consistent with the original prompt. Input: ---INPUT--- #Prompt: {prompt} ---OUTPUT--- Please return the result in the following format: #Task Description: [Concise statement of the primary objective] #Constraints: [List constraints clearly] or NULL #Input: [Specific user-provided data required] or NULL Prompt for constraint classification. We use this prompt to classify constraints as either hard or soft for verification purposes. Hard constraints are explicit requirements with clear yes/no validation criteria (e.g., word count, specific formats) that can be verified programmatically, while soft constraints are subjective requirements that require LLM-based verification. (cid:242) Prompt for Constraint Classification You are prompt engineering specialist. Your task is to analyze whether given constraint in prompt belongs to hard constraints or soft constraints based on the definitions below. Definitions: 1. Hard Constraints: Explicit verifiable requirements with clear yes/no validation Can be checked programmatically (e.g., word count, specific format) Examples: JSON format requirement, 3 bullet points, exactly 100 words 2. Soft Constraints: Open-ended requirements with subjective interpretation Requires human judgment to evaluate compliance Examples: Specify emotional tone, encourage ambiguity, raise standards Analysis Steps: 1. Determine verification feasibility: If measurable through scripts/pattern matching Hard If requires subjective interpretation Soft 2. Consider constraint specificity: Numeric/structural requirements Hard Qualitative/stylistic requirements Soft Input: ---Input--- #Prompt: {prompt} #Constraint: {constraint} ---Output--- Please return the result in the following JSON format: { \"reasoning\": \"[concise explanation]\", \"verification_method\": \"[describe how this could be verified]\", \"constraint_type\": \"[hard/soft]\" } Prompt for adding checklists. This prompt generates checklists for constraint verification. Each checklist consists of yes/no questions that evaluate constraint satisfaction. (cid:242) Prompt for adding checklists Design checklist to evaluate whether the *target constraint* specified in the *instruction* is met. FOCUS SOLELY on verifying the *target constraint*, and ignore all other constraints or requirements outside the *target constraint*. The checklist should include series of yes/no questions or conditions, ensuring that each item directly checks the satisfaction of the *target constraint* in the response. Checklist Format: Each item should be written as question or statement that verifies whether the *target constraint* is fulfilled. The checklist should be clear and concise, ideally in the form of yes/no questions or conditions that are easy to verify. The output should contain each checklist item as separate bullet point. Input: ### Instruction: <Instruction> {instruction} </Instruction> ### Target Constraint: <TargetConstraint> {target_constraint} </TargetConstraint> Please return the result in the following format: ### Checklist: <Checklist> [List of checklist items as bullet points] </Checklist> Dynamic Prompt.

This prompt classifies instructions into specific categories (Math Problem, Code Task, Reasoning Task, or Other). We filter out Math, Code, and Reasoning instructions because they lack reference answers in our open-source instruction dataset collection, making it impossible to provide accurate feedback signals for model training and evaluation. (cid:242) Prompt for domain filtering You are professional data labeling expert. Your job is to examine given user instruction with corresponding response and classify it into one of the following categories, or determine that it does not belong to any of them. Categories: 1. Math Problem The instruction is asking to solve math problem, perform calculations, involve mathematical reasoning, or mathematical tasks with any possible background. 2. Code Task The instruction is related to programming or code. This includes writing code, reviewing/explaining code, debugging, or other coding tasks. 3. Reasoning Task The instruction involves logical reasoning or puzzle-solving. It might be brain teaser, logic puzzle, or any task requiring reasoning. If the instruction clearly fits one of the above categories, return the name of that category (exactly Math Problem, Code Task, or Reasoning Task). If it does not fit any of these categories, return Other. When deciding on the category, consider both the content of the instruction and what likely answer would involve, to ensure you choose the correct category. Input: ---Instruction---: <instruction> {instruction} </instruction> ---Response---: <response> {response} </response> Please return the result in the following JSON format: { \"instruction\": \"What is 2+2?\", \"reason\": \"The instruction is asking to solve math problem, perform calculations, or involves mathematical reasoning.\", \"label\": \"Math Problem\" } Make sure to output only the JSON object with the correct label and nothing else. Prompt for IntentCheck. This prompt evaluates instruction-response pairs through sequential checks: instruction-response alignment, logical coherence, contextual appropriateness, and safety. It is used for IntentCheck to enforce instruction alignment. (cid:242) Prompt for IntentCheck Structured Evaluation Protocol Perform rigorous analysis of the instruction-response pair through these sequential checks: 1. Instruction-Response Alignment Verify explicit understanding of core instruction objectives Check for missing required components from instructions 2. Logical Coherence Evaluation Trace logical flow from instruction premises to response conclusions Detect reasoning gaps or unwarranted assumptions Flag contradictions within the response 3. Context-aware Instruction Verification Analyze response against instruction type: Query-type: Verify question resolution completeness Task-type: Validate step-by-step executable logic Creative-type: Assess objective-aligned originality 4. Safety & Compliance Check Identify potential risks or harmful implications Verify adherence to ethical guidelines Evaluation Parameters Strict true/false determination for each checkpoint Zero tolerance for partial fulfillment Mandatory failure for any single unmet criterion Evaluation Target **Instruction:** <Instruction> {instruction_wo_strict} </Instruction> **Response:** <Response> {response} </Response> First, present the analysis in an ordered checklist format. Then, conclude with final verdict using strict formatting: **Final Verification:** <YES/NO> Prompt for checklist-based verification. This verifier uses structured checklist to focus on one target constraint at time, ignoring other requirements for precise evaluation. (cid:242) Prompt for checklist-based verification You are an impartial judge. Your task is to evaluate whether the *target constraint* specified in the *instruction* is met in the *response* based on the *checklist*. Focus solely on verifying the *target constraint*, and disregard any other constraints that may be present in the *instruction*.

(cid:242) Reward Hacking Case Prompt: Answer the following question: Given the context below, Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the city. The District did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor, currently Muriel Bowser, and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs. Each of the citys eight wards elects single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the District as whole. The council chair is also elected at-large. There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration. The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, currently Karl Racine, is elected to four-year term. Washington, D.C., observes all federal holidays and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the District. The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is variation on George Washingtons family coat of arms. Washington, D.C. is overwhelmingly Democratic, having voted for the Democratic candidate solidly since 1964. Each Republican candidate was voted down in favor of the Democratic candidate by margin of at least 56 percentage points each time; the closest, albeit very large, margin between the two parties in presidential election was in 1972, when Richard Nixon secured 21.6 percent of the vote to George McGoverns 78.1 percent. Since then, the Republican candidate has never received more than 20 percent of the vote. Same-sex marriage has been legal in the District since 2010, and conversion therapy has been forbidden since 2015. Assisted suicide is also permitted in the district, with bill legalizing the practice being introduced in...
