            "content": "Although neural ranking models have made signiﬁcant progress in recent years [7, 13, 21, 22, 27] and led to substantial performance gains on standard benchmarks such as MS MARCO [19] and the TREC Deep Learning (DL) Track [3, 4], we observe that they often struggle with reasoning-intensive queries that demand deeper understanding and explicit justiﬁcation of relevance decisions. For instance, state-of-the-art dense retrievers that achieve strong performance on TREC DL show signiﬁcant degradation on reasoning-intensive queries, with the best models achieving only about 18% nDCG@10 on the BRIGHT benchmark [29]a recent benchmark designed for reasoning-intensive ranking tasks. We argue that ranking models must engage in deliberate reasoning to bridge the gap between query intent and document content. Recent work has suggested that large language models with tens of billions of parameters can eﬀectively serve as zero-shot rerankers [23, 24, 30], demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. However, deploying these models at scale remains challenging due to their computational requirements and latency constraints. While smaller models oﬀer practical advantages, they typically lack the sophisticated reasoning abilities of their larger counterparts. Recent LLMs such as DeepSeek R1 [5] have demonstrated that encouraging models to learn explicit reasoning strategies and leveraging inference-time compute for stepby-step analysis can signiﬁcantly improve performance on complex tasks. While this has been demonstrated for language modeling and generation tasks, exploring these principles in retrieval remains understudied. Our work shows that by decomposing document relevance assessment into explicit reasoning steps and optimizing for high-quality explanations, we can achieve strong performance even with relatively compact models. In more detail, our work introduces framework for distilling and reﬁning reasoning capabilities in small language models for reasoning-intensive ranking. Our approach does not require any manually labeled data for training; instead, we perform diverse data scraping approach from the Web for collecting reasoning intensive questions and pseudo-labeling approach using teacher LLM (with 70B parameters), resulting in dataset with 20K examples. We then introduce knowledge distillation approach that helps compact student LLM (with 3B parameters) to mimic the reasoning and labeling capability of the teacher. Subsequently, we introduce reinforcement learning approach that reﬁnes these reasoning capabilities by rewarding high-quality explanations and accurate relevance predictions. Through this approach, we demonstrate that our eﬃcient 3B parameter model achieves performance comparable to 70B+ parameter models on reasoning-intensive ranking tasks. Most notably, our model ranks third on the BRIGHT benchmark leaderboard and is the ﬁrst eﬀective ranking model under 8B parameters, with the only models achieving better performance being 70B zero-shot ranker using GPT-4 for query reformulation and JudgeRank, an ensemble of three LLMs (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters). Our 3B parameter model outperforms all other baseline methods on the BRIGHT benchmark, including recent approaches like Reason-toRank [12] which uses an 8B parameter model, while using almost three times fewer parameters and avoiding complex query rewriting or multi-step prompting strategies. We release our code and data for improved reproducibility.1 1https://github.com/algoprog/InteRank SIGIR25, July 2025, Padova, Italy"

            "content": "First-stage Retrieval: lightweight sparse or dense retrieval model is used to retrieve potentially relevant documents from the corpus. To better understand the impact of retrieval quality on the ﬁnal ranking performance, we experiment with various retrievers, including BM25 [26] and dense embedding models (see section 3). We retrieve the top 100 documents for re-ranking. While optimizing the ﬁrst-stage retriever is important, in this work we focus on improving the second-stage re-ranking component. Second-stage Re-ranking: Various learning-to-rank models, from traditional feature-based [2, 17] to transformer-based crossencoder models [8, 21, 22], have been used for reranking. We aim at training reranking model for eﬀective reasoning-intensive tasks. To do so, we train language model that takes query-document pair at time and generates some reasoning to analyze and describe whether and how the provided document is relevant. These reasoning steps are then followed by discrete relevance label as the ﬁnal generation token. This relevance label is either 0 (i.e., nonrelevant), 1 (partially relevant), or 2 (highly relevant). This stage is crucial for complex reasoning tasks, as it allows deeper analysis of document content in relation to the query intent. Since the scores produced by our reranker are discrete, many documents are assigned the same relevance score, and we cannot distinguish them in ranking. Therefore, we employ hybrid scoring strategy that combines the generated discrete reranking score with the retrieval score produced in the ﬁrst-stage retrieval. In fact, score(𝑞, 𝑑) = retrieval score(𝑞, 𝑑) + 𝛼 reranking score(𝑞, 𝑑) where 𝑞 and 𝑑 denote query and document and 𝛼 R+ is hyperparameter controlling the impact of re-ranking score. 𝛼 is expected to be relatively high number 1.

The process consists of three phases:",
            "content": "1. Synthetic Data Generation: High-quality training data is crucial for developing models that can handle diverse reasoning patterns. However, obtaining human annotations for reasoningintensive ranking is expensive and time-consuming. We address this challenge through an automated data generation process that leverages existing question-answer pairs from social websites like StackExchange. Our data generation pipeline, summarized in Algorithm 1, starts with seed set of query-answer pairs C. In our experiments, we sampled 20K pairs round robin from 186 diﬀerent communities on StackExchange. For each answer, we extract linked documents (hyperlinks) that potentially contain supporting evidence, establishing an initial set of query-document pairs. To increase diversity and to source potential negative documents, we use teacher LLM to generate related queries and retrieve additional documents through web search using the Brave Search API. The teacher model is then instructed to generate an explanation and discrete relevance label for each query-document pair, creating distillation dataset. This approach naturally captures diverse reasoning patterns since the teacher model must explain how different types of evidence support or fail to support answers across technical domains - from code analysis to scientiﬁc explanations. The explanations demonstrate diﬀerent forms of reasoning like logical deduction, causal analysis, and domain-speciﬁc technical reasoning. The next two phases are summarized in Algorithm 2. 2. Knowledge Distillation: We ﬁrst transfer knowledge from large zero-shot teacher model to more compact student model through supervised ﬁne-tuning. We use Llama 3.2 3B [9] as our base student model and as mentioned earlier, Llama 3.3 70B is used as our teacher model. The objective is to maximize the log likelihood of teacher-generated outputs: 𝜃 1 = arg max 𝜃 E(𝑞,𝑑,𝑒,𝑙 )𝐷synth [log 𝑝𝜃 (𝑒, 𝑙 𝑞,𝑑)] (1) where 𝑒 and 𝑙 denote an explanation and discrete relevance label. 𝜃 1 is the trained student model parameters after knowledge distillation. This phase helps the student model learn some initial reasoning patterns. 3. Reinforcement Learning: While distillation helps transfer basic reasoning patterns from the teacher, it is limited to imitating single explanation path per example. In practice, there may be multiple valid ways to reason about document relevance. The reinforcement learning (RL) phase enables exploration of diverse reasoning strategies through sampling, with the reward model providing feedback to identify the most eﬀective explanations. For each query-document pair, we sample 𝑘 = 8 outputs from the model being trained (i.e., starting from the student model from Step 2) and evaluate them using reward model. We observed that the reward values can have very high variance, and they heavily depend on query complexity and domain. For this reason, we use relative reward values after max-min normalization for each set of outputs ˆ𝑦 for given query-document input (𝑞, 𝑑): (𝑞, 𝑑, ˆ𝑦) = (𝑞,𝑑, ˆ𝑦) min(R) max(R) min(R) (2) where min(R) and max(R) are the minimum and maximum reward values for the given query-document input pair.

BRIGHT includes seven datasets from StackExchange communities (Biology, Earth Science, Economics, Psychology, Robotics, Stack Overﬂow, and Sustainable Living), each containing 100-200 expert-validated query-document pairs where relevance is determined by citations in accepted answers. The remaining 5 datasets focus on coding and mathematical reasoning: Pony (syntax documentation pairs), LeetCode (algorithmic problems), TheoremQA (theorem-based questions), AoPS (competition math problems), and Theorem Retrieval (problems paired with ProofWiki statements). In total, BRIGHT contains 1,384 queries with 6.37 positive documents per query on average. The queries are typically Experimental Setup. The base LLM for InteRank is Llama 3.2 3B, while Llama 3.3 70B is our teacher model [9]. We use QLoRA [6] for parameter-eﬃcient ﬁne-tuning, with 4-bit quantization of the base model and trainable rank-64 adapters. Due to resource constraints, we limit the context length to 4K tokens. Training is performed on single A100 GPU with an eﬀective batch size of 16 (batch size 1 with 16 gradient accumulation steps) using the AdamW optimizer with learning rate 2e-4. For the sampling of outputs in the RL stage, we use temperature 1.0 for nucleus sampling, reward threshold 𝜏 = 0.85, and reward scaling power 𝑚 = 3. We perform two epochs of RL training. For the reward model, we use pretrained Llama 3.1 8B model [16] that has demonstrated strong performance on RewardBench [14]. We found that this model has very high agreement with larger open-weight and commercial LLMs in relative comparison of explanation outputs, making it suitable for our training process. Baselines.

Smaller dense retrievers trained on MSMARCO like TAS-B (66M) perform poorly with only 8.53% average nDCG@10, highlighting their limitations beyond simple semantic matching. This is particularly evident in reasoning-intensive domains like theorem-based tasks (1.51% on TheoT) and complex StackExchange queries (2.77% on Biology). In contrast, larger dense retrievers trained on more diverse data with 100M+ training examples, show signiﬁcant improvements; GTE-large (400M) achieves 18.0% and Qwen1.5 (7B) reaches 22.4% average nDCG@10, demonstrating the importance of model scale and training data for complex retrieval tasks. 2.

As shown in Table 1, our ablation studies reveal that removing the explanation component (rows marked w/o expl.) causes accuracy to drop signiﬁcantly from 21.5% to 14.4% nDCG@10 on average. Traditional BERT re-ranking models that rely purely on semantic matching also show surprisingly poor performance, with ModernBERTL achieving only 4.57% average nDCG@10.

Distillation results in small student models with teacher performance. Our results also demonstrate that our approach successfully distills complex reasoning capabilities into compact 3B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to models over 20 times larger (see Llama 3.3 70B in Table 1). When combined with the Qwen1.5 retriever and domain-speciﬁc relevance deﬁnitions in the rankers prompt (rows marked with + instruct in Table 1), InteRank achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average of 27.4% across all domains reaching the third spot in BRIGHT leaderboard, just below JudgeRank [20], an ensemble of 3 zero-shot LLMs (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) and baseline using Llama 70B with query-rewriting with GPT-4. Our 3B parameter model outperforms all other baseline methods on the BRIGHT benchmark, including recent approaches like Reason-to-Rank [12] (nDCG@5 26.2 vs 19.6) which uses an 8B parameter model. 4. RL improves reasoning for ranking. The iterative RL process shows domain-dependent eﬀects, as detailed in Table 2. While the ﬁrst iteration leads to broad improvements (+1.1% nDCG@10 on average), the second iteration reveals an interesting pattern - performance continues to improve in reasoning-intensive domains like mathematics and coding while declining in domains with simpler reasoning requirements. This suggests that additional RL iterations help reﬁne complex reasoning capabilities but may lead to over-ﬁtting in domains where simpler strategies suﬃce. Table 2 presents detailed results examining the impact of diﬀerent training stages. The supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT) stage establishes strong initial performance, particularly in domains like Biology and Earth Science. The ﬁrst RL iteration shows the largest gains in theoretical domains (TheoQ), coding tasks (Pony, Leetcode), and earth science. The second iteration further improves performance speciﬁcally in reasoning-intensive tasks (Leetcode, Pony, TheoQ, TheoT) while showing decline in simpler domains, highlighting the trade-oﬀ between specialized reasoning capabilities and general performance.
