This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teacher. However, distilling knowledge from large teacher to small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teachers complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking teacher and reinforcing student), mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks and non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher from mask to gradually increase the teacher capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations of teacher in smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and distillation reward that quantifies the ease of their responses transferability from teacher to student. Unlike online thinkanswer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling the students to achieve strong performance without requiring the thinkanswer process. Extensive experiments across diverse VLM benchmarks demonstrate that Masters outperforms existing compact VLMs and partially surpasses large ones, while being far more efficient. Moreover, gradually increasing the teacher sizes during distillation (e.g., from 14B to 38B) yields smoother convergence and stronger generalization than one-shot distillation (e.g., 38B), revealing scalable path toward efficient and deployable VLMs. Figure 1 Comparing Masters-applied VLMs with diverse openand closed-source VLMs across broad model sizes for averaged performance (%) of numerous evaluation benchmarks: AI2D [1], ChartQA [2], MathVista [3], MMB [4], MM-Vet [5], MMMU [6], MMMU-Pro [7], MMStar [8], BLINK [9], SEED-Bench [10], SEED-Bench-2-Plus [11], and RealWorldQA. 1.

In addition, we show (c) the effect of RL under naive and mask-progressive distillation. Note that asterisk (*) represents the combined distillation of mid-size and large teacher. that in some domains approach human-level understanding [16]. However, these achievements come at the cost of massive model sizes [17, 18, 19, 12] and heavy computational requirements, making them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices [20]. As the demand for on-device intelligence continues to grow, there is an urgent need for compact yet powerful VLMs [21, 22, 23, 24] that can deliver competitive performance while maintaining high efficiency and deployability [25, 26]. widely adopted approach for building such lightweight yet capable models is knowledge distillation [27, 28], where large teacher transfers its knowledge to smaller student. Despite its promise, distillation remains challenging due to the substantial size gap between teacher and student [29, 30, 31]. The student often struggles to reproduce the teachers rich and high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and significant performance degradation [32, 33, 34]. Recent distillation has explored modified training objectives [35, 36, 37, 38], dynamic intermediatelayer distillation [39, 40], vision-attention distillation [41, 42], multi-step distillation [43, 44], crosstoken general distillation [45, 46], and reinforcement learning (RL)based approaches [47, 48, 49]. However, few works have directly addressed the fundamental issue of the large size gap itself. To tackle this challenge, we first mask nondominant weights of the teacher based on their magnitudes [50], thereby reducing unnecessary complexity. This is because the large number of weights in the teacher is core factor that makes distillation difficult. After masking the weights in the teacher, we perform the knowledge distillation progressively where the teacher is gradually restored from the mask throughout the entire training to increase the teachers representation complexity. This mask-progressive strategy enables the student to first capture coarse-grained patterns and subsequently refine them into more detailed and higher-level representations, thereby learning richer and more complex representations of the teacher in smooth and stable manner. Furthermore, we identify critical limitations in existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets [51, 52, 53], where answer labels are typically generated by large closed-source models with an extremely large number of parameters, such as GPT-4o [14], Gemini [54], or Claude [55], and often filtered by humans [56]. Small student, however, has limited capacity to learn these rich answer labels due to its smaller vocabulary and lower hidden dimension of representation [57, 58]. To address this, we utilize the generated responses from masked teachers instead of directly using standard SFT samples. This enables the 2 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Figure 3 Overview of mask-progressive distillation where teacher is masked with decreasing masking ratio (0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, 0), gradually restoring its full capacity. At each masking stage for teacher, student is updated using two rewards: accuracy reward 𝑅acc and distillation reward 𝑅distill. This progressive distillation enables smooth and stable knowledge transfer to the student. student to learn the responses that better match the students current capacity. Moreover, we incorporate the students own generated responses into training to maintain alignment between the teachers guidance and the students evolving representational capacity. This design ensures stable yet continual improvement toward the teachers behavior, going beyond the single-answer and over-rich label constraints of conventional SFT datasets. However, some generated responses may contain factual errors or exhibit linguistic complexity that hinders effective knowledge transfer, ultimately degrading the distillation performance. Hence, we aim to evaluate both the accuracy of the responses and their ease of knowledge transfer, and further refine the student to avoid such undesirable responses. To achieve this, we integrate RL into the distillation process. Specifically, we compute two types of rewards: an accuracy reward evaluated by LLM-as-a-Judge [59] to account for flexible and diverse answers, and distillation reward that measures how easily knowledge can be transferred from the teacher to the student. In practice, conventional online RL is too slow and inefficient training, since it requires the model to repeatedly generate multiple responses at every training step under the recent thinkanswer paradigm [60, 61]. As result, only very limited amount of data samples [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 49] are utilized, constraining the scale and diversity of training samples. To address these limitations, we adopt an offline RL approach in which both the teacher and the student pre-generate their multiple responses for all questions, without explicit thinkanswer. These pre-generated responses are then used for RL training, significantly reducing training time and computational costs. Bringing these components together, we propose mask-progressive RL distillation framework, referred to as Masking teacher and reinforcing students (Masters). It integrates teacher weight masking, progressive distillation, multi-response learning, and offline RL into unified training paradigm. Through this design, it enables the student to effectively absorb knowledge from large teachers while maintaining high efficiency and stability. Through extensive experiments across diverse evaluation benchmarks, we demonstrate that Masters consistently outperforms existing compact VLMs and exceeds large ones in Fig. 1. Beyond empirical gains, we find that gradually increasing the teacher sizes during distillation (e.g., from 14B to 38B) leads to smoother convergence and superior generalization compared to one-shot distillation from single large teacher (e.g., 38B), revealing an effective pathway for scalable model compression. We believe this framework marks an important step toward efficient, deployable, and continually improvable VLMs for on-device intelligence. Our main contributions can be summarized in threefold as follows: Progressive capacity-aligned dis3 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Figure 4 Depicting multiple responses generated by both the masked teacher and the student, where an accuracy reward (𝑅acc) evaluates the binary correctness of each response, and distillation reward (𝑅distill) measures the ease of knowledge transfer based on divergence objective between teacher and student logits. Note that the rank labels (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) in 𝑅distill indicate the relative magnitude of the divergence values, where the smallest divergence (1st) receives the highest reward (1.0) and the largest divergence the lowest reward (0.0). tillation: We propose progressive teacherstudent alignment strategy that adaptively matches the students learning capacity through restoring the teacher from the mask. Offline RL with dual rewards: By pregenerating diverse responses from both the teacher and the student, our offline RL substantially reduces training time while efficiently achieving strong performance with two complementary objectives an accuracy reward for correctness and distillation reward for transferability. Unified and scalable framework: We integrate progressive capacity-aligned distillation and offline RL into unified training framework with scaled-up data, enabling compact VLMs to attain large model-level performance for practical efficiency and deployability. 2. Related Work Previous approaches to building efficient VLMs (see Appendix A) have focused on inserting additional modules, modifying internal architectures, or altering propagation strategies within the models themselves. Recent emerging line of research on efficient VLMs has begun to leverage knowledge distillation [27, 28], where the knowledge of large, high-capacity teacher is transferred into smaller, more efficient student. This is because training small model alone inherently limits its representational capacity, prompting shift toward utilizing rich logit or intermediate representations from the teacher. Beyond the scope of VLM research, early studies on knowledge distillation primarily focused on aligning the logits between the teacher and student [69, 70]. Subsequent works extended this paradigm to intermediate feature representations [71, 72, 73, 74, 75], and later introduced probabilistic [76], relational [77], and contrastive formulations [78] to better capture internal dependencies [79, 80, 81, 82]. Several studies have explored multi-teacher frameworks [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88] to integrate diverse knowledge sources, while others have leveraged step-by-step reasoning traces from large models to enhance the students reasoning and compositional capabilities [89, 90]. More recent research has investigated alternative training objectives [35, 36, 37, 38], dynamic intermediatelayer distillation [39, 40], vision-attention distillation [41, 42], multi-step distillation [43, 44], cross-token general distillation [45, 46], and reinforcement learning (RL)based approaches [47, 48, 49]. Despite these advances, model distillation re4 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Table 1 Comparing the performance between naive, mask-progressive, and RL-applied distillation on AI2D [1], ChartQA [2], MathVista [3], MMB/MMBCN [4], MM-Vet [5], MMMU [6], MMMU-Pro [7], MMStar [8], BLINK [9], SEED [10], SEED2+ [11], RealWorldQA (RWQA).

The student often struggles to reproduce the teachers rich, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable training and noticeable performance degradation [32, 33, 34]. However, only limited efforts have been made to directly narrow the parameter gap between teacher and student. Unlike existing approaches that primarily focus on modifying distillation objectives, aligning intermediate features, or combining multiple strategies, we aim to directly address the large parameter gap between teacher and student. To this end, we first mask non-dominant weights in the teacher based on their magnitudes [50], effectively reducing the number of active parameters and simplifying the teachers representational space. This masking step not only narrows the capacity gap between teacher and student but also filters out noisy or over-parameterized components that hinder stable knowledge transfer. As training proceeds, we progressively restore the teacher from mask, allowing the student to gradually learn complex representations of teacher in capacity-aligned manner. This leads to smoother optimization and mitigates the instability in direct distillation from large teacher. 3. Masters This section introduces the two pivotal components that form the core of the Masters: how to mask the teacher (Secs. 3.1 and 3.2) and reinforce the student (Sec. 3.3). 3.1. Magnitude-based Teacher Masking key challenge in distilling knowledge from large teacher to small student lies in the significant parameter gap between them. To reduce this gap, we adopt magnitude-based masking strategy inspired by classical network pruning [50], where weights with smaller magnitudes are masked to zero. Given teacher 𝒯 with 𝑛=1 (𝑤𝑛 R), we construct weight W𝒯 = {𝑤𝑛}𝑁 binary mask M𝑟 = {𝑚𝑛}𝑁 𝑛=1 (𝑚𝑛 0, 1) as follows: 𝑚𝑛 = {1, 0, if 𝑤𝑛 𝜆𝑟, otherwise, (1) where 𝑁 denotes the total number of parameters (e.g., 𝑁 = 38B when using InternVL3.5-38B [12]), and 𝜆𝑟 is magnitude threshold determined by the desired masking ratio 𝑟 [0, 1]. For example, when 𝑟 = 0, it is the original teacher. Conversely, when 𝑟 = 1, all weights are masked to zero. With 𝑟 = 0.2, the magnitude threshold 𝜆0.2 is determined by sorting the magnitude of W𝒯 in ascending order, such that approximately 5 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Table 2 Comparison of the performance among naive (using large and mid teacher), mask-progressive, and RL-applied distillation.

The resulting masked teacher parameters are defined as: W𝒯𝑟 = M𝑟 W𝒯 , (2) where denotes element-wise multiplication, and 𝒯𝑟 represents the masked teacher under masking ratio 𝑟. This masking process effectively removes low-magnitude weights that contribute marginally to prediction logits [50], yielding simplified yet representative teacher. By reducing parameter of the teacher, the student 𝒮 learns more capacity-aligned representation, mitigating optimization instability. Notably, unlike conventional pruning approaches [91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98] designed for model compression, our masking is temporary and restored later. In practice, we found that using global threshold 𝜆𝑟 across all layers often excessively prunes certain layers, which can make the model non-functional at inference time. To prevent this imbalance, we compute 𝜆𝑟 per layer and apply masking separately to each layer so that the overall masking remains balanced and consistent across the teacher network. 3.2. Mask-Progressive Distillation Scheduling Masking Ratio. While the masked teacher provides simplified representation, learning solely with fixed masking ratio Figure 5 Comparing the performances by the number of generated responses from teacher and student. limits the students exposure to the teachers rich representation. To solve it, we adopt maskprogressive strategy that gradually restores the teachers full capacity over the entire training.

For example, setting 𝑟max = 0.2 and 𝑠 = 0.05 results in 𝑀 = 5, meaning that the masking ratio progressively decreases as 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, and finally 0. Fig. 2(a) illustrates how the masking ratio 𝑟[𝑖] is scheduled during training. As the masking ratio changes, the distillation objective also adapt to reflect the teachers gradually increasing capacity. Formally, the distillation objective at iteration 𝑖 is formulated as: [ )] ( 𝒟 𝑃𝒯𝑟[𝑖](𝑦𝑥) 𝑃𝒮(𝑦𝑥) , E(𝑥,𝑦)Data[𝑖] min W𝒮 (4) where W𝒮 indicates the weight set of the student 𝒮, and 𝑃 (𝑦𝑥) denotes the logit-softmax output for answer label 𝑦 given question 𝑥 under the data subset Data[𝑖] at the iteration 𝑖. Note that 𝒟 refers to Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) [36, 38], which has been empirically shown to outperform the standard KL divergence for distillation tasks. This mask-progressive distillation allows the student to first learn coarse-grained knowledge and progressively refine its representations as the teachers representational capacity is restored throughout training. Multiple Responses. While mask-progressive distillation enables the student to learn from capacity-aligned teacher, the training data samples used for distillation still exhibit two inherent limitations. First, conventional SFT datasets are typically generated by large closed-source models [14, 54] or filtered by humans [56]. Injecting such responses into small student often leads to performance degradation due to representation mismatchsmall vocabulary and low hidden dimension of representation. Second, standard SFT datasets generally provide only single answer per question, which severely limits response diversity and generalization. This single-answer guidance forces the student to overfit to narrow linguistic or reasoning style, reducing its versatility across broader visionlanguage contexts. To address these limitations, Masters gener7 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Table 4 Comparing Masters-applied Small VLMs with Closed-source and Large Open-source VLMs. VLMs AI2D ChartQA MathVista MMB MM-Vet MMMU MMMU-Pro MMStar BLINK SEED SEED2+ RWQA Claude-3.5-Sonnet [55] Claude-3.7-Sonnet [55] Claude-4-Sonnet [55] Gemini-1.5-Pro [109] Gemini-2.0-Flash [109] Gemini-2.5-Pro [54] GLM-4.5V [102] GPT-4o [110] GPT-4.1 [110] GPT-5-Mini [110] GPT-5 [110] NVLM-72B [111] LLaVA-OneVision-72B [99] Molmo-72B [112] Qwen2.5-VL-72B [17] Qwen3-VL-32B [18] InternVL3-78B [19] InternVL3.5-38B [12] Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Masters Qwen3-VL-8B-Masters InternVL3-8B-Masters InternVL3.5-8B-Masters 81.2 82.5 83.0 79.1 83.1 89.5 88.1 84.6 85.9 88.2 89.5 85.2 85.6 83.4 88.7 89.5 89.7 87. 88.6 88.5 88.9 87.2 90.8 92.2 - 87.2 - - 86.6 85.7 - - - 86.0 83.7 87.3 89.5 89.8 89.7 88.8 95.6 95.9 94.8 95.1 67.7 66.8 74.6 63.9 70.4 80.9 84.6 63.8 70.4 79.1 81.9 66.6 67.5 58.6 74.2 83.8 79.0 81. 78.8 81.8 82.3 85.0 82.6 84.8 - 73.9 90.0 - - 83.4 - - - - 85.8 - 88.6 90.6 89.0 90.3 89.1 89.5 90.1 88.2 70.1 70.0 - 64.0 73.6 83.3 75.2 69.1 78.8 - 77.6 58.9 60.6 61.1 76.9 79.4 81.3 82. 81.7 79.4 83.8 85.6 68.3 71.0 74.4 62.2 69.9 74.7 75.4 69.1 74.0 79.0 84.2 59.7 56.8 54.1 68.2 76.0 72.2 76.9 71.3 72.9 74.0 72.7 51.5 56.5 61.6 46.9 54.4 - 65.2 51.9 - 67.3 - - 31.0 - 61.2 65.3 62.3 66. 60.6 61.4 58.8 58.1 65.1 65.1 69.4 59.1 69.4 73.6 75.3 64.7 69.8 74.1 75.7 63.7 65.8 63.3 70.8 77.7 72.5 75.3 74.9 79.7 82.0 80.8 60.1 56.6 60.4 59.1 64.0 - 65.3 68.0 68.5 - - 48.0 55.4 49.7 64.4 67.3 66.3 60. 67.2 72.3 68.0 67.8 61.7 74.3 - 76.0 - - - 77.1 78.0 - - 75.5 77.5 74.6 79.5 79.9 78.7 79.1 81.8 81.7 82.6 81.4 71.7 67.6 - 70.8 - - 74.0 72.0 73.1 - - 68.4 - 67.6 73.0 72.8 71.9 71. 75.9 75.1 75.0 75.5 65.8 55.4 69.8 67.5 72.3 - 75.4 78.7 79.0 - 69.9 71.9 73.7 75.7 79.0 78.0 75.9 77.3 77.5 74.8 74.9 ates multiple responses from the masked teacher, where the teachers representational capacity increases as the masking ratio decreases. These responses provide the student with adaptive guidance signals that evolve in step with their learning capacity. Furthermore, Masters incorporates the students own responses into training to maintain alignment between teacher guidance and the students evolving representational capacity. The formulation regarding multiple responses is written as follows: E(𝑥,^𝑦)Gen-Data[𝑖] 𝑃𝒯𝑟[𝑖](^𝑦𝑥) 𝑃𝒮(^𝑦𝑥) [ 𝒟 )] ( , min W𝒮 (5) where Gen-Data[𝑖] denotes the pre-generated multi-response dataset obtained from both the masked teacher and the student at training iteration 𝑖. This enables stable yet continual improvement toward teacher-level behavioreffectively overcoming the single-answer and over-rich label constraints of conventional SFT datasets. curacy and the transferability of the responses and refine the student based on their feedback to avoid generating such undesirable responses. Offline RL Setup. Conventional online RL paradigms, such as the think-answer process [60, 61], require generating multiple and long responses at each training iteration, incurring substantial computational overhead. To overcome this limitation, Masters adopts an offline RL setup where both the teacher and the student pre-generate multiple responses for all questions in the training dataset. This design dramatically reduces computational cost while enabling scaled-up training with diverse responses. Accuracy Reward. To assess the correctness of generated responses, we adopt an LLM-asa-Judge [59], which measures semantic fidelity between the generated responses ^𝑦 and the answer labels 𝑦. The accuracy reward is defined as: 3.3. Reinforcing Student with Dual Reℛacc = LLM-as-a-Judge(𝑥, ^𝑦, 𝑦) [0, 1]. (6) wards Although generating multiple responses helps mitigate the constraints of conventional SFT datasets, some generated responses may include factual inaccuracies or overly complex language that hampers effective knowledge transfer, thereby reducing distillation performance. To address this, we evaluate both the factual acThis reward guides the student to generate semantically accurate and faithful outputs, regardless of linguistic or stylistic variations. Unlike prior approaches such as DeepSeek-R1 [60] and its follow-up variants [64, 67, 66, 68], which depend on traditional parsers for limited domain evaluation metrics (e.g., math reasoning or spatial grounding), LLM-as-a-Judge method elimi8 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models nates such constraints. For example, traditional parsers fail when handling open-ended visual questions like Describe the persons emotion in this image. Even, when comparing about five minutes (predicted) with 5 (answer label), traditional parsing says that the predicted response is wrong answer. On the other hands, LLM-asa-Judge [59] delivers consistent and robust judgments across diverse visual question answering (VQA) scenarios including recognition, OCR, reasoning, chart and document understanding providing more generalizable and semantically grounded measure of correctness. Distillation Reward. While the accuracy reward ensures response correctness, it does not capture how effectively the student learns responses. To address this, we introduce distillation reward that measures logit-level similarity between the teacher and student. Specifically, we compute this reward using 𝒟 defined in Eq. (4). Practically, we have observed that the values of 𝒟 exhibit small variance across the generated responses due to its low scaling. To stabilize optimization and enhance sensitivity [113], we apply reverse min-max normalization [114] as follows: ℛdistill = 𝒟max 𝒟 𝒟max 𝒟min , (7) where 𝒟min and 𝒟max denote the minimum and maximum divergence among the generated responses ^𝑦 for given question 𝑥. This normalization ensures that smaller divergence (indicating better alignment with the teacher) yields higher reward value. The total reward is then computed as the sum of the accuracy and distillation rewards. Final Objective. We adopt RL objective of GRPO [61] (see Appendix B) and extend it with Eq. (5), as follows: 4. Experiments 4.1. Implementation Details Model Selection. We select recently released, high-performing student and teacher VLMs based on Leaderboard [115]. For student, we employ several strong series, including Qwen2.5-VL-3B and -7B [17], Qwen3-VL2B, -4B, and -8B, InternVL3-2B, and -8B [19], as well as InternVL3.5-2B, -4B, and -8B [12]. For teacher, we select corresponding family of Qwen2.5-VL-32B and -72B [17], Qwen3-VL32B [18], InternVL3-14B, -38B, and -78B [19], and InternVL3.5-14B and -38B [12]. Training Setup. We train and evaluate Masters primarily on NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs. We first set the decrement 𝑠 to 0.05 and save multiple masked teacher checkpoints with different masking ratios. For instance, when 𝑟max is set to 0.2, we store five masked teacher checkpoints corresponding to masking ratios of 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, and 0. We then make all five masked teachers generate responses for the 1.5M dataset (see Appendix C), by using vLLM [116] for fast inference. Specifically, we generate 8 responses per question by setting the temperature to 1.0, top-p to 0.9, top-k to 50, and the repetition penalty to 1.05. We simultaneously evaluate the accuracy reward of the responses via LLM-as-a-Judge [59]. The model used for judging is the same as the one selected for generation, and we further refine the accuracy reward through additional parsing prompts (see Appendix D). For RL, we utilize the DeepSpeed engine with ZeRO-3 [117] to efficiently handle large teacher and student. The student is optimized using AdamW [118] with fixed learning rate of 1 106.

Next, we apply teacher masking and perform maskprogressive distillation based on Eq. (5), which yields clear improvementsconfirming that capacity alignment between the teacher and the student stabilizes optimization. Finally, adding RL allows the student to further refine the responses through feedback (correctness and transferability). Overall, combining mask-progressive distillation with RL feedback results in cumulative performance boost, demonstrating that each component contributes synergistically to the overall effectiveness of Masters. We further analyze the impact of gradually increasing the teacher sizes during distillation (e.g., from 14B to 38B), as shown in Tab. 2. We first distill knowledge from an intermediate-sized (mid) teacher as warm-up stage, and then perform distillation from larger teacher. This gradual teacher-size scaling (Blue Color) consistently yields better performance than one-shot distillation from large teacher (Green Color), indicating that progressive capacity alignment leads to smoother convergence and richer representations. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the masking ratio schedule and performance trends across different teacher settings. Notably, after the warm-up stage with the mid teacher shown in Fig. 2(b), performance accelerates significantly when distilling from the large teacher, highlighting the advantage of this teacher scaling strategy. In summary, when combined with mask-progressive distillation and RL feedback, Masters elevates the Figure 6 Comparing hours of inference time at one GPU across various models described in Tab. 3 student to highly competitive levelmatching or even surpassing many recent openand closedsource VLMs, as reported in Tab. 3 and Tab. 4 across various model scales  (Fig. 1)  . 4.3. Ablation Studies with Configurations We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to examine various configuration settings that influence the detailed performance of Masters. First, we investigate the number of pre-generated responses in Fig. 5. As this number increases, performance steadily improves and converges around eight responses. Therefore, we set the number of generated responses to eight to achieve great balance between training efficiency and performance. Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Next, Tab. 5(a) shows grid search to determine the optimal maximum masking ratio (𝑟max) for each teacher, ranging from 0 to 0.5. For most teachers, the optimal value is 𝑟max = 0.2, whereas Qwen3-VL-32B [18] achieves its best results with 𝑟max = 0.4. Beyond this table, we similarly observe that InternVL3.5-8B and -14B [12] also perform best at 𝑟max = 0.4. We then analyze the effect of teacher composition when distilling InternVL3 series [19] from large teachers to an 8B student. Consistent with the results in Tab. 2, the best performance is achieved with gradual teacher-size scaling of 14B, 38B, and 78B in Tab. 5(b). This confirms that progressive teacher scaling enables more stable and capacityaligned knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we examine how the source of generated responses affects performance. As shown in Tab. 5(c), using only teacher-generated responses limits the students adaptability to its own representational capacity, while using only student-generated responses restricts exposure to the teachers richer semantics. Consequently, we adopt balanced 1:1 ratio of teacherand studentgenerated responses to ensure both adaptability and semantic richness. Tab. 5(d) compares various configurations, including naive versus maskprogressive distillation, with and without midteacher scaling, multi-response generation, and reward feedback (Fig. 2(c)). The results demonstrate that each component contributes synergistically to performance, and removing any of them leads to degradationhighlighting their essential roles in performance acceleration. Next, we analyze the impact of reward design by selectively removing the accuracy or distillation reward. The triangle symbol () for the accuracy reward indicates the rule-based evaluation, which does not rely on LLM-as-a-Judge [59], while the triangle for the distillation reward denotes exclusion of reverse minmax normalization. Removing the accuracy reward consistently results in performance below that of the large teacher, underscoring its importance in enabling the student to surpass the teacher. Without normalization, the distillation reward becomes less discriminative, yielding performance comparable to using only the accuracy reward. As shown in Tab. 5(e), both accuracy and distillation rewards are essential for effectively identifying high-quality responses. Finally, we apply Masters to other recent distillation frameworks: DistiLLM [37], LLaVAKD [44], VLsI [39], and RIL [49]. Masters consistently mitigates degradation caused by large parameter gaps. Notably, while most existing methods rely on multi-step pipelines with additional SFT phases to maintain stability, Masters achieves superior results in single-step training processdemonstrating its simplicity, scalability, and training efficiency. 5. Discussion and Conclusion Although Masters shows strong performance and scalability, it is trained in an offline manner, which limits adaptability to real-time feedback. In principle, training could continuously improve the model via online data sampling, but it remains computationally infeasiblefor instance, even single model requires over 30 days on 256 A100 GPUs for 1.5M samples, whereas Masters completes training in just two days. Future advances in efficient multi-node training and inference from vLLM-like libraries is strongly needed for online distillation within days. Beyond this limitation, recent methods often adopt think-answer paradigm, which improves reasoning but greatly increases latency  (Fig. 6)  . Such approaches remain impractical for real-world or on-device use due to their heavy computational cost. In contrast, Masters attains strong performance without sacrificing inference speed, suggesting promising direction for balancing intelligence and scalability toward efficient VLMs. We present Masters, progressively restoring the teacher from mask and reinforcing the student with dual rewards in an offline setting. It achieves stable and scalable knowledge transfer from large to compact models. Future work may explore data-driven masking and RL-based replay buffers to better handle hard examples. We hope Masters will inspire further research toward deployable and efficient VLMs. 11 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models"

Infinity-mm: Scaling multimodal performance with large-scale and high-quality instruction data. arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.18558, 2024. 22 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models A. Related Work of Efficient VLMs With the advent of visual instruction tuning [15, 119] and the scaling of large language models (LLMs) [120, 121, 122], both large-scale open-source [17, 18, 19, 12] and closed-source [14, 54, 55] visionlanguage models (VLMs) have emerged. However, these large-scale VLMs impose substantial computational demands in real-world scenarios [123, 124], such as on-device or edge processing. Consequently, there is growing demand for lightweight VLMs that can be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained devices while maintaining fast inference, driving active research in efficient VLM design. Early efforts have mainly focused on integrating additional visual encoders [125, 126, 127, 128], multiple computer vision backbones [129, 130, 131, 132], or rational embeddings [133, 134, 135] into LLMs [136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141]. In addition, growing body of research [142, 143, 144, 145, 146] has explored architectural strategiessuch as shared or repetitive feed-forward network (FFN) structures and expanded hidden dimensionsto enhance efficiency without significant performance degradation. Furthermore, several studies [147, 148, 21, 149, 150, 151] propose visiontext aligned training strategies, adopt Mamba architecture [152], or incorporate the mixture-of-experts paradigm [153, 154, 155, 156, 157] to achieve scalable model capacity. B. The Objective of GRPO For question 𝑥 and its multiple generated responses {^𝑦𝑗}𝐺 (Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization) is defined as: 𝑗=1, the RL objective of GRPO [61] ℒGRPO = E𝑗 [E𝑡 [min (𝑟𝑗,𝑡𝐴𝑗, clip(𝑟𝑗,𝑡, 1 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀)𝐴𝑗 ) 𝛽𝐷KL(𝜋𝜃𝜋ref )]] , where 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 = 𝜋𝜃(^𝑦𝑗,𝑡 𝑥, ^𝑦𝑗,<𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old(^𝑦𝑗,𝑡 𝑥, ^𝑦𝑗,<𝑡) and 𝐴𝑗 = ℛ𝑗 mean ( {ℛ𝑗}𝐺 𝑗=1 ) ) . ( std {ℛ𝑗}𝐺 𝑗= (9) (10) Here, 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 denotes the policy ratio for new policy 𝜋𝜃 and old policy 𝜋𝜃old for each token 𝑡, and 𝐴𝑗 indicates the advantage computed by normalized rewards ℛ. This objective encourages the new policy 𝜋𝜃 to improve upon the old policy 𝜋𝜃old according the advantage 𝐴. The clipped surrogate objective limits the policy update ratio 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 to the range [1 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀], preventing excessively large updates. In addition, KL divergence term 𝐷KL(𝜋𝜃𝜋ref ) penalizes deviation from reference policy 𝜋ref , ensuring regularization for stable training. In our Masters training setup, the total reward is computed as the sum ℛ = ℛacc + ℛdistill, from which the advantage is directly derived. Since the updating model is the student, the policy 𝜋𝜃 corresponds to the students logit-softmax output 𝑃𝒮, and the parameter 𝜃 represents the students weight set W𝒮. In our setup, the policy ratio 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 is always one because the student is updated only once per training iteration 𝑖; hence, the old policy 𝜋𝜃old and the new policy 𝜋𝜃 are identical. Therefore, the clipped surrogate term becomes redundant, and the objective of GRPO simplifies to ℒGRPO = E𝑗 [𝑟𝑗,𝑡𝐴𝑗 𝛽𝐷KL(𝜋𝜃𝜋ref )] , (11) where 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 = 1. Technically, we still keep the ratio term in the expression to ensure the gradient properly flows to the student parameters during training. Additionally, we set 𝛽 = 0.1 to prevent the student from being updated excessively, providing stable regularization. 1 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models C.
