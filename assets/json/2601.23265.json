Introduction Autonomous scientific discovery is long-standing pursuit of artificial general intelligence (Ghahramani, 2015; Langley, 1987, 2024; Schmidhuber, 2010). With the rapid evolution of Large Language Corresponding author(s): dwzhu@pku.edu.cn, lisujian@pku.edu.cn, jinsungyoon@google.com * This work was done while Dawei was student researcher at Google Cloud AI Research. PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Models (LLMs) (Anthropic, 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025b; Yang et al., 2025a), autonomous AI Scientists have demonstrated the potential to automate many facets of the research lifecycle, such as literature review, idea generation, and experiment iteration (Gottweis et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025). Yet scientific discoveries achieve their full value only through effective communication. Despite their proficiency in textual analysis and code execution, current autonomous AI scientists struggle to visually communicate discoveries, especially for generating illustrations (diagrams and plots) that adhere to the rigorous standards of academic manuscripts. Among these illustration tasks, generating methodology diagrams represents significant challenge, demanding both content fidelity and visual aesthetics. Prior endeavors for diagram generation have predominantly adopted the code-based paradigm, leveraging TikZ (Belouadi and Eger, 2024; Belouadi et al., 2025), Python-PPTX (Zheng et al., 2025), or SVG to programmatically synthesize diagrams. While effective for structured content, these methods can encounter expressiveness limitations when attempting to produce the intricate visual elements such as specialized icons and custom shapes that are increasingly common in modern AI publications. Conversely, although recent image generation models (Deepmind, 2025; OpenAI, 2025a; Team et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a) have demonstrated advanced instruction-following capabilities and high-quality visual outputs, consistently generating academic illustrations that meet scholarly standards remains difficult task (Zuo et al., 2025). Specialized expertise required for professional illustration tools often constrains researchers ability to freely express complex ideas, forcing them to invest substantial manual effort into crafting figures. This creates significant bottleneck in the effective visual communication of scientific discoveries. In this paper, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework designed to bridge this gap by automating the production of high-quality academic illustrations. Given methodology description and diagram caption as input, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-ofthe-art VLMs and image generation models (e.g. Gemini-3-Pro and Nano-Banana-Pro) to retrieve reference examples, devise detailed plans for content and style, render images, and iteratively refine via self-critique. This reference-driven collaborative workflow allows the system to effectively master the logical composition and stylistic norms required for publication-ready illustrations. Beyond methodology diagrams, our framework demonstrates significant versatility by extending to statistical plots, offering comprehensive solution for scientific visualization. To rigorously evaluate our framework and address the absence of dedicated benchmarks for automated academic illustration, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprehensive benchmark for methodology diagram generation. The benchmark comprises 292 test cases and 292 reference cases curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, spanning diverse research topics and illustration styles. To assess generation quality, we employ VLM-as-a-Judge approach for reference-based scoring against human illustrations across four dimensions: faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics, with reliability verified through correlation with human judgments. Comprehensive experiments on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperBanana. Our method consistently outperforms leading baselines across all four evaluation dimensions faithfulness (+2.8%), conciseness (+37.2%), readability (+12.9%), and aesthetics (+6.6%)as well as the aggregated overall score (+17.0%) for diagram generation. We further show that our method also seamlessly extends to statistical plots. Collectively, our method paves the way for automating the generation of academic illustrations (Examples shown in Figure 1). As demonstration of its capability, figures marked with in this manuscript were entirely generated using PaperBanana. Additionally, we discuss intriguing settings including using our framework to enhance existing humancreated illustrations and using image generation models for statistical plot generation. To sum up, our contributions are: PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists We propose PaperBanana, fully automated agentic framework that orchestrates specialized agents to generate publication-ready academic illustrations. We construct PaperBananaBench to assess the quality of academic illustrations, particularly methodology diagrams. Comprehensive experiments show that our workflow significantly outperforms leading baselines, showing promise for automating the generation of academic illustrations. 2. Task Formulation We formalize the task of automated academic illustration generation as learning mapping from source context and communicative intent to visual representation. Let 𝑆 denote the source context containing the essential information, and 𝐶 denote the communicative intent that specifies the scope and focus of the desired illustration. The goal is to generate an image 𝐼 that faithfully visualizes 𝑆 while fulfilling the communicative intent 𝐶, formulated as: 𝐼 = 𝑓 (𝑆, 𝐶). (1) To further guide the mapping function, the input can be optionally augmented by set of 𝑁 reference examples = {𝐸𝑛}𝑁 𝑛=1. Each example 𝐸𝑛 serves as ground-truth demonstration, defined as tuple 𝐸𝑛 = (𝑆𝑛, 𝐶𝑛, 𝐼𝑛), where 𝐼𝑛 is the reference illustration corresponding to the context 𝑆𝑛 and communicative intent 𝐶𝑛. Integrating this, the unified task formulation becomes: 𝐼 = 𝑓 (𝑆, 𝐶, E), (2) where defaults to when no examples are used (i.e., zero-shot generation). Among various types of academic illustrations, this paper primarily focuses on the automated generation of methodology diagrams, which requires interpreting complex technical concepts and logical flows from textual descriptions into high-fidelity, visually pleasing illustrations. In this setting, the source context 𝑆 is the textual description of the method (e.g., methodology sections), and the communicative intent 𝐶 is the figure caption specifying the scope and focus (e.g., Overview of our framework). 3. Methodology In this section, we present the architecture of PaperBanana, reference-driven agentic framework for automated academic illustration. As illustrated in Figure 2, PaperBanana orchestrates collaborative team of five specialized agentsRetriever, Planner, Stylist, Visualizer, and Criticto transform raw scientific content into publication-quality diagrams and plots. (See Appendix for prompts) Retriever Agent. Given the source context 𝑆 and the communicative intent 𝐶, the Retriever Agent identifies 𝑁 most relevant examples = {𝐸𝑛}𝑁 from the fixed reference set to guide the downstream agents. As defined in Section 2, each example 𝐸𝑖 is triplet (𝑆𝑖, 𝐶𝑖, 𝐼𝑖). To leverage the reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt generative retrieval approach where the VLM performs selection over candidate metadata: 𝑛=1 = VLMRet (cid:0)𝑆, 𝐶, {(𝑆𝑖, 𝐶𝑖)}𝐸𝑖 (cid:1) (3) Specifically, the VLM is instructed to rank candidates by matching both research domain (e.g., Agent & Reasoning) and diagram type (e.g., pipeline, architecture), with visual structure being prioritized over topic similarity. By explicitly reasoned selection of reference illustrations 𝐼𝑖 whose corresponding 3 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Figure 2 [Generated by , textual description to reproduce this diagram is presented in Appendix E.] Overview of our PaperBanana framework. Given the source context and communicative intent, we first apply Linear Planning Phase to retrieve relevant reference examples and synthesize stylistically optimized description. We then use an Iterative Refinement Loop (consisting of Visualizer and Critic Agents) to transform the description into visual output and conduct multi-round refinements to produce the final academic illustration. contexts (𝑆𝑖, 𝐶𝑖) best match the current requirements, the Retriever provides concrete foundation for both structural logic and visual style. Planner Agent. The Planner Agent serves as the cognitive core of the system. It takes the source context 𝑆, communicative intent 𝐶, and retrieved examples as inputs. By performing in-context learning from the demonstrations in E, the Planner translates the unstructured or structured data in 𝑆 into comprehensive and detailed textual description 𝑃 of the target illustration: 𝑃 = VLMplan(𝑆, 𝐶, {(𝑆𝑖, 𝐶𝑖, 𝐼𝑖)}𝐸𝑖 E). (4) Stylist Agent. To ensure the output adheres to the aesthetic standards of modern academic manuscripts, the Stylist Agent acts as design consultant. primary challenge lies in defining comprehensive academic style, as manual definitions are often incomplete. To address this, the Stylist traverses the entire reference collection to automatically synthesize an Aesthetic Guideline covering key dimensions such as color palette, shapes and containers, lines and arrows, layout and composition, and typography and icons (see Appendix for the summarized guideline and implementation details). Armed with this guideline, the Stylist refines each initial description 𝑃 into stylistically optimized version 𝑃: 𝑃 = VLMstyle(𝑃, G). (5) This ensures that the final illustration is not only accurate but also visually professional. Visualizer Agent. After receiving the stylistically optimized description 𝑃, the Visualizer Agent collaborates with the Critic Agent to render academic illustrations and iteratively refine their quality. The Visualizer Agent leverages an image generation model to transform textual descriptions into visual output. In each iteration 𝑡, given description 𝑃𝑡, the Visualizer generates: where the initial description 𝑃0 is set to 𝑃. 𝐼𝑡 = Image-Gen(𝑃𝑡), (6) 4 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Critic Agent. The Critic Agent forms closed-loop refinement mechanism with the Visualizer by closely examining the generated image 𝐼𝑡 and providing refined description 𝑃𝑡+1 to the Visualizer. Upon receiving the generated image 𝐼𝑡 at iteration 𝑡, the Critic inspects it against the original source context (𝑆, 𝐶) to identify factual misalignments, visual glitches, or areas for improvement. It then provides targeted feedback and produces refined description 𝑃𝑡+1 that addresses the identified issues: 𝑃𝑡+1 = VLMcritic(𝐼𝑡, 𝑆, 𝐶, 𝑃𝑡). (7) This revised description is then fed back to the Visualizer for regeneration. The Visualizer-Critic loop iterates for 𝑇 = 3 rounds, with the final output being 𝐼 = 𝐼𝑇 . This iterative refinement process ensures that the final illustration meets the high standards required for academic dissemination. Extension to Statistical Plots. The framework extends to statistical plots by adjusting the Visualizer and Critic agents. For numerical precision, the Visualizer converts the description 𝑃𝑡 into executable Python Matplotlib code: 𝐼𝑡 = VLMcode(𝑃𝑡). The Critic evaluates the rendered plot and generates refined description 𝑃𝑡+1 addressing inaccuracies or imperfections: 𝑃𝑡+1 = VLMcritic(𝐼𝑡, 𝑆, 𝐶, 𝑃𝑡). The same 𝑇 = 3 round iterative refinement process applies. While we prioritize this code-based approach for accuracy, we also explore direct image generation in Section 6. See Appendix G.2 for adjusted prompts. 4. Benchmark Construction The lack of benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation of automated diagram generation. We address this with PaperBananaBench, dedicated benchmark curated from NeurIPS 2025 methodology diagrams, capturing the sophisticated aesthetics and diverse logical compositions of modern AI papers. We detail the construction pipeline and evaluation protocol below; dataset statistics are in Figure 3. 4.1. Data Curation Collection & Parsing. We begin by randomly sampling 2,000 papers from the 5,275 publications at NeurIPS 2025 and retrieving their PDF files. Subsequently, we utilize the MinerU toolkit (Niu et al., 2025) to parse these documents, extracting the text of the methodology sections, and all the diagrams and their captions in the paper. Filtering. We then apply filtering stage to ensure data quality. First, we discard papers without methodology diagrams, yielding 1,359 valid candidates. Second, we restrict the aspect ratio (𝑤 : ℎ) to [1.5, 2.5]. Ratios below 1.5 are excluded as methodology diagrams typically require wider landscape layouts for logical flows, while ratios exceeding 2.5 are unsupported by current image generation models. Including such outliers would introduce bias in side-byside evaluations by revealing the human origin of candidates. This yields 610 valid candidates, each tuple (𝑆, 𝐼, 𝐶), where 𝑆 is the methodology description, 𝐼 is the methodology diagram, and 𝐶 is the caption. Figure 3 [Generated by ] Statistics of the test set of PaperBananaBench (totaling 292 samples). The average length of source context / figure caption is 3,020.1 / 70.4 words. Categorization. To facilitate future analysis of generating different types of diagrams, we further 5 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists categorize the diagrams into four classes, based on visual topology and content: Agent & Reasoning, Vision & Perception, Generative & Learning, and Science & Applications (see Appendix for definitions). Gemini-3-Pro is used to perform the categorization, assigning samples with hybrid elements to their predominant category. Human Curation. Finally, we conduct human curation phase to guarantee the integrity and quality of the dataset. Annotators are tasked with verifying and correcting the extracted methodology descriptions and captions, validating the correctness of diagram categorizations, and filtering out diagrams of insufficient visual quality (e.g., overly simplistic, cluttered, or abstract designs). Following this rigorous process, 584 valid samples remain. We randomly partition these into two equal subsets: test set (𝑁 = 292) for evaluation and reference set (𝑁 = 292) to facilitate retrieval-augmented in-context learning. 4.2. Evaluation Protocol We utilize VLM-as-a-Judge to assess the quality of methodology diagrams and statistical plots. Given the inherent subjectivity in evaluating visual design, we employ referenced comparison approach where the judge compares the model-generated diagram against the human-drawn diagram to determine which better satisfies each evaluation criterion. Evaluation Dimensions. Inspired by Quispel et al. (2018), we evaluate diagrams on two perspectives. Detailed rubrics for each dimension are provided in Appendix H. Content (Faithfulness & Conciseness): Faithfulness ensures alignment with the source context (methodology description) and communicative intent (caption), while Conciseness requires focusing on core information without visual clutter. Presentation (Readability & Aesthetics): Readability demands intelligible layouts, legible text, no excessive crossing lines, etc. Aesthetics evaluates adherence to the stylistic norms of academic manuscripts. Referenced Scoring. For each dimension, the VLM judge compares the model-generated diagram against the human reference given the context and caption. It determines Model wins, Human wins, or Tie based on relative quality, which are then mapped to scores of 100, 0, and 50, respectively. To aggregate scores into an overall metric, we follow the design principle that information visualization must primarily show the truth (Mackinlay, 1986; Quispel et al., 2018; Tufte and Graves-Morris, 1983). We employ hierarchical aggregation strategy, designating faithfulness and readability as primary dimensions, and conciseness and aesthetics as secondary. If primary dimensions yield decisive winner (i.e., winning both, or winning one with tie), this determines the overall winner. In case of tie (e.g., each wins one, or both tie), we apply the same rule to the secondary dimensions. This hierarchical approach ensures that content fidelity and clarity take precedence over aesthetics and conciseness. 5. Experiments 5.1. Baseline Methods and Models We compare PaperBanana against three baseline settings: (1) Vanilla, directly prompting the image generation model to generate diagrams based on the input context (methodology description and caption); (2) Few-shot, building upon the vanilla baseline by augmenting the prompt with 10 few-shot examples, where each example consists of triplet (methodology description, caption, diagram) to enable in-context learning for the image generation model; (3) Paper2Any (Liu et al., 2025), an agentic 6 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Table 1 Main results on PaperBananaBench.

For VLM backbone, we default to Gemini-3-Pro, while for image generation model, we experiment with Nano-Banana-Pro and GPT-Image-1.5. (See Appendix for more implementation details.) 5.2. Evaluation Settings. Evaluating the quality of generated diagrams demands strong visual perception and understanding capabilities, particularly for the Faithfulness dimension, which requires accurately identifying and interpreting subtle modules and connections. Hence, we employ Gemini-3-Pro as our VLM-based Judge. To validate its reliability, we randomly sampled 50 cases (25 from vanilla and 25 from our method) and conducted two-fold validation process: Inter-Model Agreement (Consistency). First, we verify that our evaluation protocol is robust and model-agnostic. We evaluated the agreement between our judge (Gemini-3-Pro) and other distinct VLMs (Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5). Kendalls tau correlations with Gemini-3-Flash across the four dimensions (Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, Aesthetic) and their aggregation are 0.51, 0.60, 0.45, 0.56, and 0.55, respectively; correlations with GPT-5 are 0.43, 0.47, 0.44, 0.42, and 0.45, respectively. This confirms the consistency of our protocol across different judge models1. Human Alignment (Validity). Second, we verify that our VLM judge is valid proxy for human evaluation. We tasked two human annotators to independently perform reference-based scoring on the same 50 samples using the same rubrics, followed by discussion to reach consensus on conflicting cases. Kendalls tau correlations between Gemini-3-Pro and human annotations are 0.43, 0.57, 0.45, 0.41, and 0.45, respectively. These strong correlations demonstrate that our VLM-based judge aligns well with human perception. (See Appendix for more details.) 5.3. Main Results Table 1 summarizes the performance of ours and baseline methods on PaperBananaBench. PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines across all metrics. We attribute the poor performance of GPT-Image in both vanilla and agentic settings to its weaker instruction following and text rendering capabilities compared to Nano-Banana-Pro, which fails to meet the strict requirements 1According to existing literatures (Cohen, 2013; Hollander et al., 2013), Kendalls tau correlation exceeding 0.4 is generally considered to represent relatively strong agreement 7 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Table 2 Ablation study on PaperBananaBench. The shaded row indicates the default setting of PaperBanana. We systematically ablate each agent component to assess its contribution. The symbol denotes the Random Retriever which randomly selects 10 examples instead of performing semantic retrieval.

Similarly, while Paper2Any also supports generating paper figures, it prioritizes the presentation of high-level ideas rather than the faithful depiction of specific methodological flows necessary for methodology diagrams. This objective mismatch leads to its underperformance in our evaluation setting. In contrast, PaperBanana achieves comprehensive improvements over the Vanilla Nano-BananaPro baseline: Faithfulness (+2.8%), Conciseness (+37.2%), Readability (+12.9%), and Aesthetics (+6.6%), contributing to +17.0% gain in the Overall score. Regarding performance across categories, Agent & Reasoning achieves the highest overall score (69.9%), followed by Scientific & Application (58.8%) and Generative & Learning (57.0%), while Vision & Perception scores the lowest (52.1%). We also conducted blind human evaluation on subset of 50 cases to compare PaperBanana against vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro (See Appendix for details). The average win / tie / loss rate of PaperBanana from 3 human judges is 72.7% / 20.7% / 6.6%, respectively. This further validates that our agentic workflow shows promising improvements in automated methodology diagram generation. (See Appendix Figure 7 for case studies) Despite the progress, we note that PaperBanana still underperforms the human reference in terms of faithfulness. We have included some failure analysis in Appendix Figure 10 to provide insights into the challenges. 5.4. Ablation Study To understand the contribution of each agent component, we conduct an ablation study, with results presented in Table 2. Impact of the Retriever Agent. We compare the semantic retriever with random and no-retriever baselines (rows ④⑥ in Table 2). Without reference examples as guidance, the no-retriever setting significantly underperforms in Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics, as the Planner defaults to verbose, exhaustive descriptions. Moreover, lacking exposure to academic diagram aesthetics, this setting produces visually less refined outputs. Interestingly, the random retriever achieves performance comparable to the semantic approach, suggesting that providing general structural and stylistic patterns is more critical than precise content matching. Impact of the Stylist and Critic Agents. Comparing rows ③ and ④ shows that the Stylist boosts Conciseness (+17.5%) and Aesthetics (+4.7%) but lowers Faithfulness (-8.5%), as visual polishing sometimes omits technical details. However, the Critic Agent (row ① vs. ③) effectively bridges this 8 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Figure 4 [Generated by ] Vanilla Gemini-3-Pro vs. PaperBanana for statistical plots generation. Figure 5 [Generated by ] Coding vs. Image Generation for visualizing statistical plots. gap, substantially recovering Faithfulness. Additional iterations further enhance all metrics, ensuring balance between aesthetics and technical accuracy. 5.5. PaperBanana for Statistical Plots Generation. PaperBanana operates by first synthesizing detailed description of the target illustration, then visualizing it into an image. Unlike methodology diagrams that prioritize aesthetics and logical coherence, statistical plots demand rigorous numerical precision, making standard image generation models unsuitable. To address this, we demonstrate that by adopting executable code for visualization, PaperBanana seamlessly extends to statistical plot generation. Testset Curation. Following the task formulation in Section 2, we assess PaperBananas capability to generate statistical plots from tabular data and brief visual descriptions. Since raw data of statistical plots is rarely available in academic manuscripts, we repurpose ChartMimic (Yang et al., 2025b), dataset originally constructed for chart-to-code generation. This dataset primarily includes statistical plots from arXiv papers and Matplotlib galleries, paired with human-curated Python code. Leveraging Gemini-3-Pro, we extract the underlying tabular data from the code and synthesize brief description for each plot. Following rigorous filtering and sampling (see Appendix D), we curate 240 test cases and 240 reference examples, stratified across seven plot categoriesbar chart, line chart, tree & pie chart, scatter plot, heatmap, radar chart, and miscellaneousand two complexity levels (easy and hard). For evaluation, we adhere to the protocol detailed in Section 4, with prompts specifically tailored to statistical plots. Figure 4 compares PaperBanana with vanilla Gemini-3-Pro on our curated test set. Our method consistently outperforms the baseline across all dimensions, achieving gains of +1.4%, +5.0%, +3.1%, and +4.0% in Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics, respectively, resulting in +4.1% overall improvement. Notably, PaperBanana slightly surpasses human performance in Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics while remaining competitive in Faithfulness, showcasing its effectiveness for statistical plot. 6. Discussion 6.1. Enhancing Aesthetics of Human-Drawn Diagrams Given the summarized aesthetic guidelines G, an intriguing question arises: can these guidelines serve to elevate the aesthetic quality of existing human-drawn diagrams? To explore this, we implement streamlined pipeline where Gemini-3-Pro first formulates up to 10 actionable suggestions based on 9 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists the original diagram and G, which are then executed by Nano-Banana-Pro to refine the image. We evaluate the results using our referencebased protocol, comparing the refined output against the original human-drawn diagram. Across the 292 test cases, the refined diagrams achieved win / tie / loss ratio of 56.2% / 6.8% / 37.0% in aesthetics against their original counterparts, showing that the summarized aesthetic guidelines can indeed serve to elevate the aesthetic quality of existing human-authored diagrams. An illustrative example is provided in Figure 6. More examples are provided in AppendixFigure 8. Figure 6 Example of enhancing aesthetics of human-drawn diagrams. 6.2. Coding vs Image Generation for Visualizing Statistical Plots For statistical plots, code-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, as evidenced by Figure 4 and prior studies (Chen et al., 2025; Goswami et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024). Given the advanced fidelity and visual appeal of recent image generation models, we compare code-based (Gemini-3-Pro) and image-generation-based (Nano-Banana-Pro) approaches for the Visualizer agent in PaperBanana, as shown in Figure 5. Results reveal distinct trade-offs: image generation excels in presentation (Readability and Aesthetics) but underperforms in content fidelity (Faithfulness and Conciseness). Manual inspection shows that while image models faithfully render sparse plots, they struggle with dense or complex data, exhibiting numerical hallucinations or element repetition (Appendix Figure 9). Thus, hybridly using image generation for sparse visualizations and code for dense plots may offer the best balance. 7. Related Work 7.1. Automated Academic Diagram Generation. Automated academic diagram generation remains long-standing challenge (Rodriguez et al., 2023). Prior work primarily adopts code-based generation using TikZ (Belouadi and Eger, 2024; Belouadi et al., 2025; Hsu and Eger, 2023; Zhang et al., 2025) or Python-PPT (Pang et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025) for programmatic synthesis. While effective for structured content, these approaches face expressiveness limitations in generating the intricate visual designs prevalent in modern AI publications. Recent image generation models have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-fidelity, visually sophisticated figures (Deepmind, 2025; OpenAI, 2025a; Tang et al., 2026; Team et al., 2025; Zuo et al., 2025), offering promising alternative. Concurrent to our work, AutoFigure (Anonymous, 2026) 2 transforms scientific content into symbolic representations before rendering them as images using GPT-Image. In comparison, our method achieves broader generalizability through adaptive retrieval and academic-style transfer, with greater extensibility by supporting both methodology diagrams and statistical plots in unified pipeline. For evaluation benchmarks, quality assessment of auto-generated diagrams remains less explored. Most closely related to PaperBananaBench is SridBench (Chang et al., 2025), which evaluates 2Currently, AutoFigure is still an anonymous preprint. We will update the full citation once it is officially published. 10 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists automated diagram generation from method sections and captions across computer science and natural science domains. We will report results once it is publicly available. 7.2. Coding-Based Data Visualization While the inherent complexity of academic diagram generation has deterred pioneering research, visualizing statistical data has garnered extensive attention since the rise of language models. Early endeavors (Dibia and Demiralp, 2019) employed LSTM-based models to convert JSON data into Vega-Lite visualizations, followed by few-shot and zero-shot coding approaches (Dibia, 2023; Galimzyanov et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024) leveraging large-scale backbones such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022). More recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated remarkable progress in coding-based data visualization (Chen et al., 2025; Goswami et al., 2025; Seo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024), leveraging fundamental mechanisms such as test-time scaling (Snell et al., 2024) and self-reflection (Shinn et al., 2023). While this paper is more focused on automated generation of academic diagrams and plots, these agentic frameworks can be seamlessly integrated into our Visualizer Agent to enhance its capability in translating detailed descriptions of desired plots into robust Python code. Complementary to generation, recent efforts have also explored reversing plots back into their original code (Wu et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2025b), challenging both the perception and coding capabilities of VLMs. 8. Conclusion This paper introduces PaperBanana, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of publication-ready academic illustrations. By orchestrating specialized agentsRetriever, Planner, Stylist, Visualizer, and Criticour approach transforms scientific content into high-fidelity methodology diagrams and statistical plots. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we presented PaperBananaBench, comprehensive benchmark curated from top-tier AI conferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana significantly outperforms existing baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics, paving the way for AI scientists to autonomously communicate their discoveries with professional-grade visualizations. 9. Limitations and Future Directions As pioneering work, although PaperBanana achieves promising results, it inevitably faces certain limitations. This section will discuss these limitations in detail, and outline the corresponding future directions we envision. Towards Editable Academic Illustrations. The most prominent limitation of PaperBanana lies in the raster nature of its output. Unlike vector graphicswhich are preferred in academic contexts for their infinite scalability and precise detail preservationraster images are inherently difficult to edit. While generating outputs at 4K resolution serves as viable workaround to ensure high visual fidelity, it does not fundamentally resolve the challenge of post-generation modification. To address this, we envision three potential solutions catering to varying levels of editing needs. For minor visual adjustments, leveraging state-of-the-art image editing models, such as Nano-Banana-Pro, serves as the most direct approach. For more structural modifications, reconstruction pipeline as exemplified by Paper2Any (Liu et al., 2025) and Edit Banana (BIT-DataLab, 2025) can be adopted: employing OCR for text extraction and SAM3 for pattern segmentation, followed by reassembling these elements on presentation slides (e.g., via Python-PPTX). While currently facing challenges when handling complex backgrounds and intricate visual elements, we anticipate that training specialized element extraction 11 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists models will significantly enhance the robustness of this reconstruction. Finally, more advanced direction involves developing GUI Agent capable of autonomously operating professional vector design software (Huang et al., 2026; Sun et al., 2025), such as Adobe Illustrator. This would enable the direct generation of fully editable vector graphics, although it necessitates the agent to possess exceptional perception, planning and interaction capabilities. The Trade-off between Style Standardization and Diversity. The second limitation lies in the trade-off between style standardization and diversity. While our unified style guide ensures rigid compliance with academic standards, it inevitably reduces the stylistic diversity of the output. Future work could explore more dynamic style adaptation mechanisms that allow for broader range of artistic expressions and personalized aesthetic choices while maintaining professional rigor. The Challenge of Fine-Grained Faithfulness. While PaperBanana excels in aesthetics, performance gap in faithfulness compared to human experts remains. As shown in our failure analysis (Figure 10 in the Appendix), the most prevalent errors involve fine-grained connectivity, such as misaligned start/end points or incorrect arrow directions. These subtleties often escape the detection of current critic models, limiting the efficacy of self-correction. We posit that closing this gap primarily hinges on advancing the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the foundation VLMs. Advancing Evaluation Paradigms. Following existing practices, our evaluation adopts referencebased VLM-as-a-Judge setup. Despite its effectiveness, we acknowledge that this evaluation paradigm still faces inherent challenges. First, regarding faithfulness, quantifying structural correctness remains challenging, as detecting subtle errors in connectivity and notation requires high-precision scrutiny. Future protocols could benefit from incorporating fine-grained, structure-based (Liang and You, 2025) or rubric-based (Huang et al., 2026; Li et al., 2025) metrics, which may offer higher accuracy despite their increased computational complexity. Second, for subjective dimensions such as aesthetics, we observe that textual prompting is often insufficient to fully align the VLM with human preferences. We envision that training customized reward models to bridge this alignment gap represents crucial direction for future research. Test-Time Scaling for Diverse Preferences. Currently, our framework produces single output for each query. However, given the inherent stochasticity of generative models and the subjectivity of aesthetic preferences, single result may not universally satisfy diverse user tastes. natural extension is to implement test-time scaling by generating spectrum of candidates with varying styles and compositions. This paradigm shifts the focus from single-shot generation to generate-and-select workflow, enabling either human users or VLM-based preference models to select the illustration that best aligns with their specific requirements. Extension to Broader Domains. Beyond academic illustrations, our framework establishes generalizable paradigm: leveraging retrieval to instruct the model on what to generate (target diagram types) and employing automatic style summarization to teach it how to generate (stylistic norms). By effectively decoupling structural planning from aesthetic rendering, this reference-driven approach bypasses the need for expensive domain-specific fine-tuning. We believe this paradigm holds significant promise for other specialized domains requiring strict adherence to community standards, such as UI/UX design, patent drafting, and industrial schematics."

Our goal is to democratize access to high-quality visual communication tools, particularly benefiting researchers who may lack professional design resources. By reducing the manual effort required for diagram creation, we aim to accelerate the scientific workflow. However, we acknowledge the ethical risk associated with generative models, specifically the potential for visual hallucination or unfaithful representation of technical details. It is imperative that users of such systems reject blind reliance and maintain rigorous human oversight to ensure the scientific integrity of published illustrations."

Dedicated Case Studies Cases Demonstrating the Effectiveness of PaperBanana We provide 2 cases in Figure 7 to demonstrate the capability of PaperBanana for aiding the generation of academic illustrations. Given the same source context and caption, the vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro often produces diagrams with outdated color tones and overly verbose content. In contrast, our PaperBanana generates results that are more concise and aesthetically pleasing, while maintaining faithfulness to the source context. Figure 7 Case study of diagram generation.

It is observed that the image generation model can generate more visually appealing plots, but incurs more faithfulness errors such as numerical hallucination or element repetition. The red bounding boxes are added by the authors to highlight the errors. PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Failure Cases of PaperBanana. Figure 10 shows 3 failure cases of PaperBanana. We observe that the primary failure mode involves connection errors, such as redundant connections and mismatched source-target nodes. Our preliminary analysis reveals that the critic model often fails to identify these connectivity issues, suggesting these errors may originate from the foundation models inherent perception limitations. Resolving this challenge likely necessitates advancements in the underlying foundation model. Figure 10 Failure cases of PaperBanana.

Resolving this challenge likely necessitates advancements in the underlying foundation model. 20 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists B. Human Evaluation Setup To ensure the reliability of our automated metrics and strict benchmarking of our method, this paper conducted two distinct human evaluation experiments. Both evaluations employed the same four dimensions defined in Section 4 (Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics) and adhered to the same detailed rubrics used by our VLM judge. We utilized Streamlit to build dedicated annotation interfaces for these tasks. Validation of VLM-as-a-Judge. The objective of this human evaluation is to assess the alignment between our VLM-based judge (Gemini-3-Pro) and human judgment. We randomly sampled 50 cases (25 from the Vanilla baseline and 25 from PaperBanana) from the test set. For each case, two experienced researchers were presented with the Method Section, Caption, the human-drawn reference diagram, and model-generated candidate (either from our method or the baseline). They were tasked with conducting side-by-side comparison on the four evaluation dimensions. For conflicting cases, they engaged in discussion to reach consensus. For each dimension, the annotator selected one of four outcomes: Model wins, Human wins, Both are good, or Both are bad. These choices were then mapped to numerical scores (100, 0, 50, 50) to calculate the Kendalls tau correlation with the VLM judges scores, as reported in Section 5. The annotation interface is shown in Figure 11. Blind Test for Main Results. To rigorously compare PaperBanana against the strong baseline (Vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro), we conducted blind A/B test on subset of 50 cases. Three experienced researchers were presented with the Method Section, Caption, Reference (Human Drawn) diagram, and two anonymous candidates (Candidate and Candidate B) in randomized order. To determine the winner, we enforced hierarchical decision strategy consistent with our VLM evaluation protocol. Annotators first evaluated the Primary Dimensions (Faithfulness and Readability). If candidate won in the primary dimensions (or won one and tied the other), it was declared the overall winner. In cases of tie in primary dimensions, the decision was deferred to the Secondary Dimensions (Conciseness and Aesthetics). This setup ensures that our human evaluation prioritizes content correctness and clarity, mirroring the rigorous standards of academic publication. The annotation interface is shown in Figure 12. Figure 11 Annotation interface for reference-based evaluation. 21 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Figure 12 Annotation interface for blind human evaluation. C. Implementation Details Categorization of Methodology Diagrams. To facilitate detailed analysis, we categorize the diagrams into four classes based on visual topology and content. The detailed definitions and keywords for each category are listed in Table 3. Additional Experiment Settings. For all experiments, we set the generation temperature to 1. To ensure fair comparisons, we align the aspect ratio of the generated images with their human-drawn counterparts. Specifically, we calculate the aspect ratio of the ground-truth diagram and match it to the nearest ratio supported by the image generation model (e.g., for Nano-Banana-Pro, we round to the closest among 3:2, 16:9, and 21:9). Generating Diagrams and Plots used in this Paper. All figures in this paper marked with [Generated by ] are produced entirely by PaperBanana. In practice, given the inherent variability of generative models, we generated multiple candidates and manually selected the best one for presentation. We recommend this generate-and-select workflow for practical applications of PaperBanana. D. Testset Curation for Statistical Plots Generation This section introduces the testset curation process for statistical plots generation, which evaluates the capability to generate statistical plots from raw data (e.g., tables, CSV files) and high-level visual descriptions (e.g. bar plot titled \"Number of Publications by Year\"). Since academic manuscripts rarely include raw data for their published plots, we repurpose ChartMimic (Yang et al., 2025b), dataset originally designed for chart-to-code evaluation. Specifically, we use the direct mimic subset, which contains 2,400 plots sourced majorly from arXiv papers and matplotlib galleries, each paired with human-curated Python code for reproduction. This enables us to systematically extract both the underlying data and visual descriptions, while using the plots themselves as ground truth. Specifically, the pipeline is as follows: 22 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Table 3 Categorization of diagrams based on visual topology and content. 1.

We begin with all 2,400 plots from the direct mimic subset. Using Gemini3-Pro, we extract the raw data from the code into tabular format, generate high-level description of each plots visual intent, while also marking the difficulty of generating the plot (Specifically, plots with many data points or subplots are marked as difficult, while plots with only 1 subplot and few data points are marked as easy). Meanwhile, we also apply two filtering criteria: (1) Reproducible Data: exclude plots where data is randomly generated or requires complex computations; (2) Standard Mapping: exclude plots using data for geometric construction (e.g., drawing shapes) rather than conventional statistical visualization. Similar to our methodology diagram curation, we filter out plots with aspect ratios (𝑤 : ℎ) outside [1.0, 2.5] to support future exploration with image generation models. This yields 914 plots. Categorization. ChartMimics original 22 plot categories include many types rarely used in academic publications, such as Pip chart and Quiver chart. Based on the distribution of our 914 filtered plots, we consolidate them into 7 common categories: Bar Chart, Line Chart, Tree & Pie Chart, Scatter Plot, Heatmap, Radar Chart, and Miscellaneous (all other types). Sampling. We then sample 80 plots per category, except for Heatmap and Radar Chart (40 each due to limited availability), yielding 480 plots total. During sampling, we intentionally increased the proportion of difficult cases to ensure challenging testset. Each category is then evenly split into reference and test sets. 23 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists E. Textual Description of our Methodology Diagram Our framework operates by first synthesizing detailed description of the target diagram, which is then visualized by Nano-Banana-Pro. To facilitate reproduction and inspire future research, we provide below the exact textual description synthesized by our framework during the actual inference run that produced Figure 2, which served as the input to the Visualizer. When using Nano-Banana-Pro, we set the (width:height) aspect ratio as 21:9, temperature as 1, and resolution as 2K.

The \"NeurIPS Look\" The prevailing aesthetic for 2025 is **\"Soft Tech & Scientific Pastels.\"** Gone are the days of harsh primary colors and sharp black boxes. The modern NeurIPS diagram feels approachable yet precise. It utilizes high-value ( light) backgrounds to organize complexity, reserving saturation for the most critical active elements. The vibe balances **clean modularity** ( clear separation of parts) with **narrative flow** (clear left-to-right progression). --- ### 2. Detailed Style Options PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists #### **A. Color Palettes** *Design Philosophy: Use color to group logic, not just to decorate. Avoid fully saturated backgrounds.* **Background Fills (The \"Zone\" Strategy)** *Used to encapsulate stages (e.g., \"Pre-training phase\") or environments.* * * **Most papers use:** Very light, desaturated pastels (Opacity 10-15%). **Aesthetically pleasing options include:** * * * * **Alternative (20%):** White backgrounds with colored *dashed borders* for high-contrast, minimalist look (common in theoretical papers). **Cream / Beige** (e.g., #F5F5DC) - *Warm, academic feel.* **Pale Blue / Ice** (e.g., #E6F3FF) - *Clean, technical feel.* **Mint / Sage** (e.g., #E0F2F1) - *Soft, organic feel.* **Pale Lavender** (e.g., #F3E5F5) - *distinctive, modern feel.* * **Functional Element Colors** * **For \"Active\" Modules (Encoders, MLP, Attention):** Medium saturation is preferred. * * rather than component type: *Common pairings:* Blue/Orange, Green/Purple, or Teal/Pink. *Observation:* Colors are often used to distinguish **status** * **Trainable Elements:** Often Warm tones (Red, Orange, Deep Pink ). * **Frozen/Static Elements:** Often Cool tones (Grey, Ice Blue, * Cyan). **For Highlights/Results:** High saturation (Primary Red, Bright Gold) is strictly reserved for \"Error/Loss,\" \"Ground Truth,\" or the final output. #### **B. Shapes & Containers** *Design Philosophy: \"Softened Geometry.\" Sharp corners are for data; rounded corners are for processes.* **Core Components** * **Process Nodes (The Standard):** Rounded Rectangles (Corner radius 5-10 px). This is the dominant shape (80%) for generic layers or steps. **Tensors & Data:** * times W$). * **3D Stacks/Cuboids:** Used to imply depth/volume (e.g., $B times **Flat Squares/Grids:** Used for matrices, tokens, or attention maps. **Cylinders:** Exclusively reserved for Databases, Buffers, or * Memory. **Grouping & Hierarchy** * **The \"Macro-Micro\" Pattern:** solid, light-colored container represents the global view, with specific module (e.g., \"Attention Block\") connected via lines to \"zoomed-in\" detailed breakout box. **Borders:** * * Optional Paths,\" or \"Scopes.\" **Solid:** For physical components. **Dashed:** Highly prevalent for indicating \"Logical Stages,\" \" * * PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists #### **C. Lines & Arrows** *Design Philosophy: Line style dictates flow type.* **Connector Styles** * * **Orthogonal / Elbow (Right Angles):** Most papers use this for ** Network Architectures** (implies precision, matrices, and tensors). **Curved / Bezier:** Common choices include this for **System Logic, Feedback Loops, or High-Level Data Flow** (implies narrative and connection). **Line Semantics** * * **Solid Black/Grey:** Standard data flow (Forward pass). **Dashed Lines:** Universally recognized as \"Auxiliary Flow.\" * *Used for:* Gradient updates, Skip connections, or Loss calculations. * **Integrated Math:** Standard operators ($oplus$ for Add, $otimes$ for Concat/Multiply) are frequently placed *directly* on the line or intersection. #### **D. Typography & Icons** *Design Philosophy: Strict separation between \"Labeling\" and \"Math.\"* **Typography** * * *Style:* Bold for headers, Regular for details. **Labels (Module Names):** **Sans-Serif** (Arial, Roboto, Helvetica). * **Variables (Math):** **Serif** (Times New Roman, LaTeX default). * mathcal{L}$), it **must** be Serif and Italicized in the diagram. *Rule:* If it is variable in your equation (e.g., $x, theta, **Iconography Options** * **For Model State:** * * **For Operations:** * * **For Content:** * * * * --- *Trainable:* Fire, Lightning. *Frozen:* Snowflake, Padlock, Stop Sign (Greyed out). *Inspection:* Magnifying Glass. *Processing/Computation:* Gear, Monitor. *Text/Prompt:* Document, Chat Bubble. *Image:* Actual thumbnail of an image (not just square). ### 3. Common Pitfalls (How to look \"Amateur\") * **The \"PowerPoint Default\" Look:** Using standard Blue/Orange presets with heavy black outlines. **Font Mixing:** Using Times New Roman for \"Encoder\" labels (makes the paper look dated to the 1990s). **Inconsistent Dimension:** Mixing flat 2D boxes and 3D isometric cubes without clear reason (e.g., 2D for logic, 3D for tensors is fine; random mixing is not). **Primary Backgrounds:** Using saturated Yellow or Blue backgrounds for grouping (distracts from the content). **Ambiguous Arrows:** Using the same line style for \"Data Flow\" and \" Gradient Flow.\" * * * * 27 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists --- ### 4. Domain-Specific Styles **If you are writing an AGENT / LLM Paper:** * * **Vibe:** Illustrative, Narrative, \"Friendly.\", Cartoony. **Key Elements:** Use \"User Interface\" aesthetics. Chat bubbles for prompts, document icons for retrieval. **Characters:** It is common to use cute 2D vector robots, human avatars, or emojis to humanize the agents reasoning steps. * **If you are writing COMPUTER VISION / 3D Paper:** * * * **Vibe:** Spatial, Dense, Geometric. **Key Elements:** Frustums (camera cones), Ray lines, and Point Clouds. **Color:** Often uses RGB color coding to denote axes or channel correspondence. Use heatmaps (Rainbow/Viridis) to show activation. **If you are writing THEORETICAL / OPTIMIZATION Paper:** * * **Vibe:** Minimalist, Abstract, \"Textbook.\" **Key Elements:** Focus on graph nodes (circles) and manifolds (planes/ surfaces). **Color:** Restrained. mostly Grayscale/Black/White with one highlight color (e.g., Gold or Blue). Avoid \"cartoony\" elements. * Style Guide for Statistical Plots # NeurIPS 2025 Statistical Plot Aesthetics Guide ## 1. The \"NeurIPS Look\": High-Level Overview The prevailing aesthetic for 2025 is defined by **precision, accessibility, and high contrast**. The \"default\" academic look has shifted away from bare-bones styling toward more graphic, publication-ready presentation. * * * **Vibe:** Professional, clean, and information-dense. **Backgrounds:** There is heavy bias toward **stark white backgrounds ** for maximum contrast in print and PDF reading, though the \"Seabornstyle\" light grey background remains an accepted variant. **Accessibility:** strong emphasis on distinguishing data not just by color, but by texture (patterns) and shape (markers) to support black-and -white printing and colorblind readers. --- ## 2. Detailed Style Options ### **Color Palettes** * **Soft Pastels:** Matte, low-saturation colors (salmon, sky blue, **Categorical Data:** * mint, lavender) are frequently used to prevent visual fatigue. * grey, and navy. **Muted Earth Tones:** \"Academic\" palettes using olive, beige, slate 28 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists * **High-Contrast Primaries:** Used sparingly when categories must be * distinct (e.g., deep orange vs. vivid purple). **Accessibility Mode:** growing trend involves combining color * with **geometric patterns** (hatches, dots, stripes) to differentiate categories. **Sequential & Heatmaps:** * Plasma\" (purple-to-orange) are the standard. * negative value splits. * absent. **Perceptually Uniform:** \"Viridis\" (blue-to-yellow) and \"Magma/ **Diverging:** \"Coolwarm\" (blue-to-red) is used for positive/ **Avoid:** The traditional \"Jet/Rainbow\" scale is almost entirely ### **Axes & Grids** * **Placement:** Grids are consistently rendered *behind* data **Grid Style:** **Visibility:** Grid lines are almost rarely solid.

Serif fonts are rarely used for labels. * when necessary to prevent overlap; otherwise, horizontal orientation is preferred. **Legends:** * top-left or top-right) to maximize the \"data-ink ratio.\" * plot title. **Annotations:** **Direct Labeling:** Instead of forcing readers to reference * legend, text is often placed directly next to lines or on top of bars. **Top Horizontal:** Placing the legend in single row above the **Internal Placement:** Floating the legend *inside* the plot area ( * * --- ## 3. Type-Specific Guidelines ### **Bar Charts & Histograms** * **Borders:** Two distinct styles are accepted: * for \"comic-book\" or high-contrast look. * light grey backgrounds). **High-Definition:** Using **black outlines** around colored bars **Borderless:** Solid color fills with no outline (often used with 29 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists * * **Grouping:** Bars are grouped tightly, with significant whitespace between categorical groups. **Error Bars:** Consistently styled with **black, flat caps**. ### **Line Charts** * **Markers:** critical observation: Lines almost always include ** geometric markers** (circles, squares, diamonds) at data points, rather than just being smooth strokes. **Line Styles:** Use **dashed lines** (--) for theoretical limits, baselines, or secondary data, and **solid lines** for primary experimental data. **Uncertainty:** Represented by semi-transparent **shaded bands** ( confidence intervals) rather than simple vertical error bars. ### **Tree & Pie/Donut Charts** * **Separators:** Thick **white borders** are standard to separate slices or treemap blocks. **Structure:** Thick **Donut charts** are preferred over traditional Pie charts. **Emphasis:** \"Exploding\" (detaching) specific slice is common technique to highlight key statistic. ### **Scatter Plots** * **Shape Coding:** Use different marker shapes (e.g., circles vs. triangles) to encode categorical dimension alongside color. **Fills:** Markers are typically solid and fully opaque. **3D Plots:** Depth is emphasized by drawing \"walls\" with grids or using drop-lines to the \"floor\" of the plot. ### **Heatmaps** * * **Aspect Ratio:** Cells are almost strictly **square**. **Annotation:** Writing the exact value (in white or black text) ** inside the cell** is highly preferred over relying solely on color bar. **Borders:** Cells are often borderless (smooth gradient look) or separated by very thin white lines. ### **Radar Charts** * **Fills:** The polygon area uses **translucent fills** (alpha 0.2) to show grid lines underneath. **Perimeter:** The outer boundary is marked by solid, darker line. ### **Miscellaneous** * **Dot Plots:** Used as modern alternative to bar charts; often styled as \"lollipops\" (dots connected to the axis by thin line). --- ## 4. Common Pitfalls (What to Avoid) * **The \"Excel Default\" Look:** Avoid heavy 3D effects on bars, shadow drops, or serif fonts (Times New Roman) on axes. **The \"Rainbow\" Map:** Avoid the Jet/Rainbow colormap; it is considered outdated and perceptually misleading. **Ambiguous Lines:** line chart *without* markers can look ambiguous if data points are sparse; always add markers. * * * * * * * * * * 30 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists * * **Over-reliance on Color:** Failing to use patterns or shapes to distinguish groups makes the plot inaccessible to colorblind readers. **Cluttered Grids:** Avoid solid black grid lines; they compete with the data. Always use light grey/dashed grids. F.2. Automated Style Guide Summarization To distill comprehensive style guide from top-tier AI conference papers, we employ hierarchical summarization pipeline. We first partition the reference images (methodology diagrams or statistical plots) into batches. For each batch, we prompt Gemini-3-Pro to analyze the visual patternsincluding color palettes, shapes, and typographyand generate local design report.

System Prompt for Diagram Agents System Prompt for Retriever Agent (methodology diagram) # Background & Goal We are building an **AI system to automatically generate method diagrams for academic papers**. Given papers methodology section and figure caption, the system needs to create high-quality illustrative diagram that visualizes the described method. To help the AI learn how to generate appropriate diagrams, we use **fewshot learning approach**: we provide it with reference examples of similar papers and their corresponding diagrams. The AI will learn from these examples to understand what kind of diagram to create for the 34 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists target paper. # Your Task **You are the Retrieval Agent.** Your job is to select the most relevant reference papers from candidate pool that will serve as few-shot examples for the diagram generation model. You will receive: - **Target Input:** The methodology section and caption of the paper for which we need to generate diagram - **Candidate Pool:** 200 existing papers (each with methodology and caption) You must select the **Top 10 candidates** that would be most helpful as examples for teaching the AI how to draw the target diagram. # Selection Logic (Topic + Intent) Your goal is to find examples that match the Target in both **Domain** and **Diagram Type**. **1. Match Research Topic (Use Methodology & Caption):** * What is the domain? (e.g., Agent & Reasoning, Vision & Perception, Generative & Learning, Science & Applications). * Select candidates that belong to the **same research domain**. * *Why?* Similar domains share similar terminology (e.g., \"Actor-Critic\" in RL). **2. Match Visual Intent (Use Caption & Keywords):** * What type of diagram is implied? (e.g., \"Framework\", \"Pipeline\", \"Detailed Module\", \"Performance Chart\"). * Select candidates with **similar visual structures**. * *Why?* \"Framework\" diagram example is useless for drawing \"Performance Bar Chart\", even if they are in the same domain. **Ranking Priority:** 1. **Best Match:** Same Topic AND Same Visual Intent (e.g., Target is \" Agent Framework\" -> Candidate is \"Agent Framework\", Target is \"Dataset Construction Pipeline\" -> Candidate is \"Dataset Construction Pipeline\"). **Second Best:** Same Visual Intent (e.g., Target is \"Agent Framework\" -> Candidate is \"Vision Framework\"). *Structure is more important than Topic for drawing.* **Avoid:** Different Visual Intent (e.g., Target is \"Pipeline\" -> Candidate is \"Bar Chart\"). 2. 3. # Input Data ## Target Input - - **Caption:** [Caption of the target diagram] **Methodology section:** [Methodology section of the target paper] ## Candidate Pool List of candidate papers, each structured as follows: 35 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Candidate Paper i: - - - **Paper ID:** [ID of the target paper (ref_1, ref_2, ...)] **Caption:** [Caption of the target diagram] **Methodology section:** [Methodology section of the target paper] # Output Format Provide your output strictly in the following JSON format, containing only the **exact Paper IDs** of the Top 10 selected papers (use the exact IDs from the Candidate Pool, such as \"ref_1\", \"ref_25\", \"ref_100\", etc.): json { \"top_10_papers\": [ \"ref_1\", \"ref_25\", \"ref_100\", \"ref_42\", \"ref_7\", \"ref_156\", \"ref_89\", \"ref_3\", \"ref_201\", \"ref_67\" ] } System Prompt for Planner Agent (methodology diagram) am working on task: given the Methodology section of paper, and the caption of the desired figure, automatically generate corresponding illustrative diagram. will input the text of the Methodology section, the figure caption, and your output should be detailed description of an illustrative figure that effectively represents the methods described in the text.

Write code to generate highquality statistical plots based on user requests. System Prompt for Critic Agent (statistical plot) ## ROLE You are Lead Visual Designer for top-tier AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS 2025). ## TASK Your task is to conduct sanity check and provide critique of the target plot based on its content and presentation. You must ensure its alignment with the provided Raw Data and Visual Intent. You are also provided with the Detailed Description corresponding to the current plot. If you identify areas for improvement in the plot, you must list your specific critique and provide revised version of the Detailed Description that incorporates these corrections. ## CRITIQUE & REVISION RULES 1. Content - **Data Fidelity & Alignment:** Ensure the plot accurately represents all data points from the \"Raw Data\" and aligns with the \"Visual Intent.\" All quantitative values must be correct. No data should be hallucinated, omitted, or misrepresented. **Text QA:** Check for typographical errors, nonsensical text, or - unclear labels within the plot (axis labels, legend entries, annotations) . Suggest specific corrections. 42 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists **Validation of Values:** Verify the accuracy of all numerical - values, axis scales, and data points. If any values are incorrect or inconsistent with the raw data, provide the correct values. - 1: Performance comparison...\") is **not** included within the image **Caption Exclusion:** Ensure the figure caption text (e.g., \"Figure visual itself. The caption should remain separate. 2. Presentation **Clarity & Readability:** Evaluate the overall visual clarity. If - the plot is confusing, cluttered, or hard to interpret, suggest structural improvements (e.g., better axis labeling, clearer legend, appropriate plot type). - **Overlap & Layout:** Check for any overlapping elements that reduce readability, such as text labels being obscured by heavy hatching, grid lines, or other chart elements (e.g., pie chart labels inside dark slices ). If overlaps exist, suggest adjusting element positions (e.g., moving labels outside the chart, using leader lines, or adjusting transparency). **Legend Management:** Be aware that the description&plot may - include text-based legend explaining symbols or colors. Since this is typically redundant in well-designed plots, please excise such descriptions if found. 3. Handling Generation Failures **Invalid Plot:** If the target plot is missing or replaced by - system notice (e.g., \"[SYSTEM NOTICE]\"), it means the previous description generated invalid code. **Action:** You must carefully analyze the \"Detailed Description\" - for potential logical errors, complex syntax, or missing data references. **Revision:** Provide simplified and robust version of the - description to ensure it can be correctly rendered. Do not just repeat the same description. ## INPUT DATA - - - - **Target Plot**: [The generated plot] **Detailed Description**: [The detailed description of the plot] **Raw Data**: [The raw data to be visualized] **Visual Intent**: [Visual intent of the desired plot] ## OUTPUT Provide your response strictly in the following JSON format. json { \"critic_suggestions\": \"Insert your detailed critique and specific suggestions for improvement here.

Evaluation Prompts for Methodology Diagrams We provide the detailed system prompts used for our VLM-based judge across the four evaluation dimensions: Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics. System Prompt for Faithfulness Evaluation (methodology diagram) # Role You are an expert judge in academic visual design. Your task is to evaluate the **Faithfulness** of **Model Diagram** by comparing it against ** Human-drawn Diagram**. # Inputs 1. 2. 3. 4. **Method Section**: [content] **Diagram Caption**: [content] **Human-drawn Diagram (Human)**: [image] **Model-generated Diagram (Model)**: [image] # Core Definition: What is Faithfulness? **Faithfulness** is the technical alignment between the diagram and the papers content. faithful diagram must be factually correct, logically sound, and strictly follow the figure scope described in the **Caption**. It must preserve the **core logic flow** and **module interactions** mentioned in the Method Section without introducing fabrication. While simplification is encouraged (e.g., using single block for standard module), any visual element present must have direct, non-contradictory basis in the text. **Important**: Since \"smart simplification\" is typically allowed and encouraged in academic diagrams, when comparing the two diagrams, the one which looks simpler does not mean it is less faithful. As long as both the diagrams preserve the core logic flow and module interactions mentioned in the Method Section without introducing fabrication, and adhere to the caption, you should report \"Both are good\". # Veto Rules (The \"Red Lines\") **If diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the 1. 2. 3. 4. faithfulness test immediately:** **Major Hallucination:** Inventing modules, entities, or functional connections that are not mentioned in the method section. **Logical Contradiction:** The visual flow directly opposes the described method (e.g., reversing the data direction or bypassing essential steps), or missing necessary connections between modules. **Scope Violation:** The content presented in the diagram is inconsistent with the figure scope described in the **Caption**. **Gibberish Content:** Boxes or arrows containing nonsensical text, garbled labels, or fake mathematical notation (e.g., broken LaTeX characters). # Decision Criteria Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above. 44 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists - - - - **Model**: The Model-generated diagram better embodies the Core Definition of Faithfulness while avoiding all Veto errors. **Human**: The Human-drawn diagram better embodies the Core Definition of Faithfulness while avoiding all Veto errors. **Both are good**: Both diagrams successfully embody the Core Definition of Faithfulness without any Veto errors. **Both are bad**: - - errors. - Definition.

It must distill complex logic into clean blocks, flowcharts, or icons. The ideal diagram relies on **structural shorthand ** (arrows, grouping) and **keywords** rather than explicit descriptions, heavy mathematical notation, or dense textual explanations. # Veto Rules (The \"Red Lines\") **If diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the conciseness test immediately:** 45 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists 1. 2. 3. **Textual Overload:** Boxes contain structural descriptions consisting of full sentences, verb phrases, or lengthy text (more than 15 words). * *Exception:* Full sentences are **permitted** only if they are explicitly displaying **data examples** (e.g., an input query or sample text). **Literal Copying:** The diagram appears to be \"box-ified\" copy-paste of the Method Section text with no visual abstraction. **Math Dump:** The diagram is cluttered with raw equations instead of conceptual blocks. # Decision Criteria Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above. - - - - **Model**: The Model better embodies the Core Definition of conciseness (higher signal-to-noise ratio) while avoiding all Veto errors. **Human**: The Human better embodies the Core Definition of conciseness (higher signal-to-noise ratio) while avoiding all Veto errors. **Both are good**: Both diagrams successfully achieve high-level abstraction and strictly adhere to the Conciseness definition without Veto errors. **Both are bad**: - - signal-to-noise ratio). - Definition.

The goal is for reader to understand the data paths at glance. **Important**: Readability is **baseline requirement**, not differentiator. Most well-constructed academic diagrams are readable. Only severe violations of the Veto Rules below constitute readability failures. Minor stylistic differences in layout or design choices should NOT be judged as readability issues. # Veto Rules (The \"Red Lines\") **If diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the readability 1. test immediately:** **Visual Noise & Extraneous Elements:** The diagram contains non-content elements that interfere with information extraction, including: * rendered within the image pixels. The Figure Title (e.g., \"Figure 1: ...\") or full caption text * *Note:* Subfigure labels like (a), (b) or \"Module A\" are ** permitted** and encouraged. * subplot titles rendered twice). Duplicated text labels appearing without semantic purpose (e.g., * *Note:* **Intentional repetition** for demonstrating logic (e.g., repeating \"Sampling\" block multiple times to show iterations) is ** acceptable**. * Watermarks or other meta-information that clutters the visual space. **Occlusion & Overlap:** Text labels overlapping with arrows, shapes, or other text, making them unreadable. **Chaotic Routing:** Arrows that form \"spaghetti loops\" or have excessive, unnecessary crossings that make the path impossible to trace correctly. **Illegible Font Size:** Text that is too small to be read without extreme zooming, or font sizes that vary inconsistently throughout the diagram. **Low Contrast:** Using light-colored text on light backgrounds (or dark on dark) that makes labels invisible or extremely hard to decipher. **Inefficient Layout (Non-Rectangular Composition):** The diagram fails to use compact rectangular layout, resulting in wasted space: **Protruding elements:** Small components (e.g., legends, sub-plots) * positioned outside the main content frame, creating large empty margins 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. **Unbalanced empty corners:** Content clusters in one region while or \"dead zones\" within the bounding box. * leaving disproportionately large blank areas in other corners. * boxes, any element protruding above the main block forces text to wrap **LaTeX incompatibility:** Since LaTeX treats figures as rectangular around the highest point, wasting vertical space in publications. * *Note:* Intentional white space for visual hierarchy is acceptable. This rule targets diagrams where the layout is clearly inefficient for 47 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists 7. academic publication. **Using black background:** The diagram uses black as the background color, which is typically not compatible with academic publications. # Decision Criteria **CRITICAL**: Readability is pass/fail criterion based on Veto Rules.
