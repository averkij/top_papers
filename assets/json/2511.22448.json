BPMN diagrams are extensively used in enterprise environments, particularly for process documentation, compliance tracking, and training [25]. However, these diagrams are often embedded in static formats such as PDF handbooks, training slides, or scanned documentation where the original XML-based BPMN source is not available. This lack of access to the structured source format presents significant challenge for downstream applications that rely on semantic process data, such as simulation [29], automated migration [37], conformance checking [52], or integration with workflow engines. In this work, we present vision-based approach for structured BPMN understanding using state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) [2, 1, 22, 49, 48]. Our method treats BPMN diagrams as visual inputs and extracts structured JSON representations using prompt that guides the model to detect and label each process element. The prompt instructs the model to identify and classify core components based on their visual layout. To improve coverage, especially in cases where labels are missing, low-contrast, or partially obscured, we introduce optional OCR-based enrichment using lightweight text extractors. This hybrid pipeline enables accurate recovery of BPMN semantics from images alone, without relying on the original XML source. Our contributions are as follows: We propose prompt-based pipeline for extracting structured representations from BPMN diagrams using VLM. We release BPMN dataset with diagramXML pairs for further research. We benchmark range of VLMs and analyze OCR impact on extraction quality. We perform detailed ablation experiments and analysis to study the effect of different prompt types."

            "content": "Much of the recent progress in process automation comes from advances in LLMs. Early research relied on symbolic NLP and semantic role labeling to turn natural language into BPMN models [13], but new systems use LLMs like GPT to improve accuracy and user interaction [44, 40, 31]. Tools such as Nala2BPMN [40] and [31] combine these models with visualization toolkits, making process modeling more accessible. SAC26, March 2327, 2026, Thessaloniki, Greece P. Deka and B. Devereux Several modern frameworks take this further. ProMoAI [28] lets users iteratively refine BPMN models from text and export them in multiple formats. The MAO Framework [32] uses teams of LLM agents working in dialogue to collaboratively improve process models, while Opus [11] integrates LLMs with knowledge graphs to optimize business process outsourcing workflows. Although their goals differ, with ProMoAI focusing on user feedback, MAO on multi-agent teamwork, and Opus on domain knowledge, they all demonstrate how LLMs can automate and enhance BPMN generation. At finer level, studies like [6] demonstrate that GPT-3 can extract process elements and relationships from text using prompt engineering alone, and [31] shows that combining LLMs with NLP pre-processing tools like spaCy and BERT [10] improves extraction quality. These works highlight that, with the right prompts and minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can provide structured BPMN outputs without requiring specialized training. Beyond just generating diagrams, LLMs have been applied to explanation and interactive analysis of process models. For example, [39] proposes combining case-based reasoning with LLMs for grounded explanations, and[18] and [27] extend LLM use to tasks such as anomaly detection and process refinement. Some research takes data-driven angle: [9] shows that process models can also be discovered from execution event logs, not just text, demonstrating the versatility of LLM-based approaches."

VLMs have already shown success in visual question\nanswering, image captioning, and layout understanding [22, 17, 48,\n14]. Recently, researchers have started to apply these models to\nmore structured visual reasoning, including tasks with symbolic\ndiagrams [33, 57, 7, 41].",
            "content": "The development of specialized datasets and benchmarks has been instrumental in advancing diagram understanding. In the domain of chart reasoning, resources such as ChartQA [34], ChartBench [56], NovaChart [21], Chartx [55] and ChartInstruct [35] have provided large-scale annotated data for training and evaluating models on quantitative and logical reasoning tasks. On top of these, models like ChartGPT [51], Chartllama [20], Chartgemma [36] and Chartvlm [36] are adapted for chart-specific tasks. For process diagrams, benchmarks such as FlowchartQA [47] and FlowVQA [45] provide diverse synthetic flowcharts paired with questions to evaluate the visual reasoning abilities of VLMs. In contrast, BPMNRedrawer [4] focuses on reconstructing executable BPMN XML representations directly from visual diagrams, task that demands precise recovery of both entities and their relationships. Building on this line of work, our research explores the more challenging and practical scenario of extracting structured BPMN representations directly from images, without relying on any accompanying text, underlying XML, or manual heuristics. We propose an approach that guides VLM using BPMN-specific prompt focused on visual and semantic characteristics, enabling generalization across various layouts and styles. This allows for schemaconstrained recovery of all major BPMN elements (tasks, events, gateways, flows, pools, lanes) from static diagrams alone."

VLMs often struggle with: (1) unlabeled or ambiguous elements, especially gateways and events lacking names; (2) dense layouts, where overlapping elements in multi-pool or multi-lane diagrams cause confusion or omissions; (3) low-contrast or edge-aligned text, particularly on sequence flows; and (4) resolution constraints, as many VLMs rescale input images to fixed sizes, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details in large or wide diagrams (see Section 6.5 and Table 5 for detailed empirical quantification of these errors). Figure 1 shows why VLM-only extraction may be error-prone. The model must identify: (1) the pentagon inside the gateway (an EventBasedGateway); (2) the difference between solid SequenceFlow and dashed MessageFlow; and (3) the envelope IntermediateCatchEvent. These small markers and line styles often vanish when the image is downsampled, which may lead to the misclassifications reported in Section 6.5.

In addition, we include BPMN Redrawer [4] and Sketch2Process [42] as non-VLM baselines. BPMN Redrawer8 converts BPMN images into executable diagrams by combining convolutional neural networks with OCR-based text recognition, while Sketch2Process9 translates hand-drawn sketches into BPMN models using deep learningbased symbol recognition.

            "content": "Strict setting: Top-tier models achieve the best results, though their F1 drops relative to name-only evaluation. GPT-4.1-mini slightly outperforms GPT-4.1, suggesting stronger calibration on type distinctions. OCR brings little benefit at this tier. Mid-tier models benefit substantially from OCR, particularly Pix2Struct and Tesseract, which help recover fine-grained type labels missed in visiononly inference. Low-tier models remain weak; noisy OCR often harms their performance further. The non-VLM baselines also perform competitively here, with Sketch2Process in particular rivaling mid-tier VLMs; their advantage comes from specialized CNN+OCR pipelines tuned for BPMN structure, which compensate for the lack of multimodal reasoning. Relaxed setting: Allowing partial type matches improves recall across all models. Top-tier models remain stable, showing minimal OCR gains, consistent with strong inherent multimodal grounding. Mid-tier models gain most (+35 F1), especially Pixtral-Large and Gemma-12B with Pix2Struct and Tesseract. Low-tier models continue to underperform, with OCR providing little or no benefit."

Table 8: Prompting variants explored in the ablation study for BPMN diagram extraction. Variant Baseline OnlyExample Chain-ofThought (CoT) SelfConsistency DFS+BFS Hybrid Description Original prompt with explicit instructions for extracting BPMN elements, bounding boxes, labels, and flows, along with an example JSON schema. Removes explicit instructions and supplies only the example JSON schema. This condition examines if the model can deduce the extraction strategy implicitly from the example. Adds hidden reasoning instructions: the model is asked to think step-by-step silently (scratchpad) but only emit the final JSON output. Ensures more systematic parsing while preventing verbose outputs. Extends CoT by requiring the model to internally generate multiple candidate outputs and select the most consistent one. Implemented as best-of-3 decoding to reduce random errors and inconsistencies. Augments the baseline with traversal strategy: first apply Breadth-First Search (BFS) to capture overall structure (pools, lanes, tasks, events), then Depth-First Search (DFS) to follow each flow from start to end. Balances structural coverage with flow completeness. Analysis of Prompt Strategies. Table 9 shows that performance varies considerably by prompt type and model. The baseline prompt provides stable but modest scores across all evaluation categories. The Only-Example prompt consistently underperforms, confirming that example schemas alone are insufficient for robust diagram parsing. Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency generally yield incremental gains for models such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, Gemma-12B, suggesting that reasoning and ensemble-style decoding help capture complex control-flow constructs. The DFS+BFS hybrid prompt stands out as the most effective in many cases, especially for entity and relation extraction, as it enforces structural traversal of diagrams and reduces missed flows. Differences across models also highlight capacity effects: larger models exploit advanced prompting more effectively, while smaller models show only modest gains, often limited by representational power rather than prompting strategy. Statistical Significance Test. The significance test results from Table 10 show that prompt strategies which reduce ambiguity, such as the Baseline and especially the DFS+BFS hybrid, consistently outperform alternatives. Baseline works reliably by pairing explicit instructions with an example schema, while DFS+BFS is most effective because its traversal policy mirrors the logical structure of BPMN diagrams, reducing missed dependencies and improving relational accuracy. In contrast, Only-Example performs weakest, as models fail to infer extraction rules from schema alone. Reasoningheavy strategies yield mixed outcomes: Chain-of-Thought adds limited benefit since BPMN extraction depends more on explicit mapping than abstract reasoning, and Self-Consistency mainly Figure 2: Average model ranks across evaluation settings based on the Friedman test.

Model-wise, large models such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o benefit most from structured traversal, mid-sized models (Gemma-12B, Qwen-7B, Pixtral-12B) gain moderately from both DFS+BFS and Self-Consistency, while smaller models (GPT-4.1-mini/nano, Gemma-4B, Qwen-3B) are most sensitive, failing under Only-Example and CoT but performing well for DFS+BFS. For future work, we plan to investigate fine-tuning on larger and more diverse BPMN datasets, with focus on cross-diagram generalization. We will also explore advanced prompt engineering and multi-step reasoning techniques to improve semantic parsing and ensure consistent conversion of BPMN images into executable XML, thereby enabling automated process mining and seamless integration into real-world business environments.

            "title": "9 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis study demonstrates that carefully designed prompts enable\nVLMs to extract structured information from BPMN diagram im-\nages. We conducted a systematic evaluation across four complemen-\ntary settings, entities, relations, types, and name-only, alongside a\nrange of prompting strategies, showing how both the evaluation\nperspective and prompt design shape performance. Our results\nfurther reveal that OCR integration provides selective gains, par-\nticularly for weaker models that struggle to capture structured\nsemantics. To support nuanced comparisons, we also introduced\na tiered evaluation framework (strict and relaxed variants), which\nhighlights robustness and element-level accuracy.",
