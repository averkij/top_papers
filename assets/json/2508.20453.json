Introduction Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new generation of tool-using agents that can interpret natural language instructions, plan multi-step workflows, and interact with external tools to solve complex tasks (OpenAI, 2025c; Comanici et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Kimi et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025). Such agents are increasingly deployed in real-world domains such as travel (Xie et al., 2024), healthcare (Saab et al., 2024; Mehandru et al., 2024), and finance (Xiao et al., 2024), where solving user queries requires chaining multiple tools, reasoning over structured outputs, and coordinating interdependent operations. Despite rapid progress in LLM agents, existing benchmarks for tool use remain fundamentally limited. Early efforts such as ToolBench (Qin et al., 2024) and BFCL v3 (Patil et al., 2025a) aggregate large collections of APIs, but these APIs are designed for isolated functionality. As result, tasks often reduce to few-step tool calls or rely on artificially stitched pipelines, since tool inputs and outputs rarely align naturally across APIs. 𝜏-Bench (Yao et al., 2025) moves step further by selecting small set of APIs whose interfaces are relatively compatible, enabling cleaner compositions. However, its coverage is limited to only handful of domains and tools, making it difficult to scale task diversity or capture the complexity of realistic multi-domain workflows. Together, these benchmarks fall short in modeling realistic dependency chains and stress-testing long-horizon planning. More recent benchmarks such as MCP-RADER (Gao et al., 2025) and MCPEval (Liu et al., 2025a) begin to leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic et al., 2024), which provides standardized invocation schema across servers. However, these benchmarks remain narrow in scope. For example, MCP-RADER (Gao et al., 2025) and MCPEval (Liu et al., 2025a) cover only few servers with at most several dozen tools, which limits task diversity and makes most workflows relatively short (e.g., single retrieval followed by summary). Also, both existing API-based and MCP-based tool-using benchmarks lack testing of Corresponding author(s): Zhenting Wang (zhenting.wang@accenture.com). 2025 Accenture. All rights reserved MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers Figure 1 MCP-Bench connects LLM agents to real-world MCP servers exposing 250 structured tools across domains such as finance, science, and research. Tasks are generated via LLM-based synthesis, then executed by the agent through multi-turn tool invocations. Each execution trajectory is evaluated using combination of rule-based checks and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, assessing agent performance in tool schema understanding, multi-hop planning, and real-world adaptability. planning capability under fuzzy instructions: tasks typically specify the tool name or execution step explicitly, so agents are not challenged to infer which tools are appropriate when the instructions are underspecified. Furthermore, they omit evaluation of more complex scenarios such as multigoal objectives (e.g., booking travel that requires coordinating flights, hotels, and local transport), evidence-based reasoning with information grounding (e.g., generating answers that cite intermediate tool results rather than hallucinating), and cross-domain orchestration (e.g., combining financial tools with news sources to explain stock movements). As summarized in Table 1, none of the existing benchmarks adequately reflect the complexity, fuzzy, and diversity inherent in real-world tool use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MCP-Bench, large-scale benchmark that evaluates LLM agents in realistic, ecosystem-based tool-use scenarios. As illustrated in Figure 1, MCP-Bench connects agents to diverse ecosystem of production-grade MCP servers exposing 250 structured tools across domains such as finance, science, and research. Each server provides complementary tools designed to work together (e.g., scientific computing server integrating data loading, matrix operations, and visualization), while the MCP protocol ensures consistent invocation schemas across servers. This combination enables both realistic intra-server dependency chains and complex cross-server, multi-hop workflows. Tasks in MCP-Bench are generated automatically via an LLM-based synthesis pipeline. Dependency chains are first discovered from tool I/O signatures, then translated into natural language instructions. quality filtering mechanism ensures solvability and realism. To assess agent in realistic scenarios, each task is rewritten into fuzzy and instruction-minimal variant that retains the core objective but omits explicit tool references and execution steps. The example of the tasks in MCP-Bench can be found in Table 2 and Table 9. Each task is executed by the agent Table 1 Comparisons to existing tool-using benchmarks."

Thanks! through multi-turn interactions with MCP servers, and the resulting trajectories are evaluated with two-tier framework: (1) rule-based checks for tool validity, schema compliance, runtime success, and dependency order, and (2) rubric-driven LLM-as-a-Judge scoring of task completion, tool usage, and planning effectiveness. To ensure stability, prompt shuffling and score averaging are applied. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: ① realistic tool-using benchmark that leverages MCP servers to expose 250 tools across 28 servers, enabling both intra-server dependency chains and cross-server orchestration. ② structured task synthesis pipeline that generates both fuzzy instructions of complex, multi-hop tasks grounded in real tool semantics. ③ robust evaluation framework combining rule-based execution checks with rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, enabling comprehensive assessment of execution correctness and strategic reasoning. ④ large-scale empirical study evaluating 20 state-of-the-art LLMs on 104 challenging tasks, revealing persistent weaknesses in agentic capabilities in realistic and complex tool-using scenarios. By bridging the gap between isolated API benchmarks and real-world ecosystems, MCP-Bench provides the standardized and scalable platform for rigorously evaluating the agentic reasoning and tool-use capabilities of LLMs. 3 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers 2. Related Work Benchmarking LLMs. Recent benchmarks have steadily progressed from static evaluations to more interactive, real-world tasks. Early efforts such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2023) focused on single-turn or fixed-format evaluations, testing broad factual knowledge and reasoning via multiple-choice or free-form responses. HELM (Liang et al., 2023) introduced multi-metric evaluation framework over static-text tasks to compare LLMs holistically across accuracy, calibration, fairness, and robustness. More recently, the focus has shifted to reasoning and agentic capabilities (Koh et al., 2024; Kokane et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Du et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025). MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024) increases difficulty via LLM-generated, reasoning-intensive items to reduce contamination. MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) evaluates multi-turn dialogue quality, measuring consistency and contextual coherence. AgentBench (Liu et al., 2024) assesses tool-based decision making in simulated environments. WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024) explores open-ended web navigation, while REALM-Bench (Geng & Chang, 2025) focuses on goal planning under dynamic disruptions. Despite these advances, most benchmarks still fall short of modeling realistic complex workflows where diverse tools should be composed, and intermediate outputs integrated across steps. Evaluating Tool-using Capability. As tasks grow more complex, evaluation now targets reasoning, planning, and execution across tool interfaces. Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023) used fixed browseraction APIs for think-to-act planning, and WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024) added self-hosted domains with embedded tools, yet both depend on hand-crafted toolsets. To broaden tool selection and coordination, subsequent benchmarks pursue broader tool coordination in distinct ways: 𝜏-Bench (Yao et al., 2025) adds simulated users and pass𝑘 end-state checks; BFCL v3 (Patil et al., 2025b) validates multi-turn API workflows via AST analysis; 𝐶3-Bench (Yu et al., 2025) stresses inter-tool dependency reasoning; and ComplexFuncBench (Zhong et al., 2025) adopts rubric-based, execution-verified scoring. Yet all still depend on bespoke toolsets, limiting realism. This gap motivates MCP-based benchmarks, which standardize LLMtool interaction and auto-expose domain-aligned tools. MCPRADAR (Gao et al., 2025) and MCPWorld (Yan et al., 2025) test tool selection, parameterization, and execution within MCP servers yet need manual setup. MCPEval (Liu et al., 2025b) also automates MCP-using task generation and evaluation with five MCP servers. Scalable, cross-server evaluation in real-world MCP ecosystems with complex tasks remains open, motivating our focus on this direction. 3. MCP-Bench Formalization and Design Principles 3.1. Formalization of Tool-using LLM Agent Following Yao et al. (2023), we formalize our benchmark as structured extension of the classical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), tailored to tool-using agents that operate across multiple external servers and tools. Our formulation includes two execution paradigms: (1) one-shot global planning, and (2) multi-turn planning and observation. Each benchmark task is represented as POMDP tuple (S, A, O, 𝑇, 𝑅, U, Σ), where: is the global state space; is the action space including both planning steps and tool invocations; is the observation space containing tool execution results and internal signals; 𝑇 : is the transition and observation function; 𝑅 : [0, 1] is the reward function; denotes the task instruction space; and Σ = {𝜎1, 𝜎2, . . . , 𝜎𝑛} is the set of available MCP servers. Each server 𝜎𝑖 Σ exposes set of tools T𝑖, defining the complete tool set = (cid:208)𝑖 T𝑖. structured tool invocation is written as 𝑎tool = 𝜎𝑖, tool_name, parameters. The full action space is = Aplanning Atools, and the observation space is = Otools Ostate. For the workflow of the agent, we adopt multi-round decision process (Yao et al., 2023). At each round 𝑡, the agent generates plan 𝑎𝑡 conditioned on all previously observed outputs, then executes the tools in 𝑎𝑡, and updates its internal state. This continues for up to 𝑇max (20 in this paper) rounds or until 4 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers Algorithm 1 Multi-turn Planning and Observation 1: Input: Task instruction 𝑢, maximum steps 𝑇max 2: Output: Final answer answer, execution layers 𝐿, execution trajectory trajectory 3: function MultiturnExecut e(𝑢, 𝑇max) 4: Initialize execution layer list Initialize execution trajectory Get initial state 𝐿 {} trajectory {} 𝑠0 Update(𝑢) for 𝑡 = 0 to 𝑇max do (continue𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) 𝜋plan(𝑠𝑡) 𝑜𝑡 𝜋exec(𝑎𝑡) 𝑜𝑡 𝜋compress(𝑜𝑡) 𝐿 𝐿 {𝑎𝑡} trajectory trajectory {(𝑎𝑡, 𝑜𝑡)} 𝑠𝑡+1 Update(𝑠𝑡, 𝑜𝑡) if continue𝑡 = False then Generate current tool plan Execute tools in the plan Generate compressed summary of the observation Append plan to layer list Log plan and observation Update agent internal state break answer 𝜋final(𝑢, trajectory) return (answer, 𝐿, trajectory) Stop if agent signals termination Produce final answer from trajectory 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: the agent signals to stop. Final reasoning is performed after observing the complete trajectory. The full routine is detailed in Algorithm 1. In line 4-6, we initialize the execution layer list 𝐿, the execution trajectory trajectory, and the initial agent state 𝑠0 from the task instruction 𝑢. In line 7-13, we iteratively plan and execute actions: the planning policy 𝜋plan produces the current tool plan, the execution policy 𝜋exec performs the planned actions, and the compression policy 𝜋compress generates concise summary of the observation. This compression step is crucial because some tools return very long outputs, and summarizing them prevents excessive context windows. The plan is appended to 𝐿, the compressed observation is logged into trajectory, and the agent state is updated. In line 14-15, we check the termination signal continue and stop early if it is False. In line 16-17, the final answer is generated from the complete execution trajectory via 𝜋final. The prompt used for the agent execution can be found in Section A.2. 3.2. Important Capabilities for Tool-Using LLM Agents and How MCP-Bench Reflects Them To perform effectively in tool-augmented environments, LLM agents should demonstrate several critical capabilities beyond standard language modeling. Tool Schema Understanding and Compliance. Agents must faithfully interpret and satisfy complex invocation schemas that involve nested JSON structures, enumerated types, constrained value ranges, and mixtures of required and optional arguments. Success requires aligning natural language reasoning with precise formal specifications. MCP-Bench enforces strict schema validation across 250 tools of varying complexityfrom simple scalar inputs to deeply nested hierarchical structuresensuring that even subtle schema violations are detected. Illustrative examples of diverse input schemas are provided in Section A.5. Tool Retrieval and Selection under Fuzzy Instructions. Agents must identify the correct tools from large, heterogeneous tool spaces when confronted with ambiguous or underspecified task descriptions. This requires disambiguating semantic variants, coping with naming inconsistencies, and avoiding traps posed by superficially plausible but irrelevant tools. MCP-Bench stress-tests retrieval precision by attaching 10 distractor servers to every task, introducing 100+ additional tools per instance. Moreover, 5 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers (a) Category distribution of MCP servers. (b) Tool distribution across servers. Figure 2 Overview of MCP server ecosystem used in the MCP-Bench. fuzzy task variants (Section 4.2) deliberately omit explicit tool names and steps, forcing agents to infer appropriate tools purely from contextual cues. Long-Horizon Planning and Cross-Server Orchestration with Massive Goals. Realistic applications demand multi-round workflows that span domains, maintain interdependent states across rounds, and sometimes pursue multiple goals simultaneously. Agents must manage sequential and parallel dependencies, coordinate heterogeneous outputs, and optimize efficiency through judicious orchestration. MCP-Bench includes both single-server and multi-server tasks with up to 20 execution rounds. Its evaluation framework explicitly measures structural coherence, dependency awareness, parallelism efficiency, and reflective adaptation (Section 5). Tasks include not only linear workflows but also complex compositions requiring concurrent interactions across multiple servers with multiple objectives. Information Grounding and Evidence-Based Reasoning. To avoid hallucination, agents must ground responses in actual tool outputs, maintain factual consistency across calls, and provide traceable evidence for their claims. MCP-Bench evaluates grounding by coupling execution history with rubric-based LLM judgments, rewarding answers that correctly cite tool outputs and penalizing unsupported reasoning (Section 5). Real-World Adaptability. Finally, agents must leverage broad world knowledge to interpret domainspecific semantics, robustly handle diverse tool behaviors, and synthesize heterogeneous outputs into coherent solutions. MCP-Bench spans 28 production-grade MCP servers covering domains from finance and healthcare to scientific computation and cultural heritage, ensuring that tasks reflect the diversity and unpredictability of real-world tool use. 4. MCP-Bench Construction 4.1. MCP Server Collection Our benchmark covers 28 representative MCP servers spanning eleven functional domains (Figure 2a). The largest categories are Media & Entertainment and Research & Knowledge (each 14.3%), followed by Finance, Science, and Software Development (each 10.7%). Smaller shares include Geography & Travel, Social & Intelligence, Mathematics, and Health (7.1% each), with niche domains such as Weather, Time, and Divination (3.6% each). In total, these servers provide 250 tools. Tool counts vary widely (Figure 2b), from single-tool servers (e.g., Call for Papers, FruityVice, Movie Recommender) to large multi-tool platforms such as BioMCP (35 tools), Scientific Computing (26 tools), and Medical Calculator (22 tools). This diverse ecosystem spans scientific computation, finance, 6 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers content discovery, geospatial services, and specialized analytical utilities, ensuring broad capability coverage in PBe nc h. Details of the involved MCP servers and the descriptions of all tools can be found in Table 8. 4.2. Task Synthesis challenge in building tool-using agent benchmarks lies in transforming collection of real-world MCP servers into high-quality tasks with realistic natural language descriptions. Given tools spread across different servers, how can we construct meaningful, solvable, structurally grounded, but challenging tasks at scale? We decompose this challenge into three key stages: dependency chain discovery, automatic quality filtering, and task description fuzzing. Examples of synthesized tasks can be found in Table 2 and Table 9. Besides the task synthesis pipeline, the tasks in MCP-Bench also undergo human inspection to ensure their realism, executability, and the reasonability of the dependency chain analysis. We use o4-mini (OpenAI, 2025c) as the task synthesis LLM. All prompts used can be found in Section A.3. In total, we synthesized 56 tasks with single server, 30 with 2 servers, and 18 with 3 servers. The single-server tasks span all servers in our benchmark. The two-server and three-server combinations for multi-server setting are listed in Table 10. Dependency Chain Discovery and Task Generation. We start the task synthesis by analyzing dependency chains among the provided tools: sequences where each tools outputs naturally flow into the next tools inputs. These chains serve as structural scaffolds for task generation. We analyze both inherent dependencies arising from natural tool relationships and scenario-based dependencies constructed for meaningful workflows. For multi-server configurations, we emphasize cross-server dependencies to ensure genuine tool coordination across different data sources. This yields diverse structural patterns including linear workflows, parallel execution groups, and hybrid compositions. The task synthesis LLM are then asked to generate tasks based on the analysis results for dependency chains (see prompts in Section A.3). Also, the analysis results for the dependency chains are used in the evaluation phase as the reference for the LLM judge (see Section A.4). Automatic Quality Filtering. Each generated task undergoes rigorous two-dimensional quality evaluation: Solvability: Whether the task can be completed using available tools. Practical utility: Whether the task addresses genuine user needs rather than contrived scenarios. Tasks failing the quality threshold (solvability: 9.0/10, utility: 5.0/10) are disgarded (see details in Section A.3). This ensures only high-quality tasks that meet our standards enter the final benchmark, maintaining benchmark integrity at the cost of reduced quantity. Task Description Fuzzing. For tasks that pass quality filtering, the algorithm generates fuzzy task variants that state high-level goals without explicit operational details. These fuzzy descriptions transform structured instructions into natural business requests, requiring agents to infer appropriate tool sequences and execution strategies from the available dependency structures. For domains requiring precise inputs (e.g., scientific computation, unit conversion), the fuzzy variants critically preserve all numerical values and concrete parameters while adopting conversational language. This ensures tasks remain mathematically solvable while testing the agents ability to bridge the gap between user intent and technical execution. Detailed prompt used for task description fuzzing can be found in Section A.3. 5. Evaluation Method and Metrics We use comprehensive evaluation framework combining rule-based metrics and LLM judge scoring. The rule-based component measures tool usage robustness across four dimensionsname validity, schema adherence, runtime success, and dependency compliancefrom execution traces. The LLM-as-aMCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers Judge component assesses strategic quality in task completion, tool selection, and planning efficiency and effectiveness, using structured rubrics with prompt shuffling and score averaging to ensure fairness. 5.1. Rule-based Evaluation To assess the schema understanding and execution robustness of an agents behavior, we evaluate its tool usage along dimensions of name validity, input schema adherence, and runtime success. Let 𝐸 = {𝑒1, . . . , 𝑒𝑘} be the set of all tool invocations during execution. Tool Name Validity Rate. This metric assesses whether the agent selects tools that exist within the allowed set Tavailable: 𝑅valid = {𝑒 𝐸:tool(𝑒) Tavailable } , where tool(𝑒) returns the identifier of the tool invoked in event 𝑒. This metric penalizes hallucinations or invalid tool references and reflects the agents grounding in tool availability. 𝐸 Schema Compliance Rate. This metric measures whether each tool invocation provides correctly structured parameters that match the tools expected input schema: 𝐶schema = {𝑒 𝐸:valid_tool(𝑒)valid_schema(𝑒) } , where valid_tool(𝑒) is Boolean function returning True if tool(𝑒) Tavailable, and valid_schema(𝑒) returns True if the parameters in event 𝑒 match the expected input schema of the tool. This ensures the agent understands the expected API argument formats and avoids malformed requests. {𝑒 𝐸:valid_tool(𝑒) } Execution Success Rate. This metric quantifies the proportion of tool invocations that successfully return results without runtime failure: 𝑅success = {𝑒 𝐸:success(𝑒) } , where success(𝑒) returns True if the tool call in event 𝑒 is executed without runtime errors and produces valid result. high success rate indicates robust interaction with external systems and proper error handling. 𝐸 5.2. LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation To further assess the strategic quality of agent behavior beyond raw execution correctness, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge framework. The evaluator is prompted to score agent performance across three core axes: task completion quality, tool selection/usage rationale, and planning effectiveness. Evaluations are grounded solely in observable evidence from the task definition, final solution, and execution trace. By default, the judge model used here is o4-mini (OpenAI, 2025c). Rubrics-based Judge Prompt. The LLM judge is provided with the fuzzy task description given to the execution agent, the concrete task description before fuzzing (not provided to the agent being evaluated; see Section 4.2), the dependency analysis (not provided to the agent being evaluated; see Section 4.2), the agents final solution, the total number of execution rounds, summarized execution trace, and the list of available tools. It is explicitly instructed to remain impartial and evidence-driven, and to assign scores strictly based on proportional success. Scoring follows structured rubric that decomposes each evaluation axis into multiple sub-dimensions (detailed in Section A.4). It assigns scores based on structured rubric that breaks down each evaluation axis into multiple sub-dimensions (detailed in Section A.4). Each sub-dimension is rated on scale from 1 to 10. The average score across the sub-dimensions yields the overall score for that axis, which is then normalized to the [0, 1] range for benchmarking. Task Completion Quality assesses whether the agent delivers correct, complete, and evidence-based solution. This includes evaluating how well the task goal is fulfilled (task fulfillment), whether all necessary subtasks are covered and supported by evidence (information grounding), and whether the response remains relevant and focused. Tool Usage Quality evaluates the agents effectiveness in employing tools. Sub-dimensions include 8 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers suitability of chosen tools for each subtask (tool appropriateness) and the correctness and completeness of parameters provided to these tools (parameter accuracy). Planning Effectiveness assesses the coherence and efficiency of multi-round execution. This includes whether inter-tool constraints are respected (dependency awareness) and whether the agent minimizes redundancy and exploits opportunities for parallel execution (parallelism and efficiency). Prompt Shuffling and Score Averaging. Li et al. (2025) has shown that LLM judge can exhibit sensitivity to the ordering of rubric dimensions. To mitigate this issue, we adopt prompt shuffling strategy that randomly permutes the order of major evaluation axes (e.g., Task Completion, Tool Selection, Planning Efficiency) as well as the sub-dimensions within each axis. Importantly, while the ordering is shuffled, the semantic content and phrasing of the rubrics remain unchanged to ensure fairness and consistency. By default, we perform five independent shufflings of the rubric prompt for each task instance. Each shuffled prompt is submitted separately to the LLM judge, resulting in five sets of rubric-based scores. For each scoring run, we first average the sub-dimension scores within each axis and normalize them to the [0, 1] range. The final judgment score for the task is then computed as the average of the five independently obtained axis-level scores. This randomized multi-pass evaluation strategy substantially reduces the likelihood that evaluation outcomes are biased by prompt structure, and enhances the robustness and fairness of the LLM-based judgment process. Empirical results (Section 6.4) show that this method lowers score variance, leading to more reliable and stable assessments. 6. Benchmark Results 6.1.

(2025), gpt-oss-20b (OpenAI, 2025b), qwen3-30b-a3binstruct-2507 (Yang et al., 2025), gpt-oss-120b (OpenAI, 2025b), glm-4.5 (Zeng et al., 2025), qwen3235b-a22b-2507 (Yang et al., 2025), claude-sonnet-4 (Anthropic, 2025), gemini-2.5-pro Comanici et al. (2025), o3 (OpenAI, 2025c), and gpt-5 (OpenAI, 2025a). Table 3 reports results averaged across settings with single server and multiple servers. We find that schema understanding capabilities remain consistently high for strong models, with o3, gpt-5, gpt-oss-120b, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, and gpt-4o all surpassing 98% in schema compliance and valid tool naming. However, substantial differences emerge in higher-level reasoning. The strongest modelsgpt-5 (0.749), o3 (0.715), and gpt-oss-120b (0.692)achieve the highest overall scores, reflecting both accurate tool use and robust planning effectiveness. By contrast, smaller models such as llama-3-1-8b-instruct (0.428) lag behind, showing weaker performance in dependency awareness and parallelism despite adequate execution success. These results highlight that while basic execution has largely converged, planning and reasoning capabilities remain the key differentiators among models. Table 4 and Table 5 provide detailed comparison between singleand multi-server settings. We see that weaker models degrade noticeably once the number of servers increases. For example, llama-3-1-8b-instruct falls from an overall score of 0.438 in the single-server case to 0.415 with multiple servers, while nova-micro-v1 drops from 0.520 to 0.471. The main sources of decline lie in dependency awareness and parallelism, which become harder to sustain in distributed workflows. Interestingly, the drop is not always smoothperformance fluctuates across different server counts, suggesting that the mix of sequential dependencies and parallel orchestration stresses models in MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers Table 3 Leaderboard on MCP-Benc h, i.e., results of different models, averaged across settings with single server and multiple servers.

These results underline that execution quality alone is no longer the bottleneckthe real differentiator is robustness to scaling, where top-tier models demonstrate clear advantages in handling long-horizon, cross-server tasks. 6.2. Agent Performance on Different Capabilities and Insights from MC P-Bench Score on Different Capabilities. Table 4 and Table 5 also provide fine-grained breakdown of performance across six evaluation axes: task fulfillment, information grounding, tool appropriateness, parameter accuracy, dependency awareness, and parallelism efficiency. On task completion, frontier models such as gpt-5, o3, and gpt-oss-120b achieve the strongest results, exceeding 0.63 in fulfillment and 0.70 in grounding, whereas smaller systems like llama-3-1-8b-instruct and nova-micro-v1 remain below 0.35 and 0.45 respectively, reflecting weaker semantic consistency. In tool selection, top-tier models again dominate: gpt-5, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro maintain appropriateness and parameter accuracy around or above 0.70, while weaker baselines plateau closer to 0.300.50. The sharpest disparities appear in planning effectiveness. gpt-5 sustains the highest dependency awareness (0.76) with competitive parallelism efficiency (0.34), closely followed by o3 (0.69 and 0.37) and qwen3235b-a22b-2507 (0.54 and 0.31). By contrast, smaller models rarely exceed 0.30 on either dimension, underscoring planning as the most significant frontier capability that separates state-of-the-art agents from weaker baselines. Insights from MCP-Bench. The combined evidence from Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5 yields several insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLM agents: Schema understanding convergence. Low-level capabilities such as schema compliance and valid tool naming have largely converged across models. Even mid-scale systems achieve accuracy above 95%, suggesting that basic execution fidelity is no longer the primary bottleneck. Scalability under multi-server settings. As the number of servers increases, task complexity rises, but the performance curves are not strictly monotonic. Strong models (e.g., o3, gpt-5) maintain relatively stable scores across singleand multi-server settings, while weaker/small models (e.g., llama-3-1-70b-instruct) show clear degradation with occasional fluctuations. This indicates that adaptation in multi-server scenario is differentiating capability.

The largest separations appear in planning effectiveness. Top models demonstrate coherent structural reasoning, dependency awareness, and adaptive reflection, reaching around 0.72 on these sub-dimensions, whereas weaker models rarely exceed 0.30. This highlights that long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop coordination remain open challenges. Together, these results show that while modern LLMs have mastered execution fidelity, their ability to generalize to complex, adaptive, cross-server workflows is still limited. MCP-Bench exposes this gap systematically, providing rigorous benchmark for advancing agentic LLM capabilities. 6.3. Number of Rounds and Tool Calls for Different Models Executing Tasks Table 6 reports the average number of interaction rounds and tool calls required for different models to complete tasks in MCP-Bench. The results highlight both the complexity of the benchmark and the efficiency differences across models. Tasks in MCP-Bench are inherently multi-step and often involve chaining heterogeneous tools across servers, requiring both sequential reasoning and parallel orchestration. As result, even strong models typically require several rounds of interaction and 11 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers Table 6 Average rounds and tool calls per task on different models."

Ablation Studies on LLM Judge Pipeline To assess the effectiveness of prompt shuffling and score averaging in our LLM judge pipeline, we conduct ablation study on it in this section. Coefficient of Variation among Different LLMs. To quantify the stability of LLM judge under different pipeline designs, we compute the coefficient of variation (CV) for each judge pipeline across suite of 50 benchmark tasks. These tasks are automatically synthesized using two real-world Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers: WebSearch1 and Time2. The WebSearch server supports information retrieval and summarization, while the Time server provides temporal reasoning and calendar tools. Each task is scored by three LLMso4-mini (OpenAI, 2025c), gpt-4o (Hurst et al., 2024), gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024),with same LLM judge pipeline. We extract the task completion score (on 010 scale) for CV computation. Specifically, for each task 𝑡, we calculate its coefficient of 1https://github.com/mnhlt/WebSearch-MCP 2https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time 12 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers 100%, where 𝜇𝑡 = 1 𝑘 variation as CV𝑡 = 𝜎𝑡 𝑗=1(𝑠 𝑗 𝜇𝑡)2, with 𝑠 𝑗 denoting the 𝜇𝑡 task completion score assigned by model 𝑗, and 𝑘 the number of models. The final reported CV is the mean over all tasks: CV = 1 𝑡=1 CV𝑡, where 𝑛 = 50 is the number of benchmark tasks. As shown 𝑛 in Table 1, removing prompt shuffling and score averaging results in CV of 16.8%, while enabling them reduces the CV to 15.1%, indicating improved consistency across LLMs. 𝑠 𝑗 and 𝜎𝑡 = (cid:205)𝑛 (cid:205)𝑘 (cid:205)𝑘 𝑗=1 1 𝑘 Human Agreement Score. We further evaluate the alignment between LLM judges and human preferences. Three human annotators independently reviewed score in different dimensions produced by each judge pipeline and rated their agreement on 3-point scale: 0 for disagreement, 1 for partial agreement, and 2 for full agreement. The final human agreement score is the average across all annotators and tasks. As shown in Table 7, the pipeline without prompt shuffling and score averaging achieves an average agreement of 1.24 out of 2, while the pipeline with prompt perturbation improves this score to 1.43, demonstrating that strategy also impacts human-perceived evaluation quality. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we introduced MCP-Bench, large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic, ecosystem-based tool-use scenarios. Built on MCP, MCP-Bench connects agents to 28 production servers with 250 tools, enabling complex multi-hop workflows and cross-domain orchestration. Our automated task synthesis pipeline generates 104 challenging tasks with fuzzy instructions that require strong agentic capabilities to solve. Through our evaluation framework combining rule-based checks and LLM Judge scoring, we revealed that even state-of-the-art models struggle with different capabilities such as dependency chain compliance, tool selection under noisy environment, and long-horizon planning. 13 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers"

PERCENTAGE-BASED SCORING SYSTEM: How to Calculate Scores: For each dimension, calculate the DEFECT RATE: Defect Rate = (Number of Issues / Total Opportunities) 100% Then map defect rate to score: 010% defects Score 910 (Excellent to Perfect) 1030% defects Score 79 (Good performance) 3050% defects Score 57 (Average performance) 5070% defects Score 35 (Poor performance) 70100% defects Score 03 (Failed) How to Score: 1. When evaluating percentages, be EXTREMELY STRICT about what counts as perfectly executed 2. Perfectly means ALL of the following must be true: Correct tool selection (not just works but OPTIMAL choice) 39 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers Complete and accurate parameters (not just valid, but IDEAL) Zero redundancy (no repeated or unnecessary calls) Proper error handling (graceful recovery from ANY failure) Efficient execution (parallel when possible, minimal rounds) Concise output (no verbose explanations unless requested) 3. If ANY of the above is missing, that portion is NOT perfectly executed (counts as 0%) 4. Example: Task completed correctly but with 1 redundant call = that portion is 0% perfect KEY PRINCIPLES: 1. ALWAYS calculate as percentage, NOT absolute numbers 2. 10 errors in 100 calls (10%) = same score as 1 error in 10 calls (10%) 3. Consider the OPPORTUNITY COUNT for each dimension: Tool calls: How many total calls were made? Parallelization: How many tasks COULD have been parallel? Parameters: How many total parameters across all calls? Claims: How many factual statements were made? Dependencies: How many dependency relationships exist? 4. NORMALIZE by complexity - dont punish complex tasks: Simple task: 1 error/5 steps (20% defect) = Score 7 Complex task: 4 errors/20 steps (20% defect) = Score 7 CRITICAL: Apply the STRICTEST interpretation of perfectly executed. If theres ANY doubt, score lower. CONCRETE SCORING EXAMPLES WITH PROPORTIONS: Task Fulfillment: Completed 19/20 requirements (5% defect rate) = Score 9 Completed 16/20 requirements (20% defect rate) = Score 8 Completed 12/20 requirements (40% defect rate) = Score 6 Completed 8/20 requirements (60% defect rate) = Score 4 Tool Appropriateness: 19/20 tools optimal (5% defect rate) = Score 9 16/20 tools optimal (20% defect rate) = Score 8 12/20 tools optimal (40% defect rate) = Score 6 8/20 tools optimal (60% defect rate) = Score 4 Parallelism & Efficiency: 9/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (10% missed) = Score 9 8/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (20% missed) = Score 8 6/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (40% missed) = Score 6 4/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (60% missed) = Score 4 Grounding: 19/20 claims supported by evidence (5% unsupported) = Score 9 16/20 claims supported by evidence (20% unsupported) = Score 8 12/20 claims supported by evidence (40% unsupported) = Score 6 8/20 claims supported by evidence (60% unsupported) = Score 4 Parameter Accuracy: 95/100 parameters perfect (5% defect rate) = Score 9 80/100 parameters perfect (20% defect rate) = Score 8 60/100 parameters perfect (40% defect rate) = Score 6 40 MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World Tasks via MCP Servers 40/100 parameters perfect (60% defect rate) = Score 4 FORMAT NOTE: Text output when JSON not required = NO PENALTY (0% defect) FORMAT NOTE: Missing JSON when explicitly required = Count as failed requirement Remember: Most real-world executions should score 46. Scores of 8+ should be EXCEPTIONAL. FINAL REMINDER BEFORE SCORING: Default to 45 unless you have strong evidence for higher Count ONLY truly perfect executions toward the percentage Be your most critical self - find flaws first, then acknowledge successes If youre considering score above 7, re-examine for ANY imperfection Server count is IRRELEVANT - using more servers is NOT better CRITICAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: 1. You MUST map each score to the exact percentage ranges in the rubrics. 2. Task Completion and Tool Selection MUST be evaluated against the CONCRETE TASK REFERENCE, not the fuzzy task. 3. Planning Effectiveness should be evaluated based on the PROPORTION of dependencies correctly handled, not the absolute number of steps executed or exact conformance to the dependency analysis. 4. First calculate the actual percentage of completion/success, then assign the corresponding score range. 5. IMPORTANT: Focus on completion RATIOS not absolute numbers - completing 7/10 steps (70%) should score similarly to completing 14/20 steps (70%), regardless of task complexity. Please score based on COMPLETION PERCENTAGES and PROPORTIONAL SUCCESS, not absolute numbers of tools called or steps executed.

Ive been itching to head out of Denver for 5-day camping trip sometime in the next week, but Im kind of torn on which national park makes the most sense. Ideally its no more than about 200 km drive, offers solid hiking and camping, and has visitor center where can catch any talks or events going on that week. Im also really curious about spending nights at camp spots that vary in elevationmaybe one high ridge, one mid-level meadow and one lower valleyjust to see how the landscape and weather change. On top of that, dont want to be stuck cooking at every stop, so itd be awesome to know what town is nearest each campsite and where can grab good mealnot just any greasy spoon, but something rated at least four stars, and need to know how long the drive is and exactly how to get there. In the middle of the trip Id like to base myself at visitor center for couple of nights to break things up and dive into any ranger-led programs. Could you put together day-by-day itinerary for the upcoming week that does all of thatpicks the best park within reasonable drive from Denver, highlights three campsites that maximize elevation differences, flags any alerts or events happening, finds the nearest town restaurants with ratings and drive times, and then lays out morning/afternoon/evening plans for each of the five days? really need actual data on thiscant go wandering off with just vague advice.

We need Python 3.10, Flask itself, Redis, and Docker all coming from the same Nix channel (were on 25.05), plus config snippets that play nicely with Home Manager on Linux laptops and nix-darwin on macOS. On top of that, my lead wants tiny excerptlike 500 words or soon how Flask routing works to stick in our README. What would really help is if you could pull together: quick snapshot of the 25.05 channel (how big it is, broadly speaking) The exact Nix package names and versions for python3, flask, redis, and docker, ideally with the commit or revision that pins them The main Home Manager options we should set for Python and Docker, with their descriptions The equivalent nix-darwin settings so my mac-using teammate can just drop them in Whether theres Poetry flake out there we can lean on (or note if none exist) And finally, about 500 tokens worth of official Flask routing docs so can paste it straight into our project guide If you could wrap all of that up as single JSON can hand off to my team, thatd save me hours of guessworkand give me the hard data need to prove this setup will actually work everywhere.

Im putting together small art-history spotlight on seating in New Kingdom Egyptspecifically whats on view at the Metand Im bit stuck on how to pull everything together. My professor wants me to pick out an example piece from the Mets Egyptian section, but Im not even sure what they call that department or how to find chairs with pictures in their collection. Once have few candidates, need to know their dates (make sure theyre really New Kingdom) and exactly what theyre made of. If there arent enough chairs, might have to slip in stool or footrest to hit at least two examples, and then choose the one with the most elaborate materials list as my main focus. After that, have to see what Wikipedia says about Ancient Egyptian furnituregrab the article summary, pull out the top five insights specifically about New Kingdom pieces, and boil down the Construction and materials bit into quick blurb. Itd also help to know handful of related topics could mention for extra context. Finally, need to check if my chosen Met object uses any materials that dont show up in those Wikipedia factsthose could be neat anomalies to point out. really need actual Met IDs, image links, periods, materials lists, the Wikipedia summary, key New Kingdom facts, that short construction/materials paragraph, related topics, and note on any unmatched materials.

After that, Id like to get its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, figure out the largest and smallest eigenvalue, and compute the condition number. If it turns out to be over 100, Ill need to go the SVD route and build pseudoinverse; otherwise regular inverse should do.
