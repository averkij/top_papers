Humans naturally turn",
            "content": "toward their conversational partners, shift posture as they move, and modulate gaze to signal engagement. Moreover, comfort in levels of eye contact vary widelyshaped by personal preference, social context, and cultural norms. For virtual agents to replicate this behavior and appear humanlike, their motion must be both spatially aware and controllableorienting toward the user while adapting gaze to individual preferences. Current methods, however, focus on conversational contexts in isolation, producing agents that lack situated reasoning. We present method for generating full-body motion for virtual agent that responds to both the conversation and the users spatial movementall in real-time. Achieving such motion requires satisfying four criteria simultaneously. First, it must be conversationally appropriategestures should align naturally with speech. Second, it must be spatially awarethe agent should orient toward and react to the users movement. Third, it must be controllablegaze engagement should be adjustable to suit different contexts and preferences. Fourth, it must be real-timegeneration must be causal and streaming, with no access to future information. Achieving all four remains an open challenge: state-of-the-art methods either ignore spatial context, require non-causal access to future frames, or run far below real-time speeds. We present the first method to close this gap. Existing gesture generation methods are predominantly monadic: they synthesize motion for single speaker conditioned on audio or text, with no awareness of an interlocutor [Alexanderson et al. 2023; Nyatsanga et al. 2023; Yi et al. 2023]. The few dyadic methods that exist typically assume stationary, forward-facing participantsmimicking video calls rather than dynamic, in-person interactions [Ng et al. 2022, 2024]. Moreover, popular state-ofthe-art generative models are often too slow for real-time deployment [Ng et al. 2022, 2024] or require non-causal access to future arXiv, 2026, Ng et al. frames [Alexanderson et al. 2023], precluding streaming inference. Compounding this, existing dyadic datasets lack the spatial dynamics needed to learn reactive behavior. As result, generated agents remain stationary and rigidly face one anotherlacking the fluid spatial dynamics of real conversation. Our key insight is to decouple learning from control: we learn the natural distribution of spatial alignment from data, capturing gaze behaviors from sustained eye contact to deliberate aversion, then apply lightweight guidance mechanism at inference to calibrate orientation based on user preference. This separation allows the model to generate motion that is both naturalistic (drawn from the learned distribution) and controllable (steered toward desired gaze intensity). To achieve this, we propose real-time, causal architecture built on two core components. First, causal transformer-based VAE compresses motion into temporally-strided latent sequence, with interleaved latent tokens enabling streaming inference without sacrificing temporal coherence. Second, flow matching model generates motion in this latent space, conditioned on the users trajectory and both speakers audio. For fine-grained control, we introduce gaze guidance mechanism based on classifier-free guidance, allowing users to modulate eye contact intensity at inference. Underpinning these components is fully Euclidean motion representation that improves training stability and enables precise end-effector control. We evaluate on the Embody 3D dataset [McLean et al. 2025], the first to capture realistic proxemics in dynamic spatial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality while running at over 300 FPS, outperforming non-causal baselines (MDM, A2P) that are 3 slower. Notably, we match the gaze alignment of non-causal methods without access to future user positions, demonstrating that reactive spatial behavior can be learned causally. The generated motion is also controllable: users can modulate eye contact intensity at inference to suit their preferences. We deploy on real-time avatar system, confirming viability for production. In summary, we present the first real-time system for spatiallyaware conversational motion, enabling virtual agents to participate in dynamic interactions. Our approach combines causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference, Euclidean surface-point representation for stable training and precise end-effector control, and classifier-free gaze guidance mechanism for user-adjustable eye contact. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Embody 3D dataset [McLean et al. 2025] and successfully deploy our method on real-time avatar system."

To enable controllable gaze at inference, we compute gaze score 𝑔, where d𝑥 is the agents facing direction and d𝑦 points toward the user (right). The score approaches 1 when facing the user directly and 1 when facing away. We encode gaze based on head orientation relative to user position  (Fig. 4)  . Let ℎ𝑓 , ℎ𝑏 R3 denote the front and back of the agents head. We define the agents facing direction as: 𝑑𝑥 = ℎ𝑓 ℎ𝑏 ℎ𝑓 ℎ𝑏 , and the direction toward the user as: 𝑑𝑦 = 𝑝𝑦 ℎ𝑏 𝑝𝑦 ℎ𝑏 , (6) (7) The gaze score is then the dot product between these unit vectors: 𝑔 = 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑦 .

            "content": "Implementation Details. We train our model and run all experiments on an A100 GPU. For all experiments, we set the sequence length 𝑇 = 400. Videos are sampled at 30 fps while the audio is sampled at 48kHz. For the motion representation, we use MHR [Ferguson et al. 2025] which allows us to render photorealistic avatars. For our VAE, we stride of 𝑠 = 4, and the encoder and decoder each have 9 layers with 4 attention heads and hidden dimension of 256. We set 𝛽 = 1𝑒 4 for the KL loss. For the flow matching model, we encode each modality using learned positional encoding before concatenating them along the channel dimension. We then use rope for temporal positional encoding. To incorporate the noise timestep, we use AdaLNZero. We use 4 transformer layers with 4 attention heads and hidden dimension of 1024. We train with local batch size of 16 across 8 gpus. During inference, we use cfg of 1.3 to control the conditioning strength. Since not all methods are autoregressive or causal, we calculate the methods fps by generating all 400 frames in one go and then dividing the total time taken by 400. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate motion along five axes: (1) FGD (Fréchet Gesture Distance), which measures distributional similarity between generated and ground-truth poses via the Fréchet distance over the vertex positions of the mesh; (2) FGDacc, the same metric computed on acceleration to assess motion smoothness and dynamics; (3) Foot Slide, the fraction of frames where feet are near the ground (<5 cm) yet moving horizontally (>3 cm/s), indicating skating artifacts; (4) Wrist Var, the average wrist velocity measuring gesture expressiveness; and (5) Head Ang., the mean dot product between the agents facing direction and the vector toward the user, quantifying gaze alignment (1 = facing user, 1 = facing away). We classify each clip as speaking (S) or non-speaking (NS) based on the agents audio energy, and report both an overall average and separate S/NS values for each metric to enable analysis across conversational contexts. For most metrics, the average reflects weighted mean of the and NS values. However, for FGD and FGDacc, the computation differs: the Avg column reports the mean of per-batch Fréchet distances, whereas the and NS values are each computed by first pooling all clips of that category across all batches, then measuring single Fréchet distance on the pooled distribution. This pooling is necessary because individual batches may contain too few clips of one category for reliable covariance estimation. As consequence, the per-batch averages systematically exceed the pooled S/NS values due to small-sample-size bias in covariance estimation, and the Avg is not simple weighted combination of and NS. Note that FGDacc is substantially higher for speaking clips than non-speaking clips, reflecting increased gestural dynamics during speech. Baselines and Ablations. Since no prior work addresses realtime, spatially-aware conversational motion generation, we cannot directly compare against existing methods. To ensure fair comparison, we retrain all prior works on our dataset and motion representation (Sec. 3.1). We deliberately select foundational architecturesdiffusion-based, VQ-based, and hybrid methodsthat underpin many recent state-of-the-art systems, rather than taskspecific variants with additional modules (e.g., text encoders or domain-specific losses). This ensures fair comparison of core generative capabilities. We compare against: Random: Randomly samples motion sequence from the training set, providing lower bound on performance. NN: nearest-neighbor retrieval baseline that selects motion based on the conditioning inputs. For audio matching, we use HuBERT embeddings. We use library of 2048 motion sequences randomly sampled from the training set and match across the full clip rather than via sliding windows, which yielded better temporal coherence and overall performance. MDM [Tevet et al. 2022]: diffusion-based model originally designed for text-conditioned motion generation that has since become foundation for many subsequent methods that have extended it to support various conditioning signals. We adapt MDM to use the same conditioning inputs for our domain: agent audio, user audio, and user head trajectory. It operates non-causally and does not run in real-time. A2P [Ng et al. 2024]: hybrid approach combining VQ-based discrete representations with diffusion-based refinement. It operates autoregressively but is not real-time due to its multistage pipeline. SHOW [Yi et al. 2023]: VQ-based autoregressive model designed to generate upper-body, conversational 3D motion from speech. It employs separate VQ-VAEs for arm and hand movements, followed by an autoregressive generator for full upper-body motion. With minimal modification to the original architecture, we condition SHOW on agent audio alone to evaluate how existing audio-only methods perform in spatially-aware settings. We also run ablation studies to isolate two key design choices: our motion representation and latent compression via the VAE. Ours in Joint Space (IK): Instead of our Euclidean representation (Sec. 3.1), we encode traditional joint angles with the VAE. Mesh positions are then recovered via inverse kinematics. Ours w/o VAE: We remove the causal VAE, directly predicting Euclidean positions from the transformer. arXiv, 2026, Ng et al.

The retrieval baselines achieve the lowest FGD scores (Random: 1.06, NN: 0.90) since they sample directly from the true data distributionoutperforming Ours (1.28) on this metric alone. However, this advantage is superficial: retrieval methods cannot jointly satisfy all criteria. Randoms gaze alignment score (0.28) is catastrophic compared to Ours (0.83) since randomly sampled motion bears no relation to user position. NN addresses this by jointly matching audio features (HuBERT embeddings) and user position, improving the gaze alignment to 0.59.

While both retrieval methods achieve near-zero foot sliding (0.01) by copying real motion (matching Ours), their wrist variance reveals further limitations: Random (188.1) overshoots GT (137.6) due to context-agnostic sampling, while NN (97.0) undershoots as retrieval favors common, less expressive clips. Ours (105.0) strikes better balance. These results highlight key distinction: while retrieval achieves strong distributional metrics by construction, it is fundamentally limited to what exists in the dataset. Ours instead generates novel motion that jointly optimizes for all criteriaachieving competitive FGD (1.28) while dramatically improving spatial awareness (0.83 vs. NNs 0.59). Generative baselines. To evaluate against non-real-time state-ofthe-art in the dyadic (two-person) setting, we adapt MDM and A2P to use the same user-aware conditioning as Ours: agent audio, user audio, and user head trajectory. When naively adapted to our domain, MDM achieves the worst FGD (3.48) among all methods. Analysis reveals that MDM produces over-smoothed motion: its wrist variance (61.4) is only 45% of GT (137.6), indicating severely dampened gestures. This likely reflects an architecture mismatch: MDM was designed for text-to-motion with coarse action descriptions, not fine-grained audio-gesture synchronization and may favor global motion coherence over local dynamics. MDM appropriately matches the ground truth gaze alignment (0.81) perfectlyperhaps due to its non-causal architecture having access to future user positions to allow it to preemptively react accordingly. In contrast, Ours achieves similar gaze alignment (0.83) while operating causally, demonstrating that gaze alignment can be learned without requiring future information. MDM also exhibits significant foot sliding (0.11), suggesting that diffusion directly over the euclidean representation actually struggles to maintain physical constraints without learned latent prior. A2P extends MDM with an additional VQ-based stage: discrete tokens are first generated autoregressively, then refined via diffusion. This two-stage approach reduces FGD and foot sliding compared to MDM. However, A2P still falls short of Ours across all metrics: higher FGD (2.01 vs. 1.28), lower wrist variance (69.4 vs. 105.0), and weaker gaze alignment (0.71 vs. 0.83). Qualitatively, we find that A2Ps coarse VQ keyframes can lag temporally, forcing the diffusion stage to correct for misaligned targets. This results in dampened gestures (lower wrist variance) and temporally offset gaze (lower gaze alignment). Both diffusion methods also run at only 90 FPS3 slower than Oursand their reliance on future context prevents deployment in streaming applications. Unlike the diffusion methods, SHOW operates causally at 230 FPS, making it the most architecturally comparable baseline to Ours. We evaluate it without user conditioning to serve as monadic (single-agent) baseline. However, SHOW struggles even in its original domainsuggesting fundamental architectural limitations even without user conditioning. On foot sliding, the gap is stark: SHOW (0.27) is 27 worse than Ours (0.01), likely due to its separate SARAH: Spatially Aware Real-time Agentic Humans arXiv, 2026,"

Figure 5: We visualize the agents facing direction via projected lines (agent: yellow red; user: blue green). With no alignment 𝑔 = , the agents gaze is more diverse; as we increase 𝑔, the agent increasingly turns towards the user. VQ-VAEs for arms and handsoriginally designed for upper-body motionwhich lack body-ground coordination when extended to full-body generation. On expressiveness, SHOWs wrist variance (65.0) falls well below Ours (105.0). Qualitatively, SHOW produces sweeping gestures but struggles with the rapid, fine-grained motion important for expressive speechdynamics that Ours captures through its flow-based formulation. As expected, the largest gap is in spatial awareness: SHOWs gaze alignment (0.61) falls well below Ours (0.83). This highlights key limitation of audio-only conditioningthe audio signal does not encode user position, so the model cannot learn appropriate orientation. Ours addresses this directly through explicit user conditioning, enabling spatially-aware generation. Ablations. We isolate the contributions of key design choices. Ours in Joint Space (IK) replaces our Euclidean surface-point representation with traditional joint angles, requiring inverse kinematics to recover mesh positions. core issue is that joint-angle predictions face inherent ambiguitymultiple configurations can produce similar end-effector positions. This directly impacts metrics that depend on precise positioning: gaze alignment drops from 0.83 to 0.72 (head orientation), and foot sliding increases from 0.01 to 0.03 (foot-ground contact). The ambiguity may also encourage conservative predictions, which is reflected in wrist variance decreasing from 105.0 to 87.1the model produces less expressive motion when end-effector targets are uncertain. These results motivate our Euclidean surface-point approach, which directly specifies end-effector positions without ambiguity. Ours w/o VAE removes the causal VAE, directly predicting motion from the transformer. Without the VAEs learned latent structure, the model must predict high-dimensional motion directly, making it harder to capture the true motion distributionFGD rises from 1.28 to 1.95. However, physical plausibility metrics remain stable: foot sliding stays at 0.01 and wrist variance (96.9) remains comparable to Ours (105.0). This indicates that the VAEs primary benefit is distributionalmatching the motion manifoldrather than enforcing physical constraints, which our Euclidean representation seems to handle. Inference speed also halves (300 to 150 FPS), as predicting in the compressed latent space is more efficient than directly generating high-dimensional motion. arXiv, 2026, Ng et al.

DartControl: diffusion-based autoregressive motion model for real-time text-driven motion control. arXiv preprint arXiv, 2026, Ng et al. A.2 Training Details We provide additional training hyperparameters and details not included in the main text. Optimization. We use the AdamW optimizer with 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999, and weight decay 1 104. The learning rate follows linear warmup over the first 1,000 training steps, peaking at 1 104. The VAE is trained for 200K iterations before freezing, after which the flow matching model is trained for an additional 300K iterations. Data Processing. We use 80/10/10 split for training/validation/test. During training, we randomly sample full sequence from the training set and from there, randomly sample subsequence of length 𝑇 = 400 frames. For test time, we use sliding window of length 𝑇 = 400 and no overlap. We evaluate across the full set and generate 2048 sequences in total. For audio features, we use HuBERT-Large, which is not fully causal. So at training time, we essentially do have some information leakage. In order to ensure that it is fully causal at test time, we implement the streaming logic such that we never pass into HuBERT any future frames to avoid this leakage. Instead, we always implement sliding window logic where we pass in the current context and then the previous 𝑇 𝑠 frames. We find that shifting to this fully causal approach at test time does not degrade performance. Latent Dimension. The VAE latent dimension is 𝐷𝑧 = 256. With stride 𝑠 = 4 and sequence length 𝑇 = 400, this produces 𝐾 = 100 latent tokens per sequence. A.3 Inference Details Streaming Protocol. For real-time deployment, we generate motion in chunks of 𝑠 = 4 frames. We then keep the last 2 tokens and then remove all the prior ones. In essence, we generate total of 8 frames at time. As discussed in the main text (), we inpaint the history frames to maintain temporal consistency. For each chunk, we run using midpoint solver with 4 iterations (8 nfe steps). In this setting, we are able to achieve 60 fps at test time, which allows us to achieve real-time streaming performance. Photorealistic Rendering. We follow [Bagautdinov et al. 2021], learning based method, to render photorealistic avatars from the generated joint parameter motions. The model takes as input one frame of facial expression, one frame of body pose, and viewpoint direction. We use an off the shelf method to generate facial expression parameters from speech audio. The model then outputs registered geometry and view dependent texture, which is used to synthesize images via rasterization.

Supplementary Material A.1 Video Results Please refer to 5 minute video for this section. We start with the problem setup (00:00 00:45) for dyadic conversation between user and an agent. Given the users 3D position and dyadic audio (from both user and agent), our goal is to generate spatially-aware 3D motion for the agent that aligns with the conversation and moves according to the users 3D position. From the generated motion, we can then render photorealistic avatar. Our model is lightweight and fast enough to enable streaming, allowing real-time interaction with the AI agent on VR platforms. The streamed results (00:46 01:25) demonstrate that our model produces conversationally-appropriate gestures while naturally turning toward the user to signal social engagement. The agent seamlessly transitions between speaking and listening modes, maintaining dyanamic gestures when speaking, and engaged idle gestures when listening. Our method generalizes across diverse emotional contexts, producing contextually-appropriate body language: hands on hips and looking down when stressed or rejected (01:26 02:00), lively gestures when excited (02:01 02:26), clenched fists when angry (02:27 02:41), and exaggerated bowing in celebratory agreement (02:41 02:57). To ensure that our model is controllable when it comes to gaze preferences, we also include gaze score which we can tune at test time. For lower gaze scores, the agent avoids direct facing the user. For the exact same input conditioning, increasing the gaze score results in more direct facing (02:58 03:21). When we fully drop out the gaze score (𝑔 = 0), the agents gaze just follows whatever is in-distribution with the training dataset (03:22 03:38). We also compare against existing methods. Compared to MDM [Tevet et al. 2022] our method produces considerably more lively gestures (03:39 03:52). Compared to Audio2Photoreal [Ng et al. 2024], our method produces more realistic motion (03:53 04:07). For Audio2Photoreal, it seems as if the VQ will predict slightly delayed motion which forces the diffusion side to catch up with, which results in distored motion. Compared to TalkSHOW [Yi et al. 2023], our method produces less motion artifacts since we predict the full-body motion in single model (04:08 04:22). Instead, TalkSHOWs VQ-based approach results in distored wrist motion artifacts and ample foot sliding. The real-time nature of our model enables fully interactive AI agents in VR (04:23 end). We generate dyadic conversations using off-the-shelf LLMs paired with text-to-speech modelshere, ChatGPT for dialogue and Kyutai for speech synthesis. This enables applications ranging from entertainment (e.g., gaming NPCs) to personal assistants."
