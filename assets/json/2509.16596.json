            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023; Team, 2024; Yang et al., 2024a) acquire extensive world knowledge through pretraining on massive text corpora (Chen et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023). This knowledge is subsequently shaped through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Yang et al., 2024b) and reinforcement learning (Bai et al., 2022a), enabling LLMs to perform diverse downstream tasks, including reading comprehension (Samuel *Equal Contribution. Corresponding Author. Figure 1: Illustration of parameter restoration. We find that SFT introduces many unnecessary parameter updates, and model performance can be significantly improved by restoring some of the most updated parameters in the fine-tuned model to their original values in the pre-trained model. et al., 2024), code generation (Rozi√®re et al., 2023), and tool use (Ye et al., 2024a,b). Recent research has explored how model knowledge evolves during training. For instance, pretraining has been shown to encode knowledge modularly (Wang et al., 2024), with each parameter storing up to 2 bits of information (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2025). instruction fineConversely, tuning may increase hallucinations (Gekhman et al., 2024; Ghosh et al., 2024). Empirical evidence suggests that preserving the distribution of internal representations is crucial to maintaining performance (Ren et al., 2024), and models with richer knowledge can be easier to fine-tune for enhanced reasoning ability (Ye et al., 2025). Despite these insights, the specific impact of SFT on model knowledge remains insufficiently understood. Key open questions include how model knowledge changes with different categories and scales of fine-tuning data, the mechanisms behind these changes, and strategies to mitigate undesirable effects. This gap limits our ability to predict and control knowledge change behavior in fine-tuned models. To address this, we evaluate five LLMs from the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 families on the closed-book question answering (CBQA) task. We categorize fine-tuning data into five groups based on the knowledge mastery level and systematically examine how performance varies across these categories and different data scales. Surprisingly, models fine-tuned with 1,920 samples perform up to 14% worse than those fine-tuned with only 240 samples. Moreover, performance fluctuates by over 12% depending on the data category used. To investigate these discrepancies, we conduct token-level analysis by computing the KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) between token logits of fine-tuned and pre-trained models (Section 4). Our results show that as fine-tuning data size increases, KL divergence initially decreases, reflecting reduced deviation from the pre-trained model. However, beyond threshold, KL divergence sharply rises, especially when fine-tuning on poorly mastered data, correlating with performance degradation. Building on these findings, we perform parameter-level analysis (Section 5) by selectively restoring parameters that changed most during SFT back to their pre-trained values (Figure 1). We observe that restoring up to 90% of parameter updates does not harm and can even improve performance on training and test sets, with improvements exceeding 10% in some cases. This indicates that many SFT-induced updates are unnecessary for knowledge enhancement, suggesting new directions for optimizing fine-tuning. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We conduct extensive experiments on the CBQA task and reveal surprising effects of fine-tuning data category and scale on model knowledge. Through token-level and parameter-level analyses, we find that 90% of the parameter updates from fine-tuning do not contribute to knowledge enhancement. We demonstrate that restoring these parameters improves model performance, offering practical guidance for more effective finetuning strategies."

            "content": "CBQA and Model Knowledge The CBQA task evaluates an LLMs ability to answer factual questions using its internal knowledge, without relying on external reference materials (Zhang et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2024; Sticha et al., 2024). This makes CBQA rigorous test of the models knowledge accuracy and completeness. One significant challenge in CBQA is addressing hallucinations-instances where the model generates incorrect or fabricated answers (Huang et al., 2023; Kandpal et al., 2023; Kang and Choi, 2023). To mitigate hallucinations and enhance performance, several strategies have been proposed. For instance, Ren et al. (2024) investigate the impact of fine-tuning on the consistency of models pre-existing knowledge, emphasizing the need for stable knowledge retention during finetuning. Similarly, Gekhman et al. (2024) identify overfitting to fine-tuning data as major source of hallucinations, noting that fine-tuning with data unfamiliar to the model exacerbates this issue. Additionally, Ye et al. (2024c) examine how variations in dataset size and quality influence CBQA outcomes, highlighting the trade-offs between data volume and model performance. Despite these advances, prior studies primarily focus on dataset characteristics and overlook the fine-tuning processs internal dynamics. In contrast, our work provides detailed analysis at both the token and parameter levels, identifying unnecessary parameter updates during fine-tuning as key factor contributing to performance degradation on CBQA. Data Quality and Scale of SFT SFT plays pivotal role in adapting LLMs to labeled data, enabling strong performance on downstream tasks. Consequently, constructing high-quality finetuning datasets is critical for maximizing SFTs effectiveness (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024). Recent research highlights the effectiveness of SFT with small, high-quality datasets, achieving performance on par with larger datasets (Zhou et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025b). High-quality data is typically characterized as accurate, diverse, and complex (Huang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024d; Yang et al., 2025a), prompting efforts to synthesize such datasets automatically (Xu et al., 2023, 2024; Zhu et al., 2024). Concurrently, studies show that scaling the quantity of fine-tuning data, while maintaining quality, can yield further performance improvements (Kaplan et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2024). While prior work has explored dataset quality and size, few studies have examined how models prior knowledge of fine-tuning data influences performance or how different data quantities affect the models knowledge. Our study differs by investigating SFT performance on the CBQA task, focusing on how mastery levels and data scale impact model knowledge."

Notably, models fine-tuned with data from DM train0 exhibit steeper performance drop compared to those trained on other data types. For instance, when finetuned with 1,920 entries, the AccM test difference between LLaMA-3-8B models trained on DM train0 and DM train2 reaches 12.06%, which is 1.50 times the difference observed with only 240 training entries. Table 2 illustrates the performance of LLaMA-3 family models across various test sets when fine-tuned with 1,920 entries from different categories. The results show that models trained on DM train0 experience substantial performance degradation on test sets other than DM test0. More generally, training on low-mastery data significantly impairs performance on high-mastery test data. Conversely, training on high-mastery data (e.g., DM train4) leads to suboptimal performance on low-mastery test data. Training with mid-level mastery data, such as DM train2, strikes better balance, yielding superior overall performance."

While model performance generally declines when the fine-tuned data exceeds 240 entries, the Given the performance degradation observed in Section 3.4, we investigate the underlying token Figure 4: Performance on DM fine-tuned on LLaMA-3-8B. test4 (AccM test4) of LLMs distribution shifts caused by SFT. Specifically, we use KL divergence to quantify the differences in token probabilities between fine-tuned and pretrained models. higher KL divergence suggests more significant shift in the models token probability distribution. Data Selection Given that the pre-trained model is used to complement the prior text, the quality of its completions depends on both the input prompt and the structure of the mapping template, as outlined in Section 3.3. The selection of appropriate data is critical to ensuring the robustness of the results. For DM test4, we observe that the pre-trained models completion success rate exceeds 75% across multiple samples and templates, suggesting that this dataset is relatively insensitive to variations in the mapping template. In contrast, other datasets are more sensitive to such variations, so our comparison of different LLMs in this section is limited to DM test4. For each topic, we select the mapping template yielding the highest success rate across samples and focus our analysis on tokens in completions where the answers appear near the beginning of the generated text. Logits Re-normalization Our goal is to compute the KL divergence between the logits distributions for the first token predicted by both the fine-tuned and pre-trained LLMs. However, as shown in Figure 3, the pre-trained model tends to assign higher probabilities to common dummy words (e.g., the, a, etc.), whereas fine-tuned models typically reduce the likelihood of these words in If we directly favor of more relevant tokens. compute the KL divergence on the raw logits, these dummy words could distort the results and obscure meaningful differences between the Figure 5: KL divergence of logits distribution between LLaMA-3-8B fine-tuned with different datasets and the pre-trained one. models.

Specifically, we sort the logits predicted by the fine-tuned model and extract the top 10 values, denoted as l0, l1, . . . , l9. We then identify the corresponding logits, 9, from the pre-trained models completions. Moreover, we apply the softmax function to these logits to derive their normalized probabilities, respectively: 1, . . . , 0, pi = Softmax(li), = Softmax(l i).

From these results, we derive two key findings. Finding 1 Regardless of the category of finetuning data, the difference in predicted logits distributions between the fine-tuned and pre-trained models initially decreases and then increases as the amount of data grows. Figure 5 illustrates how the predicted logits distributions of fine-tuned model diverge from the pre-trained model as training data increases. When fine-tuning with small dataset (e.g., 60 samples), the logits distribution shifts significantly leading to unstable due to insufficient data, training. As the dataset grows (e.g., 240 samples), this discrepancy decreases, indicating improved stability. However, with further increases, the difference in logits distributions grows again, particularly for models trained on DM train0 and DM train1. This suggests that as training data increases, the model deviates further from its pretrained knowledge. The effect is more pronounced when fine-tuning on low-mastery data, making the model more susceptible to knowledge shifts. Finding 2 As the difference in the predicted logits distribution between the fine-tuned model and the pre-trained model increases, model performance declines, indicating negative impact of excessive knowledge shifts. Figure 4 and Figure 5 reveal strong correlation between performance degradation on DM test4 and increasing divergence in logits distributions. Since DM test4 contains samples well mastered by the pre-trained model, substantial shifts in learned knowledge during fine-tuning can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost, thereby degrading performance. This effect is particularly evident when training with large datasets. For instance, the model finetuned on DM train0 experiences the most significant knowledge shift and performs the worst among all fine-tuned models. Since changes in logits distribution reflect underlying modifications to model parameters, we hypothesize that excessive parameter updates during fine-tuning, especially when using large or low-mastery datasets, lead to overall performance decline."

Specifically, we compare the fine-tuned model with the pre-trained model, sorted by the rate of parameter change.6 Table 3 reports the percentage of total parameter updates attributed to different proportions of the most highly updated parameters in LLMs fine-tuned on LLaMA-38B. The results indicate that parameter updates are heavily concentrated in small subset of parameters. For instance, more than 70% of the total updates occur in fewer than 1% of the parameters. Following this, we progressively restore the most significantly updated parameters to their original values in the pre-trained model, starting with the largest updates and gradually including smaller ones, while monitoring the corresponding changes in model performance. This process is illustrated in Figure 1."

Our analysis of these results reveals several noteworthy findings. Finding 1 The majority of parameter updates introduced by SFT are unnecessary and can significantly degrade model knowledge.7 Table 4 shows that restoring portion of the models parameters to their pre-trained values consistently improves performance, regardless of the fine-tuning dataset. For instance, when finetuning with 1,920 samples, restoring 20% of the parameters enhances the performance of all models. Specifically, the model fine-tuned with DM train0 achieves 9.85% performance gain. Table 3 6Specific calculation details can be found in Appendix B.2. 7More discussion can be found in Appendix E.

Importantly, the benefits of parameter restoration generalize across tasks, as shown in Table 5. However, the degree of improvement depends on the relevance of the task to the models knowledge. Notably, performance on the training set also improves, suggesting that many of the parameter updates introduced by SFT neither help fit the training data nor support generalization, and may impair previously learned knowledge. Compared to other strategies, restoring redundant parameter updates is an effective and simple method for enhancing model performance, offering useful insights for designing more efficient fine-tuning approaches.8 8A comparison of different strategies is presented in Appendix C.3. Finding 2 Models fine-tuned with larger datasets or lower-mastery data are more adversely affected by unnecessary parameter changes during SFT. While SFT consistently introduces unnecessary parameter updates that degrade model performance, the extent of this effect depends on the scale and category of fine-tuning data. On one hand, models fine-tuned with larger datasets experience greater impact. Specifically, models trained with 240 samples generally show performance degradation when more than 20% of the parameters are restored. In contrast, models fine-tuned with 1,920 samples continue to gain performance improvements even after restoring 40% of the parameters. This suggests that fine-tuning with 1,920 samples introduces higher proportion of unnecessary updates. Additionally, the maximum performance gain achieved through parameter restoration is greater for models fine-tuned with 1,920 samples than for those fine-tuned with 240 samples. On the other hand, models fine-tuned with low-mastery data are also more affected. Regardless of dataset size, models fine-tuned with DM train0 consistently allow more parameter restoration while achieving greater performance gains compared to other models. For instance, when using 1,920 samples, the model fine-tuned with DM train0 can restore 40% of the parameters and achieve 10.48% performance gain, whereas the model fine-tuned with DM train4 achieves maximum gain of only 3.44% after restoring 20% of the parameters."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of five LLMs across two families on the CBQA task, revealing that both the category and scale of finetuning data significantly influence performance in unexpected ways. Through token-level analysis, we find that large changes in token logits correlate with degraded model performance, suggesting that excessive parameter updates can harm model knowledge. At the parameter level, we show that up to 90% of the updates made during SFT are unnecessary or even detrimental for knowledge enhancement. By selectively restoring these updates, we improve model performance while preserving prior knowledge. Our findings challenge conventional fine-tuning practices and offer practical guidance for developing more efficient methods for LLMs."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Although we conduct an in-depth analysis of anomalies arising from SFT, our work has certain limitations. On one hand, the study does not propose more efficient fine-tuning strategy based on the findings. This is because the focus is on phenomenological analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of SFT on model knowledge. Future work should focus on designing adaptive fine-tuning strategies that minimize unnecessary updates while maximizing performance gains. On the other hand, due to resource constraints, the analysis is limited to the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 model series. However, preliminary validation on other model families shows that the conclusions generalize, suggesting broader applicability."

LLaMA-2 Family The LLaMA-2 family includes three open-source LLMs developed by Meta. These models are pre-trained on over 2 trillion tokens, equipping them with extensive world knowledge and strong semantic representations. For this study, we select LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, and LLaMA-270B. LLaMA-3 Family The LLaMA-3 family builds upon the LLaMA-2 architecture with significant advancements, such as improved parameter efficiency and task generalization. We analyze LLaMA-3-8B and LLaMA-3-70B. B.2 Details of Parameter Restoration To assess how excessive parameter updates affect model performance, we compare the fine-tuned model with the pre-trained model by ranking parameters according to their relative change. For each parameter i, let pi denote its value before fine-tuning and si its value afterward. The relative change is defined as: ri = si pi pi We sort all parameters in descending order of ri to obtain the set I. To measure the concentration of parameter updates, we compute the cumulative sum of ri for the top percentage of parameters in I, divided by the total sum of all ri. For instance, Table 3 shows that the top 1% of parameters contribute 70.59% of the total relative change."

C.1 Test Results for the LLaMA-2 Family Models We fine-tune five LLMs using datasets with five different levels of mastery. The results for the LLaMA-3 family models are presented in Section 3.4, while the results for the LLaMA-2 family are shown in Figure 6. Notably, although the peak performance occurs at different data sizes depending on the base model and hyperparameters, the trend of performance degradation beyond certain point (size) remains consistent.

The results in Table 6 show that parameter reduction improves model performance on the training set, further supporting the idea that SFT introduces significant number of unnecessary or even detrimental parameter updates.

C.3 Comparison of Results Across Different Strategies We compare the performance of LLaMA-3-8B trained using four different strategies: LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct: chat-optimized version fine-tuned by Meta, demonstrating strong performance across various benchmarks. SFT (Mixed): Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B using randomly mixed dataset. Results are tested across different data volumes, with the best outcomes reported. SFT (Divided): Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B with data divided based on the models mastery level. The best results are reported when fine-tuning with 1,920 samples. LoRA: Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B using randomly mixed dataset with LoRA (Hu et al., 2022). Parameter Restore: Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B using the divided dataset, followed by parameter restoration process. The best results are reported when fine-tuning with 1,920 samples. The results in Table 7 indicate that data division and parameter restoration strategies significantly enhance model performance, offering valuable insights for optimizing data selection and fine-tuning approaches.

            "content": "E.1 Distribution of Redundant Parameter Updates To investigate why SFT leads to redundant parameter updates, we analyze the distribution of redundant parameters in LLaMA-3-8B. As shown in Table 9 and Table 10, these parameters are spread across all layers of the model, with higher concentration in the initial layers (i.e, 02), fewer in the final layers (i.e., 3031), and more uniform distribution in the middle layers (i.e., 329). This pattern may be due to the initial layers primarily encoding semantic information that is already well-learned during pretraining, resulting in greater parameter redundancy. In contrast, the final layers, which focus on output formatting, exhibit less redundancy. Furthermore, we observe that most redundant parameters are concentrated in the FFN layers, suggesting that their high parameter count presents potential target for optimization. We also acknowledge that the emergence of redundant parameters may be linked to the lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle and Carbin, 2019).

E.2 Layers for Preserving Model Behavior To identify which layers are most critical for preserving model behavior, we perform experiments that selectively restore parameters in different layers and evaluate the resulting performance. As shown in Table 11, our results reveal that the lower layers (03) are most crucial for maintaining model behavior, while the middle layers (427) have the least impact. This implies that SFT affects not only the predictive distributions in the upper layers but also substantially modifies the lower-layer parameters, thereby influencing overall model performance."

            "content": "In this section, we provide additional details on data processing. F.1 Robust Multi-Template Complementation Mechanism (2024c), consider knowledge fact represented as triple As described in Ye et al. (subject, relation, object), such as (P ainblanc, Given sentence = map(subject, relation) that maps the subject and relation (e.g., Painblanc is located in), an LLM is considered to have memorized if it can predict = map(object) by mapping the object (e.g., France) such that M(x). locatedin, rance). Since is probabilistic model influenced by different mapping templates and sampling probabilities, we design Nmap = 21 different mappings for each knowledge fact k. With the temperature set to 0.7, the model generates Nsample = 10 outputs for each mapping. The degree to which the LLM memorizes is then calculated as: RM = (cid:80)Nmap i=1 (cid:80)Nsample j=1 I(yi Mj(xi)) Nmap Nsample where xi and yi represent the results from the ith mapping, Mj denotes the jth sampled output, and I() is the indicator function. This approach effectively utilizes the characteristics of LLMs to evaluate their mastery of different data. However, as entities often have multiple aliases (e.g., USA and United States), the singular entity labeling in the original dataset may introduce biases. To enhance robustness, synonym mapping table  (Table 12)  is constructed to expand the set of equivalent entity names, significantly improving result accuracy. This table is also used in judging the accuracy of LLMs answers after SFT.
