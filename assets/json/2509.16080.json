            "content": "The study of stratiﬁed shear ﬂows traces its origins to the pioneering observations of Hermann von Helmholtz in 1868 and Lord Kelvin in 1871, who independently recognized that velocity discontinuities across density interfaces could generate wave-like instabilities [1, 2]. These early theoretical insights, derived from linearized stability analysis of idealized velocity proﬁles, established the foundation for understanding turbulent mixing in geophysical ﬂuids. The subsequent century witnessed gradual reﬁnement of stability criteria, culminating in the seminal contributions demonstrating that the Richardson number fundamentally controls instability growth through the competition between destabilizing shear and stabilizing stratiﬁcation [3, 4]. This theoretical framework, developed through mathematical analysis of simpliﬁed conﬁgurations, remains central to modern understanding of atmospheric and oceanic mixing processes. Experimental investigations revealed that Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) billows undergo characteristic life cycle from initial exponential growth through nonlinear saturation to eventual turbulent breakdown 1 [5]. Laboratory experiments in stratiﬁed tilt tanks demonstrated that mixing eﬃciency peaks during the transition from laminar billows to three-dimensional turbulence, with irreversible density changes occurring primarily during the collapse phase [5]. These controlled experiments, while necessarily limited in scale and parameter range, provided crucial validation of theoretical predictions and revealed unexpected phenomena including billow pairing, secondary instabilities, and asymmetric mixing patterns absent from linear theory [6]. The development of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) techniques in the 1990s enabled quantitative measurements of velocity and density ﬁelds simultaneously, revealing the detailed structure of mixing events [7]. Field observations in natural environments demonstrate both the ubiquity and complexity of KH instabilities across scales from meters to hundreds of kilometers. Atmospheric manifestations range from cloud billows visible in satellite imagery to clear-air turbulence aﬀecting aviation safety [8]. Oceanic examples span from estuarine mixing to equatorial undercurrents [9, 10]. However, these observations reveal systematic departures from laboratory-based scaling laws, particularly in environments with multiple shear interfaces, rotational eﬀects, or time-dependent forcing. The mixing eﬃciency, deﬁned as the ratio of buoyancy ﬂux to turbulent kinetic energy dissipation, varies by an order of magnitude across diﬀerent geophysical contexts, challenging universal parameterizations based solely on Richardson number [11]. Recent measurements using modern observation systems have documented intermittent mixing events that dominate time-averaged ﬂuxes, highlighting the importance of rare but intense instability events [12]. The computational investigation of KH dynamics evolved from early ﬁnite-diﬀerence solutions in the 1960s to contemporary spectral and ﬁnite-volume methods capable of resolving the full range of dynamical scales [13]. Initial numerical studies employed two-dimensional domains with periodic boundaries, revealing the fundamental mechanisms of vortex roll-up and pairing. The extension to three-dimensional simulations in the 1980s, enabled by vector supercomputers, demonstrated the critical role of spanwise perturbations in triggering transition to turbulence [14]. Modern direct numerical simulations achieve Reynolds numbers approaching geophysical values but require billions of grid points and thousands of processor hours, limiting systematic parameter exploration [15]. Large-eddy simulations (LES) reduce computational demands through subgrid-scale modeling but introduce closure assumptions that yield order-of-magnitude variations in predicted mixing rates [16]. The mathematical formulation of stratiﬁed shear ﬂows relies on the Boussinesq approximation, which treats density variations as dynamically important only in buoyancy terms while maintaining constant density in inertial terms. This simpliﬁcation, rigorously justiﬁed through scale analysis when density variations remain below approximately ten percent, reduces the compressible Navier-Stokes equations to an incompressible system with buoyancy forcing [17, 18]. The resulting equations admit analytical solutions only for highly idealized conﬁgurations, necessitating numerical approaches for realistic parameter regimes. The two-dimensional restriction, while excluding certain three-dimensional instabilities, captures the primary mixing mechanisms since linear stability analysis demonstrates that the fastest-growing KH modes are inherently two-dimensional [19]. This dimensional reduction enables highresolution simulations at moderate computational cost, facilitating parameter studies impossible in fully three-dimensional conﬁgurations. Recent advances in scientiﬁc computing, particularly the development of just-in-time (JIT) compilation and optimized array libraries, enable high-performance simulations using interpreted languages previously considered unsuitable for computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) [20, 21]. Python, with its extensive scientiﬁc ecosystem and emphasis on code readability, provides an ideal platform for developing transparent, reproducible simulation tools [22, 23]. The combination of NumPy for array operations, SciPy for spectral transforms, and Numba for performance optimization achieves high computational eﬃciency while dramatically improving code accessibility [24]. The fractional-step projection method provides robust algorithm for solving the incompressible ﬂow equations while maintaining the divergence-free constraint essential for physical accuracy [13, 25, 26]. This study presents kh2d-solver, an open-source Python implementation designed to democratize access to high-ﬁdelity KH simulations for research and educational applications. The solver addresses the gap between simpliﬁed analytical models and computationally intensive three-dimensional simulations by providing an eﬃcient, transparent framework for investigating idealized two-dimensional conﬁgurations. Four canonical test cases systematically explore parameter dependencies across Richardson numbers from 0.1 to 0.3 and Reynolds numbers from 1000 to 5000, spanning regimes from marginal stability to fully developed turbulence. Comprehensive statistical analysis employing Shannon entropy, complexity indices, and nonparametric tests quantiﬁes the evolution of ﬂow structures beyond traditional mean and variance metrics [27]. The implementation achieves suﬃcient computational eﬃciency to enable parameter 2 studies on standard desktop hardware, with detailed documentation and visualization tools facilitating both research applications and pedagogical use. By providing open access to validated simulation capabilities, this work aims to accelerate understanding of fundamental mixing processes relevant to climate modeling, ocean dynamics, and atmospheric transport phenomena."

The analysis begins with the fundamental postulates of continuum mechanics and proceeds through careful approximations justiﬁed by the physical scales characteristic of geophysical ﬂows. Consider an inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element in three-dimensional space. Let = (X 1, 2, 3) denote the Lagrangian coordinates labeling material particles at initial time t0, and = (x1, x2, x3) represent the Eulerian coordinates at time t.

The most general linear isotropic relation is [44] σij = pδij + λδij Dkk + 2µDij, (14) where is thermodynamic pressure, λ and µ are viscosity coeﬃcients, and the rate-of-deformation tensor is ui xj + For geophysical ﬂows, the incompressibility approximation applies when ﬂow velocities are much smaller than sound speed. In the atmosphere, typical wind speeds ( 10 m/s) are negligible compared to sound speed ( 340 m/s). In the ocean, currents ( 0.11 m/s) are far below the sound speed in water ( 1500 m/s). This justiﬁes setting uj xi Dij = (15) 1 2 (cid:18) (cid:19) . = ui xi = 0. (16) Under incompressibility, Dkk = 0, eliminating the bulk viscosity term. The stress tensor simpliﬁes to σij = pδij + 2µDij = pδij + µ ui xj + uj xi .

(18) Geophysical ﬂows exhibit density stratiﬁcation due to temperature variations (atmosphere), salinity gradients (ocean), or compositional diﬀerences (planetary atmospheres). Following Milhajan [17], we performed systematic scale analysis. Let ρ denote density variations and ρ0 reference density: ρ(x, t) = ρ0 + ρ(x, t), where = ε 1. (19) The small parameter ε typically ranges from 103 in strong oceanic thermoclines to 102 in atmospheric fronts. Substituting into equation (18): (ρ0 + ρ) ui + uj ui xj (cid:18) (cid:19) = xi + µ 2ui xjxj + (ρ0 + ρ)f i. (20) The Boussinesq approximation systematically expands in powers of ε.

Their ratio yields the Richardson number: Ri = gρL ρ0U 2 = gεL 2 = O(1), conﬁrming that buoyancy eﬀects remain signiﬁcant despite small ε. Neglecting O(ε) terms in inertia but retaining them in buoyancy: ui + uj ui xj ρ0 (cid:18) (cid:19) = xi + µ 2ui xjxj + (ρ0 + ρ)f i. The gravitational body force acts vertically: = gδi3. The pressure was decomposed into hydrostatic and dynamic components: p(x, t) = p0(z) + p(x, t), where the reference pressure satisﬁes hydrostatic balance: dp0 dz = ρ0g. (23) (24) This decomposition removed the dominant balance, isolating dynamically relevant gradients. Substituting and using equation (24): ui + uj ui xj = 1 ρ0 xi + ν 2ui xjxj ρ ρ gδi3, (25) where ν = µ/ρ0 is kinematic viscosity. The density perturbation evolves through advection-diﬀusion.

            "title": "2.2 Numerical Implementation",
            "content": "The numerical solution of the governing equations (32)(34) requires careful treatment of the nonlinear advection terms, viscous diﬀusion, and the pressure-velocity coupling inherent in incompressible ﬂows. Our implementation draws inspiration from the Fortran 95 solver developed by Kampf [30], which demonstrated the feasibility of simulating KH instabilities using fractional-step approach with Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) iteration for the pressure Poisson equation. However, we depart signiﬁcantly from that implementation by employing spectral methods for the pressure solver rather than iterative techniques. Where Kampfs solver requires 8000 SOR iterations per time step to achieve convergence with tolerance 103, our Fast Sine Transform approach achieves machine precision in O(N log ) operations without iteration. This spectral method, originally developed by Swarztrauber et al. [35], exploits the periodic boundary conditions to diagonalize the discrete Laplacian operator, reducing the computational cost by approximately two orders of magnitude for typical grid resolutions. Furthermore, while the Fortran implementation employs sophisticated Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) advection scheme with ﬂux limiters, we adopt ﬁrst-order upwind diﬀerencing that, despite its simplicity, provides suﬃcient numerical diﬀusion to stabilize sharp gradients characteristic of KH billows without requiring explicit slope limiting. The implementation leverages modern Python scientiﬁc computing libraries including NumPy [20] for array operations, SciPy [24] for spectral methods, and Numba [21] for JIT compilation, achieving performance comparable to compiled languages while maintaining development ﬂexibility. This represents fundamental shift from traditional Fortran-based CFD codes toward more accessible, maintainable implementations. Where Kampfs solver outputs formatted ASCII ﬁles requiring post-processing for visualization, our framework generates self-describing NetCDF-4 ﬁles with CF metadata conventions, enabling direct integration with modern analysis tools. The fractional-step projection method we employ, originally developed by Chorin [13] and rigorously analyzed by Temam [25, 26], decouples the pressure-velocity coupling through operator splitting following the same mathematical principles as Kampfs implementation but with enhanced computational eﬃciency through spectral methods. Additionally, our adaptive time-stepping algorithm automatically balances CFL and viscous stability constraints, eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning required in ﬁxed time-step implementations, thereby enabling robust parameter studies across diverse Richardson and Reynolds number regimes without user intervention. The projection method, comprehensively reviewed by Guermond et al. [31], decomposes the time advancement into predictor step that ignores pressure gradients followed by correction step that enforces incompressibility. Beginning with the dimensional momentum equations (28)(29), we introduce an intermediate velocity ﬁeld = (u, w) through the fractional steps: un + (un )un = ν2un ρn ρ0 gez, un+1 t = 1 ρ0 un+1 = 0, pn+1, (36) (37) (38) where superscript denotes the discrete time level tn = nt, with representing the time step, un = (un, wn) the velocity ﬁeld at time tn, and ez the unit vector in the vertical direction. Taking the divergence of equation (37) and enforcing the incompressibility constraint (38) yields the pressure Poisson equation: ρ0 The computational domain Ω = [0, Lx] [0, Lz] is discretized using uniform Cartesian grid with 2pn+1 = u. (39) spacing: xi = ix, = 0, 1, . . . , Nx 1, = zj = jz, = 0, 1, . . . , Nz 1, = Lx Nx 1 Lz Nz , , (40) (41) where Nx and Nz denote the number of grid points in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Let qn i,j q(xi, zj, tn) represent the discrete approximation of any ﬁeld variable {u, w, ρ, p} at grid point (i, j) and time level n. The nonlinear advection terms demand special treatment to ensure numerical stability near sharp gradients characteristic of KH billows. Following the pioneering work of Courant et al. [32] and the highresolution schemes of Harten [33], we employ ﬁrst-order upwind diﬀerencing that maintains monotonicity through directionally-biased stencils. For generic scalar ﬁeld advected by velocity (u, w), the discrete advection operators are: x (cid:18) (cid:19)i,j z (cid:18) (cid:19)i,j ui,j ui,j wi,j wi,j qi,j qi1,j qi+1,j qi,j qi,j qi,j1 qi,j+1 qi,j = = if ui,j > 0, if ui,j < 0, if wi,j > 0, if wi,j < 0. (42) (43) This upwind scheme, while introducing numerical diﬀusion of order O(ux), acts as implicit subgridscale dissipation that stabilizes the solution without requiring explicit ﬁltering, as demonstrated in the ﬂux-corrected transport algorithms of Boris et al. [34]. The discrete advection update for any transported quantity becomes: i,j = qn i,j [Ax(un, qn)i,j + Az(wn, qn)i,j] , (44) where Ax and Az denote the upwind operators deﬁned in equations (42)(43). The viscous diﬀusion terms are discretized using second-order central diﬀerences, yielding the discrete Laplacian operator: 2qi,j = qi+1,j 2qi,j + qi1,j x2 + qi,j+1 2qi,j + qi,j1 z2 . (45) For computational eﬃciency, the implementation adaptively switches between explicit and implicit time integration schemes based on the diﬀusive stability criterion. When the following stability constraints are satisﬁed: x2 < we employ the explicit forward Euler update: ν 1 4 and ν z2 < 1 , (46) (47) qn+1 i,j = qn i,j + νt2qn i,j . For larger time steps that would violate conditions (46), we switch to an implicit backward Euler scheme solved iteratively through the Jacobi method: q(k+1) i,j = i,j + α(q(k) qn i+1,j + q(k) i1,j) + β(q(k) i,j+1 + q(k) i,j1) 1 + 2α + 2β , (48) where α = νt/(2x2), β = νt/(2z2) are the dimensionless diﬀusion numbers, and superscript (k) denotes the iteration level within the Jacobi solver. The pressure Poisson equation (39) with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (p/n = 0 on Ω) is solved using the Fast Sine Transform (FST) method developed by Swarztrauber et al. [35], achieving machine precision with O(N log ) computational complexity. The pressure ﬁeld is expanded in discrete sine basis functions that automatically satisfy the boundary conditions: Nx2 Nz2 pi,j = ˆpk,l sin Xk=1 Xl=1 (cid:18) 7 πki Nx 1 sin (cid:19) (cid:18) πlj Nz 1 , (cid:19) (49) where ˆpk,l are the spectral coeﬃcients in Fourier space. Substituting expansion (49) into the discrete Laplacian transforms the Poisson equation into an algebraic system in spectral space: ˆpk,l = ˆfk,l λk,l , (50) where ˆfk,l represents the Fourier coeﬃcients of the divergence ﬁeld u, and the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian are: λk,l = 4 (cid:20) sin2(πk/2(Nx 1)) x2 + sin2(πl/2(Nz 1)) z2 . (cid:21) (51) The implementation employs SciPys optimized DST routines [24], which utilize FFTPACK algorithms for eﬃcient computation on modern architectures. The time step selection ensures numerical stability through adaptive constraints on both advective and diﬀusive processes. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for advection stability requires: tCFL = CCFL min max , max , (cid:19) (cid:18) while the diﬀusive stability constraint imposes: tvisc = Cvisc min x2 ν , z2 ν , (cid:19) (cid:18) (52) (53) where CCFL = 0.4 and Cvisc = 0.2 provide safety margins below theoretical stability limits. The actual time step is chosen as: = min(tCFL, tvisc). (54) The spanwise vorticity component ωz, essential for visualizing KH roll-up patterns and coherent structures, is computed as diagnostic quantity using second-order central diﬀerences: ωi,j = wi+1,j wi1,j 2x ui,j+1 ui,j1 2z . (55) This quantity directly measures the local rotation rate and reveals the characteristic billow structures that deﬁne the instabilitys nonlinear evolution. The computational performance is dramatically enhanced through Numbas JIT compilation [21], which translates Python functions into optimized machine code at runtime. The @jit(nopython=True, parallel=True) decorator enables automatic loop vectorization and multi-threading via OpenMP, achieving 1050 speedup compared to pure Python implementations [28, 29]. Memory access patterns are optimized through contiguous array layouts that maximize cache eﬃciency, while the prange construct enables embarrassingly parallel operations across grid points. Boundary conditions reﬂect the physical conﬁguration appropriate for shear layer studies. Periodic conditions in the streamwise (x) direction: u(0, z, t) = u(Lx, z, t), w(0, z, t) = w(Lx, z, t), ρ(0, z, t) = ρ(Lx, z, t), (56) allow the instability to develop without artiﬁcial conﬁnement. No-slip walls at the vertical (z) boundaries: u(x, 0, t) = u(x, Lz, t) = 0, w(x, 0, t) = w(x, Lz, t) = 0, (57) represent channel ﬂow conﬁgurations commonly used in turbulence studies [14]. The complete algorithm integrates these components through the following sequence: (i) computation of the intermediate velocity via equations (44) and (47) or (48), incorporating advection and diﬀusion operators; (ii) solution of the pressure Poisson equation (39) using the discrete sine transform (50); (iii) projection of the velocity ﬁeld through equation (37) to enforce incompressibility; (iv) update of the density ﬁeld using the same advection-diﬀusion scheme applied to equation (30); and (v) computation of diagnostic quantities including vorticity via equation (55). The simulation output employs NetCDF-4 format [36], the standard for geophysical data storage, providing self-describing, platform-independent storage with CF metadata conventions that ensure compatibility with analysis tools including xarray [37] and NCL. The hierarchical HDF5-based structure enables transparent compression, typically reducing storage requirements by 4060% [38]. 8 Animated GIF visualizations complement the archival data by revealing temporal evolution of coherent structures essential for understanding mixing processes [39]. The dual-panel layout showing vorticity (ωz) and density (ρ) ﬁelds simultaneously facilitates analysis of instability growth, billow pairing, and baroclinic vorticity production that govern mixing eﬃciency [40]. The perceptually uniform colormaps (RdBu for vorticity, viridis for density) ensure accurate interpretation while maintaining accessibility [41]. This numerical framework provides accurate, stable, and eﬃcient simulations of KH instability across the wide range of Reynolds and Richardson numbers relevant to geophysical applications, from laminar laboratory ﬂows to turbulent atmospheric and oceanic shear layers."

The velocity ﬁeld initialization employs hyperbolic tangent proﬁle that smoothly transitions between opposing ﬂows: u(z) = ubot + (utop ubot) 1 + tanh 1 (cid:20) zmid δ , (cid:19)(cid:21) (cid:18) (58) where the shear layer thickness δ = 0.05 is selected to adequately resolve the predicted instability wavelength while maintaining computational tractability. The prescribed velocities utop = 1.0 m/s and ubot = 1.0 m/s generate velocity jump = 2.0 m/s representative of strong shear zones observed in atmospheric jet streams and oceanic western boundary currents. The density stratiﬁcation incorporates two-layer structure with ρtop = 1.0 kg/m3 representing warm, fresh surface water or heated atmospheric air, while ρbot = 1.2 kg/m³ corresponds to cold, saline deep water or dense cool air masses. This 20% density variation mimics strong pycnoclines encountered in tropical oceans where solar heating creates sharp temperature gradients, or atmospheric inversions where radiative cooling produces stable stratiﬁcation [5]. The resulting bulk Richardson number Ri = gρδ/(ρ0U 2) = 0.25 coincides exactly with the marginal stability threshold derived through linear analysis, where perturbation growth rates transition from exponential to algebraic [3, 4]. The selection of critical Richardson number ensures examination of the competition between shear production that generates turbulent kinetic energy and buoyancy forces that suppress vertical motion, balance central to understanding mixing eﬃciency in geophysical ﬂows [47]. Instability initiation requires seeding through small-amplitude perturbations: u(x, z) = ε sin(4πx/Lx) exp zmid δ 2 , # (cid:19) \" (cid:18) (59) where ε = 0.01U provides suﬃcient amplitude for growth while remaining within the linear regime, and the wavelength λ = Lx/2 matches the most unstable mode predicted by stability analysis for this parameter regime [48]. Operating at Re = 1000 places the ﬂow in transitional regime where initial laminar billows undergo secondary instabilities leading to turbulent breakdown, analogous to processes observed in nocturnal atmospheric jets [8] and tidally-driven oceanic shear layers [9]."

            "content": "Geophysical ﬂows frequently exhibit multiple shear interfaces due to complex stratiﬁcation patterns, necessitating understanding of interaction dynamics between adjacent unstable layers. Atmospheric examples include the dual jet structure where subtropical and polar jets create multiple critical layers 9 [49], while oceanic manifestations appear in equatorial undercurrents with alternating velocity maxima [10]. The velocity proﬁle incorporates two hyperbolic tangent interfaces: u(z) = umax tanh (cid:20) (cid:18) z1 δ tanh (cid:19) (cid:18) z2 δ 1 , (cid:19) (cid:21) (60) with interface positions z1 = Lz/2 s/2 and z2 = Lz/2 + s/2 separated by distance = 0.3 m, approximately six shear layer thicknesses ensuring initial independence while permitting subsequent interaction. The reduced thickness δ = 0.04 compared to the single-layer case maintains adequate resolution of individual interfaces despite the increased complexity. The density conﬁguration adopts three-layer stratiﬁcation with heavy ﬂuid (ρ = 1.5 kg/m3) occupying the upper and lower regions while light ﬂuid (ρ = 1.0 kg/m3) resides in the central jet region. This arrangement replicates atmospheric temperature inversions where warm air masses become trapped between cooler layers, commonly observed in urban heat islands and frontal systems where diﬀerential advection creates complex thermal structures [6]. The inverted density gradient at each interface promotes symmetric instability development with opposing buoyancy forces, enabling investigation of billow interaction mechanisms including vortex pairing, amalgamation, and competitive growth observed in laboratory experiments and ﬁeld observations [7]. Operating parameters Re = 2000 and Ri = 0.1 create strongly shear-dominated conditions where instability growth occurs rapidly with minimal buoyancy suppression. The enhanced Reynolds number relative to Test Case 1 captures increased nonlinear interactions arising from proximity eﬀects between developing billows, while the reduced Richardson number ensures vigorous turbulent transition with enhanced mixing rates characteristic of high-shear environments [15]. This conﬁguration elucidates momentum transport mechanisms in complex shear ﬂows where traditional single-interface assumptions break down."

Although the two-dimensional formulation precludes explicit rotation terms, we incorporate rotational eﬀects through background geostrophic shear that approximates the inﬂuence of planetary vorticity: u(x, z) = ushear(z) + (z Lz/2), (61) where the base shear proﬁle ushear follows equation (58) and the linear term with coeﬃcient = 0.5 s1 represents an eﬀective Coriolis parameter scaled to the domain dimensions, corresponding to mid-latitude conditions at approximately 45 latitude when accounting for aspect ratio eﬀects. Enhanced density stratiﬁcation with ρtop = 1.0 kg/m3 and ρbot = 1.3 kg/m3 produces 30% density variation characteristic of strong seasonal thermoclines in subtropical oceans where solar heating creates pronounced near-surface stratiﬁcation [51]. The increased density contrast relative to the nonrotating case compensates for rotational stabilization, which inhibits vertical motion through the TaylorProudman constraint and modiﬁes the instability structure through potential vorticity conservation [52]. This stronger stratiﬁcation maintains comparable instability growth rates despite the additional rotational constraint, reﬂecting observations from rotating tank experiments and oceanic measurements showing reduced mixing eﬃciency under rotation [53]. Conﬁguration parameters Re = 1500 and Ri = 0.3 place the ﬂow above the canonical stability threshold, accounting for rotational stabilization that shifts the marginal stability boundary to higher Richardson numbers. The intermediate Reynolds number balances resolution requirements with computational cost while capturing essential dynamics of rotationally-inﬂuenced mixing relevant to submesoscale oceanic processes where balanced and unbalanced motions interact [54]. This idealized framework provides insights into mixing suppression mechanisms in rotating stratiﬁed environments characteristic of atmospheric boundary layers at mid-latitudes where inertial oscillations modulate turbulent transport [55]."

            "content": "Geophysical turbulence rarely exists in isolation but rather maintains quasi-equilibrium through continuous energy injection balancing dissipative losses, whether from wind stress at the ocean surface, 10 breaking internal waves in the thermocline, or convective instability in the atmospheric boundary layer [56]. Stochastic forcing represents these energy sources through spectrum of large-scale modes: Fu(x, z, t) = Fw(x, z, t) = Nf Nf Xkx=1 Nf Xkz=1 Nf Xkx=1 Xkz=1 Af + k2 k2 Af + k2 k2 sin(2πkxx/Lx + φkx,kz ) cos(2πkzz/Lz), cos(2πkxx/Lx) sin(2πkzz/Lz + φkx,kz ), (62) (63) where Nf = 5 modes concentrate energy injection at scales exceeding the natural instability wavelength, preventing direct interference with billow formation while maintaining energy cascade toward dissipation scales. The forcing amplitude Af = 0.1 m/s² is calibrated to sustain turbulent ﬂuctuations without overwhelming stratiﬁcation eﬀects, analogous to moderate wind forcing in the ocean mixed layer or thermal convection in atmospheric boundary layers. Random phases φkx,kz ensure statistical homogeneity while maintaining divergence-free forcing consistent with incompressibility constraint (38). The spectral distribution following k1 scaling in amplitude concentrates energy at large scales, mimicking atmospheric storm systems injecting momentum into ocean surface layers or internal wave breaking cascading energy to smaller scales [57]. Weak stratiﬁcation with ρtop = 1.0 kg/m³ and ρbot = 1.1 kg/m³ represents 10% density variation typical of ocean mixed layers where turbulent stirring homogenizes properties while maintaining suﬃcient stratiﬁcation for buoyancy eﬀects [12]. This modest density contrast permits vigorous turbulence development characteristic of convective boundary layers where thermal plumes penetrate into stably stratiﬁed regions above, generating entrainment and mixing analogous to cloud-top processes [16]. The forcing mechanism modiﬁes the momentum equation through additional source terms in the predictor step (36), maintaining energy input throughout the simulation duration. Enhanced resolution using 384 192 grid at Re = 5000 and Ri = 0.15 enables resolution of an extended inertial range spanning approximately two decades in wavenumber space, suﬃcient for examining cascade dynamics and spectral ﬂux characteristics in stratiﬁed turbulence [58]. The moderate Richardson number below the critical threshold ensures sustained turbulence without relaminarization, facilitating investigation of mixing eﬃciency dependencies relevant to parameterization development for climate models where subgrid-scale turbulent ﬂuxes must be represented [11]. Extended integration to tﬁnal = 30 allows statistical equilibrium establishment where forcing, cascade, and dissipation balance, providing ensemble-averaged quantities for comparison with theoretical predictions and observational scaling laws. Each test case employs adaptive time-stepping via criterion (54) ensuring numerical stability across varying ﬂow conditions while maximizing computational eﬃciency. Integration periods of tﬁnal = 10, 15, 20, and 30 seconds for respective cases capture complete instability life cycles from linear growth through nonlinear saturation to turbulent decay or statistical equilibrium. The vorticity ﬁeld computed through equation (55) provides primary visualization of coherent structures and turbulent eddies, while density evolution quantiﬁes irreversible mixing fundamental to diapycnal transport in stratiﬁed geophysical systems [59]. These idealized experiments establish hierarchy of complexity from simple shear layers to forced turbulence, enabling systematic investigation of parameter dependencies governing mixing eﬃciency in atmospheric and oceanic ﬂows [60, 61]."

            "content": "Following completion of the four numerical experiments, post-processing statistical analysis framework was implemented to quantify the dynamical evolution of KH instabilities across the parameter space explored. This analysis operates independently of the numerical solver, processing the NetCDF output ﬁles generated from each test case to extract quantitative measures of ﬂow complexity, mixing eﬃciency, and statistical properties. The framework leverages NumPy [20] for array operations, SciPy [24] for statistical functions, and xarray [37] for eﬃcient manipulation of the multi-dimensional NetCDF datasets produced by the solver. The analysis begins by loading the stored velocity ﬁelds u(x, z, t) and w(x, z, t), density ﬁeld ρ(x, z, t), and computed vorticity ωz(x, z, t) from each of the four test cases: Classical Shear Layer (Test Case 1), Double Shear Layer (Test Case 2), Rotating Shear Layer (Test Case 3), and Forced Turbulence (Test Case 4). For each ﬁeld variable φ, representing either the density perturbation ρ or spanwise vorticity 11 ωz consistent with the formulation in equations (32)(35), Shannon entropy serves as the fundamental measure of spatial disorder following established applications in geophysical ﬂuid dynamics [27]. The spatial entropy is computed as: where pi represents the probability in bin i, computed as: i=1 Nbins H(φ) = pi log pi, pi = nib Ntotal , (64) (65) with ni being the count in bin i, the bin width from 50-bin histogram, Ntotal the total number of valid grid points excluding boundary regions, and Nbins = 50. This metric quantiﬁes information content in the spatial patterns emerging from the KH instability, with higher values indicating increased complexity as the ﬂow transitions from the organized laminar billows characteristic of early evolution to the chaotic turbulent states observed in the mature phase, particularly evident in the forced turbulence scenario (Test Case 4) as demonstrated by [62] for small-scale universality in turbulence. Beyond simple entropy, comprehensive complexity index was developed speciﬁcally for these four test scenarios to capture multiple aspects of ﬂow structure evolution, addressing the absence of established complexity metrics tailored for KH instabilities in current literature [63]. This weighted metric combines gradient-based spatial variability computed from the velocity and density ﬁelds, statistical moments, and entropy through: C(φ) = w1H(φ) + w2σ(φ) + w3 σ(φ) + w4 log(1 + κ(φ)), where the gradient complexity quantiﬁes spatial variability through: σ(φ) = u The normalized standard deviation provides scale-independent variance assessment: s(cid:18) , var + (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:19) φ 2 2 φ σ(φ) = σ(φ) φmax φmin + ǫ , (66) (67) (68) with ǫ = 1010 preventing division by zero, and the excess kurtosis captures departure from Gaussian behavior: κ(φ) = µ4 σ4 3, (69) characteristic of intermittent turbulence. The weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) = (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2) were selected to balance contributions from diﬀerent complexity aspects, emphasizing equally the information-theoretic content and local gradient variations while incorporating global statistical properties relevant to each test cases distinct dynamics. The gradients required for complexity calculations, consistent with the spatial discretization employed in the numerical solver (equations 4041), utilize second-order central diﬀerences implemented through NumPys gradient function: φ φ (cid:18) (cid:18) (cid:19)i,j (cid:19)i,j = = φi,j+1 φi,j1 2x φi+1,j φi1,j 2z , , (70) (71) where = Lx/(Nx 1) and = Lz/(Nz 1) match the grid spacings from the computational domain discretization. This numerical diﬀerentiation scheme maintains consistency with the secondorder accuracy of the solver while providing eﬃcient computation for the large datasets generated from each test case, particularly the high-resolution forced turbulence simulation with its 384 192 grid.

(cid:21) Normality assessment employs multiple complementary tests to characterize the evolution from nearGaussian initial conditions imposed by equations (58)(59) to the heavy-tailed distributions characteristic of developed turbulence observed in all four test cases. The Shapiro-Wilk test, optimal for sample sizes up to 5000 points [64], computes the statistic: = 2 i=1 aix(i) i=1(xi x)2 , (cid:0)P (cid:1) where x(i) are the ordered statistics and ai are tabulated coeﬃcients maximizing power for detecting non-normality.

Subsequently, pairwise Mann-Whitney tests isolate speciﬁc diﬀerences between test case pairs through the statistic: providing robust comparisons unaﬀected by outliers common in turbulent data [68]. The Friedman test: U1 = n1n2 + n1(n1 + 1) 2 R1, (82) χ2 = 12 nk(k + 1) R2 3n(k + 1), (83) j=1 complements these analyses for repeated measures when examining temporal evolution within each test case.

The instantaneous mixing parameter: where the density standard deviation: and root-mean-square vorticity: Γ(t) = σρ(t) ωrms(t), σρ(t) = var(ρ), ωrms(t) = hω2 i, (84) (85) (86) with angle brackets denoting spatial averaging over the domain, captures the essential coupling between stratiﬁcation and vortical motions driving irreversible mixing. This formulation proves particularly relevant for comparing the baseline shear layer (Test Case 1) with the enhanced mixing observed in forced turbulence (Test Case 4), while more sophisticated measures incorporating background potential energy evolution exist [59], this formulation provides computational eﬃciency suitable for extensive parameter studies while maintaining physical relevance to the mixing processes observed across our four test scenarios [15]. Temporal evolution analysis tracks all metrics across the simulation time spans: tﬁnal = 10s for Test Case 1, 15s for Test Case 2, 20s for Test Case 3, and 30s for Test Case 4. This enables identiﬁcation of distinct dynamical stages characteristic of KH evolution [60], deﬁned as early (t [0, 0.25tﬁnal]), growth (t (0.25tﬁnal, 0.50tﬁnal]), mature (t (0.50tﬁnal, 0.75tﬁnal]), and late (t (0.75tﬁnal, tﬁnal]) phases, corresponding to linear instability, nonlinear saturation, fully developed turbulence, and viscous decay or equilibrium phases respectively. The entropy growth rate: = H(tﬁnal) H(t0) tﬁnal t0 , (87) quantiﬁes the rate of disorder increase for each test case, while the stage-weighted overall complexity: Coverall = wshCis, (88) XsS with weights (wearly, wgrowth, wmature, wlate) = (0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.25) emphasizing the mature turbulence phase where mixing eﬃciency peaks, provides scalar metric for comparing the four test scenarios. All post-processing computations incorporate data preprocessing to handle numerical artifacts from the solver output and ensure statistical validity. The data ﬂattening with NaN removal: φvalid = {φi,j : φi,j / {NaN, }}, (89) eliminates undeﬁned values that may arise from boundary conditions or numerical instabilities in the simulation. When dataset sizes from the high-resolution simulations (particularly Test Case 4) exceed computational feasibility for certain statistical tests, random subsampling without replacement to: Nsample = min(Nvalid, 10000), (90) points maintains statistical signiﬁcance while ensuring tractability, following standard practices in turbulence statistics where spatial correlations decay rapidly beyond the integral scale [58]. This statistical framework, implemented as separate post-processing pipeline operating on the NetCDF outputs from our four demonstration test cases, provides robust quantiﬁcation of the complex spatiotemporal dynamics characterizing KH instability evolution across the explored parameter space of Reynolds numbers (Re = 10005000) and Richardson numbers (Ri = 0.10.3) representative of diverse geophysical ﬂow regimes."

            "content": "The emergence of non-Gaussian distributions with extreme kurtosis values demonstrates the intermittent nature of stratiﬁed turbulence within these idealized conﬁgurations [7]. These statistical signatures arise from coherent structure dynamics rather than random ﬂuctuations, characteristic of the simpliﬁed two-dimensional framework employed. The pronounced negative skewness in density distributions indicates asymmetric entrainment processes, wherein lighter ﬂuid preferentially penetrates heavier layers through mechanisms documented in laboratory investigations [6]. While these idealized test cases exclude three-dimensional eﬀects and realistic boundary conditions present in geophysical ﬂows, they isolate fundamental mixing mechanisms that remain obscured in more complex simulations. The controlled parameter space enables systematic investigation of Richardson and Reynolds number dependencies without confounding factors inherent in ﬁeld observations or comprehensive numerical weather prediction models. Richardson number variations fundamentally alter the mixing dynamics through modiﬁcation of the shear-to-buoyancy ratio, as demonstrated across the four canonical conﬁgurations. The enhanced mixing eﬃciency at Ri=0.1 with dual interfaces derives from constructive interference between adjacent instability zones [15]. Vortex pairing across separated shear layers generates secondary circulations absent in single-interface conﬁgurations, amplifying cross-gradient transport beyond linear superposition predictions. External forcing paradoxically diminishes mixing eﬃciency despite elevated Reynolds numbers, revealing fundamental distinctions between autonomous instability development and imposed turbulence [56]. Continuous large-scale energy injection disrupts the natural cascade sequence, preventing formation of optimally-sized billows that maximize buoyancy ﬂux. This mechanism, observable only in idealized simulations where forcing parameters remain precisely controlled, explains observations of reduced mixing eﬃciency in wind-driven oceanic layers compared to internal shear events at equivalent dissipation rates [11]. Rotational constraints manifest through modiﬁed entropy evolution rates, conﬁrming theoretical predictions of geostrophic adjustment within the limitations of two-dimensional dynamics [50]. The imposed horizontal rigidity redirects energy into barotropic modes, suppressing vertical transport essential for diapycnal mixing. Vorticity concentration in ﬁlamentary structures, evidenced by extreme statistical moments, characterizes rotationally-constrained turbulence wherein horizontal anisotropy dominates the energy cascade [52]. While the two-dimensional formulation cannot capture baroclinic instabilities or inertial waves that modulate mixing in three-dimensional rotating ﬂows, it isolates the fundamental competition between rotation and stratiﬁcation eﬀects. The simpliﬁed framework enables direct comparison with theoretical predictions unavailable for fully three-dimensional turbulent ﬂows where analytical solutions remain intractable. Complexity index evolution delineates distinct dynamical phases corresponding to linear instability theory, validated through these controlled numerical experiments. Early-stage rapid growth follows exponential ampliﬁcation predicted by stability analysis, with growth rates maximized near the marginal stability threshold [3, 4]. The accelerated transition in multi-interface conﬁgurations conﬁrms theoretical predictions of mode coupling between adjacent unstable regions [48]. Convergence of mature-phase complexity values across diverse initial conditions reveals universal turbulence characteristics emerging from idealized conﬁgurations. The anisotropic energy cascade, characterized by horizontal k5/3 scaling and steeper vertical slopes, emerges independently of forcing mechanisms [58]. This universality, clearly observable in simpliﬁed test cases, indicates that developed stratiﬁed turbulence reaches canonical energy distributions regardless of generation pathways. The computational implementation leveraging NumPy array operations and Numba JIT compilation demonstrates the feasibility of high-resolution simulations on modest hardware platforms. The Fedora Linux system with 32 GB RAM successfully executed all test cases, with the most demanding forced turbulence simulation requiring approximately 31 minutes for 30 seconds of physical time on 384 192 grid. The fractional-step projection method maintains second-order accuracy while the FST solver achieves machine precision for the pressure Poisson equation with O(N log ) complexity. The adaptive time-stepping algorithm balances accuracy and eﬃciency, automatically adjusting between CFL and viscous stability constraints. This computational eﬃciency enables parameter studies previously requiring supercomputing resources, democratizing access to fundamental ﬂuid dynamics research. The 20 Python implementation provides transparency and reproducibility often lacking in legacy Fortran codes, while Numba optimization achieves performance within factor of two of compiled languages. Statistical distribution diﬀerences between scenarios exceed parametric test capabilities, necessitating nonparametric approaches validated through these idealized cases. Density ﬁeld distinctions across all conﬁgurations contrast with partial vorticity ﬁeld similarities, suggesting greater universality in rotation generation than scalar transport mechanisms. This dichotomy parallels three-dimensional simulations wherein vorticity statistics exhibit enhanced self-similarity compared to mixing properties [63]. Reynolds number scaling exhibits non-monotonic mixing eﬃciency relationships, contradicting classical turbulence theory but consistent with the pathway-dependent mechanisms isolated in these test cases [40]. Alternative instabilities, particularly the Holmboe mode, achieve superior mixing through asymmetric structures that enhance diapycnal transport [69]. Thermodynamic considerations reconcile apparent entropy paradoxes in vorticity evolution observed across all idealized scenarios. Local organization into coherent structures decreases conﬁgurational entropy while global dissipation increases thermal entropy [27]. This duality characterizes geophysical turbulence wherein structure formation and irreversible mixing proceed simultaneously. Current parameterization schemes inadequately represent the identiﬁed mixing dependencies revealed through systematic parameter variation in controlled conditions. Richardson number-based formulations assuming monotonic relationships fail to capture multi-interface enhancement and forcing-induced suppression [70]. Accurate subgrid-scale representation requires encoding turbulence generation mechanisms beyond instantaneous ﬂow properties [71]. The idealized two-dimensional framework deliberately excludes spanwise secondary instabilities that amplify mixing in natural ﬂows, enabling isolation of primary instability mechanisms. Three-dimensional perturbations increase mixing eﬃciency through additional overturning modes absent in planar simulations [60]. Rotational cases particularly beneﬁt from spanwise instabilities that generate helical structures capable of enhanced vertical transport despite Coriolis constraints [72]. Nevertheless, the two-dimensional results provide essential baseline understanding and computational benchmarks for more complex threedimensional simulations. The developed complexity metrics provide quantitative benchmarks for model validation beyond conventional statistical measures. LES frequently misrepresent intermittency characteristics, propagating errors into mixing predictions [16]. The composite metrics incorporating entropy, gradients, and higher moments enable comprehensive ﬁdelity assessment throughout instability evolution stages, establishing standards for future model development and validation protocols."

            "content": "This study presents kh2d-solver, Python-based numerical framework for investigating idealized twodimensional KH instabilities across diverse parameter regimes relevant to geophysical ﬂuid dynamics. The implementation successfully captures fundamental mixing mechanisms through four canonical test cases spanning Reynolds numbers from 1000 to 5000 and Richardson numbers from 0.1 to 0.3, demonstrating that modern Python scientiﬁc computing tools can achieve computational eﬃciency comparable to traditional compiled languages while maintaining code transparency and accessibility. The systematic statistical analysis reveals non-monotonic relationships between ﬂow parameters and mixing eﬃciency, with double shear layer conﬁgurations achieving 2.8 higher mixing rates than forced turbulence despite lower Reynolds numbers, indicating that instability pathways play crucial role in determining mixing eﬀectiveness beyond simple intensity measures. The developed complexity metrics combining Shannon entropy, gradient variability, and higher-order statistical moments provide quantitative benchmarks for model validation that complement conventional mean and variance comparisons, oﬀering additional tools for assessing turbulence parameterizations in climate and ocean models. While the two-dimensional framework deliberately excludes three-dimensional secondary instabilities and realistic boundary conditions, this simpliﬁcation enables isolation of primary mechanisms that may be obscured in comprehensive simulations, contributing useful baseline understanding for interpreting more complex ﬂows. The opensource implementation facilitates access to high-ﬁdelity instability simulations, enabling researchers and students with modest computational resources to investigate fundamental questions in stratiﬁed turbulence that traditionally required more extensive computing facilities. Future extensions should incorporate three-dimensional eﬀects, non-Boussinesq dynamics, and variable diﬀusivities to bridge the gap between these idealized conﬁgurations and realistic geophysical ﬂuid dynamics applications, while maintaining the computational eﬃciency and transparency that characterize the present framework."
