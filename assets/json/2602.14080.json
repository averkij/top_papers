Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amount of factual information in their parameters (Joshi et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Mallen et al., 2023; Petroni et al., 2019), yet factual errors remain persistent challenge (Haas et al., 2025; Ravichander et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2024a). While existing evaluations consider response as either correct or incorrect, accuracy alone provides little insight into the source of the error. If an LLM incorrectly answers the question Which famous band played their first gig at the Boardwalk club? (the answer is Oasis), can we tell why? One possibility is that the LLM does not encode this information in its parameters (e.g., due to limited data coverage or model capacity). Alternatively, fact may be encoded but not accessible under different conditions than how it was learned. One example is the reversal curse (Berglund et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024c), where an LLM can answer that Oasis played their first gig at the Boardwalk club, yet fails to answer who played their first gig there. Encoding and recall failures are indistinguishable under accuracy metrics, yet they imply different limitations and solutions. Encoding failures call for pre-training interventions, such as scaling model size or data coverage. Recall failures suggest post-training interventions that often improve how models utilize what they already encode Gekhman et al. (2024); Lin et al. (2024a); Zhou et al. (2023). We therefore propose shifting the unit of analysis from individual questions to facts. We introduce knowledge proCorresponding author(s): nitayc@google.com, galyona@google.com 2026 Google.

Bottom: Percentages of these profiles across selected LLMs, revealing: (1) Scaling fills empty shelves by reducing encoding failures: frontier LLMs encode nearly all facts in our data.

Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality filing: framework that categorizes facts into one of five profiles (see Figure 1), based on whether the fact is encoded, and by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can be recalled only with inferencetime computation (thinking).1 We operationalize these definitions behaviorally (Holtzman and Tan, 2025). We measure encoding by priming the LLM to complete factual proposition using context that resembles how the fact was likely to be encountered during pre-training. We measure recall2 by asking questions about these encoded facts across different contexts, including phrasings or relational orderings. This enables the study of frontier LLMs despite the inaccessibility of their weights and training data. To support knowledge profiling, we introduce WikiProfile,3 new benchmark comprising 2,150 facts, each paired with 10 questions that probe encoding, recall, and recognition (multiple-choice). WikiProfile is constructed via fully automated multi-step pipeline that employs prompted LLM grounded in web search to generate, refine, and verify questions. Unlike other benchmarks that rely on synthetic or schema-restricted knowledge-base triplets (Kumar et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2025b; Yuan et al., 2024), our facts are extracted from natural documents. This enables evaluation in more realistic settings, where facts are expressed indirectly, and may involve complex, context-dependent relations (Wang et al., 2025b). Using WikiProfile, we evaluate 13 LLMs, resulting in more than 4 million graded answers. We find that scaling primarily improves encoding, while recall remains major bottleneck. For frontier LLMs, including Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5, encoding is nearly saturated, with 9598% of facts encoded. Yet the same models still cannot recall 2533% of facts without thinking. Why do LLMs struggle to access knowledge they have encoded? Our findings suggest that recall is tightly coupled to the conditions under which facts were learned, degrading when queries diverge from training-time patterns. We manifest this through two cases: fact popularity and the reversal curse. While the encoding gap between popular and long-tail facts for frontier LLMs is small (a few percentage points), the recall gap is substantially larger (often exceeding 25%). Reverse questions reveal surprising pattern: LLMs struggle to answer reverse questions compared to direct ones, despite showing no disadvantage in recognizing the correct answer under multiple-choice evaluation. Together, our results refine prior accounts (He et al., 2025; Kandpal et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023) and indicate that both long-tail errors and the reversal curse reflect recall failures rather than missing knowledge. This perspective also refines prior work on hidden knowledge (Gekhman et al., 2025; Orgad et al., 2025): what appears to be knowledge accessible only through model internals may instead reflect encoded facts whose recall is context-dependent, such that the right prompt or context can elicit. Given that encoding in frontier LLMs is nearing saturation while substantial headroom remains for recall, future improvements are likely to come from better utilization of existing knowledge. One mechanism that already demonstrates this is thinking: our results show that thinking recovers 4065% of encoded-but-not-directly-known facts. The gains are most pronounced in challenging settings, such as long-tail facts and reverse questions. This parallels the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon in human memory (Brown and McNeill, 1966; Schwartz, 2002), in which additional effort can surface knowledge that is present but momentarily inaccessible. Post-training and inference-time methods may thus play central role in factuality by improving how models utilize what they already encode. In summary, our contributions are: (1) We propose behavioral framework that characterizes factual knowledge in LLMs by separating encoding from recall via knowledge profiles; (2) We introduce WikiProfile, benchmark for knowledge profiling, along with fully automated pipeline for constructing such benchmarks; and (3) Through evaluation of 13 LLMs on Wikipedia-derived facts, we show that the bottleneck for factuality is recall, not encoding, and that thinking helps recover otherwise inaccessible knowledge. 2. Knowledge Profiling We focus on factual knowledge as the ability to answer shortform questions correctly without external tools. Our aim is to provide systematic, model-agnostic characterization of factual behavior that applies to both closedand openweight LLMs. To this end, we introduce two complementary operational notions, defined purely in terms of observable behavior: encoding and knowledge. Together, they allow us to determine whether errors arise from encoding or recall, thereby informing different paths to improvement. 2.1. Operationalizing Encoding and Knowledge 1We use thinking to refer to inference-time techniques that elicit intermediate computations before the final answer, including both chain-ofthought (CoT) prompting and thinking-optimized LLMs. 2By analogy to human memory, we use encoding to denote parametric representation, and recall to accessing encoded facts. 3We will announce the release of WikiProfile and add link. Facts and Questions: We define fact as proposition4 involving an ordered pair of entities: subject and an object. 4Although facts are often described as subject-relation-object triplets, in our data they may involve multiple or complex relations and are therefore treated as propositions. 2 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality The roles of subject and object are determined by the source text from which the fact was extracted (e.g., Wikipedia document): the subject is the entity that appears first in the text, and the object appears subsequently. question whose answer is the object is termed direct question, while question whose answer is the subject is termed reverse question. Examples are shown in Figure 2. For each question 𝑞, we generate 𝑛 responses from the LLM and use prompted LLM grader (autorater) to compare each response to the gold answer and label it as correct or incorrect.5 Let 𝑐𝑞 and 𝑖𝑞 denote the number of responses to question 𝑞 graded as correct and incorrect. We define the question grade as the accuracy over gradable responses: 𝑔(𝑞) = 𝑐𝑞 𝑐𝑞 + 𝑖𝑞 . Encoding: The notion of encoding has been defined in multiple ways in prior work, typically referring to information stored in the models internal parametric representations. Existing approaches to measuring encoding often rely on access to internal states, requirement that does not align with our focus on evaluating frontier LLMs. Moreover, the extent to which these methods reliably capture whether model truly encodes fact remains an open question (Chen et al., 2025; Haller et al., 2025; Hase et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024b). We therefore adopt an encoding-via-memorization perspective: an LLM encodes fact if it can correctly reproduce that fact in pre-training-like context. Intuitively, successful reproduction under training-like conditions provides sufficient evidence that the fact is encoded (though it may not be known). Since encoding, under this definition, is assessed behaviorally, we operationalize it using tasks that strongly prime the model with the context in which the fact 𝑓 originally appeared. We denote the set of such encoding tasks by 𝑓 . We say an LLM encodes the fact 𝑓 if: 𝑞 𝑓 , 𝑔(𝑞) > 𝜏, where 𝜏 is predefined threshold. We set 𝜏 = 0.5 in all experiments as natural majority threshold. We show in Appendix C.2 that our findings are robust to this choice. In our setup, 𝑓 consists of two tasks. The first task is proposition completion (see Figure 2), in which the model is given the left context (the entire source text truncated immediately before the object entity), and is asked to complete the factual statement. This task directly mimics the pre-training objective for which the LLM was optimized. 5The grader may assign partially or other labels when response cannot be reliably evaluated. See 4. Figure 2 Top: We extract facts from Wikipedia, predominant source of pre-training data. Left: We measure encoding by prompting the LLM to reproduce facts within their original context, testing whether they are stored in the models parameters. Right: We measure knowledge by asking questions across varied phrasings and relational directions, with and without thinking. Notably, the answer (the object entity) does not appear in the left context. The second task, which we refer to as contextual questioning, uses the same left context but replaces the final sentence with direct question about the fact. We include both tasks because completion-based evaluation can be ambiguous for post-trained LLMs, which are optimized to answer questions rather than continue pre-training documents. LLMs may continue sentence in multiple plausible ways that do not explicitly state the target fact. The contextual questioning task mitigates this ambiguity by explicitly eliciting the target fact in question form while preserving the original source context, which primes the model. We deliberately exclude thinking from the encoding evaluation. Correct reproduction can arise not only from direct encoding but also from inference, including multi-hop reasoning or educated guessing based on other encoded facts. To avoid conflating encoding with inference, encoding is always measured without thinking. Knowledge, in contrast, is evaluated both with and without thinking. Knowledge: We say that an LLM knows fact if it can correctly answer questions about it across range of semantically equivalent contexts. This definition captures the intuition that factual knowledge should be robust to superficial changes, such as in phrasing and to alternative relational directions (Elazar et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2022; Zucchet et al., 2025). Let 𝑓 denote set of questions 3 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality associated with fact 𝑓 . We say an LLM knows fact 𝑓 if: 𝑞 𝑓 , 𝑔(𝑞) > 𝜏, The contrast with encoding is intentional: encoding uses existential quantification () because reproducing fact in any priming context suffices as evidence of storage, whereas knowledge uses universal quantification () because robust recall should not depend on phrasing or query direction. In our setup, 𝑓 consists of four questions: two direct and two reverse, each in different phrasing. This tests invariance to both surface form and relational direction. 2.2. Knowledge Profiles Given our operational definitions, each fact can be characterized along three dimensions: whether it is encoded, whether it is known without thinking, and whether it is known only with thinking. The interaction of these dimensions yields qualitatively distinct knowledge profiles. In particular, we identify five profiles, illustrated in Figure 1. Encoding Failure: The fact is neither encoded nor known, with and without thinking. high rate of encoding failures indicates limitations in model capacity or pre-training data coverage, suggesting interventions such as increasing model size or expanding the training set. Recall Failure: The fact is encoded but not known, even with thinking. This indicates that the fact is stored but inaccessible at inference time, and calls for improvements beyond pre-training, such as in post-training. Direct Recall: The fact is encoded and known without thinking. This straightforward recall reflects highly accessible knowledge, which is desirable in many applications (e.g., when integrating facts into long-form responses). Recall with Thinking: The fact is encoded but known only with thinking. This indicates that the fact is not readily accessible and requires additional computation to be recalled. This profile can be viewed as recovery mechanism for otherwise inaccessible facts. Inference without Encoding: The fact is not encoded but is known when thinking is enabled. In this case, correctness may arise from inference over other encoded facts, such It is also as multi-hop reasoning or educated guessing. possible that the fact is encoded but missed by our encoding tasks. This profile is less reliable; relying on it may promote hallucinations, and it occurs less frequently in practice. Finally, we do not define profile for facts that are not encoded but known without thinking. While such cases are possible, they occur in fewer than 0.5% of instances across all evaluated models and are likely attributable to sampling noise or grader error. We therefore exclude this profile. 3. The WikiProfile Benchmark To operationalize the knowledge profiles, we need benchmark that supports measuring both encoding and knowledge. We hence introduce WikiProfile, benchmark for evaluating and profiling factual knowledge in LLMs. Since profiling involves measuring encoding, we extract facts from Wikipedia, trusted reference that pre-training pipelines are likely to prioritize, making it both strong candidate for encoded knowledge and reliable ground truth. WikiProfile consists of 2150 facts, each with ten corresponding questions. These include two questions for measuring encoding (proposition-completion and contextual questions); four questions for measuring knowledge (direct and reverse questions, each instantiated with two distinct phrasings); and four multiple-choice variants for measuring fact verification capabilities. Examples of tasks are in Table 1. All questions in WikiProfile have single, unambiguous gold answer, enabling automatic validation with an LLM grader (see 4). WikiProfile is constructed through fully automated pipeline (Gemini-2.5-Pro with thinking; Comanici et al. 2025) that can be applied to other corpora for domain-specific knowledge profiling. Pipeline Overview: The full pipeline spans dozens of steps and fifteen prompts; here we provide high-level overview (Figure 3), with complete details and prompts in Appendix and D. All prompts in the pipeline were carefully developed through manual optimization and error analysis on held-out subset of tens of documents, from which the examples used in the prompts are drawn. Fact Extraction: To extract facts, we sample 10,000 Wikipedia pages, record their visit counts, and categorize them into nine topics (see Figures 9 and 10 for distributions). Next, we perform NER to identify entities and their types (e.g., DATE, LOCATION, PERSON; see Figure 11). For each document, we select up to 3 candidate object entities (not from the first sentences), each of which defines distinct fact. These candidates are selected based on strict criteria: an entity is suitable only if it represents non-trivial, non-guessable, and time-independent (i.e., not subject to change) completion of its left context. Furthermore, the left context must constrain the completion to single, unambiguous answer. After final verification step, we downsample to 5,000 candidates, balancing categories and entity types. Question Generation: We generate direct and reverse ques4 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 3 The WikiProfile Creation Pipeline: We propose fully automated pipeline based on prompted LLMs. The yellow boxes denote the specific prompts used at each step (see D).

Center (red and blue): Construction of direct and reverse questions via generation, refinement, and filtering (grounded by Google Search). Right (green): Creation of remaining questions (natural phrasing, contextual, and multiple-choice versions) based on the direct/reverse pairs. Facts are discarded throughout the pipeline if their associated questions are rejected. Full details in Appendix A. tions through three-step process of generation, refinement, and filtering, ensuring that each question is unambiguous, specific, minimal, and has unique answer. Direct questions are generated first, and reverse questions are then derived by swapping subject and object roles. Because our goal is to test encoding, we initially generate high-verbatim questions that closely match the source text; we then create natural rephrasings of each to test robustness to phrasing variation. Contextual questions are constructed by appending the direct question to its left context, providing maximal priming. For each question, we also generate multiple-choice variant with three plausible distractors matched by entity type and thematic similarity. All questions undergo filtering grounded in Google Search. We prompt an LLM with each question and discard cases where multiple answers are returned or clarification is needed. This filtering is strict: if any question is rejected, the entire fact is discarded, leaving us with approximately 2,200 facts. Finally, we manually validated facts and their associated questions, discarding fewer than 2% of facts and yielding final set of 2,150 facts. See Appendix A.4 for details. 4. Experimental Setup LLMs: We evaluate 13 LLMs from five families, covering commercial and open-weight models: Gemini-3 and Gemini-2.5 (Pro and Flash variants) (Comanici et al., 2025); GPT-5.2, GPT-5, and GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025b); GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini (OpenAI, 2025a); and Gemma3 (1B, 4B, 12B, 27B) (Kamath et al., 2025). Each model is evaluated with and without thinking. Gemini-2.5, Gemini-3, and GPT5 are thinking-optimized; we use default settings when thinking is enabled and set effort/budget to zero to disable it. For GPT-4.1 and Gemma3, we use CoT prompting. Response Generation: For each example (an incomplete text or question), we generate eight responses per LLM with temperature of 1. In Appendix C.4, we justify the choice of eight responses. We employ three prompts, one for each task format (completion, closed-book QA, and multiple-choice QA). Each prompt instructs the LLM to produce concise, answer-only responses (see Box D.17). For multiple-choice questions, answer choices are shuffled each time, ensuring that each option is the correct answer exactly twice. In total, we evaluate 4.5 million responses (132 LLMs2150 facts 10 tasks 8 responses). Response Evaluation: We use two prompted LLM graders (autoraters) (Wei et al., 2024a): one for the completion tasks (Box D.18) and one for the closed-book QA tasks (Box D.19). Both graders use Gemini-2.5-Pro with thinking. The graders assign one of four labels: CORRECT, INCORRECT (factual contradiction), PARTIALLY (correct but at 5 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality (5.2). Finally, we examine thinking as mechanism that compensates for these weaknesses, recovering facts that direct generation cannot surface (5.3). Due to the analysis scale, we occasionally report results for frontier LLMs only; complete results and details are provided in Appendix B. 5.1. The Recall Bottleneck We begin by examining knowledge failures, namely, facts that are not known. These correspond to two profiles: Encoding Failures and Recall Failures. Figure 4 shows the distribution of all five knowledge profiles across 13 LLMs. Encoding is saturated; recall is not. For frontier LLMs such as Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5, factual encoding is near saturation, with 95-98% of facts encoded. Yet these models fail to directly recall 2634% of the facts, or 1112% even with thinking. Accordingly, recall failures account for more than 70% of GPT-5.2s errors and larger share in stronger models, suggesting recall is indeed bottleneck. Scaling improves encoding more than recall. The Gemma3 model family illustrates this clearly. Increasing model capacity and size from 1B to 27B parameters reduces encoding failures from 85% to 23%. However, as model scale increases, growing fraction of errors shifts from encoding failures to recall failures, peaking at 33% (with thinking) and 40% (without). In this family, scaling increases what the model stores; it does not necessarily improve what it can access at inference time. 5.2. Why Recall Fails Having established that recall is the bottleneck, we now ask: what makes it difficult? To answer this, we next focus on encoded facts. We show that recall remains tied to the conditions under which facts were acquired. During pre-training, facts are encountered in specific contexts, phrasings, and orderings. When queries diverge from the training-time patterns, recall becomes harder. We examine two manifestations of this: fact popularity and question directionality. Rare facts are encoded but hard to recall. We compare facts from low-popularity Wikipedia pages (bottom 20% by page views, used as proxy for rare facts) with those from high-popularity pages (top 20%). Figure 5 presents, for the two tiers, the percentage of encoded facts and, among encoded facts, the percentage that are directly recalled. Conditioning on encoded facts isolates recall from encoding, allowing us to assess whether rare facts are harder to recall even when they are encoded. First, we find that rare facts are encoded at high rates approaching those of popular facts. Second, while the encoding gap between popular 6 Figure 4 Knowledge Profiles: Distribution of the five profiles across 13 LLMs (percentages). The black line marks potential knowledge: the fraction of facts known with or without thinking (Direct Recall+Recall with Thinking+Inference without Encoding). As shown, encoding failures decrease sharply with scale, while recall failures persist even in frontier models. different granularity; Yona et al. 2024), or OTHER (unattempted or unverifiable answers). Including PARTIALLY improved grader stability in preliminary experiments. As defined in 2.1, the question grade is computed using CORRECT and INCORRECT responses only, excluding PARTIALLY and OTHER, since assigning them weights is subjective (Kalai et al., 2025). In practice, such responses are rare (less than 5%; see Table 2). When all responses are PARTIALLY or OTHER, the fact is excluded from aggregate statistics. Alternative handling strategies yield negligible differences (see our analysis in Appendix C.1). Finally, in Appendix C.3, we assess cross-family grader consistency by comparing graders based on Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, and find 98.2% agreement. The remaining disagreements primarily involve OTHER or PARTIALLY labels, which are excluded from our analysis; thus, our results are not sensitive to the choice of underlying LLM. 5. Results Our results suggest that factual errors arise not from missing knowledge (empty shelves), but from inaccessible knowledge (lost keys). We first characterize this recall bottleneck by examining knowledge profiles across all 13 evaluated models (5.1). We then ask why recall fails, identifying two systematic patterns, fact popularity and question directionality, where encoded knowledge remains difficult to access Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 5 Fact Popularity: We compare two popularity tiers (bottom 20% vs. top 20%) in terms of encoding rates and direct recall rates (knowing encoded facts without thinking). The Δ indicates the gap between tiers. As shown, it is narrow for encoding but wide for recall. Figure 15 presents all LLMs. and rare facts is modest (e.g., for Gemini-3-Pro, 99.5% vs. 94.5%, Δ =5), the recall gap is far larger (84.6% vs. 63.3%, Δ =21.3); this pattern holds for all frontier LLMs. Reframing the long-tail problem. Prior work established that LLMs struggle with long-tail (rare) facts, typically interpreted as capacity limitation (Kandpal et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024). Our results suggest complementary picture: rare facts are encoded; however, recalling them is the challenge. Currently, the bottleneck has shifted from knowledge acquisition to utilization, and this carries practical implications: improving factuality in frontier LLMs will likely require interventions that enhance recall, not only scale. Reverse questions are verifiable but hard to recall. Figure 6 shows that all LLMs (except for Gemini-2.5-Flash) exhibit lower recall rates for reverse questions (e.g., GPT-5: 82.9% direct vs. 74% reverse). This asymmetry is consistent with the reversal curse documented by Berglund et al. (2024). Our results suggest refinement of this view. If LLMs truly lack bidirectional knowledge, they should struggle with reverse questions regardless of format. To test this, we compare closed-book generation with multiple-choice questions, in which the correct answer is presented among distractors (verification). In verification, reverse questions are no harder than direct ones: for 9 models, reverse is actually easier; for the remaining 4, performance is similar. This dissociation suggests that LLMs are aware of the bidirectional association of the fact; they can recognize the correct answer when presented with it. Their failure lies in recalling it when the direction does not match the training data. In this view, the reversal curse is recall phenomenon rather than lack of bidirectional association. Phrasing is not factor. Our definition of knows requires correctness across phrasings and directions. We verify that phrasing does not confound our results by conducting hyFigure 6 The Reversal Curse: We compare direct recall rates (knowing encoded facts without thinking) on direct and reverse questions across two tasks: verification (multiple-choice) and generation (closed-book). The Δ denotes the gap between the direct and reverse settings. We find that LLMs handle reverse questions effectively in verification but struggle in generation. Figure 15 presents results for all LLMs. pothesis tests comparing the distributions of performance under high-verbatim and natural phrasings. Across 104 hypothesis tests (13 LLMs, with and without thinking, across four task pairs) and after FDR correction, we find no significant effects (see Appendix B.3 for details). 5.3. Thinking as Recovery Mechanism We now turn to the question of what enables the recovery of otherwise inaccessible knowledge. To this end, we examine the potential of thinking to fill this role. Thinkingoptimized LLMs such as Gemini-3, Gemini-2.5, and GPT-5 models allocate additional computation to thinking by default; for non-thinking models (Gemma3 and GPT-4.1), we elicit similar behavior through CoT prompting. Thinking targets recall weaknesses. Figure 7 presents the improvement from thinking on encoded facts (i.e., recall gains), broken down by popularity and directionality. Thinking yields larger gains precisely where direct recall is weakest. For Gemini-3-Pro, thinking improves the recall of rare facts by 20.1 points, versus 11.3 for popular facts; for reverse questions, GPT-5 gains 19 points, versus 12 for direct questions. Consequently, thinking narrows both the popularity gap (from Δ =21.4 to 12.5) and the directionality gap (from Δ =9 to 2). Why does thinking help? We believe that thinking primarily facilitates recall of encoded knowledge, rather than improving factuality through inference, such as multi-step derivation from other encoded facts. Figure 8 provides evidence that supports recall facilitation: thinking recovers 4065% of encoded but not directly known facts in thinking-optimized LLMs, but only 520% of non-encoded facts. This dependence on encoding status is expected un7 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 7 Thinking and Recall: We examine the impact of thinking on recall (knowing encoded facts). On the left, we compare two popularity tiers (bottom 20% vs. top 20%); On the right, we compare direct and reverse questions. The popularity or directional gaps are denoted by Δ (no thinking) and Δ𝑇 (with thinking). As shown, thinking narrows the gaps (Δ𝑇 < Δ). Figure 16 presents all LLMs. der recall facilitation. It is also partially expected under inference, since non-encoded facts may lack the related encoded premises that inference requires. Nonetheless, our facts are single-hop, and complex deductive reasoning is unnecessary to derive the correct answer. For encoded single-hop facts, recall facilitation is the more parsimonious explanation: the model already stores the answer and need not derive it from other knowledge. We therefore conclude that thinking primarily helps models access knowledge that they have already encoded. The cost of thinking. While thinking improves recall, it is computationally expensive. Across frontier models, 10 20% of facts are accessible only via thinking. However, determining exactly when model needs to deploy thinking remains challenge. Improving direct recall could mitigate this issue by reducing reliance on such fallbacks. 5.4. Connections to Human Cognition The role of thinking in supporting recall resonates with well-studied phenomena in human memory. The tip-of-thetongue phenomenon describes states in which person is confident they know something but cannot immediately produce it (Brown and McNeill, 1966; Schwartz, 2002). Such states are often resolved through deliberate effort: thinking of related concepts, approaching the memory from different angles, or mentally retracing the context in which the information was encountered. The parallel to our findings is suggestive: encoded-but-not-known facts in LLMs may represent functional analogue, in which the information is stored but the query is insufficient to trigger recall. Thinking provides the additional computation that, like deliberate effort in humans, bridges the gap. Separately, our verification results (in multiple-choice settings, 5.2) echo the feeling-of-knowing phenomenon: people often predict they will recognize an answer even when they cannot recall it (Hart, 1965; Nelson and Narens, 1990). The dissociation between generation and verification in LLMs, where models can verify (recognize) answers to reverse questions they cannot generate (recall), mirrors this asymmetry in human memory. While we do not claim that LLMs implement human-like cognitive processes, the functional parallels suggest that the gap between encoding and recall may be general property of systems in which the conditions for storing information diverge from the conditions for recalling it. Figure 8 Recovering Depends on Encoding: We report the percentage of not-known facts that become known with thinking, conditioned on whether the fact is encoded (red) or not (yellow). Thinking recovers 4065% of encoded facts in thinking-optimized LLMs, but only 515% of non-encoded facts. This dependence on encoding is consistent with the recall facilitation mechanism. Encoding and Memorization: Our behavioral definition of encoding connects to work on memorization in LLMs (Carlini et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Menta et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a). In particular, our 6. Related Work 8 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality encoding criterion aligns with the probabilistic framework of Hayes et al. (2025). Memorization work typically focuses on privacy or data leakage concerns, whereas we use encoding-via-memorization for knowledge profiling. Latent Knowledge: separate line of work uses internal representations to argue that LLMs possess latent knowledge: facts they encode but fail to express in generation (Burns et al., 2023; Gekhman et al., 2025; Gottesman and Geva, 2024; Kadavath et al., 2022; Orgad et al., 2025). One possible reason is that the post-training phase may introduce new knowledge that undermines the use of the knowledge acquired during pre-training (Gekhman et al., 2024). Our results offer complementary, behavioral perspective: what appears as latent knowledge may reflect context-dependent recall. Facts surface when queries match training conditions (as in our encoding tasks) but become harder to access when they diverge (as in our knowledge tasks). The Reversal Curse: Berglund et al. (2024) documented that LLMs trained on is often fail to answer What is B?. Subsequent work has attributed this to the autoregressive objective (Guo et al., 2024; Kitouni et al., 2024; Lv et al., 2024), training dynamics (Zhu et al., 2024), or data asymmetries (Golovneva et al., 2024; He et al., 2025), with proposed solutions focusing on pre-training modifications (Golovneva et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025) or architectural changes (Wang and Sun, 2025). By comparing verification to generation, we show that LLMs can recognize reverse answers they cannot produce, suggesting the curse reflects recall asymmetry rather than failure to learn bidirectional associations. Thinking can mitigate the curse, providing path to improvement that prior work has not explored. Thinking and Factuality: The effect of CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and reasoning-optimized models (Marjanovic et al., 2025) on factuality remains contested. Some studies report improved accuracy via increased diversity (Wang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025), while others find higher hallucination rates (Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2025) or attribute gains to multi-hop reasoning (Zhang et al., 2025). Effects on consistency are similarly mixed, with some studies reporting improvements (Kim et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a) and others reporting degradation (Cheng et al., 2025a,b). Our work offers unifying perspective: thinking functions as recall mechanism, not just reasoning mechanism. Its effect is most pronounced under challenging conditions, such as rare facts and reverse questions. 7. Discussion In this work, we propose framework for knowledge profiling, and applied it to profile 13 LLMs across benchmark of naturally occurring facts from Wikipedia. Our results point to recall, not encoding, as the primary bottleneck for factuality in frontier LLMs. Across the models we evaluated, encoding is approaching saturation; the strongest LLMs encode over 95% of facts in our benchmark. The challenge lies in accessing what has been learned. Recall failures are not random; they concentrate on rare facts and reverse questions, conditions where queries diverge from trainingtime contexts. This pattern suggests that LLMs store facts in ways that remain tied to their acquisition, making recall sensitive to surface-level query characteristics. This shift from encoding to recall has implications beyond short-form factuality. Distinguishing between encoding and recall failures provides framework that could extend to long-form generation, multi-step reasoning, and other domains where accessing learned knowledge is critical. In the age of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and toolusing agents, it is tempting to view parametric knowledge as secondary, something RAG can compensate for. But parametric knowledge is essential for fluency, speed, and integration across contexts. Improving how models access what they already encode is therefore meaningful target. The gap between encoding and recall might be bridged through intervention during pre-training, for example, by augmenting training data with self-generated questionanswer pairs Lin et al. (2025), or during post-training, as recent studies suggest that alignment teaches models how to better utilize knowledge acquired during pre-training Gekhman et al. (2024); Lin et al. (2024a); Zhou et al. (2023). Our findings also suggest that inference-time techniques can be effective: thinking aids parametric recall, and its benefits may extend beyond complex reasoning tasks to settings where encoded knowledge is difficult to surface."

WikiProfile Full Details In this section, we describe WikiProfile and its construction in detail. WikiProfile comprises ten tasks defined for each fact extracted from Wikipedia source text; their properties and examples are summarized in Table 1. The tasks span three formats: text completion, closed-book question answering, and multiple-choice question answering. Two tasks measure encoding (proposition completion and contextual question), and four tasks measure knowledge (direct and reverse questions, each with two phrasings). Each knowledge task additionally has multiple-choice variant. WikiProfile is constructed using fully automated pipeline powered by prompted LLM, Gemini-2.5-Pro with thinking enabled (Comanici et al., 2025). Our goal is to provide framework that can be readily applied to other corpora, including domain-specific ones, enabling researchers to identify knowledge profiles and characterize LLM behavior. Prompts were developed through manual optimization on small subset of approximately 100 documents and facts, which is excluded from the final dataset. This process involved iterative error analysis and refinement. A.1. Tasks and Properties We begin by outlining the properties that guided the design of WikiProfile. Required Properties All questions must satisfy the following properties to ensure methodological rigor and enable comparison against single verifiable gold answer: Answerable: correct answer exists. Unambiguous: The question is self-contained and precisely phrased. Specific: The expected answer type and level of detail are clearly specified. Single-answer: Exactly one answer is correct. Not time-sensitive: The answer is stable over time. Controlled Properties These properties define systematic variations across tasks. By manipulating them, we examine factors that affect factual knowledge. Format: Completion, closed-book, or multiple-choice. Context: The amount of auxiliary information provided, ranging from full source context (used to measure encoding) to minimal context required for disambiguation. Verbatim: The degree of linguistic overlap with the source text, spanning exact phrasing (for completion tasks), high-verbatim questions that reuse source phrases and terms, and low-verbatim, natural user-like queries. Direction: The relational direction of the question, defined by the ordering of the entities in the source text. Tasks Each fact is represented as relation between subject and an object entity, where the subject precedes the object in the source text. The left context consists of all text preceding the object entity. We use two tasks to measure encoding: Completion: Proposition completion of the left context. Contextual: high-verbatim question posed over the same left context. Completion can be ambiguous for post-trained LLMs, which may generate plausible continuations without stating the target fact. The contextual question explicitly elicits the fact while preserving the original context, mitigating this issue. We use four tasks to measure knowledge: 16 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 9 Distribution of Wikipedia pages according to their year of creation. Direct: closed-book question, whose answer is the object entity. Direct Natural: conversational rephrasing of the Direct question. Reverse: An inverted question where the object becomes the subject. Reverse Natural: conversational rephrasing of the Reverse question. Finally, we reformulate each of the four closed-book questions as multiple-choice questions with four answer options. The distractors are designed to be plausible and realistic. These tasks evaluate sensitivity to task format and, crucially, the ability to verify facts. This shift from generation to verification probes distinct form of factual knowledge. A.2. Fact Extraction Process We aim to extract facts that are likely encoded by LLMs (to enable measurement of encoding even for small LLMs) yet remain non-trivial. Notably, we intentionally avoid extracting facts in schema-based triplet format (subject, relation, object). Our goal is to generate non-trivial questions that are not limited to simple structural relations and may involve more complex ones (e.g., What is the condition that caused Erika Nordby to spend two hours without heartbeat before she was revived?). We therefore extract facts from Wikipedia pages, which were likely key component of LLM pre-training data. We sample 10,000 Wikipedia page summaries (first paragraphs), along with page popularity statistics.6 We retain only documents with at least 50 words. The distribution of page creation dates is shown in Figure 9. Pages are then categorized into nine Wikipedia Vital Article categories.7 The distribution of the categories is presented in Figure 10. Fact extraction proceeds in three stages. First, the LLM performs NER, identifying up to eight entities per document and assigning one of 19 predefined types (Box D.2). The purpose of this stage is to generate diverse set of entities that can serve as answers. The distribution of the entity types is presented in Figure 11. Second, the LLM selects up to three entities suitable for proposition completion. Suitability is defined by whether the left context constrains the answer to single, specific, and unique correct entity, such that alternative answers would be factually inconsistent. In addition, the entity is neither time-sensitive nor trivial, making the propositioncompletion task challenging. For additional details, including exact criteria and examples, see the prompt in Box D.3. This selection step yields 33,709 candidate object entities. Third, candidates are verified using three prompts, and only those deemed suitable are retained (Boxes D.4, D.5, D.6). This verification process results in 12,031 entities (35.6%). Finally, we downsample the dataset to 5,000 entities by balancing fact categories and entity types. according to https://analytics.wikimedia.org/published/datasets/ country_project_page/00_README.html 7https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles/ 6Popularity is based on page views from 2023-02 to 2025-06, Level/3 17 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys?

Question Generation Process We use three stages of generation, refinement, and filtering to ensure that questions satisfy the required properties. The refinement stage resolves ambiguity and enforces specificity, for example, by clarifying the required answer type and adding minimal disambiguating context when needed. The filtering stage is grounded in Google Search to recall plausible alternative answers and to discard questions that admit multiple answers. We first apply these three stages to construct the Direct question. Based on the Direct question, we generate the Reverse question, which is then refined and filtered. From the Direct question, we also generate the Direct Natural and Contextual questions, which are subsequently filtered. Similarly, we generate and filter the Reverse Natural questions. Finally, we generate the multiple-choice variants. Below, we describe the three-stage process used to construct the Direct question, and then elaborate on the remaining types. Generation The Direct questions are generated by instructing the LLM to design question based on the left context such that the only correct answer is the object entity. The question uses only the information necessary for disambiguation (minimal context) while preserving exact phrasing from the source text (high verbatim). We also specify set of requirements in the prompt (Box D.7), including ensuring that the question is self-contained and does not include pronouns. We then refine the Direct questions using two additional prompts: one to improve specificity and one to enforce minimalism. Refinement The specification prompt (Box D.8) instructs the LLM to evaluate questions specificity: whether it clearly defines the required level of detail in the answer, and to revise it if necessary. The LLM should recommend rejecting question if it cannot be fixed, either because revising it would leak non-trivial clue that makes the question too easy or because the question is too vague and would require full rewrite. This stage rejected 45 questions, leaving Direct questions for 4955 facts. The minimalism prompt (Box D.9) instructs the LLM to revise question if it contains non-essential information that can be removed while preserving disambiguation and specificity. Filtering Some questions may still be vague or ambiguous, or admit multiple answers, according to sources outside the Wikipedia context. To filter these cases, we use Gemini-2.5-Pro with thinking grounded in Google Search. Each question is answered with search grounding, and prompted LLM (Box D.10) evaluates whether the question is suitable. If the grounded answer requests clarification, provides multiple possible answers, or varies by interpretation, the question is rejected. This process removes 10.6% of Direct questions. Filtering applies to all five question types: once fact is discarded due to any of its questions, it is not reconsidered. The number of removed questions is reported in the relevant paragraphs below. Reverse Questions For reverse questions, the object entity becomes the new subject, and the subject entity of the Direct question becomes the answer. Given the left context, the Direct question, and the target answer, we instruct the LLM to identify the subject entity and generate reverse question that satisfies all required properties (Box D.11). In some cases, additional information from the left context is required to ensure that the reverse question is unambiguous and has single correct answer. For example, consider 18 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 10 Distribution of Wikipedia page categories. the direct question: At which event did the film Theres Still Tomorrow premiere? with the answer The 18th Rome Film Festival. The subject entity is the film Theres Still Tomorrow. naive reverse question such as Which film premiered at the 18th Rome Film Festival? is unsuitable, since multiple films could have premiered there. The LLM should therefore incorporate additional context, such as the directors name, yielding: Which film directed by Paola Cortellesi premiered at the 18th Rome Film Festival? The LLM may also reject generating reverse question if it cannot do so without making it trivial (see the fourth example in Box D.11). This occurs in 2.2% of cases. After generation, we apply the refinement stage, which improves specification and enforces minimalism, rejecting an additional 3.6% of Reverse questions. We then proceed to filtering. Before applying Google Searchgrounded filtering, we verify that the Direct and Reverse questions form valid pair and are non-trivial, using the prompt in Box D.12. This step removes 31.5% of facts. Finally, the filtering stage removes an additional 13.1% of facts. Natural and Contextual Questions We instruct the LLM to rewrite each Direct and Reverse question as Direct Natural and Reverse Natural, following Box D.13. The Contextual question is constructed using Box D.14.8 It combines the left context (excluding the final incomplete sentence) with the high-verbatim direct question, with minor edits for fluency and to avoid redundancy. We then repeat the Google Searchbased filtering for the Direct Natural, Reverse Natural, and Contextual questions. This removes an additional 5.5% of facts, leaving 2357 facts Figure 11 Distribution of object entity types. For this figure, we grouped together some types: ARTIFACT (WORK OF ART, PRODUCT), BIO_CHEM (ORGANISM, CONDITION, SUBSTANCE), CONCEPT (IDEA, LANGUAGE, LAW), DESCRIPTOR (CLASSIFICATION, GROUP, IDENTIFIER, TITLE). for which all five question types are available. Finally, we remove facts with lengthy questions (over 40 words) or short left contexts (below 30 words), yielding 2200 facts. A.4. Manual Quality Validation To ensure high data quality, we manually validate questions by adapting the protocol of Nahum et al. (2024), which prioritizes instances in which an LLM ensemble fails. Specifically, we manually examine fact and its ten associated questions if the four frontier LLMs (Gemini-3-Pro/Flash, GPT-5, and GPT-4.1; evaluated with and without thinking) unanimously fail to correctly answer at least one of the questions, i.e., 𝑔(𝑞) 0.5. This process flagged 237 facts (10.7%). Upon manual review, we identified 43 (<2%) facts and their associated questions as low quality, and they were subsequently removed from the benchmark. To further validate our data, we examined subset of 50 facts in which three of the four models provided incorrect answers. We found only 3 errors in this subset. Together, these results suggest that low-quality questions are uncommon in the remaining data and that the benchmark meets high standard. B. Additional Results 8We do not generate contextual versions for reverse questions, as these tend to be too easy and the context often includes the answer, frequently the page title. In this section, we clarify how each analysis, figure, and table is computed, and report results for all evaluated LLMs to support the main-text trends. Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality B.3. Phrasing large body of work suggests that LLMs are sensitive to prompt phrasing (Deng et al., 2023; Habba et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2024b; Lior et al., 2025; Mizrahi et al., 2024). In contrast, in 5.2, we find that LLMs are insensitive to question rephrasing in our setup. Here we elaborate on this analysis. We conduct hypothesis tests comparing the distributions of performance across phrasings, treating success as binary variable (1 if the question grade exceeds 0.5, 0 otherwise). In total, we perform 104 tests, covering 13 LLMs (with and without thinking) and four question pairs (direct vs. direct natural, reverse vs. reverse natural, and their multiple-choice variants). After applying False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction using the BenjaminiYekutieli procedure with 𝑞 = 0.05 (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001), none of the tests are significant. This indicates that, in our setup, phrasing does not confound knowledge assessment. B.4. Reverse Questions Figure 15 reports recall performance conditioned on facts being encoded, for both multiple-choice and closed-book questions, under direct and reverse directions, across 13 LLMs. Each bar shows the fraction of encoded facts that are known under given direction and task format. fact is counted as known under the direct (respectively, reverse) condition only if the grades for both corresponding questions (direct and direct natural; reverse and reverse natural) exceed 𝑔(𝑞) > 0.5. The same criterion is applied to the multiple-choice variants. Figure 15 shows that, for all LLMs, the gap between direct and reverse questions is much smaller for verification than for generation. For 9 out of 13 LLMs, reverse verification is in fact easier. Our analysis comparing direct and reverse questions focuses on encoded facts, as this allows us to isolate recall failures. One might argue that this conditioning introduces selection bias, since the encoding tasks share the same answer entity as direct questions. We therefore conduct several robustness analyses. First, all key results replicate when we do not condition on encoding: reverse generation remains substantially harder than direct generation, the gap is much smaller or absent for verification (with reverse verification often easier), and thinking mitigates the gap. Second, we control for answer type (e.g., person, location, etc) by computing performance separately for each type and then comparing reverse to direct questions; the same trends persist. Finally, we analyze error attribution over all not-known facts and over those that are encoded. We decompose the sources of error into three categories: failure on direct questions only, failure on reverse questions only, or failure 20 Figure 12 Trends Identified by Profiles: Knows equal to the sum of Direct Recall (green line), Recall with Thinking (light green shade), and Inference without Encoding (light blue shade). LLMs are sorted according to Knows. Figure 4 presents distributions of the profiles. B.1. Profiles Figure 4 presents the profile distributions for the 13 LLMs, and Figure 12 provides line plot that highlights trends. To estimate the distributions, we exclude facts with nongradable questions (see Appendix C.1), then assign each fact profile and compute the share of each profile. The Knows value sums the Direct recall, recall with Thinking, and Inference without Thinking profiles. It therefore slightly overestimates the LLMs actual performance (with thinking enabled), since some facts become unknown when thinking is enabled. As such, Knows can be viewed as an LLMs knowledge potential. B.2. Fact Popularity Popularity tiers (bottom 20%, top 20%) are defined based on Wikipedia page visit counts for the pages from which facts are extracted. This serves as reasonable but imperfect proxy for fact incidence, and we expect the observed trends to be even stronger with more direct measure. Figure 15 compares the encoding and recall gaps between the two popularity tiers across all 13 LLMs. Encoding performance is measured as the proportion of encoded facts within each tier, while recall performance is measured as the proportion of known facts conditioned on being encoded. This conditioning isolates recall from encoding, allowing us to assess whether rare facts are harder to recall even when they are encoded. As shown, for most LLMs (10 out of 13; excluding Gemma3 12b, 4b, and 1b), the recall gap is substantially larger than the encoding gap. Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 13 We decompose errors into three categories: failures on only direct questions, only reverse questions, or both. The dashed red line marks 50%. The left bar plot shows results for LLMs without thinking on all facts, while the right bar plot shows results for encoded facts. As shown, errors from reverse questions exceed those from direct questions, regardless of encoding. on both. As shown in Figure 13, across all LLMs, errors from reverse questions consistently exceed those from direct questions. For smaller LLMs, the dominant error source is failing both questions. As scale increases, the share of both decreases, and only reverse becomes the dominant failure mode (40-50% are only reverse and an additional 15-30% are both). B.5. Thinking Figure 16 examines the impact of inference-time thinking on recall across 13 LLMs, focusing on popularity and directionality, respectively. In both analyses, we condition on encoded facts and decompose recall into baseline performance (facts known without thinking, given they are encoded) and the additional share that becomes known only with thinking. As shown, thinking mitigates the popularity gap for 8 out of 13 LLMs (excluding GPT-4.1-mini and the Gemma3 models) and the directional gap for 9 out of 13 LLMs (excluding Gemini-2.5-Flash and Gemma3 models). In both cases, the mitigation is substantial for frontier LLMs, that is, the stronger proprietary models. C. Methodological and Design Choices The goal of this section is to describe and justify methodological details and design choices that influence our evaluation and analysis. C.1. Handling Partially and Other Grades The question grade is computed as accuracy over CORRECT and INCORRECT responses only, excluding responses labeled PARTIALLY or OTHER. For example, if question receives 3 CORRECT, 1 INCORRECT, 2 PARTIALLY, and 2 3 3+1 = 0.75. We exclude OTHER responses, its grade is PARTIALLY and OTHER from grading because assigning them weights is subjective (Kalai et al., 2025). We next describe how we handle PARTIALLY and OTHER responses at the fact level. We evaluated three strategies; Table 2 reports the resulting profile distributions and the fraction of excluded facts. The first strategy excludes fact if any of its six profiling questions is non-gradable, meaning all responses are PARTIALLY or OTHER. This approach removes substantial number of facts, around 10% for frontier LLMs and over 20% for Gemma3 models. The second strategy groups questions into task pairs (encoding, direct, and reverse) and excludes fact only if an entire pair is non-gradable. This substantially reduces exclusions to 14% for nearly all LLMs, while producing profile distributions nearly identical to the first strategy. The third strategy extends the second by assigning PARTIALLY responses weight of 0.51, allowing facts to be considered known even when all responses are PARTIALLY. While this further reduces exclusions to below 1% and yields results very similar to the second strategy, it introduces subjective judgment that is harder to justify. We therefore adopt the second strategy throughout the paper. Finally, in 2.2, we do not define profile for facts that are not encoded but are known without thinking. Such cases are rare (less than 0.5% across all models; see the Direct Inference column in Table 2) and are likely due to sampling noise or grader error; excluding this profile does not change the results. 21 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Figure 14 shows the confusion matrix between the two graders. Most disagreements occur when Gemini-2.5-Pro assigns OTHER or PARTIALLY, while GPT-5 assigns definitive label. To better understand these disagreements, we manually examine them; representative examples are shown in Box C.1. In most cases, Gemini-2.5-Pro yields the more accurate label, which is unsurprising given that the prompt is optimized for it. In addition, it occasionally draws on external knowledge. Overall, since the graders agree on the vast majority of responses and the remaining disagreements primarily involve OTHER or PARTIALLY labels, which are excluded from our analysis, we conclude that our results are not sensitive to the choice of the graders underlying LLM. C.4. Multiple Response Generation For each task, we generate 𝑛 =8 responses per question for three reasons. First, our goal is to assess factual knowledge at the level of facts; single response is noisy estimator and may misclassify fact as not encoded or not known due to sampling variance. Second, because our questions are not single-token predictions, probability-based estimates are not well defined, and token-level likelihoods are inaccessible for most proprietary LLMs, making repeated sampling natural alternative. Finally, multiple responses are required to distinguish availability (at least one correct response) from robustness (all responses correct), which is part of our analysis of inference-time thinking. To assess the effect of multiple sampling and justify our choice of 𝑛 = 8, we analyze how the fraction of facts with 𝑔(𝑞) > 0.5 varies with 𝑛 across four tasks: two encoding tasks (completion and contextual) and two knowledge tasks (direct and reverse). For each task and model, we perform 1,000 bootstrap resamples, each time subsampling 𝑛 responses per question and recomputing the fraction of facts with 𝑔(𝑞) > 0.5. Figure 18 shows the width of the 90% empirical bootstrap confidence interval (95th5th percentiles) as function of 𝑛. Across the evaluated models, the interval width falls below 1% for all tasks at 𝑛 =8, indicating that the estimated fraction is stable to within 0.5%. We therefore use 𝑛 =8 throughout the paper. Figure 14 Confusion matrix between graders based on Gemini2.5-Pro and GPT-5. Entries are percentages. Overall agreement is 98.2%, with most disagreements occurring when Gemini-2.5-Pro predicts OTHER or PARTIALLY. C.2. Threshold Selection Recall that both our definitions of encodes and knows rely on threshold 𝑔(𝑞) > 𝜏. natural choice is 𝜏 = 0.5, which corresponds to correctness being more likely than incorrectness. However, the threshold is design choice, and different values can yield different profile distributions. To assess sensitivity to this choice, Figure 17 presents profile distributions for five additional reasonable values of 𝜏. While the exact proportions of profiles vary with 𝜏, our main conclusions are robust. Specifically, (1) encoding is nearly saturated for frontier LLMs, even under conservative threshold of 𝜏 = 0.99; (2) recall failures account for substantial fraction of errors, and their relative impact increases under stricter thresholds; and (3) thinking consistently acts as recovery mechanism, with over 10% of facts known only with thinking across all threshold choices. C.3. Grader Evaluation Our evaluation relies on prompted LLM grader, common practice in short-form factuality evaluation (Haas et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2024a). We use Gemini-2.5-Pro with thinking as the primary grader. The prompt is adapted from SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024a) and refined through manual error analysis with Gemini-2.5-Pro. In this subsection, we assess robustness to the choice of the graders underlying LLM by comparing our grader to GPT-5-based grader with thinking (medium effort). We uniformly sample 4,160 responses across six tasks and all evaluated LLMs. The two graders agree on 98.2% of responses. Empty Shelves or Lost Keys?

He reached career high ranking of world No . 93 on 25 September 2023. ` * Correct Output :* {{{{ Liam Tarquin Broady ; PERSON }}}} ( BROH - dee ; born {{4 January 1994; DATE }}) is {{{{ British ; GROUP }}}} professional {{{{ tennis player ; TITLE }}}} who competes mainly on the {{{{ ATP Challenger Tour ; EVENT }}}}. He reached career high ranking of world No . {{{{93; NUMERIC_VALUE }}}} on 25 September 2023. Explanation : 1. ** Liam Tarquin Broady **: This is the full name of an individual human , therefore , it as ** PERSON **. **4 January 1994**: This is specific point in time , full ** DATE **. ** British **: This word describes nationality or cultural affiliation . According to the definitions , this is ** GROUP **. ** tennis player **: This is title describing person 's profession or role . The correct type is ** TITLE **. ** ATP Challenger Tour **: This is named series of tennis tournaments , which is type of recurring ** EVENT **. **93**: This is number representing specific quantity (a world ranking ) , therefore , it is ** NUMERIC_VALUE **. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. ** Instruction End ** ** Please process the following paragraph and identify up to eight entities :** { paragraph } Box D.3: Prompt for Selecting Object Entities You will be provided with paragraph annotated with entities in the format of `{{{{ entity_name }}}} `. Your task is to select up to { n_entities } ** OBJECT ** entities for the pre - training completion task ( causal language modeling ). Each OBJECT entity should complete natural \" fill -in - the - blank \" based on the preceding text : the * left - context *. Specifically , the left - context should clearly indicate ** what kind of entity ** (e.g., person , country , or biological species ) is expected at that position . However , correctly identifying the ** specific entity value ** (e.g., \" South Africa \", \" banana plants \") should require recalling world fact . These selected entities serve as factual anchors for generating our suite of completion - based and QA - based robustness tests . ### ** Instructions for selecting suitable OBJECT entities ** 30 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality * Select OBJECT entities that involve recalling factual knowledge , and is not trivial to guess . * The left - context ( the text that precedes the entity ) must suggest ** what kind ** of entity is expected (e.g., date , country , person 's name , title , profession , species , an event , number , etc ). * The left - context should contain enough information to strongly suggest single , unique , unambiguous completion . * OBJECT entities whose specific value can be predicted solely based on the \" left - context \" or are too easy to guess are considered poor choices . * * Example :* ` Bang bang chicken ( Chinese : ...) is popular dish in {{{{ Chinese cuisine }}}} ` -> {{{{ Chinese cuisine }}}} is poor choice because the Chinese name makes the answer too obvious . * * Example :* ` Airlink is based in Johannesburg , {{{{ South Africa }}}} ` -> {{{{ South Africa }}}} is poor choice because it can be easily guessed from the mention of Johannesburg , without requiring any knowledge about Airlink . * The OBJECT should have strong relationship with an entity mentioned earlier in the text . * * Example :* `{{{{ Panama disease }}}}... infects {{{{ banana plants }}}} ` -> Knowing what Panama disease is makes \" banana plants \" highly predictable object of the verb \" infects \". * Do not select OBJECT entities from the start of sentence . Ideally , the OBJECT entity should appear at the end of sentence or complete clause . * Ensure the left - context provides sufficient disambiguation to yield unique and specific completion . If the blank could plausibly be filled by multiple entity types , it is not suitable choice . * * Example :* The left - context \" Michael Jordan was born on ...\" is ambiguous , as multiple people share this name (e.g., the basketball player and the ML researcher ). In contrast , \" Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born on ...\" and \" Michael Jordan , the famous basketball player , was born on ...\" clearly indicate single referent , enabling unique factual prediction . * * Example :* ` Liam Tarquin Broady is ... ` -> This is poor choice . The context is too broad and could be completed with multiple entities , such as profession ( tennis player ) , nationality ( British ) , or descriptor ( left - handed ). * The immediate context preceding the entity should constrain the expected entity type , strongly signaling what kind of entity is likely to follow . The OBJECT entity can follow preposition that narrows down the possibilities . * * Example :* `... born on {{{{4 January 1994}}}} ` -> The phrase \" born on \" strongly suggests date . * * Example :* `... caused by the fungus {{{{ Fusarium oxysporum f. sp . cubense }}}} ` -> The phrase \" the fungus \" clearly indicates that specific fungal name should follow . * * Example :* `The Virginia Plan ( also known as the {{{{ Randolph Plan }}}}) ... ` -> The phrase \" also known as \" implies an alternative name is expected . * Do not consider any information that appears after the OBJECT entity when making your selection . * If the uniqueness or the disambiguation of the entity type relies on information that appears after the entity , it is poor OBJECT choice . * * Example :* `It is their first album to feature {{{{ Matt Wachter }}}} on bass .` -> {{{{ Matt Wachter }}}} is poor choice . The phrase \" It is their first album to feature ...\" does not constrain the prediction . The disambiguating detail \" on bass \" comes * after * the entity , which violates the instruction that the ** OBJECT ** must be inferable solely from the left - context . * You must select up to { n_entities } suitable OBJECT entities and return them in list , sorted from the most to the least suitable . ---- ### ** Examples ** ### ** Text 1** {{{{ Panama disease }}}} ( or Fusarium wilt ) is plant {{{{ disease }}}} that infects {{{{ banana plants }}}} ({{{{ Musa spp .}}}}) . It is wilting disease caused by the fungus {{{{ Fusarium oxysporum f. sp . cubense }}}} ( Foc ). During the {{{{1950 }}}} , an outbreak of Panama disease almost wiped out commercial {{{{ Gros Michel }}}} banana production . * * * * {{{{ Panama disease }}}} - It appears in the first clause of the first sentence and is therefore ineligible . This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ disease }}}} - This entity does not require recalling world fact ; it can be predicted from the context clues \" Fusarium wilt \" and \" infects .\" This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ Musa spp .}}}} - While recalling the scientific name for banana plants is good test of knowledge , the use of parentheses makes the answer less certain . The context could also imply other related species . This choice is ** good **. {{{{ banana plants }}}} - The context \" plant disease that infects ...\" combined with the subject \" 31 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Panama disease \" creates very strong expectation for this specific plant , well - known fact . This choice is ** excellent **. {{{{ Fusarium oxysporum f. sp . cubense }}}} - The preceding phrase \"... caused by the fungus ...\" requires specific , factual answer . Knowing the fungus that causes Panama disease is clear test of world knowledge . This choice is ** excellent **. {{{{1950 }}}} - The phrase \" During the ...\" is too vague . It could be completed with many different time periods , making the answer unpredictable . This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ Gros Michel }}}} - The context \"... wiped out commercial ...\" strongly points to specific type of banana . However , it doesn 't uniquely identify the variety without further knowledge , so it 's * * * not perfectly constrained . This choice is ** good **. ### ** Text 2** Liam Tarquin Broady ( BROH - dee ; born {{{{4 January 1994}}}}) is {{{{ British }}}} professional {{{{ tennis player }}}} who competes mainly on the {{{{ ATP Challenger Tour }}}}. He reached career high ranking of world No . {{{{93}}}} on 25 September 2023. * * * * * {{{{4 January 1994}}}} - The entity appears in the first clause of the first sentence , making it ineligible per the instructions . This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ British }}}} - The left - context \"... is ...\" is too generic and does not sufficiently narrow down the possibilities . This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ tennis player }}}} - The context \"... is British professional ...\" strongly implies profession . Knowing who Liam Broady is leads to single , specific prediction . This choice is ** excellent **. {{{{ ATP Challenger Tour }}}} - The context \" who competes mainly on the ...\" points to tournament or tour . However , the word \" mainly \" introduces uncertainty , meaning the answer is not guaranteed to be unique . This choice is ** good **. {{{{93}}}} - The preceding phrase \"... career high ranking of world No ...\" creates very specific slot for number . Recalling player 's exact ranking is great test of factual knowledge . This choice is ** excellent **. ### ** Text 3** Happiness for Beginners is {{{{2023}}}} American {{{{ romantic comedy }}}} film starring {{{{ Ellie Kemper }}}} and {{{{ Luke Grimes }}}} , an adaptation of the {{{{ Katherine Center }}}} 2015 novel of the same name . The novel was adapted for the screen and directed by {{{{ Vicky Wight }}}}. {{{{2023}}}} - This entity appears in the first clause , making it ineligible . Additionally , the context \"... is ...\" is too general to uniquely predict year . This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ Ellie Kemper }}}} - The phrase \" film starring \" clearly points to an actor . However , since film can have multiple stars , the specific actor named first is not uniquely predictable . This choice is ** good **. {{{{ Luke Grimes }}}} - The context \"... starring Ellie Kemper and ...\" creates strong expectation for co - star , common structure in this genre . This requires specific knowledge about the film . This choice is ** excellent **. {{{{ Katherine Center }}}} - The crucial context clue , \" novel ,\" appears * after * the entity . Therefore , the answer cannot be predicted from the left - context alone . This choice is ** poor **. {{{{ Vicky Wight }}}} - The left - context \"... adapted for the screen and directed by ...\" clearly and uniquely signals that director 's name is required .

Use the same terms , phrases , and words that appear in the left - context . Do not rephrase or use synonyms , unless essential for grammaticality or clarity . ---- ### ** Required Output Format ** Return only the question without any additional text . ---- ### ** Examples ** 38 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Here are few examples , including explanations for how the questions were formulated : 1. ** Left - context :** Erika Nordby ( born February 2000) , also known as Baby Erika , Miracle Baby and Canada 's Miracle Child , is Canadian originally from Edmonton , Alberta known for having been revived after spending two hours without heartbeat due to ** OBJECT :** hypothermia ** Output :** What was the condition that caused Erika Nordby to spend two hours without heartbeat before she was revived ? * Explanation :* * We ask \" What was the condition ...\" because hypothermia is medical condition . This phrasing demands specific type of answer . We include \" Erika Nordby \" to identify the person the question is about , making it self - contained . We include \" two hours without heartbeat before she was revived \" because these are the key , unique details from the context that pinpoint the specific cause being asked about . We do not include the birth date or the nicknames to make the question minimal . The combination of the name and the incident of ' two hours without heartbeat ' is enough for disambiguation . All terms are taken directly from the left - context . 2. ** Left - context :** When Look in Your Eyes is the fifth studio album by singer Diana Krall , released on ** OBJECT :** June 8, 1999 ** Output :** What was the release date of When Look in Your Eyes by Diana Krall ? * Explanation :* * The phrasing \" What was the release date ...\" is precise and directly corresponds to the left - context phrase \" released on .\" The album title could be ambiguous on its own , so we add \" by Diana Krall \" for disambiguation . To keep the question minimal , we do not include the fact that it was her fifth studio album . The combination of the album title and the artist 's name is sufficient for disambiguation . 3. ** Left - context :** Celebrimbor is fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium . In Tolkien ' stories , Celebrimbor was an elven - smith who was manipulated into forging the Rings of Power by the Dark Lord Sauron , in fair disguise and named ** OBJECT :** Annatar ** Output :** What name did Sauron use in his fair disguise to manipulate Celebrimbor ? * Explanation :* * * \" What name ...\" sets the clear expectation for the type of answer required . We must include \" in his fair disguise \" and \" to manipulate Celebrimbor \" because these are the specific circumstances under which Sauron used the name Annatar . Simply asking \" What name did Sauron use ?\" would be too broad . Further information is not required to make the question unique and unambiguous . For example , mentioning Celebrimbor and Sauron is enough to understand that they are characters from Tolkien 's legendarium . All terms are taken directly from the left - context . 4. ** Left - context :** The horse - collar tackle is gridiron football maneuver in which defender tackles another player by grabbing the back collar or the back - inside of an opponent 's shoulder pads and pulling the ball carrier directly downward violently in order to pull his feet from underneath him . The technique is most closely associated with Pro Bowl safety Roy Williams . After being blamed for series of major injuries in the 2004 season , the horse - collar tackle was banned from the NFL during the 2005 off - season . The rule forbidding it is often referred to in the press as ** OBJECT :** The Roy Williams Rule ** Output :** What is the name the press often uses to refer to the rule forbidding the horse - collar tackle from the NFL ? * Explanation :* * To make the question self - contained , we must describe the rule being referenced : \" the rule forbidding the horse - collar tackle from the * NFL *\". The left - context specifies the rule is \" referred to in the press as ...\" This detail is critical . Therefore , the question includes \" What is the name the press often uses to refer to ...\" to remain faithful to the source text . 39 * * * * * * * * * Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality * * The years , the description of the maneuver , and the injuries are unnecessary for understanding the question and can be excluded for minimalism . All terms are taken directly from the left - context . ** Instruction End ** ** Please process the following left - context and OBJECT :** ** Left - context :** { left_context } ** OBJECT :** { object_entity } Box D.8: Prompt for Refining Specification You will be provided with question , gold answer , and its corresponding entity type . Your task is to evaluate the question 's specificity and precision , with respect to the gold answer , and revise the question if necessary . specific and precise question should clearly define the level of detail required in the answer . Your evaluation process should consider the following stages : ** Verification ** , ** Revision ** and ** Rejection **. ### ** Verification ** Determine if the question is specific and precise . Consider the following when making your decision : * * * * Would person with the necessary knowledge , who is familiar with the gold answer , be led to provide that specific gold answer to the question ? Does the question specify the required level of detail and type for the answer ? Is it easy to infer the required entity type of the answer from the question ? If relevant , does the question specify the required granularity of the answer ? * For example : \" What year ...\" , \" What year and month ...\" , \" What date ...\" , \" What is the name of the condition ...\" , \" Which city ...\" , \" Which country ...\" , \" Which province ...\" , \" What is the scientific name ...\". If the question is specific and precise , you can stop here and return it exactly as it is . Note that most of your inputs will be considered specific and precise . If the question is not specific or precise , you should try to revise it . ### ** Revision ** question should be revised if it is not specific but can be fixed with ** minimal changes **. valid revision must result in question that perfectly and uniquely targets the gold answer without leaking non - trivial information . Common revision techniques involve adding short , clarifying phrase or changing single word , for example : * * * * ** Specify the answer 's entity type .** This is often done by changing the question word to be more precise , e.g., `Who ` -> ` Which company `. ** Specify the answer 's required granularity or format .** This is often done by clarifying the necessary level of detail . e.g., `When ` -> `In what month and year `, `Where ` -> `In which city and country `, ` What name ` -> ` What is the scientific name `. ** Specify the units or precision for numerical data .** This removes ambiguity from the expected answer . e.g., Adding `in Celsius `, `in US dollars `, or `in millions `. ** Add qualifier to narrow the scope .** When question is ambiguous and could have multiple correct answers , add qualifier to focus the question on the single intended answer . you should not disclose non - trivial information . e.g., Revise ` What ecosystem ... `? to ` What ecosystem ** of mountains **... `? to distinguish from other valid answers (e.g., forest ). Note that ### ** Rejection ** If question cannot be fixed with valid minimal revision , it must be rejected . question is considered unfixable and should be rejected in the following cases : Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality * * The revision would leak information : The only way to fix the question would be to add non - trivial clue that is part of the gold answer itself , making the question significantly easier . The revision would require major change : The question is too vague or fundamentally mismatched with the answer , and fixing it would require complete rewrite rather than simple , minimal clarification . ---- ### ** Required Output Format ** You must return * only * string , which can be the original question , the revised question , or \" REJECT \". If the question is specific and precise as it is , return the question . If the question needs revision , revise it and return the revised question . If you conclude that the question should be rejected , return \" REJECT \". Remember , return only the original question , the revised question , or \" REJECT \", without any additional text . ---- ### ** Examples ** 1. ** Question :** What is the condition that caused Erika Nordby to spend two hours without heartbeat before she was revived ? ** Gold answer :** hypothermia ** Explanation :** The question is specific and precise . ** Output :** What is the condition that caused Erika Nordby to spend two hours without heartbeat before she was revived ? 2. ** Question :** What name did Sauron use in his fair disguise to manipulate Celebrimbor ? ** Gold answer :** Annatar ** Explanation :** The question is specific and precise . ** Output :** What name did Sauron use in his fair disguise to manipulate Celebrimbor ? 3. ** Question :** Who produced the 2020 German romantic comedy film Isi & Ossi ? ** Gold answer :** Netflix ** Explanation :** The question word \" Who \" is ambiguous , as it typically refers to person . The revision to \" Which company \" precisely targets the entity type of the answer . ** Output :** Which company produced the 2020 German romantic comedy film Isi & Ossi ? 4. ** Question :** What biodiverse ecosystem surrounds Lake Burton ? ** Gold answer :** Blue Ridge Mountains ** Explanation :** The term \" ecosystem \" is too broad , allowing for multiple correct answers (e.g., forest ). The qualifier \" of mountains \" narrows the scope to the intended answer without leaking information . ** Output :** What biodiverse ecosystem of mountains surrounds Lake Burton ? ** Instruction End ** ** Please process the following question , gold answer , and entity type :** ** Question :** { question } ** Gold answer :** { gold_answer } ** Entity type :** { entity_type } 41 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Box D.9: Prompt for Refining Minimalism You will be provided with question and its gold answer . Your task is to evaluate the question 's minimalism and revise it by removing any non - essential information . The question must be unambiguous and lead to single , unique answer , while avoiding non - essential details that are not required for the disambiguation of the core entities in the question or the answer . The primary goal is not simply to make the question shorter , but to remove information that acts as an unnecessary hint ( which helps answer the question ) but does not aid in disambiguation . Your evaluation process should consider the following stages : ** Verification ** and ** Revision **. ### ** Verification ** Determine if the question is already minimal . question is considered minimal if it uniquely leads to the provided gold answer without containing unnecessary details . Consider the following : * * * * Are all entities in the question ( people , works , events ) identified with just enough detail to be unambiguous for the purpose of the question ? For example , adding \" by Diana Krall \" is essential if the song title \" When Look in Your Eyes \" might not be unique on its own , as there may be another song with the same title . Does the question contain any superfluous words or phrases (e.g., adjectives , specific years , genres ) that could be removed without affecting the question 's ability to point uniquely to the required type of gold answer ? Does the question avoid providing unnecessary hints or clues ? hint is piece of information that makes the answer easier but is not needed for the identification of the entities or the intended answer from other possibilities . Note : Most questions are already minimal . Minimalism is not about shorter questions , but about not including details that provide hint without being essential for the question 's disambiguation . If the question is already minimal , you can stop here and return it exactly as it is . Note that many questions , even if long , will be considered minimal if all parts are essential . ### ** Revision ** question should be revised if it contains non - essential information that can be removed while preserving the question 's disambiguity , entity identification , and answer specification . valid revision consists ** only of deleting ** words or phrases . You must not add , rephrase , or reorder any part of the question . The original wording of the remaining parts must be preserved . You can perform minimal change to fix the grammar . After deleting word or phrase , you must confirm that the revised question still : 1. 2. Makes sense grammatically and logically . Uniquely and unambiguously points to the provided gold answer . Common details to remove for minimalism include : * * * ** Redundant Specifiers :** Details like specific year or genre , * if * another , more unique identifier in the question already makes them unnecessary . * Example : \" Which **1958 crime ** drama by Orson Welles featured ...\" might be reducible if another part of the question is sufficiently unique . ** Superfluous Descriptors :** Words that describe an entity but are not needed to distinguish it from other entities . * Example : Removing \"** country and gospel **\" from \"... quartet the Oak Ridge Boys ,\" as the band ' name is unique identifier . ** Leaked Clues :** Information that provides separate , related fact not essential to identifying the answer . * Example : Removing \"** defending champion **\" from \"... team contested the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals ,\" as it reveals the result of the previous year 's final . ** Important :** * Do not remove essential phrases that describe the core subject of the question (e.g., \"... based on the life of Military Commander ...\") . Do not shorten or remove official or commonly used names (e.g., keep \" Ebola virus disease \") and do not remove abbreviations . * 42 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality * Keep in mind that MOST questions are already minimal . Your goal is not simply to shorten the question , but to remove any information that is unnecessary for disambiguation and acts as an unneeded hint . ---- ### ** Required Output Format ** You must return * only * string , which can be the original question or the revised question . If the question is minimal as it is , return the question . If the question needs revision , revise it by deleting the non - essential parts and returning the revised question . Remember to return only the question string , without any additional text . ---- ### ** Examples ** 1. ** Question :** What name did Sauron use in his fair disguise to manipulate Celebrimbor ? ** Gold answer :** Annatar ** Explanation :** The question is already minimal . \" in his fair disguise \" and \" to manipulate Celebrimbor \" are both essential context to specify which of Sauron 's names is being asked for . Removing either phrase would make the question ambiguous . ** Output :** What name did Sauron use in his fair disguise to manipulate Celebrimbor ? 2. ** Question :** The film \" Sarsenapati Hambirrao \" is based on the life of Military Commander of which empire ? ** Gold answer :** Maratha Empire ** Explanation :** The question is already minimal . The phrase \" the life of Military Commander \" is the core subject of the question and clarifies which empire is relevant ( the one the commander served , the film might focus on more than single empire ). This is not an unnecessary hint . ** Output :** The film \" Sarsenapati Hambirrao \" is based on the life of Military Commander of which empire ? 3. ** Question :** What vocal part does Richard Anthony Sterban sing in the country and gospel quartet the Oak Ridge Boys ? ** Gold answer :** Bass ** Explanation :** The name of the quartet , \" the Oak Ridge Boys ,\" is sufficient identifier . The genres \" country and gospel \" are superfluous descriptors that are not needed for disambiguation . They can be removed . ** Output :** What vocal part does Richard Anthony Sterban sing in the quartet the Oak Ridge Boys ? 4. ** Question :** Which defending champion team contested the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings ? ** Gold answer :** Montreal Canadiens ** Explanation :** The phrase \" defending champion \" is leaked clue . It provides an additional fact ( that the team won the 1965 finals ) that is not necessary to uniquely identify the team that played the Red Wings in the 1966 finals . This non - essential information should be removed . ** Output :** Which team contested the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings ? ** Instruction End ** ** Please process the following question and gold answer :** ** Question :** { question } ** Gold answer :** { gold_answer } 43 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys?

Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Box D.11: Prompt for Generating the Reverse Task You will be provided with context , question , and an answer . The answer is an OBJECT entity that also completes the last sentence of the provided context . Your task is to generate * reverse question *. In this new question , the SUBJECT entity of the original question will be the answer . The OBJECT entity from the original question will become the new subject of the reverse question . The process involves three main stages : ** Identification ** , ** Generation ** , and ** Evaluation **. ### ** Stage 1: Identify the SUBJECT Entity ** Analyze the original question to identify its SUBJECT entity . The SUBJECT is the main focus of the question , and the question asks for information related to this entity . For example , in the question \" What is the capital of France ?\" the SUBJECT is \" France \". ### ** Stage 2: Generate Reverse Question ** Create new question where the original SUBJECT entity becomes the answer , and the original OBJECT entity becomes the new subject . The reverse question must be an unambiguous question with single , unique , and specific answer : the SUBJECT . It must be based on the given question and act as its reverse . The reverse question should follow these requirements : * * * * * * ** Self - contained :** It does not use pronouns or references that require outside context . ** Unambiguous and Specific :** Its phrasing is clear , avoids multiple interpretations , and specifies the level of detail required in the answer (e.g., \" What year ...\" , \" What is the name of the condition ...\") . ** Answer Uniqueness :** It must be phrased to have * single * valid and correct answer which is the SUBJECT . ** Minimal :** It includes only the essential details from the context and the original question needed to make the reverse question unambiguous and ensure the SUBJECT is the only valid answer . ** Verbatim :** It uses the same terms , phrases , and words that appear in the context and the given question , without rephrasing . ** Challenging :** The reverse question should be challenging and non - trivial to answer . The difficulty level of the original question and the reverse question should be roughly the same . ** IMPORTANT :** Although not needed in most cases , you may sometimes add information from the * context * to the reverse question , provided it is required to make the question unambiguous or to ensure the SUBJECT is the only valid answer . However , this information must be ** minimal ** and must ** not shift the focus ** of the question . It should not introduce hint or clue that allows solving the reverse question without knowledge of the core relationship between the original OBJECT and SUBJECT . The added detail should not become shortcut to the answer and should not make the question easier without helping in disambiguation . ### ** Stage 3: Determine Suitability and Rejection ** Finally , you must assess the reverse question you generated . If it fails to meet the requirements above , you must reject it . question should be rejected if it is impossible to create reverse version that is unambiguous and has single valid answer . It should also be rejected if any attempt to make it meet the requirements shifts the focus of the question or makes it trivial or easier . ---- ### ** Required Output Format ** Your output must be in one of two formats . If you generate successful reverse question , the response must be structured using the following tags : `< reverse >` and `< subject > `. Do not include any other text , explanations , or formatting . `< reverse >` The reverse question `</ reverse >` 45 Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality `< subject >` The subject entity , which is the answer to the reverse question `</ subject >` If suitable reverse question cannot be generated , you must return only the string : `REJECT ` ---- ### ** Examples ** Here are several examples demonstrating the task .

It was released in 1971 ** Question :** In what year was Gordon Lightfoot 's album , Summer Side of Life , released ? ** OBJECT :** 1971 ** Output :** < reverse > What is the name of Gordon Lightfoot 's album that was released in 1971? </ reverse > < subject > Summer Side of Life </ subject > ** Explanation :** It is likely that the singer released only single album in 1971 , making the answer single and unique . 3. ** Context :** Diabolik : Who Are You ? ( Italian : Diabolik - Chi sei ?) is 2023 Italian crime action film directed by the Manetti Bros . and based on the 1968 Diabolik comic strip Diabolik , chi sei ? by Angela and Luciana Giussani . It premiered at the 18 th Rome Film Festival ** Question :** At which event did the film ' Diabolik : Who Are You ?' premiere ? ** OBJECT :** Rome Film Festival ** Output :** < reverse > What film directed by the Manetti Bros . premiered at the 18 th Rome Film Festival ? </ reverse > < subject > Diabolik : Who Are You ? </ subject > ** Explanation :** reverse question like , \" What film premiered at the Rome Film Festival ?\" is ambiguous . To ensure unique answer , we add two key details , forming the question : \" What film directed by the Manetti Bros . premiered at the 18 th Rome Film Festival ?\". We specify the \"18 th \" edition because the festival is held annually and would otherwise have multiple answers over the years . We add \" directed by the Manetti Bros .\" to narrow the options at that specific event , ensuring single valid answer . In contrast , adding the detail \"... based on the 1968 Diabolik comic strip Diabolik , chi sei ?\" would have been incorrect because it shifts the focus . The question would no longer be about the film 's premiere but would become simple trivia question about identifying comic book adaptation . 4. ** Context :** WWWQ (99.7 FM ) is commercial radio station carrying contemporary hit radio format known as \" Q99 .7\". Owned by Cumulus Media ** Question :** What company owns the commercial radio station WWWQ ? ** OBJECT :** Cumulus Media ** Output :** REJECT ** Explanation :** reverse question like , \" What commercial radio station is owned by Cumulus Media ?\" is not suitable because the company owns many stations . Adding detail like \"... that is known as ' Q99 .7 '?\" or \"... that operates on 99.7 FM ?\" shifts the focus .
