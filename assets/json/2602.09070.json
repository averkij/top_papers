Unlike baselines that rely on surface visuals and fail to capture narrative tension or hidden subtext, our approach leverages global plot 𝑆𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 and local emotion 𝐸𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 to generate soundtracks that are temporally coherent and narratively resonant. of generative models[16, 27, 31, 41] enabling the transition from short clips to long-form video creation, the core challenge has fundamentally shifted, transcending the synthesis of high-fidelity static loops to necessitate the orchestration of complex, evolving soundtracks that maintain stylistic unity while dynamically responding to the shifting pacing and intensity of the visual narrative. Recent paradigms, while achieving impressive fidelity on short clips via strict frame-wise guidance [10, 14, 20, 26, 35, 49], encounter systemic bottlenecks when extrapolated to long-form narratives. Physically, maintaining dense frame-level attention across minutelong sequences incurs prohibitive quadratic memory costs and suffers from attention dilution, where critical narrative cues are drowned out by visual redundancy. Structurally, the absence of global semantic anchors in standard autoregressive models [1, 6, 18] leads to severe style drift, causing the musical identity to fragment Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yufan Wen, Zhaocheng Liu, YeGuo Hua, Ziyi Guo, Lihua Zhang, Chun Yuan, and Jian Wu over time. Most critically, at cognitive level, these methods rely on surface-level visual representations [12, 33, 39, 40], resulting in semantic blindnessan inability to capture the deep narrative logic, such as rising tension or resolution, which is essential for cinematic storytelling [19]. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose NarraScore, hierarchical framework predicated on the core insight that emotion serves as high-density compression of deep narrative logic. Moving beyond paradigms that depend on unstable external classifiers or expensive manual annotation, we introduce Lightweight Latent Affective Decoder designed to probe the rich semantic priors encapsulated within frozen Vision-Language Models (VLMs)[4, 45, 46]. By explicitly disentangling deep narrative cues from surface-level visual redundancy, this module projects high-dimensional video streams into compact, autonomous affective manifold. Consequently, NarraScore empowers the system to endogenously deduce evolving emotional arcs directly from raw pixels, establishing new paradigm of autonomous narrative alignment. Translating this insight into generative architecture, NarraScore employs Dual-Branch Injection strategy to reconcile global coherence with local dynamism. At the macro level, Global Semantic Anchor conditions the model on the overarching genre and atmosphere, ensuring stylistic stability. At the micro level, we introduce Token-Level Affective Adapter to modulate finer narrative tension [24, 47]. Diverging from prevalent paradigms that rely on heavy architectural cloning, we adopt minimalist projection strategy: distilled continuous affective cues (Valence & Arousal) are injected as lightweight additive bias directly into the decoders hidden states. This mechanism modulates the semantic manifold via direct additive bias, enabling precise token-level alignment while introducing negligible parameter overhead and preserving the generative priors of the frozen backbone. In summary, this work makes three key contributions to the field of intelligent content generation. First, we establish Pioneering Affective-Semantic Bridge, explicitly validating the emergent capability of frozen VLMs to distill complex narrative intents into continuous emotion curves, thus bypassing the data bottleneck of traditional recognition. Second, we propose data-efficient Dynamic Control mechanism via token-level adapter. This module enables fine-grained tension modulation with minimal training overhead, achieving precise narrative alignment without disrupting the overarching musical structure. Finally, NarraScore achieves synergistic balance between global style and local emotion, paving the way for fully automated, high-quality cinematic soundtrack generation."

Recent frameworks such as MuVi [25], VMAS [26], GVMGen [49], and VeM [38] leverage adapters to project dense video frames into latent conditions compatible with pre-trained backbones like MusicGen [6]. Although effective for short clips, these methods predominantly rely on dense frame-level attention mechanisms. This design introduces severe scalability bottlenecks: for minute-level videos, the computational cost becomes prohibitive, and the dilution of attention leads to style drift and loss of long-term coherence [37]. To address these constraints, recent works have explored specific mechanisms for long-form generation. VidMuse [37] proposes specialized adapters to effectively model both long-term and short-term temporal features, employing sliding-window inference strategy to ensure computational viability. JenBridge [44] adopts divideand-conquer approach, segmenting videos for independent scoring and stitching them via transition techniques. However, while these methods achieve acoustic continuity, they overlook the fundamental semantic shift in long-form content. Unlike short clips where static mood suffices, long narratives possess evolving logictension rises, resolves, and shifts. By treating long videos merely as extended sequences, current solutions fail to capture these dynamic arcs, yielding monotonous background ambience rather than responsive, narrative-aligned soundtracks.Consequently, enabling the soundtrack to dynamically evolve in resonance with the narrative trajectorytranscending mere acoustic continuitystands as the pivotal challenge for advancing video scoring toward professional-grade viability."

This avoidance stems primarily from the scarcity of continuous affective data and the prohibitive cost of fine-grained annotation. Yet, for long-form video soundtrack generation, such dense temporal control is indispensable for maintaining plot consistency.

            "content": "Semantically-Anchored Temporal Alignment. To facilitate robust causal reasoning over long-form sequences, our framework adopts strategy of Semantically-Anchored Temporal Alignment. This formulation leverages the architectural priors of the pre-trained backbone by employing linguistically grounded progression instead of rigid temporal embeddings. We discretize the video stream into uniform 1Hz sequence to balance narrative granularity against the computational constraints of the backbone. These snapshots are interleaved with discrete semantic clocks 𝜏𝑡 , formatted textually as Time: 𝑡s, to strictly conform to the native interleaved schema of the model. The visual tokens 𝑉𝑡 retain their spatial fidelity via the intrinsic positional encoding mechanism. This effectively reconstructs the video as linear causal sequence and establishes continuous spatiotemporal context for subsequent affective reasoning. Instruction-Driven Semantic Steering. We bridge the domain gap between generalist object recognition and nuanced affective analysis by repurposing the instruction-following interface of the Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yufan Wen, Zhaocheng Liu, YeGuo Hua, Ziyi Guo, Lihua Zhang, Chun Yuan, and Jian Wu Figure 2: Overview of our framework backbone. Rather than introducing external control modules, we optimize system instruction T𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 to serve as Semantic Primer. By prepending this primer to the aligned video sequence, we formulate the input representation 𝑋 as: 𝑋 = [T𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 , 𝜏1, 𝑉1, 𝜏2, 𝑉2, . . . , 𝜏𝑇 , 𝑉𝑇 ] (2) Functionally, 𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 modulates the self-attention mechanism to explicitly suppress the activation of low-level object enumeration patterns while activating high-level narrative reasoning pathways. This strategy steers the pre-trained capabilities towards analyzing narrative tension and emotional evolution to ensure that the extracted representations align with the affective task. Latent Affective Probing. To quantify the narrative tension distilled by the backbone, we introduce lightweight probing head designed to extract the continuous affective trajectory E𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 . Let 𝑍𝑡 𝐻 (𝐿) denote the set of contextualized hidden states corresponding to the visual tokens of the 𝑡-th frame. We first aggregate these tokens via Spatial Average Pooling to obtain holistic frame-level representation. This vector is then projected onto the Valence-Arousal plane [34] via Multi-Layer Perceptron: (cid:32) 𝑒𝑡 = Clip[1,1] MLP (cid:33)(cid:33) (cid:32) 1 𝑀 𝑧 𝑧 𝑍𝑡 (3) We freeze the massive backbone and train only this lightweight probe. This effectively distills the inherent ability of the VLM to correlate visual changes with explicit temporal progression into the specific task of affective regression and achieves high-fidelity prediction with minimal computational overhead. Optimization Objective. We employ hybrid objective function combining L2 and L1 norms to calibrate the probing head against the target affective curves. This formulation balances the convergence stability provided by the Mean Squared Error with the robustness against outliers offered by the Mean Absolute Error. Let ˆ𝑒𝑡 R2 denote the ground-truth Valence-Arousal vector for the 𝑡-th frame. The optimization objective L𝑒𝑚𝑜 is defined as: L𝑒𝑚𝑜 = 1 𝑇 𝑡 = 1 𝑇 (cid:0)𝑒𝑡 ˆ𝑒𝑡 2 + 𝜆𝑒𝑡 ˆ𝑒𝑡 1 (cid:1) (4) where 𝜆 serves as balancing coefficient."

            "content": "To bridge the semantic inference gap between visual features and musical concepts, we re-frame the interpretation task as cross-modal sensory translation. Instead of relying on raw visual features, we leverage the reasoning priors of the VLM to identify the visual scene while exclusively describing the implied auditory imagery. This strategy achieves modality decoupling by explicitly suppressing references to specific visual objects and cinematography. It forces the model to abstract away from scene-specific visual nouns and project the content directly into acoustic descriptors semantically aligned with the downstream audio synthesis model [6].To guarantee robustness and consistency, we employ structured instruction paradigm rather than free-form generation. We impose strict schema that compels the VLM to synthesize unified natural language description encompassing four essential musical dimensions: genre and stylistic context, instrumentation and timbral texture, emotional atmosphere, and rhythmic pacing. By projecting the visual content onto this predefined semantic subspace, we significantly reduce output variance and mitigate the ambiguity often associated with open-ended captioning.

Explicit Semantic Bridging. The global semantic anchor S𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 is integrated directly into the acoustic decoder via the pre-trained cross-attention mechanism. By utilizing the derived semantic description as the conditioning context, we steer the generative trajectory toward the target genre and atmosphere identified in the visual analysis phase. This standard conditioning approach ensures that the fundamental musical structure and instrumentation align with the narrative intent while preserving the original synthesis capabilities of the backbone without requiring invasive architectural modifications. Dense Affective Projection. structural challenge in narrative alignment lies in the significant resolution discrepancy between the sparse visual emotion cues and the dense acoustic tokens. Directly injecting these sparse signals can lead to stepped and unnatural transitions in the musical output. To resolve this, we introduce Temporal Super-resolution Adapter F𝜙 . This module first performs linear interpolation to align the discrete affective trajectory E𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 with the target acoustic sequence length. Subsequently, stack of dilated temporal convolutions[2] is applied to smooth local jitter and expand the receptive field. This ensures that instantaneous emotional shifts are translated into fluid musical evolution. Formally, the dense control signal 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 R𝑇𝑎 𝐷 is derived as: 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 = F𝜙 (Interp(E𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 )) (5) where F𝜙 acts as learnable mapping function that projects the 2-dimensional Valence-Arousal manifold into the 𝐷-dimensional latent space of the acoustic decoder. Token-Level Control Injection. To incorporate the dense affective features into the pre-trained backbone, we employ residual modulation strategy [47]. Informed by observations in prior studies regarding the hierarchical distribution of information in music generation models [24], we restrict the injection of the control signal 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 exclusively to the shallow Transformer blocks. This design choice implies that early layers are utilized to align the generation trajectory with the continuous affective constraints, thereby allowing the deeper layers to focus on the optimization of acoustic fidelity and harmonic coherence without interference. Formally, we apply learnable additive bias to the hidden states ℎ (𝑙 ) at time step 𝑡 𝑡 and layer 𝑙: ℎ (𝑙 ) 𝑡 𝑡 + 𝛾 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙,𝑡, 𝑙 {1, . . . , 𝐿𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 } = ℎ (𝑙 ) (6) Here, 𝛾 is learnable scalar initialized to zero to ensure the model retains its original distribution at the start of training. This selective injection scheme balances the trade-off between control precision and audio quality. Optimization Objective. To train the adapter module, we adhere to the native learning objective of the acoustic backbone. Keeping all parameters of the pre-trained autoregressive decoder frozen, we strictly optimize the adapter parameters 𝜙 and the gating scalars 𝛾 using the standard autoregressive modeling objective. The process minimizes the Cross-Entropy loss between the predicted probability distribution and the ground-truth acoustic tokens, formulated as: L𝑔𝑒𝑛 = 1 𝑇𝑎 𝑇𝑎 𝑡 =1 log 𝑝 (𝑎𝑡 𝑎<𝑡 , S𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙, 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 ) (7) During the inference stage, the model utilizes the learned adapter to guide the backbone in generating the sequence of discrete acoustic tokens, which are subsequently reconstructed into the continuous high-fidelity waveform via the EnCodec [8] decoder."

Prior to sequential processing, we derive the global semantic anchor S𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 by leveraging the keyframe extraction capability of the VLM. This mechanism compresses the long-form visual content into sparse sequence of representative frames and allows the model to perform holistic reasoning over the entire narrative arc within limited context window. By distilling the global context into unified stylistic description, we ensure that the subsequent music generation maintains consistent thematic identity throughout the video duration. Continuous Affective Reasoning. In contrast to the global analysis, the extraction of local affective cues necessitates high temporal density. Consequently, we explicitly eschew temporal compression strategies to prevent the loss of fine-grained narrative dynamics and employ instead an overlapping sliding-window approach to extract the frame-level affective trajectory. The input video is processed in sequential windows that share defined intersection. By utilizing this temporal overlap, we ensure that the prediction for the current window is contextually aligned with the preceding frames. This continuation approach guarantees that the extracted Valence and Arousal values evolve smoothly across window boundaries and effectively yields continuous emotional curve despite the segmented processing. Autoregressive Acoustic Continuation. Similarly, the acoustic synthesis stage operates within this sliding-window framework. We maintain the global semantic anchor S𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 as stationary condition to preserve the overarching stylistic foundation while the dynamic narrative progression is governed by the continuous flow of the adapter signals. To ensure musical coherence at the overlap regions, we utilize the final sequence of acoustic tokens generated in the preceding window as the prompt prefix for the current window. This technique prompts the model to logically extend the musical phrase from the previous context. It guarantees seamless rhythmic continuity and acoustic causality throughout the long-form video."

We utilize publicly available benchmark datasets designed for continuous affective content analysis to train the videoto-emotion and emotion-to-music modules respectively. For the video-to-emotion prediction task, we employ continuous movie dataset designed for induced emotion prediction, which provides frame-level Valence-Arousal annotations capturing the emotional responses elicited in viewers during film watching. Unlike facial expression datasets that capture actors portrayed emotions, this dataset annotates the holistic atmosphere and narrative tension perceived by audiencesprecisely the type of induced affect required for background music generation. This alignment with the viewers internal state is essential for generating background music that matches the narrative atmosphere. For the emotion-to-music generation task, we utilize music emotion dataset annotated for dynamic affective content, comprising excerpts and full songs with dense per-second valence-arousal labels. This dataset enables learning the mapping from emotional trajectories to musical characteristics, where continuous shifts in valence and arousal correspond to changes in harmony, tempo, and instrumentation. To ensure the model learns to control emotion independently of specific instrumentation, we aggregate metadata including genre and tags into textual captions. These captions are used as conditioning prompts during fine-tuning to decouple the representation of emotion from genre-specific stylistic conventions. We apply unified preprocessing pipeline to both datasets. The source separation model Demucs [9] is utilized to suppress vocal tracks and isolate the instrumental background. We segment the continuous media streams into 30-second clips with 15-second overlap to preserve temporal context. For the music generation task, we further refine the training set by discarding samples where the silence ratio exceeds 40%. Following these procedures, the effective dataset sizes are approximately 884 minutes for the video dataset and 1351 minutes for the music dataset. Ethical Considerations. This research is conducted solely for academic and scientific purposes. The proposed method and experimental results are intended to advance the understanding of video-music alignment and affective computing. This work is not integrated into any commercial products or production systems. Implementation Details. Our framework integrates the pretrained VideoLlama-3 [45] visual backbone and the MusicGenSmall [6] acoustic decoder. The architecture incorporates two trainable modules to facilitate feature alignment, namely the Projector and the Temporal Adapter.The Projector serves as semantic interface. It accepts the extracted visual features 𝐹𝑣 R𝑇 𝐷𝑣 where 𝐷𝑣 denotes the visual embedding dimension. two-layer MLP with GELU activation maps 𝐹𝑣 to the acoustic feature space R𝑇 𝐷𝑎 . We apply dropout rate of 0.1 during this projection to regularize the mapping process. The Temporal Adapter models long-term affective dependencies. It utilizes dilated convolution layer on the sequence dimension to expand the temporal receptive field. This operation maintains the channel dimension 𝐷𝑎 and is followed by LeakyReLU activation and linear layer to produce the final condition embeddings 𝐶 R𝑇 𝐷𝑎 . We employ two-stage training strategy to ensure stability. The Projector is first trained for 150 epochs to align the static semantic features from 𝐷𝑣 to 𝐷𝑎. Subsequently, the Adapter is fine-tuned for 50 epochs to capture temporal dynamics. Baselines. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we benchmark NarraScore against diverse set of five representative approaches spanning different generative paradigms. We first include M2UGEN [28] and video2music [20] as foundational multimodal frameworks that serve as established benchmarks in the field. To assess performance against the current state-of-the-art, we compare our method with VidMuse and GVMGEN, both of which represent the latest advancements in synchronized video-music synthesis. Furthermore, we construct strong two-stage pipeline baseline named Caption2Music to evaluate the efficacy of disjoint modality processing. This baseline explicitly utilizes VideoLlama3-2B to generate detailed visual captions, which subsequently prompt MusicGen for audio synthesis. Including this cascaded model allows us to rigorously validate whether our proposed hierarchical injection strategy outperforms naive combination of state-of-the-art vision and audio models.

This validates the effectiveness of our design in handling extended temporal dependencies, preserving consistent global musical identity while adaptively responding to local visual cues. Further analysis elucidates the specific limitations inherent in competing paradigms. The pipeline baseline, Caption2Music, highlights the limitations of text-only control, where coarse captions may capture the general mood but lack the temporal granularity required for fine-grained emotional transitions. Similarly, MIDI-based baselines such as Video2Music expose dichotomy between acoustic fidelity and narrative alignment; despite receiving high ratings for audio texture, these tracks are frequently characterized by users as generic and weakly coupled to the visual storyline. Consequently, while short-term settings naturally narrow the performance gap by reducing the burden of long-range consistency, the sustained top ranking of our method across all metrics underscores that structural and affective coherence remain the defining factors in successful narrative music generation."

The experimental results reveal distinct behaviors of the\nHolistic Musical Conceptualization (HMC) module across different\nscales of vision-language backbones. When employing lightweight\nVLMs as the captioner, the absence of HMC leads to noticeable per-\nformance degradation, as the model tends to produce literal descrip-\ntions of visual scenes without establishing meaningful connections\nto musical elements. However, an interesting phenomenon emerges\nwhen switching to powerful large-scale VLMs: the HMC module\nappears to constrain rather than enhance the model’s capabilities.",

This suggests that advanced VLMs possess inherent cross-modal understanding abilities that allow them to directly infer appropriate musical characteristics from visual content without explicit highlevel guidance. Regarding the adaptive in-attention mechanism, the results demonstrate that the 75% injection ratio employed in NarraScore represents an optimal balance. Both reducing and increasing this proportion adversely affect performance, indicating that excessive narrative guidance may overwhelm the acoustic modeling capacity of the diffusion backbone while insufficient injection fails to provide adequate semantic alignment. Furthermore, the consistent improvements brought by the Narrative-Aware Affective Reasoning (NAR) mechanism across all backbone configurations validate its effectiveness as model-agnostic component. Even when equipped with state-of-the-art VLMs, the incorporation of NAR continues to enhance music quality by bridging the affective gap between visual narratives and auditory expressions, underscoring the importance of explicit emotional reasoning in video-to-music generation tasks."

As illustrated in Figure 4, the spectral\narchitectures reveal fundamental differences in how each frame-\nwork internalizes temporal dynamics and semantic logic. Specif-\nically, the Mel-spectrum of caption2music is dominated by exces-\nsively smooth horizontal energy bands with a notable absence of\nvertical transients. This spectral stagnation indicates a lack of rhyth-\nmic pulses and dynamic fluctuations, which results in audio that\nfails to reflect the temporal energy shifts inherent in the video. In\ncontrast, gvmgen exhibits significant discontinuities in its spectral\nmanifold characterized by fragmented energy distributions and\nabrupt temporal breaks. Such erratic spectral patterns suggest a\nfailure in maintaining long-term acoustic coherence and a mis-\nalignment with the narrative progression of the visual input. The\nresults from v2m further highlight these challenges because its\nspectrum appears overly monotonic and mechanical. The absence\nof structured harmonic variations and distinct beat markers implies\na deficiency in narrative expression where the model produces a\nflat auditory output that remains unresponsive to visual climaxes.\nFurthermore, while vidmuse generates content with high spectral",

This is visualized as disordered pixel-like artifacts, which suggests that vidmuse is confined to literal object-level associations instead of synthesizing cohesive and narratively-driven soundtrack. In contrast, our model demonstrates superior spectral hierarchy that balances harmonic stability with rhythmic precision. The presence of clear fundamental frequencies alongside vertical onset markers indicates that our method successfully synchronizes discrete rhythmic events with the narrative arc. By capturing both the instantaneous motion cues and the global semantic flow, our model generates music that is not only acoustically clear but also contextually and emotionally resonant with the video content.
