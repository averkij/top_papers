Despite their impressive capabilities, the static nature of their internal knowledge often leads LLMs to experience hallucinations and information staleness in knowledgeintensive scenarios [123]. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by empowering LLMs to reason with retrieved relevant knowledge, thereby improving the reliability of generated answers [15, 17, 31, 42, 45, 52, 87]. However, with the explosive growth of web information, the static RAG workflow limits effective interaction between LLMs and search engines, resulting in significant bottlenecks in open-domain web exploration. To overcome these challenges, series of LLM-based web agents have emerged [22, 50, 51]. These agents perform on-demand web searches during reasoning and strategically interact with external tool environments, achieving reliable, in-depth web information seeking [6, 16, 30, 40, 48, 82, 127]. To strive for efficient training of web agents, early implementations focus on distill tool-use trajectories from stronger models and guide weaker models through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) [23, 28, 46, 116]. However, relying solely on SFT struggles to discover autonomous and generalizable tool-use capability [10]. As largescale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) demonstrates the potential to unlock frontier LLM capabilities [29, 91, 94], several web-search agents adopt trajectory-level RL [76, 118, 124] combined with carefully designed reward functions to elicit agentic reasoning in LLMs [13, 105]. While effective to some extent, this line of work consistently overlooks the multi-turn interactive nature between LLMs and tool environments [122], making it difficult to discover step-level tool-use behaviors during RL training. To mitigate this limitation, recent efforts in agentic RL have shown that web agents often display high entropy in their output tokens due to uncertainty about the external tool-call results [14]. Drawing on this finding, they introduce tree-structured rollout method that adaptively branches at high-entropy tool-call steps, effectively broadening sampling diversity and coverage [25, 38, 54, 57]. WWW 26, April 1317, 2026, Dubai, UAE Dong et al. Figure 2: Two high-entropy challenges in agentic RL. (1) High-Entropy Rollout Collapse: Over-branching at high-entropy steps along specific paths, limiting exploration of other potential correct branches; (2) High-Entropy Token Gradient Clipping: Consistent clipping of high-entropy token gradients during policy updates hinders learning effective exploration behaviors. Although these entropy-driven agentic RL algorithms stimulate exploration of latent tool-use behaviors, such high-entropy signals further pose two extra challenges for web agent training: (1) High-entropy Rollput Collapse: During the rollout phase, high-entropy tool-call steps often occur consecutively, leading the LLM to over-branch along single trajectory under highentropy guidance. This situation depletes the branching budget for other trajectories at high-entropy steps, ultimately limiting the diversity and scope of rollout sampling (see Figure 2 (left)). (2) High-entropy Token Gradient Clipping: The tree-structured rollout strategy encourages LLMs to explore step-level tool-use behaviors, thus preserving valuable high-entropy tokens. However, vanilla RL algorithms aggressively clip high-entropy tokens gradient during policy update phase, leading to the premature termination of the LLMs exploration (see Figure 2 (right)). Consequently, efficiently balancing entropy in agentic RL remains fundamental challenge in the pursuit of generalized agent training. To address these challenges, we propose Agentic EntropyBalanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an entropy-balanced agentic RL algorithm designed for training multi-turn web agents. Unlike traditional entropy-driven RL approaches [14, 55], AEPO focuses on balancing and rationalizing rollout branching and policy updates under the guidance of high-entropy tool calls, thereby achieving more stable RL training. Specifically, we pioneer the quantification of two inherent entropy-driven challenges on agentic RL. Building on these insights, AEPO introduces two key algorithmic optimizations: (1) Dynamic Entropy-balanced Rollout Mechanism: To mitigate High-entropy Rollout Collapse issue, AEPO initially proposes the entropy pre-monitoring to adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget, ensuring balanced exploration across the tree-structured rollout. Moreover, it incorporates branch penalty strategy for consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to effectively address over-branching issues in specific chains. (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization: Draw inspiration from recent clipping-optimized works [3, 84], we intuitively integrate stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term during policy updates to tackle the High-Entropy Token Gradient Clipping. This preserves and properly rescales gradients of high-entropy tokens during backpropagation while leaving the forward pass unchanged. Furthermore, AEPO proposes entropy-aware advantage estimation, integrating entropy advantage into vanilla advantage estimation, enabling the model to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 14 datasets covering deep information seeking, knowledge-intensive reasoning, and computational reasoning. As shown in Figure 1, the results show that AEPO consistently outperforms mainstream RL algorithms in generalized reasoning tasks. Remarkably, with only 1𝑘 RL training samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on HLE and 43.0% on WebWalkerQA for Pass@1; and 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanitys Last Exam and 70.0% on WebWalkerQA for Pass@5. Further analysis confirms that AEPO effectively broadens sampling diversity during rollouts while maintaining high and stable policy entropy throughout RL training, providing promising solution for developing general web agents. In summary, the key contributions are as follows: We systematically reveal two entropy-driven issues inherent to agentic RL: High-Entropy Rollout Collapse and High-Entropy Token Gradient Clipping. Through preliminary experiments, we quantify their impact on multi-turn web-agent training, offering empirical evidence for further research into entropy balancing. We propose Dynamic Entropy-Balanced Rollout mechanism, which adaptively allocates rollout sampling budgets via entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy steps to prevent over-branching issues. We introduce Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization, which intuitively integrates stop-gradient operation into the highentropy clipping term to preserve and rescale gradients on highentropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Experiments on 14 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AEPO consistently outperforms mainstream RL algorithms in web agent training. Quantitative analyses across dimensions such as Pass@k sampling, rollout diversity, tool-call efficiency and entropy dynamics verify AEPOs strong scalability and stability, offering valuable insights for developing general web agents."

We select ARPO [14] as the backbone algorithm, representative entropy-guided agentic RL method, and train with its default 1𝑘 training samples. We further quantify: (i) the steps in each sampled trajectory that exhibit consecutive high-entropy tool usage; (ii) within each rollout batch (branching budget is 8), the number and probability of trajectories that contain high-entropy branches. As shown in Figure 3 (left), our key findings are: (i) High-entropy toolcall turns exhibit transitivity: the proportion of consecutive high-entropy tool-call turns (56.5%) exceeds isolated high-entropy turns (43.5%), with trajectories reaching up to 6 consecutive high-entropy turns. This indicates that high-entropy tool-call rounds often occur consecutively. (ii) Rollout branch collapse: 93.4% of branches concentrate on 13 trajectories, while the remaining trajectories receive virtually no budget for high-entropy branch sampling. This shows an imbalanced allocation of rollout branching resources. We argue two observations are tightly coupled: Due to an excessive number of consecutive high-entropy rounds in specific samples, the model tends to over-branch on few trajectories during the rollout phase. We define this issue as the High-Entropy Rollout Collapse. 2.2.2 Problem-2: High-Entropy Token Gradient Clipping. Under the same setup as previous experiment, we further visualize the policy update phase of ARPO, including (i) the importance sampling ratio of tokens in trajectories;1 (ii) comparison of the Top-10 gradient-clipped tokens between ARPO and DAPO during training step, with clipping thresholds of 0.2 and 0.28. As illustrated in Figure 3 (right), we identify the following insights: (i) Consistent with findings in single-turn RL efforts [9, 58], tokens related to logical transitions, connections, and reflections typically exhibit high entropy. Beyond this, specific tool-call tokens also show high entropy. These tokens are highly functional and have low contextual dependency, incentivizing the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and tool-use patterns. (ii) Vanilla RL method uniformly clip the gradients of high-entropy tokens without distinguishing whether they include valuable exploratory behaviors. Although DAPO adopt clip-higher strategy [118] to alleviates this by increasing the threshold, the clipping distribution remains similar and the clipped token count is still substantial. Moreover, we empirically find that significant gradient clipping emerges in the very first policy update, resulting in lack of gradient support for high-entropy exploratory tokens in early training. This leads to fixed paradigmatic reasoning, hindering the LLM to explore tooluse patterns. We define this issue as the High-entropy Token Gradient Clipping."

            "content": "3.1.1 Entropy Pre-Monitoring. Traditional tree-based rollout empirically allocate resources for global and branch exploration without theoretical support [14, 38, 55, 114]. Inspired by information bottleneck theory [96], we advocate the allocation of global and partial branching exploration resources from the perspective of maximizing information gain. Specifically, given total rollout sampling budget of 𝑘, which includes 𝑚 global samples and 𝑘 𝑚 high-entropy partial branch samples, we simply model the sampling information gain 𝐼Gain per rollout step as: 𝐼Gain = 𝑚 𝐼root (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) (cid:124) Gloabal + (𝑘 𝑚) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Partial (cid:124) 𝐼tool. (3) Here, 𝐼root and 𝐼tool represent the information gain from the input question and external tool-call result. In the autoregressive decoding process of language model, the information gain of the question is typically measured by the token entropy decoded by the model, with informative questions generally leading to greater uncertainty [8, 130]. Therefore, we derive the following positive correlation: 𝐼Gain 𝑚 𝐻root (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) Gloabal , where 𝐻 avg + (𝑘 𝑚) 𝐻 avg tool (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) Partial (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:124) tool = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝐻 𝑖 tool, (4) where 𝐻root and 𝐻 𝑖 represent the entropy of the question and the entropy introduced by the 𝑖-th tool call, respectively. Based on the formula, we tool reveal that: (1) When 𝐻root 𝐻 𝑎𝑣𝑔 > 0, the uncertainty from the initial question surpasses that from the subsequent tools. In this case, we should increase 𝑚 to enhance global exploration, thereby boosting the information gain 𝐼Gain. (2) Conversely, when 𝐻root 𝐻 𝑎𝑣𝑔 < 0, 𝑚 should be decreased to allocate more budget to branch exploration via tool calls. tool tool Based on the above theoretical analysis, we propose the entropy premonitoring phase. As shown in Figure 4(a), we first allow the LLM to generate complete tool-integrated trajectory for the input 𝑞. Following ARPOs entropy calculation [14], we compute the question and tool average entropies for each trajectory according to Equation (4), forming the entropy matrices 𝐻root and 𝐻 𝑎𝑣𝑔 tool R1𝑘 . Subsequently, by comparing the 𝐻root and 𝐻tool, we dynamically determine the global sampling count 𝑚 as: 𝑚 = 𝑘 𝜎 (cid:16) 𝛽 (𝐻root 𝐻 𝑎𝑣𝑔 tool ) (cid:17) , (5) where 𝜎 (𝑥 ) is the sigmoid function, and 𝛽 controls sensitivity. The value of 𝑚 is positively correlated with the entropy gap between the question and the tools. As result, AEPO dynamically allocates rollout sampling resources, thereby enabling efficient sampling. 3.1.2 Entropy-Balanced Adaptive Rollout. After entropy pre-monitoring, we introduce the main entropy-balanced adaptive rollout phase to penalize consecutive high-entropy branch sampling, which comprises three core steps: (1) Entropy Variation Monitoring: Following resource allocation from the pre-monitoring phase, the LLM generates 𝑚 global trajectory-level samples for the query 𝑞, recording the initial entropy matrix 𝐻root for each trajectory. After each tool-call step 𝑡 , the real-time entropy of the models output is continuously monitored and represented as step-level entropy matrix 𝐻𝑡 R1𝑘 . The standardized entropy variation relative to the initial entropy is then computed as Δ𝐻𝑡 = Normalize(𝐻𝑡 𝐻root ), where the normalization involves dividing the sum of all values in Δ𝐻 by the vocabulary size 𝑉 . (2) Entropy-Balanced Beaming: Unlike traditional entropy-guided branch sampling [14, 126], AEPO promotes adaptive exploration that showcases beneficial entropy changes in tool-call steps while also constraining consecutive high-entropy branch sampling in specific chains. As shown in Figure 4(b), we introduce consecutive branch penalty strategy. Given tool-call step 𝑡 , the number of consecutive high-entropy branches 𝑙 prior to Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization WWW 26, April 1317, 2026, Dubai, UAE step 𝑡 for each chain is tracked, then defining the branch sampling probability at step 𝑡 as follows: 𝑃𝑡 = (𝛼 + 𝛾 Δ𝐻𝑡 ) (1 ˆ𝑃 (𝑙 ) ), where 𝛼 is the base sampling probability and 𝛾 is the entropy stabilization factor. ˆ𝑃 (𝑙 ) is linear function related to 𝑙. 𝑃𝑡 decreases as the number of consecutive branching steps 𝑙 increases, implementing consecutive branching penalty. This design makes the tree-structured rollout sampling more diverse, allowing for more comprehensive coverage of the problem-solving space. We then define the rollout branching action at step 𝑡 as: (6) Action(𝑃𝑡 ) = (cid:40)Branch(𝑍 ), Continue, if 𝑃𝑡 > 𝜏, otherwise. (7) When 𝑃𝑡 exceeds the predetermined threshold 𝜏, Branch(𝑍 ) is initiated, creating 𝑍 partial braching reasoning paths from the current node; otherwise, the current trajectory continues. (3) Termination Conditions: Finally, our iterative rollout process terminates when one of the following conditions is met: (a) If the total number of branch paths 𝑍 reaches the partial sampling budget 𝑘 𝑚, branching stops and sampling continues until the final answer is generated; (b) If all paths terminate before reaching 𝑘 𝑚, then 𝑘 𝑚 𝑍 additional trajectory-level samples are added to satisfy condition (a). Through the dynamic entropy-balanced rollout, AEPO ensures the diversity of sampling branches while adaptively allocating exploration resources, thus addressing the \"High-entropy Rollout Collapse\" issue. The algorithm of dynamic entropy-balanced rollout is detailed in Algorithm 1."

            "content": "3.2.1 Entropy Clipping-Balanced Mechanism. Unlike traditional methods that entirely discard gradients outside the clipping range [14, 76], AEPO introduces an innovative high-entropy clipping-balanced mechanism. The core idea is to retain high-entropy gradients that exceed the clipping interval, allowing the model to learn valuable exploratory token signals. Motivated by GPPO [84], we integrate stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term of the policy update phrase, decoupling forward and backward propagation. Our mechanism ensures that forward propagation remains unchanged, while protecting the gradient backward of high-entropy tokens from clipping constraints. For instance, in GRPO [76], given an input question 𝑥 and policy model 𝑦, GRPO enables the reference policy 𝜋ref to generate group of 𝐺 outputs {𝑦1, 𝑦2, . . . , 𝑦𝐺 } and optimizes the policy by maximizing: 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 (cid:19) 𝑗 = 𝑡 =1 min = E𝑥 1 + 𝜖ℎ sg(𝛿 ) (cid:18) 𝛿, 1 𝜖𝑙 , (cid:18) 𝛿 𝐴 (𝑡 ) , clip 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 (cid:19) (8) where 𝛿 = 𝑟 ( 𝑗 ) (𝜃 ) represents the importance sampling ratio, and 𝑠𝑔 () denotes the stop-gradient operation. It is noteworthy that the value of the term 𝛿 𝑠𝑔 (𝛿 ) always equals 1, ensuring that AEPOs forward computation remains unchanged. For the backpropagation, AEPOs gradient update process is formulated as: 𝐴(𝑡 ) 𝛿 , 𝑡 𝜃 = E𝑥 (cid:20) 1 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 (cid:205)𝑇𝑗 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑡 =1 F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) 𝜙𝜃 (cid:0)𝑎 𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 (cid:1) 𝐴 (𝑡 ) (cid:21) , where F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 0, 𝛿, if 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ and 𝐴 (𝑡 ) > 0, if 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℎ and 𝐴(𝑡 ) < 0, otherwise .

In other cases, the gradient update rule aligns with vanilla clipping mechanism of GRPO. This controlled rescaling ensures that the model learns balanced exploratory behavior without completely ignoring high-entropy tokens. To more clearly articulate the theoretical aspects of AEPO compared to clippingoptimized RL methods [3, 85], we discuss their differences in Appendix 2. 3.2.2 Entropy-aware Advantage Estimation. Owing to the clippingbalanced mechanism, we retain the gradients of high-entropy tokens. However, challenge arises in training the model to better distinguish between exploratory and non-exploratory tokens. Traditional outcome-based RL algorithms assign the same advantage to all tokens in sequence based on the answer correctness, neglecting the models confidence levels across different tokens [35, 76]. To this end, we propose an entropy-aware advantage estimation that incorporates token entropy calculation into advantage shaping.

We estimate the entropy advantage for each token based on the average token entropy within the same trajectory. Furthermore, we treat the entropy advantage as regularization term in the advantage estimation to reshape 𝐴acc as: (cid:17) Acc 𝐴 (𝑡 ) Δ𝐻 𝐴 (𝑡 ) = 𝐴(𝑡 ) (cid:16)1 + 𝑎 This step is computed before the policy update. Notably, our entropyaware advantage estimation can be seamlessly integrates with existing agentic RL algorithms to further enhance the models emphasis on learning exploratory tokens during training.

To investigate whether AEPOs dynamic entropybalanced rollout improves sampling diversity, we follow the setup of the preliminary experiment (2.2) and randomly selected samples from 10 rollout steps, encompassing 640 distinct problems and approximately 7.6𝑘 trajectories. We further employ BGEM3 [4] as the semantic embedding model, applied the PCA method for dimensionality reduction, and used DBSCAN [19] for clustering to visualize the representation of rollout sampling. As shown in Figure 6, the results indicate that compared to ARPO, AEPOs sampling trajectories form more distinct cluster centers (54 vs. 62) and exhibit tighter intra-cluster distances with larger inter-cluster gaps. This demonstrates that AEPO improves the scope of rollout diversity and provides clearer differentiation in the sampling path distribution. We attribute this to AEPOs entropy pre-monitoring and continuous entropy Figure 7: The comparison of branch sampling distribution in rollout (left); The comparison of tool-call efficiency across four RL algorithms (right). penalty branches, which effectively address the continuity of high-entropy branches to achieve comprehensive coverage of the problem-solving space. (2) Statistics Analysis. To quantitatively analyze AEPOs effectiveness in addressing rollout collapse, we measure the branch distribution of ARPO and AEPO over 10 steps during rollout. As shown in Figure 7 (left), with both the global and partial branch sampling budgets set to 8, ARPO typically branches into 2-3 trajectories. In contrast, AEPO exhibits more diverse branching pattern, potentially covering all 8 paths with different branches. This highlights AEPOs dynamic resource allocation and continuous branch penalty mechanism enable the model to explore potential high-entropy tool-call steps across different trajectories, effectively mitigating bias in specific path branches. Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization WWW 26, April 1317, 2026, Dubai, UAE Research [21, 47, 72, 83, 90, 106, 109, 121] aims to fully leverage the posttraining paradigm. This includes data synthesis, RL algorithm optimization, and report generation, thereby broadening the scope of web agent training. To minimize resource consumption during training, another line of research seeks to simulate search engines using the generative capabilities of large models for self-alignment [20, 86]. Recently, agentic RL methods [14, 26, 34, 55] have focused on optimizing foundational RL algorithms for web agents, employing tree-structured rollouts for autonomous branch sampling under high entropy. While these methods have advanced web agent training, they often overlook the challenges posed by high-entropy tokens. Several single-turn RL studies [9, 58, 85, 126] have emphasized that stable entropy training is crucial for enhancing model performance. However, this aspect remains largely unexplored in multi-turn agentic RL. In this paper, we introduce AEPO to achieve entropy-balanced web agent RL training."

Building on these foun-\ndations, value-based RL methods have been applied to improve embodied\nintelligence in hardware control and complex gaming tasks [1, 65, 75, 89,\n102, 120].

To confirm the efficiency of AEPOs tool usage, we quantify the tool consumption of AEPO compared to other RL algorithms in the deep information seeking task. As shown in Figure 7 (right), AEPO requires only about half the number of tool calls to achieve superior performance compared to vanilla and clipping-optimized RL algorithms. Additionally, compared to the agentic RL algorithm ARPO, AEPO consistently reduces the number of tool calls. We attribute this enhanced efficiency to the entropy pre-monitoring phase, which balances the allocation of rollout exploration resources based on the information gain from the problem and tool usage. This ensures that AEPO not only broadens the rollout exploration space but also achieves efficient web agent training. (2) Entropy Stability Analysis. To better quantify the effectiveness of entropy-balanced policy optimization during policy updates, we present the RL training curves for 10 reasoning tasks. Figure 8 illustrates the dynamic visualization of entropy loss and validation set accuracy across 10 reasoning tasks throughout the training steps. We observe that using clippingoptimized RL often encounters entropy instability during training, leading to performance collapse. In contrast, AEPO demonstrates more stable entropy curve compared to other reinforcement learning algorithms. Interestingly, sharp fluctuations in entropy loss do not improve training stability and effectiveness. Instead, maintaining consistently high and stable entropy dynamic is generally advantageous for ongoing performance enhancement. This observation supports our initial motivation, as AEPO employs entropybalanced policy optimizations to foster more reasonable and stable entropy dynamics."

            "content": "A Proof of the Gradient of AEPO In this section, we will comprehensively detail the theoretical derivation of AEPOs forward propagation formulas and how they lead to the backward propagation formulas. Specifically: We begin with the loss function: region, propagating fixed penalty regardless of sample reliability. AEPO, instead, sets 𝐹𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 0, effectively filtering out low-confidence negative advantages. This simple but principled change prevents unstable gradient signals from low-likelihood rollouts and reduces the variance introduced by symmetric updates. Consequently, AEPO achieves smoother optimization dynamics and more stable convergence, especially under high-entropy exploration regimes where CISPO often exhibits oscillatory behavior. Figure 8 provides experimental evidence for this discussion. 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 min = E𝑥 (cid:18) 𝛿, 1 𝜖𝑙 , (cid:18) 𝛿 𝐴 (𝑡 ) , clip 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 (cid:19) (12) (𝜃 ) represents the importance ratio, and sg() is the stopgradient operator. Given that 𝐴(𝑡 ) is constant and 𝜃 𝛿 = 𝛿 𝜙𝜃 (𝑎 𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 ), the gradient of 𝑓 (𝛿 ) can be expressed as: where 𝛿 = 𝑟 ( 𝑗 ) 1 + 𝜖ℎ sg(𝛿 ) 𝐴(𝑡 ) 𝑡 =1 𝑗 =1 𝛿 (cid:19) , 𝑡 B.2 GPPO where 𝜃 𝑓 (𝛿 ) = 𝐴 (𝑡 ) 𝑠 (𝛿 ) 𝛿 𝜙𝜃 (𝑎 𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 ), (13) where 𝑠 (𝛿 ) depends on the range of 𝛿. Therefore, we consider three ℓ (𝑡 ) = scenarios: (1) If 𝐴 (𝑡 ) > 0 and 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ: The upper clipping boundary is active, so 𝑓 /𝛿 = (1 + 𝜖ℎ )/sg(𝛿 ), effectively simplifying to (1 + 𝜖ℎ ). (2) If 𝐴(𝑡 ) < 0 and 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ : The lower clipping boundary dominates, leading to 𝑓 /𝛿 = 0, causing the gradient to vanish. The region is unclipped, resulting in 𝑓 /𝛿 = 𝛿. By combining all cases, we derive: F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 0, 𝛿, 𝐴 (𝑡 ) > 0, 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0, 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ , otherwise. Thus, the gradient update is given by: 𝜃 = E𝑥 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 𝑗 = 𝑡 =1 F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) 𝜙𝜃 (𝑎 𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 ) 𝐴 (𝑡 ) (14) . (15)"

B.1 CISPO = E𝑥 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 𝛿 𝐴(𝑡 ) log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎 ( 𝑗 ) 𝑡 𝑠 ( 𝑗 ) 𝑡 ) 𝑗 =1 By expanding the gradient of the loss function, we obtain: 𝑡 =1 𝜃 = E𝑥 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 𝑗 =1 𝑡 =1 F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) 𝜙𝜃 (𝑎 𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 ) 𝐴 (𝑡 ) where F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 1 𝜖ℓ , 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 1 𝜖ℓ , 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0, 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ , 𝐴 (𝑡 ) > 0, 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 𝐴 (𝑡 ) > 0, 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ , 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0, 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 𝛿, otherwise. (16) . , (17) (18) As shown in Eq. (14), AEPO modifies the CISPO objective by introducing an asymmetric clipping rule that deactivates gradient flow when both 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0 and 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ . In CISPO, the gradient factor remains 𝐹𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 1 𝜖ℓ for this LGPPO (𝜃 ) = E𝑥 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 𝑗 =1 𝑡 =1 ℓ (𝑡 ) , (19) 𝛽1 𝛽2 1 𝜖ℓ sg(𝛿 ) 1 + 𝜖ℎ sg(𝛿 ) 𝛿 𝐴 (𝑡 ) , 𝛿 𝐴 (𝑡 ) , 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0, 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ , 𝛿 𝐴 (𝑡 ) , 𝐴(𝑡 ) > 0, 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ, (20) otherwise. By expanding its gradient, we have: 𝜃 LGPPO = E𝑥 where 1 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑗 =1 𝑇𝑗 𝐺 𝑇𝑗 𝑗 =1 𝑡 = F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) 𝜙𝜃 (𝑎 𝑗,𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 ) 𝐴 (𝑡 ) F𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 𝛽1 (1 𝜖ℓ ), 𝛽2 (1 + 𝜖ℎ ), 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0, 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ , 𝐴 (𝑡 ) > 0, 𝛿 > 1 + 𝜖ℎ, 𝛿, otherwise. , (21) (22) Compared with GPPO, which retains bounded (non-zero) gradients inside clipped regions via its 𝛽-scaled correction terms, AEPO enforces stricter rule: residual gradients in the region 𝐴 (𝑡 ) < 0, 𝛿 < 1 𝜖ℓ are discarded (i.e., 𝐹𝑡 (𝜃 ) = 0). Empirically, we find that agentic RL training is particularly sensitive to GPPO-style pessimistic suppression. Since our goal is to exploit high-entropy tokens with positive rewards, excessive pessimism can hamper effective credit assignment for these tokens. AEPO therefore removes residual negative updates while allowing high-entropy, positively rewarded tokens to fully contribute to the gradient, improving both stability and credit propagation in long-horizon agentic tasks. Baselines In this section, we provide detailed overview of the baseline models involved in all experiments, as follows: C.1 RL algorithms (1) Classical RL Method: GRPO [76] is reinforcement learning algorithm for fine-tuning large language models via group-based policy optimization. It optimizes model behaviors by comparing responses within sampled groups and assigning relative rewards, enabling more stable and sample-efficient policy updates. Reinforce++ [35] extends the classic policy-gradient algorithm by incorporating variance reduction and adaptive normalization techniques. It improves training stability and sample efficiency when fine-tuning language models with scalar rewards, while keeping the overall objective aligned with standard REINFORCE. (2) Clipping-optimized RL Method DAPO [118] decouples the clipping operation from the policy update to achieve more stable optimization, and introduces dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively selects training examples to maintain effective Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization Hangyu Mao2, Fuzheng Zhang2, Kun Gai2, Guorui Zhou266, Yutao Zhu1, Ji-Rong Wen1, Zhicheng Dou166 WWW 26, April 1317, 2026, Dubai, UAE Algorithm 2 Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization Require: Reasoning model 𝜋𝜃 , external tools 𝑇 , total rollout size 𝑘, entropy sensitivity 𝛽, branch penalty slope 𝛾, clipping bounds 𝜖𝑙, 𝜖ℎ, entropy-aware weight 𝛼 1: Input: Dataset 𝐷 2: Initialize reference model: 𝜋 old 3: for 𝑖 = 1 to do 4: Sample mini-batch 𝐷𝑏 𝐷 𝜃 𝜋𝜃 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: 29: 30: 31: 32: 33: 34: 35: 36: 37: 38: 39: 40: 41: 42: 43: 44: // Dynamic Entropy-Balanced Rollout for each query 𝑞 𝐷𝑏 do Generate 1 complete trajectory 𝑟 to obtain 𝐻root and 𝐻 avg tool Global rollout size 𝑚 𝑘 𝜎(cid:0)𝛽 (𝐻root 𝐻 avg Branch rollout size 𝑏 𝑘 𝑚 Initialize rollout pool Consecutive-high-entropy counter 𝑙 0 while < 𝑚 do tool)(cid:1) Sample trajectory 𝑟 ; add to end while while 𝑏 > 0 and 𝑟 𝑗 not terminated do Select trajectory 𝑟 at tool-call step 𝑡 Δ𝐻𝑡 Normalize(𝐻𝑡 𝐻initial) Consecutive penalty ˆ𝑃 (𝑙) 𝛾 𝑙 Branch probability 𝑃𝑡 (𝛼 + 𝛽Δ𝐻𝑡 )(1 ˆ𝑃 (𝑙)) if 𝑃𝑡 > 𝜏 then Branch 𝑍 sub-trajectories; 𝑏 𝑏 𝑍 else 𝑙 𝑙 + 1 if Δ𝐻𝑡 > 0 end if end while if 𝑏 > 0 then Sample 𝑏 additional trajectories and add to end if end for // Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization for step = 1 to do Compute standard advantage ˆ𝐴Acc and entropy advantage ˆ𝐴Δ𝐻 via Eq.

These techniques together improve training efficiency and prevent performance degradation in long-horizon reasoning tasks. GPPO [84] extends the PPO framework by decoupling the clipping operation between the forward and backward passes. During optimization, the policy ratio is clipped in the forward computation to ensure bounded updates, while the original, unclipped ratio is used in the backward path to preserve complete gradient information. CISPO [61] reformulates ratio clipping by applying the constraint to importance sampling weights instead of policy ratios. It bounds update magnitudes in expectation while preserving token-level gradient information through unclipped policy ratios. (3) Agentic RL Method GIGPO [26] groups complete trajectories at episode level to compute macro-relative advantages, and also retroactively groups actions sharing anchor states across trajectories at step level to compute micro-relative advantages. Both levels are combined without using critic, preserving the critic-free nature while enabling per-step credit signals. ARPO [14] is an RL method tailored for multi-turn LLM agents. It introduces an entropy-based adaptive rollout scheme that increases sampling in steps with high uncertainty, and incorporates an advantage attribution mechanism to assign credit across branching tool-use interactions. C.2 Web Search Agent RAG [44] (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines information retrieval with generative modeling to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of outputs. It retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating responses, addressing internal knowledge gaps and reducing hallucinations. Search-o1 [50] is framework designed to enhance reasoning by integrating agentic RAG mechanisms with Reason-in-Documents module. It improves accuracy, coherence, and reliability in reasoning tasks, outperforming native reasoning and traditional RAG methods in complex scenarios. WebThinker [51] is an open-source framework developed by Renmin University of China, enabling LRMs to autonomously search, explore web pages, and generate research reports. It employs direct preference optimization and iterative synthesis tools to enhance tool utilization capabilities. ReAct [115] combines reasoning and action to tackle complex tasks effectively. It allows models to generate reasoning steps and use external tools, such as search engines and databases, during decision-making, optimizing results through iterative processes. The Overall Algorithm Workflow of AEPO In this section, we delve into the overall workflow of the Agentic EntropyBalanced Policy Optimization (AEPO) algorithm, as depicted in Algorithm Diagram 2. The AEPO algorithm integrates dynamic entropy-balanced rollouts with entropy-balanced policy optimization to enhance multi-turn tool-use capabilities in large language models."
