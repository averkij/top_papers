U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking 1. Introduction Medical image segmentation is critical and challenging task that can greatly enhance diagnostic efficiency by offering doctors objective and precise references for regions of interest (Zhou et al., 2017). Over the past decade, U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015) has become cornerstone of medical image segmentation, thanks to its encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that effectively combine multi-scale features. Building on its promising segmentation results across diverse modalities, numerous U-shaped variants have been proposed to further improve performance, with lightweight designs (Valanarasu and Patel, 2022, Tang et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2024a, Valanarasu et al., 2021, Cao et al., 2022), attention mechanisms (Oktay et al., 2018, Tang et al., 2023), multi-scale feature fusion (Zhou et al., 2018, Huang et al., 2020), and more recently Mamba- (Liu et al., 2024a, Wu et al., 2025b), RWKV-based (Ye et al., 2025, Jiang et al., 2025), as well as hybrid architectures (Chen et al., 2021, Tang et al., 2025b, Dong et al., 2025, Tang et al., 2025a). Over the past decade, more than ten thousand U-Net variants have been proposed, and by 2025, nearly thousand studies have employed U-shaped networks for medical image segmentation. Among the vast number of U-Net variants, central challenge remains unresolved: How to conduct fair and comprehensive comparison across them? Although several benchmarks and surveys have attempted to organize this proliferation (Tab. 1), they mostly lack large-scale, systematic evaluation. Critical aspects such as robustness of improvements, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency are often overlooked, and they also fail to provide complete and in-depth analyses of dataset-specific characteristics and model architectures. Despite reported gains in recent works, many studies report metrics without statistical validation (73% omit it, Fig. 1D), use incomplete baseline comparisons, or rely on limited dataset coverage. Moreover, efficiency, although vital for real-world clinical deployment (Vashist, 2017, Wenderott et al., 2024, Xu et al., 2025), is rarely considered. Compounding this issue, evaluations are typically confined to in-distribution settings (84% of work ignores zero-shot evaluation, Fig. 1D), even though clinical practice inevitably involves domain shifts across institutions and annotation protocols (Yan et al., 2019, Koch et al., 2024). These gaps leave the robustness and practicality of U-Net variants in real-world scenarios largely unverified (Niu et al., 2024). To systematically and comprehensively evaluate U-shaped medical image segmentation models, we introduce U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous, and efficiency-oriented benchmark for U-Net and its variants. U-Bench is built upon three key aspects: (1) Broad dataset and model coverage: we implement 100 recent U-Net variants and evaluate them on 28 benchmark datasets covering 10 diverse imaging modalities (ultrasound, dermoscopy, endoscopy, fundus photography, histopathology, nuclear imaging, X-ray, MRI, CT, and OCT; Fig. 1A, C). (2) Rigorous and comprehensive evaluation: all models are implemented to calculate performance gains over the baseline U-Net with statistical significance, ensuring robust and fair comparisons (Fig. 1E). To capture clinical utility, we further assess zero-shot generalization across modalities. Additionally, to address practical considerations in real-world edge deployment, we introduce the U-Score, statistically grounded, large-scale metric that jointly accounts for accuracy, parameter numbers, computational cost, and inference speed (Fig. 1F). (3) Public availability and reproducibility: U-Bench implements models using official code implementations, pre-trained weights, and deep supervision strategies (if available). At the same time, U-Bench is released with all code, models, and protocols, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. Building on this large-scale evaluation, we identify key findings that challenge common assumptions. Traditional metrics like IoU show signs of saturation, offering limited discriminative power (Fig. 1F). Additionally, reported improvements are often inconsistent or statistically insignificant (Fig. 1E). At the same time, an increasing focus on storage and computational cost is reflected in the rising trajectory of U-Score 3 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking Table 1: Comparisons between U-Bench and other medical image segmentation benchmarks.

To explore these dynamics, we conduct systematic analysis of U-Net variants, examining the influence of dataset and architectural factors on model performance across different modalities, architectures, and computational resource limitations (Fig. 1G). Building on these analyses, we introduce model advisor agent that suggests suitable architectures based on dataset and task attributes, turning an actionable guidance for practitioners in clinical and research contexts. Our contribution can be summarized as: We provide comprehensive evaluation benchmark of 100 U-shaped variants across 28 datasets from 10 modalities with rigorous assessment across statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. To better capture the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we introduce U-Score, novel metric grounded in large-scale statistical analysis that enables fair and holistic evaluation. We summarize the observations over large-scale evaluation: Most variants show performance gains, but few show in-domain statistical significance over the original U-Net. Zero-shot performances show significant and promising improvements. U-Score shows an increasing trajectory, indicating the shift from purely pursuing accuracy to balancing accuracy with efficiency. We disentangle different aspects, including dataset characteristics and architectural designs, revealing their impact on performance and efficiency, and further build model recommender that helps researchers identify well-suited architectures under diverse data and resource conditions. We open-source U-Bench and all the pretrained weights, providing large-scale benchmark with comprehensive evaluation for medical image segmentation, to foster fair, robust, generalizable, and efficient research in the community. 4 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking 2. U-Bench Construction 2.1. Preliminaries: u-shaped design 𝑁 2(𝑖1) 𝑖=1 , 𝑓𝑖 R𝐶𝑖 𝐻 U-shaped model generally comprises three components: hierarchical encoder, decoder, bottleneck, and skip-connection. Given an input image 𝑥 R3𝐻𝑊 , Encoder() extracts multiscale features 𝑓𝑖 by 𝑁 stages from up-bottom, denoted as 𝑊 2(𝑖1) . Bottleneck() processes the last {𝑓𝑖} output feature, and Decoder() is composed of 𝑁 1 stages for upsampling decoder features 𝑑𝑗 from bottom-up, each stage comprises Skip-connection() for feature fusion. Final prediction 𝑥 is produced by the segmentation head after the top decoder stage. The differences across variants are illustrated in Fig. 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and related architectures (Attention, Mamba, RWKV) form the core building blocks, which can be organized in pure CNN / Attention, parallel, or sequential configurations for both encoding and decoding. Detailed categorization can be found in the Appendix and D. Figure 2: Summary of U-shaped networks. The network comprises an encoder, bottleneck, and decoder with skip-connection, each of which can integrate attention gates and multiscale fusion. 2.2. Dataset and Model Zoo Dataset Zoo. As shown in Fig. 1(C), the U-Bench dataset zoo consists of 28 diverse 2D medical image segmentation datasets spanning wide range of imaging modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, endoscopy, fundus photography, histopathology, nuclear imaging, X-ray, MRI, CT, and OCT. We train on 20 datasets and evaluate zero-shot generalization on 8 additional ones. Following prior work (Chen et al., 2021, Tang et al., 2025b, Valanarasu and Patel, 2022, Jiang et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2022a), all datasets are resized to 256256 and augmented by random rotation and flipping; for models with fixed input size, we keep their original resolution (typically 224224). Official splits are used when available; otherwise, 7/3 split is applied. All details on datasets and preprocessing are provided in the Appendix C. Model Zoo. We curate collection of 100 publicly available and widely adopted U-Net variants, covering CNN-, Transformer-, Mamba-, and RWKV-based architectures, as well as their hybrid designs (Fig. 1(B)). To ensure strict reproducibility and fair comparison, we follow the official implementations for all models, adopting their predefined settings, pretrained weights, and deep supervision strategies when available. All model details are provided in the Appendix D. 2.3. Evaluation Protocol Evaluation Metrics. Following previous works (Luo et al., 2025, Jiang et al., 2025, Tang et al., 2025b, Valanarasu and Patel, 2022, Tang et al., 2024), we evaluate segmentation performance using Intersection over Union (IoU). To evaluate the statistical significance of performance differences between models, we conduct paired sample 𝑡-tests, comparing each variant to the baseline U-Net. U-Bench also considers computational efficiency metrics, including Parameters (M), FLOPs (G), and FPS. All result details are provided in the Appendix D. Zero-shot Evaluation. To evaluate the generalization capability of each model beyond the training distribu5 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking Figure 3: Comparison between IoU and U-Score. Red rectangle indicates the models perform better than U-Net in IoU, and green rectangle indicates the models perform better than U-Net in U-Score. (A) Across 100 variants, few methods show better IoU compared to baseline U-Net, while more than half of the methods show better U-Score. (B) The relationship between performance (IoU) and the increase in computational resources (FLOPs, parameters, FPS) is complex, whereas U-Score offers clear distribution that effectively distinguishes favorable and unfavorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off. tion, we conduct zero-shot inference on unseen datasets within the same modality and task. Specifically, models are trained on source datasets and then directly evaluated on unseen datasets that share the same modality but differ in acquisition domain. Detailed dataset split can be found in Fig. 1(C). This approach aligns with clinical demands, where domain shifts frequently occur in real-world applications due to variations in devices, institutions, and patient populations. U-Score. To assess real-world deployability, we propose U-Score, unified metric that jointly accounts for accuracy and efficiency. For each model 𝑖, we compute segmentation accuracy evaluated by IoU 𝐴𝑖 parameter 𝑃𝑖, FLOPs 𝐺𝑖, and FPS 𝑆𝑖, which are percentile-normalized into 𝑎𝑖, 𝑝𝑖, 𝑔𝑖, 𝑠𝑖 [0, 1] using the 10-th/90-th quantiles across the model zoo. Given harmonic mean function ℋ() with equal weights for each input, an efficiency subscore Eff𝑖 = ℋ(𝑝𝑖, 𝑔𝑖, 𝑠𝑖) is obtained, ensuring that no single factor dominates. The final UScore is defined as U-Score𝑖 = ℋ(𝑎𝑖, Eff𝑖) to incorporate segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency equally. This combination rewards models that achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and provides deployment-oriented alternative to IoU. More details can be found in Appendix E. We report the IoU and U-Score for all models with parameter count, FLOPs, and FPS, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig 1(F). Models with lower computational costs show wide variation in IoU performance, while heavier models tend to achieve higher accuracy at the expense of greater resource consumption. The U-Net baseline, which falls in the middle in terms of computational demand, delivers reasonably strong performance. Although some models surpass U-Net in segmentation accuracy, they require substantially different levels of computational overhead, making direct comparisons with the baseline difficult. Using U-Score, however, reveals that U-Net has weak accuracy-efficiency trade-off, whereas other models show more distinct and discriminative results, allowing clearer separation between approaches with favorable and unfavorable trade-offs. Notably, the IoU gains of advanced models over U-Net are marginal, suggesting saturation point, while the large gap between the Top-1 modelâĂŹs U-Score and U-NetâĂŹs highlights that IoU alone is no longer the key bottleneck in medical segmentation tasks. These findings underscore that efficiency is becoming an increasingly critical factor in model development and practical deployment. 6 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking 3. U-Bench Results & Discussion In this section, we present the results of the U-Bench benchmark across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. We organize the results as follows: In 3.1, we present and discuss retrospective analysis of the develop trends and statistical findings over 100 variants spanning different architectures and publication years. In 3.2, we disentangle influence factors into two aspects: dataset and architecture, and analyze how these factors impact model performance. In 3.3, we propose our ranking-based advisor agent, offering practical guidance for selecting optimal models based on dataset characteristics and resource constraints. 3.1. Retrospective Analysis of the Past Decade Finding 1: In-domain Top-1 performance has marginal gains in segmentation accuracy, while zero-shot improves more pronouncedly. We analyzed 100 variants across different architectures and publication years (the detailed list can be found in the Appendix of Fig. 9), reporting the best-performing variant for each year, as shown in Fig. 4. Over the past decade, 70% of modalities have demonstrated steady progress of segmentation accuracy in both source and target domains, as reflected in IoU. However, IoU gains have been marginal (on average 1%-2%) and inconsistent. Some modalities (i.e. OCT, Nuclei, and Fundus) even show sign of stagnation. In comparison, when considering zero-shot performances, the improvements have been more obvious (more than 3% on average) in 80% of the modalities. Finding 2: Although some in-domain improvements exist on average, few reach statistical significance, whereas the average zero-shot improvements remain consistently significant. To rigorously distinguish modalities with genuine improvements from those with only numerical fluctuations, we perform 𝑡-tests between each variant and the U-Net baseline. The results are presented in Fig. 1(E) and Fig. 5. We observe that over 80% of variants fail to achieve statistically significant improvements. Even in the most heavily studied modalities, such as Ultrasound, Endoscopy, Dermoscopy, CT, and MRI, most gains are marginal and lack significance. Only handful of datasets (e.g., BUSI, TNSCUI, Kvasir, ISIC2018, Convidquex) exhibit consistent clusters of superior variants. In contrast, in experiments with zero-shot transfer, for variants that outperform U-Net, more than 50% of the variants are significant across 75% of the modalities. Possible explanations for findings 1 & 2: We provide possible explanation for these interesting observations. Considering in-domain evaluations, the improvements with statistical significance is typically associated with the lesion localization tasks which requires global semantic comparison. Specifically, lesions often exhibit significant differences from surrounding normal tissues, requiring global context to model these distinctions Zhou et al. (2017), Isensee et al. (2021). In recent years, with the growing adoption of long-range modeling techniques (e.g., attention-based Transformers, state-space models such as Mamba, and RNN-inspired hybrids like RWKV), architectural innovations have increasingly focused on capturing long-range dependencies, leading to more pronounced and steady improvements in these lesion segmentation tasks. On the other hand, long-range modeling techniques have been proven to be more generalizable (Jiang et al., 2024a, Harun et al., 2024, Hou et al., 2025, Gu et al., 2024), leading to improvements in zeroshot generalization ability. By contrast, modalities dominated by repetitive local patterns (e.g., Nuclei, Fundus) benefit far less from global modeling, exhibiting only marginal improvements. This underscores the complementary need for localized mechanisms to achieve precise boundary delineation. Finding 3: Increasing attention on efficiency. While IoU shows marginal improvements, U-Score improvements are more pronounced, with an average increase of 33%. This trend supports our argument in Sec. 2.3, where we suggest that IoU has reached saturation point and has limited ability to discriminate favorable 7 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking Figure 4: Performance trends of SOTA models over the past decade. The x-axis indicates publication year, with each point marking the yearly best result. The y-axes report two evaluation metrics: IoU (left axis) and U-Score (right axis). The trends summary is shown as arrows at the top of the y-axis, with green ones highlighting improvements and red ones indicating stagnation. Source domain performance is show at the top, and zero-shot performance is shown at the bottom. Figure 5: Statistical significance analysis against U-Net across 28 datasets across 10 modalities. The outer blue pie represents the number of variants surpassing U-Net; the inner pie quantifies the statistical significance of the methods with improvements, annotated by non-significant to highly significant, with the number of works annotated in the middle. In general, in-domain improvements show limited statistical significance, while zero-shot performances show more significant improvements. methods from unfavorable ones, indicating that accuracy alone is no longer the bottleneck of segmentation. The increasing trend of U-Score reflects the growing emphasis and room for improvement on efficient models in the medical community, echoing the practical demand for clinical deployment beyond the lab research. 8 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking Table 2: Top-10 variants ranked by performance (IoU) and efficiency (U-Score) under in-domain and zero-shot settings.

Left: IoU-based comparison; Right: U-Score-based comparison of different architecture strengths in sourcedomain and zero-shot. 3.2. Influencing Factor Analysis: Architectures and Data Characteristics 3.2.1. Architectures To analyze the performance regarding architectural choices, we divide 100 models into five families: CNN, Transformer, Mamba, RWKV, and Hybrid. The detailed descriptions are summarized in Appendix D. We present the top-10 variants across all datasets ranked by IoU and U-Score under in-domain and zero-shot settings, as shown in Tab. 2, and we calculate the average performance of each architecture family, as shown in Fig. 6. Considering segmentation performance (IoU), Hybrid architectures achieve the highest accuracy by combining local priors with global attention. As shown in Tab. 2(Left), 5 of the top 10 models in both in-domain and zero-shot are hybrid, highlighting their high potential. On average, the hybrid family consistently delivers the best in-domain performance and competitive zero-shot generalization (Fig. 6(Left)), particularly excelling on lesion-centric tasks such as Ultrasound and Endoscopy. The newly proposed RWKV family ranks first in IoU for both in-domain and zero-shot evaluations, indicating promising potential despite limited prior research. In contrast, Mamba family shows weaker segmentation performance, which may be attributed to its architectural design, which, despite its strengths in certain tasks, might struggle with capturing fine-grained details or handling complex patterns in segmentation tasks. Once computational demands are taken into account, as shown in Tab. 2(Right), the U-Score-based leaderboard is reshuffled, with the CNN family leading in performance, comprising 7 / 5 out of the top 10 models in in-domain / zero-shot settings, respectively. The newly proposed RWKV family achieves the best average in-domain results and competitive zero-shot performance (Fig. 6(Right)), further supporting its structural 9 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking Figure 7: Performance analysis under varying foreground properties. (A) Foreground properties influence segmentation task difficulty. The yellow background indicates the challenge segmentation case. (B) Architectural influence on segmentation difficulty across diverse foreground properties. Dark / Shallow: hard / easy case. superiority and potential. In contrast, inefficient long-range modeling methods, including Transformer, and Hybrid architectures, face higher computational demands, leading to reduced performance when evaluated by U-Score. Although Mamba excels in efficiency, its inconsistent accuracy undermines the U-Score, offsetting its efficiency advantage. 3.2.2. Data Characteristics We further investigate how performances vary with distinct foreground characteristics with three aspects: foreground scale, boundary sharpness, and shape complexity. The Appendix F.1 provides detailed definitions for the different scales of target area, edge, and shape regularity. Figure 7(A) summarizes the characteristics of challenging cases: blurry boundaries are the dominant factor, with often causing substantial drops in segmentation performance, while small object size and irregular shapes further exacerbate the difficulty. When these foreground properties shift across datasets, different models exhibit varying performance patterns. As shown in Fig. 7(B), consistent with our earlier findings, hybrid architectures dominate both in easier and more challenging cases, proving that local and global fusion mechanism enables greater adaptability across diverse foreground properties, particularly for blurry boundaries. RWKV-based models show specific strength in capturing irregular but well-defined shapes, reflecting their ability to model long-range contours. Nonetheless, boundary ambiguity, along with small and irregular targets, remains the central challenge; given its prevalence in medical images, uncertainty-aware designs are needed. Since architectural strengths are dataset-dependent, these observations highlight the importance of task-aware advising mechanisms that can match models to dataset properties. 3.3. Model Advisor Agent Based on our analysis, we introduce ranking-based model advisor agent, designed to guide the community in selecting the most suitable models based on dataset characteristics and task requirements. This tool not only streamlines model selection but also helps users navigate the trade-offs between performance and efficiency, ensuring more informed, task-aware decisions. Figure 8: Our model advisor agent. The system overview is shown in Fig. 8. Our advisor agent system utilizes dataset-level characteristics (e.g., 10 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking modality, boundary sharpness, shape complexity, and foreground scale) along with resource constraints (storage, computation, and speed) to predict the suitability of various U-shaped architectures. Rather than relying on manual trial-and-error approach, our framework leverages XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) as the recommended backbone and outputs candidate models and architectures that best satisfy the specified requirements. Crucially, the output is not single best model but prioritized list, offering more flexibility in choices to practitioners. Further details on the recommendation setup, dataset construction, implementation details, and evaluation metrics are provided in the Appendix F.2 and F.3. Table 3: NDCG, MAP, and Spearman correlation of our advisor agent. We design set of experiments to validate the feasibility of automatic model suggestion in medical image segmentation. Our setup uses 18 in-domain datasets for training and holds out 2 datasets for validation. We use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), mean average precision (MAP) and Spearman correlation for evaluation (See Appendix F.3). As shown in Tab. 3, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model advisor agent effectively recovers ranking orders that align with ground-truth IoU and U-Score rank in our benchmark. The results validate that our advisor agent system is able to prioritize suitable models across different task requirements, making it reliable tool for model selection and deployment.

Conclusion key challenge in the field of medical image segmentation remains: How can we conduct fair and comprehensive comparison across the numerous U-shaped variants ? To address this, we introduce U-Bench, framework that fills critical gaps in prior evaluations by offering comprehensive, statistically rigorous, and efficiency-oriented approach. Our results challenge common assumptions in the field, revealing that while many variants show performance gains, few achieve statistical significance in-domain. In contrast, zero-shot generalization demonstrates substantial improvements, highlighting the potential for better model generalization across domains. In addition, the newly proposed U-Score metric, which emphasizes efficiency alongside performance, signals paradigm shift from models focused solely on accuracy to those that balance both performance and efficiency. Leveraging insights from our analysis of model architecture and dataset characteristics, we propose ranking-based model agent that transforms our large-scale evaluation into actionable guidance for selecting models tailored to specific tasks. By releasing U-Bench as an open-source platform, we provide the community with robust, reproducible tool to advance research in segmentation, enabling the development of models that are both accurate and feasible for clinical deployment. 5.

Related Work In Appendix B, we present broad view of the variations of U-shape networks, including the architecture of the network and existing medical segmentation benchmarks. B.1. Model Architecture As the core architecture for medical image segmentation, the U-Net has evolved into numerous variants in recent years, driven by advancements in feature representation capabilities, long-range dependency modeling techniques, and the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. This section categorizes and organizes these U-Net variants based on their core paradigms and design motivations, systematically tracing their evolutionary path from foundational construction to integrated innovation. Fig. 9 summarizes the evolution of U-Net variants over time. Figure 9: Time and architecture distribution of all evaluated models. 1. U-shaped Networks Dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (2015-2021: Foundational Laying) U-shaped networks, using convolutional neural networks as their sole backbone, extract local features through convolution operations and utilize fixed skip connections to fuse multi-scale information, laying the foundation for the \"encoder-decoder\" paradigm in medical image segmentation. Their advantages lie in their ability to accurately capture local details (such as textures and edges), their relatively lightweight architecture, and their stable training process, providing solid design baseline for subsequent complex variants. However, the local receptive field of convolutional operations limits the ability to model global semantic information, and fixed skip connections easily lead to semantic gap between the encoder and decoder, limiting performance. 2. Transformer-driven U-Networks (2021-2023: Paradigm Shift) This variant introduces the Transformer architecture (including variants such as Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021)) to replace or enhance the traditional CNN 13 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking backbone, leveraging the self-attention mechanism to effectively model long-range dependencies. However, the computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism grows quadratically with sequence length, resulting in low inference efficiency. Furthermore, this type of model is poorly adaptable to small-scale medical datasets and is prone to overfitting due to insufficient data, making it difficult to meet the stringent real-time requirements of clinical edge devices. 3. U-Networks Based on State-Space Models (SSMs) and Recurrent Paradigms (2023-2025: EfficiencyOriented) Recent research explores replacing the quadratic-cost self-attention with linear-time alternatives. One line leverages state-space models (e.g., Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023)) that adopt selective state updates to capture long-range dependencies while achieving linear complexity, markedly improving inference efficiency and adaptability to small sample sizes. Another complementary line introduces RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), recurrent-inspired model that combines Transformer-like expressiveness with RNN-style recurrence, enabling efficient sequential processing and stronger generalization across varying input lengths. Together, these paradigms alleviate the computational and data-dependency limitations of Transformers. 4. Multi-Paradigm Fusion U-Networks (Hybrid Networks) (2020-2025: Fusion and Innovation) This phase aims to integrate the advantages of CNNs in local feature extraction, the global semantic modeling capabilities of Transformers. The goal is to achieve balance between accuracy, efficiency, and generalization by fusing different architectures. This type of network variant can adapt to complex clinical scenarios such as multimodal imaging and cross-center data heterogeneity, significantly improving the practical value of segmentation results. However, the architectural design complexity increases significantly, and the coordination mechanisms between modules of different paradigms (such as the timing of feature interactions and weight distribution) still need further optimization. The development of the four types of U-shaped network variants follows technological evolutionary path of \"local refinement global correlation efficiency considerations multi-paradigm collaboration,\" reflecting the shift in clinical needs from static, single-scenario segmentation toward more efficient, generalized solutions adaptable across diverse conditions. B.2. Medical Segmentation Benchmarks To fill the research gap in the evaluation of U-net systems, we comprehensively compare previous segmentation evaluation benchmarks with the U-Bench proposed in this paper, thereby clarifying the innovative positioning of U-Bench. B.2.1. Related Work Medical image segmentation has seen rapid progress, driven by deep learning architectures and large-scale datasets. However, the validity and reproducibility of many reported advances have been challenged due to inconsistent evaluation protocols, limited dataset diversity, and insufficient consideration of deployment constraints. TorchStone (Bassi et al., 2024) addressed some of these limitations by introducing large-scale collaborative benchmark for abdominal organ segmentation, leveraging diverse CT scans from multiple hospitals worldwide. While it emphasized out-of-distribution generalization and standardized evaluation, its scope was limited to single anatomical region and modality, making it less suitable for assessing broader architectural capabilities. MedSegBench (Zhou et al., 2025) expanded coverage across modalities, incorporating 35 datasets from 14 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking ultrasound, MRI, X-ray, and others. It provided standardized splits and evaluated multiple encoder-decoder variants, aiming to foster universal segmentation models. However, its focus remained on smaller set of architectures and lacked comprehensive analysis of robustness, efficiency, and cross-paradigm comparisons. nnWNet (Zhou et al., 2025) proposed architectural modifications to integrate convolutions and transformers within U-Net framework, addressing the need for continuous transmission of local and global features. Although it benchmarked on multiple 2D and 3D datasets, its evaluation was limited to small number of models and lacked systematic efficiency analysis. nnU-Net Revisited (Isensee et al., 2024) critically examined recent architectural claims, showing that properly configured CNN-based U-Nets could still match or outperform newer transformer and Mamba-based models when trained with sufficient resources. This study highlighted the importance of rigorous baselines and computational reproducibility, yet it did not provide multi-modal, multi-dataset framework for comparing large number of variants. Collectively, these efforts underscore the need for unified, statistically rigorous, and comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates broad spectrum of U-Net variants across diverse modalities, datasets, and deployment metrics. B.2.2. Targeted Improvements of U-Bench As summarized in Tab. 1, existing medical image segmentation benchmarks suffer from limited modality coverage, insufficient evaluation diversity, narrow architectural scope, and lack of dataset-specific analysisâĂŤall of which hinder comprehensive assessment of model generalization. To address these gaps, U-Bench is designed with three targeted innovations, establishing more comprehensive and clinically relevant evaluation framework while aligning with its core goals: evaluating 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 modalities, introducing the performance-efficiency balanced U-Score, and enabling fair, reproducible benchmarking. 1. Multimodality and Full Task Coverage U-Bench encompasses 10 major medical imaging modalities (ultrasound, dermoscopy, endoscopy, fundus, histopathology, nuclei, X-Ray, MRI, CT, OCT) and integrates 28 datasets (sample sizes: 20-17,000). It covers tasks from macroscopic organ segmentation (e.g., lung CT, cardiac MRI) to microscopic structure segmentation (e.g., histopathological nuclei, retinal microvasculature), with standardized train/test splits. This design tests cross-modality adaptability of models, matching real-world clinical multimodal diagnostic workflows. 2. Multi-Dimensional Evaluation System Beyond traditional accuracy metrics (IoU, Dice), U-Bench introduces three critical evaluation dimensions and unified U-Score to quantify clinical utility: Computational Efficiency: Standardized reporting of model parameters (M), inference FLOPs (G), and FPS to reflect deployability on resource-constrained devices. Generalization Performance: Zero-shot transfer tests on 8 unseen target datasets (distinct from 20 training source datasets) to assess robustness to domain shifts (e.g., cross-center ultrasound, unseen dermoscopic lesions). Statistical Significance: Paired t-tests between each variant and the original U-Net (p < 0.05 as significant) to validate reliable performance gains. U-Score: comprehensive metric using quantile normalization and weighted harmonic mean to balance accuracy and efficiency, bridging academic performance and clinical deployment value. 3. Large-Scale Reproducible Validation U-Bench includes 100 publicly available U-Net variants, covering mainstream architectures from 2015 to 2025 (CNN, Transformer, Mamba, RWKV, hybrid designs). To ensure reproducibility, all models adopt official implementations, pre-trained weights (if available), and deep supervision strategies (if applicable). 15 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking C.

Details of Model Zoo We conducted comprehensive statistical analysis of the 100 models evaluated by U-Stone, as shown in Tab. 5, 6 and 7. Tab. 5 and Tab. 6 summarize the basic information of the single architecture and hybrid architecture respectively, quantifying critical metrics including deep supervision adoption, pre-training status, zero-shot capability, statistical significance (P-value), parameter count (Params), computational cost 18 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking (FLOPs), and inference speed (FPS); Tab. 7 further clarifies the training foundation of all evaluated models, documenting their publication year, venue, target dataset modality, and open-source repository links for reproducibility. E. Details of U-Score Clinical deployment of segmentation models often requires operation under constrained resources. However, existing evaluations focus predominantly on segmentation performance, while failing to balance key computational factors such as model size, inference cost, and speed. This disconnect makes it difficult to assess real-world deployability. To bridge this gap, we introduce U-Score, unified metric that quantifies the trade-off between performance and efficiency using quantile statistics under large-scale benchmark. Specifically, we report the 10th and 90th percentiles of IoU, Params, FLOPs, and FPS, as summarized in Tab. 8 and 9. The formulation is represented as follow. Given model 𝑖, we compute IoU 𝐴𝑖 across datasets, parameter 𝑃𝑖 in millions, FLOPs 𝐺𝑖 in GLOPs, and runtime speed 𝑆𝑖 in FPS. We normalize each component using the 10th and 90th percentiles computed over the model zoo. Let 𝑄𝑀 90 denote the 10th and 90th percentiles of metric 𝑀 . The normalized scores are defined as: 10 and 𝑄𝑀 , 0, 1) , 𝑝𝑖 = clip ( 𝑎𝑖 = clip ( 𝑔𝑖 = clip ( 𝐴𝑖 𝑄𝐴 10 𝑄𝐴 𝑄𝐴 90 10 log 𝑄𝐺 log 𝑄𝐺 90 90 log 𝐺𝑖 log 𝑄𝐺 10 log 𝑄𝑃 log 𝑄𝑃 90 log 𝑃𝑖 log 𝑄𝑃 10 𝑆𝑖 𝑄𝑆 10 𝑄𝑆 𝑄𝑆 10 90 , 0, 1) , , 0, 1) . (1) , 0, 1) , 𝑠𝑖 = clip ( Then, we compute an efficiency subscore via the weighted harmonic mean of 𝑝𝑖, 𝑔𝑖, and 𝑠𝑖. Since we regard storage, cost, and speed as equally important, we set 𝑤𝑃 = 𝑤𝐺 = 𝑤𝑆 = 1 3 , leading to: Eff𝑖 = 3 + 1 𝑔𝑖 1 𝑝𝑖 . + 1 𝑠𝑖 (2) Finally, we combine accuracy and efficiency via harmonic mean. To balance the two factors equally, we set 𝛼 = 0.5, yielding: . (3) U-Score𝑖 = 1 𝑎𝑖 F. Implementation and Evaluation Details F.1. Foreground Characterization Metrics 2 + 1 Eff𝑖 We employ three metrics to characterize dataset-level foreground properties: scale, boundary sharpness, and shape regularity. Foreground scale. Foreground scale is measured as the ratio between the foreground area 𝐴𝑓 and the total image area 𝐴𝑡. 𝐴 = 𝐴𝑓 𝐴𝑡 .

Shape complexity. We quantify the sharpness of the segmented foreground boundaries using composite U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking score 𝑆 derived from two standard geometric descriptors: circularity and solidity. We categorize samples with 𝑆 < 0.5 as irregular, and those with 𝑆 0.5 as regular. The boundary sharpness score 𝑆 is defined as: 𝑆 = 0.5 Circularity + 0.5 Solidity. (5) Circularity measures how close the shape is to perfect circle. It is defined as: Circularity = 4𝜋𝐴𝑓 𝑃 2 , where 𝐴𝑓 is the foreground area and 𝑃 is the perimeter of the contour. Solidity evaluates the extent to which shape fills its convex hull. It is given by: Solidity = 𝐴𝑓 , where 𝐴𝑓 is the foreground area and 𝐴𝑐 is the area of its 𝐴𝑐 convex hull. Boundary Sharpness. We assess boundary sharpness using two complementary measures: boundary width and boundary contrast. Given binary mask 𝑚, we first construct narrow boundary ring by applying morphological dilation and erosion. The boundary width is then computed as the ratio between the area of this ring and the contour perimeter: 𝑤 = Area(Ring) , where 𝑃 denotes the sum of contour perimeters. larger 𝑤 indicates blurrier boundaries, while smaller 𝑤 corresponds to sharper edges. To evaluate intensity separation across the boundary, we form two narrow bands: one inside the mask and one outside, each of width 𝑡 pixels. Let (𝜇𝑖𝑛, 𝜎𝑖𝑛) and (𝜇𝑜𝑢𝑡, 𝜎𝑜𝑢𝑡) denote the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensities inside and outside the boundary band. The boundary contrast is defined as CNR = 𝜇𝑖𝑛𝜇𝑜𝑢𝑡 . To obtain 𝜎𝑖𝑛+𝜎𝑜𝑢𝑡+𝜖 unified measure of boundary clarity, we normalize both 𝑤 and CNR to [0, 1] across the dataset. composite blur score is then computed as: 𝑃 +𝜖 𝐵 = 𝑤𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 𝑤𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 + 𝑐𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 + 𝜖 , (6) where 𝑤𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 and 𝑐𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 are the normalized boundary width and contrast, respectively. We categorize samples with 𝑏 < 0.6 as clear, and those with 𝑏 0.6 as blur. F.2. Model Advisor Agent settings We construct comprehensive feature space that integrates both continuous and discretized descriptors from models and datasets. For model-level attributes, we discretize storage (parameter) into four scales (Tiny: 0-10M, Small: 10-50M, Medium: 50-200M, Large: >200M), computation cost (FLOPs) into three levels (Low: 0-10 GFLOPs, Medium: 10-100 GFLOPs, High: >100 GFLOPs), and inference speed (FPS) into three categories (Slow: <15 FPS, Medium: 15-60 FPS, Fast: >60 FPS). On the data characteristics side, we discretize foreground-related properties:foreground scale (< 0.05 vs. 0.05, denoting small vs. large targets), shape complexity (< 0.5 vs. 0.5, irregular vs. regular), and boundary sharpness (< 0.6 vs. 0.6, clear vs. blurry). We train an XGBRanker with the rank:pairwise objective on 18 in-domain datasets, reserving 2 datasets (BUSI and SkinCancer) for testing. Scores are normalized into relevance values within each dataset, with higher relevance indicating better relative performance. Dataset-level grouping is used to enforce within-dataset ranking consistency during training. At evaluation, the ranker outputs predicted scores, which are converted into ranked lists for each dataset. Performance is assessed using NDCG@50/20 for ranking quality, MAP for precision under binary relevance, and correlation metrics (Spearman) to quantify alignment between predicted and ground-truth orderings. Finally, the agent exports the recommended models per test dataset, providing practical reference list for downstream selection. F.2.1. Data Preprocessing Experimental Data Split. For all experiments on the unified dataset, we used the same train-test split. For data without clear train-test split in the dataset source, we adopted random split; for data with known 24 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking train-test split in the dataset source, we followed the original split. The division method of each dataset is shown in Tab. 4, where denotes our self-defined division and denotes the division consistent with the referenced data source. F.2.2. Retraining Details The experiments are utilizing eight NVIDIA H20 GPUs. total of 100 models are trained with 6000 hours. The implementation was built on Python 3.9.0 and PyTorch 2.7.0. The model structure files are primarily obtained from the open-source code of the original models, with only minor modifications (e.g. input and output channels) to some input parameters to adapt to our framework. Following prior works (Valanarasu and Patel, 2022, Tang et al., 2023, 2024, Chen et al., 2024a, Tang et al., 2025b, Ye et al., 2025, Jiang et al., 2025, Dong et al., 2025), we rescale all images to resolution of 256 256 by default and apply standard data augmentation. For models that require fixed input size (e.g., Swin Transformer variants designed for 224 224 inputs), we preserve their original settings without rescaling. rotations, random horizontal and vertical flips, and normalization. To Augmentations include random 90 ensure fair comparisons, the same preprocessing pipeline is applied consistently across all experiments. Notably, for models that adopt deep supervision, we retain their original training strategy to enable accurate performance evaluation. Table 10: Hyperparameters in U-Bench Optimizer SGD (Momentum=0.9, Weight Decay=0.0001) Learning Rate Epochs Random Seed Batch Size 0.01 300 41 8 F.2.3. Hyper-Parameters in U-Bench Following previous work (Dong et al., 2025, Tang et al., 2024, 2025b, Chen et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2024, Ye et al., 2025), we unify training settings across all models to ensure fair comparisons, as summarized in Tab. 10. Moreover, we use commonly adopted loss configurations (Dong et al., 2025, Tang et al., 2024, 2025b, Ye et al., 2025) to promote generalizable results and enable more equitable performance evaluation. Specifically, for the ground truth 𝑦 and the predicted output ˆ𝑦, the loss function is defined as: ℒ = 0.5 𝐵𝐶𝐸( 𝑦, 𝑦) + 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒( 𝑦, 𝑦), where BCE denotes the binary cross-entropy loss and Dice denotes the Dice loss. Note that for 3D data ACDC and Synapse, we follow CASCADE Rahman and Marculescu (2023a) weights 0.5 𝐵𝐶𝐸( 𝑦, 𝑦), 0.7 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒( 𝑦, 𝑦) (7) F.3. Metrics Intersection over Union (IoU) IoU quantifies the overlap between two regions (predicted 𝐴 and ground-truth 𝐵) as: IoU(𝑌 , 𝑌 ) = 𝑌 𝑌 𝑌 𝑌 (8) , where 𝑌 𝑌 is the area of intersection, and 𝑌 𝑌 is the area of union. U-Score. To address the limitation that existing evaluations primarily focus on segmentation performance while failing to balance key computational factors such as model size, inference cost, and speedâĂŤmaking it 25 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking difficult to assess practical deployment capabilitiesâĂŤwe construct the U-Score based on quantile statistics. detailed description is provided in Appendix E. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) NDCG evaluates the \"usefulness\" of ranked list by accounting for two key factors: (1) the relevance of each item, and (2) the position of relevant items (penalizing lower-ranked relevant items via discounting). It is normalized to range of [0, 1] to enable cross-task comparisons. First, the Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) is defined to measure the cumulative relevance of ranked list up to position 𝑘 (denoted as DCG@𝑘): DCG@𝑘 = 𝑘 𝑖=1 rel𝑖 log2(𝑖 + 1) (9) where: 𝑘: The cutoff position (e.g., 𝑘 = 10 for NDCG@10, focusing on top-10 results). rel𝑖: The relevance score of the 𝑖-th item in the ranked list. For binary relevance (relevant/irrelevant). log2(𝑖 + 1): The discount factor, which reduces the contribution of items ranked later (since users are less likely to inspect lower positions). To normalize DCG across different queries/tasks (where the maximum possible relevance varies), the Ideal DCG (IDCG)âĂŤthe maximum possible DCG@k for given set of itemsâĂŤis computed by ranking all relevant items in descending order of rel𝑖: IDCG@𝑘 = min(𝑘,𝑅) 𝑖=1 rel 𝑖 log2(𝑖 + 1) (10) where: 𝑅: The set of all relevant items for the query/task. 𝑅: The total number of relevant items. rel 𝑖: The 𝑖-th highest relevance score among all items in 𝑅 (i.e., the ideal ranking). NDCG@k is defined as the ratio of DCG@k to IDCG@k. To avoid division by zero (when no relevant items exist, IDCG@𝑘 = 0), NDCG@k is set to 0 in this edge case: NDCG@𝑘 = { 0 DCG@𝑘 IDCG@𝑘 if IDCG@𝑘 = 0, otherwise. (11) For experiments with multiple queries/tasks (e.g., retrieval dataset with 1k queries), the mean NDCG@kâĂŤthe average of NDCG@k across all queriesâĂŤis reported. In Table 3, NDCG@k values for 𝑘 = 5 and 𝑘 = 20 are provided. Mean Average Precision (MAP) MAP quantifies the average precision of relevant items in ranked list, aggregated across all queries/tasks. It is particularly useful for scenarios where \"early relevant items\" (high precision at top positions) are critical (e.g., information retrieval, recommendation systems). U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking First, Average Precision (AP) for single query 𝑞 is defined as the average of the precision of the ranked list at the position of each relevant item: AP(𝑞) = 1 𝑅𝑞 𝑟𝑅𝑞 Prec(𝑘𝑟) (12) where: 𝑞: single query (or task instance) from the query set 𝑄; 𝑅𝑞: The set of all relevant items for query 𝑞 (if 𝑅𝑞 = 0, AP(𝑞) = 0 by convention); 𝑘𝑟: The position of relevant item 𝑟 in the ranked list for 𝑞; Prec(𝑘𝑟): The precision at position 𝑘𝑟, defined as Prec(𝑘𝑟) = numRel(𝑘𝑟) of relevant items in the top-𝑘𝑟 positions. , where numRel(𝑘𝑟) is the number 𝑘𝑟 For set of 𝑄 queries, MAP is the average of AP scores across all queries: MAP = 1 𝑄 𝑞𝑄 AP(𝑞) (13) Similar to NDCG, MAP ranges from [0, 1]: value of 1 indicates all relevant items are ranked first (perfect precision at every relevant position), while 0 indicates no relevant items are retrieved. Spearmans Rank Correlation Coefficient Spearmans rank correlation coefficient quantifies the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables. It is particularly useful for evaluating how well the order of items (e.g., predicted rankings by model and ground-truth rankings) aligns, making it relevant for tasks where the consistency of relative ordering matters (e.g., comparing ranked recommendations or human judgments). Formally, Spearmans rank correlation coefficient 𝜌 between two variables 𝑋 (e.g., model-generated ranks) and 𝑌 (e.g., ground-truth ranks) (each with 𝑛 paired observations) is defined as: where: 𝜌 = 1 6 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑑2 𝑖 𝑛(𝑛2 1) 𝑑𝑖: The difference between the rank of 𝑋𝑖 and the rank of 𝑌𝑖 (i.e., 𝑑𝑖 = rank(𝑋𝑖) rank(𝑌𝑖)). 𝑛: The total number of paired observations.

As shown in Tab. 11 and Tab. 12. For reference, the position of the vanilla U-Net is highlighted with gray background, and we also compute the statistical significance of each variant relative to U-Net. Top10 performance on Source domain. On widely studied datasets and modalities-such as ultrasound, polyp segmentation, ISIC2018 (Dermoscopy), Synapse (CT), Drive (Fundus), ACDC (MRI), and Covidquex (X-ray)-most top-10 variants achieve significant improvements over U-Net. This trend is consistent with the increasing popularity of these datasets and novelity desion for long-range dependency modeling, such as incorporating Transformers, Mamba, RWKV, and hybrid designs. In contrast, on other datasets and modalities the improvements remain marginal. For example, in Montgomery (X-ray lung segmentation), DCA, Chase (Fundus), nuclear segmentation, and Histopathology, the relative gains over U-Net are not significant. This suggests that progress in these modalities has been limited, because they rely on stable local patterns rather than long-range context. These observations highlight an important direction for future research: designing models that are modality-aware, particularly tailored for domains dominated by local 28 U-Bench: Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking Table 12: Top-10 performing variants across each dataset on target domains.

On the target-domain datasets, nearly all top-10 methods achieve substantial improvements, highlighting the superior generalization ability of recent variants. These gains are primarily driven by two factors: the adoption of long-range dependency modeling and the increased model complexity. Together, these characteristics enhance the representational capacity and adaptability of the variants, which aligns with the prevailing trend toward more novel and increasingly complex model architectures. In addition, we provide the visualization results of the top 5 models and U-net of the dataset for visualization analysis.

Incorporate New Datasets and Algorithms in U-Stone We implement U-Stone using the PyTorch framework. Figure 10 illustrates the comprehensive workflow of U-Stone, system tailored for medical image analysis. It features versatile 2D/3D Dataloader that seamlessly accommodates multiple medical imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, X-Ray, Dermoscopy, and Fundus and so on. rich assortment of models with diverse architectural designs-spanning CNN, Transformer, RWKV, Mamba, and Hybrid-are registered via Model JSON configuration and then leveraged by the Trainer module for 2D/3D slice-wise training. The evaluation pipeline encompasses in-domain testing, zero-shot inference, statistical significance assessments and custom assessments of U-score. Finally, results are systematically logged and visualized using tools such as Weight & Biases (wandb), ensuring thorough tracking of metrics and checkpoints. We demonstrate how to integrate new datasets and algorithms through example pseudocode Figure 11. H.1. Adding New Dataset If the existing Dataset classes cannot meet your processing requirements, you can implement your own dataset with the structure shown as in Figure 11 (a). Additionally, you need to add your dataset name and loading method in the Dataloader file, as shown in the Figure 11 (b). H.2. Adding New Algorithm 1. First, define your model in the models directory, ensuring the first two parameters are input_channel and num_classes to adapt to our project (as shown in Figure 11 (c)). 2. Then, properly import your \"modelname\" in the __init__.py file under the models directory. 3. Finally, register your model in the model_id.json file with the format shown in Figure 11 (d). Note that modelname, id, and deep_supervision are required fields, and modelname serves as the unique identifier for the model. Figure 10: Overall workflow of U-Stone. The Dataloader supports multiple medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, X-Ray, Dermoscopy, Fundus). Models (with diverse architectures like CNN, Transformer, RWKV, Mamba, Hybrid) are registered and used by the Trainer for 2D/3D slice training.
