INTRODUCTION Legged robots are often regarded as the ideal embodiment of robotic systems, designed to perform wide range of tasks and navigate diverse destinations. Many of these tasks, such as skateboarding and boxing, are inherently contact-guided, involving complex sequences of contact events [1]. Designing and executing such contact-guided control is highly non-trivial due to two major challenges: (1) the hybrid dynamics system problem arising from the abrupt transitions introduced by contact events [2], and (2) the sparsity of contact events, which poses significant difficulties for both model-based and modelfree control strategies. In model-based control, Hybrid Automata has been proposed as powerful framework to model systems with both discrete and continuous dynamics [3, 4]. This framework has been widely applied to behavior planning [5] and legged locomotion. However, due to the combinatorial nature of hybrid dynamics, finding optimal policies for hybrid systems through model-based optimization is computationally challenging, especially for tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces. In contrast, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving optimal control problems (OCP) for robotics by modeling transition dynamics as Markov Decision Process (MDP) and maximizing accumulated rewards. Model-free RL requires minimal assumptions and can be applied to diverse range of tasks across different dynamic systems [6, 7]. However, RL policies, often represented by deep neural networks, lack interpretability and fail to explicitly model hybrid dynamics [8]. Furthermore, contactguided tasks pose additional challenges for RL due to the inherent sparsity of contact events [1]. Sampling inefficiency in RL often leads to suboptimal learning, and existing continuous transitions mapping policies struggle to handle the abrupt characteristic of hybrid dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose novel perspective for solving contact-guided tasks by explicitly incorporating hybrid dynamics systems into the learning framework. Our approach explicitly models the flow dynamics of different modes as well as the transitions between them. Unlike prior model-free methods that rely on aggressive exploration to achieve sparse rewards, our framework focuses on improving sample efficiency in the action space, minimizing the risk of unstable or unsafe behaviors. To validate our method, we tackle the challenging task to skateboard. This task of enabling quadrupedal robot exemplifies highly dynamic, contact-guided, and hybrid underactuated system, requiring precise handling of mode transitions and contact events. The key contributions of this work are summarized as follows: 1) Discrete Hybrid Automata Framework: We propose discrete hybrid automata framework for online reinforcement learning that eliminates the need for explicit trajectory segmentation or event labeling. 2) Contact-guided task design: We combined multi-critic architecture and beta distribution to effectively address contact-guided problem in hybrid systems. 3) Sim2Real of Underactuated Skateboarding motion: We achieved agile and robust sim-to-real performance in the highly underactuated and hybrid task of skateboard motion. II. RELATED WORK A. Legged Robot Control The Model Predictive Control (MPC) [9, 10, 11] with simplified single rigid body has been successfully applied to motion planning of legged robot[12, 13, 14, 15], achieving robust locomotion on flat ground under diverse gait patterns. Corb`eres et al. [12], Grandia et al. [13] further integrated motion planning and perception, enabling quadruped robots to navigate complex terrains. However, such approaches are highly dependent on accurate global state estimation, which poses limitations in outdoor and long-range scenarios. Additionally, the gait pattern of model-based approach are designed manually, which can not scale in complicated scenarios. In contrast to the model-based approach, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in legged robot control, including high-speed locomotion [16, 17, 18, 19], complex terrain traversal [20, 21, 22, 23], manipulation, and interaction [24, 25, 26]. The main focus of RL-based quadruped control in recent years is in the paradigm of sim-to-real transfer [27, 22], safe reinforcement learning [18], and gait control [28, 29, 30]. In this paper, we primarily focus on the exploration of sparse motion patterns and the embedding of hybrid dynamics learning. B. Contact-guided locomotion pattern The hybrid nature of contact dynamics makes it challenging to synthesize optimal motions for contact-rich tasks. In modelbased methods, the discontinuities introduced by contact create obstacles for gradient-based optimization. Kim et al. [31] and [32, 33] address this issue by formulating it as linear complementarity problem (LCP) and relaxing the complementarity constraints, while Westervelt et al. [3] adopt hybrid dynamic system combined with automata to handle contact. In the realm of reinforcement learning (RL), the specification of sparse or contact-guided motion patterns has not been widely investigated or solved, such as explicitly prescribing contact-based motion [1] or relying solely on key frame trajectory tracking [34]. Considering real-world robot collisions and constraints, sparse reward design in high-dimensional sampling space severely limits effective exploration [1]. In contrast, under multi-critic framework [34] combined with Beta action distribution [35], this paper achieves contactspecified skateboarding motion on quadruped robot, with on-the-fly adjustments of the gait pattern. C. Hybrid Dynamics Hybrid dynamic systems are employed to describe systems that feature both continuous states and discrete modes, and they are widely used in model-based control and cyberphysical systems [36]. For instance, floating-base robots are often treated as hybrid dynamic systems due to the discontinuities and jumps caused by contact. Recently, Ly and Lipson [8], Chen et al. [2], Poli et al. [37], Teng et al. [38] have leveraged data-driven approaches to construct either discrete or continuous hybrid dynamic systems. Unlike previous work, we integrate Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid Dynamics, enabling the robot to learn Hybrid Dynamics Automaton for explicit mode switching and control without requiring labels or segmentation. III. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM SETTING For clarity and reference, Table provides an overview of the key symbols and abbreviations used throughout this paper. A. Markov Decision Process We model the robot control problem as an infinite-horizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), composed by tuple = (S, O, A, p, r, γ), with st the full states, ot the partial observation of the agents from the environment, at the action the agent can take to interact with the environments, and p(st+1st, at) the transition function of state st. Each transition is rewarded by Fig. 2: Discrete-time Hybrid Dynamics Learning (DHAL) Framework: (a) During training, the network learns to select the mode and activate the corresponding dynamics module (yellow-highlighted) to predict transition dynamics and contact. Here, Pi represents the probability of the robot being in mode at time t. (b) The temporal features extracted by the encoder are combined with the current state and last action into the actor. The actor update α, β, which define the probability density function of the Beta distribution, and then samples joint actions from the Beta distribution. (c) In real-world deployment, we use different LED colors to indicate the active modes, showcasing smooth transitions and mode-specific behaviors. reward function : with γ representing discount factor. The Reinforcement Learning optimization objective is to maximize the expected total return (cid:104)(cid:80)T (cid:105) . t=0 γtrt B. Discrete Hybrid Dynamical System Though incorporating dynamic information into policies can potentially enhance performance,, most existing approaches assume single dynamics model for legged robots, overlooking their inherently hybrid nature. To address this limitation, we aim to integrate information of the hybrid dynamical systems into policy learning to achieve superior performance. Hybrid dynamical system involves both discrete and continuous dynamics or states. The system has continuous flow in each discrete mode and can jump between these modes [39, 37]. Although utilizing set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with transition maps modeled by neural networks has shown some promising results [37, 2], the continuous integration is computational consuming for RL and not wellcompatible for real-world robotic control, which is digital control system. In this work, inspired by Borrelli et al. [40] and Ly and Lipson [8], we adopt discrete hybrid automata to model the dynamics of legged robots, which naturally exhibit hybrid behaviors. For simplicity of embedding discrete hybrid automata into the reinforcement learning framework, we utilize the concept of switched affine system to model the hybrid dynamics for legged robots. However, we utilize set of nonlinear functions instead of affine functions to model the dynamics in each mode for legged robots. The dynamics of the legged robot can be described as st+1 = it(st, at), (1) where st Rn is the states, at Rm is the input, it = {1, 2, ..., K} is the modes at time step t, it : Rn Rm Rn is the dynamics on mode i. The mode it is determined by an extra mode selector. We assume that all states of the system are continuous-valued, not considering any discrete-valued state. Dynamics for each mode is unique, i.e., = j, i, I. The maximum number of mode is assumed to be known. In this work, we use neural networks to model both the dynamics and the automata (mode selector), aiming to extract latent representation that informs the actor. To maintain consistency with the stochastic nature of the MDP, we utilize β-VAE to model the state transition in equation (1). Unlike hybrid systems described by continuous flow [39, 37], we omit the explicit jump mapping between different modes, as it is captured within the discrete-time dynamics (1). C. Environment Design To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we aimed to select challenging environment that involves complex mode transitions and contact-rich dynamics. Inspired by the real-world example of dogs learning to ride skateboards, we identified the task of robotic dog skateboarding as highly demanding scenario. This task presents distinct hybrid dynamics challenges, such as the significant differences between the gliding mode and the pushing mode. We believe this represents highly worthwhile and meaningful challenge for validating TABLE I: Important symbols and abbreviations Meaning Symbol POMDP Full State Partial Observation Action State Space Action Space Discount Factor st ot at γ Hybrid Dynamics System Discrete-time dynamics Mode index Number of modes Jacobian Probability of each mode mode indicator vector maximum number of modes it it δ = δ Environment Joint Position Joint Velocity Go1 Base Roll, Pitch,Yaw Go1 Base angular velocity Gravity Action Phase Command Proprioception Contact Torque (cid:104) (cid:104) = = qF L/F R/RL/RR Hip,T high,Calf qF L/F R/RL/RR Hip,T high,Calf ϕ, θ, ψ ωx, ωy, ωz gx,y,z aF L/F R/RL/RR Hip,T high,Calf (cid:104) = (cid:105) (cid:105) (cid:105) Φ cmd = [cx, cyaw] = [q, q, gx,y,z, ϕ, θ, ψ, ωx, ωy, ωz] τ our method. Our method is not limited to the skateboarding task but can also be expanded to other scenarios. In this paper, we conducted experiments using the Unitree Go1 robot and normal skateboard for men. The Unitree Go1 has dimensions of 645 mm 280 mm 400 mm when standing and 540 mm 290 mm 130 mm when folded. The skateboard used in our experiments measures 800 mm 254 mm 110 mm. The Unitree Go1 is equipped with 12 actuated joints. Although it lacks the spinal degrees of freedom present in real quadrupedal animals, our experimental results demonstrate that it can still effectively control the skateboards movement. To accelerate the training process and simplify the design of the redundant system, we connected the end of the Unitree Go1s left forelimb to the skateboard using spherical joint in simulation, providing passive degrees of freedom along the x, y, and axes. Unlike Chen et al. [41], The wheels of the skateboard can only passively rotate around their respective axes. Additionally, we simulated the skateboards truck mechanism in the simulation using position PD controller to replicate its mechanical behavior. IV. METHODS We introduce DHAL, as shown in Fig. 2, to illustrate the proposed controller [3] that leverages the model-based hybrid dynamics. More specifically: i. Discrete-time Hybrid Automata, discrete mode selector, to identify at each step time the one-hot latent mode of the system. ii. Dynamics Encoder, based on the mode chosen from the chosen dynamics discrete-time hybrid automata, encoder will be activated and get tight representation of flow dynamics. iii. Dynamics Decoder, to decode the representation and predict transition dynamics ot+1 and contact event ct+1. iv. Controller, based on the tight representation from the dynamics encoder and observation at the current moment, control robot to perform skateboarding. A. Discrete Neural Hybrid Automata Previous research has explored modifications to the framework of reinforcement learning, such as incorporating estimators to predict transition dynamics [23]. However, prior work has not explicitly considered and addressed the issue of dynamics with mode switching. The dynamics of legged robots inherently exhibit hybrid behavior due to contact events, as illustrated in Fig. 3. We model the contact as perfect inelastic collision, which means the velocity of the contact point instantaneously drops to zero from nonzero value. Consequently, the robots state also undergoes discrete jump, resulting in hybrid dynamics formulation. To illustrate this, consider simplified example of single 3-DoF leg attached to fixed base. The velocity of the contact point is given by vc = Jc(q) q, (2) where vc R3 is the linear velocity of the contact point, R3 is the joint angular Jc(q) R33 is the Jacobian, velocity. In most cases, Jc(q) is invertible, implying discontinuity in vc directly induces discontinuity in q. This simple example highlights the inherent hybrid nature of legged robot dynamics. Fig. 3: Switching of hybrid system with inelastic collision. When the leg makes contact with the ground, the linear velocity will abruptly drop to zero. In this work, we aim to extract latent representation of the dynamics for the controller. To achieve this, we model the dynamics for each mode and design discrete-time hybrid automata (DHA) to determine which dynamic is active at any given time, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Since only partial observations ot are available in practice, rather than the full state st, we consider partial discrete-time dynamics. As discussed in Sec. III-B, we employ β-VAE instead of deterministic dynamics model to better align with the stochastic nature of reinforcement learning. This process can be expressed by it = fDHA(otk:t, atk1:t1; θDHA) ot+1, ct+1 = it dec it enc(otk:t, atk1:t1; θvae). (3) where it {1, 2, ..., K} is the mode for current time t, which is determined by state-action sequence (otk:t, atk1:t1). ct+1 represents the contact information for each foot, see (7). The maximal number of modes is pre-defined. The next partial state ot+1 and contact information ct+1 is determined by β-VAE at mode i, taking the same input as the hybrid automata. key advantage of the β-VAE is that it directly provides latent representation of the dynamics. In conventional switched affine systems [13], the hybrid automata relies on multiple modules. In contrast, our approach simplifies it to single network that takes window of past state-action as input. Specifically, The hybrid automata is designed to output one-hot latent, making this classification problem. To determine the mode, we employ combination of softmax classifier and categorical sampling. First, the probability distribution over modes is computed as = fsoftmax fDHA_logit(otk:t, atk1:t1; θDHA) (4) where is the probability for each mode, fsoftmax is the softmax loss, flogit is the logit function, θDHA represents the parameters of the DHA neural network. Next, categorical sampling is applied to to obtain one-hot latent vector δ, which indicates the selected dynamics mode: δ Categorical(p), (cid:88) i=1 δi = 1, δi {0, 1} (5) where δi = 1 represents the mode is it = i. With the hybrid automata, we build corresponding dynamics β-VAEs for modes. For each mode, the β-VAE encodes the historical trajectory and extracts the time-sequence feature into latent representation, which will be subsequently decoded into the next partial state ot+1. The latent representation in β-VAE encodes substantial dynamics information; hence, we then use it in the controller. For the encoder, we adopt transformer architecture due to its superior ability to capture temporal dependencies, which can be expressed by Fig. 4: Multi-Critic Skateboard Task We train the mode selector and the β-VAE simultaneously as (3), where the mode is self-determined by constructing the loss function as Lvae = (cid:88) MSE(ˆot+1, ot+1)+BCE(ˆct+1, ct+1)+βLKL), (8) where ot+1, ct+1 are the ground truth values, MSE represents mean-square-error loss, BCE represents binary-cross-entropy loss. The KL divergence prevents the encoder from fitting the data too flexibly and encourages the distribution of the latent variable to be close to unit Gaussian, while β is used to control the trade-off scale. The hybrid automata is trained by minimizing the prediction error of ot+1, ct+1, where the correct mode label will result in lower prediction error. Such unsupervised learning does not require ground truth for mode labels. The discrete categorical sample results in discontinuity of gradients, we apply the straight-through-gradient method [43] to realize backpropagation during the training. Moreover, the gradient of the discrete-time automata is independent of PPO, ensuring accurate mode identification. However, the gradient backpropagates through the encoder to extract useful temporal features. In addition, we encourage the mode to be distinguished by minimizing the information entropy of the mode probability p, resulting in the final loss: zt = (cid:88) i=1 δi it enc(otk:t, atk1:t1; θenc), (6) LDHA = Lvae + H(p), (9) where zt Rn is the latent representation, and the mode selector is included using δ. The decoder then uses this representation to predict ot+1, ct+1, which can be expressed by ˆot+1, ˆct+1 = (cid:88) i=1 δi it dec(zt; θdec), (7) where ct+1 [0, 1]n is the probability that each leg is in contact at time + 1. We include contact information to make learning hybrid switching easier for the networks. Typically, The ground truth for mode label and partial states are required to train these two neural networks [37]; however, the mode label is hard to obtain even in simulation. To address this, motivated by Mitchell et al. [42], we utilize the unsupervised learning method to train the mode selector. where represents information entropy, aiming to ensure that the modes probabilities are as distinct as possible and to prevent confusion between different modes. Compared to [37] that models hybrid dynamics using continuous flow approach, we adopt discrete-time formulation. This formulation unifies mode switching and dynamics within single framework rather than treating them separately. Furthermore, unlike [37] that requires pre-segmentation of the trajectories to distinguish the mode, our method integrates mode selection directly into the training process, streamlining the entire workflow. The detailed network architecture and hyper-parameters can be found in the Appendix. B. Multi Critic Reinforcement Learning Inspired by Zargarbashi et al. [34], Xing et al. [44], we adopt the concept of multi-critic learning and apply it to the design of multi-task objectives for different motion phases. Designing an intuitive reward function for the robotic dog to perform skateboarding maneuvers is challenging. Therefore, we leverage sparse contact-based rewards to guide the robot in executing smooth pushing motions and gliding on the skateboardtwo distinctly different movement patterns. Unlike the approach in Fu et al. [45], where minimizing energy consumption is prioritized, we found that this approach struggles to naturally induce the gliding motion. This difficulty arises because skateboarding, compared to standard quadrupedal locomotion, has much smaller stability margin. As result, the robot tends to avoid using the skateboard altogether to minimize energy loss rather than embracing it as part of the task. To address this challenge, we design two distinct tasks corresponding to different phases of the cycle: gliding and pushing. During the pushing phase, the robots primary objective is to track the desired speed, while during the gliding phase, its goal is to maintain balance and glide smoothly on the skateboard. Although we specify the motion phase transitions using cyclic signals during training to ensure balanced learning of both tasks, in real-world deployment, these cyclic signals can be adapted on the fly or generated based on the robots velocity. The cyclic signal serves as an indicator to inform the robot with which movement pattern to adopt. However, because the speed-tracking rewards and regularization terms for sim-to-real adaptation are dense, while the contact-related rewards are inherently sparse at the early stages of exploration, using single critic to estimate the value of all rewards can lead to the sparse rewards advantages being diluted by the dense rewards during normalization. This makes it difficult for the robot to learn the desired different style behaviors [34]. To mitigate this and generate different style motions, we introduce multi-critic framework, as illustrated in Fig. 4. We define three reward groups, each associated with different critic: Gliding Critic: Responsible for evaluating rewards related to gliding, such as speed tracking. Pushing Critic: Focused on sparse contact-related rewards during the pushing phase. Sim2Real Critic: Responsible for rewards related to simto-real adaptation, such as action regularization. Each critic is updated separately to estimate its value function. When calculating the overall advantage, the three critics outputs are normalized and combined using weighted summation. Similar to Zargarbashi et al. [34], the weights for each critics advantage are treated as hyperparameters. This approach reduces the sensitivity to reward tuning, thereby simplifying the reward design process. Specifically, the reward function are presented in Table. II and their values are in Appendix A. C. Beta Distribution Policy In quadrupedal locomotion tasks, the mainstream frameworks typically assume Gaussian distribution as the policy distribution in PPO due to its intuitive parameterization and TABLE II: Summary of Reward Terms and Their Expressions. Each term is multiplied by its phase coefficient (δglide or δpush) if it belongs to specific phase, and scaled by as listed in the text.

However, when the action space has strict bounds (e.g., joint position limits to prevent collisions in quadrupedal robots), the Gaussian distribution can introduce bias in policy optimization by producing out-of-bound actions that need to be clipped [35]. While this issue has been noted in prior work, it has not been widely addressed in the context of robotic locomotion. We observe that the Beta distribution offers significant advantage over the Gaussian distribution in effectively utilizing the action space under sparse reward conditions. In contrast, Gaussian policies may increase the variance excessively in an attempt to explore more of the action space to trigger potential sparse rewards. This aggressive strategy can lead to suboptimal performance, getting stuck in local optima, and even result in hardware damage and safety hazards during real-world deployment. Therefore, we introduce the Beta distribution as the policy distribution for our framework. In our implementation, the policy outputs the shape parameters (α, β) of the Beta distribution for each joint independently. To ensure that the Beta distribution remains unimodal (α > 1, β > 1), we modify the activation function as follows: SoftplusWithOffset(x) = Softplus(x) + 1 + 106 (10) The standard Beta distribution is defined over [0, 1]: (x; α, β) = Γ(α + β) Γ(α)Γ(β) xα1(1 x)β1, α, β > 0 (11) To adapt this to the robots action space [amax, amax] where amax > 0, we apply the following transformation: B(α, β), = 2amax amax (12) In the expression, the denote the true action will be executed by robot. This approach enables the policy to produce bounded, valid actions within the desired range, preventing out-of-bound behaviors while making full use of the action space. We provide proof in the Appendix demonstrating that our method does not introduce bias or result in variance explosion. V. EXPERIMENTS In this section, the purpose of our experiment is to verify whether our method can achieve the following behaviors: Q1: Why Hybrid Dynamics System is better than Single Dynamics modeling? Q2: Can our method identify the mode of skateboarding? Q3: Can our method achieve skateboarding in the realworld with disturbances? A. Prediction of Dynamics To answer Q1, We apply comparison on dynamics prediction loss between different maximal modes, corresponding to dimension of mode indicator δ. Among these modes, the condition where number of mode δ equals to 1 represents that using one network to model whole dynamics like [23]. We trained each condition three times with random seeds for network initialization. As shown in Fig. 6, the curve shows the average reconstruction loss under different modes. When the maximum number of modes is 1, the loss is the highest. After incorporating the hybrid dynamics idea, different modes are switched to guide the conversion and mutation of flow dynamics, the reconstruction loss is smaller. Starting from the maximum number of modes 2, the improvement in prediction accuracy begins to plateau. it This is consistent with our assumption that is more reasonable to build the system as hybrid dynamics system in system with mutation and other properties. Considering that the two main states of the skateboard are the skateboard up and the skateboard down, when δ 2, there is marginal effect of improvement. When δ 4, the prediction accuracy can hardly be improved and converges to the state of mode=3. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we believe that mode Fig. 5: Trajectory Prediction Visualization: The comparison between the actual position trajectory (solid line) and the predicted position trajectory (dashed line) for the right front leg joint motor of the physical Go1 robot during skateboarding is shown. We selected the right front leg joint, which exhibits the largest range of motion, as the visualization target. During deployment, the system utilizes the mode selection results from the automata to choose the corresponding decoder for prediction, consistent with the training process. Fig. 6: Dynamics Prediction Loss: The agents dynamics prediction loss MSE(ˆot+1, ot+1) during training is shown in the figure, where the thick line represents the average loss, and the shaded regions indicate the confidence intervals across different seeds. count of 3 is the reasonable number of modes for this system, which corresponds to three motion modes: on the skateboard, pushing the skateboard under the skateboard, and being in the air between the two. We will showcase the mode identification in the next section V-B. To validate the accuracy of the predicted dynamics, we deployed our DHAL algorithm on the physical robot and recorded both the predicted dynamics and the actual dynamics in real time. In this experiment, we applied clock signal with fixed period of 2.5 seconds to the controller, alternating the skateboards upward and downward movements. Notably, this clock signal differs from the one used during the training phase (4s), providing an additional test for the accuracy of the predicted dynamics under new conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, even in the absence of ut, the representation obtained only from xtk:t can accurately predict the robots trajectory and jumps. In the next section, we will evaluate our methods capability for mode identification and its ability to adjust phases on the fly. Fig. 7: Effectiveness of mode identification. In real-world deployment, we light up different RGB light bar colors according to the mode to show the switching between different mode. The following figure shows the change in joint position relative to time in the test, and the background color is represented by the color of the corresponding mode. [H, T, C] denote the Hip, Thigh, and Calf Joints, respectively. phase, the automata naturally transition the mode to mode 1 (green). This brief transition corresponds to the sharp change in joint angles shown in the figure. Once both of the robots right legs are fully in contact with the ground, the automata switch to mode 2 (blue). This sequence of mode selections and transitions is smooth and explicitly aligns with the decomposition of skateboarding motion: (1) gliding phase, (2) airborne phase transitioning on and off the skateboard, and (3) pushing phase. These results demonstrate that our hybrid automata make mode selections that are highly consistent with physical intuition. Additionally, we applied t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of the hidden layer outputs from the controllers neural network. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the latent space exhibits clearly defined distribution across different modes. Interestingly, the resulting latent structure is remarkably similar to that reported in [42]. Specifically, the red region primarily corresponds to the data collected during the robots movements on the skateboard, the blue region represents states where the right two legs are in contact with the ground during pushing, and the green region corresponds to the airborne phases when transitioning on and off the skateboard. This observation highlights two key points: (1) our controller effectively handles motion control tasks across different modes, and (2) our DHAL module can distinctly and accurately differentiate between various modes. C. Performance on Skateboarding To answer Q3, this section presents ablation studies and real-world experiments to evaluate our method. The analysis Fig. 8: Visualization of hidden layer of the controller: Scatter points in different colors correspond to the different modes identified by the system, consistent with Fig. 7. Specifically, [green, blue, red] represent [mode 1, mode 2, mode 3], respectively. B. Mode Identification To answer Q2, we collected real-world trajectories of the robot skateboarding along with the modes selected by the controller for visualization, as shown in Fig. 7. Additionally, we used different RGB LED colors to represent the dynamic modules selected by the hybrid automata. From the figure, it is visually evident that when the robot is in the gliding phase, with all four feet standing firmly on the skateboard, the hybrid automata classify this state as mode 3 (red). When the robots right front foot starts to lift off the ground and enters the swing Fig. 9: Comparison of Training Rewards: Comparison of mean reward during training is shown in the figure, where the thick line represents the average return, and the shaded regions indicate the maximal and minimal reward across different seeds. Each method was trained using four random seeds to evaluate performance. is divided into the following parts: (1) Comparison of training returns, (2) Comparison between single-critic method, and (3) Experiments in real-world scenarios with disturbances, including success rate statistics. Comparison of training returns: Since the skateboarding task is designed to be contact-guided, the training process exhibits significant randomness, leading to considerable variance in training curves even for the same method. Therefore, the primary goals of this experiment are: (1) to identify the key factors driving successful training, and (2) to evaluate whether our method can approach optimal performance. For comparative evaluation, we compared the following algorithms with access to proprioceptions only: 1) PPO-oracle-beta: Training policy with full privileged observations and the Beta distribution. 2) DreamWaq [23]: Training an dynamics module to estimate velocity and future observation. 3) PPO-curiosity [46, 1]: Training directly with only proprioception and following the curiosity reward design[1]. As shown in Fig. 9, our method could achieve comparable performance with PPO-oracle-beta, which has privileged observation about skateboard information. Notably, for the methods with Gaussian distribution, the robot cannot learn how to do skateboarding even leading to dangerous motion, infeasible. The result which makes real-world deployment aligns with the discussion in IV-C: in environments with high exploration difficulty, Gaussian distributions tend to prioritize increasing variance to expand the exploration range, thereby randomly encountering reward points. However, due to the physical constraints of the robot, this exploration strategy introduces bias, causing Gaussian distribution policies to favor movements closer to the constraints and ultimately leading to failure [35]. Comparison with single-critic: We trained both our multicritic method and the single-critic method for comparison. Since our multi-critic approach normalizes the advantages of different reward groups and combines them through weighted Fig. 10: Comparison between single-critic policy and multi-critic policy: Single-critic-wo-transfer (A1 A3), Single-critic-w-transfer (B1 B3), ours (C1 C3). summation, while the single-critic approach lacks this weighting advantage mechanism, we evaluated two configurations of the single-critic method: Single-critic-w-transfer: single-critic setup with the same reward configuration as the multi-critic method, but with new reward weights transferred based on the advantage weights Single-critic-wo-transfer: single-critic setup with the same reward configuration and weights as the multi-critic method As shown in Fig. 10, For the single-critic approach without transferred weights, the robot exhibited aggressive and erratic movements, making it difficult to handle disturbances. During forward motion, excessive hyperflexion at the foot caused it to get stuck, and when mounting the skateboard, the hind legs often slipped off. In contrast, the single-critic approach with transferred weights managed to successfully mount the skateboard. However, during the pushing phase, the robot primarily relied on its hind legs, leaving the front legs suspended for extended periods, resulting in an unnatural gliding posture. With our multi-critic training scheme, the robot achieved smooth and natural motion, efficiently executing rapid pushing and demonstrating significantly more stable and graceful transitions on and off the skateboard. We obtained results similar to Mysore et al. [47], demonstrating that the multicritic approach is well-suited for multi-style learning. Quantitative Experiments: We conducted quantitative experiments in real-world scenarios to evaluate whether our method can successfully complete the skateboarding task under real-world noise and disturbances. These disturbances include, but are not limited to, sensor noise, skateboard property variations, terrain irregularities, and dynamics noise [22]. Using the trained model, we tested the following scenarios: (1) smooth ceramic flooring, (2) soft carpeted flooring, (3) disturbance, (4) slope terrain, (5) single-step terrain, (6) uneven terrain. Each scenario was tested ten times, with each test containing at least one full cycle of mounting and dismounting the skateboard. The test terrain is shown in Fig. 1 and success rate statistics are shown in Table. III. More extreme terrain TABLE III: Succes Rate Comparison: We deployed each method on real robot to evaluate the success rate. Each method was tested five times least one full upper scenarios. Success was defined as completing at board and down-board motions, traverse over distance of more than 5 meters, and avoiding abrupt movements or detachment from the skateboard. indicates complete failure(Massive torque caused the joints protection state, for hardware protection, we first test torque value in simulation to make sure it will no exceed safty range).

VI. LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSION 1. Perception Limitations: To connect the robots left front foot to the skateboard, we assumed spherical joint to prevent the skateboard from completely detaching from the robot. The transition from walking to skateboarding presents significantly greater challenge, requiring hardware modifications, such as adjusting the camera layout and incorporating multiple cameras to locate the skateboard. Furthermore, we did not consider obstacle avoidance during skateboarding using perception-based methods. Initially, we attempted to use the Realsense T265 for state estimation but later determined that it was unnecessary for this task. However, for future work, when the foot is not fixed to the board, the state estimation methods [48, 49, 50, 51, 52] need to be carefully integrated. 2. Complex skill Generalization: Our method cannot generalize to extreme skateboarding techniques equivalent to those of human athletes, such as performing an ollie. The current simulation setup cannot accurately replicate the motion and contact dynamics of passive wheels in such challenging scenarios. Instead, we relied on approximations and alternative techniques to simulate these dynamics as realistically as possible. 3. Limitations in Dynamics Learning: The learned dynamics are not yet precise enough for model-based control. Furthermore, the coupling between the controller and the dynamics predictor prevents iterative optimization, such as that used in MPC, limiting the flexibility and efficiency of our approach. 4. Non-Trivial Environment Design: The environment setting and design for robot skateboarding in non-trivial. This part requires manual design and inspection. We believe that in the future, integrating environment generation with large models [53] could potentially help address this challenge. VII. CONCLUSION We proposed the Discrete-time Hybrid Automata Learning (DHAL) framework to address mode-switching in hybrid dynamical systems without requiring trajectory segmentation or event function modeling. By combining multi-critic architecture and Beta distribution policy, our method demonstrates robust handling of contact-guided hybrid dynamics, as validated through the challenging task of quadrupedal robot skateboarding. Real-world experiments showed that our approach achieves smooth and intuitive mode transitions, effectively balancing gliding and pushing behaviors. While limitations remain, such as terrain generalization and coupling between the controller and dynamics predictor, DHAL offers promising step toward learning-based control for hybrid systems in robotics."

Multi-Critic PPO Loss design Motivated by Zargarbashi et al. [34], we define P, G, and to represent the Pushing, Gliding, and Sim2Real tasks, respectively. Consequently, rP , rG, rS denote the weighted sums of the specific reward groups, while VP , VG, VS correspond to the respective value networks. The overall value loss is given by Lvalue = LP +LG +LS , where each term is defined as: LP = Et LG = Et LS = Et rP,t + γVP (st+1) VP (st)2(cid:105) (cid:104) rG,t + γVG(st+1) VG(st)2(cid:105) (cid:104) rS,t + γVS (st+1) VS (st)2(cid:105) (cid:104) (13) (14) (15) Here, γ is the discount factor, and st represents the state at time t. Each value loss minimizes the temporal difference (TD) error for the corresponding reward group. For advantage estimation in PPO, each reward group and its associated critic calculate the advantage separately based on the TD error. Taking Pushing as an example, the TD error is defined as: δP,t = rP,t + γ(1 dt)VP,t+1 VP,t (16) where dt is an indicator variable denoting whether the episode terminates at time t. The advantage is then calculated recursively as: AP,t = δP,t + γ(1 dt)λAP,t+1 (17) Here, λ is the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) parameter, which balances the trade-off between bias and variance in advantage estimation. After calculating the advantage for Pushing, it is normalized as follows: AP,t = AP,t µAP,t σAP,t + ϵ (18) where µAP,t and σAP,t are the mean and standard deviation of the advantage values for the Pushing task, and ϵ is small constant added for numerical stability. This process is repeated for both Gliding and Sim2Real, resulting in normalized advantages AG,t and AS,t. Finally, the weighted sum of all normalized advantages is computed as: At = AP,t + AG,t + AS,t (19)"

Finally, the overall PPO loss is computed as: LPPO = Lvalue + Lsurrogate H(πθ) (21) Here, H(πθ) represents the entropy of the policy πθ, encouraging exploration, and is weighting coefficient. This formulation integrates the value loss, the surrogate loss, and an entropy regularization term to achieve robust and efficient policy optimization.

Reward Detail The contact number reward for the gliding phase is expressed as: = 2 Rskateb Pground (22) where Rskateb represents the reward for maintaining correct contact with the skateboard, and Pground is the penalty for undesired ground contact. The skateboard contact reward is given by: Rskateb = δglide( 4 (cid:88) 1(cskateb,i)+41( 4 (cid:88) 1(cskateb,i) = 4)), i= i=1 (23) where δglide is scaling coefficient for the gliding phase, 1(cskateb,i) indicates whether the i-th foot is in contact with the skateboard, and an additional reward is provided if all four feet maintain contact. The ground contact penalty is expressed as: Pground = δglide( (cid:88) i{0,2} 1( cskateb,i)+ (cid:88) 1(cground,i)), i{0,2} (24) where 1( cskateb,i) penalizes the lack of skateboard contact for specific feet, and 1(cground,i) penalizes unintended ground contact. This reward design encourages the agent to maintain stable contact with the skateboard while avoiding unnecessary ground contact, ensuring smooth and efficient gliding behavior. The detailed reward weights is shown in Table. IV APPENDIX BETA DISTRIBUTION A. Why Gaussian distribution policy introduce bias Based on Chou et al. [35], when Gaussian policy πθ(a s) = (µθ, σ2 θ ) is employed in bounded action space [h, h](whatever because of environment manually design or physical constraints of robots), any action exceeding these limits is clipped to clip(a) [h, h]. Ideally, the policy gradient should be computed as θJ(πθ) = Eaπθ (cid:2)θ log πθ(a s) Aπ(s, a)(cid:3). However, if the update actually uses the clipped action in the value function, gclip = θ log πθ(clip(a) s) Aπ(cid:0)s, clip(a)(cid:1), then integrating over all reveals discrepancy whenever > h. Specifically, E[gclip] θJ(πθ) = (cid:34) Es (cid:82) a>h πθ(as)(θ log πθ(hs)Aπ(s, h) (cid:35) θ log πθ(as)Aπ(s, a)) da = 0. Because Gaussian often places nonnegligible probability mass outside h, this mismatch fails to cancel out, producing biased gradient that nudges the policy to favor actions beyond the valid range. The Policy Gradient of Gaussian distribution policy is shown below. σθ J(θ) = 1 σ3 θ Eaπθ (cid:2)(cid:0)(a µθ)2 σ2 θ (cid:1) Aπ(s, a)(cid:3) . Moreover, due to the bias in the policy, it may tend to produce actions outside the valid range. Increasing the variance becomes direct consequence of this tendency. This forms positive feedback loop: the more the policy variance grows, the more out-of-bound actions are sampled, and the larger (a µθ)2 becomes in the gradienteven though the actions are physically clipped. Unlike the Beta policy, Gaussian distribution can increase µ indefinitely. Thats the reason why Gaussian policy need more cautious reward design. B. Why Beta distribution do not introduce bias For Beta distribution, we first need to rescale it from [0, 1] to [h, +h]. Suppose Beta(αθ(s), βθ(s)), which is supported on [0, 1] and define = ϕ(z) = 2h(z 1 2 ). Thus [h, h]. Because ϕ is smooth, bijective function from [0, 1] [h, h], we can define the policys pdf as: πθ(a s) = Betaαθ(s),βθ(s) (cid:0)ϕ1(a)(cid:1) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) da (cid:12) (cid:12) ϕ1(a) (cid:12) (cid:12) . Concretely, ϕ1(a) = + 2h , (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) da (cid:12) (cid:12) ϕ1(a) (cid:12) (cid:12) = 1 2h . Hence, πθ(a s) = Betaαθ,βθ (cid:19) (cid:18) + 2h 1 2h , [h, h]. Let us verify the critical zero-integral property for the Beta policy: (cid:90) +h πθ(a s)θ log πθ(a s) da = (cid:90) +h θπθ(a s) da. But (cid:90) +h Thus, πθ(a s) da = 1 (all the mass is inside [h, h]). θ (cid:90) +h πθ(a s) da = θ[1] = 0. Hence, (cid:90) +h θπθ(a s) da = 0, i.e., (cid:90) +h πθ(a s)θ log πθ(a s) da = 0. No boundary terms appear, because πθ(a s) is zero outside [h, h].Thus, if plug πθ from above into the standard policy gradient formula (1), we could get an unbiased estimator: E(cid:2)θ log πθ(a s)Qπ(s, a)(cid:3) = θ (cid:90) +h πθ(a s)Qπ(s, a) da which equals to θJ(πθ). Beta(α, β) distribution on [0, 1] has well-known finite variance: Var(Z) = αβ (α + β)2(α + β + 1) . After rescaling the beta range for action [h, h], Var(A) = 4h2 Var(Z) 4h2 max ZBeta Var(Z). And we already know Var(Z) 1 12 (if α = β = 1, uniform). So: Var(A) h2 3 . The variance of rescaled Beta cannot exceed h3/3, for all α, β > 1 (we assume the control policy should be unimodal). C. Realization Detail We assume control policy for locomotion scenario is unimodal, therefore, α, β > 1. We define the activation function for output layer of actor as shown below: Sof tplusW ithOf set(x) = Sof tplus(x) + 1 + 1e During training, the action is sample from beta distribution and scale to [h, h]. For deployment, we directly use the mean of distribution α/(α + β) as the output. APPENDIX NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING HYPER-PARAMETER In Table. VI, we outline the hyperparameters for DHAL. Notably, the DHA is decoupled from both the encoder and the actor when ppo loss propagation and is only updated using the dynamics loss. During the PPO update, the PPO loss backpropagates through actor and encoder.

APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT SETTING AND SIM2REAL DETAIL A. Rolling Friction We observed that in Isaac Gym, the simulation of rolling objects, particularly wheels, is not highly accurate. This is primarily reflected in the discrepancies between simulated and real-world rolling friction, as well as imprecise collision detection. To address this, we applied compensation force during training to roughly approximate the effects of rolling friction on different terrains for the forward and backward motion of the skateboard. The compensation force is defined by the following formula: Fpush,x = Frand, Frand, 0, if vskate,x > 0.3 if vskate,x < 0.3 otherwise Frand (10, 25) vskate,x = quat rotate inverse (qskate, vskate) WhereFpush,x is the applied push force along the xaxis, Frand (10, 25) is the randomly sampled force, and vskate,x local frame, computed using the inverse quaternion rotation quat rotate inverse(qskate, vskate). skateboards velocity in its the is B. Skateboard Truck model To simulate realistic skateboard, we incorporated bridge structure into the robotic skateboard, consisting of front bridge and rear bridge. Each bridge is modeled using position-based PD controller to emulate spring dynamics, with the desired position and velocity set to zero at all times. C. Contact Detection in Isaac Gym, We found that the collision calculations for skateboard motion are imprecise. This is evident in the inaccuracies of the collision forces for passive rolling wheels as well as the collision forces between the robot and the skateboard. To address this, we designed the reward function to combine relative position error with collision forces to determine whether contact has occurred. This logic requires manual design and implementation. APPENDIX EXPERIMENTAL SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES A. Training Cost We train policy on an NVIDIA RTX 3090, each iteration takes 3 4 sec. Traning policy could deploy in real-world costs 6 7 hours in total. B. Single-Critic Reward In the experimental section, we compared the performance of single-critic and multi-critic approaches. To help readers clearly understand the differences between the two single-critic setups, we list their respective reward configurations in Table. VII. C. Extreme Terrain Experiments As shown in Fig. 11, we tested our robot in skatepark specifically designed for extreme skateboarding, featuring challenging multi-level stair sets, U-shaped bowls, and terrain with cliff-like characteristics. This environment allowed us to evaluate the limits of our algorithms performance. Surprisingly, our algorithm remained relatively stable across these complex terrains. Although the robot occasionally deviated from the skateboard due to terrain disturbances, it was still able to recover and maintain graceful skating posture. D. Hybrid Dynamics automata Validation in other task As shown in Fig. 12, We transferring our DHAL framework to robot handstand task. The flow dynamics and jump dynamics remain clearly identifiable(In handstand task, the mode is tightly coupled with hand contact).
