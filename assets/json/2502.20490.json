            "content": "Humans have long history of expecting AI to adhere to human-defined norms (Asimov, 1985; John, 2006; Chiang, 2010; Chambers, 2016). This is because norms are fundamental to human interactions and cooperation (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004; Chudek and Henrich, 2011), with even children being able to operate within norm-regulated environment (Schmidt et al., 2016; Köster and Hepach, 2024). Given the importance of norms to behavior moderation, and the popularity of model-driven embodied agents, we ask whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can understand norms grounded in the physical world and make normative decisions similar to those of humans? The answer to this question is critical if VLM-based agents are expected to collaborate and coordinate with humans (Chang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b), safely (Zhou et al., 2024a) and responsibly (He et al., 2024). Current VLMs are neither optimized for, nor evaluated on, physical-normative reasoning. While they excel at mathematical, scientific, and abstract reasoning (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Chollet et al., 2024), they are unlikely to have the same strong understanding of human normative dynamics in the physical world. This is because, unlike humans, who learn norms through active feedback in real-world and trial-and-error exploration (Zhou et al., 2024b), vision-language models obtain knowledge mainly by learning from web-crawled data (Li et al., 2024a), where physically-grounded normative reasoning is sparse (Ziems et al., 2023). To comprehensively measure VLM normative reasoning ability, we introduce EGONORMIA,1 challenging QA benchmark that is physically grounded in 1k egocentric social interaction clips from Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022). EGONORMIA spans 100 distinct settings across wide range of activities, cultures, and interactions. Unlike similarly visually-grounded spatiotemporal, predictive, or causal reasoning benchmarks (Chandrasegaran et al., 2024; Zellers et al., 2019), EGONORMIA evaluates models ability to reason about what should be done under social norms. EGONORMIA highlights cases where these normrelated objectives conflictthe richest arena for evaluating normative decision-making. As shown in Figure , every egocentric video clip in EGONORMIA is associated with set of five can1Ego-centric Norm in action didate actions that the agent could take next. Only one of these actions is marked by humans as the most appropriate, but the other actions may also be plausible, and each will reflect different combination of normative objectives (for more details, see 3.2). The candidate actions are associated with three related reasoning tasks: (1) classify the most appropriate action (2) classify the most fitting justification for that action, and (3) identify which of the candidate actions are contextually plausible. EGONORMIA allows us to thoroughly investigate three research questions: RQ1 Can VLMs make normative decisions that agree with human consensus? RQ2 If VLMs do not agree, is this due to failures in perception (e.g., object recognition) or gaps in normative reasoning? RQ3 Can we use EGONORMIA to improve the normative reasoning of VLMs? First, we find that VLMs that retain nearhuman performance on other reasoning datasets like EgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023) fall far behind human performance on EGONORMIA (45.3% vs 92.4%). Second, we determine that this failure is primarily due to gaps in normative reasoning (> 70% of errors), rather than perception (< 25% of errors). Third, we find that naive retrieval-based generation approach can improve performance by 10% on held-out EGONORMIA examples, and by nearly double on out-of-domain robotics videos, demonstrating the direct advantages of the application of EGONORMIA."

            "title": "2 Physical Social Norms (PSN)",
            "content": "Social norms are commonly-held expectations (Gibbs, 1965) that emerge and about behavior evolve spontaneously (Hechter and Opp, 2001; Chung and Rimal, 2016). Norms serve critical role in the coordination of multi-agent systems, and as the solutions to social dilemmas (Van Lange et al., 2013) like collective action problems (Ostrom, 2000). They enable agents to share similar expectations, become more predictable (Morsky and Akçay, 2019) and less prone to friction (Hollander and Wu, 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2007). AI agents need to understand and consistently follow norms, both to navigate social situations (Mavrogiannis et al., 2023), and effectively collaborate with humans. This is particularly true of embodied agents (Li et al., 2024b) like robots (Francis Figure 2: Examples of videos and corresponding norms under each taxonomy category in EGONORMIA. et al., 2024), which share physical environment with humans. In this case, the problem of normative reasoning is closely connected with physical reasoning; thus, we define the following: Physical social norms (PSNs) are shared expectations that govern how actors behave and interact with others in shared environments. To study physical social norms, we operationalize taxonomy of PSN categories, which stand for the social objectives that inform them. Figure 2 demonstrates examples of each. The last three categories explicitly serve the function of maximizing utility across multi-agent systems. We call these the Utility Norms: cooperation, coordination, and communication norms. The first four categories are more particular to human sociality: safety, politeness, privacy, and proxemics. Human sociality norms can often stand at odds with group utility norms, and this tension provides setting for evaluating agent decision-making under conflicting objectives. Importantly, each PSN category can still directly inform the success of human-agent collaboration as follows. Safety, principal concern for human-robot interaction (Lasota et al., 2017), describes not only the prevention of physical harms to humans and the environment, but also the mitigation of psychological harms like stress. safe social robot not only pauses its use of dangerous cutting tool when humans touch it; the robot should also refrain from using the tool in the presence of humans at all. Privacy involves respecting the personal possessions and private information of others. This is particularly relevant to agents operating in privacyconstrained environments and includes avoiding uncomfortable and prying questions and not intruding on private spaces (Altman, 1975; Lutz and Tamó-Larrieux, 2020; Shao et al., 2024). Proxemics proxemics is highly correlated with humans perceived safety around other agents (Huang et al., 2022), particularly with robots (Neggers et al., 2022), and denotes acceptable boundaries for personal space depending on cultural and situational expectations (Russell and Ward, 1982). Politeness relates to socially acceptable behaviors that shows respect. In physical contexts, this can involve gestures and body language that show consideration for others, or communication appropriate for ones social role (Mills and Kádár, 2011). Cooperation focuses on working collaboratively with others. It entails actions that facilitate mutual benefit and shared goals, like lifting heavy box with another person (Sunstein, 1996). Coordination/Proactivity involves anticipating and aligning actions with others to achieve successful interactions. Proactive behavior includes adjusting movements or actions in advance to prevent disruption (Paternotte and Grose, 2013). Communication/Legibility refers to the ability to clearly signal intentions and make ones physical behavior understandable to others, by using gestures, speech, or movement patterns to reduce ambiguity in social interactions (Francis et al., 2023). Figure 2 illustrates how physical social norms reference physical properties and social dynamics across each taxonomy category. By design, actions will satisfy some dimensions and may contravene otherscore to the complexity of human normative reasoning, and the primary motivation for introducing the taxonomy categories is the resolution of relative norm importance when they conflict."

Subtask 1: Action Selection. In this subtask, the model is provided with video frames of an activity and five candidate actions. Given these inputs, the model is asked to select the single most normatively appropriate action to perform in the context.2 We enforce strict plausibility constraints on possible answers to ensure that the correct action is not trivially identifiable by visually parsing objects in-scene or eliminating obviously non-normative options. Figure shows several example action options, each illustrating valid next step for the ego in the context of the video. To arrive at the correct choice C, proceeding to the dry ground, the model must consider multiple dimensions of normative behavior like safety, politeness, and cooperation. This subtask tests whether vision-language models can successfully make normative decisions in specific physical contexts. Subtask 2: Justification Selection. In this subtask, the model is provided with the same visual input as in Subtask 1 and is asked to select the best justification supporting its chosen normative action. For example, as shown in Figure , the model must select the appropriate justification for choosing ac2In the context of our benchmark, we use normative behavior and normative action interchangeably. tion (proceeding to the dry ground first)instead of directly offering help or simply moving away. This subtask enables the benchmark to qualify whether the model can identify the relevant context and articulate the correct underlying reasoning for its normative decision, serving as finer measure of normative reasoning. Subtask 3: Sensibility. To measure whether models understand the features that make action normative in context, we evaluate whether they can select the sensible (i.e. normative, but not necessarily best) options from the given actions."

            "content": "The benchmark generation pipeline is described in Figure 3. Appendix contains more detailed overview of the pipeline and methodology. The pipeline consists of the the following steps: Phase I: Snippet Sampling. We sourced video samples from Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022) as it matches the egocentric embodiment of human normative reasoning. To ensure diversity, we applied multi-step filtering process, sampling each unique scenario-verb combination to select video snippets across wide range of social and physical contexts. Phase II: Answer Generation. For each video sample, we generate four pairs of actions and justificationsone ground truth pair and three distractor pairs.3 To create challenging distractors, we systematically perturb the original context by altering key details that influence the interpretation of the action, leading to plausible alternatives that 3None is added after generation to create five total options. Figure 4: Example MCQs with choices by o3-mini (with text descriptions) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (with videos). Correct answers are underlined. In Video 1, o3-mini incorrectly concludes that the ego is \"moving frequently\" and wrongly selects \"holding the railing\" despite no railing being present. In Video 2, Gemini misinterprets the scene as \"leg press exercise\" and incorrectly opts to support \"lift\". In Video 3, o3-mini mistakenly categorizes this scenario as entertainment instead of housework, overlooking the fact that the women need assistance. require normative knowledge to disambiguate. Detailed prompts for answer generation can be found in Appendix A.2. Phase III: Filtering. The output of the second stage consists of high-quality but potentially noisy tasks; answers might be trivially resolvable, ambiguous, or nonsensical. Thus we perform normativity filtering by using chained LLMs to filter for answer feasibility and sensibility, then run blind filtering (i.e. no vision input) to remove questions answerable without context or through superficial reasoning, as these do not test embodied normative reasoning, leaving only challenging, contextdependent questions. Phase IV: Human Validation. Finally, two human validators are employed to verify the correct behavior and justification (manually adding them if not present or ambiguous), and to select the list of actions that are considered sensible. Two validators are used to ensure every datapoint receives independent agreement from two humans, ensuring that human agreement on EGONORMIA is replicable. The authors manually process datapoints where validators disagree on answers, ensuring that the benchmark remains challenging and achieves high human agreement. The detailed procedures for onboarding and training the human annotators, as well as the instructions for the curation process are provided in Appendix C."

            "content": "In evaluation on EGONORMIA, most models obtain mean accuracy lower than 40% on EGONORMIA, substantially exceeded by the average human score of 92.4%. Gemini 1.5 Pro, the best-performing model, evaluated under vision inputs, achieved mean accuracy of 45.3%, suggesting that current models have limited ability to make embodied normative decisions (RQ1). On the blind ablation, the accuracy of selecting both the correct behavior and justification drops by 22.1% and 24.1% for GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, respectively. This demonstrates that foundation models cannot rely on distribution biases or textual cues (Goyal et al., 2017) to solve EGONORMIA tasks.

Notably, (I) Reasoning models like o3-mini and Deepseek R1 see the most considerable performance improvement between the blind setting and the pipeline setting (+26.5% and +20.4% respectively), scoring comparably to the best-performing video setting models. We assume that normative reasoning scales strongly with general reasoning capability, while such inference-time scaling (Wu et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024) usually comes with long latency that prevents it from embodied use cases. (II) The best open-source models (Deepseek R1 and Qwen2.5 VL) are generally comparable to the best closed-source models, demonstrating that no model developers currently prioritize posttraining for norm understanding; however, this also implies strong and easily-exploitable opportunities for developing norm-reasoning VLMs. To investigate causes for the limited normative reasoning ability of VLMs (RQ2), we first examine performance variance across norm taxonFigure 5: Distribution of reasoning failure modes across GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and human evaluation.

The proportion of norm prioritization errors increases with overall performance on EGONORMIA. omy categories (App. Fig. 14) and activities (App. Fig. 15). Our findings indicate that models perform well in the safety and coordination/proactivity dimensions but struggle with communication/legibility. In terms of activity categories, models excel in art/culture-related tasks but perform poorly in shopping-related scenarios. Detailed additional analyses can be found in Appendix H. We find that normative reasoning failures are due primarily to misaligned normative knowledge, incorrect norm prioritization, and situational misinterpretation, rather than incorrect perception. We further categorize errors in normative reasoning by annotating the models full CoT responses on 100 representative tasks of EGONORMIA. Four failure modes were identified: (1) Norm sensibility errors, (2) Norm prioritization errors, (3) Perception errors, and (4) Answer refusal. The distribution of these model errors and human errors is shown in Figure 5. For models, the majority of failures were due to sensibility errors instead of perception, suggesting that foundation models are competent in processing the visual context of the video inputs but fail in performing sound normative reasoning on the parsed context. Furthermore, the ratio of norm prioritization errors grows as the overall performance increases (GPT-4o < Gemini 1.5 Pro < Human), suggesting more capable models struggle more with determining which norm should take precedence in ambiguous situations.

We demonstrate that, despite SOTA models strong visual recognition and abstract reasoning capabilities, they remain inferior to humans in PSN understanding, primarily due to norm sensibility and prioritization errors. We demonstrate EGONORMIAs direct utility in augmenting normative understanding by testing retrieval-based method, demonstrating improvements across out-of-domain and out-of-embodiment videos. Finally, we identify opportunities for future work in embodied norm understanding, suggesting post-training on large norm datasets as promising direction for study."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "While multiple rounds of filtering are applied to ensure diversity in EGONORMIA video clips, all video clips in EGONORMIA are exclusively from Ego4D, which may reflect inherent distribution biases within Ego4D. Expanding the benchmark to include broader range of video sources, including exocentric videos, would improve the generalization of the benchmark. Another limitation is that the current evaluation scheme treats videos as sequences of frames without incorporating audio information, which limits model performance on tasks that rely heavily on auditory cues. Integrating the audio modality in future work would provide more comprehensive assessment of the normative reasoning abilities of vision-language models. Finally, though the generation and filtering in generating highpipeline (3.2) is robust difficulty and high-quality EGONORMIA tasks, we find that Ego4D contains many action annotation errors that could lead to the generation of ambiguous or incorrect MCQs. We thus carefully conduct additional manual multi-stage filtering processes and human validation to remove or rectify low-quality samples from EGONORMIA to mitigate the impact of this issue."

            "title": "Ethics Statement",
            "content": "emphasize Ethical Assumptions. We that EGONORMIA is designed as descriptive benchmark rather than prescriptive one the dataset is intended to evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand physical social norms in egocentric videos, rather than to dictate what these norms should be or how they should be enforced. We thus acknowledge that the norms depicted in the dataset may not be universally applicable or appropriate in all contexts and that the interpretation of these norms may vary across cultures, communities, time periods, and individuals. Bias and Fairness. Despite our best efforts to create diverse and representative dataset, we acknowledge that EGONORMIA may contain biases that reflect the perspectives and experiences of the dataset creators and annotators. Consequently, the norms and justifications depicted in the dataset may be influenced by the cultural, social, and demographic characteristics of the individuals who contributed to the dataset. While all of our annotators are from the United States, norms often differ in different cultures (Rao et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). To address these concerns, we recommend that researchers using EGONORMIA for training or evaluation critically assess potential biases and ensure they align with the intended application context. Human Subjects and Privacy. EGONORMIA is constructed from Ego4D videos, which are publicly available and do not contain personally identifiable information. The Ego4D dataset is released under non-exclusive, non-transferable license that permits its use for academic research, as outlined in the license agreement. Our work complies with the terms of this license, using the Ego4D data solely for research purposes. Our annotation process was conducted with proper informed consent, ensuring annotators are fully aware of the task, its purpose, and how their contribution would be used. Annotators were compensated fairly for their time and effort (details in Appendix C). The data used in this work does not include personally identifiable information. No sensitive information about the annotators or individuals appearing in the video data was collected or used in the study. Notably, this work was thoroughly reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Stanford University (IRB-77185). Risks in Deployment. The deployment of AI systems trained on EGONORMIA may pose risks if these systems are used to make decisions that impact individuals safety, well-being, or rights. To mitigate these risks, we stress that EGONORMIA should not be used for prescriptive advice or to make decisions with ethical, or safety implications without extensive human oversight. By using EGONORMIA, researchers should be aware of the limitations of the dataset and the potential risks associated with deploying systems trained on it."

            "content": "You are teacher, teaching LLMs how to use the information in context description to choose from set of actions. Your job is to generate set of actions person [the subject] can take in given situation, with one being the most correct and socially normative action, and the others being incorrect or non-normative. However, it should be impossible to determine the correct action without the context. You are given base context {base}. Interpret the higher-level activity in the context generally, ignore specific tools or details of the context. Task instructions: Generate one action that is the most normative and correct action for the subject to perform in the base context. This is the Base Action, and should be the first action in the list. Next, change the base context to three new contexts. Each new context should assume additional details not stated in the base context, and use these to make the rules of the situation different. In each context, change the: Intention and situation (modify situation widely) Role of the subject and other people Interpret noun as co-hyponym Change the state of the overall activity (previous/future step) (Only in the last context) Make the role and intention of the subject the opposite of the base context (Sometimes) Interpret the cooperative intention (make the task two-person task, or make the other person do the action) (Sometimes) The culture or context of the action (Sometimes) add modifier to the object, environment, or subject (heaviness, disability, weather conditions, etc) From each new context, generate an alternative action for the subject to do next that is normative in the new context, but non-normative in the base context. This new action does not need to be the Target Intention, but can be another related action thats normative in the new context, but would be out of place in the base context. Ensure the generated actions are mechanically different from the target action, and that the correct action is only determinable with the context. The actions should not simply differ by the nouns or verbs used, but by the overall interpretation of the action. Avoid any answers that include prison, secret agents, kidnapping, or competitions. Action Guidelines: The actions should be strongly distinct from each other. Do not leak information about the context; actions should be written in general language. Most importantly: Avoid adverbs and words describing emotion or manner, and sentences should start in verb, not \"the subject.\" Avoid any actions that include ignore. The actions should be not be negative or harmful, nor refer to any violent activity, even if lawful. Actions must use imperative sentences describing the subjects interaction with person or object. Use the neutral term \"person\" when referring to other individuals, avoiding any descriptors of age, gender, or other characteristics. All actions should be of the same length and complexity, and should be of roughly equal length to the base action. Output the following JSON structure, without any additional content: { \"Contexts\": [\"Base Context\", \"Context 2\", \"Context 3\", \"Context 4\"], \"Actions\": [\"Base Action\", \"Action 2\", \"Action 3\", \"Action 4\"] } Below is an example of an output if the base context is \"Subject is pet owner, walking dog on sunny day next to road\". It interprets the general activity is \"walking pet\". Example: { \"Contexts\": [ \"Subject is pet owner, walking dog on sunny day next to road.\", \"Subject is dog trainer, dog is stray.\", \"Subject is person, dog is pocket dog, navigating muddy field and want to avoid getting dog dirty.\", \"Subject is blind person, dog is guide dog, and they are navigating crowded city street.\" ], \"Actions\": [ \"Guide the dog along sidewalk using leash.\", \"Call the dog to follow you, using treat, and guide it to shelter.\", \"Carry the dog across the muddy field, shielding it from dirt.\", \"Let the dog guide you with its harness.\" ] }"

Phase I: Video Sampling EGONORMIA sources its videos from the Ego4D dataset (Grauman et al., 2022), consisting of 3650 hours of richly annotated egocentric footage of commonplace human activities in context. We selected the Ego4D dataset as our video source for the following reasons: (1) Its egocentric perspective aligns with human embodiment and the embodied systems this benchmark aims to support. (2) It includes over 3.85 million action-centric visual narrations, facilitating the (3) Its diverse identification of unique actions. range of situations and actions enables EgoNormia to comprehensively explore the space of physicalsocial norms. We created diverse dataset by selecting narrations that involved multiple actors, analyzing the verbs and scenarios present, and sampling up to three instances from each unique combination while excluding game-related scenarios to focus on natural social and physical interactions. This curation yielded 4446 unique samples, sourced from from unique 1870 videos. Phase II: Answer Generation For each example, the goal is to produce four candidate answers, comprising one gold-standard response (i.e. best matching human expectations) and three distractors (not counting None, which is added after generation). To generate high-quality alternative actions and justifications, we employ structured, multi-shot pipeline with GPT-4o-based Chain-ofThought prompting (Wei et al., 2022). Frames of sampled snippets of Phase are first processed with VLM to extract scene context description c, consisting of the activity, the identities of the people involved, and the environment. The context are then corrupted via LLM to programmatically modify the core context, to change the norms that are relevant in the context. Here, we leverage the defeasibility and compositionality of norms explored by NormBank (Ziems et al., 2023) to add, remove, or modify elements of the context, yielding three additional contexts, which form the context set. Then an LLM generates noisy set of actions A+ and their justifications + for each context in the context set, where the LLM is directed to generate the best action to perform in that given context, justification for why that norm is most important, and also the categories to which each action belongs to. These are generated in multiturn way, where each inference uses the result of Phase III: Filtering The output of Phase II consists of high-quality but noisy sets (A+,J +), as the wide scale of the action generation may yield trivially resolvable tasks, or those whose best action is ambiguous, even with context. Thus, we refine A+ and + with several filtering rounds to ensure the correctness, context-dependence, and high difficulty of questions, to yield filtered and for each example: (i) Normativity filtering: We remove certain action descriptions can describe an action thats not feasibility or is harmful in any situation. (ii) Blind filtering. To enforce EgoNormia tasks requring grounded visual reasoning to solve, \"blind\" baseline is compiled: Any task whose gold standard answer is obviously correct without context, either due to nonsensical answers or leaky domain knowledge, is filtered out as they do not test visual normative reasoning. Phase IV: Human Validation To ensure the clarity and alignment of answers with human normative reasoning, we employ manual validation process: (i) In the first round, annotators are engaged through Prolific to inspect every sample manually (The detailed procedures for onboarding and training the human annotators, as well as the instructions for the curation process are provided in the in Appendix C). Annotators are responsible for three key tasks: for each example, verifying that the best action and justification are present in and without overlapping in meaning with any other alternatives; selecting other given actions and justifications that are appropriate in the given situation but do not represent the most normative choice; and confirming whether the best action is followed in the video afterwards. (ii) Two annotators must agree on the best action for given and to be accepted; they are allowed to provide their own preferred and if no answer is correct. In cases of new annoated actions, and are manually reconciled by the authors and either modified or rejected outright. This reduces the number of admissible samples by 50%. (iii) Finally, second expert curation round is performed, to manually validate the difficulty and diversity of each sample. Only 85% of the examples that pass the first round also pass the second round, demonstrating the relative difficulty of generating nontrivial grounded norm-resolution situations."

The annotators are first screened (i.e. qualification task) to ensure that they can provide high-quality annotations and then are invited to the main annotation task. C.1 Screening Process To ensure the quality of the annotations, we set up screening process to select high-quality annotators. The screening process aims to ensure that the annotators: 1. Follow the instructions carefully, 2. Understand the terminology used in the dataset, 3. Can identify best actions and justifications, and 4. Can write normative actions and justifications that fall within the context of the scene. We provide detailed instructions and examples to help the annotators understand the task. Figure 9 shows the interface of the screening process. We pay the annotators $1.0 for screening. Out of 350 annotators who participated in the screening process, 33% passed the screening process and were invited to the main annotation task. C.2 Main Annotation Task In the main annotation task, the annotators are required to watch video clip. When the video clip ends, the annotators are presented with set of AJTs and are asked to select the best AJT. If they believe the best AJT is not present in the set, they can write their own AJT. The annotators are also asked to mark the AJTs as sensible or non-sensible. To prevent any biases in the annotations, the annotators cant change their selection of best AJT after watching the next scene. Figures 10 and 11 show the interface of the main annotation task. The annotators were paid $0.40 for each completed annotation which translates to an hourly wage of $18.95 (median time to complete an annotation was 1:16 minutes). In total, we collected 3095 annotations from 90 annotators. The annotators were all based in the United States from diverse backgrounds. Figure 7 shows the demographics of the annotators. Each annotator was allowed to 6https://www.prolific.co/ Figure 7: Demographics of the annotators. More than half (58%) of the annotators are White. Figure 8: Number of tasks completed by annotators. Most annotators completed fewer than 25 tasks. complete up to 200 annotations. On average, each annotator completed 34 tasks. Figure 8 shows the number of tasks completed by annotators. The annotations were randomly reviewed by the authors to ensure the quality of the annotations."

In-domain evaluations were conducted exclusively on the unseen (i.e. not processed/embedded) task split. The processing step involves parsing the text context with VLM (Gemini 1.5 Flash), which is subsequently converted into text embedding that is indexed into the downstream embedding database. When video is queried, the context of the query video is parsed and converted to an embedding following the same method as above. This embedding is then used to retrieve the five closest contexts by cosine similarity. By indexing over wide range of contexts in EGONORMIA, we demonstrate the utility of the datasets diversity, and minimize the effect of poorly-matched retrievals. We do not rigorously protect against poorly-matched retrievals, as NormThinker is designed primarily as showcase of EgoNormias direct utility for augmenting VLM norm understanding, and also as demonstration of the relative ease of improving normative reasoning performance on current SOTA models, in order to motivate future work and exploration in this domain. Finally, the five corresponding groundtruth actions for these contexts are appended to the base models prompt, and the rest of the pipeline proceeds as it does without retrieval."
