AD is developed to primarily\nassist Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) audiences in understanding\nmovie storylines [36]. Due to the prohibitive cost of employing\nskilled annotators for AD creation, the amount of AD-equipped\nvideos remains limited, highlighting the need for automatic AD\ngeneration systems. Recent advancements in multi-modal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) for video understanding [15, 57] have\nmade automatic movie audio description generation feasible.",

Therefore, AD narratives must be concise Both authors contributed equally to this research. Corresponding author. Figure 1: FocusedAD: We propose an automated charactercentric AD generation model that emphasizes main character regions appearances and actions while incorporating narrative context. Characters appearing in the movie clip are annotated with colored bounding boxes. to prevent information overload. Due to the length constraints, AD needs to compress complex visual information into limited textual descriptions while preserving narrative crucial elements [39] such as characters description [23] and scene transitions [1]. Particularly in character-centric scenes, the appearance, actions, and expressions of individual characters, along with inter-character interactions and relationships, carry greater narrative significance than static scene arrangements and plot-irrelevant objects [51]. However, existing works [17, 18, 54] typically employ image encoders to extract key frame features followed by LLM for generating dense video captions, resulting in relatively smooth attention distribution across scene-level features [52]. This methodology struggles to achieve an optimal balance between descriptive detail and narrative coherence, often producing redundant object-centric (e.g., \"red chair, blue table\") rather than event-driven storytelling (e.g., \"the character anxiously surveys the room\"). Thus, it is essential for automated AD generation models to possess the ability to focus on narrative-salient regions, feature that current methods inadequately address. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the comprehension of the story for audiences, particularly individuals in the BVI, AD requires explicit character identification by name (e.g. \"Harry walks in\") [17]. This poses more stringent requirements on content description compared to conventional video captioning [42], which employs ambiguous expressions such as \"he/she\" or \"a man/woman\". Following MM 25, October 2731, 2025, Dublin, Ireland Xiaojun Ye, Chun Wang et al. character region detection, concurrent with description generation, the model ought to establish precise mappings between detected regions and character identities, thereby enabling effective character name references in the generated AD [54]. This demands enhanced capabilities in character tracking and identification across different frames, particularly challenging in multi-character scenarios. However, certain models [18, 54] rely on subtitles to extract character names, where the frequency of character name occurrences is substantially lower than AD requirements. Other models [17, 50] incorporate additional character recognition modules with inadequate performance due to feature shifts caused by variations in characters appearances and makeup. These approaches struggle to effectively identify characters associated with ongoing actions, resulting in semantic ambiguity and reduced narrative coherence. In this paper, we present FocusedAD, novel model that recognize effective main character and generate ad which focus on narratively relevant elements, as illustrated in fig. 1. To enable the generated AD to focus on narrative-salient regions, we first introduce Character Perception Module (CPM) to identify main characters in arbitrary frames of current movie clips. The module employs bi-directional propagation to obtain character-specific region lists throughout the movie clips. The detected character regions are subsequently fed into two distinct modules. In order to address the challenges of active character recognition, we introduce an automated clustering-based pipeline for optimal character bank query generation, applicable to both our training and testing sets. With the character best query bank, we effectively identify main characters by computing distances between detected faces and each characters best query, incorporating this information as visual priors into the Dynamic Prior Module (DPM), which dynamically adapts to scenes with varying numbers of characters. Finally, we introduce the Focused Caption Module (FCM), performing joint reasoning over scene visual tokens TùëÜ , character tokens Tùê∂ , and text tokens Tùëä to generate character-centric ADs, which is then evaluated against ground-truth ADs. Our approach addresses critical limitation of current MLLMs that tend to generate redundant content when processing video captioning tasks, resulting in movie ADs that more effectively facilitate story comprehension for BVI audiences. Our primary contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose FocusedAD, model that leverages both temporal context and character information to generate storycoherent and character-centric AD. Through the soft prompt mechanism, our model dynamically adapts to scenes containing varying numbers of characters. We develop an automated data construction pipeline for creating an optimal character query bank, effectively addressing the limitation of insufficient character information in both training and testing AD datasets. We show promising results on character-centric AD, as seen from both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and also achieve impressive zero-shot state-of-the-art performance on both the MAD-eval-Named benchmark and our newly introduced Cinepile-AD test set."

Thus, character recognition serves as prerequisite for the task, with numerous works proposing automatic identification pipelines based on face recognition [11] or ReID [25, 47]. Current models are exploring methods to incorporate character names in generated text, either through Named Entity Recognition (NER) from subtitles [18] or face recognition based on actor portraits [17]. Departing from previous approaches, we propose method based on automated clustering to obtain character best query bank for more robust character identity features generation, effectively addressing the variations in character visual features caused by changes in lighting conditions and scene contexts.

Character Query Clustering. Actors portrait images can differ considerably in appearance from the character in the movie due to various factors, such as hairstyle, makeup, dress, ageing, or camera viewpoint [35]. To improve the accuracy of character recognition, we propose calibration mechanism to get the best character query.

Given sequence of key frames = {I1, I2, ..., Iùêæ } for the movie clip ùë•ùëñ , we perform main character recognition by iterating through each key frame. Specially, we process the video frame by frame using MTCNN [55] as our face detector to locate facial regions in each frame. For frame ùëò , assuming ùê∂ faces are detected, we obtain set of cropped face images {ùë•ùëò ùê¥}.

Our Temporal Character Region Propagation Module allows the character regions on any frame of the movie clip as input. After receiving initial region, the module propagates these regions to obtain the masklet of the character across the entire movie clip, localizing the segmentation mask of the target on every key frame. Specially, we firstly share the visual features extracted from an MAE [19] pre-trained Hiera [40] image encoder across all objects and global features within the movie clip. Then, we utilize the memory encoder [37] to generate memory by downsampling the output mask using convolutional module and summing it element-wise with the unconditioned frame embedding from the image encoder, followed by light-weight convolutional layers to fuse the information. Meanwhile, we maintain memory bank that keeps track of past predictions for the target character in the movie clip by maintaining FIFO queue of memories from up to ùêæ context frames, and stores prompt information in FIFO queue of up to the frames which recognizes main characters. The memory attention operation takes the per-frame embedding from the image encoder and conditions it on the memory bank, before the mask decoder ingests it to form prediction. Finally, we employ memory attention to condition the current frame features on both historical frame features and Figure 3: Character Perception Module traverses the key frame sequence, detecting main characters in any frame and obtaining their segmented regions. Videos are processed in streaming fashion, where each frame cross-attends to the main character memories from context frames.

K-means clustering to generate the best query list for characters significantly enhances the accuracy of character recognition and consequently improves the quality of movie audio descriptions (C2 vs B2). This comparison also shows the necessity and effectiveness of our Character Perception Module. In fig. 7, we demonstrate the impact of varying thresholds in Character Recognition on character identification accuracy. We use the model C2 in table 1, and evaluated five candidate thresholds with increments of 0.1. Our experiments reveal that the model achieves optimal character recognition accuracy at threshold value of ùë¢ = 1.3. This optimal threshold likely reflects the common occurrence of profile faces in movies.

            "content": "Effect of Character Perception Module. By default, the model takes the predicted active characters in the scene from the Character Perception Module. From the comparison of rows B1, B2 and C2, we can draw the following observations: (i) injecting character names gives clear performance gain (C2 vs B1), highlighting the dependency of the AD task on character names; (ii) employing Figure 7: Ablation study on the film Les Mis√©rables to evaluate changes in FocusedAD indicators under varying thresholds. This film is selected for its representative nature, as its metrics closely align with the average of MAD-eval-Named. Effect of Dynamic Prior Module. In the Dynamic Prior Module, we incorporate previous ADs and subtitles as context for the model (C1 vs C2), while introducing soft prompt mechanism that embeds both text and visual priors into the dynamic instruction template (A1 vs A2). The results show that AD generation can be further improved by combining these methods, demonstrating that our Dynamic Prior Module helps the model integrate previous contextual priors to flexibly focus on the content that needs to be described in the current segment when generating ADs. MM 25, October 2731, 2025, Dublin, Ireland Xiaojun Ye, Chun Wang et al. Figure 8: Qualitative results of our method. The top two movie clips demos are from MAD-eval-Named and the bottom two movie clips demos are from Cinepile-AD. The Character Perception Module can recognize active main characters and feed their names into the AD generation pipeline. For visualization purposes, we display the portrait images of characters that have the closest distance to the best query, but the model actually utilizes the best query features as input. Effect of Focused Caption Module. table 1 demonstrates the benefits of incorporating the Focused Caption Module (A2 vs C2). Our results indicate that generating rich character-level tokens through the object encoder and integrating them with scene-level visual representations and language embeddings effectively guides the model to allocate more attention to main character regions. This mechanism enables the model to focus predominantly on describing main characters appearances and actions, facilitating the generation of ADs that better focus on narrative-relevant regions.

We next compare our model with state-of-the-art general video understanding MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL [6] and VideoLLaMA3 [9]. Despite their supervised fine-tuning on extensive videorelevant fine-grained datasets, these models primarily focus on scene-level features. In contrast, our FocusedAD emphasizes charactercentric details, generating predictions that better align with movie audio description preferences."
