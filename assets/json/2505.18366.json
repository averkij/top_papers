            "content": "Accurate retrieval of domain-specific information significantly impacts critical enterprise processes, such as knowledge management, customer support, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Agents. However, achieving precise retrieval remains challenging due to semantic mismatches, overlapping terminologies, and ambiguous abbreviations common in specialized fields like finance, and cloud computing. Traditional lexical retrieval techniques, such as BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1994), struggle due to vocabulary mismatches, leading to irrelevant results and poor user experience. Recent dense retrieval approaches leveraging pre-trained language models, like BERT-based encoders (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020), mitigate lexical limitations by capturing semantic relevance. Nevertheless, their performance heavily relies on the negative samplesdocuments incorrectly retrieved due to semantic similarity but lacking contextual relevance. Models trained with negative sampling methods (e.g., random sampling, BM25-based static sampling, or dynamic methods like ANCE (Xiong et al., 2020), STAR (Zhan et al., 2021)) either lack sufficient semantic discrimination or incur high computational costs, thus limiting scalability and practical enterprise deployment. For instance, given query such as \"Steps to deploy MySQL database on Cloud Infrastructure,\" most negative sampling techniques select documents discussing non-MySQL database deployments. Conversely, our method strategically selects hard negative discussing MySQL deployment on-premises, which despite semantic overlap, is contextually distinct and thus poses stronger training challenge for the retrieval and re-ranking models. Our proposed framework addresses these by introducing novel semantic selection criterion explicitly designed to curate high-quality hard negatives. By uniquely formulating two semantic conditions that effectively select negatives that closely resemble query semantics but remain contextually irrelevant, significantly minimizing false negatives encountered by existing techniques. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. negative mining framework for dynamically selecting semantically challenging hard negatives, leveraging diverse embedding models and semantic filtering criteria to significantly improve re-ranking models in domain-specific retrieval scenarios. * The authors contributed equally to this work. 2.

            "title": "2.1 Hard Negatives in Retrieval Models",
            "content": "The role of hard negatives in training dense retrieval models has been widely studied. Static negatives, such as BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1994), provide lexical similarity but fail to capture semantic relevance, often leading to overfitting (Qu et al., 2020). Dynamic negatives, introduced in ANCE (Xiong et al., 2020) and STAR (Zhan et al., 2021), adapt during training to provide more challenging contrasts but require significant computational resources due to periodic re-indexing. Our framework addresses these limitations by dynamically identifying semantically challenging negatives using clustering and dimensionality reduction, ensuring scalability and adaptability. Further studies have explored advanced methods for negative sampling in cross-encoder models (Meghwani, 2024). Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) (Guo et al., 2023) integrates hard negatives into cross-encoder training, improving the reranking performance when negatives align with the output of the retriever. Similarly, (Pradeep et al., 2022) demonstrated the importance of hard negatives even when models undergo advanced pretraining techniques, such as condenser (Gao and Callan, 2021). Our work builds on these efforts by offering scalable approach, which can be applied to any domain-heavy enterprise data. Random Negatives: Efficient but lacking semantic contrast, leading to suboptimal performance (Karpukhin et al., 2020). BM25 Negatives: Leverage lexical similarity, but often introduce biases, particularly in semantically rich domains (Robertson and Walker, 1994). In-Batch Negatives: Computationally efficient but limited to local semantic contrasts, often underperforming in dense retrieval tasks (Xiong et al., 2020). Our framework complements these approaches by dynamically generating negatives that balance semantic similarity and contextual irrelevance, avoiding the pitfalls of static or random methods."

Our approach addresses these gaps by curating hard negatives that align with enterprise-specific semantics, improving retrieval precision and robustness for proprietary datasets.

            "content": "To effectively train and finetune reranker models for domain-specific retrieval, it is essential to systematically handle technical ambiguities stemming from specialized terminologies, overlapping concepts, and abbreviations prevalent within enterprise domains. We propose structured, modular framework that integrates diverse embedding models, dimensionality reduction, and novel semantic criterion for hard-negative selection. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level pipeline, components and their interactions. The re-ranking models fine-tuned using the Accepted in ACL 2025 Figure 1: Overview of the methodology pipeline for training reranker models, including embedding generation, PCA-based dimensionality reduction and hard negative selection for fine-tuning. hard negatives generated by our framework are directly deployed in downstream applications, such as RAG, significantly improving the resolution of customer queries through enhanced retrieval. Our approach begins by encoding queries and documents into semantically rich vector representations using an ensemble of state-of-the-art biencoder embedding models. These embeddings are strategically selected based on multilingual support, embedding quality, training data diversity, context length handling, and performance (details provided in Appendix A.2. To manage embedding dimensionality and improve computational efficiency, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Mackiewicz and Ratajczak, 1993) is utilized to project the concatenated embeddings onto lowerdimensional space, maintaining 95% of the original variance. We then define two semantic conditions (Eq. 5 and Eq. 6) to dynamically select high-quality hard negatives, addressing semantic similarity challenges and minimizing false negatives. Together, these two equations ensure that the selected hard negative is not only close to the query (Eq. 5) but also contextually distinct from the true positive, minimizing the risk of selecting topic duplicates or noisy positives (Eq. 6). For example, query about deploying MySQL on Oracle Cloud, PD is guide on that topic, and is doc about MySQL on-premise semantically close to Q, but distant from PD. Below we detail each methodological component, emphasizing their contributions to enhancing retrieval precision in domain-specific or enterprise retrieval tasks.

To further validate generalizability, we conduct evaluations on publicly available domain-specific benchmarks: FiQA (finance) (TheFinAI, 2018), Climate Fever (climate science) (Diggelmann et al., 2021), and TechQA (technology) (Castelli et al., 2019).

We specifically select PCA due to its computational efficiency, and scalability, essential given our large enterprise corpus and high-dimensional embedding space. While we empirically evaluated nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP (McInnes et al., 2020) and t-SNE (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008), they offered negligible performance improvements over PCA but incurred substantially higher computational costs, making them impractical for deployment at scale in enterprise systems."

Equation (6), ensures that the selected hard negative is not just query-confusing but also sufficiently dissimilar from the actual positive (avoiding near-duplicates or false negatives). The candidate document DHN with minimal d(Q, D) satisfying these conditions is chosen as the primary hard negative. Additional hard negatives can similarly be selected based on semantic proximity rankings.

Our method achieves notable relative improvements of 15% in MRR@3 and 19% in MRR@10 over this baseline. The semantic nature of our hard negatives allows the reranker to distinguish contextually irrelevant but semantically similar documents effectively. In contrast, simpler baselines like Random or BM25 negatives suffer due to no semantic consideration, while advanced methods like STAR and ADORE+STAR occasionally miss subtle semantic nuances that our formulated selection criteria address effectively. Generalization Across Open-source Models To validate the robustness and versatility of our framework, we evaluated various open-source embedding and reranker models  (Table 4)  , clearly demonstrating improvements across all models when finetuned using our proposed negative sampling compared to ADORE+STAR and baseline (no finetuning). Notably, rerankers with multilingual capabilities, such as the BGE-Reranker and Jina Reranker, demonstrated pronounced improvements, likely benefiting from our embedding ensembles multilingual semantic richness. Similarly, larger models like e5-mistral exhibit significant gains, reflecting their capacity to exploit nuanced semantic differences provided by our negative samples.

Performance Analysis on Short vs. Long Documents An explicit analysis of short versus long documents  (Table 5)  revealed differential performance gains. Short documents (under 1024 tokens) experienced substantial performance improvements (MRR@3 improving from 0.481 to 0.61), attributed to minimal semantic redundancy and tokenization constraints. Conversely, long documents showed more moderate improvements (MRR@3 from 0.423 to 0.475), primarily due to embedding truncation that causes loss of context and increased semantic complexity. Future research should focus explicitly on developing hierarchical or segment-based embedding methods to address these limitations. Ablation Studies To clearly understand the impact of the individual components of the framework, we conducted systematic ablation studies  (Table 6)  . Training with positive documents alone produced only slight gains (+0.03 MRR@3), reaffirming the critical role of high-quality hard negatives. Evaluating individual embedding models separately indicated varying performance due to their differing semantic representations and underlying training. However, the concatenation of diverse embeddings provided significant performance improvements (+0.15 MRR@3), clearly highlighting the advantages of capturing semantic diversity. Additionally, PCA-based dimensionality reduction analysis identified the optimal variance threshold at 95%. Lower thresholds resulted in marked semantic degradation, reducing retrieval performance. This trade-off highlights PCA as an essential efficiency-enhancing step for the framework. Collectively, these detailed analyses underscore our methods strengths, limitations, and methodological rationale, providing clear empirical justification for each design decision.

Additionally, the retrieval of long documents is complicated by semantic redundancy and truncation, warranting deeper analysis of their structural complexity. Our current use of embedding concatenation for ensembling could also be refinedfuture work should evaluate alternative fusion techniques such as weighted averaging or attention-based mechanisms. Moreover, extending the retrieval framework to support cross-lingual and multilingual scenarios would enhance its utility in globally distributed applications.

A.1 Extended Related Work Hard Negatives in Retrieval Models Static and dynamic hard negatives have been extensively studied. Static negatives, such as those generated by BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1994) or PassageBM25 (Nguyen et al., 2022), provide challenging lexical contrasts but risk overfitting due to their fixed nature (Qu et al., 2020). Dynamic negatives, as introduced in ANCE (Xiong et al., 2020) and ADORE (Zhan et al., 2021) adapt during training, other effective methods like positive-aware mining (de Souza P. Moreira et al., 2024), theme-enhanced negatives (Li et al., 2024) offers relevant challenges but incurring high computational costs due to periodic re-indexing and bigger embedding dimension. Our framework mitigates these issues by leveraging clustering and dimensionality reduction to dynamically identify negatives without requiring re-indexing. Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) (Guo et al., 2023; AGARWAL, 2021) further demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating hard negatives into cross-encoder training, improving reranking accuracy when negatives align with retriever outputs. Additionally, (Pradeep et al., 2022) highlighted the importance of hard negatives even in advanced pretraining setups like Condenser (Gao and Callan, 2021), which emphasizes their necessity for robust optimization. in Dense Retrieval and CrossAdvances Encoders Dense like retrieval models DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and REALM (Guu et al., 2020) encode queries and documents into dense embeddings, enabling semantic matching. Recent advances in dense retrieval and ranking include GripRanks generative knowledge-driven passage ranking (Bai et al., 2023), Dense Hierarchical Retrievals multi-stage framework for efficient question answering (Liu et al., 2021; Pattnayak et al., 2025a,c,b; Patel et al., 2025), and TriSamplers optimized negative sampling for (Yang et al., 2024), collectively dense retrieval enhancing retrieval performance.Cross-encoders, such as monoBERT (Nogueira et al., 2019; Nogueira and Cho, 2019), further improve retrieval precision by jointly encoding query-document pairs but require high-quality training data, particularly challenging negatives (MacAvaney et al., 2019; Panda et al., 2025b). Techniques such Accepted in ACL 2025 as synthetic data generation (Askari et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2024a, 2025) augment training datasets but lack the realism and semantic depth provided by our hard negative mining approach. Dimensionality Reduction in IR Clustering methods have been used to group semantically similar documents, improving retrieval efficiency and training data organization (Mehta et al., 2024; Jasila et al., 2023; Dua et al., 2025; Panda et al., 2025a). Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Wold et al., 1987) enhance scalability by reducing computational complexity. Our framework uniquely combines these techniques to dynamically identify negatives that challenge retrieval models in scalable manner. Data Synthetic Retrieval Recent in work (Askari et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2024a,b; Patel et al., 2024; Dua et al., 2024; Pabolu et al., 2024a,b) has explored using large language models to generate synthetic training data for retrieval tasks. While effective in low-resource settings, synthetic data often struggles with factual inaccuracies and domain-specific relevance. In contrast, our framework relies on real-world data to curate semantically challenging negatives, ensuring high-quality training samples without introducing synthetic biases. Summary of Contributions While previous works address various aspects of negative sampling, hard negatives, and synthetic data, our approach bridges the gap between static and dynamic strategies. By dynamically curating negatives using clustering and dimensionality reduction, we achieve scalable and semantically precise methodology tailored to domain-specific retrieval tasks. A.2 Extended Methodology A.2.1 Dataset Statistics Queries Length Distribution In this section we analyze the distribution of queries length in our enterprise dataset. Figure 4 shows that the length of queries ranges from 1 to 25 words, with some queries having very few words. This highlights that user queries can sometime be just 2-3 words about topic, increasing the probability of retrieving documents mentioning those topics or concepts which can be contextually different. Therefore, when we select hard negatives, it is crucial to consider not only the relationship between the query and documents but also the relationship between the Figure 4: Length Distribution of queries in the dataset. positive document and other documents, ensuring comparison with texts on similar topics and similar lengths. Model (Ek) Params (M) Dimension Max Tokens stella_en_400M_v5 jina-embeddings-v3 (multilingual) mxbai-embed-large-v1 bge-large-en-v1.5 LaBSE (multilingual) all-mpnet-base-v2 (multilingual) 435 572 335 335 471 110 8192 1024 1024 1024 768 8192 8194 512 512 256 514 Table 7: Embedding models used to construct Xconcat, combining diverse semantic representations for queries (Q), positive documents (P D), and corpus documents (D). Figure 5: Shows document length distribution in Enterprise corpus. Accepted in ACL 2025 Document Length Distribution As shown in Figure 5 , document lengths are significantly longer than query lengths. This disparity in context length affects the similarity scores, potentially reducing the accuracy of retrieval systems. In our in-house dataset, each query is paired with single correct document (though its not limited by number of positive-negative document per query). This positive document is crucial for identifying challenging hard negatives and hence helpful for encoder-based model training. A.2.2 Embedding Models Table 7 lists the embedding models (Zhang, 2024; Sturua et al., 2024; Li and Li, 2023; Xiao et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2022; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Zhang et al., 2024) used to construct Xconcat, combining diverse semantic representations for queries (Q), positive documents (P D), and corpus documents (D). These models were selected for their performance, model size, ability to handle multilingual context, providing complementary strengths in dimensionality and token coverage. By integrating embeddings from these models, the framework captures nuanced semantic relationships crucial for reranker training. A.2.3 Unified Contrastive Loss The unified contrastive loss is designed to improve ranking precision for both bi-encoders and crossencoders, by ensuring that positive documents (P D) are ranked closer to the query (Q) than hard negatives (DHN ) by margin m. The loss is defined as: = (cid:88) i=1 max (0, + d(Qi, Di) d(Qi, DHNi)) (7) where: For bi-encoders, the distance metric is defined as: d(Qi, Di) = 1 cosine(eQi, eDi), (8) where eQi and eDi are the embeddings of the query and document, respectively. For cross-encoders, the distance metric is: d(Qi, Di) = s(Qi, Di), (9) where s(Qi, Di) is the cross-encoders relevance score for the query-document pair. This formulation leverages the triplet of (Q, D, DHN ) to minimize d(Qi, Di), pulling positive documents closer to the query, while maximizing d(Qi, DHNi), pushing hard negatives further away. By emphasizing semantically challenging examples, the model learns sharper decision boundaries for improved ranking precision. A.3 Experimental Setup Datasets We evaluate our framework extensively using both proprietary and public datasets: Internal Proprietary Dataset: Consisting of approximately 5250 query-document pairs, on cloud services like computing, networking, firewall, ai services. It includes both short (< [1024 tokens]) and long documents (>= [1024 tokens]). FiQA Dataset: financial domain-specific dataset widely used for retrieval benchmarking. Climate-FEVER Dataset: An environmentspecific fact-checking dataset focused on climate-related information retrieval. TechQA Dataset: technical questionanswering dataset emphasizing software engineering and technology-related queries. Di: Positive document associated with query Qi. DHNi: Hard negative document, semantically similar to Di but contextually irrelevant. d(Qi, Di): Distance metric measuring relevance between Qi and Di. m: Margin ensuring Di is closer to Qi than DHNi by at least m, encouraging the model to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant documents effectively. Training and Fine-tuning All re-ranking models are fine-tuned using triplet loss with margin with same hyper-parameters. Early stopping is employed based on validation MRR@10 scores to prevent overfitting. Evaluation Metrics Model performance is evaluated using standard retrieval metrics: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) at positions 3 and 10 (MRR@3 and MRR@10), which measure retrieval quality and ranking precision. Each reported metric is averaged across three experimental runs for robustness. Accepted in ACL 2025 Strategy Baseline Finetuned with Hard Negatives (Ours) Training Data MRR@3 MRR@10 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0.42 0.46 0.48 0.50 0.52 0.52 0.54 0.54 0.56 0.57 0.57 0.45 0.49 0.51 0.53 0.56 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.63 0.64 0. Table 8: Comparison of Strategies with Varying Training Data Sizes A.4 Extended Results & Ablation Impact of Training Data Size As shown in Table 8, both MRR@3 and MRR@10 improve as the training data size increases, with more pronounced gains in MRR@10. MRR@3 shows gradual improvement, from 0.42 at the baseline to 0.57 with 100 examples, highlighting the models enhanced ability to rank relevant documents within the top 3. MRR@10, on the other hand, shows more significant improvement, from 0.45 to 0.64, indicating that the model benefits more from additional data when considering the top 10 ranked documents. Our method shows promising results even with smaller training sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating hard negatives early in the training process. This suggests that hard negatives significantly enhance the models ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant documents against given query, even when data is limited. This approach is particularly beneficial in enterprise contexts, where annotated data may be scarce, enabling quicker improvements in domain-specific retrieval performance. Models in the Study In our study we compared the performance of other finetuned re-ranker (Glass et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Raffel et al., 2020) and embedding models (Zhang et al., 2024; Nussbaum et al., 2024) using hard negatives generated by our proposed framework in Table 4. We benchmarked the BGE-Reranker (Xiao et al., 2023), NV-Embed (Lee et al., 2024) SalesforceSFR (Meng et al., 2024a,b) , jina-reranker (AI, 2023) and Cohere-Reranker (Cohere, 2023a,b), long documents showing lower performance. Here, we analyze potential reasons and propose mitigation strategies. Challenges with Long Documents. Semantic Redundancy: Long documents often contain repetitive or tangential content, diluting their relevance to specific query. Context Truncation: Fixed-length tokenization (e.g., 512 or 1024 tokens) truncates long documents, potentially discarding critical information. Query-to-Document Mismatch: Short queries may not provide sufficient context to match the nuanced information spread across lengthy document. Potential Solutions. Chunk-Based Retrieval: Split long documents into smaller, semantically coherent chunks and rank them individually. Hierarchical Embeddings: Use hierarchical models to aggregate sentenceor paragraphlevel embeddings for better context representation. Query Expansion: Enhance short queries with additional context using techniques like query rewriting or pseudo-relevance feedback. This analysis highlights the need for future work to address the inherent challenges of ranking long documents effectively. A.5 Practical Implications for Enterprise"
