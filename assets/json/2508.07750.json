Introduction The recent breakthroughs in the reasoning ability of large language models, including DeepSeek and OpenAI, have shown that Alignment can bring remarkable improvements to the models reasoning ability. Numerous companies and researchers in the past have demonstrated that the alternation between supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) processes can enhance the reasoning ability of models through knowledge injection and reinforcement exploration, which has been validated in complex reasoning tasks including mathematics. However, the optimization of the alignment process is still empirical, such as how much data to use for SFT or RL at each stage, the order of SFT and RL, and the number of times they alternate. In the exploration of the unified alignment method, researchers initially focused on the use of series of monitoring and fine-tuning methods.is method has high efficiency for knowledge injection, but it is easy to cause the problem of knowledge forgetting and the decline of the generalization of ood. The recently released model shows the strong potential of RL, indicating that the RL process has become an integral part of alignment because it strengthens the exploration ability of the model. Deepseek zero attempts to directly align the Pretrain model using only the RL process. This is an exciting attempt. Although it shows the problems of readability and instruction compliance, the evaluation shows that it has the ability of quite complex reasoning tasks. It provides the possibility for us to further explore unified alignment paradigm. However, the RL process has high requirements for the ability of the basic model. Taking GRPO as an example, an obvious problem is that when the model fails to produce correct answer after sampling times for problem, the sample will actually be discarded in the optimization process. The same problem also exists in PPO and other rlhf methods. This means that it has no way to solve the problems beyond its ability. In this paper, we propose unified alignment method, GRAO (group relative alignment optimization), and we propose direct alignment loss, combines the respective advantages of SFT knowledge injection efficiency improvement and RL active exploration, and maintains the exploration of its own sampling space while learning the reasoning ability beyond the scope of its ability. Intuitively, GRAO refers to the high-quality reasoning output, directly optimizes the reasoning results of the sampling space, only prefers to imitate the standard reasoning output when its reasoning results are wrong, and adjusts the learning direction of the sampling space it explores according to the policy reward. In this way, GRAO realizes dynamic adaptive adjustment imitation learning and self-driven exploratory learning. We have observed that the process of imitation exploration transcendence of the model to the offline policy output will not be limited by the SFTs offline policy output to the upper limit of learning, and will eventually be internalized into the models more universal reasoning ability. We have performed extensive tests on standard alignment tasks(Helpful and Harmless alignment). Compared with the traditional alignment paradigm (SFT/DPO/PPO/GRPO), it has increased over 57.70%,17.65% 7.95% and 5.18% points on average, indicating that GRAO makes the model obtain more in-depth and universal reasoning behavior in the whole training process. The main contribution of this paper is as follows. 1. We introduce novel alignment framework called GRAO (group relative alignment optimization) and proposed group direct alignment loss, which maintains the exploration of its own sampling space while learning the alignment ability beyond the scope of its ability. 2. We expound on the theoretical, empirical, and computational justification of GRAO, and analyzed the generation behavior of the post hoc analysis of model, which shows that the convergence of optimization and alignment ability imitate-explore-transcend processes of standard output. 3. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods significantly outperform existing approaches across various alignment tasks, indicating the robustness and effectiveness of GRAO. Moreover, our results reveal intriguing insights into the balance between exploration and exploitation in collaborative learning tasks, which could lead to further advancements in the development of intelligent systems capable of adaptive alignment."

            "content": "Alignment with Supervised Fine-Tuning Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is widely recognized as foundational methodology for aligning language models with human preferences. As demonstrated by Ouyang et al. (2022), training supervised policy serves as critical baseline for alignment, with instruction-tuned models from industry and academia heavily relying on this approach. While SFT predates modern reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks (Ziegler et al. 2020), recent studies underscore its enduring relevance: Tunstall et al. (2023) and Rafailov et al. (2024) empirically establish that SFT-trained models are prerequisites for stable convergence to preference-aligned outcomes. The efficiency of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is demonstrated through three key mechanisms. First, SFT optimizes sequence likelihood via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), avoiding complex policy-gradient computations by maximizing the conditional probability of groundtruth token predictions, πθ(yi,t q, yi,<t). Second, the normalization term 1 yi ensures equal contribution from responses of varying lengths, maintaining computational efficiency. Third, the expectation Eq,yP (Q,Y ) operates on static human-labeled data, eliminating the need for interactive environments or reward modeling, unlike reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This approach simplifies gradient computation using standard cross-entropy loss, reducing noise and variance. Empirical evidence supports SFTs efficacy in aligning models with curated datasets, as shown in works like Zhou et al. (2023a), where even limited high-quality samples suffice, and Haggerty and Chandra (2024), which refines SFT models iteratively. JSFT(θ) = E(q,y)P (Q,Y ) 1 y (cid:88) t=1 log πθ(y,t q, y,<t) (1) The efficancy of SFT is further evidenced by its application in constructing human-aligned models through curated datasets. For instance, Zhou et al. (2023a) demonstrate that even limited high-quality training samples suffice to develop highly capable AI assistants, while Haggerty and Chandra (2024) propose an iterative alignment framework where SFT models are refined via selective fine-tuning on their own filtered generations. Similarly, Zhou et al. (2023b) validate that alignment can be achieved through strategically curated subsets of preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward modeling. The interplay between SFTs practical efficacy and its theoretical foundations is systematically analyzed by Chu et al. (2025), who posit that SFT plays critical role in memorizing alignment patterns, thereby stabilizing model outputs and enabling rapid convergence to high-performance regimes. These collective findings reaffirm SFTs dual significance: as both standalone alignment mechanism and stabilizing precursor for advanced optimization techniques. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages preference modeling frameworks such as the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry 1952) to estimate pairwise comparison probabilities between model outputs. central component of RLHF involves training reward model to score responses, which is subsequently optimized by reinforcement learning algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al. 2017) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al. 2024). These algorithms iteratively refine the language model to maximize the expected reward for human-preferred outputs, thereby aligning model behavior with human values (Stiennon et al. 2022; Ziegler et al. 2020). Recent advancements in RLHF focus on enhancing alignment through generative reward modeling. For example, Mahan et al. (2024) demonstrate that generative reward models, which synthesize preference signals directly from language model outputs, yield measurable improvements in alignment performance. Parallel efforts explore scaling feedback mechanisms beyond human annotation: Lee et al. (2024) formalize Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF), showing that automated feedback from auxiliary language models can rival human evaluators in steering alignment (Bai et al. 2022b; Pang et al. 2023). Crucially, RLHF not only aligns model outputs but also amplifies the models intrinsic reasoning capabilities. Empirical studies by Chu et al. (2025) reveal that outcome-based reward signals during RL training enhance the models ability to generalize in complex reasoning tasks, suggesting that RLHF strengthens both surface-level alignment and deeper cognitive architectures. This dual improvement underscores RLHFs role as catalyst for developing robust, human-aligned AI systems capable of sophisticated problem-solving."

            "content": "Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have catalyzed paradigm shift towards direct preference optimization, circumventing the conventional reward modeling pipeline. Novel frameworks such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al. 2024), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) (Ethayarajh et al. 2024), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) (Azar et al. 2023) exemplify this trend by redefining alignment as token-level optimization challenge. Rafailov et al. (2024) introduced DPO, an approach that consolidates the reward modeling and preference optimization stages into unified training objective, eliminating the need for explicit reward function approximation. Expanding on this concept, Ethayarajh et al. (2024) proposed IPO, which employs regularization mechanism to reduce overfitting. IPO achieves this by constraining policy updates in manner that preserves the relative preferences of unchanged responses, ensuring robustness in optimization. Concurrently, Azar et al. (2023) advanced KTO, which abandons reliance on pairwise preference data entirely. Instead, KTO utilizes pointwise human judgments informed by prospect theory, aligning optimization with inherent human cognitive biases while maintaining competitive performance. Collectively, these approaches substantiate the feasibility and computational efficiency of direct preference alignment. By eschewing traditional reward modeling and focusing on token-level preference optimization, these methods offer interpretable and scalable alternatives to conventional RLHF pipelines. Moreover, this shift embodies broader theoretical insight: explicit reward functions may be redundant intermediaries when human preferences can be directly encoded into policy gradients through meticulously designed loss functions. Such advancements not only streamline alignment mechanisms but also open new avenues for harnessing human cognition in model training paradigms."

Progressive Refinement: Alignment regularization (λ ˆAoi differential) amplifies high-advantage trajectories while suppressing low-reward paths 3. Stable Ascent: Advantage normalization prevents gradient explosion during exploration, maintaining monotonic improvement Post-convergence (steps > 800 in Fig. 2), baseline methods exhibit divergent behaviors: PPO plateaus due to KLdivergence constraints, while GRPO shows 9.6% reward variance from group sampling instability.

Our investigation reveals two distinct optimization phases: Rapid Alignment Phase (Steps < 200): The total optimization loss remains elevated with imitation (Jimitation) and alignment regularization (Jalignment regularizer) dominating the objective landscape (constituting >82% of loss magnitude). This configuration enables swift policy convergence toward optimal behavior by leveraging reference answers while constraining trajectory divergence. Refinement Phase (Steps > 200): Total loss decays exponentially while the objective distribution undergoes fundamental restructuring. Exploration (Jexploration) becomes the predominant component (5261% of total loss), whereas imitation contributions diminish to <40%. This shift signifies that the policys own generations supersede reference outputs as the primary optimization driver, enabling continuous improvement beyond imitation targets. These observations experimentally validate GRAOs imitate-explore-transcend paradigm. The phased optimizationwhere imitation anchors initial learning, exploration discovers superior trajectories, and alignment regularization orchestrates their integrationexplains GRAOs enhanced efficiency. Crucially, the dominance of exploration during refinement demonstrates the policys capability to transcend its reference starting points, achieving autonomous capability advancement while maintaining alignment stability.

Our experiments demonstrate that GRAO achieves particularly significant performance gains on sparse MoE architectures compared to dense models.

This contrasts with: SFT: Delivers minimal information (talented singer) without substantive details DPO: Includes relevant facts but omits artistic characteristics and notable works GRPO: Focuses narrowly on awards without contextualizing artistic significance GRAO achieves higher information density than the SFT/DPO/GRPO while maintaining factual accuracy, demonstrating its ability to synthesize comprehensive responses from reference material. Query 2: Cultural Sensitivity  (Table 5)  For the import car popularity question, GRAO uniquely identifies cultural similarity as the determining factor in consumer preferences. Baseline methods exhibit critical flaws: SFT: Shows severe repetition (2x redundant sentences) indicating poor attention control DPO: Introduces irrelevant luxury car brands (German/Italian) not present in context GRPO: Makes factually incorrect claims about geographic proximity determining preferences Notably, GRAO avoids harmful stereotyping while providing sociologically plausible explanation aligned with the reference responses intent. This demonstrates its effectiveness at navigating culturally sensitive topics where baseline methods either hallucinate (DPO), contradict facts (GRPO), or exhibit compositional failures (SFT). These case studies validate our quantitative findings, showing GRAOs dual strengths in helpful alignment tasks: (1) Information synthesis - integrating multiple knowledge dimensions into coherent responses, and (2) Cultural alignment - maintaining appropriateness on sensitive topics where baseline methods frequently deviate. Conclusion This paper introduces Group Relative Alignment Optimization (GRAO), an innovative alignment framework that successfully bridges the efficiency of supervised fine-tuning learning. with the exploratory power of reinforcement GRAO establishes new paradigm in language model alignment through its adaptive optimization mechanism, which dynamically orchestrates knowledge acquisition and exploration according to an imitate-explore-transcend trajectory. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis confirms GRAOs convergence properties, while extensive experiments validate its superior performance across multiple dimensions. The framework demonstrates remarkable 57.70%, 17.65%, 7.95%, and 5.18% improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO baselines respectively on complex alignment tasks, with particularly significant gains on Figure 4: Training Loss during GRAO alignment (Qwen2.57B, helpful-base) Figure 5: Percentage Contribution of Each Component to Total GRAO Optimization Loss (Qwen2.5-7B, helpful-base) alignment versus the dense Qwen2.5-7B model. This enhanced efficacy stems from fundamental synergies between GRAOs optimization dynamics and MoE architectural characteristics: Gradient Sparsity Alignment: MoE architectures exhibit inherent gradient sparsity patterns due to expert routing. GRAOs advantage-normalized gradients: (cid:100)J = 1 (cid:88) i= ˆAi σA (i) naturally concentrate updates on high-impact parameters, reducing interference between expert modules This demonstrates GRAOs versatility across model families, establishing it as unifying alignment framework for next-generation heterogeneous architectures.

Assistant: Sure. Shes very popular singer. Yes, do. Shes very talented singer. Yes, am familiar with Adele. She is British singer-songwriter who has achieved great success in the music industry. Yes, am familiar with Adele. She has won numerous awards, including multiple Grammy Awards. Yes, she is British singer-songwriter known for her soulful voice and powerful ballads. She has won numerous awards, including multiple Grammy Awards. Some of her most popular songs include Someone Like You, Rolling in the Deep, and Hello. Table 5: Case study: Helpful alignment on query Human: Are import cars still popular? Assistant: think can help! According to 2019 survey, most Americans would prefer to buy Japanese or Korean car, because they have high-value perception. These two countries are especially famous for their car-manufacturing. Human: So they are more valued? Assistant: Yes. When most people think about car-manufacturers, Japanese and Korean companies are the first to come to mind, and thats why these companies are so popular. Yes, they are more valued. But think its also important to note that the US is big market, and there are many different types of cars. So its not surprising that some people prefer to buy American cars, or cars from other countries. Its also important to note that the US is big market, and there are many different types of cars. So its not surprising that some people prefer to buy American cars, or cars from other countries. Yes, thats right! Japanese and Korean cars are known for their high quality and reliability, which makes them more valued by consumers. However, there are still many people who prefer to buy import cars from other countries, such as Germany, Italy, and the United States. These cars are often more expensive, but they are also known for their luxury and performance. Yes, they are more valued. The survey also shows that Americans are more likely to buy car from country that is close to their own. For example, Americans are more likely to buy car from Canada or Mexico than from country that is far away, like Japan or Korea. Yes. The survey also shows that Americans are more likely to buy car from country that is culturally similar to their own. For example, Americans are more likely to buy car from Japan, because Japan is country that is culturally similar to the United States. MoE architectures (achieving up to 22.74% NAG improvement over GRPO). ally appropriate responses while avoiding common failure modes of baseline methods. GRAOs effectiveness stems from its principled threecomponent design: imitation learning for rapid policy initialization, advantage-weighted exploration for efficient improvement, and alignment regularization for stable optimization. This unique combination addresses critical challenges in LLM alignment including reward sparsity, policy instability, and exploration inefficiency. Our trajectory analysis reveals GRAOs accelerated convergence (50% faster than alternatives) and stable optimization properties, enabled by its phased optimization mechanism that progressively transitions from imitation to autonomous capability advancement. Qualitative case studies further demonstrate GRAOs advantages in generating comprehensive, culturThe framework provides robust, scalable solution for aligning large language models, demonstrating particular strengths in maintaining alignment stability during capability progression, adapting to diverse model architectures, and efficiently utilizing both reference data and learned preferences. GRAOs consistent performance across both dense and sparse MoE models positions it as versatile solution for next-generation architectures. These advances establish strong foundation for developing more capable and aligned AI systems, with promising future directions including extensions to multi-objective alignment scenarios and continual learning settings.
