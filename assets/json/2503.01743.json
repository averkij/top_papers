            "content": "The Phi family of models [AJA+24, AAB+24] have shown that carefully curated and synthesized data enables Small Language Models (SLMs) to achieve highly competitive performance despite having significantly smaller number of parameters. These models demonstrate comparable results to much larger models. Building on the success of the Phi family of language models, we extend their capabilities to handle additional modalities such as vision and audio, achieving significant progress akin to private models like GPT [HLG+24], Claude [Ant24], and Gemini [TGL+24]. In this report, we introduce Phi-4-Multimodal, unified multimodal SLM that supports multiple inference modes combining various modalities (e.g., text-only, text + image, speech/audio, speech + image) within single model checkpoint. Phi-4-Multimodal employs novel mixture of LoRAs technique, enabling multimodal capabilities by integrating modality-specific LoRAs while keeping the base language model entirely frozen. Our findings show this technique outperforms existing approaches (e.g., cross-attention designs [ADL+22, AI23]) and achieves comparable performance to fully fine-tuned hanyh@microsoft.com, youki@microsoft.com 1Please note that reasoning-enhanced Phi-4-Mini is separate model and currently in preview stage and will not be released concurrently with Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal. 1 models on multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, the design of Phi-4-Multimodal is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new LoRAs to support additional modalities without impacting existing ones. Our training process comprises multiple stages, including language training (encompassing both pretraining and post-training) and then expansion of the language backbone to vision and speech/audio modalities. For the language model, we train Phi-4-Mini using high-quality, reasoning-rich text data. Notably, we include curated, high-quality code datasets to enhance performance on coding tasks. Once the language model training is complete, we freeze the language model and implement our Mixture of LoRAs technique to proceed with the multimodal training stage. Specifically, we train two additional LoRA modules alongside modality-specific encoders and projectors to enable vision-related tasks (e.g., vision-language and vision-speech) and speech/audio-related tasks (e.g., speech-language). Both of them contain pretraining and post-training stages for modality alignment and instruction finetuning, respectively. We also explore the reasoning potential of Phi-4-Mini to create compact yet powerful model that rivals substantially larger state-of-the-art reasoning systems, such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B [GYZ+25]. The key contributions of this model are listed below. 1. Unified Multi-Modality Support: In contrast to existing methods [Tea25b, CWW+24] that employ separate models for different modalities, Phi-4-Multimodal is designed as unified model capable of efficiently handling multiple modality scenarios. By leveraging the Mixture of LoRAs [HSW+22], Phi-4-Multimodal extends multimodal capabilities while minimizing interference between modalities. This approach enables seamless integration and ensures consistent performance across tasks involving text, images, and speech/audio. 2. Remarkable Language Performance for the size: The language models achieve state-ofIt the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation for its size category. demonstrates exceptional reasoning and mathematical capabilities, making it well-suited for complex problem-solving and knowledge-based tasks. 3. Outstanding Code Understanding and Generation for the size: The language models achieve state-of-the-art performance on code-related tasks within its size category. The model excels at tasks such as code synthesis, debugging, and documentation generation, empowering developers and aiding in software engineering workflows. 4. Superior Multi-Modal Capabilities for the size: The model delivers state-of-the-art performance across multi-modal tasks for its size category, demonstrating robust integration of diverse data types. This includes tasks that involve combining images with text and speech modalities, enabling multi-modal reasoning. 5. Exceptional Speech and Audio Performance: The model achieves strong performance especially on multilingual speech recognition and translation tasks, and is the first open-sourced model with speech summarization capability. 6. Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities: The reasoning-optimized version of Phi-4-Mini demonstrates superior reasoning abilities for model in its size category."

Phi-4-Mini consist of 32 Transformer layers with hidden state size of 3,072 and tied input / output embedding which reduces the memory consumption significantly while providing much wider coverage of vocabularies compared Phi-3.5. Each Transformer block includes an attention mechanism based on Group Query Attention (GQA) [ALTdJ+23], which optimizes key and value memory (KV cache) usage for long-context generation. Specifically, the model employs 24 query heads and 8 key/value heads, reducing KV cache consumption to one-third of its standard size. Additionally, in the RoPE configuration [SAL+24], fractional RoPE dimension is used, ensuring that 25% of the attention head dimension remains positionagnostic. This design supports smoother handling of longer contexts. To determine the peak learning rate, we follow [BBC+24] with LR(D) = BD0.32 where is constant we tune for this specific model and is the total number of training tokens.

            "title": "2.2 Multimodal model architecture",
            "content": "To integrate vision as an input modality, numerous vision-language models have been developed, including the LLava series [LLWL24, LLL+24, LZG+24], QWenVL series [BBY+23, WBT+24], InternVL series [CWT+24, CWW+24, CWC+24], InternLM-XComposer series [ZDW+23, DZZ+24b], Molmo [DCL+24], and NVLM [DLW+24]. Similarly, for audio input, notable contributions include Qwen2-Audio [CXY+24], InternLM-XComposer2.5-Omnilive [ZDC+24], InternOmni, Mini-Omni [XW24], and GLM4-Voice [ZDL+24]. However, in order to enable modality-specific functionality, these multimodal models generally require fine-tuning the base language model, which often diminishes its original language capabilities. Consequently, supporting diverse input signals without compromising quality necessitates deploying multiple modelsa particularly challenging limitation for resource-constrained devices. To address this, LLamaVision [DJP+24] adopts strategy inspired by Flamingo [ADL+22], adding extra cross-attention layers while preserving the core language model. However, this approach will result in reduced performance on vision-language benchmarks compared to fully fine-tuned models. To fill the performance gap, NVLM [DLW+24] further explores hybrid framework, employing joint supervised fine-tuning with high-quality text SFT data. Yet, this approach only examines limited language benchmarks and does not address additional training stages often required after SFT. We adopt the mixture of LoRAs design for our Phi-4-Multimodal architecture to support variant multi-modality use cases. Different LoRAs are trained to handle interactions between different modalities. Our Phi-4-Multimodal supports vast range of tasks, including single/multiple images QA/summarization, video QA/summarization, vision-speech tasks, speech QA/summarization/translation/recognition, and audio understanding, while maintains the original language model performance. 2https://github.com/openai/tiktoken 3 Figure 1: overview of the Multimodal architecture for Phi-4-Multimodal"

            "content": "Vision modality. The vision modality is implemented with an image encoder, projector to align the vision and text embeddings and LoRA adaptor. The vision encoder is based on SigLIP-400M that is finetuned with LLM2CLIP [HWY+24] on large scale image-text pairs with resolution 448 448 . The projector is 2-layer MLP that maps the vision features dimension to the text embedding dimension. Extra LoRA is added on all the linear layers in the language decoder and only deployed in the supervised fine tuning (SFT) stage. The image encoder and projector introduce 440M model parameters while the vision adapter LoRAV consumes another 370M model parameters. In order to enable the model to process images with diverse resolution effectively and efficiently, we proposed new dynamic multi-crop strategy. Specifically, given target image, we first compute the crop number for each side by dividing the original size by the crop-size, i.e. , where H, W, are the image height, width and crop size respectively. If the total crop number is within the maximum number, i.e., 16 in the pretraining stage and 36 in SFT, we just slightly resize the image to let it fit the size given by the computed image crops. Otherwise, we will leverage the strategy proposed in InternVL2 [CWW+24] that find the crop number by matching the best aspect ratio. Compared to InternVL2, the key benefits of our strategy is to avoid resizing one small image (e.g., 28 448) to unreasonable large size when looking for the closest image aspect ratio. Speech and Audio Modality: The speech/audio inputs we used are 80-dim log-Mel filter-bank features with the frame rate of 10ms. To enable Phi-4-Multimodal speech and audio functions, we connect pre-trained audio encoder and Phi-4-Mini through an audio adapter. In addition, LoRA is applied on the language decoder to improve the performance of speech/audio benchmarks while preserving the text capability. The introduced modules for the speech/audio modality include: An audio encoder, which consists 3 convolutions layers and 24 conformer blocks [GQC+20] with 1024 attention dimensions, 1536 feed-forward dimensions, and 16 attention heads. The convolution layers contribute to sub-sampling rate of 8, and thus 80ms token rate for the language decoder. An audio projector, which is 2-layer MLP that maps the 1024-dim speech features to the text embedding space of 3072 dimensions, similar to the vision projector. LoRAA that has been applied to all attention and MLP layers in Phi-4-Mini with rank of 320. The audio encoder and projector introduce 460M parameters while LoRAA consumes another 460M parameters. Note that the speech token rate is 80ms, indicating 750 tokens for 1-minute audio."

            "content": "The multimodal training stages include vision training, speech/audio training and vision-speech joint training. Vision Training. The overall training pipeline for multimodal learning consists of vision training, speech and audio training, and joint vision-audio training. Vision training follows four-stage process: 1) Projector Alignment stage: initially, only the projector is trained using caption data to align vision and text embeddings while preserving the pretrained representation of the vision encoder. 2) Joint Vision Training stage: Next, the projector and vision encoder are jointly trained on the full vision pretraining dataset to enhance key vision capabilities, such as OCR and dense understanding. 3) Generative VisionLanguage Training stage: LoRA is then deployed on the language decoder and trained alongside the vision encoder and projector using curated single-frame SFT data, equipping the model with generative capabilities for vision-language inputs. 4) Multi-Frame Training stage: Finally, the model is trained on multi-frame SFT data with the vision encoder frozen, extending the context length coverage to 64k and enabling multi-image and temporal understanding. Speech and Audio Training. With the Phi-4-Mini language model, we conduct two-stage paradigm for speech and audio training, also known as speech/audio pre-training and post-training. In the pre-training stage, we use large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) data to align the audio encoder and Phi-4-Mini in the semantic space. In this stage, the encoder and projector is updated with learning rate of 4e-5 for 50k steps while the language decoder is frozen. We initialize the audio encoder with pre-trained encoder from the attention-based encoder decoder (AED) ASR model. After the pre-training stage, the model can only perform the ASR task. To unlock the instruction following capability of Phi-4-Multimodal for variety of speech and audio tasks, we continue to train the model with about 100M curated speech and audio SFT samples (after weighted up) as the speech post-training stage. Please refer to Section 3.4.2 for data details. In speech/audio post-training, the audio encoder is frozen. We update the audio projector and LoRAA with learning rate of 1e-4 for another 50k steps. We consider different maximum audio lengths for different tasks in post-training. For speech summarization task, we train up to 30-minute audio (22.5k tokens). For other tasks, the maximum audio exposed in training is 30s (375 tokens). If we consider the 128k context length for language decoder, theoretically Phi-4-Multimodal can support maximum 2.8 hours of audio as out of the box inference. It is worth noting that we have not fine tuned the model on such long audio data and it may need further fine tuning to practically support such use cases. Vision-speech Joint Training. The vision-speech joint training is conducted after vision posttraining and speech post-training. We freeze the language base model, audio encoder, and audio projector, while finetuning the vision adapter LoRAV , vision encoder, and the vision projector. In this stage, we train the model mainly on vision-speech SFT data but we also include mixture of language and vision post-training data to maintain the corresponding performance. Reasoning Training Recent studies have suggested that training robust reasoning model only requires small amount of high-quality data, such as LIMO [YHX+25] and S1K [MYS+25]. However, we propose fundamentally different training paradigm for SLM: first, we need to conduct pre-training phase on extensive reasoning data to capture general reasoning chains, and then perform careful fine-tuning on curated SFT or preference data. The continued training of Phi-4-Mini for reasoning proceeds in three distinct stages. First, building on Phi-4-Mini, the model is pre-trained on approximately 60 billion reasoning CoT tokens generated by frontier reasoning LLMs, after which rejection sampling is employed to filter out incorrect outputs. This allows the reasoning extension of Phi-4-Mini to learn the reasoning chains produced by these models. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned on smaller but carefully curated dataset of around 200K high-quality CoT samples, chosen to cover diverse domains and varying difficulty levels. Finally, in the third stage, we label filtered incorrect outputs as dis-preferred and their corrected counterparts as preferred, compiling new dataset of 300K preference samples for DPO training."

Better math and coding data: For the math and coding data, we have augmented our original data with specific instruction-based math and coding data set. This enhancement has resulted in effective results in math, coding and reasoning. 3. Better synthetic data: we incorporated Phi-4 synthetic data [AAB+24] into this model training with the same processing and decontamination. 4. Better data mixture: With the better classifiers, we re-tuned the data mixture with ablation experiments. Especially we increased the ratio for the reasoning data.

We use both the real and synthetic speech/audio data during speech post-training, covering the majority of speech and audio understanding tasks. All the SFT data are formatted as: < user >< audio > {task prompt} < end >< assistant > {label} < end > where task prompt is to describe each task in the natural language description and it is null for the SQQA task. Speech Recognition Data. ASR training data contains about 20k hours anonymized in-house, and 20k hours selected public transcribed speech recordings that span eight languages. The weighted ASR training data contributes to 28M SFT examples. Speech Translation Data. AST training data contains about 30K hours of anonymized in-house and public speech data with translations in two directions: from 7 languages to English and from English to 7 languages. This data contains both supervised and synthetic translation from machine translation model. The AST data is created with two formats: direct ST and ASR + translation in Chain-ofthoughts (CoT) manner, contributing to 28M weighted training examples in post-training. Speech and Spoken Query Question Answering Data. SQA and SQQA training data contain synthetic QA pairs from real speech and synthetic audio from text SFT data. Synthetic QA pairs for SQA: To enable SQA capability, we reuse the speech-transcript pairs in the ASR training data and prompt the language model to generate multiple text QA pairs for each transcript. The low-quality QA pairs are filtered during training. Synthetic spoken query (audio) for SQQA: SQA is tasked to respond speech context plus text query. Responding to spoken query directly is also an important capability for Phi-4-Multimodal. Consequently, We sample from the language post-training data and convert the text query to audio query using our internal zero-shot TTS system. Synthetic LM response for SQQA: Similar to [FWL+24], we synthetically generate responses for speech prompts by prompting the language model with the ASR transcripts of those prompts. The LM response data can improve the SQQA robustness of Phi-4-Multimodal in real scenarios because of more diverse spoken queries sampled from the ASR training data. The total SQA and SQAQA data contribute to 26M weighted SFT examples. 3The speech interface supports the following 8 languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. 8 Speech Summarization Data. The summarization training data is assembled from anonymized audio recordings paired with their transcripts. The audio consists of multi-speaker conversational speech that spans range of topics. Rather than dividing the audio into shorter segments, we maintain its full length up to maximum of 30 minutes. To construct query-summary pairs for each audio clip, we use GPT-4 to generate variety of queries and their respective summaries based on the transcripts. For each audio clip, the summarization queries address specific or general aspects of the conversation and vary in format, including length (number of words or sentences) and structure (summaries formatted as bullet points, JSON, or email). The weighted dataset contributes to 1M SFT examples with English speech only. Audio Understanding Data. The audio understanding data contributes to around 17M weighted SFT examples sourced from public. The dataset is created in the form of (audio, question, answer) tuples, where audio contains speech, audio, and music inputs. Similar to [GLL+23], the question and answer pairs are generated from GPT4 based on audio transcripts and/or meta information. In addition the task-specific data, we also include audio safety data in speech/audio post-training. Please refer to Sec. 5.2 for the details of audio safety data. For all the public data, we utilize our Azure PII Detector4 to identify and handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The training examples with PII detected are removed for privacy concerns."

Additionally, we compare Phi-4-Multimodal with multiple state-ofthe-art open-source models: our previous Phi-3.5-Vision [AJA+24], Qwen2.5-VL-3B & 7B [Tea25b], InternVL2.5-4B & 8B [CWC+24], and close-sourced multimodal models Gemini [TAB+23], Claude3.5 [Ant24]5, and GPT-4o [HLG+24]6. For most benchmarks, we used the same internal evaluation pipeline as in Phi-3.5-Vision [AJA+24] to ensure fair comparisons across all baseline methods. For benchmarks (e.g., DocVQA and InfoVQA) requiring submission to an evaluation server, we directly utilized results reported in previous papers for baseline methods and submitted our own evaluations to the server to obtain results for Phi-4-Multimodal. For single-image vision-language benchmarks, the evaluations assess reasoning and perceptual capabilities across various domains, including but not limited to science, charts, OCR, and general knowledge. For multi-image/video vision-language benchmarks, we used one multi-image benchmark (BLINK [FHL+24]) and one video benchmark (VideoMME [FDL+24]). In the case of VideoMME, the evaluation setup is same as the one used in Phi-3.5-Vision [AJA+24], where 16 frames are extracted from each video by sampling frames at rate ensuring uniform time coverage. These benchmarks evaluate perceptual capabilities across multiple images/frames and text, covering scenarios such as art and style recognition, forensic detection, and video understanding.

Since Claude and GPT-4o endpoints do not support audio input along with images, we do not report their numbers here. For Gemini models, promting with only image and speech input will generate free-form responses that are difficult to extract and evaluate. Therefore, we add the corresponding text instructions to prompt the model to respond with one of ABCD options or single-word-or-phrase answers for the respective ShareGPT4o benchmark. From the results in Table 1 and Table 2, we summarize Phi-4-Multimodals performance as follows: On vision-language benchmarks, Phi-4-Multimodal demonstrates significant improvements over our previous model Phi-3.5-Vision [AJA+24] and outperforms baseline models of similar sizes overall. Notably, in chart understanding and science reasoning tasks, Phi-4-Multimodal even surpasses some close-sourced models like Gemini and GPT-4o. We have shown one demo case in Figure 2. On vision-speech benchmarks, Phi-4-Multimodal significantly outperforms InternOmni and 10 Figure 2: One demo case to show the vision-language understanding and reasoning capability of Phi-4-Multimodal. Gemini-2.0-Flash by large margin, which have larger model sizes. For instance, on ShareGPT4o AI2D and ShareGPT4o ChartQA benchmarks, Phi-4-Multimodal achieves more than 10 points higher performance than InternOmni. Unlike other open-source vision-language models that fully fine-tune their base language models (often resulting in performance degradation on pure language benchmarks), Phi-4-Multimodal keeps the language model entirely frozen by only incorporating additional fine-tunable LoRA modules. This approach ensures that language performance remains unchanged for pure text inputs. While some academic efforts aim to enable multimodal capabilities while preserving original language performance (e.g., through added cross-attention layers [AI23, DLW+24]), these techniques often lead to performance drops on vision-language benchmarks compared to fully fine-tuned large language models. Our proposed LoRA solution provides novel perspective for the community, maintaining language capabilities while achieving minimal performance loss on multimodal benchmarks compared to fully fine-tuned baselines."

We sample the top-1 token at each generation step during inference. The main results on the speech benchmark are presented in Table 3. We summarize the performance of Phi-4-Multimodal as listed: Phi-4-Multimodal achieves very strong ASR and AST performance, surpassing the expert ASR model, WhisperV3, and expert AST model, SeamlessM4T-large-v2, on CommonVoice [ABD+20], FLEURS [CMK+23], OpenASR [SMK+23], and CoVoST2 [WWGP21] test sets. Phi-4-Multimodal is 5.5% relatively better in WER than the best model on the Huggingface OpenASR leaderboard8 and now ranks No.1 on the leaderboard as of 1/14/2025. Phi-4-Multimodal is the first open-sourced model with speech summarization capability. The summarization quality is close to that of GPT-4o in the sense of adherence and low hallucinations. Phi-4-Multimodal is the smallest open-sourced multi-modal LLM that behaves better than the open-sourced Qwen2-audio [CXY+24] with 2x in size. We should notice in Table 3 that Phi-4-Multimodal is optimized for speech and audio understanding tasks while Gemini and GPT-4o might be optimized towards chat experience. That may be the reason why Phi-4-Multimodal outperforms Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o on ASR and AST tasks while lags behind on the SQQA tasks. We describe the benchmark and evaluation details for each task below. Automatic Speech Recognition. We evaluate the ASR performance on three public benchmarks: CommonVoice [ABD+20], FLEURS [CMK+23], and OpenASR [SMK+23]. CommonVoice is an open-source, multilingual speech dataset developed by Mozilla. The test set of CommonVoice version 15.0 (CV15) is adopted in our evaluation, in which the data is collected before 9/13/2023.

The models are evaluated on the test sets of the eight supported languages for ASR. OpenASR Leaderboard on Hugging Face is designed for benchmarking and evaluating the robustness of ASR models on English. The datasets in the leaderboard cover diverse speech domains including reading speech, conversations, meetings, and so on. The ASR prompt for Phi-4-Multimodal is Transcribe the audio clip into text., which is language agnostic. We notice that the model can learn to recognize in the target language perfectly without providing language information, while Qwen2-audio and Gemini-2.0-Flash require the language information in the prompt to obtain the optimal ASR performance. For example, the ASR prompt for Gemini-2.0-Flash is Transcribe the audio clip into {tgt-lang}. Please ignore background noise. We compute the Character Error Rate (CER) for Japanese and Chinese language and Word Error Rate (WER) for other six languages. The detailed ASR results on the three benchmarks are summarized in Table 4. Overall, we achieve the new SOTA multi-lingual ASR performance on the eight supported languages, surpassing the expert ASR models like WhisperV3. Noticeably, Phi-4-Multimodal beats the best performing model, nvidia/canary-1b, by 5.5% relative WER on the Huggingface OpenASR leaderboard and now ranks No.1 in the leaderboard to date. Phi-4-Multimodal is also better than the open-sourced Qwen2-audio with doubled model size. Note that GPT-4o is very sensitive to ASR prompt. We tried many ASR prompts and present the one with the best overall ASR results we can obtain on the test sets. The ASR prompt we finally use is Capture the speech in written format in the language spoken, please. Dont include any information outside of the spoken content in your response. Remove any hesitation words like um, uh. Support mixed language. Your response should be formatted as follows: Spoken Content: <transcribed text here>.. 13 Automatic Speech Translation. We evaluate the AST performance on two public benchmarks: CoVoST2 [WWGP21] and FLEURS [CMK+23]. CoVoST2 is multilingual speech-to-text translation dataset derived from Mozillas Common Voice project. It is one of the largest open datasets available for speech translation, providing support for both X-to-English (X-En) and English-to-X (En-X) translation tasks. We evaluate the directions with supported languages on the test sets. We use the same FLEURS test audios as those in ASR evaluation but replacing the ASR transcription with the translations. We evaluate EN-X and X-EN directions with supported languages on the test sets. The AST prompts for 0-shot and CoT evaluation are Translate the audio to {tgt-lang}. and Transcribe the audio to text, and then translate the audio to {tgt-lang}. Use < sep > as separator between the original transcript and the translation., respectively. We compute BLEU score between the reference and text translations. For CoT evaluation, the text after < sep > is regarded as the translation. The detailed AST results on each translation direction are shown in Table 5. As we can see from the table, CoT inference can largely benefit the translation quality, improving 1-2 BLUE score on various test sets. Phi-4-Multimodal achieves the best AST performance among the evaluated models on CoVoST2 benchmark, including Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o. On FLEURS, Phi-4-Multimodal is better than the expert model SeamlessM4T-large-V2 and the performance is on par with GPT-4o, the size of which is much larger than Phi-4-Multimodal. We dont apply CoT evaluation to other models since either the model does not support CoT decoding, or it is hard to find good CoT prompt for the model to respond to each test sample correctly. Similar to ASR, Phi-4-Multimodal does not require source language information in the AST prompt. Spoken Query Question Answering. We evaluate the SQQA performance on two language benchmarks with synthetic audio query: MT-Bench [ZCS+23] and MMMLU [HBB+20]. The text query is synthesized into the audio query with the internal zero-shot TTS system. MT-Bench (Multi-turn Benchmark) is specifically designed to evaluate the conversational and instruction-following abilities of AI models in multi-turn question-answering (QA) scenarios. MMMLU (Multilingual Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate the general knowledge and reasoning capabilities of AI models across wide array of subjects. We evaluate the model on the eight supported languages for this test set. The task prompt is null for the spoken query QA task. The metrics are different for the two benchmarks. The answer for MT-bench is open-ended, so we use GPT-4 as judge to score the model outputs from 1 to 10. We evaluate the model outputs in the first two turns for MT-bench. Please refer to Appendix for the judege prompts for GPT-4. MMMLU is QA task with multiple-choice questions. We use the accuracy to measure the model quality. We summarize the SQQA results in Table 6. It can be seen from the table that Phi-4-Multimodal outperforms Qwen2-audio with doubled model size on MT-bench. However, the performance lags far behind than the Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o, which show strong SQQA capability. The results on SQQA show that Phi-4-Multimodal is more good at conversational chat rather than general knowledge and reasoning chat (less gap to closed-source models on MT-bench than that on MMMLU). The reason might be that we weighed more conversational SQQA data in the speech/audio post-training stage. 14 Table 5: Detailed results on AST benchmarks with BLEU () score reported. We use zh, ja-mecab, and 13a tokenizer in Sacrebleu [Pos18] to compute BLUE scores for Chinese, Japanese, and other six languages, respectively.

We evaluate the speech summarization performance on an in-house (Golden3) and public (AMI [CAB+05]) benchmark. Golden3 is real-world meeting dataset, containing 108 meeting recordings with corresponding transcripts, averaging 6 minutes each. The dataset is primarily in English, covering wide range of topics. There are in total 1071 queries for the entire dataset, averaging 9.9 instructions for each conversation. The AMI (Augmented Multi-Party Interaction) dataset is comprehensive collection of meeting recordings, encompassing approximately 100 hours of data. These recordings feature synchronized audio and video streams, including close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and roomview cameras, and outputs from devices like slide projectors and electronic whiteboards. The dataset is primarily in English and includes contributions from both native and non-native speakers, captured in various rooms with distinct acoustic properties. The test split contains 20 meeting recordings with average duration of 32 minutes. We test on close-talking version of audio. There are 10 instructions generated for each conversation, summing up to 200 for the dataset. To generate the summarization instructions for the test data, GPT-4 is employed being asked to summarize partial or the entire conversation or control the output style/length/structure. An example prompt could be Summarize the ideas shared for making the remote control suitable for older generations. or Summarize in bullet points the key product specifications discussed. The summarization instructions are regarded as task prompt for multi-model LLM inference. During evaluation, we use GPT4 to score the response corresponding to each instruction in 3 criteria: overall quality, hallucination, and instruction adherence. The overall quality, scaled 1 to 7, measures accuracy in capturing details, coherence, and writing style. The hallucination score is binary flag that measures whether any Table 6: Result details on speech QA/summarization/audio understanding tasks for multi-modal models. The scores are obtained using GPT-4-0613 as judge.

The adherence score, scaled 1 to 7, measures how well the response follows the instruction in specific format, content or length requirements. During scoring, GPT4 has access to the ground truth transcripts of each recording. Please refer to Appendix for the GPT4 scoring prompt. We average the scores of all responses belong to the same dataset for each criteria. The detailed summarization scores are presented in Table 6. Qwen2-Audio has 30-second cut-off for audio input, therefore it couldnt deal with long-form audio input and appears incompetent in this task. Phi-4-Multimodal instead can naturally encode long-form audio in one-shot and perform speech understanding. It exhibits competitive performance on both Golden3 and AMI test sets, compared with Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o. Considering that speech summarization data contributes only 1% of the data in speech post-training, the gap can be reduced easily with finetuning on more summarization data. Audio Understanding. We evaluate the audio understanding capability on two benchmarks: AIRBenchchat [YXL+24] and MMAU [STK+24]. AIR-Bench (Audio Instruction and Response Benchmark) is comprehensive evaluation framework designed to test the capabilities of large audio language models. It includes both foundation and chat benchmarks. The chat benchmark is selected for the open-end QA style evaluation. The chat benchmark includes the categories of music, sound, speech and mixed domain. The MMAU (Massive Multi-Task Audio Understanding) benchmark is comprehensive dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of multi-modal models in audio-based understanding and reasoning tasks. The test sets are in the form of multiple-choices QA, covering the categories of music, sound, and speech. Similar to open-ended QA as MT-bench, we use GPT-4-0613 as judge to score the model outputs. Figure 3: An example to showcase the understanding capabilities for Phi-4-Multimodal, including audio understanding, summarization, ASR, and AST. Please refer to the Appendix for the GPT4 scoring prompt. The accuracy is used to measure the model quality on MMAU. The detailed results on each category for multi-model models are presented in Table 6. Although we freeze the audio encoder in post-training, Phi-4-Multimodal achieves strong speech, audio, and music understanding capability on the two evaluated benchmarks, surpassing the open-sourced Qwen2audio. The GPT-4o does not perform well on the audio and music understanding tasks because the models may not respond to the audio/music inputs for some test samples. In other words, GPT-4o is either sensitive to the prompts for audio and music understanding tasks . We showcase an example for strong speech understanding capabilities of Phi-4-Multimodal in Figure 3."

            "content": "Our approach was almost identical to the one described in the Phi-3 Technical Report [AJA+24]. Further details can be found in the Phi-3 Safety Paper [Mic24]. The main improvement was to extend our Safety post-training datasets to all Tier 1 languages by performing (and verifying) machine translation with GPT-4o-mini model. Helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets [BJN+22, JLD+23] with modifications inspired by [BSA+24] and multiple in-house generated datasets were leveraged to address the RAI harm categories in safety post-training. An independent red team at Microsoft iteratively examined Phi-4-Mini to further identify areas of improvement during the post-training process. Based on their feedback, we curated additional datasets tailored to address their insights, thereby refining the post-training dataset. Systematic Safety evaluations were carried out as described in the Phi-3 Safety Paper [Mic24]. The main difference lied with our evaluations for Harmful Content, which now leverage Microsofts Azure AI Evaluation SDK. We used GPT-4o to simulate adversarial conversations with our model, and to evaluate the models responses toxicity along four harm categories: Violence, Sexual Content, Self-Harm, and Hateful Content. We then computed Defect Rate for each category - the fraction of responses that did contain harmful content. Table 10 shows that our models are on par with other models of similar size, and with our previously released Phi-3.5-mini (which is not surprising, due to the similar approach for safety alignment). To assess the vulnerability of the model to jailbreaks (JBs), we repeated the previous evaluation while prepending the simulated user prompts with known JBs. The results shown in table 11 allow us to draw 2 conclusions. First, our latest Phi models are more robust to jailbreaks than our previously released Phi-3.5-mini, and than other models of similar size. Second, our models seem to manage to detect the presence of JBs, and in such cases are even less likely to comply with prompts eliciting harmful responses. This can be seen from the Defect Rates being smaller than the ones obtained without JBs shown in table 10.

The Defect Rate denotes the fraction of model responses containing harmful content, when known jailbreaks are included in the user prompts. The last row shows the average Defect Rates across all 4 harm categories. To assess the ability of the model to refuse answering harmful prompts without sacrificing the ability to answer seemingly harmful but innocuous prompts, we leveraged the XSTest framework described in [RKV+23]. Two metrics were computed: the Refusal Rate to harmful prompts (IPRR a.k.a. Inappropriate Prompt Refusal Rate - the higher, the better) and the Refusal Rate to innocuous prompts (VPRR a.k.a. Valid Prompt Refusal Rate - the lower, the better). Results for Phi models and some competitor models are shown in table 12. Two conclusions can be drawn. First, both Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal are very good at refusing to answer harmful prompts. Second, when it comes to answering innocuous prompts, Phi-4-Multimodal errs little more on the safety side compared to the rest of the field.

IPRR is the Refusal Rate to inappropriate prompts (e.g. How can kill my neighbor?) - the higher, the better. VPRR is the Refusal Rate to valid prompts (e.g. How can kill python process?) - the lower, the better. We also evaluated the models tendency to produce harmful content across all Tier 1 languages by following the approach described above, that leverages the Azure AI Evaluation SDK. Defect Rates can be seen in table 13, where the numbers were averaged over the 4 harm categories (Violence, Sexual Content, Self-Harm, and Hateful Content) to produce single number per language. These results show an improvement for both Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal compared to Phi-3.5-mini, and show comparable performance to other competitor models."

            "title": "5.2 Audio safety",
            "content": "For the audio safety alignment of Phi-4-Multimodal, we followed an approach analogous to that of text safety alignment described above. Our audio safety datasets were obtained by performing TTS (Text-To-Speech) synthesis on our text safety datasets. We want to acknowledge two limitations of this approach. 1. Our audio safety datasets are voice-only. No other types of sounds (non-speech) were included. 2. We did not train against audio-specific jailbreaks. For audio safety evaluations, we carried out three families of automated evaluations. First, like we did with text inputs, we leveraged Microsofts Azure AI Evaluation SDK to detect the presence of harmful content in the models responses to speech prompts. The Defect Rates are shown in table 14. Although somewhat higher than those obtained with GPT-4o (a model of much bigger size), they are comparable to those shown in table 10 for text inputs. Defect Rate Violence Sexual Self-Harm Hateful Average Phi-4-Multimodal GPT-4o 4% 4% 1% 4% 3.25% 2% 1% 1% 0% 1% Table 14: RAI benchmark results for Phi-4-Multimodal and GPT-4o. The Defect Rate denotes the fraction of model responses containing harmful content, when the input prompt was an audio trace. The last row shows the average Defect Rates across all 4 harm categories. Second, we ran Microsofts Speech Fairness evaluation to verify that Speech-To-Text transcription worked well across variety of demographics - as measured by the WER metric. The audio samples were spread across 2 gender sub-groups, and 3 age sub-groups (17-30, 31-45, and 46-65). The following locales (corresponding to Tier 1 languages) were considered: it-IT, fr-FR, ja-JP, es-MX, pt-BR, es-ES, zh-CN, en-US, en-GB, and de-DE. No sub-group with egregiously worse performance than the overall population was found. Some sub-groups did have slightly better/worse performance than the overall population in their given locale. The sub-groups with slightly better performance than the overall population were: it-IT 17-30, es-MX 46-65, es-ES 17-30, en-US Female, en-US 46-65, and de-DE 46-65. The sub-groups with slightly worse performance than the overall population were: en-US Male and es-MX 17-30. Third, we implemented custom evaluation to assess whether the model would infer Sensitive Attributes (SAs) from the voice of user - ideally, it should not. The 12 SAs were: Race, Sexual Orientation, Political Orientation, Religious Beliefs, Trade Union Membership, Personality Characteristics, Age, Gender, Medical Conditions, Country or Region of Origin, Social Economic Status, and Profession). We used variety of voices and prepared hundreds of audio prompts containing prompt seed, and an explicit ask for the model to infer the SA. Prompt seeds were either generic truth (e.g. Fire is hot.) or first-person statement about the user that had no obvious relation to the SA (e.g. am 6 feet tall.). We then used GPT-4 to determine whether the model responses did contain an inference of the SAs. The results were as follows. Without any additional mitigation measure, Phi-4-Multimodal performed the inference of SA (ISA) on 27% of our test prompts less frequently than Qwen2-Audio (49%). For both models, Personality Characteristics and Country or Region of Origin were the SAs most likely to be inferred. ISA can be very well mitigated for Phi-4-Multimodal by using system prompt, which brings down the Defect Rate to 0.4% - comparable to the 2% we measured for GTP-4o deployed to real-time audio endpoint that uses Microsofts meta prompt to prevent ISA. In addition to these automated evaluations, extensive red teaming was performed by an independent group within Microsoft. The red teaming effort focused on the following safety areas: harmful content, self-injury risks, and exploits. Phi-4-Multimodal was found to be more susceptible to providing undesirable outputs when attacked with context manipulation or persuasive techniques. These findings apply to all languages, with the susceptibility to persuasive techniques mostly affecting French and Italian."

            "content": "To assess model safety in scenarios involving both text and images, we utilized Microsofts Azure AI Evaluation SDK. This tool enables the simulation of single-turn conversations with the target model by providing prompt text and images specifically designed to elicit harmful responses. The target models responses are then evaluated by fine-tuned GPT-4o model across multiple harm categories, including violence, sexual content, self-harm, hateful or unfair content. Each response is assigned severity score based on the level of harm identified. We compared the vision safety evaluation of Phi-4-Multimodal with those of Phi-3.5-Vision, open-source models of comparable size, as well as OpenAI models. In addition, we ran both an internal and the public RTVLM [LLY+24] and VLGuard [ZBY+24] multimodal (text & vision) RAI benchmarks. In table 15, we compare vision safety metrics of Phi-4-Multimodal with Phi-3.5-Vision, the open-source models Llava-1.6 [LLL+24] and Qwen-VL-Chat [BBY+23], as well as GPT4-V [Ope23].

            "content": "Due to the model size limitation, the model could not remember some specific facts such as information of Olympic games results. Also, multilingual capability is limited by the number of model parameters. As we emphasize more on the coding data, multilingual data ratio went down. This results in worse performance on other languages than English. Like every other model, both Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal can sometimes output undesirable content. We stress the importance for developers to implement application-level measures to further mitigate the impact of harmful responses. Mitigation strategies include (but are not limited to) system prompts, content filters, etc. Phi-4-Multimodal is not designed or intended to be used as biometric categorization system to categorize individuals based on their biometric data to deduce or infer their race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation."

Rate the summary on scale of 1 to 7 based on the following criteria: 2 3 1. If the summary fulfills the user's instructions comprehensively, accurately captures the required details, excludes any explicitly prohibited information, maintains the correct level of detail, adheres to the requested structure (e.g ., bullet points, paragraphs), and is both fluent and coherent, assign score of 7. The summary should read naturally, resembling human-written summary. Coherence means ideas are logical and well-connected, with smooth transitions. 4 5 2. If the summary mostly fulfills the user instructions but has minor issues, such as slight deviations in structure, missing small details, or minor readability issues, assign score of 5-6, depending on the severity of the deviation. Consider whether the issues are easy to fix and whether they affect the summary 's usability. 6 7 3. If the summary fulfills the majority of the instructions but includes unimportant or extra information, omits key details specified by the user, or diverges slightly in structure or emphasis, assign score of 4-5, depending on the significance of the issues. Weigh the importance of missing or extraneous content against the clarity and adherence to instructions. 8 9 4. If the summary partially adheres to the instructions, capturing some of the requested details but introducing inconsistencies, hallucinations, or irrelevant content, assign score of 2-4, depending on the extent of the deviations and errors. Penalize for any explicitly prohibited content that has been included. 10 11 5. If the summary minimally adheres to the instructions, misses most of the required details, includes significant irrelevant or hallucinated content, or ignores the specified structure or tone, assign score of 1-3, depending on the severity of the shortcomings. 12 13 6. If the summary fails to follow the user's instructions altogether, missing all critical requirements or containing high proportion of irrelevant or fabricated content, assign score of 1. This includes summaries that fail to meet any formatting, detail, or exclusion criteria. 14 37 15 Here is the input document, user instruction and the corresponding summary. 16 Source: ``` 17 18 {src} ``` 19 20 User Instruction: ``` 21 22 {instruction} ``` 23 24 Summary ``` 25 26 {tgt} ``` 27 28 Note: It is helpful to read the summary first, before reading the source document."
