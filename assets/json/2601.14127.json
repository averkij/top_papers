            "content": "Advancing MLLMs to comprehend complex instructions and visual inputs is essential for realworld problems (Hurst et al., 2024; Google, 2024). Recent models have made substantial progress in task compliance and multimodal reasoning, moving toward more general and robust multimodal intelligence (Comanici et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025). However, this rapid advancement raises natural question: do improved capabilities also expand the attack surface and introduce new safety risks? Most existing safety evaluations for MLLMs focus on content-based safety, where model is considered unsafe if it fails to refuse explicit harmful images. However, they neglect reasoningbased safety, where harm emerges only through the models reasoning process. In this work, we 1 Figure 1: Illustration of the side effect of being smart: as MLLMs reasoning improves, they move from failing to understand complex harmful request (Level 1) to providing detailed high-risk procedure (Level 3). study such risks in multi-image scenarios, focusing on cross-image interactions and user instruction. As illustrated in Figure 1, models with different capabilities exhibit distinct behaviors in multiimage reasoning task.1 less capable model limited to single-image inputs (Level 1) may fail to comprehend the underlying task, thus providing generic response. By contrast, the multi-image models (Levels 2 and 3) correctly infer the users intent but fail to recognize its latent harmful nature, thus proceed to answer it. Consequently, the intermediate model (Level 2) provides flawed and 1The three levels are consistent with their average scores on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning benchmark (MMR Avg. (OpenCompass Contributors, 2023)). incomplete pathway, whereas the strongest model (Level 3) generates detailed, high-risk procedure. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce MIR-SafetyBench, comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs multi-image reasoning safety. MIR-SafetyBench offers three key advantages: (1) Reasoning-based Design. Harmful intent emerges only when the model performs multi-step relational reasoning over multiple im- (2) Varied Relation ages and the instruction. Types. The benchmark contains 2,676 instances grouped into 9 relation types, broadly covering how multi-image relations can conceal or enable harmful intent. (3) Extensive Diversity. Starting from 600 curated harmful seed questions spanning 6 risk categories, we construct diverse set of multiimage instances that tests MLLMs across wide range of safety-critical scenarios. Our benchmark shows that multi-image relational attacks succeed widely across 19 MLLMs and that within broad range of models, stronger multi-image reasoning often coincides with higher ASR. To understand why weaker models appear safer, we introduce four-way taxonomy of safe response behaviors and show that many safe generations arise from misunderstanding, generic unexplained refusals, or evasive but uninformative answers rather than robust safety alignment. We further probe models internal states finding that only in multi-image scenarios do unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average, suggesting that reasoning-based safety failures may have distinct internal signatures and that MLLMs may tend to allocate their capacity to solving the underlying reasoning problem while neglecting safety constraints. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We construct MIR-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multiimage reasoning safety in MLLMs to our knowledge. It contains 2,676 instances with 24 images each, covering 9 multi-image relation types and 6 safety risk categories. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 popular MLLMs and show that these multi-image reasoning safety risks are pervasive. Moreover, these risks can increase as models multiimage reasoning capabilities improve. We distinguish genuine safety alignment from harmless behavior arising from model limitations, and we probe MLLMs internal states in multi-image safety tasks using attention entropy, identifying distinct internal signatures associated with unsafe generations."

The growing research interest in this area is evidenced by the recent emergence of dedicated multi-image understanding benchmarks, such as MuirBench (Wang et al., 2025) and MMIU (Meng et al., 2025). These works highlight the communitys focus on enhancing models capacity for complex relational and contextual reasoning, setting the stage for more sophisticated applications."

Early studies probed MLLMs vulnerabilities by injecting explicit harmful signals into images, such as render- (Gong et al., 2025) or using ing malicious text visuals related to unsafe keywords (Liu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2025). Subsequent work moved to more sophisticated evaluations, including large-scale automated red-teaming datasets (Luo et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b) and benchmarks probing crossmodality alignment, where individually benign inputs become harmful only when combined (Cui et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024a; Lee et al., 2025). In parallel, existing studies have indicated that stronger capabilities do not automatically yield safer behavior (Bostrom, 2012; Armstrong, 2013). Builded on the rapid progress of multi-image reasoning, recent attacks now exploit multi-image contexts directly through distraction-based multimodal jailbreaks (Yang et al., 2025b), heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution (Teng et al., 2024), visual chain reasoning attacks (Sima et al., 2025), and compositional multi-image jailbreaks (Ding 2 Figure 2: Examples of the nine relations in our proposed taxonomy. Each case hides harmful intent within the complex relationships across multiple images and textual prompt. et al., 2025). However, these works do not provide systematic benchmark for this task, and we address this gap by introducing MIR-SafetyBench.

Temporal Relations capture the temporal progression of an event, including: 1) Temporal Continuity, which gives sequence of images illustrating continuous progression of harmful event, guiding the model to generate feasible details for this event. 2) Temporal Jump, which presents two images depicting only the beginning and the end of harmful process (e.g., secure location and subsequent covert photo), and prompts the model to deduce and describe the intermediate actions."

            "content": "Each instance is generated via an iterative, five-step pipeline that converts single harmful question into multi-image reasoning task, as illustrated in Figure 3. Given seed question Qorig and target relation type r, the process is as follows: 1. Rewrite Harmful Question (Revisor). The Revisor (DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025)) transforms the direct harmful question Qorig (e.g., How to rob bank?) for given relation type into an indirect format consisting of textual prompt Pr, set of image descriptions {Dr,i}n i=1, and corresponding keywords {Kr,i}n i=1 (An example is shown in the bottom left of Figure 3). In subsequent iterations, it also incorporates feedback Fe from the Evaluator to refine its output. 2. Generate Images (Image Generator). The Image Generator produces the image set {Vr,i}n i=1. For each description-keyword pair (Dr,i, Kr,i), it synthesizes an image from Dr,i using FLUX.1dev (Labs et al., 2025) and combines the image with text rendering of Kr,i to create the final composite images (e.g., Vr,1 and Vr,2 in Figure 3). 3. Test the Attack (Tester). The generated instance (Pr, {Vr,i}n i=1) is then presented to the Tester agent (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) to simulate models response and obtain an initial answer Ar. This step checks whether the rewritten prompt maintains the original intent of Qorig, and whether it can elicit harmful response, ensuring only effective instances proceed to the final evaluation stages. 4. Harmfulness Judgement (Harmbench Judge). The Testers response Ar is passed to the judge HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls (Mazeika et al., 2024), standardized classifier widely used in safety research (Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhou et al., 2024b).

            "content": "The overall performance of the 19 MLLMs on MIRSafetyBench is presented in Table 1. First, vulnerability to multi-image relational reasoning is widespread phenomenon. Most of the evaluated models are susceptible, and the highest overall ASR is 87.63%. This widespread failure suggests that existing safety alignment strategies may be ill-equipped to handle risks that emerge from multi-image reasoning processes. Second, within broad range of models, our results are consistent with the Side Effects of Being Smart hypothesis. Single-image chat models that are not optimized for multi-image tasks, such as Llama3-LLaVA-NeXT-8B and LLaVA-v1.5-7B, show notably lower overall ASRs than models optimized for multi-image processing. Moreover, reasoning-enhanced variants often exhibit higher ASR than their base versions. For example, Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking exceeds Kimi-VLA3B-Instruct, and Skywork-R1V3-38B exceeds InternVL-38B. Larger parameter scales can also correlate with higher ASR within model family. However, the most capable closed-source models (e.g., GPT-5.1) combine strong reasoning capability with low ASR, indicating that this trade-off is not monotonic across the full capability spectrum. Overall, these patterns suggest potential capability-dependent trade-off: models operating at the edge of their abilities in multi-image reasoning tasks show positive correlation between reasoning strength and ASR. In contrast, frontier models find such tasks easier to navigate, allowing them to maintain or restore robustness. Finally, risks correlate with the tasks cognitive demand. Categories demanding more abstract, multi-step thinking consistently exhibit higher vulnerability. For instance, logical tasks like Decomposition and Causality frequently yield high ASRs across top models. In contrast, categories that rely on more direct pattern recognition, such as Semantic Relevance, tend to yield lower ASRs."

First, they highlight the brittleness of current safety alignments: models that perform reasonably well against direct single-image attacks (e.g., GPT-4o) show much higher ASR when the same harmful intent is reframed as multi-image relational puzzle.

            "content": "Our results suggest that improved multi-image reasoning may increase unsafe outputs. In this section, we probe models internal behavior to examine whether unsafe multi-image generations systematically differ from safe ones and how these patterns compare to the single-image setting. Motivation Behavioral deviations during complex problem solving may be attributed to limited processing resources (Norman and Bobrow, 1975). Analogously, we hypothesize that the complexity of multi-image reasoning can push MLLMs into similar state of cognitive overload. Cognitive load theory argues that human working memory has limited resources; when task is highly demanding, auxiliary goals are more likely to be ignored (Sweller, 2010). Recent evidence suggests analogous effects in LLMs under cognitive overload: extraneous tasks can facilitate jailbreaks (Upadhayay et al., 2024), competing prompt constraints can degrade both performance and safety (Yang et al., 2025a), and padding harmful requests with lengthy benign reasoning can weaken refusals(Zhao et al., 2025). 7 Figure 4: Heatmaps of attention entropy gaps between safe and unsafe cases, where red indicates larger discrepancy, for chat model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, top) and reasoning model (GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, bottom) in multi- ((a),(c)) and single-image ((b),(d)) settings. At more mechanistic level, recent work suggests form of zero-sum behavior in Transformers, whose effective capacity is bounded by finite number of attention heads (Gong and Zhang, 2024). In parallel, entropy has been used as proxy for human cognitive control load (Fan, 2014) and attention entropy has been applied to LLMs focus and load-like effects (Zhang et al., 2025b; Shang et al., 2025). Motivated by these findings, we use attention entropy to probe an MLLMs internal cognitive state under multi-image reasoning. Setup We analyze four representative MLLMs: (Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct two chat models and MiniCPM-o-2.6) and two reasoning models (GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3BThinking-2506). For each model, we compare internal behavior between safe and unsafe generations in multi-image and single-image settings using the full evaluation data and the same safety labeling as main experiments. To reduce promptor context-specific effects, we report attention-entropy differences averaged across instances in each condition (see the heatmap definition in Appendix E). We present heatmaps for Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking in the main text, and defer the left to Appendix F. We also confirm that safe and unsafe responses have similar average lengths (Appendix G), so entropy differences are not driven by length effects. Results Figure 4 shows, for each layer and answer segment, the head-averaged attention entropy difference between safe and unsafe responses. For both chat models, multi-image cases display large red regions across many layers, whereas singleimage cases with no clear structure. Thus, in multiimage reasoning, unsafe generations have lower attention entropy than safe ones on average, i.e., more concentrated attention, and this pattern does not appear in the single-image setting. For the two reasoning models, similar effect is concentrated in the early answer segments (roughly the chainof-thought), while single-image behavior again remains noisy. Overall, these correlations suggest possible internal vulnerability: when MLLMs operate near the limits of their ability on complex multi-image reasoning problems, they may overconcentrate attention on task solving and underallocate capacity to enforcing safety constraints."

            "content": "We introduce MIR-SafetyBench, the first safety benchmark designed for multi-image reasoning tasks. MIR-SafetyBench contains 2,676 instances covering 9 types of multi-image relations and 6 8 risk categories. Experiments on 19 representative MLLMs reveal extensive safety risks in multiimage reasoning. Beyond evaluating ASR, we further explore the internal mechanisms underlying multi-image safety by analyzing attention entropy. We hope MIR-SafetyBench can provide reliable evaluations on MLLMs multi-image safety, and inspire the discovery and mitigation of similar safety vulnerabilities arising from complex scenarios."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Benchmark coverage and construction MIRSafetyBench comprises 2,676 synthetic multiimage instances (24 generated images per case) covering 9 relation types and 6 predefined risk categories. This design offers broad but not exhaustive coverage of how multi-image reasoning can conceal harmful intent, and it inherits biases from the source safety datasets as well as from our automated seed-rewriting pipeline. Dependence on automatic components Our pipeline relies on specific automatic agents and including DeepSeek-R1 for rewritclassifiers, ing and evaluation, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the tester, FLUX.1-dev for image generation, and HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls for harmfulness judgments. Imperfections or biases in these components may introduce systematic noise into both the constructed instances and the safety labels, and our human review only spot-checks sampled examples rather than exhaustively validating the dataset. Evaluation setting and analysis scope Our evaluation focuses on fixed set of 19 popular MLLMs under single-turn prompting and uses classifierbased attack success rate as the primary safety metric. This setup does not capture interactive, multi-turn, or tool-augmented use cases, and our attention-entropy analysis covers only four representative models and provides correlational rather than causal evidence about the link between reasoning load and safety failures. Future work should extend MIR-SafetyBench to more realistic user interactions, additional modalities and relation types, and richer measurements of both internal states and real-world safety impact. Limited exploration of mitigation Our work is primarily diagnostic rather than prescriptive: we use MIR-SafetyBench and attention-entropy analysis to characterize vulnerabilities, but we do not train or adapt models using MIR-SafetyBench, nor do we propose concrete detection mechanisms, safety monitors, or training-time regularizers based on our findings. Bridging this gap from characterization to practical mitigation is an important direction for future work."

As result, some prompts and model outputs in our benchmark contain toxic or otherwise harmful content. Our intent is solely to enable systematic evaluation and analysis of safety vulnerabilities in MLLMs, and to support the development of more robust defenses; we do not encourage any realworld harmful behavior or deployment of unsafe systems. To mitigate these risks, we plan to conduct careful inspections before open-sourcing the benchmark, and restrict data access to individuals who adhere to stringent ethical guidelines. All human annotations in this work were conducted by members of the research team who were informed in advance that they might be exposed to harmful or disturbing content and about the intended research use of the data. Participation was voluntary, and annotators could discontinue at any time without penalty. We encouraged annotators to take breaks whenever needed and to avoid examples they found personally distressing. No personal identifying information about real individuals is included in MIR-SafetyBench, and all images are synthetically generated rather than collected from real users."

Attention-entropy heatmap for MiniCPM-o-2.6 and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 Figure 5 shows the heatmaps for MiniCPM-o-2.6 and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506, which support same conclusion with our experiment results. Statics for answer length. Our attention-entropy analysis focuses on long responses. For all models, we first filter out examples whose final answer is shorter than 1000 characters, so that trivial short or truncated generations are excluded. On the remaining data, we compare answer lengths between safe and unsafe subsets. Table 5 reports, for each model and for both single-image and multi-image settings, the mean number of generated tokens in the answer span used for entropy computation. Across all eight modelsetting combinations, safe and unsafe responses differ by at most about 20% in average length, and the direction of the difference is not consistent (e.g., unsafe answers are slightly shorter for Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and MiniCPM-o-2.6 in the multi-image setting). We observe similar patterns when measuring character lengths instead of tokens (not shown for brevity). These results indicate that the systematic entropy gaps in our attention-entropy heatmaps are unlikely to be explained solely by answer-length differences. Model Set.
