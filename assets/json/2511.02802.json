            "content": "Tabular data i.e. structured collections of records (rows) and attributes (columns)underpins vast array of real-world applications, from healthcare and finance to industrial analytics and scientific research. These datasets form the backbone of modern decision-making systems: hospitals rely on patient records for diagnostic risk prediction, financial institutions assess creditworthiness and fraud using structured features, and scientific studies aggregate multi-sensor measurements to discover new insights. Yet despite this ubiquity, deep learning on tabular data has long lagged behind the breakthroughs achieved in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Traditional approaches like gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost [1], LightGBM [2], CatBoost [3]) remain dominant because they reliably handle heterogeneous features, variable sample sizes, and small datasetschallenges that standard neural networks often struggle with. Deep models frequently underperform on tabular benchmarks due to the lack of spatial or temporal structure, making feature extraction less amenable to convolutional or sequential architectures. Moreover, tabular datasets often exhibit high heterogeneitymixing numerical, categorical, and ordinal variablesand suffer from missing values and skewed distributions, which violate many of the inductive biases that make deep learning successful in other modalities. As result, practitioners continue to favor tree ensembles and gradient boosting for their robustness, interpretability, and low data requirements. Recently, the advent of tabular foundation models (TFMs) has begun to reshape this landscape. These models extend the foundation model paradigmpretraining on large, diverse corpora followed by downstream adaptationto structured data domains. Models such as TABPFN [4, 5, 6], TABICL [7], CONTEXTTAB [8], ORIONMSP [9], and ORIONBIX [10] leverage large-scale pre-training on synthetic or massive tabular datasets to provide generic, TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models out-of-the-box learning capabilities. These developments mark significant step toward general-purpose tabular learners that can adapt rapidly to new datasets with minimal supervision. However, despite their promise, adopting these models in real-world practice remains hampered by several frictions: DIVERSE PREPROCESSING REQUIREMENTS: Each model demands its own data encoding, feature normalization, and missing-value strategyrequiring practitioners to build bespoke pipelines for each model family. For example, TabPFN expects numerically encoded categorical features consistent with its synthetic priors, whereas TabICL and Orion architectures rely on learned embeddings or set-transformer encoders for categorical attributes. FRAGMENTED APIS AND TRAINING PROTOCOLS: Some models operate purely in zero-shot inference mode (zero fine-tuning), others support supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see Section 2 for details). Managing these disparate workflows is laborious and error-prone, particularly when comparing multiple model families under consistent experimental settings. EVALUATION GAPS IN DEPLOYMENT-RELEVANT METRICS: While accuracy improvements are well documented, aspects such as calibration of probability estimates, fairness across subgroups, and resource-efficiency trade-offs are under-explored in unified framework. This absence of standardization makes it difficult to assess whether performance gains translate to trustworthy or deployable behavior. MODEL SELECTION COMPLEXITY: With multiple models and tuning strategies available, users face nontrivial questions: Which model best suits small vs. large dataset? What is the memory/latency trade-off? How do calibration and fairness behave under different tuning regimes? In practice, this uncertainty often discourages the adoption of TFMs despite their potential benefits. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TABTUNE, unified, scikit-learn-compatible toolkit that standardizes the full modelling workflow for tabular foundation models. TabTune offers: SINGLE INTERFACE for multiple TFM families, handling model-specific preprocessing internally and exposing consistent fitpredict semantics. Support for SPECTRUM OF ADAPTATION STRATEGIES: zero-shot inference, meta-learning, full supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This design allows practitioners to switch between inference paradigms seamlessly using unified API. Built-in diagnostics for CALIBRATION (Expected Calibration Error, Maximum Calibration Error, Brier score) and FAIRNESS (Statistical Parity Difference, Equalised Odds Difference, Equalised Opportunity Difference), enabling holistic assessment of model trustworthiness and risk. systematic benchmarking module across standard tabular suites (e.g., TALENT [11], OpenML-CC18 [12]) that evaluates accuracy, calibration, fairness, and resource efficiency in unified ranking framework, facilitating reproducible and comparative studies of TFM performance. With TabTune, practitioners can quickly experiment with multiple model/tuning configurations using consistent functions (e.g., .fit(), .predict(), .evaluate()), without rewriting preprocessing logic or training loops. Moreover, TabTune serves as an experimental bed for studying the interplay between learning paradigmssuch as zero-shot inference versus parameter-efficient tuningand their downstream effects on calibration, fairness, and computational efficiency. For detailed system architecture, see Section 3.2. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that TabTune not only simplifies workflows, but also provides new insights into the trade-off space of accuracy, calibration, fairness and efficiency across tabular foundation models. In the remainder of the paper, Section 2 reviews prior work on tabular foundation models and adaptation techniques. Section 3.2 details the system design of TabTune, Section 6 describes our experimental setup and benchmark results, and Section 7 offers practical guidance on model selection, discusses limitations, and outlines future directions."

            "content": "Tabular datastructured as records (rows) and features (columns)is pervasive across applications such as healthcare, finance, industrial analytics, and scientific research. For decades, models based on gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost have dominated supervised learning on tabular tasks. These methods reliably handle heterogeneous feature types, missing values, and small to medium sample sizes, while requiring 2 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models only modest hyper-parameter tuning. Their robustness and simplicity have made them the de facto standard for tabular prediction tasks in both research and production settings. In recent years, deep neural networkssuch as feed-forward multilayer perceptrons, attention-based architectures, and hybrid treeneural modelshave been applied to tabular data [13, 14]. Despite significant progress, these models have often struggled to consistently outperform GBDTs in real-world benchmarks. This gap arises from several challenges: the heterogeneity of tabular data, limited dataset sizes, complex featuretarget relationships, and the absence of large-scale pre-training strategies analogous to those that revolutionized vision and language modeling."

            "title": "2.2 Tabular Foundation Models",
            "content": "A major paradigm shift has recently emerged with the advent of tabular foundation models (TFMs)large pretrained architectures that aim to generalize across diverse tasks, often through in-context learning (ICL) or single forwardpass inference without task-specific gradient updates. In the context of TFMs, zero-shot inference refers to the \"fit then predict\" paradigm: during the fit phase, the model receives training samples as context (without gradient-based parameter updates), and during the predict phase, it performs in-context learning through forward passes alone to make predictions on test samples. Unlike traditional machine learning where \"fit\" implies gradient updates and training, in TFMs the fit step simply provides context samples to the pretrained model, enabling rapid adaptation without requiring training time. TABPFN (Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network) represents one of the earliest and most influential TFMs. It employs transformer architecture trained on vast collections of synthetic tabular datasets, effectively learning to approximate Bayesian inference across varying generative priors. This pre-training strategy enables TabPFN to achieve strong fewshot and zero-shot performance on small to medium datasets (typically up to 10,000 samples), offering competitive accuracy without explicit fine-tuning [4, 5, 6]. Building on this foundation, TABICL extends the in-context learning paradigm to larger-scale tabular datasets by introducing novel two-stage column-then-row attention mechanism. Through large-scale synthetic pre-training (up to 60K samples) and robust scaling to half million samples at inference time, TabICL demonstrates that transformer-based ICL can challenge traditional tree ensembles even on large tabular domains [7]. Another line of work, TABDPT, introduces an in-context learning (ICL)-based tabular foundation model trained with denoising-style, self-supervised objectives on real-world tables [15]. In parallel, other approaches explore the role of mixed synthetic priors, showing that combining causal, statistical, and randomized priors during pre-training can substantially improve downstream generalization and calibration performance across classification and regression tasks. Collectively, these developments illustrate that, with sufficient architectural bias and large-scale pre-training, transformerbased TFMs can achieve broad generalization on structured datachallenging long-held assumptions about the superiority of tree-based ensembles in tabular learning. Recent comprehensive surveys have catalogued the landscape of tabular foundation models [16, 17], highlighting their potential to transform tabular learning. Recent work has demonstrated that careful fine-tuning strategies can yield significant improvements for TFMs [18]. Meanwhile, researchers have argued that tabular foundation models should be research priority [19], given their potential impact across domains. ORIONMSP [9] introduces transformer architecture for tabular in-context learning that combines multi-scale sparse attentioncapturing both local and global feature dependencies efficientlywith Perceiver-style latent memory that enables safe bidirectional communication between training and test samples. It uses column-wise embeddings via Set Transformers to model feature distributions and split-masked causal attention mechanism for proper ICL reasoning. The design achieves near-linear attention scaling while maintaining high accuracy across diverse datasets, rivaling or outperforming TabICL and TabPFNespecially on heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and imbalanced datasetsthus demonstrating robust, efficient, and generalizable tabular learning without gradient updates. Similarly, ORIONBIX [10] employs biaxial attention mechanism for tabular in-context learning, enabling bidirectional context modeling across both rows and columns of tabular data. This dual-axis attention pattern allows the model to capture complex feature interactions and sample relationships simultaneously, providing more comprehensive representation of tabular structure. The biaxial design facilitates effective information flow between training and test samples, enabling strong in-context learning performance across diverse tabular datasets while maintaining computational efficiency."

AUTOGLUON [22] is an AutoML framework that automates model selection and hyperparameter tuning for tabular data, employing neural architecture search and ensemble methods to achieve strong predictive performance with minimal manual configuration. PYTORCH TABULAR [23] provides modular framework for deep learning with tabular data, offering reusable components for neural network architectures tailored to structured data. However, these frameworks primarily focus on training models from scratch or performing architecture search, rather than working with pretrained tabular foundation models. In contrast, TABTUNE is the first unified framework specifically designed for tabular foundation models, bridging the gap between pretrained TFM architectures and practical deployment workflows. While existing toolkits excel at discovering or building models from scratch, TabTune addresses the unique challenges of working with pretrained TFMs: standardizing diverse preprocessing requirements, unifying adaptation strategies (zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning), and providing built-in evaluation diagnostics for calibration and fairness. This specialization enables practitioners to leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of pretrained TFMs without the complexity of managing model-specific interfaces and workflows."

            "content": "Although inference-only TFMs exhibit strong generalization, many real-world applications benefit from adapting to target distributions. Three key adaptation paradigms have emerged. Meta-learning (or episodic fine-tuning) uses supportquery splits from training data to retain in-context generalization while improving task-specific performance [24]. This approach has proven effective for tabular foundation models such as TabICL, where episodic training enhances accuracy and supports few-shot adaptation to new distributions [7, 15]. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) updates all model parameters on labeled data when sufficient resources are available [25]. In tabular domains, full fine-tuning often yields notable gains over inference-only use, especially on large datasets where models learn domain-specific patterns [7, 15]. However, it remains computationally and storage intensive, as every parameter must be updated per task. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [26], limit updates to lowdimensional subspaces, greatly reducing compute and memory costs while preserving performance. Surveys categorize PEFT into additive (adapters), selective (partial updates), and reparameterization-based (low-rank) approaches [27]. Empirical studies show that PEFT matches or surpasses full fine-tuning with far lower resource demands [28]. For tabular foundation models, PEFT enables efficient domain adaptation under tight resource budgets, supporting rapid experimentation and scalable deployment. Together, these paradigms bridge the gap between zero-shot inference and fully supervised modeling, promoting adaptable TFMs for diverse applications."

Calibration reliabilitythe alignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomesis vital for highstakes decision-making. Guo et al. [29] showed that modern neural networks often exhibit systematic miscalibration, motivating metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) to measure these gaps. For tabular foundation models, early results suggest that pretrained transformers yield better-calibrated confidence estimates than classical ensembles, especially in low-data settings where in-context learning supports more nuanced uncertainty estimation. Fairness requires that models avoid systematic bias across demographic groups [30]. Fairness frameworks propose criteria such as equalized odds [31]requiring equal true and false positive ratesand equal opportunity, focusing on true positive rate parity. [32] revealed fundamental tension between perfect calibration and strict fairness, showing that these objectives can conflict. In-context learning setups may further amplify biases present in demonstration data. Mitigation strategies include group-balanced sampling, fair demonstration selection, and uncertainty-based data curation. 4 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models Figure 1 Overview of the TabTune architecture. Raw tabular data are processed through model-aware pre-processing engine and modular tuning pipeline, coordinated by central orchestration engine with integrated evaluation assessment modules. Robustnessthe stability of model behavior under distributional shift, perturbations, and adversarial attacksremains an open challenge. While tabular foundation models benefit from large-scale, heterogeneous pretraining, their behavior under shift and noise is not yet fully characterized. These considerations highlight the need for unified evaluation frameworks that jointly assess predictive performance, calibration, fairness, and robustness to ensure the responsible deployment of tabular foundation models."

Zero-shot inference, TabTune performs zero-shot prediction using pretrained weights, exploiting the generalization capacity of models such as TabPFN for small datasets without parameter updates. Supervised fine-tuning extends this by optimizing all model parameters through gradient-based learning on labeled data, allowing users to specify training details (e.g., number of epochs or learning rate) via the configuration dictionary. For in-context learning models such as TabICL and Mitra, batches are split into pseudo-episodes where the first half serves as support context and the second half as query targets, maintaining the episodic structure required by the model architecture. Meta-learning fine-tuning introduces episodic adaptation, where models are trained on dynamically sampled supportquery pairs to maintain in-context generalization while improving task-specific accuracy. Each episode randomly samples disjoint support and query sets from the training data, with class labels normalized to contiguous indices within each episode to ensure compatibility with fixed-size classification heads. This approach is particularly effective for transformer-based architectures like TabICL and TabDPT that rely on in-context reasoning. Parameter-Efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)implemented via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)reduces computational cost by updating only small low-rank matrices within attention layers. LoRA is configured with rank = 8 and scaling factor α = 16, injecting trainable adapters into attention projection layers. When LoRA application fails due to architectural constraints, the framework automatically falls back to standard fine-tuning.

Facilitating systematic comparison across broad spectrum of tabular learning settings. We further conduct DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EVALUATIONS in high-impact areas such as MEDICAL and FINANCIAL domains to assess the practical applicability of the methods. All experiments adhere to the STANDARDIZED DATASET SPLITS defined by each benchmark, ensuring both reproducibility and fairness in comparison. To maintain consistency and fairness across model families, benchmark results are computed only on the common subset of datasets available for all evaluated models within each benchmark suite. This unified evaluation protocol ensures that performance rankings and metrics reflect genuine methodological differences rather than disparities in dataset coverage. In total, our evaluations span 155/181 datasets for TALENT, 27/36 datasets for TabZilla, and 63/72 datasets for OpenML-CC18. Some datasets were excluded due to OUT-OF-MEMORY (OOM) ERRORS even on H200 GPUs or CUDA-RELATED ISSUES, particularly affecting TabPFN-based models. Models and Adaptation Strategies: We evaluate recent tabular foundation modelsTabPFN, TabICL, OrionMSP, including zero-shot OrionBiX, Mitra, ContextTab, and TabDPTunder multiple adaptation paradigms, inference, meta-learning fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient supervised fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient meta-learning. In addition, we include established traditional baselines using AutoGluon [22] such as XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest as strong reference models for comparison. Evaluation Metrics : Our assessment covers four complementary dimensions: PERFORMANCE: Classification Accuracy (ACC), AUC-ROC, and weighted F1-score (F1) quantify predictive capability across standard benchmark datasets (TALENT, OpenML-CC18, TabZilla) covering diverse dataset characteristics including small and large sample sizes, narrow and wide feature spaces, and balanced and imbalanced class distributions. It is important to clarify how MEAN RANK values are derived. Within each benchmark suite, models are ranked by accuracy on every dataset (lower rank = better performance), and these per-dataset ranks are averaged to obtain the overall mean rank. Thus, lower mean rank indicates stronger and more consistent performance across datasets, rather than the highest score on any single task. While absolute metrics (ACCURACY, F1) reflect peak task-level performance, mean rank provides normalized measure of cross-dataset generalization consistency. SCALABILITY: Analysis of performance variation across dataset sizes, feature dimensionality, and class imbalance provides practical guidance for model selection. This analysis uses the same benchmark datasets as performance evaluation, aggregated and summarized across these dimensions to reveal scalability patterns. CALIBRATION: We evaluate how fine-tuning impacts calibration metrics across different models and adaptation strategies, measuring the alignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, which is critical for decisionmaking systems. Our evaluation uses three metrics: (I) Expected Calibration Error (ECE), which measures the average 13 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models deviation between predicted confidence and observed accuracy across binned predictions; (II) Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), which captures the worst-case calibration gap, identifying regions of systematic miscalibration; and (III) Brier score, which quantifies both calibration and refinement by penalizing squared deviations between predicted probabilities and binary outcomes. FAIRNESS: We assess equitable treatment across demographic subgroups using established fairness-oriented datasets with sensitive attributes (gender, race). We measure three fairness criteria that capture different notions of equitable treatment: (I) Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) quantifies the absolute difference in positive prediction rates across groups, testing whether the model provides equal opportunity independent of sensitive attributes. model satisfies demographic parity when SPD approaches zero, indicating that positive predictions are distributed proportionally across demographic groups. (II) Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) measures disparities in both true positive and false positive rates across groups, ensuring consistent error profiles across subgroups. This criterion is more stringent than statistical parity, requiring not only proportional positive predictions but also equal accuracy within each group. (III) Equalized Opportunity Difference (EOpD) focuses specifically on true positive rate parity, ensuring that qualified individuals receive equal treatment regardless of group membership. This metric is particularly relevant in settings where false negatives have severe consequences, such as loan approvals or hiring decisions. Analysis Focus : central goal of our evaluation is to analyze how different adaptation strategieszero-shot inference, meta-learning fine-tuning, and supervised fine-tuningaffect model behavior across multiple dimensions. We examine whether fine-tuning improves performance, influences calibration, and impacts fairness across domains. This comparative analysis offers practical guidance on selecting appropriate adaptation strategies for tabular foundation models in different application contexts. Detailed dataset statistics and information refer to Appendix 10. All Experiments are executed on NVIDIA L40S (48Gb VRAM), with H200 (141Gb VRAM) used for memory-intensive cases. This ensures consistent execution across all experiments while handling the computational demands of models."

These results indicate that meta-learning offers the most balanced compromise between generalization and task-specific adaptation. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) : Full parameter fine-tuning yields divergent outcomes across architectures. TABPFN benefits most, achieving the best overall rank (1.97) and maintaining high accuracy across all benchmarks (ACC = 0.84590.8697, F1 = 0.83500.8617).

In the meta-learning configuration, ORIONMSP attains the best overall rank (2.21), recording (ACC = 0.7879/F1 = 0.7728) on TALENT, (0.8566/0.8453) on OpenML-CC18, and (0.8594/0.8581) on TabZilla. TABDPT follows closely (rank 2.28) with (0.8002/0.7910) on TALENT and (0.8600/0.8539) on OpenML-CC18.

TABPFN proves most resilient, achieving the top overall rank under SFT, whereas ORIONMSP demonstrates superior cross-dataset generalization in meta-learning. TABDPT delivers near-optimal performance under PEFT, offering the most favorable efficiencyaccuracy balance. Conversely, models such as TabICL and OrionBiX are highly sensitive to full parameter updates and prone to overfitting. Collectively, these observations establish that careful alignment between model architecture and adaptation strategy is critical for maximizing the performance of tabular foundation models. 15 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models Key Takeaways: OVERALL LEADERBOARD: Across all benchmark suites, the strongest overall performers are TABPFN and ORIONMSP. The TABPFN FAMILY (including TabPFN-2.0 and TabPFN-2.5) achieves the best aggregate results, with mean accuracies between 0.850.88 and weighted F1 scores of 0.840.88, reflecting exceptional cross-benchmark consistency. ORIONMSP follows closely (overall rank 4.61 in zero-shot and 2.26 in meta-learning), reaching ACC 0.840.88 and F1 0.830.88, with particularly strong generalization on OpenML-CC18 and TabZilla. ZERO-SHOT PERFORMANCE: The TABPFN family and ORIONMSP are the strongest zero-shot models. TABPFN-2.5 attains the best aggregate zero-shot rank (4.13), with ACC 0.850.88 across TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. ORIONMSP is close second (rank 4.61), matching TabPFNs accuracy on OpenML-CC18 and TabZilla while slightly trailing on TALENT. Both substantially outperform classical baselines by about 24 ACCURACY POINTS. SFT TRADE-OFFS: Full supervised fine-tuning benefits probabilistic architectures such as TABPFN, which achieves the highest accuracies (ACC 0.850.87, F1 0.830.86) across all benchmarks. In contrast, models such as TABICL and ORIONBIX exhibit severe degradation under SFT, reflecting overfitting and loss of pretrained priors. PEFT PERFORMANCE: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning attains nearfull-finetuning accuracy. TABDPT achieves top results (ACC 0.85, F1 0.84) and maintains strong stability across benchmarks, while ORIONMSP delivers competitive results (ACC 0.820.86, F1 0.800.85) with cross-dataset generalization."

These results confirm that episodic adaptation enhances calibration and minority-class reliability, while tree-based models lose 35% in accuracy under severe imbalance. Discussion : Scalability analysis underscores that TABPFN, ORIONMSP, and TABDPT each occupy distinct strengths. TABPFN excels on small, medium, and high-dimensional data where Bayesian priors and strong supervision prevail; ORIONMSP scales best with large datasets and imbalanced distributions due to meta-learning robustness; and TABDPT sustains near-top performance across all settings with minimal computational overhead. Classical baselines remain reliable but consistently trail the best TFMs by 24% in accuracy. Key Takeaways: DATASET SIZE: Small datasets favor the TABPFN FAMILY (TabPFN-2.5 zero-shot, TabPFN-2.0 metalearning), with TABDPT as close, efficient alternative; medium datasets favor TABPFN (meta & SFT); large datasets see XGBOOST slightly leading in raw accuracy, with ORIONMSP and TABDPT close behind. 17 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models Table 5 Performance variation by feature dimensionality (dataset width) across all benchmark suites.

TABDPT (PEFTSFT) also performs competitively (Rank = 1.96, ACC = 0.7680, F1 = 0.7531), achieving near-optimal results with reduced fine-tuning cost. In contrast, models such as TABICL and ORIONBIX lose up to 710 % accuracy under SFT, confirming overfitting risk in small, noisy clinical datasets. Traditional baselines (XGBOOST, LIGHTGBM) remain competitive (ACC 0.790.80) but trail the best TFMs by 23 . Overall, the medical results demonstrate that meta-learning TFMs generalize more reliably under limited data and high noise. Finance Domain Performance : Financial datasets are typically larger and more imbalanced, amplifying the value of episodic and parameter-efficient adaptation. ORIONMSP under meta-learning attains the best overall rank (2.26) and strong accuracy (ACC = 0.8209, F1 = 0.8089), narrowly surpassing TABPFN (meta, Rank = 3.00, ACC = 0.8220, F1 = 0.8056) and its SFT counterpart (Rank = 2.00, ACC = 0.8222, F1 = 0.8058). TABDPT (PEFTSFT) maintains competitive accuracy (Rank = 2.82, ACC = 0.7782, F1 = 0.7543), while ORIONMSP (PEFTSFT) achieves the strongest overall efficiencyaccuracy balance (Rank = 1.93, ACC = 0.7854, F1 = 0.7272). Transformer models such as TABICL degrade sharply under SFT (ACC drop > 12 %), whereas classical baselines remain robust (ACC 0.81) but underperform in F1 due to poor minority calibration. The finance domain thus emphasizes meta-learning as the most stable strategy for large-scale, imbalanced tabular data. Discussion : Across both domains, pretrained TFMs consistently outperform traditional baselines when appropriate fine-tuning strategies are used. TABPFN achieves the best reliability and calibration on small, noisy medical datasets, 19 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models Table 7 Domain-specific leaderboards for Medical and Finance datasets from the benchmark suites.

These trends highlight the need for strategydomain alignment: Bayesian priors excel under data scarcity, while meta-learning transformers scale better with complex, heterogeneous features. Key Takeaways: MEDICAL DOMAIN: TABPFN (SFT, rank 1.86) achieves best overall accuracy, with its meta-learning variant (rank 2.28) maintaining robustness; TABDPT (PEFTSFT, rank 1.96) offers strong low-cost alternatives. FINANCE DOMAIN: ORIONMSP (meta, rank 2.26, ACC 0.82) achieves top results, closely followed by TABPFN (meta/SFT, ranks 2.003.00); TABDPT (PEFTSFT) remains efficient and competitive. CROSS-DOMAIN: TABPFN provides most consistent cross-domain performance; ORIONMSP generalizes best to large-scale financial data; meta-learning and PEFT yield stable, domain-adaptive transfer."

We evaluate Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and Brier Score (BS) across all benchmark suitesTALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZillaunder different adaptation strategies. Lower values indicate better calibration. Table 8 summarizes the results and highlights how fine-tuning affects probabilistic reliability. Zero-shot inference Pretrained tabular foundation models (TFMs) achieve the strongest overall calibration without fine-tuning. ORIONMSP and TABICL obtain the lowest ECE (0.0219 on TALENT) and maintain low BS values ( 0.15). ORIONMSP further sustains excellent calibration on OpenML-CC18 (ECE=0.0319, BS=0.1262) and TabZilla (ECE=0.0310, BS=0.1243), ranking first or tied across suites. TABPFN-2.0 remains consistently well-calibrated (ECE=0.02760.0431, BS=0.1250.151), confirming the reliability of its Bayesian uncertainty modeling. TABDPT performs respectably (ECE0.030.04, BS0.120.16), while MITRA shows extreme miscalibration (ECE>0.19, BS>0.52), indicating unreliable confidence outputs. Meta-learning fine-tuning Episodic meta-learning largely preserves calibration quality. TABPFN achieves the best overall calibration across suites (ECE=0.02710.0388, BS=0.1180.150), improving slightly over zero-shot results. ORIONMSP remains competitive (ECE=0.03400.0520, BS=0.1250.166), maintaining stable confidence estimates even after adaptation. In contrast, transformer-heavy models such as TABICL exhibit severe degradation on TabZilla (ECE rises from TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models 0.0369 to 0.2033), showing that full episodic updates can destabilize latent priors when domain variability is high. Interestingly, MITRA improves calibration dramatically under meta-learning (ECE drops from 0.22 to 0.030.05), although its Brier scores remain poor (> 0.34), suggesting partial correction without overall reliability gains. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) Full SFT substantially worsens calibration for most transformer models. TABICLs ECE triples to quadruples (0.020.04 0.080.15) and its Brier Score deteriorates from 0.15 to 0.230.41. ORIONBIX follows similar pattern. ORIONMSP maintains moderate calibration (ECE=0.0470.077, BS=0.210.26)still degraded but markedly better than other transformers. TABPFN, however, preserves excellent reliability: across all suites, it records ECE=0.02870.0469, MCE<0.30, and BS=0.1240.158, closely matching or outperforming its zero-shot performance. TABDPT also retains good calibration (ECE=0.04970.0713, BS=0.1440.186). MITRA again performs worst (ECE > 0.15, BS > 0.47), underscoring structural limitations in its confidence estimation. Discussion : Calibration analysis reveals clear hierarchy of reliability. TABPFN consistently maintains AMONG THE LOWEST ECE and Brier scores across all adaptation strategies (ECE 0.0270.047, BS 0.120.16), validating its Bayesian design and robustness to parameter updates. Meta-learning preserves calibration better than full SFT, confirming that episodic adaptation reinforces pretrained uncertainty priors. ORIONMSP achieves strong calibration, especially under zero-shot and meta-learning, while transformer-centric models like TABICL and ORIONBIX show pronounced drift once fully fine-tuned. Overall, TFMs maintain lower calibration error than ensemble baselines and degrade far less under fine-tuning, making them more trustworthy for risk-sensitive deployment. Key Takeaways: TABPFN maintains excellent calibration across all strategies (ECE 0.0270.047, BS 0.120.15), confirming its Bayesian reliability; TABDPT (SFT) and ORIONMSP (zero-shot/meta-learning) rank next best (ECE 0.02190.0365). Supervised fine-tuning degrades calibration for transformer models: TABICLs ECE increases 34 and BS deteriorates sharply, while ORIONMSP degrades moderately. Zero-shot inference yields the best calibration overall, with ORIONMSP and TABPFN showing ECE < 0.04 across all suites."

            "content": "Fairness analysis evaluates whether model predictions exhibit systematic bias across demographic subgroups, complementing accuracy and calibration assessments by addressing equity in high-stakes applications such as lending, healthcare, and criminal justice. Unlike performance metrics that can be computed automatically, fairness requires explicit identification of sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender). We use datasets with demographic labelsAdult Census Income, German Credit, and COMPAS Recidivismto measure bias propagation and mitigation across strategies. Following standard fairness literature, we report Statistical Parity Difference (SPD), Equalized Odds Difference (EOD), and Equalized Opportunity Difference (EOpD). All metrics are absolute differences in the 01 range (lower = fairer). Table 9 summarizes fairnessaccuracy trade-offs across zero-shot, meta-learning, and fine-tuning strategies. Zero-shot inference. clear fairnessaccuracy trade-off emerges. MITRA achieves the lowest bias (SPD = 0.0193, EOD = 0.0590, EOpD = 0.0982) but with very low predictive accuracy (ACC = 0.6902). ORIONMSP and ORIONBIX balance fairness and accuracy best, maintaining high accuracy (ACC = 0.875-0.878) and moderate fairness (EOD = 0.270.28). TABPFN shows consistent behavior (ACC = 0.871, SPD = 0.307), while CONTEXTTAB ranks second in fairness (SPD = 0.208) at slightly lower accuracy. These results suggest that transformer-based models preserve competitive fairness even without task-specific adaptation. Meta-learning fine-tuning. Episodic adaptation largely preserves fairness while sustaining accuracy. ORIONBIX achieves the lowest overall bias (SPD = 0.2021, EOD = 0.1624, EOpD = 0.2010) while maintaining high accuracy (ACC = 0.8743). ORIONMSP follows closely (EOD = 0.2798, EOpD = 0.2907),a close second with slightly higher bias but similar accuracy.

Full SFT produces mixed fairness outcomes. MITRA again records the lowest bias (SPD = 0.0161, EOD = 0.0170) but with only ACC = 0.7268. TABICL exhibits striking fairness gains (SPD drops from 0.29 to 0.055) yet loses over 40% in accuracy (ACC = 0.4584). ORIONBIX improves fairness (EOD = 0.1761) but suffers large accuracy loss (ACC = 0.618). In contrast, TABPFN maintains both high accuracy (ACC = 0.8733) and moderate, stable fairness metrics across all strategies, confirming robustness. TABDPT ranks second in accuracy (ACC = 0.8529) with fairness levels comparable to TABPFN. These results underscore that SFT can reduce group disparity for some models but typically harms predictive reliability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). PEFT variants show similar patterns while retaining higher stability. Under PEFT meta-learning, ORIONBIX and ORIONMSP achieve balanced fairness (EOD 0.270.28) and strong accuracy (ACC = 0.8670.875), outperforming full SFT counterparts. Under PEFT SFT, MITRA again minimizes bias (SPD = 0.0029) but accuracy remains low (ACC = 0.7133). TABDPT delivers the best accuracyfairness compromise (ACC = 0.8595, SPD 0.30). Overall, PEFT preserves fairness trends while mitigating the accuracy collapse observed in full fine-tuning. Discussion. Fairness evaluation confirms fundamental accuracyequity trade-off. Models achieving near-perfect demographic parity (MITRA, SPD < 0.02) incur large accuracy losses, while TABPFN and ORIONMSP consistently achieve 23 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models balanced performance. Meta-learning proves most stable, preserving both fairness and accuracy across suites. SFT can occasionally improve parity for specific transformer architectures but typically at the expense of predictive fidelity. PEFT provides an effective compromise, maintaining high accuracy and moderate bias without significant fairness degradation. Key Takeaways: ACCURACYFAIRNESS TRADE-OFF: MITRA attains best fairness (SPD = 0.00290.0193) but suffers low accuracy (ACC = 0.690.73). BALANCED MODELS: TABPFN and ORIONMSP offer the best fairnessaccuracy equilibrium (ACC = 0.870.88, EOD = 0.270.29), outperforming other TFMs. EFFECT OF FINE-TUNING: SFT improves fairness for some models (e.g., TABICL SPD 0.055 vs 0.29 zero-shot) but drastically reduces accuracy; meta-learning preserves both aspects better. PEFT STABILITY: Parameter-efficient strategies maintain fairness trends while retaining high accuracy, offering pragmatic balance for equitable deployment."

            "content": "Fine-tuning strategy choice is critical and highly model-dependent. Zero-shot inference achieves excellent calibration (ECE <0.04 for top models) and competitive predictive performance. It is ideal when computational resources are limited or calibration reliability is priority. TABPFN-2.5 attains the highest overall zero-shot standing (Rank = 4.13), establishing new state-of-the-art for inference-only tabular tasks. ORIONMSP follows closely, achieving strong accuracy on large datasets (ACC = 0.87220.8821) and ranking among the top configurations on OpenML-CC18 and TabZilla without requiring additional training. Meta-learning fine-tuning provides the best balance between adaptation and generalization. It improves rank stability for models such as ORIONMSP (aggregate rank 2.26 in Table 3) while preserving calibration (ECE <0.06). Meta-learning also excels in high-imbalance settings (ORIONMSP rank 2.16, TABPFN rank 2.50 in Table 6), confirming its cross-domain robustness. However, instability can occur for some models such as TABICL on TabZilla (ECE increases to 0.2033), requiring careful validation. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) delivers the strongest results for TABPFN (ranks 1.831.89, ACC up to 0.9346 on wide datasets). In contrast, SFT causes substantial degradation for TABICL and ORIONBIX: for instance, TABICLs accuracy on TabZilla falls from 0.8734 to 0.5670, indicating severe overfitting. Calibration also deteriorates (ECE 0.080.15 vs. 0.020.04 zero-shot). SFT should therefore be used selectivelybeneficial for TABPFN, acceptable for TABDPT and ORIONMSP, but risky for TABICL and ORIONBIX. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) attains nearly full fine-tuning accuracy while greatly reducing computational cost. TABDPT achieves high performance (ACC 0.85, F1 0.84) across all benchmarks, and ORIONMSP maintains competitive accuracy (ACC 0.820.86, F1 0.800.85) with strong crossdataset generalization."

            "content": "The varying outcomes of different fine-tuning strategies can be explained by the underlying adaptation mechanisms. Why SFT Underperforms for TabICL and OrionBiX? Full supervised fine-tuning updates all model parameters, erasing pretrained representationsespecially detrimental on smaller datasets. The performance collapse of TABICL on TabZilla (ACC 0.8734 0.5670) exemplifies overfitting and representation drift, whereas optimization distorts pretrained priors. Both TABICL and ORIONBIX rely on high-capacity transformer layers optimized for diverse pretraining data; constraining them to narrow distribution leads to loss of generality and inflated variance in predictions. 24 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models Why Meta-Learning Preserves Generalization? Episodic training in ORIONMSP and TABPFN aligns closely with the few-shot adaptation process. Each metaepisode simulates the supportquery dynamics of deployment, encouraging transfer of cross-task features rather than memorization. This prevents catastrophic forgetting and reinforces pretrained inductive biases. The improvement in rank stability for ORIONMSP (from 2.903.84 in zero-shot to 1.732.82 in meta-learning) confirms that episodic optimization promotes stable generalization. When Fine-Tuning is Beneficial? Fine-tuning is most useful when: 1. Datasets are sufficiently large (>10K samples), mitigating overfitting. 2. Domain distribution shifts significantly from pretraining data (e.g., medical, finance). 3. Architecture maintains calibration under parameter updates (as in TABPFNs Bayesian prior design). For small or balanced datasets, zero-shot or meta-learning is more reliable and cost-efficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides strong middle ground, retaining 95% of full SFT accuracy while reducing memory."

Meta-learning further stabilizes calibrationTABPFNs ECE improves slightly under episodic updates, and ORIONMSP remains well-calibrated (ECE <0.06). In contrast, TABICL exhibits the largest degradation under SFT (ECE increases 34, BS rises to 0.230.41), confirming that full parameter updates distort uncertainty estimates.

            "title": "7.4 Model Selection Guidelines",
            "content": "Model selection should be guided by dataset scale, balance, feature dimensionality, and available computational resources. All recommendations below are derived from the common subset of datasets evaluated across all models to ensure consistent statistical comparison. Reported values combine mean accuracy (ACC), weighted F1-score (F1), and mean rank (based on accuracy) as presented in Tables 36. General Guidelines: When dataset characteristics are unknown, zero-shot inference with ORIONMSP or meta-learning fine-tuning with TABPFN serve as the most reliable defaults. Both models consistently achieve top-three average ranks across all benchmark suites while maintaining strong calibration and fairness. In general: TABPFN provides the most consistent accuracy and F1 across diverse data regimes, excelling in calibration and few-shot generalization. ORIONMSP scales best on large, complex, and imbalanced datasets, particularly under meta-learning. Specific Regime Recommendations. ON SMALL DATASETS (<1K SAMPLES), TABPFN-2.5 achieves the highest zero-shot performance (ACC = 0.8349, F1 = 0.8194), slightly ahead of TABDPT (0.8333/0.8271) and boosted-tree baselines. Under meta-learning, TABPFN-2.0 also leads (0.8336/0.8256), while ORIONMSP (PEFTMETA) provides strong performance at lower fine-tuning cost (0.8275/0.8213). Fine-tuning TABICL or ORIONBIX on small datasets still causes sharp degradation (ACC drops > 15%), revealing overfitting risk. MEDIUM DATASETS (1K10K SAMPLES): TABPFN with meta-learning achieves the highest mean accuracy (ACC = 0.8638, F1 = 0.8548, rank 2.0), followed closely by its supervised fine-tuning variant (ACC = 0.8580, F1 = 0.8485). When computational constraints are present, TABDPT (PEFTMeta) maintains competitive accuracy (ACC = 0.81210.8332) with minimal resource overhead. Zero-shot inference remains practical option for quick deployment, trailing fine-tuned variants by only about 23% in accuracy. LARGE DATASETS (>10K SAMPLES): ORIONMSP in zero-shot mode delivers the highest mean performance among TFMs (ACC = 0.8843, F1 = 0.8768, rank 2.0). TABDPT (zero-shot or PEFTSFT) achieves comparable accuracy (ACC = 0.84960.8831) while offering lower adaptation cost. Classical models such as XGBOOST and CATBOOST reach strong absolute accuracies (ACC = 0.8969, F1 = 0.8920) but 25 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models exhibit poorer calibration and higher cross-dataset variance. TFMs are therefore more advantageous when generalization consistency or uncertainty estimation is prioritized. BALANCED DATASETS: TABPFN under supervised fine-tuning yields the best average rank (1.96) with ACC = 0.8336, F1 = 0.8267, followed by ORIONMSP under meta-learning (rank 2.27). Balanced data favor Bayesian or episodically fine-tuned architectures, which maximize calibration and stability. IMBALANCED DATASETS: Meta-learning strategies provide the most robust adaptation under label imbalance. ORIONMSP achieves the best overall performance (rank = 2.16, ACC = 0.8735, F1 = 0.8636), with TABPFN ranking second (rank = 2.50, ACC = 0.8784, F1 = 0.8664). These results confirm that episodic training improves minority-class calibration. In contrast, tree-based baselines lose roughly 35% in F1 when class ratios fall below 0.6. LOW-TO-MEDIUM FEATURE DIMENSIONALITY (<100 FEATURES): Model performance converges across methods (ACC = 0.840.86), with TABPFN (Meta Learning) and ORIONMSP (Zero-Shot) performing most consistently. In this regime, TFMs primarily outperform classical methods in calibration and rank stability rather than raw accuracy. HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATASETS (>100 FEATURES): TABPFN under supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores (ACC = 0.9346, F1 = 0.9335), significantly surpassing other models. TABDPT and ORIONMSP maintain strong accuracy (ACC 0.840.89) while offering superior efficiency. Architectures such as TABICL and ORIONBIX exhibit sharp performance drops under full fine-tuning, confirming their susceptibility to overfitting in wide-feature settings."

TABDPT under PEFTSFT (Rank = 1.96) provides competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. Transformer-based architectures such as TABICL and ORIONBIX exhibit notable degradation under full fine-tuning, reflecting sensitivity to small and noisy clinical datasets. Overall, Bayesian and episodically trained models generalize more reliably in data-scarce medical settings. FINANCE DOMAIN: ORIONMSP under meta-learning achieves strong results (Rank = 2.26, ACC = 0.8209, F1 = 0.8089), while TABPFN performs exceptionally well in supervised and meta-learning modes (Ranks = 2.003.00, ACC = 0.82200.8222). TABDPT remains competitive (PEFTSFT, Rank = 2.82) and offers an efficient alternative with only minor loss in accuracy.

Across comparable settings, TFMs achieve mean accuracies around 0.850.88 versus 0.830.86 for boosted trees. However, their primary advantage lies in reliability and robustness rather than raw accuracy. Key strengths include: (I) ZERO-SHOT ADAPTABILITY: The TABPFN family and ORIONMSP provide top-tier zero-shot performance. TABPFN-2.5 attains the best aggregate zero-shot rank (4.13) with ACC 0.850.88, while ORIONMSP remains highly competitive (rank 4.61, ACC = 0.84550.8821). Both outperform boosted-tree baselines by roughly 1.52.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS in accuracy without any task-specific training. (II) CALIBRATION: TABPFN maintains low calibration error (ECE < 0.05) across both zero-shot and fine-tuned regimes, outperforming ensemble baselines whose ECE often exceeds 0.08. (III) FAIRNESS STABILITY: TFMs achieve moderate statistical parity differences (SPD 0.280.30) while sustaining high accuracy (> 0.85), indicating balanced performance across sensitive groups. 26 TabTune: Unified Library for Inference and Fine-Tuning Tabular Foundation Models Consequently, TFMs should be regarded as reliable, general-purpose learners well suited for rapid deployment, few-shot adaptation, and risk-sensitive applications where calibration and fairness are critical. For large, well-labeled, single-domain problems, gradient-boosted trees may still be preferable for simplicity and computational efficiency, but TFMs offer distinct advantages in uncertainty estimation, cross-domain generalization, and calibration consistency."

DIMENSIONALITY: All models can degrade when the feature space exceeds 1000 dimensions without preprocessing or feature selection. PEFT COMPATIBILITY: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning is fully supported for ORIONMSP and TABDPT, but only partially implemented for TABPFN and CONTEXTTAB. CONTEXTTAB EVALUATION: Due to excessive GPU memory requirements, CONTEXTTAB was evaluated only on smaller benchmark subsets.

By abstracting model-specific preprocessing, consolidating adaptation strategies, and integrating evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness, TABTUNE addresses the fragmentation that has limited the broader adoption of TFMs. Inspired by AUTOML, TABTUNE focuses on managing and optimizing pretrained TFMs rather than building models from scratch, offering coherent framework for efficient adaptation and assessment. We conducted comprehensive study on the performance of tabular foundation models (TFMs) and the impact of fine-tuning strategies on their effectiveness. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the choice of adaptation strategy is highly model-dependent. TABPFN performs optimally under supervised fine-tuning or meta-learning, ORIONMSP exhibits strong generalization and robustness particularly with meta-learning, and TABDPT using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) achieves favorable balance between predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Beyond raw performance, our findings emphasize the reliability and fairness of TFMs. TABPFN consistently attains excellent calibration, while both ORIONMSP and TABPFN maintain strong fairnessaccuracy balance, reinforcing their potential for responsible and trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains."

The model is trained using episodic data sampling, where each episode consists of support set (context) and query set (target predictions).

Key Characteristics: Training Paradigm: Episodic learning with support-query splits Episode Structure: Each training step samples support and query sets from the target dataset Objective: Learn to make accurate predictions on query sets given support set context Use Cases: Ideal for small to medium datasets (<10K samples), maintains generalization to new tasks Advantages: Better generalization, mimics actual inference scenarios for in-context learning models Considerations: Requires careful episode sampling, support/query size tuning, more epochs needed General Hyperparameter Guidelines: Learning Rate: Typically lower than SFT (2e-6 to 1e-5) to preserve pretrained representations Support Size: 32-512 samples per episode, depending on dataset size and model architecture Query Size: Usually 20-50% of support size, determines episode difficulty Episodes per Epoch: 100-1000 episodes ensure diverse task exposure Epochs: 3-5 epochs often sufficient due to episodic diversity Batch Size: 1-8 episodes per batch for memory-efficient training Episode Filtering: Episodes where query classes are absent from the support set are automatically filtered to maintain class consistency.

For linear layer with weight matrix Rmn, LoRA adds trainable matrices Rmr and Rrn where min(m, n) is the rank. The forward pass becomes: = + α (BA)x where α is scaling factor and BA is the low-rank update. Only and are updated during training, while remains frozen.

Expected Calibration Error (ECE) Average deviation between predicted confidence and observed accuracy across binned predictions; lower values indicate better calibration alignment (see Section 6). Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that adds trainable low-rank matrices to approximate full weight updates; only adapter matrices are updated, base weights remain frozen (see Section 2). Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) Worst-case calibration gap across all prediction bins; identifies regions of systematic miscalibration and extreme confidence misalignment (see Section 6). Meta-Learning (Episodic FineTuning) Training strategy using support-query splits that mimics inference-time environment; preserves in-context generalization while enabling task-specific adaptation (see Section 2). Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PEFT) FineAdaptation methods that update only subset of model parameters, reducing computational costs by 6080% while preserving performance; includes LoRA and similar techniques (see Section 2). Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) Absolute difference in positive prediction rates across demographic groups; tests demographic parity, where zero indicates perfect parity in prediction distribution (see Section 6). Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Zero-Shot Inference Full parameter updates on labeled data using standard gradient descent; updates all model parameters, computationally intensive but can achieve highest taskspecific accuracy (see Section 2). Prediction using pretrained model weights without parameter updates; models receive training samples as context during inference, performing in-context learning through forward passes alone (see Section 2)."
