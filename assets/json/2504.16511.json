            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The efficiency and preference of pretraining large language models are significantly influenced by the characteristics of the training corpus (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Longpre et al., 2024). There is evidence from existing research 1 suggesting that the model performance can be improved through the curation of high-quality data (Wettig et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2023b; Sachdeva et al., 2024), the application of data deduplication and diversification strategies (Abbas et al., 2023; Tirumala et al., 2023), and the careful balancing of data distribution across various domains and topics (Liu et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2023a). Nevertheless, identifying optimal configuration of combining those factors remains an open challenge, due to complex interplay between data quality and diversity, which has yet to be fully understood. There remains two major challenges to identify the optimal data selection strategy. Firstly, the definition of quality and diversity is ambiguous. Previous research has proposed various definitions of quality criteria, including factors such as regular expression (Penedo et al., 2023; Wenzek et al., 2020), educational value (Penedo et al., 2024), similarity to instruction tuning data (Li et al., 2024), etc, each emphasizing only specific aspect of the data. On the other hand, approaches like (Liu et al., 2024; Abbas et al., 2023) optimize the data mixtures for more effective training, indicating that better diversity is not necessarily uniform distribution. Secondly, there exists interplay between data quality and diversity. The choice of quality criteria affects the distribution of selected data as illustrated in Figure 1, due to inherent biases in different criteria. Meanwhile, changing of data mixtures influences the data quality, as the quality level differs across different domains. Also, since the high quality data is limited, the trade-off between better quality or diversity is inevitable, which is not feasible by optimizing only for data quality or diversity. How to jointly optimize the data distribution together with the selection of quality criteria remains another unsolved issue. To address these challenges, we propose unified data selection framework, QuaDMix, which simultaneously manages data quality and diversity. rameters. The optimal parameter configuration is then determined by searching the input space of trained LightGBM regressor(Ke et al., 2017). We then evaluate different pretraining data selection methods on models with 530M parameters. The optimal configuration identified by QuaDMix achieves superior performance on an aggregated benchmark. Our results also reveal the following insights: (1) Different quality criteria exhibit tradeoffs across downstream tasks, but appropriately merging these criteria yields consistent improvements across tasks by leveraging complementary information. (2) The optimal data mixture varies under different quality criteria, indicating the importance of jointly optimizing both the quality and diversity. (3) The target of regression model can guide the preference for specific downstream tasks, enabling task-focused data selection."

            "title": "2.1 Pretraining Data Selection",
            "content": "Data quality, diversity, and coverage are critical factors for ensuring the efficiency and generalizability of large language models (Cheng et al., 2024; Touvron et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2023). To improve data quality, rule-based filtering techniques are commonly employed (Laurençon et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2024; Penedo et al., 2023; Raffel et al., 2020). These methods use handcrafted heuristics, such as removing terminal marks, detecting sentence repetitions, and enforcing length constraints, to exclude low-quality data. While these rules effectively filter out noisy data from the training corpus, they fail to capture semanticlevel information, which is crucial for more refined data selection. Alternative approaches aim to address this limitation. For instance, (Wenzek et al., 2020; Marion et al., 2023; Thrush et al., 2024) use model perplexity as measure of data quality, while (Lin et al., 2025) apply token-level selection by reweighting the loss across tokens. (Xie et al., 2023b) utilize n-gram features to quantify data importance and sample accordingly. Discriminator-based methods (Brown et al., 2020; Du et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2020; Soldaini et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024) select data by comparing it to predefined high-quality datasets, such as Wikipedia or instruction-tuning datasets. However, how much these predefined datasets represent for high-quality relies on empirical judgement. More recently, approaches like (Gunasekar et al., 2023; Sachdeva et al., 2024; WetFigure 1: The distribution change of data selected with Fineweb-edu Classifier. With the top5% documents selected, the ratio of certain domains including Health, Jobs and Education, increases for large margin compared with original data Firstly, we apply several quality scorers and domain classification on each document in the training corpus, to measure the data quality and diversity. Then parameterized function is designed to determine the sampling frequency for each document based on those quality and domain labels. Specifically, an aggregated quality score is first computed by weighted averaging the quality scores, where the weights are controlled by adjustable parameters. Then parameterized sampling function takes the aggregated quality score as input and calculate the sampling frequency, where data with higher quality is assigned with more frequency and the parameters affect how the frequency decreases as the quality diminishes. Here we take the assumption that training samples with higher quality worth sampled for more times. We assign independent parameters for data across different domains to control the diversity via parameters. To find the optimal parameters among the numerous parameter space, we employ two-step approach inspired by (Liu et al., 2024). First, we train set of small models on datasets sampled using QuaDMix with various parameter configurations, as an approximation for the performance of larger models. Next, we train regression model to fit the performance results from this limited set of small models. This regression model is then used to predict the performance for unseen parameter configurations, providing an efficient way to explore the parameter space without exhaustive large-scale training. To validate the effectiveness of QuaDMix, we train 3000 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens, each using data sampled from RefinedWeb (Penedo et al., 2023) with various QuaDMix paFigure 2: The overall design of QuaDMix. First we extract the data features using classifier and quality scores (QS). Then we calculate quality rank for each domain with the merging parameters. Finally the sampling functions controlled by sampling parameters are applied to generate the final output data. tig et al., 2024; Penedo et al., 2024) leverage large language models (e.g., GPT-4) to evaluate and filter data based on designed prompts that emphasize various dimensions of value, offering more nuanced way to define and curate high-quality data. To optimize data distribution, various methods leverage clustering and representativeness to achieve deduplication and diversification. For example, (Abbas et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024; Tirumala et al., 2023) employ data clustering techniques to identify and select representative data points, ensuring both diversity and efficiency in the training corpus. Other approaches estimate optimal data mixtures through iterative modeling. (Xie et al., 2023a) first train small reference model and subsequently optimize the worst-case loss across domains by training proxy model to identify the optimal data mixture. Similarly, (Bai et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024) calculate influence scores by tracking first-order gradients on an evaluation set, thereby identifying the most valuable data for training. Additionally, (Liu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024) simulate the performance of different data mixtures by training series of proxy models, enabling the prediction of large-model performance with low compute cost."

            "content": "Neural Scaling Laws have been shown to effectively predict performance across varying training budgets, model sizes, and dataset scales in LLM pretraining (Kaplan et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2022). However, in practical scenarios where dataset size is limited, or data mixtures vary, scaling laws exhibit significant variations (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Several studies have extended scaling laws to account for these complexities. (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Hernandez et al., 2022) explore the impact of data repetition levels on scaling behaviors, while (Ge et al., 2024) investigate scaling dynamics under different domain proportions and dataset sizes. To optimize data compositions, (Liu et al., 2024) propose regression model for predicting optimal mixtures, and (Kang et al., 2024) further analyze optimal compositions across varying scales. Additionally, (Que et al., 2024) focus on identifying the best data mixtures for the continued pretraining stage, providing insights into refining pretraining strategies under diverse constraints."

            "content": "Our approach can be illustrated in 4 parts: 1) We propose the QuaDMix framework, which utilizes unified parameterized function to govern the data sampling process. 2) We conduct small-scale experiments to explore how different parameter settings within QuaDMix affect the performance of LLM. 3) We train regression model to capture these effects, using it to identify the optimal parameters. 4) With the optimal parameter settings, we sample large-scale data and train large language model. 3 3.1 Design of QuaDMix We design QuaDMix as sampling algorithm that simultaneously accounts for data quality and diversity, as shown in Figure 2. Given pretraining dataset X, we define sampling function S(x, qx, dx; θ), which determines the expected sampling times of each data point based on its data feature qx and dx. Here qx represents the quality score vector, which includes multiple quality criteria, and dx denotes the domain to which belongs. θ are the parameters to be optimized. The output of this function is fractional value, e.g. a.b, meaning the document will be sampled for times plus another random sampling with probability b. Feature Extraction To measure samples contribution to diversity and its quality, we propose using domain classification and quality scorers to label the pretraining data. Specifically, we use domain classifier to divide the dataset into domains, where will be assigned domain label dx. Then we use quality scorers to compute the quality vector qx = (q1,x, ..., qN,x), and for each qn,x, smaller value indicates better quality on that dimension. For the sake of simplicity, we omit in the subscript in the following discussion. Quality Ranking We first define merging function that integrates the scores from various quality filters, aiming to incorporate complementary information provided by different criteria. Assuming there are criteria, for any individual example belonging to domain m, the merged quality score is calculated by = (cid:88) n=1 σ(qn)αn,m, (1) where αm are the merging parameters for domain m. We utilize separate merging parameters to balance the quality criteria across different domains, as the criteria exhibit varying preferences depending on the domain. σ is normalization function to align the scales of quality criteria. We then sort the data based on the merged quality score. The sorting is operated separately in each domain. The merged quality rank is calculated by computing the percentile of the data within that domain. That is = {xdx = m, qx <= q} {xdx = m} . (2)"

(Note that we use smaller quality scores to represent higher quality.) Quality Sampling Next, we define the sampling function. We take the assumption that higherquality data should be sampled more frequently in the final dataset. This assumption is supported by evidence (Penedo et al., 2024), which demonstrates that applying higher quality threshold improves downstream performance. For any example in domain with merged quality rank r, the value of the sampling function is determined by S(r) = (cid:26) ( 2 1+eλm(ωmr) )ηm + ϵm, <= ωm > ωm ϵm, (3) We denote βm = (λm, ωm, ηm, ϵm) as the sampling parameters for domain m. We use format of sigmoid to ensure the sampling value is monotonically decreasing as the quality rank goes up (worse quality) and λm is used to adjust how fast it decreases. ωm controls the quality percentile threshold, determining the minimum quality level we aim to retain. ηm is scaling parameter that adjusts the sampling values, while ϵm introduces randomness to incorporate data from all quality ranges. By applying different sampling parameters across domains, we achieve flexible control over domain proportions. In summary, by integrating (1),(2), and (3), we define the sampling function for individual domain m, with the parameters structured as θm = (αm, βm). The total number of parameters is (N + 4) , where represents the number of used quality criteria and denotes the total number of distinct domains."

Following this, series of small proxy models are trained on each dataset and evaluated on the validation set to compute the validation loss. Parameter Sampling The parameter space requires careful design to encompass valuable regions, while avoiding extreme conditions. We sample from the parameter space as following: 4 Algorithm 1 Parameter Sampling for QuaDMix Ensure: θ Require: N, Sample (a1, ..., aN ) (0, 1) an = an(cid:80) ai for = 1 to do Sample (b1,m, ..., bN,m) (0, 1) bn,m = anbn,m (cid:80) aibi,m αm = (bn,m), = 1, ..., Sample (λm, ωm, ηm, ϵm) (0, 1) λm = 103λm, ωm = 0.1ωm ηm = ηm, ϵm = ϵm/1000 βm = (λm, ωm, ηm, ϵm) θm = (αm, βm) end for θ = (θ1, ..., θM ) In the algorithm above, we introduce global weight for each quality criteria, with the final weight computed by multiplying the global weight by the domain-specific weight. Without this global weight, the expected average weight across domains for each quality criterion would always be 1/N , which fails to account for the scenario where one quality criterion may suppress another overall. For βm, we rescale them accordingly to ensure domain proportions and quality thresholds remain within reasonable range. Using this process, we generate 3,000 sets of parameters θi and then sample with QuaDMix from our training data, producing 3,000 proxy datasets, denoting as Di.

Optimal Parameter Estimation Once the regressor is trained, we search the input space to find the optimal parameters that minimize the predicted loss. Rather than performing random search across the entire space, we sample 100,000 data points using the algorithm outlined in Section 3.2 to mitigate the influence of outliers on the regressor. To further reduce the variance in the regression predictions, we sort the data points based on their predicted target values and calculate the average of the top 10 data points to determine the final output. 3.4 Large-scale Model Experiments We then use the optimal parameters to generate large-scale datasets for training large-scale models. In practice, since sorting the quality scores across the entire dataset is computationally expensive, we estimate the quality percentile by randomly selecting subset of 10,000 documents. Within this subset, we calculate the mapping between the quality percentile and quality score, and then apply this mapping to the entire dataset."

More Tokens not always good We also experiment with selecting more tokens by loosing the sampling parameter ω in QuaDMix. In that way we introduce more diversed tokens but lower quality into the training. The results in Table 2 show that selecting 30B tokens, i.e. documents with top5% quality yields the best result, meaning that curing data quality contributes more than increasing the number of unique tokens within this range. Proxy Ability of Small Models How well the prediction loss on proxy models forecasts the performance on large-scale models is the key factor of QuaDMix. To study this, we train 5 separate regression models, each using the loss on training set of one benchmark as the target. The results on the validation set are shown as blue points in Figure 5. We notice that HellaSwag has larger variance than others, which indicates there may be more influencing factors related with HellaSwag, making the loss on it harder to predict. Then we predict the loss for optimal parameters from QuaDMix-OH and QuaDMix-BMK using each regression model as shown in Figure 5. It is reasonable to see the loss of QuaDMix-BMK surpasses QuaDMix-OH on all tasks since QuaDMix-BMK utilizes benchmark training set as optimizing target. Finally we report the performance of large model in Table 3. Except for HellaSwag, QuaDMix-BMK outperforms QuaDMix-OH on other tasks, which agrees with the trend on prediction loss. The inconsistent conclusion on HellaSwag is because the predict loss has larger variance as mentioned above, making the proxy ability lower than other tasks. How to further increase the proxy ability is one of the future direction to explore."

            "content": "In this paper, we propose novel data selection method QuaDMix that jointly optimizes the data quality and diversity for language model pretraining. We design parameterized space that controls both the data quality and diversity, and conduct proxy experiments to find the correlation between the parameter and model performance. The training data generated with optimal parameters are proved to outperform others on various downstream tasks."

            "title": "8 Limitations",
            "content": "We note several limitations of our work. There exist improvement space for the design of parameter space of QuaDMix. For example the parameters of sampling function may generate similar functions under different parameters, which will cause redundancy and introduce uncertainty into the regression model. Secondly, the searching in the parameter space for optimal parameters is inefficient. We use random guessing in space with 200 more dimensions, for certain the current optimal parameter is local minimum and how to effectively search in the parameter space remains unclear. Finally, the proxy ability of small models is crucial, what is the systematic way to improve it is an important yet less explored topic. However, QuaDMix provides useful solution for jointly optimize for data quality and diversity, and it worth continually exploring on the limitations mentioned above."
