            "content": "Spatial reasoning plays crucial role in bridging visual observation to robotic action [43, 88, 89], autonomous driving, and AR/VR. For models to execute tasks effectively, they must understand spatial relationships to determine appropriate actions. To enhance the spatial understanding of VisionLanguage Models (VLMs), prior works [15, 17, 11, 68, 102, 123, 121, 89] have integrated spatial information into datasets, enabling basic forms of spatial reasoning. Various benchmarks [26, 104, 101, 48, 34, 102, 121, 89] have been introduced to systematically evaluate such capabilities, focusing on tasks like recognizing left and right, estimating depth, and constructing cognitive maps [121, 106, 72]. Additionally, spatial reasoning has been applied to manipulation tasks [25, 8, 131, 20, 123], allowing systems to position objects according to specified spatial rules [89]. Despite these advances, existing approaches largely focus on basic spatial understanding, which typically includes identifying simple spatial relations such as relative positions (left, right, front, back), proximity (near, far), and object-level counting. Recent models, including state-of-the-art reasoning systems like ChatGPT o3 [79] and Gemini-2.5-Pro [97], have achieved over 90% accuracy on benchmarks such as SpatialBot-Bench [11] and EmbSpatial [26], suggesting that these basic tasks are approaching saturation, as shown in Fig. 1. However, complex spatial reasoning remains significant challenge [35, 5, 83, 50, 82, 16]. Human interaction with the physical world often involves interpreting ambiguous, dynamic, and contextdependent spatial relationships [7, 109, 95]. For example, in an emergency, knowing that an AED is to the right of the door is insufficient without understanding schematic diagrams, correlating maps with real-world environments, and planning an efficient route. Similarly, tasks like inserting knife into rack or flattening box demand reasoning about object rotation, deformation, and spatial compatibilityfar beyond static object placement. From the perspective of cognitive psychology, complex spatial reasoning extends beyond basic relations and includes dynamic world knowledge reasoning, interactive spatial behavior with environments or agents, logical analysis of 3D spatial structures, and perspective-taking abilities. Therefore, to address these limitations and systematically assess higher-order spatial reasoning, we propose OmniSpatial, comprehensive benchmark capturing the breadth and depth of spatial cognition. OmniSpatial categorizes spatial reasoning into four key dimensions: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, providing foundation for advancing the next generation of spatially-aware & physics-aware AI systems.

The OmniSpatial benchmark includes images or video frames across diverse scenes, resolutions, lighting conditions, and weather patterns, collected from multiple countries across different continents. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs on our benchmark. Our findings indicate that, while current models perform well on conventional benchmarks, OmniSpatial presents significantly greater challenge due to its comprehensive and complex task design. Our key contributions are as follows: 2 We categorize visual-spatial reasoning into four key dimensionsdynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-takingbroadening the scope of evaluation and guiding future research on spatial cognition in embodied & physics intelligence. We develop the OmniSpatial dataset, which offers diverse and challenging set of spatial tasks, serving as comprehensive benchmark for assessing VLMs spatial reasoning capabilities. We explore the enhancement of spatial reasoning in VLMs by incorporating auxiliary models in chain-of-thought manner, demonstrating improved reasoning performance through this approach."

            "title": "2 Preliminaries: Visual–Spatial Reasoning",
            "content": "Spatial reasoning constitutes the cognitive bridge between visual perception and action planning in embodied agents. We define visualspatial reasoning as the capacity of an artificial system to infer, predict, and manipulate spatial properties of the world from visual observations. Formally, let an RGB observation stream be I1:T and task-specific query be q. model possesses visualspatial reasoning if it can learn mapping : (I1:T , q) a, where belongs to well-defined action or answer space whose correctness can be verified in the physical or simulated environment. This definition excludes non-visual priors so that improvements can be attributed to visual reasoning itself, yet it remains compatible with multi-modal extensions discussed in 1. 2.1 Taxonomy of VisualSpatial Reasoning Figure 2: Benchmark Statistics of OmniSpatial: The distribution of tasks across 4 main categories. Our classification stems from two complementary motivations. (i) Cognitive-psychology foundations. Decades of research on spatial cognition isolate partly independent facultiese.g., spatial visualization, mental rotation, perspective taking, and spatial updatingthat can be psychometrically evaluated in humans [13, 71]. These constructs offer principled scaffold for analysing how agents perceive, reason about, and act within space. (ii) The need to move beyond basic spatial relations. Current spatial benchmarks are nearly saturated on tasks such as leftright discrimination, frontback identification, and object counting [15, 11, 17, 26, 104]. Real-world embodied tasks, however, require richer reasoning [50, 82, 16, 103, 53] about scene dynamics, multi-step spatial logic, physically grounded interaction, and viewpoint transformation. Guided by these two strands, we partition spatial reasoning into four orthogonal yet complementary dimensionsdynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective taking. Each dimension aligns with specific cognitive faculty and targets distinct class of spatial challenges that is under-represented in prior work, enabling us to construct benchmarks that probe the full spectrum of complex spatial cognition while remaining anchored in established psychological theory. Dynamic Reasoning involves predicting motion and temporal changes in spatial environments. This capability is crucial for tasks such as robotic control and autonomous navigation, where anticipating object trajectories ensures adaptive decision-making in dynamic contexts. Complex Spatial Logic encompasses high-level reasoning about spatial relationships, transformations, and geometric structures. It is fundamental to problem-solving in domains such as engineering, design, and robotic manipulation, where understanding spatial configurations and predicting structural changes are essential. Spatial Interaction focuses on engagement with spatial environments, where reasoning is guided by environmental constraints and task objectives. This includes applications such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, and real-time decision-making based on spatial feedback. 3 Figure 3: Tasks Demonstration of OmniSpatial. Several representative subtasks are selected for demonstration in each of the four task categories. Note: The questions above are slightly simplified for clarity and conciseness. Perspective Taking refers to the ability to adopt different viewpoints, which is crucial for navigation, social cognition, and spatial awareness. It allows for understanding spatial relationships from multiple perspectives, facilitating decision-making in multi-agent environments and adaptive problem-solving. 2.2 Rationale for Classification This taxonomy is designed to be both theoretically comprehensive and practically applicable. Dynamic reasoning emphasizes motion prediction, which is critical for navigation and interaction. Complex spatial logic provides foundation for advanced cognitive tasks involving transformation and abstraction. Spatial interaction highlights real-time engagement with environments, while perspective taking captures cognitive flexibility in spatial reasoning. By structuring visual-spatial reasoning in this manner, we establish framework that enhances the evaluation of spatial cognition models and their applications in artificial intelligence, robotics, and human cognition research."

            "content": "3.1 Overview We introduce OmniSpatial, benchmark for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in visual-spatial reasoning. Unlike large-scale benchmarks focused on few tasks, OmniSpatial prioritizes task diversity and structured categorization over sheer dataset size. It consists of 1533 high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to challenge models beyond simple pattern matching or statistical learning, ensuring that spatial reasoning capabilities are tested rigorously, even with limited data. Our dataset is curated from web searches, standardized tests, driving exam questions, and existing datasets including MME [57], HOI4D [67], etc.This diverse sourcing enhances the realism, complexity, and cross-domain generalization of the tasks. Web-sourced images cover natural environments, architecture, and daily life, adding visual complexity. Standardized tests from psychology and cognitive science provide scientifically rigorous spatial reasoning challenges. Driving exam questions introduce real-world dynamic interactions, such as road rule comprehension and motion prediction. Additionally, datasets like HOI4D contribute multi-resolution, varying illumination, and viewpoint diversity, as well as embodied intelligence tasks involving human-object interactions. 4 Figure 4: Data Construction of OmniSpatial.The pipeline collects images from multiple sources and ensures their quality and relevance through manual selection. Precise annotations are then applied, ensuring each question has clear, unique answer while maintaining natural, conversational expression. This process supports the effective training of VLMs in spatial reasoning tasks. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we categorize tasks into 4 major spatial reasoning types, further divided into 50 fine-grained task categories, as shown in Figs. 3 and 7. For example, perspectivetaking tasks range from simple spatial judgments (Is the opponents weapon to the left or right of the blue athlete?) to complex motion prediction (The blue athlete is blocking an incoming attack from the red athletewhat will happen next?). Spatial interaction tasks include both static collision assessments (Is the vehicle too close to the one in front?) and dynamic environment reasoning (A car door ahead is openinga pedestrian exiting?). This multi-level task structure ensures models are tested on diverse and progressively complex spatial reasoning challenges. We emphasize precise image-task alignment in both dataset selection and annotation. Each questionanswer pair is manually curated and reviewed in multiple rounds to ensure accuracy, consistency, and minimal ambiguity. Unlike automated annotation, manual refinement guarantees high correlation between visual scenes and spatial reasoning tasks, strengthening OmniSpatials reliability as benchmark for future research. 3.2 Benchmark Construction This section describes how we collect data and annotations for OmniSpatial, as illustrated in Fig. 4. 3.2.1 Data Collection As outlined in Section 2, our study defines 4 spatial categories with corresponding task types. To ensure diverse and information-rich dataset, we design targeted search strategies for each task type, optimizing data collection for relevance, diversity, and complexity. Web Images Web images constitute major portion of our dataset, particularly for Perspective Taking, Dynamic Reasoning, and Spatial Interaction tasks. To ensure relevance and diversity, we formulate task-specific search terms reflecting distinct spatial scenarios, such as indoor layout and furniture arrangement for spatial relationship tasks. To minimize AI-generated image interference, we append filters like -ai and -generated to search queries. Using Googles Custom Search JSON API, Web Robotic Process Automation (Web RPA), and manual searches, we retrieve thousands of images efficiently. rigorous screening process is followed to eliminate irrelevant, low-resolution, or overly compressed images. We also removed images lacking spatial complexity, such as isolated static objects in Spatial Interaction tasks. The final dataset balances visual complexity and realism, enhancing its generalization capability across multiple tasks and scenarios while ensuring high-quality training data for VLMs. All the images are under MIT or CC-BY 4.0 licence. Exam-Based Test Questions Designed to assess complex spatial reasoning, these questions emphasize abstract spatial logic, including 3D transformations, rotations, and perspective shifts. We collect wide range of publicly available spatial cognition tests via web scraping and manual curation. Noting 5 Figure 5: PointGraph: Enhance Spatial Reasoning through Additional Scene Graphs. Figure 6: SpatialCoT: Enhancing Spatial Imagination through Novel View Synthesis. variations in task focus, difficulty, and reasoning style, we categorized the questions to maintain balanced representation. To prevent overrepresentation of any single reasoning type, we curate the dataset to ensure diverse question formats. Redundant, overly similar, or knowledge-intensive questions are removed, prioritizing those that purely test spatial reasoning. This refinement process significantly enhances the datasets quality and challenge level, providing robust evaluation framework for VLMs. Driving Test Questions These questions evaluate spatial interaction in dynamic environments, focusing on distance estimation, right-of-way rules, and hazard detection. We source them from three primary channels: (i) Image-based multiple-choice questions from driving test websites in at least three countries, capturing diverse traffic rules and scenarios. (ii) Online question banks covering standardized spatial judgment tasks such as turning, lane changes, and parking decisions. (iii) Interactive driving videos from U.S. test resources, where we extract frames, annotate bounding boxes, and formulate contextual questions (Which bounding box highlights potential traffic risk?). This multi-source approach ensures realistic and challenging dataset, enhancing VLM adaptability in traffic-related spatial reasoning. Existing Datasets We integrate two key datasets: MME [57] and HOI4D [67]. MME provides RGBD data, allowing depth-based spatial inference. We leverage its depth information for physics-based questions such as If red car passes me in 5 seconds, what speed should maintain? This ensures realistic distance and motion-based reasoning. HOI4D contains extensive human-object interaction videos. We extract sequential frames to create motion prediction tasks, such as Where will the hand holding the kettle move next? By incorporating these datasets, we introduce real-world motion and interaction complexities, further strengthening VLMs dynamic reasoning capabilities. 3.2.2 Question-Answer Annotation We employ multiple-choice questions, including binary (true/false) and four-option formats, ensuring standardized evaluation and minimizing annotation errors. While adhering to structured formats, we prioritize natural and contextually rich language to prevent overly templated expressions. Instead of rigid, mathematical phrasing (e.g., Is [A] object on the right of [B] object?), We use conversational styles more aligned with real-world reasoning (e.g., If youre entering the classroom, on which side are the students?). This approach encourages models to rely on contextual and relative spatial references rather than predefined templates. To maintain clarity, we conduct multiple rounds of validation, resolving ambiguities in referents and ensuring unique answers. In particular, we ensure the quality of the data by means of cross-validation among different annotators. We employ six human annotators for data labeling. All annotators receive comprehensive training to ensure thorough understanding of the spatial reasoning tasks, enabling them to provide unbiased and discriminative assessments. All the annotators are from the authors of this work. 3. Improving Visual Spatial Reasoning Abilities Given the diversity of spatial reasoning tasks in OmniSpatial, we further explore methods to enhance VLMs spatial reasoning capabilities. 3.3.1 PointGraph: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning via Point Relationships We attempt to employ existing expert models, such as the Segment Anything Model [49], to partition images into distinct regions.

Among the various spatial intelligence categories, Complex Logic is the most challenging. more effectively. As shown in Fig. 5, We attempt to enhance the spatial relationship comprehension of VLMs by explicitly incorporating additional spatial information cues into the models. 3.3.2 SpatialCoT: Enhancing Spatial Imagination via Novel View Synthesis We observe that VLMs are largely constrained by textual reasoning paradigms, whereas humans inherently possess robust spatial imagination, commonly known as mental imagery. To some extent, this capability of spatial imagination corresponds to novel view synthesis of objects or scenes. Fortunately, recent advances in 3D generative models [100, 118, 87, 66] can perform such tasks effectively. In our work, we employ InstantMesh [118] to synthesize novel views from input images, providing additional visual cues to enhance spatial imagination."

Benchmark Models We evaluate range of state-of-the-art vision-language models, including: Proprietary Models: These include GPT-4o series [45], GPT-4.1 series, Claude series [3], and Gemini series [2], which are state-of-the-art multimodal models accessed via an API under zeroshot settings with standardized prompts. All the system prompts can be found at Appendix D. Reasoning Models: We refer to current models employing internal long CoT as reasoning models. These models typically leverage reinforcement learning to enhance their reasoning capabilities, including models such as the o1, o3, o4-mini [46, 79], and Gemini-2.5 series [2, 97]. Due to the explicit nature of CoT, we utilize an additional text-based evaluation model [98] to determine the correctness of responses, similar to LLM-as-a-Judge [129]. Open Source Models: Our open-source set comprises Qwen-VL series [6], InternVL series [130], Gemma series [47] and LLaVA-Onevision series [63]. These models are currently the most advanced open-source VLMs. All models are deployed locally and use standardized prompts. Specialized Spatial Models: These models, including SpatialVLM [15], RoboPoint [123], SpatialBot [11], and SoFar [89], are designed specifically for spatial reasoning tasks. SpatialVLM integrates metric spatial information through 3D data synthesis and scene segmentation. RoboPoint and SpatialBot emphasize the role of point affordance in spatial reasoning. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of models by measuring their accuracy on multiplechoice questions. For standard open-source and closed-source models, we experiment with four approaches: enforcing direct output result, regular expression parsing, JSON format parsing and LLM-as-a-Judge [129]. For Reinforcement Learning-based reasoning models, due to the inherent challenges in enforcing structured output, we employ GPT-4.1-mini to assess the correctness of the models responses by comparing them with the ground truth. More detailed ablation studies are discussed in the Appendix C.1. 4.3 Main Results Overall Model Performance As illustrated in Table 2, we observe the following findings: (i) Proprietary reasoning models, such as ChatGPT o3 [79] and Gemini-2.5-pro [2], achieve the highest performance, surpassing 56% overall success rate; however, there remains significant gap compared to human-level understanding, and require lot of inference time and tokens. (ii) Open-source models also demonstrate competitive results, with large-scale models like InternVL3-78B [130] and Qwen-VL2.5-72B [115] achieving comparable performance to GPT-4.1-mini and Gemini-2.0-flashexp. (iii) Specialized Spatial Reasoning Models, due to limitations in dataset coverage and model capacity, struggle to achieve substantial improvements on comprehensive benchmarks. Category-wise Analysis Breaking down the results, we observe notable performance differences across spatial reasoning categories: (i) Leveraging their extensive world knowledge and local understanding capabilities, proprietary models have demonstrated strong performance in Dynamic Reasoning and Spatial Interaction, indicating that reasoning models possess high proficiency in temporal understanding, spatial relationship analysis, and map-based comprehension. (ii) For Pattern Geometric and Recognition Reasoning, which involve spatial imagination in planar geometry, even reasoning models designed for extended thinking can only achieve an accuracy of around 30% to 40%, slightly surpassing the random baseline. (iii) Current models exhibit limited Perspective Taking abilities, predominantly analyzing scenarios from an ego-centric viewpoint while struggling to imagine perspectives from others viewpoints. Hypothetical Ego Centric Allo Centric Method Avg. Improve GPT-4.1-mini (w/ Zero-shot CoT) 45.56 Impact of PointGraph & Spatial CoT To test whether structured segmentation improves performance, we apply PointGraph as preprocessing step for GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-flash and Qwen-VL2.5-7B. Results in Section 4.2 show clear accuracy boost, particularly in the Dynamic Reasoning and Perspective-Taking Track, validating the benefits of integrating structured object representation, while traditional textual CoT difficult to bring about significant improvement. Fig. 6 further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed Spatial CoT on the OmniSpatial Perspective-Taking track. Through novel view synthesis facilitated by InstantMesh, both GPT-4.1 and Qwen-VL2.5-7B exhibit significant performance improvements, validating the effectiveness of explicit spatial imagination.

            "content": "5.1 Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning The development of standardized benchmarks [55, 122, 65, 124, 44, 51] has been critical in assessing the performance of spatial reasoning models. Various studies have introduced innovative benchmarking methodologies [104, 15, 17, 11, 102, 89, 96] to advance spatial reasoning evaluation. For instance, Spatial VQA [26] was among the first to incorporate spatial information into vision-language models, enabling fundamental spatial relationship reasoning. SpatialRGPT-Bench [17] further introduced depth-aware reasoning, utilizing large language models to analyze spatial relationships, such as understanding relative directions and distances between specified regions in 3D scenes [104]. SpatialBench [11] categorized spatial reasoning into various hierarchical levels, extending its applicability to robotic manipulation tasks. RoboSpatial [102] proposes large-scale template-based spatial relationship dataset, focusing on positional relationships from different perspectives. VSI-Bench [121] combined video data [14, 65, 33, 56, 32] with cognitive maps [72, 4] to simulate human-like spatial cognition and optimize reasoning in dynamic environments. Recently, SoFar [89] introduced the 6-DoF SpatialBench to evaluate the understanding of orientation. While these benchmarks have made significant contributions, unified framework encompassing wide range of complex spatial reasoning tasks remains lacking. Inspired by prior spatial reasoning research [119, 114, 58, 76], we identified several limitations in existing benchmarks, such as reliance on generated images [104, 34, 48, 61, 92, 101], LLM-generated templates [59, 26, 91, 93], and domain-specific focus [117, 19, 21, 12, 28]. These issues hinder their comprehensiveness and realworld applicability. To address these gaps, our study proposes comprehensive and integrative spatial reasoning benchmark."

            "title": "A Detailed Task Design",
            "content": "OmniSpatial aims to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models, covering four major categories: Dynamic Reasoning, Complex Logic, Spatial Interaction, and Perspective Taking. Each category not only focuses on different types of spatial reasoning tasks but also includes challenges based on real-world application scenarios. This approach helps researchers better understand and enhance models multi-domain spatial reasoning abilities. The following presents the underlying considerations and practical value behind each task design. A.1 Dynamic Reasoning The Dynamic Reasoning category focuses on the models understanding of object movement and its changes, assessing the ability to make accurate judgments in uncertain or rapidly changing environments. Spatial dynamics are critical not only in robot control but also have broad applications in fields like autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance. A.1.1 Manipulation Operational Position Selection This task evaluates how models determine the optimal interaction point with objects in complex environments. Selecting the best grasping point can prevent tilting or damage to objects and improve the efficiency and precision of operations. This task is crucial in robotic grasping, especially when environmental conditions are unstable. Movement Direction Determination This task assesses the models ability to predict the movement direction of an object or itself, providing decision support for automated systems and helping to optimize robot motion strategies. Intent Recognition Intent recognition involves inferring the purpose or goal behind movement. This task is particularly important for contextual analysis, such as determining whether person is reaching for door handle to open or close door. This capability enhances the reasoning of human-robot interactions and optimizes the interaction experience of intelligent assistants and robots. Figure 7: OmniSpatial tasks.The tasks are organized into three levels, with each of the four categories of spatial abilities containing no fewer than two subtasks. The final level features more detailed subdivision, inspired by real-life scenarios . 21 A.1.2 Motion Analysis Uniform Motion The models ability to reason about uniform motion reflects its fundamental understanding of time and spatial relationships, such as estimating the speed or time required for target to move. This is applicable in areas like object tracking and path prediction, such as estimating vehicle travel time or train arrival time. Variable Motion Variable motion analysis focuses on understanding acceleration and deceleration processes. By predicting the position changes of an object during variable motion, the model can better simulate dynamic phenomena in the physical world, such as calculating braking distance for vehicles. This is critical in autonomous driving and robot control. Spatial Compatibility Tasks that assess whether an object fits within specific space directly relate to the precision of robots and automated devices in real-world operations. For instance, determining whether luggage can fit into an overhead compartment is applicable in logistics and automated warehouses, helping systems make effective object adaptation decisions. A.2 Complex Logic The Complex Logic category focuses on higher-order spatial reasoning, including tasks such as geometric transformations and pattern recognition, challenging the models ability to abstractly understand and reason in multi-dimensional spatial environments. A.2.1 Pattern Recognition Style Style recognition tasks assess the models ability to infer visual rules in structured patterns. Typical operations include completing missing parts, combining or subtracting shapes, comparing similarities and differences, and performing visual logic like black-white inversion. This skill is crucial for tasks like intelligence tests and diagrammatic reasoning. Quantity Quantity-based tasks evaluate the models ability to perform visual numerosity reasoning, focusing on implicit quantitative patterns such as the number of points, lines, regions, elements, or strokes. These tasks require abstract counting under diverse spatial configurations, often without explicit numerical labels or symbols. Attributes Attribute-based tasks evaluate the models ability to reason about non-numeric visual properties such as symmetry (axial or radial), curvature, and openness. These tasks require the recognition of structural features that do not rely on quantity but rather on geometric or perceptual traits. Location Location tasks evaluate the models ability to reason about spatial changes such as translation, rotation, and reflection. The focus is on how objects shift in space while preserving their structure. This skill is essential for grid-based reasoning, motion prediction, and geometric pattern understanding. A.2.2 Geometric Reasoning Polyhedron Unfolding This task examines whether the model can infer the 2D net of 3D object, reflecting its ability to mentally construct spatial layouts. It is particularly relevant to applications such as packaging design, industrial manufacturing, and aerospace engineering. Sections and Projections By evaluating how models interpret 2D cross-sections or projections from different viewpoints, this task challenges their capacity to connect visual appearance with internal structurekey to fields like medical imaging, architecture, and mechanical design. Mental Rotation Mental rotation requires the model to simulate the rotation of objects in mind and track changes across views. It underpins spatial reasoning in tasks ranging from CAD modeling to object manipulation in virtual and augmented reality. 22 Assembly This task involves reasoning about how separate parts fit together into coherent whole, testing the models understanding of geometric constraints. It has broad relevance in robotics, structural analysis, and physical assembly planning. Analytical Geometry These tasks are inspired by classic geometry problems, requiring models to reason about spatial relations using angles, distances, and symmetry. They bridge mathematical logic with visual structure, supporting applications in structured reasoning and spatial abstraction. A.3 Spatial Interaction The Spatial Interaction category evaluates models ability to reason about interactions with objects and environments. It includes tasks such as Traffic Analysis, Localization, and Geospatial Strategy, reflecting the models understanding and application of spatial knowledge in real-world scenarios. A.3.1 Traffic Analysis Anomaly Detection This task focuses on identifying potential dangers or traffic violations in complex scenes, such as unsafe following distances or unusual vehicle behavior. It plays key role in ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. Sign Recognition This task evaluates the models ability to detect and interpret traffic signs, including speed limits, no-entry zones, and yield signs. Accurate recognition is critical for safe and rule-compliant decision-making. Action Recognition This task involves identifying or predicting the actions of traffic participants, such as driver gestures, police signals, or pedestrian intentions. It is important for understanding dynamic human behavior in traffic environments. Risk Detection This task aims to detect immediate hazards in the environment, such as an opening car door or pedestrian crossing the road. Timely detection supports effective avoidance and control strategies. Behavior Guidance This task provides context-aware behavioral suggestions, such as advising to turn off high beams or reminding that parking is prohibited. It enhances overall driving safety and compliance. Contextual Analysis This task assesses the models ability to interpret spatial relations and behaviors based on environmental cues. For example, estimating wind conditions to anticipate overtaking behavior or understanding road status to infer potential risks. A.3.2 Localization UI Interaction This task requires the model to determine which icon should be selected within user interface based on contextual understanding, and to accurately localize its position. It reflects the models ability to integrate semantic interpretation with spatial reasoning, supporting applications in intelligent assistants and automated interface control. Object Detection This task involves identifying specific target objects within an image. It is often paired with spatial localization to jointly assess what the object is and where it is located. Spatial Localization This task focuses on determining the precise position of objects within scene. It is commonly evaluated alongside object detection to answer questions like What is at this location? or Where is this object? Pose Estimation This task estimates the orientation and spatial configuration of objects, such as detecting whether cup is upright or tipped over. It is frequently integrated with spatial localization to enable more nuanced scene understanding. 23 A.3.3 Geospatial Strategy Spatial Recognition Assesses the models capacity to identify spatial structures such as rooms, corridors, or zones within scene. This is essential for semantic navigation and indoor mapping. Location Recognition This task evaluates the models ability to identify specific locations on map or scene, such as recognizing the position marked as You are here or locating designated landmark. It reflects the models capacity to associate spatial markers with real-world positions. Region Recognition Focuses on distinguishing and classifying regions in broader spatial context, such as residential vs. industrial zones on map. Route Interpretation Tests the models ability to follow or explain route depicted in map or scene. It requires understanding directional arrows, route labels, and spatial transitions. Route Design Involves selecting or generating an optimal path to reach given goal, considering spatial constraints and possible alternatives. Route Selection Compares multiple candidate routes and chooses the most suitable one based on efficiency, safety, or contextual requirements. Navigation Evaluates the models ability to understand smartphone or in-vehicle navigation interfaces, including interpreting turn-by-turn directions, identifying route segments, and understanding map overlays. This is crucial for building intelligent voice assistants and real-time guidance systems. Map/Scene Conversion Tests the ability to mentally convert between map views and real-world scenes, which is critical in correlating schematic representations with physical surroundings. Legend Recognition It requires identifying and interpreting map symbols (e.g., stairs, elevators, emergency exits) and foundational skill in navigation and spatial reasoning. Terrain Identification Focuses on distinguishing types of terrain (e.g., flat, uphill, water-crossing), which is essential for planning safe and feasible paths in outdoor navigation or robotics. A.4 Perspective Taking This category evaluates the models ability to understand spatial relationships from different viewpoints. Since changes in perspective directly affect what is observed, the ability to reason across varying angles is essential for robotic perception and interaction. A.4.1 Egocentric Count Counting the number of visible objects from the current perspective is crucial for dynamic interaction. For example, in robotic grasping tasks, knowing how many targets are visible helps determine the appropriate operation strategy. Size Judging the size of an object from the observers viewpoint aids robots or virtual systems in depth perception, helping assess whether an object can be grasped or properly placed. Direction This refers to the direction directly seen by the observer. It is especially important in autonomous driving scenarios, where understanding object movement helps predict traffic conditions and enables timely responses. Order Analyzing the arrangement of multiple objects in an image is essential for robotic operations, helping prioritize which objects to interact with first. Distance The distance between objects as perceived from the observers viewpoint is key capability in navigation systems, enabling path planning and obstacle avoidance. 24 A.4.2 Allocentric Count Understanding how the perceived quantity of objects changes under different viewpoints is key. Due to variations in position and orientation, occlusion often occursfor example, driver may have blind spots, while road surveillance camera can see objects hidden in those areas. This task evaluates the models ability to judge the difference in object counts from various observation points. Size This task involves evaluating an objects size from specified observers viewpoint. Due to the general principle that closer objects appear larger and distant ones appear smaller, objects of the same size may look different to different observers. The model is expected to either infer the true size based on reference objects or estimate how perceived size changes with viewing position. Direction This task emphasizes judging directions from abstract positions, such as another agents viewpoint or map. The answers often differ from what is directly observed, requiring one to adopt the targets perspectiveengaging in perspective-taking. It is crucial not only for large-scale path planning but also for understanding an objects intrinsic orientation. Order This task requires observing the arrangement of objects from specified viewpointfor example, the seating order of students in the front row as seen by teacher on the podium, which is exactly reversed from what camera at the back of the classroom would capture. Only by understanding what the target sees can one make accurate predictions or judgments about the scene. Distance Differences in the observers position and orientation lead to variations in perceived size and distance. For example, in the same scene, photographer taking pictures of the same object from different camera angles will capture different impressions of its size and distance. Changing the camera position essentially means changing the perspective. This ability is vital for coordination and environmental assessment in human-robot interaction or multi-robot collaborative tasks. A.4.3 Hypothetical Perspective Taking This category focuses on imagining the scene from specified but non-existent viewpoint, requiring the model to mentally adopt fictional positionan advanced form of perspective-taking in spatial reasoning. Count Predicting how many target objects would be visible from hypothetical viewpointfor example, person standing at the opposite corner of the street may see different distribution of objects. The model must reason about occlusion, orientation, and visibility from the imagined perspective. Size Inferring the apparent size of objects from hypothetical location and direction. For instance, the same object may appear larger when viewed up close or smaller when viewed from above. The model needs to simulate how visual scale changes with altered viewpoints. Direction Reasoning about how an objects direction appears from location where no observer is present. For example, pedestrian walking toward doorway would appear head-on from the entrance, but present different direction from side view. Order Simulating the arrangement of objects from another location helps assess how spatial sequences change across viewpoints. For example, the seating order seen from the podium may be the reverse of whats seen from the back of the room. Distance Estimating relative distances between objects from hypothetical position requires mentally adopting new viewpoint. This supports effective planning and coordination in tasks such as multirobot navigation or collaborative manipulation."

            "content": "B.1 Spatial Vision-Language Models Spatial vision-language models integrate computer vision [1, 37, 80, 90] and natural language processing [6, 115, 9, 2, 107, 108, 128] to enhance machine understanding of spatial relationships. Recent research [88, 15, 17, 11, 102, 123, 89] has increasingly focused on extending vision-language models to support spatial reasoning in dynamic and 3D environments. One of the pioneering works in this domain, SpatialVLM [15], has significantly advanced spatial reasoning by constructing an RGB-D based visual question-answering dataset. These models [45, 45, 97, 115] effectively process multimodal data containing spatial information, serving as bridge between visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Further advancements [62, 60, 94, 105, 120, 99, 116, 103] include SpatialRGPT [17], which extends RGB-D spatial understanding by incorporating 3D scene graphs and spatial data to improve inference capabilities. Similarly, SpatialBot [11] explores hierarchical deep reasoning mechanisms to handle depth and spatial structures in complex environments. Recently, SoFar [89] proposed semantic orientation and trained an open-world orientation model to enhance the orientation understanding of VLMs, significantly improving spatial understanding and robotic operation capabilities [18, 25, 73, 131, 113, 43, 74, 27, 42, 89]. However, existing research remains limited in addressing the full complexity and comprehensiveness of spatial reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, our study aims to develop more comprehensive benchmark that rigorously evaluates spatial reasoning capabilities. B.2 Spatial Reasoning in Psychology In psychology, spatial reasoning refers to an individuals ability to acquire, organize, utilize, and adapt spatial knowledge, recognized as one of the nine primary reasonings [35]. To systematically characterize this ability, Buckley et al. [10]proposed factor analysis-based framework, distinguishing between spatial visualization, spatial relations (such as mental rotation), and spatial orientation. Malanchini et al. [69] further identified strong correlation between spatial orientation and object manipulation skills. Additionally, Newcombe & Shipley [75]introduced classification system for spatial thinking, dividing spatial reasoning into two dimensions: intrinsic-extrinsic and static-dynamic. Furthermore, many studies also have contributed to the development of frameworks [112, 52, 69, 39, 70] and evaluation methods [29, 111, 110, 40] for spatial reasoning. Their framework highlights the distinction between object-centric spatial properties and external reference frames, offering valuable insights for applications such as navigation and path planning. These psychological frameworks provide complementary perspectives for understanding and assessing spatial reasoning, offering theoretical foundations for embodied intelligent systems. Inspired by these classifications, our study proposes novel taxonomy for visual-spatial reasoning, aiming to advance spatial reasoning research in vision-language models."

Because our benchmark introduces novel visualspatial reasoning task, Appendix C.1 reports the performance impact of different prompting and evaluation schemes. We consider three prompting paradigmsDirect QA, Zero-shot CoT, and Manual CoTand three evaluation methods: (i) regex-based field extraction (RE), in which the VLM is instructed to place its answer in fixed slot at the end of the response; (ii) JSON extraction, where the answer must appear in dedicated answer field; and (iii) LLM-based free-form evaluation, for which we employ GPT-4.1-mini as an adjudicator. We observe that reasoning-centric models that strongly obey formatting directives (e.g., Gemini-2.5flash) cannot be reliably scored with regex extraction, because their compulsory chain-of-thought interferes with the required output template. For standard models, all three evaluation strategies yield comparable scores, and both CoT variants consistently outperform the Direct QA baseline by small margin.

Our benchmark comprises rich collection of data samples spanning diverse scenarios, resolutions, lighting conditions, and geographical regions. It includes both absolute numerical analyses and relative spatial relationships, aiming to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. Limitation & Future Works Although OmniSpatial includes some image clips with dynamic information from HOI4D [67], the complexity of the operational tasks still lags behind that of long videos [121, 14]. Moreover, while PointGraph & Spatial CoT enhances VLMs spatial understanding through point cues, the improvement is not fundamental in nature. Spatial reasoning tasks are more like mathematics and coding tasks, require longer and more complex reasoning [22, 46]. 3D information is crucial for spatial reasoning, and future work involves introducing 3D representation [23, 86, 88, 87] and perception [84, 85, 127, 30], as well as 3D VLMs [81, 24, 36, 88, 89], reasoning model [125, 22, 79] and knowledge distillation [126, 41, 23, 86].
