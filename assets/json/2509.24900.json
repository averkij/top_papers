            "content": "The field of AI-powered content creation is being transformed by unified multimodal models capable of both generating and editing images from natural language instructions (Deng et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025),. Despite these achievements, creating training data that comprehensively addresses the full spectrum of real-world applications remains challenging. Existing datasets have made valuable contributions in areas such as style transfer, basic object manipulation, and increasingly, text rendering (Wu et al., 2025a)a capability that has rightfully gained attention for its practical importance. However, certain complex scenarios that require specialized knowledge or sophisticated reasoning still present difficulties for current models. For instance, tasks involving technical illustrations for scientific education, or editing operations that require executing multiple instructions simultaneously, often reveal limitations in model capabilities. These challenges suggest opportunities for more structured approaches to data collection and taxonomy design. To help address these opportunities, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, dataset designed to support the development of more capable and robust multimodal systems. Our work builds upon previous research while expanding coverage to include additional challenging scenarios. The dataset is organized around hierarchical taxonomy that systematically addresses both established challenges and less explored areas. As shown in Figure 1 and 2, this includes not only refining existing focus areas like style control and text rendering, but also introducing categories such as: 1. Scientific Imagery: Supporting technical illustration needs in fields like physics, chemistry, and biology, where visualizations play critical role in education. 2. Complex Instruction Editing: Addressing scenarios where users naturally provide multiple editing instructions that should be executed in concert. 3. Spatial Reasoning and Causal Inference: Expanding 3 Figure 2: Illustrative examples of image editing from OpenGPT-4o-Image. We comprehensively categorize image editing tasks into six groups: (a) Subject Manipulation, focusing on region-based editing; (b) Text Editing, involving modifications to textual content embedded in images; (c) Complex Editing, involving the combination of multiple simple editing instructions; (d) Multi-Turn Editing, consisting of iterative, multi-round editing interactions; (e) Other Challenging Editings, covering additional difficult editing scenarios; and (f) Global Editing, which targets holistic modifications across the entire image. beyond basic object recognition to include more sophisticated relational understanding. To ensure scalability and consistency, we develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality instruction-image pairs. This approach allows us to create 80,000 samples spanning 11 major domains and 51 subtasks with controlled diversity and difficulty levels. Our quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the utility of this approach. When fine-tuned on OpenGPT-4o-Image, several leading models show consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks. For example, UniWorld-V1 (Lin et al., 2025) achieves 18% relative improvement on ImgEdit-Bench (Ye et al., 2025), while Harmon (Wu et al., 2025d) shows 13% gain on GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2024). These improvements suggest that our structured approach to data construction can help models better handle complex and specialized tasks. In summary, our primary contributions are: hierarchical taxonomy for image generation and editing that systematically decomposes complex tasks into 51 fine-grained sub-capabilities across 11 major domains. For image generation, this includes five core modules: Style Control, Complex Instruction Following, In-Image Text Rendering, Spatial Reasoning, and Scientific Imagery. For image editing, we define six categories with 21 subtasks, including Subject Manipulation, Text Editing, Complex Instruction Editing, Multi-Turn Editing, Global Editing, and other challenging forms. An automated, scalable pipeline for generating high-quality training data that GPT-4o to produce 80k instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity and difficulty levels. Our pipeline ensures comprehensive coverage of both fundamental capabilities and challenging scenarios through systematic task definition and template-based generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the substantial utility of our dataset and methodology. We employ four leading models spanning different architectural paradigmsincluding UniWorld-V1, Harmon, OmniGen2, and MagicBrushto ensure the generalizability of our findings. The models 4 are evaluated on four standardized benchmarks: GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench for image editing capabilities, and GenEval and DPG-Bench for text-to-image generation quality. The evaluation reveals consistent and significant improvements across all tested configurations. We hope that OpenGPT-4o-Image will contribute to future research by providing resource that addresses broader range of real-world applications, and that our methodology inspires further work on systematic data construction for multimodal AI."

            "content": "2.1 Unified Multimodal Large Language Models The development of Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (Wu et al., 2025d; Deng et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025) that integrate both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities has become key research direction. This unification is motivated by the inherent synergy between understanding and generationdeep semantic comprehension enables controllable, high-quality synthesis (Wu et al., 2025a; Deng et al., 2025), while generative capability enhances complex reasoning through mechanisms like thinking with generated images Zhang et al. (2025b;a). Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models for perception (Bai et al., 2025) and diffusion models (Labs, 2024) for synthesis have made such unified approaches increasingly feasible. Training data represents another critical challenge in UFM development. For multimodal understanding tasks, the research community has established numerous large-scale, diverse datasets covering various capabilities such as visual question answering, image captioning, and visual reasoning. In contrast, high-quality datasets for generation and editing tasks remain significantly more limited. Existing generation datasets primarily focus on basic capabilities like style transfer and simple object manipulation, while complex scenarios requiring specialized knowledge, multi-instruction execution, or sophisticated reasoning remain underexplored. This data imbalance between understanding and generation capabilities motivates the construction of more comprehensive and challenging datasets to support the development of truly capable unified models. 2.2 Datasets for Image Generation The advancement of text-to-image generation has been driven by several large-scale datasets (see Table 1 for representative examples). For instance, LAION-Aesthetics-UMAP (dclure, 2022), focus on curating images with high aesthetic scores, while DenseFusion-1M (Li et al., 2024a) provides dense descriptions rich in visual detail. Others, such as Megalith (madebyollin, 2024) and Public Domain 12M (Meyer et al., 2024), contribute vast image resources from real-world or public-domain sources. However, often constrained by the capabilities of the models available at the time of their creation, these earlier datasets exhibit limitations in their ability to support complex semantic understanding and precise instruction following. Recently, ShareGPT-4o-Image (Chen et al., 2025b) has made significant strides in data quality by leveraging the advanced generation capabilities of GPT-4o. While this dataset effectively distills the models generative potential, its taxonomy is relatively coarse-grained and lacks systematic, fine-grained structure. This somewhat limits its utility for targeted evaluation and in-depth analysis of specific model capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, text-to-image dataset built upon clear, hierarchical taxonomy. It is designed to provide resource that combines diversity, practicality, and evaluative depth, enabling more precise training and analysis of models multi-dimensional instruction-following abilities. 2.3 Datasets for Image Editing Table 1 compares representative instruction-driven image editing datasets (Brooks et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Hui et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2025b; Wei et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2025). Most of these datasets (Brooks et al., 2023) rely primarily on open-source models to generate edited images. Although MagicBrush (Zhang et al., 2023) and SEED-Data-Edit (Ge et al., 2024) incorporate varying degrees of human quality control, their limited ability to fully interpret editing instructions often leads to suboptimal results. Specifically, InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) employs GPT-3 (Floridi &Chiriatti, 2020) to generate editing instructions and P2P (Hertz et al., 2022) for image editing; MagicBrush leverages extensive human annotations to improve data fidelity; HQ-Edit (Hui et al., 2024) uses DALLE to produce paired images, but the outputs lack realism; AnyEdit (Jiang et al., 2025b) and OmniEdit (Wei et al., 2024) design alternative pipelines to support diverse editing tasks; and UltraEdit(Zhao et al., 2024) introduces large-scale region-based editing dataset. In addition, ShareGPT-4o-Image (Chen et al., 2025b) constructs 46K instruction-driven image editing pairs using GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024), but it fails to adequately cover broad spectrum of editing types, such as reference image editing. In contrast, we introduce 5 Table 1: Comparison of Existing Datasets and OpenGPT-4o-Image.

            "content": "OpenGPT-4o-Image encompasses broader spectrum of categories, more precise and comprehensive instructions, and substantial collection of practical as well as challenging generation and editing tasks. Most importantly, the quality of both image generation and editing achieved are remarkable. Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 enumerate the categories of image generation and editing, while Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 provide detailed account of the data creation pipeline. More detailed information on the dataset distribution can be found in the Appendix A. 3.1 Generation Type Definition Style Control. This module is designed to enhance the models ability to render diverse range of visual styles. Comprising substantial 13k samples, it is organized into comprehensive collection of 6 Figure 4: Image Editing Data Construction Pipeline. (a) illustrates the source image acquisition and demonstrates the use of GPT-4o for generating instructions and producing the edited image. (b) shows the process of reference image editing, where Subject-Driven Image Generation is used to create reference and edited images, with GPT-4o applied for inpainting the source image. four distinct categories. The first, Artistic Traditions, covers historical and cultural art forms, including Western movements (Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Cubism), Eastern traditions (Japanese Ukiyoe, Ink Wash Painting, Traditional Chinese Painting), and contemporary forms like Graffiti Art. The second category, Media and Illustration, focuses on aesthetics from popular media and illustration, spanning animation (Ghibli Animation Style, Pixar Animation Style, Classic Animation Style), comics (Japanese Manga Style), digital-native styles (Pixel Art, Block-Based Art, Mosaic Style), and foundational techniques like Sketch and Line Art. The third, Photographic Styles, is dedicated to the visual language of photography, encompassing technical styles (Analog Film Aesthetic, High Dynamic Range (HDR)), artistic choices (Monochrome Photography), and mood-based aesthetics (Ethereal and Dreamlike, Vintage and Retro Aesthetics). Finally, Speculative and Fantasy Styles explores fictional genres such as Cyberpunk, Steampunk, Cosmic and Space Opera, and Digital Futurism. Complex Instruction Following. This module, comprising focused set of 6k samples, addresses the models capacity for precise instruction adherence, particularly for prompts involving multiple constraints and complex logical relationships. We decompose this capability into several specific sub-tasks. These include the composition of static scenes through Multi-Attribute Combination and Multi-Subject Interaction and Action, as well as arranging elements according to Complex Spatial Composition. Furthermore, the module assesses the understanding of dynamic and sequential concepts via Temporal Sequence Coherence and Action Trajectory Rendering. Finally, it probes the models abstract reasoning abilities with prompts requiring Causal Reasoning. In-Image Text Rendering. This module addresses in-image text rendering, capability of high practical value that has been largely unaddressed in prior instruction-following datasets. It is designed around core of 3k samples to systematically improve the models ability to create accurate and aesthetic textgraphic compositions. The module covers foundational aspects such as Textual Accuracy (verbatim content rendering) and Typography (font control). It then progresses to more complex structural and relational challenges, including Structured Text Layout for multi-line arrangements and Text-Graphic Integration for the coherent placement of text within the image. Finally, the scope is expanded to include Multilingual Support for non-English scripts and the nuanced task of aligning Textual Tone and Style with the images overall aesthetic. Spatial Reasoning. In contrast to the prior modules, which primarily emphasize semantic and aesthetic interpretation, the Spatial Reasoning component focuses on the models understanding of fundamental spatial and logical relationships. Consequently, tasks in this section demand geometric precision and logical fidelity. To assess this capability, we utilize dedicated dataset of 8k samples divided into several categories, including basic topological relations and discrete 2D Relative Position. The models numerical capacity is tested via Object Counting, while its understanding of geometric properties and comparisons is evaluated through Size Reasoning, Symmetry Analysis, and Comparative Reasoning. Scientific Imagery. The Scientific Imagery module extends the applicability of text-to-image models to specialized professional domains, addressing the growing demand for image generation in scientific research and education where relevant training data remains scarce. To address this existing gap, we provide 10k samples covering breadth of disciplines, including Mathematics, Physics, and Mechanical Engineering; natural sciences such as Astronomy and Earth Science; life sciences like Biological studies and Ecology; and topics from Culture and History. The introduction of this module provides data foundation for exploring the models potential in professional knowledge visualization and its applications in scientific communication and education. 7 3.2 Edit Type Definition We define six categories of editing tasks: Subject Manipulation, Text Editing, Complex Editing, Multi-Turn Editing, Global Editing, and other challenging forms of editing. More specifically, these categories are further divided into 21 subtasks, which collectively encompass wide range of practical instruction-based image editing scenarios. Subject Manipulation. Building on classical instruction-based image editing, we define Subject Manipulation as the precise local modification of specific target objects within an image, while preserving the integrity and consistency of the background and other semantically irrelevant content. Subject Manipulation encompasses five operations: Add, Remove, Replace, Alter, and Object Extraction, comprising 19k samples. Specifically, Alter refers to modifications that change only the attributes of an object, whereas Replace involves comprehensive transformation of the object itself. Additionally, Add and Remove denote the insertion or deletion of an object, respectively, whereas Object Extraction refers to isolating and extracting specific object from the image. Text Editing. Given the substantial gap between GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and existing open-source unified models in terms of text editing capabilities, we define Text Editing as the task of manipulating and modifying text elements embedded within images. In contrast to conventional image editing, which often focuses on coarse-grained objects, text editing requires deeper comprehension of the rich semantics embedded in editing instructions and finer-grained editing capabilities. Drawing inspiration from Subject Manipulation, we further define four types: Text Add, Replace, Alter, and Remove, including 3k samples. Complex Instruction Editing. With the increasing demand for image editing, users often issue multiple instructions that they expect to be executed simultaneously. However, under such scenarios, existing models frequently suffer from limited instruction-following capabilities and reduce image generation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of Complex Instruction Image Editing, comprising total of 4k samples, designed to enhance the ability of unified models to handle complex instructions. Furthermore, we categorize complex instructions based on their level of complexity. Each complex instruction consists of two to four distinct sub-editing operations, which are drawn from Text Editing and Subject Manipulation except Object Extraction. Multi-turn Editing. Building on the insights from interactive text modifications in multimodal large language models, we extend the concept of multi-turn interactions to the domain of image editing. In this context, we introduce Multi-Turn Image Editing, including 1,500 samples, where iterative user interactions progressively guide the modification of image content. Specifically, we categorize the task by the number of interaction rounds, distinguishing between two-round, three-round, and four-round editing scenarios. This task is expected to strengthen unified models in multi-turn image editing and to achieve controllable editing aligned with user satisfaction. Global Editing. In addition to local image editing, we also introduce global editing, comprising total of 4k samples, which encompasses Background Replacement and Style Transfer. For style transfer, we design 11 distinct styles, including Cyberpunk Style, Ghibli Style, Ink Painting Style, Disney Animation Style, Hand-drawn Style, Monai Style, and others. In contrast, background replacement operations focus on substituting the surrounding environment while maintaining the integrity of foreground objects. This editing type maintains the subject elements and their spatial relationships, ensuring seamless integration into entirely different environments. Other Challenging Editing. Beyond the aforementioned categories, we define set of challenging editing tasks, including reference image editing, motion modification, material transformation, and object movement. Reference image editing involves the seamless incorporation of specified subjects into the original image. Motion modification emphasizes altering and adjusting the expressions and movements of objects, thereby enabling flexible control over their dynamic characteristics. Material transformation focuses on modifying the texture or composition of clothing and other materials. Finally, we introduce novel task, Object movement, which entails repositioning an object from one location to another within the image while preserving spatial coherence and visual realism. 3.3 Automatic Dataset Pipeline for Image Generation To systematically construct the large-scale, hierarchical training dataset for OpenGPT-4o-gen, we formulated and adhered to general data construction pipeline, illustrated in Figure 3. This pipeline is designed to ensure that the data for each submodule has clear training objectives, controlled diversity, reasonable difficulty distribution, and reliable quality. The process transforms abstract capability targets into concrete, trainable data and consists of two primary phases. Task Definition and Scoping. This initial phase marks the starting point of the construction process, 8 where we clearly delineate the target capability for each submodule. We begin with Capability Definition and Boundary Setting, precisely defining the core skill each module aims to train. To ensure the purity of the training signal, we establish strict boundaries, specifying its scope and exclusions. For example, in the Relative Position module, we focused on planar relations like left of and above, while intentionally excluding other spatial concepts like 3D perspective or topological containment. For more complex capabilities, we perform Hierarchical Categorization, decomposing them into logically interconnected sub-categories. In the Causal Reasoning module, for instance, we divided the task into levels such as Explicit Causality, Implicit Inference, and Complex Causal Chains to enable more granular training and evaluation. Finally, we implement Difficulty Grading for each submodule, assessing difficulty based on factors like instruction complexity, required background knowledge, and the length of the reasoning chain. This allows us to generate instruction sets with well-distributed range of difficulty. Structured Prompt Generation. Once the task definitions are established, this phase focuses on the efficient and high-quality generation of instruction. We first implement Resource Pool Design, constructing series of structured resource pools to serve as foundational components for prompt generation. These pools typically include an Object Pool (various entities), Relation/Action Pool (core verbs, prepositions, and their synonyms), and Qualifier Pool (scenes, materials, adjectives) to increase the naturalness of the prompts. We then employ Template-Based Generation, designing multiple templates with diverse syntactic structures and populating them with randomly sampled components from the resource pools. This method allows us to generate instructions at scale that possess both structural consistency and linguistic variety. To further ensure data quality, we apply Diversity Strategy, which includes varying the presentation format of instructions, controlling the combinatorial logic of content elements, and judiciously injecting content-aligned stylistic elements into subset of prompts to enhance their realism. 3.4 Automatic Dataset Pipeline for Image Editing Data Preparation. We construct the dataset corpus by integrating multiple high-quality sources, including SEED-Data-Edit (Ge et al., 2024), ImgEdit (Ye et al., 2025), GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) generated images, OmniEdit (Wei et al., 2024), and curated collection of high-resolution images as the initial source corpus. Compared with existing datasets, our corpus contains source images of substantially higher quality, broader spectrum of editing categories, more diverse instruction types, and correspondingly higher-quality edited results. To ensure dataset quality, we select distinct source corpora for each editing type. For text editing, GPT-4o is used to generate images with embedded textual elements, serving as the source corpus for text-related tasks. Reference image editing utilizes reference-target image pairs from the subject-driven generation component of OmniEdit, which are adopted as target and reference images in our corpus. Motion and material modifications are based on original images from ImgEdit. For object removal tasks, we include subset of carefully curated high-resolution images, each with resolution exceeding 1024 pixels. Finally, for multi-turn and other editing tasks, we leverage the multi-turn corpus from SEED-Data-Edit as it contains high-quality real-world images. Instruction Generation. We provide the original image, the editing type, and set of in-context examples to facilitate prompt generation. For style transfer, we define 10 distinct styles and generate the associated instructions. Additionally, we provide sub-reference editing types for complex instruction-based images, including Subject Manipulation and Text Editing, and supply carefully designed examples to guide the generation of diverse instructions. For reference image editing, we draw inspiration from subject-driven image generation. As illustrated in Figure 4(b), we provide the reference image, the result generated from subject-driven generation, and several in-context examples, which are then used with GPT-4o to generate instructions. For multi-turn image editing, we define 10 subcategories of tasks, including Text Editing, Global Editing, and Subject Manipulation. We further provide in-context examples and generate interactive multi-turn editing instructions. Image Generation. To construct the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset, the core of our data generation process relied on the gpt-image-1 API, which was employed to regenerate or augment all imageinstruction pairs. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 4(b), for subject-driven image editing, we utilize inpainting instructions together with the edited outputs to generate the corresponding original source images. Finally, multi-turn image editing generates the results of each round progressively, ensuring the overall quality of the editing process."

Section 4.3 provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the experimental outcomes. 4.1 Experimental Setting Baselines. For the data scaling experiments, we employ UniWorld-V1 (Lin et al., 2025), which integrates Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) as the comprehension model and FLUX-dev (Labs et al., 2025) as the vision generation model. For the comprehensive evaluations, we conducted extensive comparisons across different modeling paradigms, including diffusion-based and autoregressive frameworks. The evaluated models comprise UniWorld-V1, Harmon (Wu et al., 2025d), OmniGen2 (Wu et al., 2025c), MagicBrush (Zhang et al., 2023), and OmniGen (Xiao et al., 2025). Benchmarks. Our evaluation methodology encompasses thorough quality assessment for both image generation and editing datasets. For the image generation dataset, we comprehensively evaluate its quality using GenEval and DPG-Bench; GenEval specifically assesses compositionality, while DPG-Bench focuses on semantic alignment. Similarly, our image editing dataset is comprehensively evaluated across two widely used benchmarks: GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench. GEdit-Bench covers 11 distinct evaluation dimensions and assesses visual text and portrait editing, whereas ImgEdit-Bench further provides fine-grained evaluation of complex instruction-based image editing. 4.2 Data Scaling Experiments To validate the effectiveness of our dataset, as shown in Table 6, we perform uniform sampling on subsets of the dataset at 20K, 30K, and 40K sizes. Since relying on single benchmark can introduce bias and lead to incomplete evaluations, we employ two benchmarks for comprehensive assessment. We also compute the overall average across both benchmarks and observe consistent upward trend in the average performance as the dataset size increases. Additionally, given the relatively small increase in performance between 30K and 40K, we select the 40K dataset size. 4.3 Compressive Evaluations Performance Improvement on Image Editing Model. As shown in Table 2 and Table 5, we finetune on MagicBrush (Zhang et al., 2023), OmniGen (Xiao et al., 2025), UniWorld-V1 (Lin et al., 2025), and OmniGen2 (Wu et al., 2025c). MagicBrush achieves improvements of 21.1% and 21.7% on ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench, respectively. OmniGen gains of 6.9% and 14.0% on the two benchmarks. UniWorld-V1 improves by 18.4% on ImgEdit-Bench and 12.0% on GEdit-Bench, while OmniGen2 achieved 12.7% and 8.8% improvements, respectively. The results indicate that leveraging more advanced comprehension and editing models, together with fine-tuning on our high-quality dataset, enables UniWorld-V1 and OmniGen2 to achieve notable improvements across multiple dimensions, such as Adjust, and Compose. 10 Table 3: Comparison of fine-tuning results of different models on our dataset on GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2024) benchmark.

We fine-tune four representative models: OmniGen, OmniGen2, UniWorld-V1, and Harmon. As detailed in Table 3 and Table 4, all models exhibit significant performance improvements after this process. For instance, Harmons performance surges by 13.2% on Geneval and 5.3% on DPG-Bench. Even Omnigen2, which shows the most modest gains, still achieves robust improvements of 2.5% and 1.9%. We hypothesize that Harmons markedly superior performance compared to the other models stems from its efficient architecture and smaller 1.5B parameter size. Notably, these substantial results are achieved using our dataset of only 40k samples. This strongly demonstrates that our datasets clear taxonomy and high-quality instructions enhance models text-to-image capabilities, particularly in its precision for following complex instructions. Performance Improvement on Unified Dataset. As shown in Table 7, we finetune UniWorld-V1 using both ShareGPT-4o and our image editing dataset. Our dataset achieves significant improvements, surpassing ShareGPT-4o by 3.2% on ImgEdit-Bench, 1.7% on GEdit-Bench, 1.2% on Geneval and 1.1% on DPG-Bench. Under the same training configuration, our dataset enhances the models performance due to its more comprehensive categorization, richer set of editing instructions. Quantitative Comparison. Due to the limitations of quantitative metrics in evaluating editing tasks, we further conduct qualitative evaluations to assess the effectiveness of our dataset, as illustrated in Figure. 6. Before finetuning, UniWorld-V1 exhibits suboptimal performance in following complex instructions, particularly in tasks involving object replacement and action modification. After efficient fine-tuning with the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset, the model demonstrates substantial qualitative improvements. As shown in Figure 6, the fine-tuned UniWorld-V1 successfully replaces the hat with teapot and raises the persons right arm, whereas the original model fails to execute these editing instructions effectively. Next, we turn to the Harmon models improvements on text-to-image generation tasks. Here, the fine-tuned model demonstrates comprehensive performance gains, particularly in its ability to follow complex instructions. Specifically, we observe significant enhancements in handling various fine-grained capabilities, including in-image text rendering, multi-entity composition, temporal and spatial reasoning, and relative size comparison. These improvements collectively indicate that our dataset effectively strengthens the models integrated understanding of multi-dimensional, complex semantics and its generation fidelity. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and data scaling experiments, as detailed in Appendix B. These experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our image generation and editing dataset yields consistent improvements across wide range of benchmarks, while also exhibiting qualitative superiority. Notably, our approach achieves substantial improvements over concurrent work such as ShareGPT-4o-Image. The detailed characterization of our dataset distribution and our data curation and quality control strategy 11 are presented in Appendix and Appendix C, respectively."

            "content": "This paper introduces OpenGPT-4o-Image, comprehensive dataset designed to advance multimodal AI capabilities in image generation and editing through systematic task decomposition and automated data construction. The work addresses significant gaps in existing datasets by providing 80,000 high-quality instruction-image pairs across 11 major domains and 51 subtasks, with particular emphasis on previously underexplored areas such as scientific imagery, complex instruction following, and multi-turn editing. The key contributions include hierarchical taxonomy that systematically categorizes image generation into five core modules (Style Control, Complex Instruction Following, In-Image Text Rendering, Spatial Reasoning, and Scientific Imagery) and image editing into six categories with 21 subtasks. The automated pipeline leverages GPT-4o to ensure scalable, consistent data generation while maintaining controlled diversity and difficulty distribution. Experimental validation demonstrates the datasets effectiveness across multiple model architectures and benchmarks. However, the work has limitations. The reliance on GPT-4o for data generation may introduce biases inherent to that model, and the evaluation is primarily conducted on existing benchmarks which may not fully capture real-world application scenarios."

            "title": "A Dataset Distribution",
            "content": "A.1 Distribution of Image Editing Data In this section, we provide more detailed characterization of the distribution of the image editing dataset. As summarized in Table 9, the corpus is organized into six major categories: Subject Manipulation (19k), Text Editing (3k), Complex Instruction Editing (4k), Multi-turn Editing (1.5k), Global Editing (5k), and Other Challenging Editing (8k). Because Subject Manipulation and Global Editing represent practical and canonical editing tasks, we allocate comparatively larger quantities to these categories to strengthen performance in these areas. For Text Editing, Multi-turn Editing, and the sub-tasks under Other Challenging Editing, we employ templated generation to curate relatively smaller but targeted set of instances, enabling an examination of how high-quality fine-tuning translates into improvements for these capabilities. Finally, we include moderate amount of Complex Instruction Editing to further enhance instruction following; this capability shows substantial gains after fine-tuning, as reflected by marked improvements on ImgEdit-Bench.

The corpus is organized into five major categories: Style Control (13k), Scientific Imagery (10k), Spatial Reasoning (8k), Complex Instruction Following (6k), and In-Image Text Rendering (3k). The largest allocations are given to Style Control and Scientific Imagery to, respectively, master foundational pillar of creative expression 15 and establish robust data foundation for professional domains where high-quality training data is typically scarce. Substantial resources are also devoted to Spatial Reasoning and Complex Instruction Following to systematically enhance the models grasp of logical relationships, geometric precision, and compositional directives. Finally, more targeted collection for In-Image Text Rendering (3k) is included to specifically address persistent challenges in textual accuracy and typography, aiming to improve the models reliability in this critical area."

Table 6 reports results obtained by fine-tuning UniWorld-V1 on incrementally larger samples drawn from our dataset; the measurements consistently indicate performance growth with increasing data volume, reinforcing the importance of dataset size in enabling stronger generalization. In parallel, Table 5 presents comprehensive evaluation on GEdit-Bench, which demonstrates that UniWorld-V1 attains state-of-the-art results among closed-source systems on representative editing tasks, including color change and tone transfer. Similarly, on the DPG-Bench, the fine-tuned Harmon model achieves the best performance, as shown in Table4. Moreover, the same fine-tuning protocol yields marked improvements for the remaining models considered, suggesting that the gains are not confined to specific models or benchmarks but instead reflect stronger generalization capacity. In terms of the unified Table 6: Data scaling results on GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, obtained by randomly sampling datasets of different sizes.

Specifically, we employed UniWorld-V1 distributions to finetune both the generation and editing components. As summarized in Table 7, our dataset consistently outperforms ShareGPT4o in both generation and editing tasks. This advantage can be attributed to our meticulous categorization, the diversity of editing instructions, and the high-quality editing outcomes. B.2 Supplementary Qualitative Experiments Qualitative results for generation are shown in Figure 5, with analysis in Section 4.3. For the editing task, beyond the qualitative example in Figure 6 (which shows the model simultaneously removing laptop and adding light blue sofa), we also present comprehensive quantitative study. This study, covering multiple editing types like Add Subject and Change Background, indicates that fine-tuning improves not only editing performance but also image fidelity. Moreover, for hybrid instructions, our dataset enhances the models ability to follow complex, compositional directives. B.3 Supplementary Quantitative Experiments on Unified dataset We further compare unified training with separate training for generation and editing. As shown in Table 8, for image editing, separate fine-tuning surpasses unified training on ImgEdit-Bench, whereas unified training outperforms separate fine-tuning on GEdit-Bench. For image generation, separate fine-tuning performs on par with unified training on GenEval-Bench, but surpasses it on DPG-Bench. These results suggest benchmark-dependent trade-off between unified and task-specific training, indicating potential task interference and underscoring the importance of tailored optimization for different evaluation regimes."

            "content": "C.1 Data Curation and Quality Control Strategy primary challenge in curating our dataset is ensuring high fidelity to complex, compositional instructions. While frontier models like GPT-4o consistently produce aesthetically pleasing images, their instruction-following capabilities often degrade when faced with highly complex prompts demanding adherence to numerous fine-grained details. This limitation is also prevalent in existing open-source models. Consequently, simple post-hoc filtering strategy proved ineffective, as high aesthetic quality is often poor proxy for semantic correctness and instruction-following accuracy. To address this, we adopted proactive quality control strategy centered on meticulous, fine-grained data curation prior to generation. Our methodology is guided by two core principles: Hierarchical Categorization. We first establish clear hierarchy by defining distinct modules (e.g., Style Control, Spatial Reasoning) and then partitioning them into more granular, well-defined sub-classes. This ensures thematic coherence and targeted data collection. 17 Table 8: Comparison of fine-tuning performance on UniWorld-V1 across different training strategies.

Within each category, we carefully calibrate the task difficulty to occupy specific sweet spot. The instructions are designed to be challenging for current open-source models yet demonstrably solvable by state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o. This principled approach ensures that our dataset is not only of high visual quality but is also semantically accurate, posing meaningful and well-defined challenge for advancing model capabilities. 18 Figure 5: Qualitative comparison of Harmon before and after fine-tuning on our dataset.
