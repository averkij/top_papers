            "content": "Phones are the smallest units of sound in speech. Unlike graphemes, phones are shared across languages and usually represented using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) (International Phonetic Association, 1999), unified transcription standard for all languages. By providing consistent representation of speech across languages, phone-level modeling allows fine-grained analysis and cross-lingual generalization, enabling tasks like atypical speech analysis (e.g., L2 speech (Li et al., 2016; Inceoglu et al., 2023) and pathological speech (Choi et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025)), endangered language documentation (He et al., 2024), code-switched text-to-speech (Zhou et al., 2020), and cross-lingual transfer in speech-to-text (Pratap et al., 2024; Magoshi et al., 2025). 1https://github.com/espnet 2https://huggingface.co/espnet/powsm 1 Figure 1: POWSM is the first phonetic foundation model that can perform four phone-related tasks: Phone Recognition (PR), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), audio-guided grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and audio-guided phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (P2G). Four key phone-related tasks underpin phonetic spoken language processing: automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (P2G). ASR learns implicit phonetic representations (Belinkov and Glass, 2017), while PR offers explicit phonelevel supervision. G2P and P2G bridge orthographic and phonetic spaces. Collectively, these tasks interact through shared phonetic representations, each addressing different aspect of the relationship between audio, phones, phonemes, and graphemes. Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have traditionally been developed in isolation, using task-specific architectures and datasets. Such systems are optimized for specific input-output mappings and cannot be easily extended to other phonetic tasks. This fragmentation has hindered the development of general-purpose models for phonetic processing, necessitating unified phonetic foundation model that can perform multiple phonerelated tasks within single, general framework for speech processing. To bridge this gap, we propose POWSM, phonetic foundation model capable of performing four core phone-related tasks PR, ASR, audio-guided G2P, and audio-guided P2G within one unified architecture (Figure 1). To construct this framework, we reformulate standard ASR datasets (Zhu et al., 2025) into four task-specific formats, allowing the model to learn consistent mappings across audio, phoneme, and grapheme representations. In addition, POWSM adopts an attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) architecture, following the design of large-scale speech foundation models such as Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) and OWSM (Peng et al., 2023). Empirically, POWSM outperforms previous PR models on both in-domain data and out-of-domain languages, achieves low-resource ASR performance comparable to web-scale multilingual foundation models, and can act as speech-grounded P2G and G2P across more than 70 languages. POWSM offers new unified paradigm for phonelevel modeling, paving the way for inclusive and globally accessible speech technologies that transcend language boundaries and resource disparities. To summarize, our main contributions are: We provide POWSM, large-scale foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art PR performance, and is capable of performing multiple fundamental phone-related tasks. Our model enables seamless conversion between speech, text (graphemes/orthography), and phones. We thoroughly analyze POWSM to understand the interaction between multiple tasks, architecture components, and losses. We fully open-source all our data preparation and evaluation scripts, model checkpoints and code to foster open science."

            "content": "Speech foundation models Recent speech foundation models such as Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) and OWSM (Peng et al., 2023, 2024) have driven progress in large-scale multilingual ASR and speech translation, but they do not explicitly address phoneme recognition or articulatory-level supervision. Subsequent work (Yusuyin et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2025) showed that incorporating phoneme-level objectives improves ASR for lowresource and long-tailed settings, while outputting phonemes as an intermediate benefited speech translation (Gállego et al., 2025). POWSM extends this line of work by being the first open foundation model jointly trained on phone recognition and related tasks, integrating multilinguality, phonetic supervision, and multi-task scalability within one framework. Phone recognition Prior work in multilingual phone recognition can broadly be categorized into (1) language-specific models (Gao et al., 2021) that rely on explicit phoneme (Xu et al., 2022) or allophone inventories (Li et al., 2020) and (2) languageagnostic approaches that aim to generalize across languages without such resources (Taguchi et al., 2023; Glocker et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2025). POWSM follows the latter paradigm as fully data-driven multilingual model that learns phone representations without predefined phoneme mappings. WhisperPPT (Samir et al., 2025) improved Whisper (Radford et al., 2023)s performance through data cleaning but remained limited in data coverage and task diversity. However, Whisper is trained on closed corpus and could display harmful biases for PR which cannot be fully removed by finetuning. POWSM is trained from scratch on open datasets. ZIPA (Zhu et al., 2025) scaled PR to 17,000+ hours of data and 88 languages using Zipformer (Yao et al., 2024) encoder and noisy-student training on 4,000+ languages, achieving state-of-the-art results. To construct its training corpus, ZIPA employed G2P system to convert large-scale ASR transcriptions into phoneme sequences, effectively repurposing ASR datasets for PR. Building on this idea, POWSM leverages both the grapheme and the G2P-generated phoneme transcriptions, reformulating them into four task-specific forms: ASR, PR, G2P, and P2G. G2P & P2G POWSM is the first model capable of both audio-guided G2P and audio-guided P2G. G2P conversion, sometimes called phonemization in the text-to-speech literature, can be accomplished with pronunciation dictionaries (Rudnicky, 1993), rules (Mortensen et al., 2018), WFSTs (Black and Lenzo, 2001), or seq2seq neural methods to choose between different pronunciations of word in context (Zhu et al., 2022). Textbased G2P, however, still cannot handle phonetic 2 variation, enforcing one-to-one mapping between orthography and transcription. In contrast, audioguided G2P can learn to map the different acoustic realizations of phoneme across varieties of language to phone representation (Route et al., 2019). In particular, Mak et al. (2025) observed performance improvement in using audio-guided G2P versus text-based G2P alone for Cantonese. Gao et al. (2024) similarly showed that joint learning of G2P, phone recognition, and forced alignment outperform G2P teacher model. Similarly, Sun and Richmond (2024) jointly learned G2P and TTS. Compared to G2P, P2G conversion is less studied, with Lauc (2024) training seq2seq model on 19 million language-grapheme-phoneme triplets."

It is an open source corpus of roughly 17,000 hours of multilingual speech with paired orthographic and phonemic transcriptions. We will release all data processing scripts to make POWSM fully reproducible. G2P-generated transcriptions have been manually inspected and cleaned. Following Samir et al. (2025), we remove Interlingua and 10 noisy FLEURS languages. Utterances longer than 300 phones are filtered out. IPA sequences are normalized to Unicode NFD (Canonical Decomposition); English G2P sequences are further refined with rule-based corrections to fix voice-onset time issues (see Appendix A.1). To prevent IPA tokens from being confused with graphemes, sequences are split into phone tokens with diacritics and modifiers attached, following PanPhon (Mortensen et al., 2016), and enclosed in slashes (e.g., /phOs@m/ /ph/ /O/ /s/ /@/ /m/)."

            "content": "POWSM adopts an attention-based encoderdecoder (AED) architecture, which flexibly models output sequences and allows the integration of additional tasks. Specifically, we follow the OWSM v3.1 architecture (Peng et al., 2024), which employs an E-Branchformer encoder and Transformer decoder, consistent with the general encoder-decoder structure of Whisper (Radford et al., 2023). The model is trained from scratch using ESPnet (Watanabe et al., 2018) with hybrid CTC/attention loss (Watanabe et al., 2017), where we set the ratio αctc to 0.3: = αctcLctc + (1 αctc)Lattention. (1) The encoder operates at the stride size of 40ms. Training uses global batch size of 256. Speech inputs are 16kHz and padded to 20 seconds. The vocabulary consists of 40k tokens, including around 6k phone tokens, language and timestamp tokens, and BPE tokens from orthography. The model has approximately 350M parameters with 9 layers for both the encoder and decoder and was trained on 4 H100 GPUs for 2 days. Using CTC loss (Graves, 2006), We align the encoder outputs with simplified version of the phone token sequences. Unlike the decoder outputs, the phones in these sequences are stripped of break (/./, /</) and length diacritics (/e:/, /e;/, /ˇe/) to accelerate convergence. Additional details and analyses are provided in 6.1."

Each utterance is used once per task, with task-specific formatting as illustrated in Figure 1, including text prompt, language token, task token, and target output. We leave the text prompt blank (token <na>) for PR and ASR, and provide graphemes and phones as prompts for G2P and P2G. PFER = 1 #phone (cid:88) i=1 D(feat(hypi), feat(refi)) (2) Unlike Phone Error Rate (PER), which considers only exact phone matches, or Phone Token Error Rate (PTER), which treats diacritics and modifiers as separate tokens, PFER computes the edit distance in terms of articulatory features interpretable subphone attributes (e.g. voicing) 3 capturing phonetic similarity in fine-grained fashion. Previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2025) define PFER as the mean articulatory feature edit distance over the evaluation set. In contrast, we normalize it by the number of phones in the reference transcription to measure the proportion of feature errors per phone. Decoding hyperparameters We use CTC weight (denoted as ctc) of 0.3 and beam size (denoted as beam) of 3 during decoding for all reported numbers unless specified. Further details on the choice of hyperparameters are discussed in 6.1. Evaluation datasets For unseen languages, we evaluate on three datasets: DoReCo (Paschen et al., 2020), VoxAngeles (Chodroff et al., 2024), and Tusom2021 (Mortensen et al., 2021). DoReCo is dataset of 50+ languages (with broad transcriptions) intended for documentation of small or endangered languages; we use 45-language subset. VoxAngeles (Chodroff et al., 2024) is postprocessed version of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive (Ladefoged et al., 2009) containing 95 languages. Tusom is low-data Tangkhulic language of India not included in the training data. Tusom2021 consists of narrow phonetic transcriptions (unlike the broad transcriptions from G2P on which POWSM was trained) of individual Tusom words. We removed the tones. We also test on five datasets on varieties of English: the Buckeye Corpus (Pitt et al., 2005) and DoReCo South-England represent dialectal variation, while L2-ARCTIC (Zhao et al., 2018), EpaDB (Vidal et al., 2019), and SpeechOcean762 (Zhang et al., 2021) contain L2 speakers. For L2-ARCTIC, we used the manually annotated phoneme transcriptions (which Zhu et al. (2025) termed L2Perceived) rather than G2P dictionary-based transcriptions. The manual transcriptions reflect what the speaker actually said, whereas the dictionarybased version enforces single pronunciation variant.3 Manual inspection by trained phonologist further showed the L2-ARCTIC transcriptions to be of extremely poor quality. For the five aforementioned datasets, we use preprocessed datasets 3For instance, crayon in American English can be pronounced as /\"kôæn/, /\"kôej.On/, or /\"kôej.6n/ (Vaux and Golder, 2003) (among others), but the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (Rudnicky, 1993) only lists one. from Zhu et al. (2025)4 and Koel Labs5 for better transcription quality. We then evaluated our model on in-domain data from IPAPack++, the dataset seen during training. We followed Zhu et al. (2025) in using LibriSpeech for English, AISHELL for Mandarin, and MLS for European languages, and additionally evaluated on IISc-MILE Tamil (A et al., 2022) for Tamil and KSC (Khassanov et al., 2021) for Kazakh. For ASR and P2G, we evaluate with FLEURS. See Table 1 for more details about our evaluation datasets.

See Appendix A.2 for more details about training data and language coverage. Allosaurus (Li et al., 2020, 2021) uses phone-level CTC to train language-agnostic model and applies language-specific allophone-to-phoneme mappings. Wav2Vec2Phoneme (Xu et al., 2022), MultIPA (Taguchi et al., 2023) and Allophant (Glocker et al., 2023) fine-tune XLS-R (Babu et al., 2022) with different objectives: Wav2Vec2Phoneme maps unseen phonemes using articulatory features, MultIPA leverages high-quality G2P data from seven languages, while Allophant decomposes phones into articulatory features and applies CTC losses for each. ZIPA (Zhu et al., 2025) trains ZipFormer 4https://huggingface.co/anyspeech 5https://huggingface.co/KoelLabs 4 (Yao et al., 2024) from scratch on IPAPack++ using CR-CTC and also provides variant trained with additional pseudo-labeled data (ZIPA-CRNS-Large). For ASR, we compare POWSM with two series of models: OWSM (Peng et al., 2025) and OWLS (Chen et al., 2025). We select OWSM-CTC v4 because it is the best-performing model in the series, featuring an encoder-CTC architecture that supports ASR, ST, and LID. For OWLS, we include models with comparable parameter sizes."

            "content": "Results on the in-domain test sets are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. We provide further discussion of G2P and P2G in 6.2. POWSM excels at in-domain phone recognition From Table 2, we see that POWSM achieves the lowest average PFER in phone recognition, due to the strong language modeling capability of the decoder. We hypothesize that our English data cleaning (Appendix A.1) may have negatively affected the PFER for Germanic languages due to mismatch between training and test data. Nevertheless, our approach fills this gap by achieving strong performance on other languages, outperforming models trained on larger datasets. POWSM is comparable with web-scale ASR models on low-resource languages We hypothesize that pre-training with phone recognition benefits low-resource ASR (Yusuyin et al., 2025). To choose low-resource languages, we selected languages in IPAPack++ with less than 8 hours of speech in FLEURS to serve as the test set. See A.3 for details on the amount of data used by different models. For fair comparison with other multilingual ASR baselines without languagespecific components, we use the same decoding hyperparameters ctc=0.0, beam=1. As shown in Table 3, POWSM (POWSM 0.35B, ASR) is often comparable to models of similar size trained on web-scale data for ASR (OWLS 0.5B). Incorporating phones obtained from PR as text prompts (PR-P2G) significantly decreases WER, making it comparable to or even better than these models. When using gold phone labels for P2G (see analysis in 6.2), POWSM outperforms other ASR models by large margin in most cases."

This shows the effectiveness of our multi-task approach. While POWSM lags behind Wav2Vec2Phoneme on socio-phonetic variations, we attribute this to its self-supervised learning with over 60k hours of speech (from wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020)) prior to the supervised learning stage."

Therefore, we used phones as encoder targets, encouraging general representations of sounds to be shared across languages. To determine the most effective unit for the CTC encoder, we fix the decoder vocabulary to PanPhon phones and compared four encoder targets: (1) Unicode code points vs. PanPhon, and (2) sequences with vs. without suprasegmentals (length and break marks). Unicode code points offer simplicity and smaller vocabulary but split phones into unnatural units (e.g. /ph/) and increase sequence length, while PanPhon represents each phone-diacritic combination as unit (e.g. /ph/), yielding more natural monotonic sequence at the expense of sparsity and potential out-of-vocabulary issues. Suprasegmentals such as /:/, though phonemic in many languages, confuse PR models (Zhu et al., 2025)."

Figure 2: Validation CER of encoder-CTC during training. Removing suprasegmentals for CTC accelerates convergence and reduces vocabulary size for encoder. We run small-scale experiments on 1k-hour subset of the multi-task data (250 hours of speech repeated across four tasks). We use the validation CER of the encoder-CTC output as proxy for training efficiency. An earlier drop indicates that the encoder is learning useful alignment early, which improves representations fed into the decoder and accelerates overall convergence. In Figure 2, PanPhon tokenization without suprasegmentals shows the earliest drop, suggesting that alignment with decoder units aids training, while collapsing suprasegmental distinctions for CTC reduces confusion. Increased encoder weights benefit PR on out-ofdomain data As in other encoder-decoder models (Gong et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2023), we expect the encoder of POWSM to capture more general acoustic patterns, while the decoder handles language and task-specific output formats. Therefore, we investigate whether emphasizing the encoder more during different stages of model development affects performance. To balance data diversity with inference compute costs, we selected two smaller datasets from each category with distinct characteristics. As shown in Table 5, higher CTC decoding weights improve PR performance on out-of-domain data but degrade it on in-domain data, as expected. This echoes Zhu et al. (2025)s finding that RNN-T (Graves and Jaitly, 2014), an encoder-only speechto-text model with an autoregressive text prediction network, hurts generalization to unseen patterns of phones (phonotactics). We hypothesize that the decoder is performing implicit language modeling and smooths phonetic variation, as Zhu et al. (2025) described. Next, we examine whether focusing more on the CTC loss through training widens this gap in performance between in-domain and out-of-domain data. We find that fine-tuning with higher CTC loss weight αctc after convergence does not improve outof-domain performance and can even degrade it. Randomly varying αctc for each batch also shows no improvement. In contrast, training with higher αctc from the start benefits the out-of-domain distribution, achieving the lowest PFER on unseen languages with greedy decoding, while the PFER on in-domain data is comparatively higher. These results suggest that assigning higher weight to the encoder during training and inference improves PR, highlighting common trade-off between indomain performance and generalization. 6."

Blue for correctly capturing mispronounced parts (/soU/), orange for error compared to other examples. vary the G2P conditions from purely speech-based to purely text-based, as shown in Table 6, and evaluate the model on the Buckeye dataset. When only speech is provided, the performance is comparable to the PR setting, which differs only in the task token. Adding both speech and text prompts (the standard G2P setup) leads to degraded performance, with output showing standardized pronunciations. When the model relies solely on the text prompt, performance drops sharply and pronunciations become highly standardized as expected (just as Zhu et al. (2025) reported). In other words, POWSM G2P responds to 7 speech and text signals to controllably mediate between narrow and broad transcription. In the multi-task setup, this effect may be stronger because the model is trained with G2P, which could bias it toward more standardized forms. Audio-P2G effectively handles low-resource languages We compare several P2G setups on the same set of low-resource languages from FLEURS, listed in Table 7. P2G significantly outperforms ASR, suggesting that it effectively leverages the provided phone context. However, since P2G uses gold phone labels, this comparison is not entirely fair. We therefore tested PR followed by P2G (PRP2G), and found that performance improved for some languages but not for others. Error propagation does not explain this variation in performance, as PFER trends from PR differ from the observed performance drops. Yet the PFER pattern aligns closely with ASR results, suggesting that phonotactic similarity to high-resource languages may play role. To test this, we run P2G with the language code set to English and post-process the output to match Cyrillic or Gurmukhi transcriptions with online conversion tools for certain languages.6 This approach often outperforms ASR and sometimes approaches P2Gs performance, indicating that P2G also relies heavily on speech input. Languages with either comparibly low or high PFER did not benefit from this transliteration approach, possibly because the model already handled them well or had not yet learned them sufficiently. This finding suggests direction for further investigation in low-resource ASR.

Our model achieves state-of-theart performance on PR while also supporting ASR across more than 70 languages. Beyond PR and ASR, the models ability to perform audio-guided G2P and P2G enables applications that require finegrained linguistic analysis such as atypical speech assessment. Our analysis reveals that POWSMs encoder benefits from phoneme-level CTC supervision and stronger encoder weighting, enhanc8 ing cross-lingual generalization. Additionally, the model demonstrates interpretable multimodal and language-aware behaviors, effectively mediating between phonetic detail and standardized phonological patterns. To conclude, POWSM not only provides strong phone recognition foundation model for high-resource languages, but also acts as versatile resource for unseen languages and socio-phonetic variation."

In the future, we seek to adapt to socio-phonetic variation either through (unsupervised) test-time adaptation (Lin et al., 2022), in-context learning (Roll et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024), or mechanistic interpretability (Tang et al., 2024). Furthermore, since Shim et al.

First, the model is neither strictly phonemic nor phonetic: its training data consist of cleaned and filtered phonemic transcriptions from multiple languages, which are not fully faithful to the phonetic or phonemic structure of the audio. Although phonemic transcriptions share similarities across languages, adding auxiliary tasks and language tokens may have reinforced language-specific biases. We also currently lack sufficient allophone-level data, which would provide more language-independent information. Second, the model still favors high-resource languages. Since we include decoder for language modeling and language tokens, both of which function effectively, the model would inherently bias toward the seen distribution. Finally, the current AED architecture imposes engineering limitations. Inference is significantly slower than with encoder-only models, and the architecture does not easily support tone modeling, limiting its application to tonal languages."

We also acknowledge that accurate modeling of socio-phonetic variation can enable demographic inference, as demographics and phonetic variation are deeply intertwined (Labov, 1963). We stress that uses of POWSM must align with our vision: future where advances in spoken language processing and NLP do not leave low-resource varieties behind."

In Proc. Interspeech 2021, pages 37103714. 11 lowest-resource languages to exclude any that may have other substantial sources not included in IPAPack++. This process leaves us with nine languages. We finally exclude ell, as it is comparatively higher-resource and because there are already three other Balto-Slavic languages. Note that other models use strictly more data than oursnot only in terms of dataset count but also because IPAPack++ applies additional data-quality filtering. Table 10 lists the amount of ASR training data for baselines. A.4 Multi-tasking at Different Scales Multi-tasking may improve performance by tying acoustic signals to well-defined symbolic representations, yet it may distract the model if the relationships are not learned effectively. We train POWSM with different data and model scales to examine how multitask learning interacts with the setup, and use beam=1 during decoding to speed up inference. Table 11 shows that there is no clear trend regarding whether multitasking benefits PR performance. PR performance degrades when the model has excessive capacity relative to the available data (too little data), or when it is limited by size (too much data). Further evidence is needed before concluding that phoneme recognition benefits less from scaling, as we currently lack sufficient data and large model capacity to test this thoroughly. Nevertheless, the model demonstrates the ability to multitask, which represents promising direction for future work.

            "content": "A.1 Refining English G2P We observed confusion in plosive voice-onset times on unseen languages in preliminary experiments, which is likely from English G2P data. For instance, broad phonemic transcription in English typically uses /b/ to transcribe the /b/ in /bat/, but its voice onset timing is actually voiceless in Mainstream American English and is closer to [p]. To mitigate this, we apply rule-based refinements to English G2P transcriptions, adjusting plosive voicing and aspiration, lateral velarization, and vowel nasalization. The rules are listed below: 1) word-initial voiceless plosives (/p/, /t/, /k/) are aspirated, 2) wordinitial voiced plosives (/b/, /d/, /g/) are voiceless, 3) lateral /l/ is velarized at the end of syllables, and 4) vowel nasalization before nasal consonants. A.2 Baseline Implementation We provide the baselines training data source, number of languages covered in the data, and links to model checkpoints or repository in Table 9. A.3 FLEURS language selection for ASR We first filter out languages with more than 8 hours of training data in IPAPack++ (Zhu et al., 2025), keeping only those that are also present in FLEURS. Then, following the training data amounts reported in Chen et al. (2025), we further identify the"
