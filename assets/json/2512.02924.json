            "content": "Visionlanguage models (VLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] have fundamentally advanced the capability to jointly reason over images and text, achieving remarkable success in recognition, grounding, captioning, Correspondence author and visual instruction following. The dominant paradigm typically grafts pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) onto decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) via projection layer, aligning the modalities through visual instruction tuning. While this GPU-centric design yields high accuracy at large resolutions, it introduces systemic inefficiencies when deployed on edge devices. Specifically, it suffers from: (i) high inference latency, dominated by the heavy computational cost of vision encoding and the autoregressive generation of the LLM (affecting both time-to-first-token and time-per-token); and (ii) inherent brittleness under low-precision execution, owing to the attention-heavy architectures in both vision and language components that are sensitive to quantization. Why NPUs change the design space. Neural Processing Units (NPUs) [6, 7, 8] have emerged as the default compute substrate for mobile and edge intelligence, delivering high TOPS and energy efficiency through specialized integer operators and on-chip SRAM. However, state-of-the-art VLMs optimized for floating-point GPU execution often degrade significantly under NPU-friendly INT-x quantization constraints. We identify two root causes for this hardwaresoftware mismatch. First, Vision Transformers (ViTs) [9, 10] exhibit quantization brittlenessactivations and weights in multi-head attention and RMSNorm [11] paths often possess outlier distributions that are sensitive to low-precision scaling, leading to sharp accuracy collapse at INT8/16. Second, Transformer-based language backbones suffer from memory I/O bottlenecks. The autoregressive generation process necessitates repeated Key-Value (KV) cache access, creating memory-bound operations that saturate on-chip bandwidth. Consequently, the NPUs compute units stall despite high nominal TOPS, inflating latency and reducing end-to-end throughput. Prefilling time dominates user-perceived latency. For interactive VLMs, system responsiveness is primarily governed by Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), which aggregates the latency of the vision encoder and the LLM prefilling phase across all input tokens. As input resolution or tiling strategies scale up to improve visual fidelity, the number of visual tokens increases quadratically, disproportionately elongating the prefilling phase. Consequently, the conventional strategy of scaling ViT width or depth yields diminishing returns on NPUs: marginal accuracy gains are negated by non-linear growth in TTFT and heightened sensitivity to quantization errors. NPU-native co-design. We posit that achieving robust, low-latency multi-modal intelligence at the edge necessitates an NPU-native co-design approach across two dimensions: (1) Topology: Replacing global attention mechanisms with operatorand memory-efficient components that naturally stabilize INT-x inference and minimize memory traffic; (2) Runtime: Implementing scheduling strategies that respect NPU buffer hierarchies and bandwidth limits, constraining peak activation footprints and KV cache overhead to optimize both TTFT and generation speed. Our approach. We introduce AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture that fundamentally rethinks vision encoding and language modeling for edge efficiency. For the vision encoder, we depart from standard ViTs in favor of MobileNet-style architecture utilizing depthwise separable convolutions. This design eliminates the quadratic complexity and quantization brittleness of global attention, providing strong inductive biases for feature extraction while maintaining bounded activation distributions inherently stable for INT8/16 inference. For the language backbone, we adopt hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture (inspired by Liquid AI principles), which interleaves Transformer layers with efficient gated convolutions based on structural state-space models. This topology offers linear-time complexity and compact state representations, obviating the need for explicit KV caching and reducing memory I/O by up to 60% during generation. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify convolution-based visual stability with linear-complexity state-space modeling, effectively decoupling multi-modal reasoning capability from the heavy computational burden of global attention. We couple this architecture with an NPU-aware training recipe that integrates quantization-aware fine-tuning (QAT) [12, 13, 14], mixed-precision constraints, and hardware-aligned calibration. Key findings. Our architecture yields up to 7 lower quantization error and 14 lower endto-end latency versus ViT-Transformer baselines under the same NPU precision constraints. The MobileNet encoder contributes to stable INT8/16 inference with minimal quantization degradation, while the Liquid AI backbone reduces memory I/O by up to 60% during autoregressive generation. Hardware measurements on commercial automotive SoC (Qualcomm SA8295P NPU) show realtime responsiveness in an in-car assistant scenario (Figure 2), validating that both TTFT and time-per2 Figure 1: Architecture overview of AutoNeural.

            "content": "Our work sits at the intersection of three research areas: multimodal models for automotive applications, NPU-optimized inference, and efficient vision encoders for on-device deployment. Multimodal models for automotive deployment. The automotive industry has increasingly adopted visionlanguage models to enable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), in-car assistants, and autonomous driving capabilities [15, 16]. Recent work has explored the application of large multimodal models in automotive contexts, ranging from scenario generation to real-time perception. For instance, multimodal LLMs [17, 1]have been applied to autonomous driving tasks such as scenario generation and perception, demonstrating the potential of integrating visual and textual reasoning for improved situational awareness[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, most of these systems rely on GPU-based inference and have not been optimized for the power and latency constraints of invehicle NPUs. The deployment of such models in production vehicles requires careful co-design with 3 edge hardware, gap our work directly addresses. While existing automotive multimodal systems often compromise on model capacity or resolution to meet latency budgets, our MobileNet-Hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture demonstrates that hardware-aware design enables both high accuracy and low latency. Models on NPU architectures. Neural Processing Units from vendors such as Qualcomm [23, 24], MediaTek [25], and Apple have become the primary compute substrate for on-device AI across mobile and automotive platforms. Recent efforts have focused on adapting large multimodal models for NPU deployment through quantization [26, 27], pruning [28], and operator fusion [29]. For example, work on Qualcomm platforms [30, 31, 32, 33] has demonstrated that quantization-aware training and low-rank factorization can accelerate inference while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Similarly, frameworks like MindVL [34] have explored efficient training pipelines on Ascend NPUs, integrating distributed data loading and system-level scheduling. MiniCPM-V [35, 36] represents another line of work targeting edge deployment through aggressive model compression, achieving strong performance on mobile devices. However, these approaches primarily focus on post-hoc optimization of GPU-first architectures rather than fundamental architectural redesign. In contrast, our work rethinks both the vision encoder and language backbone to match NPU operator sets and memory hierarchies, yielding more substantial latency and efficiency gains. Efficient vision encoders for on-device deployment. The choice of vision encoder critically impacts both accuracy and deployment efficiency in multimodal systems. While Vision Transformers have dominated recent VLM architectures due to their strong performance, their global attention mechanisms and quantization brittleness pose significant challenges for on-device deployment. Recent work has explored alternative encoder designs optimized for edge scenarios. MobileNet architectures [37, 38, 39, 40], originally designed for efficient image classification, employ depthwise separable convolutions that reduce parameter count and computation while maintaining strong inductive biases for visual features. Notably, PaliGemma [41, 42], recent 3B parameter VLM from Google, demonstrates that carefully designed smaller vision encoders can achieve competitive transfer performance. Beyond vision encoders, recent advances in sequence modeling have introduced State Space Models (SSMs) [43, 44, 45, 46]as efficient alternatives to Transformers for language modeling. SSMs achieve linear-time complexity through selective state spaces and eliminate the need for explicit key-value caching, making them particularly attractive for memory-constrained NPU deployment. Building on these principles, Liquid Foundation Models [47, 48, 49] demonstrate efficient sequence modeling architectures that combine linear-time complexity with strong representational capacity through liquid structural state-space modeling. Our work adopts the Liquid AI architecture as our language backbone and systematically pairs it with MobileNet-based encoder optimized for NPUaware quantization. By replacing global attention in both the vision and language components, we address the dual bottlenecks of quantization brittleness and memory I/O that plague existing VLM architectures on NPUs."

            "title": "3.1 Model Architecture",
            "content": "Vision encoder Our vision encoder builds on MobileNetV5, exploiting depthwise separable convolutions for efficient feature extraction with bounded activations, and is initialized from the Gemma 3n-E4B vision checkpoint to align with the multimodal design of Gemma 3n [50, 51]. It consumes 768768 inputs and produces spatial feature map that is flattened into visual tokens. In contrast to ViTs with global self-attention, we employ hierarchical stack of inverted residual (IR) blocks that naturally yields multi-scale features while preserving local receptive fields; this local-first design reduces quantization sensitivity, as convolution + normalization maintain stabler activation ranges than LayerNorm and multi-head attention, improving INT8/16 robustness. The network begins with 33 stride-2 stem, followed by four stages in which stride-2 IR blocks 4 downsample and stride-1 IR blocks refine. To inject long-range context at bounded cost, the late, low-resolution stages interleave sparse multi-query attention (MQA) bottlenecks. We aggregate information via Multi-Scale Fusion Adapter (MSFA): the last two stage outputs are upsampled to the finest tapped resolution, channel-concatenated, and processed by universal inverted residual layer (pointwisedepthwisepointwise) with GELU (tanh) activations and RMSNorm; 33 stride-3 average pool yields fused 16162048 tensor. This spatial feature map is then flattened into 256 visual tokens, where each of the 1616 spatial locations becomes token with 2048-dimensional features, balancing fidelity and LLM prefill cost while preserving accuracy and latency benefits. Vision-Language connector The vision-language connector serves as the alignment bridge between the visual encoders output space and the language models embedding space, transforming the visual token representations produced by the MobileNet encoder into the token embeddings expected by the language model backbone. Our connector architecture employs lightweight two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Units) activation between the hidden layer. This design deviates from the Gemma 3n-E4B projector, which incorporates two RMSNorm layers within the projection path. We deliberately avoid normalization layers in the connector to maintain NPU quantization robustness. Contemporary NPU quantization pipelines rely on static per-tensor quantization, where activation ranges must be determined at calibration time and fixed during deployment. RMSNorm introduces significant quantization challenges: its dynamic scaling operationcomputing the root-mean-square over features at each positionproduces activations with input-dependent distributions that are difficult to calibrate accurately with static ranges. Language model backbone For the language model, we adopt the Liquid AI 1.2B parameter architecture, hybrid design that strategically interleaves Transformer self-attention layers with efficient sequence modeling layers based on liquid structural state-space principles. The sequence modeling layers implement gated convolutions with depthwise short-kernel operations, providing linear-time complexity during inference while maintaining compact state representations that avoid explicit key-value cache overhead. The Liquid AI architecture employs 5:3 ratio with 16 total layers10 layers use gated-convolution sequence modeling while 6 layers use Transformer selfattention. This design is particularly well-suited for NPU deployment for two reasons: (1) the convolution-based layers provide linear-time complexity during autoregressive generation, eliminating the quadratic scaling of attention and dramatically reducing memory footprint, and (2) the preserved Transformer layers maintain strong in-context learning and reasoning capabilities essential for visionlanguage tasks. The gated-convolution layers maintain rolling state cache that operates with bounded memory during inference, requiring only fixed-size context window rather than the full key-value history. During generation, this hybrid design reduces memory bandwidth pressure on the NPU by up to 60% compared to pure Transformer baseline, as the majority of layers avoid explicit KV cache reads/writes. Each sequence modeling layer is followed by feed-forward network with SwiGLU activation, with RMSNorm applied before both types of layers to stabilize training and maintain activation distributions suitable for quantization. The complete architecture is illustrated in Figure 1."

Edge-deployed multimodal models enable diverse interaction scenarios critical for driving safety and user experience. These include real-time interpretation of dashboard indicators and warning lights with actionable recommendations based on vehicle sensor data. Scene understanding for navigation assistance under 6 challenging conditions, such as nighttime or adverse weather when visibility is compromised, and interpretation of traffic signs and road conditions through external cameras help prevent navigation errors. The system also supports analysis of documents captured via in-cabin cameras, multimodal interaction combining gesture recognition with voice commands for hands-free operation, and driver state monitoring to detect fatigue or anxiety and provide timely interventions through environmental adjustments. Unlike general-purpose VLMs, automotive cockpit AI faces stringent deployment constraints. Latency requirements demand responses within milliseconds to maintain driver attention and safety, while strict power budgets are dictated by vehicle electrical systems. Furthermore, cockpit deployments must maintain robustness across extreme environmental conditions including varying illumination from direct sunlight to nighttime darkness, temperature fluctuations ranging from sub-zero to high heat, mechanical vibration, and diverse user populations with different interaction patterns. These constraints necessitate NPU-native architectures that deliver consistent low-latency performance under quantized inference while maintaining high accuracy across automotive-specific visual and linguistic domains."

Stage 1: Image-text association learning. In the first stage, we freeze both the vision encoder and the language model, training only the vision-language projection layer to establish basic image-text associations. We use high-quality image-caption pairs from Infinity-MM to optimize next-token prediction objective where the model learns to generate captions conditioned on visual tokens. This stage runs for 1 epoch with learning rate of 1e-3, using AdamW optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and cosine learning rate schedule with warmup. The effective batch size is set to 512 with gradient accumulation. Stage 2: General visual task training. In the second stage, we unfreeze all parameters including both the vision encoder and language model, and train on general visual understanding tasks including object recognition, scene understanding, and basic visual question answering. We train with learning rate of 1e-5 for 1 epoch, using the same optimizer configuration. For the first 600 training steps, batch size of 16 is adopted to mitigate gradient explosion.

This automotive dataset was collected by approximately 400 volunteers across diverse demographics to ensure generalization across varied lighting conditions, vehicle types, and user populations. We use the quantization-aware training (QAT) method to fine-tune all parameters with learning rate of 1e-5 for 1 epoch with an effective batch size of 512 using mixture that balances 60% synthetic data and 40% automotive data.

Both models are deployed with W8A16 quantization (8-bit weights, 16-bit activations) to ensure fair comparison under identical precision constraints. Our AutoNeural vision encoder (300M parameters) is compared against InternViT-300M, Vision Transformer encoder with comparable parameter count. The results reveal dramatic latency advantages across all tested resolutions. At 256256 resolution, AutoNeural achieves 28.0ms inference time compared to 163.3ms for InternViT-300M, yielding 5.8 speedup. At 512512, the gap widens substantially: AutoNeural processes images in 101.7ms while InternViT-300M requires 1415.0msa 14 speedup. Most critically, at the native 768768 resolution used in our full VLM system, AutoNeural maintains real-time performance at 278.1ms per image, whereas InternViT-300M fails to execute due to memory constraints on the NPU hardware. This inability to support high-resolution inputs fundamentally limits ViT-based architectures for automotive cockpit applications, where detailed visual understanding of dashboard indicators, traffic signs, and scene context requires processing at sufficient resolution. The latency gap stems from fundamental architectural differences. Vision Transformers employ global self-attention with quadratic complexity in the number of patches, generating large intermediate activation tensors. In contrast, our MobileNet encoders depthwise separable convolutions maintain bounded activation footprints, enable efficient NPU operator fusion, and exhibit predictable memory access patterns that maximize on-chip buffer utilization. The MSFA module further reduces latency by processing only two downsampled feature maps rather than maintaining full-resolution activations throughout the network. These results validate that NPU-native architectural choices are essential for real-time multimodal intelligence at the edge, where latency constraints are as critical as accuracy metrics. End-to-end system performance. To evaluate the complete system under realistic deployment conditions, we compare AutoNeural-VL against InternVL 2B as baseline solution on the Qualcomm SA8295P NPU. Table 2 presents comprehensive metrics including TTFT, maximum image resolution, signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR), quantization error (RMS Error), LLM Perplexity, decode throughput, and context length. AutoNeural-VL achieves full vision support with 768768 resolution compared to InternVL 2Bs 448448 limitation, enabling detailed visual understanding crucial for automotive applications. Critically, AutoNeural-VL delivers 14 faster TTFT (100ms vs 1.40s for 512512 image), demonstrating the dramatic latency improvements enabled by our NPU-native architecture. The MobileNet encoder maintains superior quantization robustness with 7 lower RMS error (0.562% vs 3.98%) and 17 dB higher SQNR (45 dB vs 28 dB), validating that it is fundamentally more stable under aggressive quantization. To further validate the language models quantization robustness, we measure perplexity on held-out test set: the Liquid AI 1.2B backbone exhibits minimal degradation from 21.13 (FP16) to 21.47 (W4A16), corresponding to only 1.6% perplexity increase under aggressive 4-bit weight quantization. This stability confirms that the hybrid 9 Figure 3: Vision encoder latency comparison on Qualcomm SA8295P NPU across three input resolutions. AutoNeurals MobileNet-based encoder achieves 5.8 speedup at 256256, 14 speedup at 512512, and successfully processes 768768 images in real-time while InternViT-300M exceeds NPU memory capacity. Lower latency is better.

These results demonstrate that NPU-native co-design delivers substantial improvements across all critical deployment metricslatency, quantization robustness, throughput, and context capacitymaking real-time automotive cockpit AI practical. Future work. The benchmark results presented in this work are conducted under full precision conditions. While we provide quantization robustness metrics through SQNR measurements for the vision encoder and perplexity analysis for the language model, comprehensive in-vehicle evaluation under real deployment conditions and exploring better quantization approaches remains essential future work. This includes validating quantized model performance across diverse driving scenarios, extending benchmarks to additional NPU platforms, conducting end-to-end quality assessment in production automotive environments, and exploring automated architecture search for hardwarespecific optimization."

            "content": "We presented NPU-native visionlanguage model architecture that fundamentally rethinks both vision encoding and language modeling for efficient edge deployment. By replacing the standard ViT-Transformer paradigm with MobileNet-based encoder and hybrid Transformer-SSM backbone, 10 we address the dual bottlenecks of quantization brittleness and memory I/O that plague existing VLM architectures on NPUs. Empirical evaluation across standard multimodal benchmarks reveals that our architecture delivers up to 7 quantization error and 14 lower end-to-end latency compared to ViTTransformer baselines under the same NPU precision constraints. The MobileNet encoder achieves stable INT8/16 inference with minimal quantization degradation, while the hybrid TransformerSSM backbone reduces memory I/O by up to 60% during autoregressive generation. Real-world deployment on the Qualcomm SA8295P NPU validates real-time responsiveness in automotive scenarios. Our work demonstrates that NPU-native co-design is essential for robust, low-latency multimodal intelligence at the edge. The conventional approach of scaling resolution and model capacity exhibits diminishing returns on NPUs, where quantization brittleness and memory bandwidth become the primary bottlenecks. By carefully selecting operators that align with NPU execution modelsdepthwise separable convolutions for vision, SSMs for languagewe unlock the full potential of edge accelerators. This principle extends beyond visionlanguage models to any multimodal architecture targeting resource-constrained deployment. Future work includes exploring automated architecture search conditioned on hardware profiles, mixed-precision quantization schemes, and validation across diverse edge accelerators to strengthen generalizability."
