Motivation Image super-resolution aims at reconstructing highresolution (HR) image from low-resolution (LR) observation. The advance of recent image processing techniques [19, 20, 31, 34, 40, 47] has enabled realistic SR models to not only super-resolve images but also restore other types of degradations in the real world, such as noise, blurriness, and compression [31, 40]. However, recent studies have still found an inconsistency between human perceptual and model quantitative evaluations, i.e. models that achieve better visual quality can easily fail under existing evaluation metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [16, 30, 34]. As result, growing distrust in existing image metrics emerges, and researchers have to conduct self-organized user studies [30, 34] or adopt varying image metrics [35, 37] to demonstrate their performances. In this paper, aside from blaming the metrics, we aim to investigate and rethink the issue, so that fair understanding of the SR evaluations can be reached and further justifications can be explored. 1 Given an output image IHR from SR model, the evaluation of IHR can be generally measured by: = D(IHR, IGT ), (1) where IGT is the GT image served as reference, and D() can be any similarity metric such as PSNR and LPIPS. Thus, the evaluation results depend both on the choice of and the quality of IGT . However, while variety of image metrics are studied, few have investigated the roles of GTs during evaluation. Thus, it remains to ask: are GTs really 100% trustworthy? Or are image metrics, not the only one responsible for the growing inconsistency between perceptual and quantitative evaluations? In Figure 1, we show GT images (center) from two SR datasets RealSR [6] and DRealSR [33]. These GTs show relatively poor quality, due to the device limitation images were captured several years ago or the lack of careful control over other types of distortions. Meanwhile, advancing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR methods (e.g. diffusion-based models [34, 37]) can remove multiple degradations and produce finer details, often producing outputs (right) that surpass the GT images in perceptual quality. As result, when applying an existing similarity metric D(), the lower-quality outputs from models (left) will instead show higher similarity to the GT, leading to contradictory evaluations that images presenting superior quality are performing worse. This observation motivates us to rethink the current de facto evaluations in SR. Thus, we investigate how the existence of unreliable GTs affects the evaluations of current SR models and how to make fair evaluations with imperfect GTs. To do so, we first test seven representative SOTA SR models on three datasets and evaluate how their performances are affected by the quality of GTs. We observe an inherent connection between model performances and GT quality despite concrete models or evaluation metrics, which sheds light on how future models and datasets should be developed. Second, we propose simple yet effective solution to correct the unfairness caused by imperfect GTs. Specifically, we propose relative IQA scheme, Relative Quality Index (RQI), to measure two arbitrary images that may have varying quality, instead of treating GT as the perfect reference. Our newly defined metric outperforms existing IQA metrics on both user-based opinions and public benchmarks. In summary, the main contributions of this paper include: We point out the existence of imperfect GTs in current widely used SR datasets and then systematically analyze how GT quality affects model evaluations, demonstrating the inherent connection between model performance and GT quality, and providing valuable insights into the future development of models and datasets. We propose novel perceptual quality metric, RQI, to improve SR evaluations with unreliable GTs. RQI assesses relative quality discrepancies between image pairs, regardless of their quality levels, addressing the limitations of poor GTs. Experimental results on both user opinions and public benchmarks demonstrate its superiority. 2. Related Work 2.1. Image super-resolution Image super-resolution reconstructs HR images from LR inputs, serving as cornerstone for medical imaging, satellite analysis, video enhancement, etc. [811, 13, 14, 19, 20, 30, 31, 34, 37, 40, 45, 46, 48]. Early approaches [8, 11, 13, 14, 20, 47] operate under the assumption of predefined degradation process, such as bicubic downsampling or blurring with known prior. However, their effectiveness is often constrained in real-world scenarios where noise or compression artifacts may occur. To handle practical SR, BSRGAN [40] and RealESRGAN [31] assume complex degradation in LR images and adversarially train models to remove multiple degradations. Transformer-based methods further improve HR quality by capturing long dependencies between pixels: SwinIR [19] utilizes window attention in Swin Transformer [22] for global dependencies, while HAT [9] optimizes hierarchical feature integration. With the emergence of diffusion techniques [15], diffusion-based SR models [30, 34, 37] are able to learn an even more powerful image representation and effectively handle various distortions in LR images. However, while the perceptual quality of SR outputs keeps improving, recent research finds lingering inconsistency between perceptual quality and quantitative evaluations of SR models [30, 34, 37]. As result, either cumbersome user studies or varying image metrics are sought to justify SR model performances. In this paper, we investigate the issue and propose solution that better correlates with human perception. 2.2. Image quality metrics Image quality metrics are widely used as evaluation criteria for image processing systems. In most cases, the evaluations assume GTs are accessible for varying tasks, and thus, full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) approaches are applied. These approaches measure the similarity between the target and GT image to evaluate the performance. Common metrics include distortion-based metrics such as PSNR, SSIM [32] and FSIM [41], and recent perceptual-based metrics such as LPIPS [44] and DISTS [12]. However, since FRIQA assumes references are perfect, only absolute similarity/dissimilarity is measured, thus failing in handling cases where reference images are perceptually poor. Noticing the inconsistency between human perception 2 and some FR-IQA metrics, recent SR studies also adopt noreference IQA (NR-IQA) metrics for evaluations. Widely applied metrics including Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) based metrics such as NIQE [24], IL-NIQE [42] and PI [5], and deep-learning based metrics such as MUSIQ [17], MANIQA [36] and Clip-IQA [29]. Since these metrics evaluate image quality without any reference, it is still doubtful if they make reliable predictions. As result, current SR studies [30, 34, 37] widely conduct user studies to obtain convincing evaluations. Note that some IQA datasets (e.g. BAPPS [43] and PieAPP [26]) employ 2AFC (Two Alternative Forced Choice) strategy to collect user preferences over pair of images, which resembles the proposed relative quality scheme. However, the logic is still different. In 2AFC, given pair of images, users are asked to compare which one is closer to the reference, in contrast, in RQI, we only compare which image is relatively better than the other one without any reference, since we assume references can also show poor quality. Based on this assumption, we develop different training strategy from traditional FRor NRmetrics, showing its superiority over current schemes. 3. How GTs Affect SR Model Evaluations We focus on the classic 4 SR task and evaluate seven including two GANrepresentative SOTA SR models, based models RealESRGAN [31], BSRGAN [40], two transformer-based models SwinIR [19], HAT [9], and three difussion-based models StableSR [30], SeeSR [34] and PASD [37]. We evaluate all the models according to their official implementations on test sets from 3 real-world SR datasets, i.e. DIV2K-wild [2], DRealSR [33] and RealSR [6]. We first employ the NR-IQA metric KonIQ++ [27] to assess the quality and degradation of GTs from three datasets, and show their distributions in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2. a), even for GT images, their quality can be limited as the highest quality score can reach 100. The issue is more apparent for DRealSR and RealSR, where most quality scores fall below 60. For degradation (Figure 2. b)-d)), while the contrast problem is small, blur and noise can exist in some images, potentially bringing biases for evaluations. In Figure 3, we intuitively show GT samples from three datasets, where they suffer from different degradation including blur, noise and vague details. After assessing the quality of GTs in three datasets, we investigate how their quality affects the evaluations of SR models. In Figure 4, we gradually discard images with the lowest GT quality according to the KonIQ++ scores from all three datasets and evaluate the model performance on the remaining images. We discard from 0% to 80% images in total and show average PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and DISTS scores with the amount of discarded images. From Figure 4, we make several observations and discussions: (a) Quality score distribution (b) Blur level distribution (c) Noise level distribution (d) Contrast problem distribution Figure 2. GT Quality and degradation distributions in three SR datasets. All scores range from 0 to 100, (a): higher quality score indicates better quality, (b)-(d): higher degradation scores indicate larger distortions. Figure 3. GT samples from RealSR [6], DRealSR [33] and DIV2K [2] dataset. The images suffer from blur, vague details, and noise problems respectively. Please zoom in for better view. 1. challenging image will always be challenging. We observe that in all the models, similar performance fluctuations occur when the same image is discarded, indicating that challenging images are always challenging regardless of SR models. This observation also provides insight into how to improve future SR models by troubleshooting those images that are challenging across models. 2. High quality GTs are consistently challenging for SR models. As low-quality GTs are discarded from evaluations, we observe consistent performance drop for all the models on all the metrics (decrease in PSNR, SSIM, and increase in LPIPS and DISTS). We also show in Supplementary Material that this phenomenon is not incidental, i.e., the consistent drop would not happen if we randomly discard images. This observation indicates the evaluation of SR models can be inherently affected by the quality of GTs, where high-quality GT can usually lead to lower performances. We attribute this to the loss of details and vague structures in low-quality GTs (see Figure 3), making it easy to achieve high quantitative evaluations on both distortion and perception metrics. The phenomenon further indicates 3 Figure 4. We show how evaluations of 7 SR models change when low-quality GT are gradually discarded from the testing datasets. the limitations of current SR models in generating finer details and producing very high-quality outputs. 3. Different evaluation results can be reached when GT quality is controlled. We can observe this change by perceptual metrics LPIPS and especially DISTS, where model rankings can change dramatically according to the GT quality. clear example is SeeSR [34], which moves from Rank #6 to Rank #2 by LPIPS and from Rank #6 to Rank #1 by DISTS when looking only at images with higher GT quality. This trend agrees with our assumption that model outputs can be better than GTs, resulting in those methods obtaining lower rankings when poorer GTs are included. This also indicates the existence of biased evaluations with unreliable GTs, as solution, in Section 4, we propose RQI to relieve the impact of low-quality GTs. 4. The perception-distortion tradeoff [4] also exists. We can see that HAT [9] and PASD [37], the two topperforming models by distortion metrics PSNR and SSIM, perform relatively low on perception metrics LPIPS and DISTS. In contrast, well-performing models by perceptual metrics (SwinIR [19] and SeeSR [34]) achieve low performances on PSNR and SSIM. However, it is worth thinking, in cases where GT quality is low, is it still convincing to compute pixel-wise distortion metrics as fidelity evaluations? For GTs with distortions, the fidelity metrics will reward methods that fail to remove distortions. We believe controlling high-quality GT in future SR datasets and developing adaptive fidelity metrics can relieve the issue. The analysis above demonstrates that low-quality GTs can introduce biased SR model evaluations. Therefore, with the current evaluation paradigm, it is crucial to guarantee GT quality during evaluations to ensure fairness. However, even if it is possible to evaluate models only on high-quality GTs in existing datasets by filtering out the unqualified ones, the test samples will be reduced, thus affecting the reliability of evaluations. To alleviate these problems, in the following section, we further investigate how to make fair evaluations with imperfect GTs. 4. How to Fairly Evaluate with Imperfect GTs Our solution is straightforward and simple: Since we do not recognize GTs as perfect references, we allow cases in which model outputs (i.e. target images) can achieve better quality than the GT. Therefore, instead of measuring absolute differences between target and reference (GT) images as adopted in previous FR metrics [12, 32, 44], we serve GTs as anchors and measure the relative quality from target images to GTs (i.e. either better or worse). We name the proposed scheme RQI (Relative Quality Index), and define it with the following property: RQI(IHR, IGT ) (cid:40) > 0, IHR has better quality. < 0, IGT has better quality. (2) This design is different from the current FR-IQA scheme in three aspects, shown in Figure 5: 1. RQI is an order-sensitive metric. Thus, RQI(IA, IB) and RQI(IB, IA) can lead to opposite results. In contrast, in existing FR metrics [12, 32, 44], D(IA, IB) and D(IB, IA) have the same results, as they suppose that one of the inputs always shows the best quality. 2. Any two images are considered as pairs during training. For current FR-IQA scheme, given one reference image I0 and sequence of its distorted images {I1, I2, ..., In}, only image pairs {I0, Ii}, [1, n] are constructed to train the model. In RQI, as we consider that GTs also contain distortions, we select arbitrary two images from the sequence {I0, I1, ..., In} to construct training pairs {Ii, Ij}, i, [0, n], = j. This not only yields to larger amount of training samples (n2 vs. n), but also covers more complex cases in which both GTs and target images may contain varying degradations. 3. RQI calculates discrepancies. For training labels, we calculate quality discrepancy between Ii and Ij, i.e. qiqj, whereas FR-IQA metrics adopt qi as quality label for image pair {I0, Ii}. Training an IQA model under the RQI scheme is simple: we select random image pairs (containing the same content) from any existing IQA dataset and calculate their quality differences to use them as discrepancy labels (either positive or negative). Then, the ordered image pairs are fed to the model to predict the discrepancy value. Thus, we can train an arbitrary FR-IQA model on any IQA dataset under the proposed scheme. In practice, we train three different IQA models AHIQ [18], MANIQA [36], and TOPIQ [7], on (a) Traditional FR-IQA scheme (b) The proposed RQI scheme Figure 5. The proposed RQI scheme differs from traditional FRIQA scheme in three aspects: 1. RQI is order-sensitive. 2. We substitute reference image I0 to any image Ii in the distorted image sequence. 3. Relative quality discrepancy is used as label. three different datasets Kadid-10K [21], PieAPP [26] and PIPAL [16]. Since MANIQA [36] is an NR-IQA model, we modify it to extract features both from the target image and the reference image, and then concatenate the features before the transposed attention block to fuse them. For all datasets, we construct labels for arbitrary image pairs and normalize them to [1, 1]. We also remove the activation functions in the last regression layer to ensure all of the models produce negative values. We didnt train the models on the perceptual IQA dataset BAPPS [43] since the 64 64 image patch resolution is too small for the selected IQA models. We train all models following their official configurations, and we select the best-performing models by looking at their performances on the validation split. During testing, we fed the target image and GT to the model in order. We also downscale the input 2 times and select random crops from different scales to ensure multiscale features are captured from high-resolution inputs. The mean score of the crops is reported as the RQI value. 5. Evaluations In this section, we conduct two main types of evaluations: subjective user study and quantitative comparisons regarding the consistency of image metrics. 5.1. User study and discussion To analyze how existing image metrics correlate with human opinions, we first conduct comprehensive user study to collect subjective scores on different SR models and their corresponding GTs. Specifically, we collect user opinions from seven selected SR models, tested on five SR test datasets DIV2K-wild [2], DRealSR [33], RealSR [6], Set5 [3] and Set14 [39]. Our experiment consists of two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm. The observers were asked to select the HR image that showed better perceptual quality from pair of images containing the same content. For each source scene, the users compared eight images (7 model outputs + GT). For each comparison, we collect opinions Figure 6. User statistics of the best quality HR image in four SR datasets. from at least 15 users, all of whom have passed the Ishihara test to avoid color blindness. Then, we use Thurstones model [28] to reconstruct ranking from the users opinion. We carefully control the experiment in matte dark room where the monitor is the only light source. Images are shown in 3K resolution monitor set to sRGB. We randomize the order and placement (left or right) of image pairs to reduce potential biases. For the DRealSR dataset, since the HR images are more than 4K resolutions, we only compare the center-cropped images to avoid scaling effects. In total, we collect user scores on 8 312 = 2, 496 images, far exceeding image opinions collected in previous SR studies [30, 34, 37]. In Figure 6, we show statistics of the best-ranked images by the users from all test sets. Since Set4 and Set15 are similar and only contain few images, we combine these two datasets for evaluation in the rest of the paper. From the statistics, we can extract several findings. 1. There exist model outputs better than GTs. For all the datasets, there exist model outputs that are perceptually better than GTs, and the percentage increases when the dataset contains poorer GTs (a small percentage from DIV2K and more than half from Set5&Set14). 2. Diffusion-based models are preferred. Most of the preferred model outputs are from diffusion-based models, indicating that the diffusion-based scheme has better capability to recover distortions and reconstruct finer details. 3. SeeSR [34] is the preferred method by users. Among all the competing models SeeSR produces most of the preferred images, which is also consistent with our observation in Figure 3, where perceptual metrics tend to favor SeeSR when low-quality GTs are discarded for evaluations. In Figure 7, we show the Thurstone scores for all the datasets. We can extract similar observations. More discussions about SR models behavior can be found in the supplementary material. 5.2. The effectiveness of the RQI scheme We calculate the Spearman Rank order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) between IQA model predictions and user opinions to show how model evaluations correlate with human perception. Specifically, for each source image, we obtain model predictions and Thurstone scores on the 7 SR Figure 7. Average user scores on different SR models (including GT) in four SR testing datasets.

For all images in dataset, the averaged SRCC value is reported. As stated in Section 4, we train three IQA models (AHIQ [18], MANIQA [36] and TOPIQ [7]) on three IQA datasets (Kadid-10K [21], PieAPP [26] and PIPAL [16]), both in traditional FR-IQA setting and in our proposed RQI setting (with subscript R). In total 18 models are tested on user scores collected for four SR datasets. Table 1 shows the results and we make several observations. First, we observe consistent SRCC improvement on all four testing sets by training under the RQI scheme, regardless of which IQA model or training set is applied. This indicates the effectiveness of the scheme. Second, by calculating the average improvement for each testing dataset, the improvements on DIV2K, RealSR, DRealSR, and Set5&Set14 are 0.077, 0.085, 0.146, and 0.138, respectively. The improvements on DRealSR and Set5&Set14 are relatively larger, consistent with our observation in Figure 6, resulting that when more outputs are preferred than GTs, the RQI becomes more effective. Third, among three selected IQA models, we observe MANIQA [36] achieves better consistency, while among all training sets, models trained on PIPAL [16] perform better. Therefore, we select the best-performing model RQIM AN IQA trained on the PIPAL dataset for analysis in the rest of the paper. 5.3. Analysis of existing metrics We further analyze how current evaluation metrics correlate with human perception. The selected metrics include widely used distortion metrics SSIM [32] and PSNR, recent deep-learning based perception metrics DISTS [12] and LPIPS [44], traditional NR-IQA metrics NIQE [24] and PI [5], recent deep-learning based NR-IQA metrics ClipIQA [29] and MANIQA [36], and the proposed RQI. We calculate, for each source image, SRCC and Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) between metric evaluations and user opinions. We report the averaged values for each dataset. In addition, since in SR comparisons, the bestperforming model is more valued, we also compute the prediction accuracy for the best-performing model within each dataset (Winning Rate). The results are shown in Table 2. Based on this table, we can make detailed analysis of current image evaluation metrics. 1. Traditional distortion image metrics do not correlate with human perception. SSIM [32] and PSNR, though surprising, are making opposite evaluations with human perception on all the datasets. As we collect user opinions purely on their perceptual impressions of the images, the results further demonstrate the perception-distortion trade-off [4]. However, we believe the inconsistency partly stems from the issue of unreliable GTs, therefore, we urge for high-quality GTs in future SR datasets. 2. Deep-learning-based perceptual metrics perform similarly. Both DISTS [12] and LPIPS [44] show some consistency on the DIV2K and Set5&Set14 datasets but fail on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets. This is probably due to the poor image quality in the RealSR dataset and the larger image resolution size in the DRealSR dataset. 3. Traditional NR-IQA metrics do have good consistency. Two traditional NR-IQA metrics, NIQE [24] and PI [5], show good consistency with human perception. This indicates the power of traditional NSS features for image quality measurement. 4. Deep-learning based NR-IQA also present some degree of consistency. The two deep-learning based NR6 Table 2. Consistency evaluations of current metrics with human perception.

IQA models, Clip-IQA [29] and MANIQA [36], also achieve user consistency to some extend. From 3. and 4. we should notice that all the four NR-IQA metrics (NIQE [24], PI [5], Clip-IQA [29] and MANIQA [36]) are out performing the FR-IQA metrics on RealSR, DRealSR and Set5&Set14 datasets. Since GT quality in these datasets can be poor, the result further demonstrates the inconsistency can be attributed to the poor quality of the reference GT images. 5. RQI outperforms the other metrics. RQI achieves the best consistency with human perception in most cases, and we attribute its superior performance to the training scheme that covers complicate cases where both target and reference image contain distortions. For more qualitative analysis of existing metrics, please refer to Section 5.5. 5.4. Evaluation on other SR-IQA benchmarks We further evaluate all the metrics on other two SR-IQA benchmarks BSD-SR [23], QADS [49], and one general IQA dataset Kadid-10K [21]. The BSD-SR dataset contains 30 source images and 1,620 HR images generated from 6 scales, the QADS dataset contains 20 source images and 980 HR images with interpolation factors 2, 4, and 8, and the Kadid-10K dataset contains 81 source images and 10,125 distorted images. Images in BSD-SR and QADS are produced by varying SR methods, while the Kadid10K dataset contains images generated from different distortions. All datasets collect Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from users as perception scores. We test the metrics on the whole data of three datasets and report SRCC and PLCC values. Both mean consistency over each source image and overall consistency are reported. Note that we do not evaluate DISTS [12] on the Kadid-10K dataset since the model is pre-trained on this same dataset. We show the results in Table 3 and make the following observations. For the two SR-IQA datasets (BSD-SR and QADS), traditional metrics such as SSIM [32] achieve good consistency when evaluating outputs from the same source images. We attribute this to the simple SR models (interpolation, dictionary-based, and early CNN models) collected in the two datasets. Therefore, it is relatively easier to distinguish image quality in early SR models. Yet their performances are limited in evaluating all images across contents. Second, the FR-IQA metrics generally perform better than NR-IQA metrics, which seems to be contradictory with the results in Table 2. However, HR images in these two datasets are produced by earlier SR models, mostly showing poorer quality than GTs. As GTs in these datasets are serving as better references, FR-IQA metrics are able to make better predictions than metrics that do not consider reference images. Third, among all the metrics, RQI can perform stably across all datasets and criteria. Note that we train RQI only by relative quality discrepancy, but it still achieves good consistency across image contents, on different SR scales, and even on the general IQA task. All the results validate the generalized ability of the RQI metric. 5.5. Qualitative analysis Figure 8 shows how existing distortion FR-IQA metrics, perception FR-IQA metrics, and NR-IQA metrics can fail. Among them, the distortion FR-IQA metric SSIM [32] (the up-left case) tends to favor blur regions (RealESRGAN) more than textures (SeeSR), which also matches previous findings [44]. For NR-IQA metrics, though they perform well in evaluating overall image quality, they fail when image semantics change from GTs due to their lack of reference. As shown up-right, the multi-model based NR-IQA metric ClipIQA [29] fails to evaluate character consistency for BSRGAN and PASD, since it cannot refer to correct semantics. Finally, perceptual FR-IQA metrics can easily fail when GT quality is poor (two cases at the bottom). In these cases, we show that when GT contains either vague details or distortions, the two perceptual FR-IQA metrics LPIPS [44] and DISTS [12] favor blurred results (HAT) more than sharp ones (SeeSR) since they are perceptually closer to the In contrast, the proposed RQI is percepreference GTs. tually accurate, aware of semantic consistency, and avoids biased evaluations caused by unreliable GTs. 7 Table 3.

Please zoom in for better view. 6. Discussion deraining [38], etc. and we leave this as future work. We point out the existence of poor-quality GTs in existing SR datasets and raise discussions about how future SR research can be developed. First, we urge careful consideration in building future SR datasets, where GT quality should be meticulously controlled. Second, we observe certain images can be consistently challenging for existing SR models, suggesting further development of the models upon the challenging cases. Third, with imperfect GTs in current SR datasets, we propose RQI to fairly evaluate models, and we expect the same consideration can be taken when future metrics are developed. Last, it will also be interesting to explore if the same issue exists in other low-level image processing tasks such as deblurring [25], denoising [1], and 7. Conclusion In this paper, we study the emerging inconsistency between perceptual and quantitative evaluations that bothers current SR models. We point out the poor quality of GTs is also responsible for this inconsistency. After demonstrating how GT quality affects SR model evaluations, we propose simple yet effective scheme, RQI, to relieve the evaluation biases caused by imperfect GTs. We show that the proposed RQI can achieve better consistency with human perception data, both on new user study and on existing benchmarks. We believe our research will shed light on both future SR research and evaluations."

            "content": "A. More analysis of how GT quality affects SR evaluations In the main paper, we employed the KonIQ++ [27] model to assess GT quality and showed there exists an inherent connection between GT quality and model evaluations. In this part, we show that similar observation can also be made from other IQA model predictions, and that this connection is not occasional. We employ another NR-IQA model MANIQA [36] to assess GT quality, and discard images based on its prediction. The evaluation results are shown in Figure 9, where we can see consistent drop in model performances. In Figure 10, we show that by randomly discarding images, this consistent performance drop will not occur. Figures are shown in unified scale. B. Implementation details The selected models are trained following their official implementations, i.e. for all the models, the learning rate is set to 104 with weight decay 105. The batch size is set to 4 for AHIQ [18], and 8 for MANIQA [36] and TOPIQ [7]. AHIQ [18] and MANIQA [36] randomly crop image patches with size 224, while TOPIQ [7] randomly crop image patches with size 384. The crops are randomly flipped during training for augmentation. We split the training datasets with 20% images according to contents as the validation set, and select the best-performing models upon their performances on the validation set. During testing, we randomly crop patches from the inputs. The patches are cropped from the same regions of the target image and GT. Since we crop patches from 3 different scales, in each scale, 20 patches are cropped and the final score is averaged across all patches. The downscaling and cropping will only operate on images that are larger than the required input size of the models (i.e. 224 for AHIQ [18] and MANIQA [36], and 384 for TOPIQ [7]). C. More discussions about SR models In this section, we discuss the behaviors of SR models (mainly diffusion-based models) in more detail. We show qualitative examples in which model outputs are perceptually better than GTs, and then briefly analyze the three diffusion-based models StableSR [30], SeeSR [34] and PASD [37]. C.1. More examples of perceptually poorer GTs and better model outputs In Figures 11 - 14, we show cases in which model outputs are better than GTs from datasets DIV2K [2], RealSR [6], DRealSR [33], Set5 [3] and Set14 [39] respectively. As shown, GTs across datasets exhibit noise, blur, compression artifacts, and vague details. For DIV2K [2], the overall GT quality is better, thus less suffers from the problems. However, for Set5&Set14, where the images were collected in early ages, current models can easily produce better outputs than GT quality. This further indicates that, with the advancing of methods, it is also necessary to update corresponding datasets and evaluation metrics to match the renewing technology. C.2. More discussions about diffusion-based SR models and how they affect human perception Though generally, diffusion-based models can produce perceptually better images, from user preferences, we also find that the three evaluated diffusion-based models can perform differently from each other. In this part, we briefly discuss how the models perform and how the results affect the perceptual evaluations. StableSR [30] leans to increase image contrast by sharpening the edges. In cases where edges are thin, the overall image contrast is increased, leading to better perceptual quality. However, when images contain strong edges, StableSR tends to over-process the edges which brings artifacts, leading to poorer perceptual evaluations (see Figure 15). SeeSR [34] produces perceptually better images in most cases, due to its strong generation power. However, we find it sometimes changes image semantics, affecting user choices during experiments (see Figure 16). PASD [37] is also capable of recovering high-quality details, however, the model leans to produce out-of-focus effects (see Figure 17). During experiments, we find this effect can happen on the wrong subjects in the image, therefore leading to poorer perceptual quality. Note that even with different behaviors of the diffusion9 Figure 9. Model evaluation results when discard low quality GTs according to MANIQA [36] predictions. Similar observations can also be made to those of the main paper. Figure 10. Model evaluation results when randomly discard images. The connection between GT quality and model evaluations does not exist in this scenario. based models, the proposed RQI can still achieve good consistency with humans on varying cases. D. Ablation study In this section, we show more ablation results of the proposed RQI scheme. Since we propose training RQI with image pairs that contain arbitrary distortions, the images contain distortions across types and levels. Therefore, we compare training RQI with image pairs containing the same type of distortions, denoted as RQIsingle distortion. We also compare testing RQI on single-scale images, instead of cropping multi-scale patches, denoted as RQIsingle-scale. The models are compared with our full model on user opinions collected from four datasets DIV2K [2], RealSR [6], DRealSR [33], and Set5&Set14 [3, 39]. RQIsingle-scale is not tested on Set5&Set14, since the image resolutions are low and cannot be down-scaled. The results are shown in Table 4. From Table 4, several observations can be made. First, there is significant performance drop when training RQI merely on same-distortion image pairs. We attribute this to the different types of distortions that GT and model outputs may contain. GTs usually contain common distortions (noise, blur, compression artifacts .etc), while model outputs are introducing algorithms-caused distortions, featuring different representations from each other. However, by training RQI on arbitrary distortions, the model is capable of measuring quality that covers complex distortions, showing superior performance on all four datasets. Second, we also observe slight performance improvement on RealSR [6], but relatively larger performance gain on DIV2K [2] and DRealSR [33] when testing on multi-scale patches. Since image resolutions in DIV2K [2] and DRealSR [33] are relatively larger, evaluating RQI in multi-scale not only captures detailed texture quality but also measures structure and semantic consistency, leading to better alignment with human perception. E. More qualitative comparisons In this section, we provide more qualitative comparisons to show how different types of metrics can fail and the RQI results. For easier comparison, all scores are normalized to [0, 1], and higher score indicates better visual quality. Figure 18 shows two distortion-based FR-IQA metrics SSIM [32] and PSNR, where they favor blurry regions more than detailed textures, leading to contradictory predictions with human perception. Figure 19 shows four NR-IQA metrics PI [5], NIQE [24], Clip-IQA [29] and MANIQA [36], all of which can fail on subtle structure or semantic changes due to the lack of references. Figure 20 shows two perceptionbased FR-IQA metrics LPIPS [44] and DISTS [12]. As can be seen, the two metrics suffer from poor GT quality, thus can not make correct evaluations when model outputs show better quality. As comparison, RQI makes correct evaluations on all the above cases, showing its superiority as reliable image metric for SR evaluations. 10 (a) GT (b) SeeSR (c) GT (d) SeeSR Figure 11.
