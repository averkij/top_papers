As multimodal contexts (images\nand text) become more common in real-world scenarios, recent\nstudies [16, 39, 45] suggest incorporating images to enhance entity\ndisambiguation, leading to the emergence of Multimodal Entity\nLinking (MEL)[11].",
            "content": "In the early stages, numerous deep learning (DL)-based[15] methods have been developed for the MEL task. These methods generally extract unimodal features for the text and image separately, followed by feature fusion [20, 34, 35], or directly extract multimodal features from the text and image through cross-attention mechanisms [8, 47]. These extracted features are then compared with entity features to identify the target that best matches the given mention. However, such methods face two challenges: 1) The models lack sufficient prior knowledge, making it difficult to handle MM 25, October 2731, 2025, Dublin, Ireland Ziyan Liu et al. Reflections (denoted as I2CR) for the MEL task. It primarily relies on text information to solve problems, then verifies the results using intraand inter-modal strategies, and finally introduces visual clues through multi-round iterative process when text alone is insufficient. Specifically, we first utilize the lexical relevance matching method and LLM fine-tuned on MEL data to select candidate entity from the KG for the given mention. To ensure the selection is faithful to the mention context, we then design intra-modal consistency reflection, which evaluates the semantic granularity between the mention and the selected entity. If the alignment is weak, this step triggers entity re-selection. Finally, we propose an innovative utilization of images through modality alignment reflection strategy. This includes inter-modal alignment check and visual iterative feedback to decide whether visual information is necessary for refining the selection. When image input is required, we perform multiple rounds of iteration using various image-to-text models, leveraging visual clues from different perspectives while avoiding information overload. Unlike methods that directly fuse text and image modalities, our strategy simplifies the task and reduces noise introduced to the LLM. Contributions. The contributions of this study are summarized as follows: We propose novel I2CR framework that primarily relies on text information and integrates visual clues through multiround iterative process only when text alone is insufficient, reducing images noise introduced to the LLM. We propose novel approach for image utilization that leverages the visual modality to verify text-based results and transforms image information into diverse textual visual cues, improving the entity matching performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on three widely used datasets, with top-1 accuracy of 92.2% (+3.2%) on WikiMEL, 91.6% (+5.1%) on WikiDiverse, and 86.8% (+1.6%) on RichMEL."

            "title": "2 Related Work\nRelated work in this study can be divided into three categories:\nentity linking, multimodal entity linking, and LLM-based reflection.\nEntity linking. Most previous methods for entity linking using\nonly text follow two stages: retrieval[6] followed by re-ranking[3,\n33]. In the retrieval stage, the system searches a large-scale KG to\nfind entities related to the mention. In the re-ranking stage, it scores\nand ranks these candidates to choose the best one. For instance,\nBLINK [41] uses a bi-encoder[46] to represent the context of the\nmention and the descriptions of entities to retrieve candidates. It\nthen uses a cross-encoder to rank them. Similarly, Xu et al. [43]\nuse dual encoders for retrieval and a LUKE-based cross-encoder\nfor ranking. EPGEL [14] builds an entity profile and uses a seq2seq\nmodel[10, 36] to rank candidates. However, when the text is brief or\nvague, it’s difficult to link entities accurately using only text[1]. In\nthese cases, adding image information can help improve the results.\nMultimodal entity linking. Existing approaches for MEL gen-\nerally fall into two categories: traditional DL- and LLM-based meth-\nods. In the first group, traditional DL-based methods usually encode\nthe text and image of a mention separately, then combine these\nfeatures to align them with candidate entities. For instance, MIMIC",
            "content": "Figure 1: Two limitations of current LLM-based methods for the MEL task: (a) unnecessary incorporation of image data, and (b) reliance on one-time extraction of visual features. samples requiring deeper reasoning. For instance, given the mention Presidential State Car, DL-based methods might identify the car in the mention image as Cadillac limousine. However, without knowing that this type of car is used by the U.S. president, it may not link it to the correct entity Presidential state car (United States). 2) These models also dont generalize well because theyre trained on one specific task with limited data. They often learn patterns that only work for the training examples. So, if the input changes even slightly, the model might get confused. Instead of learning how to deal with new situations, it mostly just memorizes the training data. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based methods have become the mainstream paradigm for solving MEL tasks. These methods typically feed both text and images (or its visual features extracted by an image encoder) into the multimodal LLM (MLLM), enabling the model to select the most relevant entity from the KG for given mention[17, 31]. Since LLMs are trained on vast corpora, they possess extensive knowledge and robust generalization capabilities, which allow them to overcome the issues of insufficient prior knowledge and limited generalization faced by traditional DL-based MEL methods. However, two main challenges remain: 1) In the MEL task, not all scenarios require additional image information. For instance, in Figure 1(a), the model can correctly infer that the mention MySpace refers to website based on the textual context alone. However, when the image is introduced (showing person holding gun), it may mislead the model into selecting person or viral video instead of the correct entity. 2) Existing methods typically rely on single-pass approach to extract visual features from an image or generate its text description. However, this one-time processing often fails to capture the full range of relevant information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the given mention image. As shown in Figure 1(b), if the model relies solely on the description generated by the LLM, it may incorrectly identify the mention Thorne as an actress. However, if the OCR result from the image, which shows the word MUSIC, is also considered, the model can more accurately infer that Thorne is not only an actress but also singer. To address the above problems, we propose an innovative framework known as LLM-based Intraand Inter-modal Collaborative I2CR: Intraand Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections for Multimodal Entity Linking MM 25, October 2731, 2025, Dublin, Ireland [20] extracts both global and local features from text and images using separate encoders, then uses three interaction units to calculate matching score for each mention-entity pair. Similarly, DWE [35] and DWE+ [34] enhance visual features by adding fine-grained image details (e.g., scene feature) and applying cross-modal enhancers to better align text and image modalities. Other approaches directly extract multimodal features from text and images, such as DZMNED employing modality attention [24], GHMFC using gated fusion and contrastive training [38], and OT-MEL modeling fusion as an optimal transport problem [47]. In the second group, GEMEL [31] introduces generative MEL method that directly generates the target entity name for given mention by training feature mapper to enable cross-modal interactions. UniMEL [17] leverages LLMs to enhance the representation of mentions and entities by incorporating both textual and visual information. It then uses LLMs to select the target entity from the candidates with only minimal fine-tuned. In this study, we adopt the second paradigm. However, as mentioned earlier, current LLM-based methods unnecessarily incorporate image data in some cases and rely only on one-time extraction of visual features, which may limit their effectiveness. LLM-based reflection. LLMs have been widely adopted for various tasks due to their impressive capabilities. However, they still face challenges like hallucinationsproducing inaccurate or fabricated contentand unfaithful reasoning. promising solution is to incorporate reflection steps [25], allowing models to self-refine their own outputs. Reflection feedback can be divided into two main types: 1) Self-provided feedback from the LLM itself [32], and 2) Externally provided feedback [26]. The first type uses the LLM for both evaluation and refinement. Techniques like SELFCHECK [23] and SELF-REFINE [21] follow an iterative process where the LLM continuously evaluates and refines its output until certain predefined criteria are met. The second type uses external toolssuch as separately trained models [2], additional domainspecific knowledge [26], or other resources [40]to assess and enhance the LLMs responses. External feedback adds flexibility by providing information beyond the LLMs own knowledge, helping to identify errors or inconsistencies the model might miss. It is especially useful when the LLMs self-evaluation is insufficient. In our framework, both intra-modal consistency reflection and inter-modal alignment verification belong to the second category. separately trained model assesses whether the LLM needs to reselect candidate entities. The latter also extracts visual clues using image-to-text models and fed back into the LLM."

Then, we employ an advanced embedding model to encode both 𝐶𝑚 and 𝐶𝑒 into semantic vector representations. The degree of semantic alignment is measured by computing the similarity between the two embeddings, implemented as normalized dot product: (2) 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑐𝑟 = 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑 (𝐶𝑚) 𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑 (𝐶𝑒 )) , where 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚() represents the normalization operation. If 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒_𝑖𝑐𝑟 > 𝛼, where 𝛼 is predefined threshold, the candidate entity 𝑒 is considered semantically consistent with the mention 𝑚. Otherwise, the process returns to the step 1, removes 𝑒 from the candidate set, and proceeds to reselect more appropriate entity. This process continues until the selected entity is semantically consistent with the given mention or the predefined iteration limit is reached. If the limit is reached without finding reasonable entity, the last selected entity is used as the target."

We compare our proposed framework with various SoTA methods, which are divided into two groups: Text-only methods: BERT [13] is used to encode the mention and entity to extract features for relevance scoring. RoBERTa [18] is BERT variant. BLINK [41] is two-stage method: retrieval and re-ranking. Visual-text fusion methods: CLIP [27] uses Transformerbased encoders for visual-text feature extraction. DZMNED [24] combines visual, textual, and character features with modality attention. JMEL [1] maps visual and textual features to joint space. GHMFC [38] employs gated fusion and contrastive training for entity linking. MIMIC [20] fuses features via interaction units with contrastive learning. DRIN [42] uses dynamic GCN for mention-entity alignment. GEMEL [31] leverages LLMs for generative linking with in-context learning. DWE [35] integrates text and visual features, refining with Wikipedia. DWE+[34] is vriant of DWE. OT-MEL [47] formulates the correlation assignment as an optimal transport problem. Unimel [17] use LLMs to select the targe entity. Metrics. Following previous works [34, 47], we employ the Top𝐾 accuracy metric for evaluation: 𝑇𝑜𝑝-𝐾 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝐼 (𝑔𝑖 𝑃𝐾 𝑖 ), (4) 𝑖=1 where 𝑁 denotes the total number of samples, 𝑔𝑖 is the ground truth entity, 𝑃𝐾 represents the set of the top-𝐾 predicted entities, and 𝑖 𝐼 () is the indicator function. The process of selecting the Top-K (𝐾=3 or 5) results in our I2CR framework is as follows: In the first step (TES), we iteratively perform the process until the number of entities in the candidate set reaches 𝐾. In the second (ICR) and third (IAV) steps, we rank the entities that do not meet the judgment criteria at the end of the set. If none of the entities in the set meet the criteria, we iteratively reselect Top-𝐾 candidate entities. Implementation details. During training, we fine-tune Llama38B [9] using LoRA [12] with the AdamW optimizer, learning rate of 2e-5, batch size 1, gradient accumulation steps of 16, and 100 warm-up steps. To test the robustness and generalization of our framework, we train it only on WikiDiverse and test it on three datasets. Since the entity descriptions in WikiDiverse are longer and more complex, using them directly as input may exceed the LLMs input limits and cause the model to truncate the text. This would affect the models ability to extract and understand the information accurately. To solve this, we follow prior work [17] and use Llama3-8B with prompt to summarize the descriptions, shortening them to length similar to those in WikiMEL and RichMEL. For inference, the temperature is set to 0.9, with other parameters at defaults. In Section 4.1, we set 𝑘=10. In Section 4.2, we consider SFR-Embedding-Mistral [22] as our embedding model. We set 𝛼=0.5 for WikiMEL, 0.8 for WikiDiverse, and 0.75 for RichMEL. In Section 4.3, we use CLIP2 as the multimodal pre-trained model and set 𝛽=31 for all three datasets. 𝛼 and 𝛽 are determined through the validation set. In Section 4.4, we employ four latest models (i.e., OCR, Image Captioning, Dense Captioning, and Image Tagging) from Azure Cognitive Services APIs3 as the image-to-text models. Our experiments are conducted on workstation running Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, with two NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs, and 80GB of memory."

Specifically, our framework achieves top-1 accuracies of 92.2%, 91.6%, and 86.8% on the three datasets, respectively, which are 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6% higher than the previous best methods. Notably, our framework is trained only on WikiDiverse, not on WikiMEL or RichMEL, yet it still achieves SoTA performance on these two datasets. This demonstrates the robustness and strong generalization ability of our framework. In addition, the performance on RichMEL is relatively lower compared to WikiMEL and WikiDiverse. From our analysis of the error cases, we find that RichMEL contains samples that require more strong prior knowledge and complex reasoning. For instance, mention refers to an athlete, but the textual context describes this individuals movie experience, and the accompanying image is an ID photo. This type of samples requires the model to possess prior knowledge that the athlete has also been involved in movies, which poses greater challenge."

To evaluate the effectiveness of different faceted visual clues in VIF, we systematically test all possible combinations of the four image-to-text models. The results are shown in Table 4. From the results, we conclude that: 1) All four sub-modules in VIF contribute positively to the overall performance of the framework, demonstrating that each faceted visual clue is valuable. 2) The contribution of each sub-module varies depending on the dataset. For instance, on WikiMEL and WikiDiverse, the image captioning sub-module provides the most significant improvement, while on RichMEL, OCR proves to be more important. In this study, we integrate all four sub-modules into the framework."

For open-source models, there are two options: fine-tuning the LLM on the training set directly, or fine-tuning it using our framework. For closed-source models, the options are: using the LLM directly for inference, or using the LLM for inference with our I2CR framework. Since using closed-source models incurs API costs, we randomly select 100 samples from each of the three datasets for experiments. The results are shown in Table 5. Based on the results, we conclude that our framework improves performance for both open-source and closed-source LLMs, even for the larger 13B LLMs. Impact of visual clues on model performance. To assess the effectiveness of visual clues throughout the iteration process, we report the top-1 accuracy of the model at the different iteration round (round 1, round 2, ..., round 5). Additionally, we compare the effect of using single iteration, where all visual clues are integrated and fed back into the first step. The experimental results 4https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5 Figure 5: Results of using visual clues in different orders. are presented in Figure 4. From these results, we observe: 1) As the number of iteration rounds increases, the models top-1 accuracy on the three datasets gradually improves, indicating that the different visual clues are beneficial to the model. 2) Feeding all visual clues at once shows slight improvement over the 1st round, but performs much worse than using single visual clue per iteration. This suggests that the integration of multiple clues may lead to information overload, making it harder for the model to accurately capture the key information. Impact of visual clue usage order on model performance. In the VIF module, we select one of four image-to-text models per iteration to extract visual clues from the given mention image, without repetition across iterations. In this experiment, we analyze the impact of the order in which visual clues are utilized on model performance. The experimental results are shown in Figure 5. We observe that the order of clue usage has minimal impact on model performance across the three datasets. The maximum performance difference between different orders is no more than 0.3%. Based on this observation, we empirically choose the ocr-cap-den-tag order for our experiments in the study. Average response time of different LLM-based methods.

The comparison results with other LLM-based MEL methods (including UniMEL and GEMEL) are presented in Table 6. From the results, we observe the following: (1) Our proposed I2CR framework not only achieves 3.4% higher average accuracy compared to UniMEL, but also responds 3.27 seconds faster on average. This is because, for each sample, UniMEL requires at least two calls to the LLM and one to the MLLM. (2) Although our I2CR is slower than GEMEL in the Avg-Time metric, it achieves notable 5.7% higher average accuracy, significantly outperforming the GEMEL method. Case study. To more intuitively understand the importance of visual clues in each iteration, we provide case where the result in the 𝑖-th (𝑖 = 1, ..., 5) round is correct, while all prior rounds (1 to 𝑖1) are incorrect. When 𝑖 = 1, the output of the (𝑖1)-th round refers to the result from the first step (the TES module) in the first iteration. The cases are shown in Figure 6.

            "title": "6 Conclusion and Limitations\nIn this study, we propose a novel LLM-based intra- and inter-modal\ncollaborative reflection framework for the MEL task. The frame-\nwork initially uses a fine-tuned LLM to select a candidate entity for\nthe given mention based on mention text. If the entity selected from\nthe text alone is determined to be incorrect through intra-modal\nconsistency reflection and inter-modal alignment verification, we\nintroduce a visual iterative feedback module. This module lever-\nages visual clues generated by multiple image-to-text models for\nthe mention image, assisting LLMs in refining its selection across\nseveral iterations to improve matching accuracy. Experimental re-\nsults on WikiMEL, WikiDiverse, and RichMEL demonstrate that our\nproposed framework achieves SoTA performance, with additional\ndetailed analyses validating the effectiveness of each component.\nAlthough the proposed I2CR framework significantly improves\nmodel performance for the MEL task, it has two main limitations:\n1) I2CR excels in handling common or general questions, but its\neffectiveness may be limited for long-tail questions (e.g., particularly\nrare mentions or entities). 2) I2CR is specifically designed for the\ntextual and visual modalities in MEL, without considering other\nforms of data, such as speech or video, which may also contribute\nvaluable information. We believe that with further optimization,\nour framework will evolve into a more comprehensive solution in\nthe future.",
