            "content": "The acoustic properties of enclosed spaces fundamentally shape human experience within them. concert halls reverberation determines whether orchestral music sounds rich or muddy. classrooms acoustic characteristics directly influence whether students can understand their teacher. Hospital wards with poor acoustic design contribute to patient stress and staff fatigue. Despite this importance, the tools available for analyzing room acoustics have traditionally been either expensive commercial software packages or command-line scripts requiring significant technical expertise. Room impulse responses (RIRs) encode the complete acoustic behavior of space. When sound source emits an impulsive signal in room, the microphone captures not only the direct sound but also reflections from walls, ceiling, floor, and objects within the space. This captured signal, the RIR, can be analyzed to extract numerous perceptually relevant parameters. These parameters inform decisions ranging from whether acoustic treatment is needed to what type of activities space can support. The present work introduces AcoustiVision Pro, web-based platform that makes professional-grade room acoustics analysis accessible to researchers, architects, audio engineers, and educators without requiring specialized software installation or programming knowledge. The system provides twelve analysis modes covering temporal, spectral, and spatial acoustic characteristics. Users can upload their own RIR recordings or draw from the accompanying RIRMega collection of simulated impulse responses. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. An open-source interactive platform implementing standardized acoustic metrics with mathematical rigor and perceptual relevance. 2. Integration with the RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets, providing thousands of room impulse responses with complete metadata for benchmarking and educational purposes. 3. Novel visualization approaches including ani1 mated 3D reflection mapping, waterfall decay plots, and room mode density analysis. 4. Automated compliance checking against ten international and industry standards for various room types. 5. wellness scoring system that synthesizes multiple acoustic parameters into actionable recommendations for space utilization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys existing tools and research in room acoustics analysis. Section 3 presents the mathematical foundations for each acoustic metric Section 4 describes implemented in the system. the RIRMega collection. Section 5 details the system architecture and implementation. Section 6 discusses the user interface design principles. Section 7 presents case studies and preliminary evaluation results.

            "content": "dards The measurement and characterization of room acoustics has been standardized through several international documents. ISO 3382-1 [1] specifies methods for measuring reverberation time and other acoustic parameters in performance spaces. ISO 3382-2 [2] extends these methods to ordinary rooms, while ISO 3382-3 [3] addresses open-plan offices. ANSI S12.60 [4] establishes acoustic performance criteria for classrooms, specifying maximum reverberation times and background noise levels. IEC 6026816 [5] defines the Speech Transmission Index (STI), measure of speech intelligibility that accounts for both reverberation and noise. These standards provide the theoretical basis for the metrics implemented in AcoustiVision Pro. However, the standards documents themselves do not provide software tools, leaving practitioners to implement the calculations themselves or purchase commercial solutions."

ODEON [12] and CATTAcoustic [13] provide comprehensive simulation and measurement capabilities but require substantial financial investment and training. EASERA [14] offers measurement-focused functionality with hardware integration. These tools serve professional acousticians well but remain inaccessible to students, researchers in adjacent fields, and practitioners in resource-limited settings. Open-source alternatives have emerged to address this gap. The Python Acoustics library [15] provides basic acoustic calculations but lacks visualization and user interface components. Pyroomacoustics [16] focuses on room simulation rather than analysis of measured or pre-computed impulse responses. The Room EQ Wizard (REW) [17] offers free acoustic measurement but primarily targets audio enthusiasts rather than research applications."

The ACE Challenge corpus [18] provides measured RIRs from real rooms with varying acoustic conditions. The MIT IR Survey [19] collected impulse responses from concert halls and other performance venues. More recently, large-scale simulated datasets have emerged, including those generated using geometric acoustic methods [20] and wave-based solvers [21]. The RIRMega collection described in Section 4 contributes to this ecosystem by providing impulse responses with comprehensive metadata including room dimensions, source and receiver positions, surface absorption coefficients, and pre-computed acoustic metrics. This metadata enables filtering and selection based on acoustic properties rather than arbitrary identifiers."

            "content": "The room impulse response h(t) characterizes the linear time-invariant acoustic system formed by room. When source emits signal x(t), the signal received at measurement position is given by the convolution: EDCdB[n] = 10 log10 (cid:19) (cid:18) EDC[n] EDC[0] (4) The reverberation time RT60 is defined as the time required for sound energy to decay by 60 dB. Direct measurement of full 60 dB decay is often impractical due to background noise, so RT60 is typically estimated by extrapolation from smaller decay ranges. 3.2.1 Early Decay Time (EDT) y(t) = x(t) h(t) = (cid:90) x(τ )h(t τ ) dτ (1) The Early Decay Time is derived from the slope of the EDC between 0 dB and 10 dB: In practice, we work with discrete-time signals sampled at rate fs. The discrete impulse response h[n] for = 0, 1, . . . , 1 captures the rooms acoustic behavior up to time = N/fs seconds. The impulse response can be decomposed conceptually into three regions: 1. Direct sound: The initial arrival traveling the shortest path from source to receiver. 2. Early reflections: Discrete arrivals from firstorder and low-order wall reflections, typically within the first 50-80 ms. 3. Late reverberation: The diffuse decay as sound energy reflects many times before being absorbed. This decomposition, while not strictly defined, underlies the perceptual interpretation of many acoustic metrics."

EDT correlates well with subjective perception of reverberance in occupied rooms [7]. 3.2.2 T20 and T30 The T20 and T30 metrics extrapolate RT60 from the decay slopes between 5 and 25 dB, and between 5 and 35 dB, respectively: T20 = 60 m5,25 , T30 = 60 m5, (6) These ranges avoid the initial direct sound and early reflections (above 5 dB) while remaining above typical noise floors (below 35 dB). The slope is obtained through least-squares linear regression.

The impulse response is filtered through bandpass filters before EDC computation.

Higher C80 values indicate greater clarity. Music perception studies suggest optimal values between 2 and +2 dB for symphonic music, with higher values preferred for speech [9]. This proxy follows the approach of Houtgast and Steeneken [10]: STIproxy = 0.15 + 0.85 (0.65 RT + 0.35 RS) (12) where the reverberation term is: RT = 1 1 + (RT60/0.8)1. and the signal-to-noise term is: RS = 1 1 + 10(SN R15)/10 (13) (14) This proxy correlates well with full STI calculations for typical room conditions but should not be used for formal compliance testing. 3.6 Interaural Cross-Correlation Coefficient The Interaural Cross-Correlation Coefficient (IACC) impression created by characterizes the spatial rooms acoustics. It is computed from binaural room impulse responses captured with dummy head or spaced microphone pair. For left and right channel responses hL(t) and hR(t), the IACC is the maximum absolute value of the normalized cross-correlation within range of 1 ms: 3.4.2 Definition D50 Definition measures the fraction of total energy arriving within the first 50 ms: IACC = max τ 1ms (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:82) 0 hL(t)hR(t + τ ) dt (cid:113)(cid:82) L(t) dt (cid:82) 0 h2 0 h2 R(t) dt (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (15) D50 = (cid:82) 50ms h2(t) dt 0 (cid:82) 0 h2(t) dt (11) Values above 0.5 generally indicate good speech intelligibility [8]."

AcoustiVision Pro implements proxy STI measure that approximates the standard calculation using reverberation time and signal-to-noise ratio. 4 The integration limit is typically set to 80 ms for the early IACC, which correlates with apparent source width. Lower IACC values (below 0.5) indicate greater spaciousness and envelopment."

The density of modes increases with frequency; below approximately 4 RT60 1/3 Hz (the Schroeder frequency), individual modes are perceptually distinguishable [11]. sponses, hosted on the Hugging Face platform.1 companion dataset, RIRMega Speech, provides the same impulse responses convolved with speech signals for intelligibility research."

            "content": "Several extensions are planned for future development: Full IEC 60268-16 STI implementation with octave-band modulation transfer functions This paper presented AcoustiVision Pro, an opensource web platform for comprehensive room impulse response analysis. The system implements twelve analysis modes covering temporal, spectral, and spatial acoustic characteristics with mathematical rigor 11 grounded in international standards. The accompanying RIRMega dataset provides thousands of simulated impulse responses with rich metadata for research and educational use. By combining professional-grade acoustic analysis with an accessible web interface, AcoustiVision Pro aims to democratize room acoustics expertise. Architects can evaluate design alternatives without specialized training. Researchers can rapidly analyze large RIR collections. Educators can provide students with hands-on experience in acoustic measurement interpretation. The platform is freely available at https: //huggingface.co/spaces/mandipgoswami/ acoustivision-pro with source released under an open-source license. The RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets are hosted on Hugging Face at the URLs provided in the introduction. code"
