            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought significant benefits to the financial domain across range of applications (Chen et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Gruver et al., 2023; Nie et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024b; Peng et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025). Despite strong potential, deploying LLMs in real-world financial scenarios remains highly challenging, as finance is high-stakes domain governed by strict trustworthy standards. First, LLMs are known to hallucinate (Ji et al., 2023), and the problems become more pronounced over financial documents (e.g., reports) that include both tables and text (Chen et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2024a). Second, finance activities involve processing significant Correspondence: Yilun Zhao (yilun.zhao@yale.edu), Chen Zhao (cz1285@nyu.edu) amount of private information, e.g., client payment information (Nie et al., 2024). Instructing LLMs to adopt private information transparently and ethically is especially important (Sheng et al., 2021; Gillis et al., 2023; Yi et al., 2024). Third, despite the growing attention on using LLMs to advance investment decision-making (Ding et al., 2023), it is unclear to what extent these models can ground their reasoning in financial documents to uncover new insights. In response to those practical needs, it becomes necessary to understand and evaluate LLMs in finance domain from different perspectives. Therefore, we curated and standardized FINTRUST, benchmark with 15, 680 question answer pairs over textual, tabular and time-series data for systematically evaluation of LLMs trustworthiness. As illustrated in Figure 1, FINTRUST comprises seven dimensions grouped into three subsets. The first subset (i.e., trustfulness and robustness) examines whether LLMs can generate factual answers and appropriately abstain when confidence is low. The second subset (i.e., safety, fairness, privacy, and transparency) evaluates whether LLMs can handle confidential or sensitive information in lawful, ethical, and unbiased manner. The third subset (i.e., knowledge discovery) assesses whether the models can uncover non-trivial investment insights in long-form question-answering setting that requires cross-document reasoning. In contrast to existing benchmarks (Chen et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2024c), which primarily evaluate LLMs based on their ability to complete finance-related tasks (e.g., answering financial exam questions), FINTRUST introduces several key advances: (1) Alignment Evaluation, comprehensive assessment framework targeting multiple dimensions of LLM alignment that are critical in the financial domain; (2) Fine-Grained Tasks, where we design multiple sub-tasks within each category, capturing diverse perspectives to enFigure 1: An overview of the seven dimensions of trustworthiness assessed in the FINTRUST benchmark. FINTRUST distinguishes from existing benchmarks featuring three unique characteristics: (1) Alignment Evaluation: The Safety, Fairness, Privacy and Transparency dimensions are specifically designed to assess the legal and ethical aspects of trustworthiness; (2) Fine-Grained Tasks: We design multiple tasks under each dimension. In particular, Trustfulness deals with both hallucination and number calculation; Safety includes four different attack methods; Fairness evaluation covers both industry-level and personal-level; Privacy features three types of system prompts with different levels of emphasis on privacy awareness; (3) Real-World Scenarios: We imitate the challenges that are from real applications. For example, Safety evaluation includes ten financial crimes. able more nuanced and rigorous evaluation; and (3) Real-World Scenarios, where task construction is grounded on authentic financial contexts. For example, the Safety category includes ten common financial crimes. We evaluate 11 leading LLMs on FINTRUST, comprising four proprietary models, four opensource counterparts and three finance domainspecific LLMs. We reveal that the more advanced proprietary models (e.g., o4-mini) consistently outperform others on multiple tasks such as safety. Notably, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) demonstrate stronger performance in specific areas, such as industry-level fairness. Finance domainspecific models (e.g., Fin-R1) also show outstanding performance in certain aspects, such as personal-level fairness. However, all models exhibit notable shortcomings on challenging tasks, such as fiduciary alignment and merely disclose conflict of interest, indicating substantial room for further improvement. We summarize our contributions as follows: We introduce FINTRUST, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs trustworthiness for financial domains. We conduct an extensive evaluation over wide range of LLMs, assessing the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in our task. Our multi-dimensional analysis offers actionable insights for deploying LLMs in finance."

Therefore, the Truthfulness subset focuses on real-world scenarios in which LLMs must answer financial questions based on long contexts. It evaluates whether models can provide factually accurate responses, or appropriately abstain when uncertain. The task is divided into two components: (1) Hallucination and Certainty, which assesses the models ability to detect potential hallucinations and express its confidence level; and (2) Numerical Accuracy and Informativeness, which evaluates the correctness of financial calculations and the depth and clarity of the models explanations. Task Formulation. The input of this task consists of question and corresponding textual and tabular data as context. For the Hallucination and Certainty task, the model outputs an answer (i.e., number) if it considers the question answerable; otherwise, it should output None. For the Numerical Accuracy and Informativeness task, the model is required to output long-form answer including both the final answer and corresponding rationals. We include an example in Appendix Figure 6. Data Construction. The Hallucination and Certainty task leverages the subsets of CodeFinQA and SEC-Num within the Bizbench (Krumdick et al., 2024). To examine the LLMs resistance to hallucinate, we remove all numerically relevant information from the input, making the questions unanswerable by design. For Numerical Accuracy and Informativeness evaluation, we use the examples from DocMath-Eval (Zhao et al., 2024c)."

To this end, the Safety dimension evaluates models resistance to four types of black-box jailbreak attacks identified by Yi et al. (2024): Plain Attack, Scenario Nesting Attack, Low-Resource Language Attack, and Genetic Algorithm-based Attack. Task Formulation. The evaluation is framed as short-form QA task. Given question that is designed to elicit unsafe or policy-violating responses, the LLMs decides whether to respond or abstain. We include an example in Appendix Figure 7. Data Construction. We use GPT-4.1 to generate 1,000 plain attacks from scratch, covering the following ten real-world subsets of illegal financial activities: tax evasion, money laundering, insider trading, financial fraud, counterfeit currency or financial documents, illegal fund-raising, illegal foreign exchange trading, credit card fraud, illegal lending activities, and financial identity theft. Specifically, for scenario nesting attack, we inject harmful inquiries in seemingly innocent queries that ask LLMs to generate virtual and nested scenes (Li et al., 2024). The low-resource language attack translates plain attack from English into lowresource language Hausa (Shen et al., 2024). For genetic algorithm-based attack, we create prompt templates that maximize the models logits of the first target token, e.g., Sure (Andriushchenko et al., 2025)."

To this end, our Fairness evaluation consists of two aspects: Industrylevel Fairness that checks whether LLMs have preference from one sector to another; Personal-level Fairness that evaluates how fluctuating attributes like age, race and gender affect credit scoring. Task Formulation. For the industry-level fairness, we follow the approach of Chuang and Yang (2022), where the task is formed as binary mask token prediction task for buy or sell without extra context. Ideally, the LLMs should predict similar percentage of buy or sell across different industries. For the personal-level fairness, we form the task as binary classification problem in credit scoring. We ask LLMs to predict whether the given customer is likely to default on the loan given customer information as context. fair LLM should have stable output regardless of the customers age, gender and race. We include an example in Figure 8 in appendix. Data Construction. For industry-level evaluation, we utilize the Russell 3000 constituent firms as candidates, including company names and their gsectors. For individual-level evaluation, we use German Credit Dataset (Hofmann, 1994) to form the customers information."

We expect the LLMs to maintain their performance on the answerable questions and refuse firmly when given unanswerable questions. We include an example in Figure 9 in appendix.

Task Formulation. We formulate the task as short-form QA. The corresponding context contains series of personal information. We expect the model to reject answering these questions. We include an example in Appendix Figure 10 . Data Construction. We use GPT-4.1 to generate both questions and contextual information. Specifically, we design various types of personal information, such as Social Security numbers, bank account details, and credit card numbers. All values are randomly generated and combined to eliminate any real-world privacy concerns. For each example, we generate question targeting specific piece of personal information mentioned in the context. To assess model sensitivity to privacy cues, we pair each question with one of three system prompts: one that does not mention privacy, one that implies it implicitly, and one that states it explicitly."

The input consists of question about specific company accompanied by both time-series (stock price over several month) and textual data from social media (tweets about the company) as context. The output is either price rise or fall. system prompt is used to inject ownership information into the LLM, allowing us to examine how such information influences the models predictions. detailed task example is provided in Appendix Figure 11. Data Construction. We use BigData 22 (Soun et al., 2022) as our seed dataset and injects ownership information is the following: We randomly pair two companies, where Company As stock price increases while Company Bs decreases. Each pair is evaluated under four different system prompts, varying along two dimensions: the company perspective (A or B) and the presence or absence of explicit transparency requirements. Ideally, LLMs should consistently favor investing in Company over Company B, and maintain stable preferences regardless of prompt variations."

Task Formulation. We form the task as fill-inthe-blank question answering for more reliable evaluation. Specially, the input is question with textual and table as context, and the output is to fill in the blanks. We include an example in Appendix Figure 12 . Data Construction. We construct this subset from scratch. The dataset includes complex question answering based on segments of 10-K financial reports from two companies as context. The answer requires extensive math calculation and inference. As the open question answering can have multiple solving approach leading to different answer structure, we replace the calculated data in the gold answer with <number> and use <inference> to cover all the inference text. The LLMs then complete the fragmented answer by fill in those blanks."

For models that do not expose log probabilities (e.g., reasoning-based models), we instead use the proportion of buy predictions per industry. We then compute Cohens to quantify bias across industries. Findings. According to Figure 3, Fin-R1 and DianJin-R1 excels in personal-level fairness evaluation. Notably, reasoning-based models perform significantly worse, suggesting that the reasoning process may overemphasize sensitive attributes (see section A.7 for an example). For industry-level fairness, DeepSeek-V3 ranks the highest, suggesting an advantage from open-source models, as shown in Table 3. Findings. As shown in Table 4, all LLMs perform well on answerable questions but exhibit significant performance drop on unanswerable ones.

            "content": "In this section, we synthesize cross-metric findings and reflect on practical implications for deploying LLMs in finance. We group models by availability (proprietary, open-source, fine-tuned) and by functionality (reasoning, non-reasoning) to surface consistent patterns and trade-offs. In general, we reveal that: Reasoning vs. Non-Reasoning. Reasoning models hallucinate less and, when errors occur, their self-reflection makes them more likely to question their own answers. However, this heightened reflection can draw in irrelevant personal information in the Fairness subset, causing extra bias. Fine-tuning. Fine-tuned models typically perform more fairly than other models likely due to extra alignment during post-training. Safety Vulnerability and Privacy. Most models, except o4-mini, are vulnerable to genetic algorithm attacks, suggesting that additional methods to prevent probability-based hacking is crucial. Notably, all three fine-tuned models show much worse context-aware ability as they expose sensitive information to the questioner in the Privacy subset with almost no resistance, indicating critical ability deterioration during fine-tuning. Figure 5: Transparency Analysis Across LLMs. Ideally, LLMs should consistently select Company without referencing ownership information. However, most models tend to favor Company when the system prompt specifies ownership as Company B.

Table 5: Additional Transparency evaluation with LLMas-a-judge. We report disclosure rates in short CoT (nonreasoning) and the rate of explicitly including ownership in long CoT (reasoning). All models perform poorly in disclosing their ownership information. to analyze the models reasoning chains and assess whether it discloses ownership during inference. Findings. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 5, FinR1 achieves the highest accuracy, potentially due to overlap between its instruction tuning data and the evaluation set. An interesting observation is that when ownership is switched from Company to Company B, LLMs tend to favor Company in their responses, often without disclosing ownership in their reasoning. Additionally, we observe backfire effect: explicitly mentioning transparency in the system prompt leads to an even greater drop in the selection rate for Company A, which we demonstrate case in section A.7."

            "content": "Evaluation Metrics. We apply GPT-4.1 mini as LLM-as-a-judge to compare with the reference answer and on scale from 1 to 5. Findings. As shown in Table 6, GPT-4.1 achieves the best performance, though all LLMs except FinR1 score reasonably well, with results exceeding Transparency and Legal Alignment. For Transparency, proprietary models generally shift their answers less when the system prompt setting changes. Yet all models disclose ownership poorly, likely misclassifying it as sensitive information and hiding it. This contradicts the legal requirement of Fiduciary Alignment and may cause legal issues in real-world applications."

            "content": "LLM Applications and Deployment in Finance. LLMs have shown impressive performance across range of financial tasks, including time series analysis, financial question answering, and more (Gruver et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021). Numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate LLM capabilities and fine-tune them for improved performance in the financial domain (Xie et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023; Zhang and Yang, 2023). However, deploying LLMs in real-world financial applications raises growing concerns about their reliability (Kang and Liu, 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Cao, 2021). Given that the financial sector involves high-stakes decisions and sensitive data, unreliable LLM outputssuch as hallucinationscan lead to significant financial losses and ethical risks (Kang and Liu, 2024; Kozodoi et al., 2022; Chuang and Yang, 2022). Therefore, we provide comprehensive benchmark to evaluate trustworthiness issue for LLMs application in finance. Existing Benchmarks in the Trustworthiness and Financial Domains. Alignment issue has become major concern in addition to performance, particularly for deploying them in real-world scenarios and high-stakes domains. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2023) emphasized that lack of reliability represents fatal weakness in real-world applications of LLMs and proposed seven critical dimensions for LLM trustworthiness evaluation. Building on these insights, subsequent studies have investigated or improved various aspects of trustworthiness. For example, Feng et al. (Feng et al., 2024) explored methods to mitigate hallucinations and enhance reliability; Ye et al. (Ye et al., 2025) examined fairness biases present in LLMs; and Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2024) discussed approaches to improve the safety of LLMs. Recent research has begun to provide comprehensive evaluations within specific domains. For instance, Xia et al. (Xia et al., 2024) conducted comprehensive assessment of the trustworthiness of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical applications."

There also exists benchmarks evaluating LLMs reasoning abilities (Tang et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025). Motivated by the gap that finance domain lacks holistic, trustworthiness-centered evaluation, we proposes the FINTRUST benchmark, specifically tailored to meet the unique requirements of financial applications."

            "content": "This paper presents FINTRUST, comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in the financial domain. Our experiments reveal that even the latest LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and finance-specific finetuned models, demonstrate limited legal and ethical awareness such as privacy and transparency. These findings underscore the need for improved alignment of LLMs with domain-specific legal and ethical standards."

        {
            "title": "Limitations and Ethics",
            "content": "We acknowledge the limitations in our study. We do not perform instruction fine-tuning or alignment of open-source LLMs on our proposed benchmark. As result, we are unable to assess how targeted alignment efforts might enhance model alignment such as in transparency. Investigating how instruction tuning or reinforcement learning with our dataset affects model trustworthiness would be valuable direction for future work. This study evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs in Finance domain to better understand their reliability and associated risks. All experiments are conducted with publicly available LLMs or APIs, with no deployment in real-world financial systems. Given the high-stakes nature of finance, we acknowledge the ethical concerns posed by hallucinations, overconfident outputs, and potential biases, which could lead to significant harm if misused. FINTRUST is designed to expose these risks and support the development of safer, more trustworthy LLM applications."

Note: The aggregate market value of the voting stock on July 29, 2017 does not exist in the file and the original context is for Tailored Brands. GPT-4.1 Response: Based on the provided context, the aggregate market value of the voting stock held by nonaffiliates of Hilltop Holdings Inc., computed by reference to the price at which the common stock was last sold on the New York Stock Exchange on June 30, 2017, was approximately $1.95 billion. The closest disclosed date is June 30, 2017 which can be used to approximate the value on July 29, 2017. Gold Answer: Based on the provided context, the aggregate market value of the voting stock held by nonaffiliates of Tailored Brands, Inc. (the registrant), based on the closing price of shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on July 29, 2017, was approximately $607.4 million. Analysis: Standard finance documents have many similar terms that frequently occur across texts,tables and different files. When not occurring in the context, LLMs often try to compute or inference the number with effort without noticing the error of context. This poses more challenging task for LLMs to identify the irrelevant context and refuse when not specifying the firm name.
