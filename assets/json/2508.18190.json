They often serve as\nthe major type in these applications, e.g., accounting for up to 80%\nof patient records in Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems [2].\nFor better understanding, in Figure 1, we showcase five exam-\nple semi-structured tables with corresponding user questions from",
            "content": "1 diverse scenarios (e.g., human resource management, financial management, and personal information). Considering the bottom-right table (TD-Tech): (𝑖) the top portion covers the companys fundamental details, while (𝑖𝑖) the lower portion contains basic information and performance ratings of employees per department. Different shades of blue in TD-Tech highlight the nested levels of the table, reflecting relationships like hierarchical headers (e.g., the Basic Info header linked to lower-level headers like Company and TEL) and header-to-content (e.g., both Department and Level headers own the content values of As). Even human analysts may need to carefully analyze the layout characters to fully understand such semi-structured tables. This layout flexibility makes semi-structured table QA extremely challenging and distinguishes it from other common QA tasks on structured data (e.g., relational tables [12]) and unstructured data (e.g., textual documents or multimedia files [7]). In Figure 1, we showcase semi-structured table questions that commonly require the following analysis strategies: (𝑖) Identify the headers based on the user question to locate the areas of relevant table cells. For instance, 𝑄8 first identifies the Level header in the Employee Info sub-table, and then recognizes the A+ cells. Meanwhile, it is essential to distinguish that the content value under the Department header is different from Level in the original question. (𝑖𝑖) Leverage the identified cells and the original question to analyze the surrounding table structures for capturing nested relationships and extracting additional information. For instance, for 𝑄9, the merged cell A+ applies to two employees to get the right answer 2. (𝑖𝑖𝑖) Explore all potentially relevant header and content cells required to form an accurate answer. For instance, for 𝑄10, relevant information about the company is needed for summarization. Existing works (including powerful LLMs like GPT4-o[29] and DeepSeek-R1 [13]) face significant limitations in semi-structured table QA. First, NL2SQL methods [8, 10, 16, 34, 35, 41] generate SQL statements executed on relational tables to get the final answer. However, it requires converting semi-structured tables into fully structured formats, causing substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code [43] generate python code to operate on pandas dataframes. However, they struggle to understand many complex semi-structured tables and conduct precise information retrieval. more promising approach involves converting tables into images for processing with Vision Language Models (VLM) [20, 47]. But it has three main limitations: (𝑖) Table2image causes precise loss and often misleads to irrelevant table areas; (𝑖𝑖) It requires extensive fine-tuning on QA tasks and has poor generalization ability; (𝑖𝑖𝑖) It cannot work for relatively large tables those with over 100+ rows (see more analysis in Section 2.3). There are several challenges in achieving automatic semistructured table QA. First, understanding the structure of semistructured tables involves two main problems: (𝑖) how to distinguish header and content cells that could distribute in any areas of the table, which involves semantic understanding (e.g., in the bottomright table of Figure 1, the cells under department and level headers) and cannot be handled by rule-based matching approaches [9]; (𝑖𝑖) how to understand the nested or containment relationships across the header and content cells, where the same question to different cell relationships could lead to different answers. For instance, in the bottom-right table of Figure 1, when splitting the merged cell of department A, the answer to the question what is the second department would be department instead of (C1). Second, due to the complexity of semi-structured table layouts, answering questions over such tables can be challenging, often requiring variety of analytical tricks. For instance, we may need to apply both left-to-right and top-to-down lookup strategies (e.g., identifying departments in the bottom-right table of Figure 1 by referencing the top-level title header, the left Employee Info header, and the nested Department header). Conversely, we may sometimes need to examine the content cells to identify the relevant headers (i.e., bottom-up lookup), which makes the semi-structured table QA procedure even more complicated (C2). Third, an effective validation mechanism for semi-structured table QA remains absent, which is especially crucial for resolving issues such as hallucination in LLMs [10, 34]. In related tasks like NL2SQL, many methods do not validate the accuracy of generated answers and thus produce the final result in single shot. Others merely check whether executing the SQL statements yields result tables sufficient to answer the question. However, in semi-structured table QA, the retrieved cells can (𝑖) still involve complex semi-structured layouts (e.g., single cell may contain multi-row text or even nested sub-table) and (𝑖𝑖) be derived through multiple lookups, making it difficult for general LLMs to verify the accuracy of these retrieved semi-structured table cells (C3). To address these challenges, we propose novel semi-structured table QA framework (ST-Raptor). First, we introduce graph model (HO-Tree) to represent semi-structured table layouts, with nodes denoting table headers / content values and edges capturing their hierarchical and containment relationships. This model also includes nine basic tree operations, covering most common QA tasks and addressing the structural complexity challenge (for C1). Second, we present an effective HO-Tree construction strategy: (1) multi-modal LLM identifies semi-structured table headers, (2) heuristic rules separate the semi-structured table into basic table units based on the identified headers, and (3) depth-first search (DFS) algorithm constructs the HO-Tree. This stage addresses the difficulty of accurately representing the complex implicit relations of semi-structured tables. Third, we propose question decomposition method with two key techniques: (1) semantic alignment between the input question and the derived operation pipeline, and (2) column-type-aware tagging approach that annotates discrete, continuous, and unstructured columns (e.g., listing [man, woman] for sex column) to enhance data retrieval accuracy (for C2). Finally, we introduce two-stage QA verification mechanism to ensure solution stability. The first stage checks constraints (e.g., non-empty, question-related) to validate the generated operations and their execution results. The second stage provides confidence score by comparing the original questions with those derived from the final answers (for C3). We summarize our contributions as follows: (1) We present novel framework that enables effective and robust semi-structured table QA using large language models. (2) We provide tree-based representation method for semi-structured tables (HO-Tree), and design basic tree operations in the model to support common QA tasks. 2 (3) We propose DFS-based algorithm that combines VLM and heuristic rules to construct HO-Tree from semi-structured table. (4) We design question decomposition strategy that ensures semantic alignment with the generated operation pipelines, and introduce column-type-aware tagging strategy to improve lookup accuracy on relatively large semi-structured tables. (5) We propose two-stage QA verification mechanism that conducts constraint examinations and compares the pipelines of the origin question and those derived from the final answer. (6) We curate the SSTQA dataset, featuring 102 diverse semi-structured tables and 764 representative queries commonly found in real-world scenarios. (7) We conduct thorough evaluations to verify ST-Raptor can effectively tackle the structural and semantic complexities of semistructured tables, resulting in improved QA accuracy and reliability."

            "title": "2.1 Semi-Structured Tables\nSemi-structured tables can be far more complex than structured\nones due to the combination of diverse table layouts. However, com-\npared with other semi-structured data, they still adhere to stricter\nlayout constraints and may suffer information loss when stored in\nformats like JSON (e.g., splitting merged cells). To preserve their\nstructure, richer formats like HTML [31] are required. Furthermore,\nquestions over such tables often demand precise layout-aware rea-\nsoning (e.g., interpreting layout constraints) and operator ground-\ning (e.g., identifying the intersection of relevant rows and columns).\nCore Elements. In a semi-structured table 𝑇 , a table cell is the\natomic unit of a semi-structured table (e.g., the intersection of one\nrow and column). A table header consists of one or more rows\nor columns that label the table body. A merged cell spans multi-\nple adjacent rows or columns to convey hierarchical information.\nA subtable is a semantically and structurally self-contained table\nembedded within a parent table with at least one level of nested\nheaders, rows, and internal layout.\nTable Layouts. The semi-structured table 𝑇 (in standard form and\nignoring issues likes data cleaning [6]) can be composed of four\ntypical layouts (independent with each other):\n(L.1) Header-Single-Value. The simplest layout pairs a header\n𝐻 = ℎ1 with a single content value 𝑉 = 𝑣1, arranged either vertically\nor horizontal: 𝑇𝑡 = { 𝐻 = ℎ1, 𝑉 = 𝑣1, 𝐻 → 𝑉 } . For instance, in\nTable 1, the atomic header “Name” is associated with the single value\n“Albert”, demonstrating this minimal semi-structured table layout.\n(L.2) Header-Multiple-Values. A more prevalent structure in semi-\nstructured table is an atomic or hierarchical header 𝐻 = ℎ1 accom-\npanied by a list of values 𝑉 = [ 𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛 ]. We represent this as\n𝑇𝑡 = { 𝐻 = ℎ1, 𝑉 = [ 𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛 ], 𝐻 → 𝑉 } . For instance, Table 1\npresents an example in which the atomic header “Name” corresponds\nto multiple values, specifically the list [ “Albert”, “Tim”, “Jack” ].\n(L.3) Orthogonal-Subtables.

Suppose we have 𝑛 such subtables 𝑇1, 𝑇2, . . . , 𝑇𝑛. We represent their orthogonal combination as 𝑇 = (cid:111) (cid:110) 𝐻 =[ 𝐻1, 𝐻2, . . . , 𝐻𝑛 ], 𝑇 =[ 𝑇1,𝑇2, . . . ,𝑇𝑛 ], 𝐻𝑖 𝑇𝑖, 1 𝑖 𝑛 . For instance, as demonstrated in Table 1, the three atomic-headersingle-value tables are combined in Orthogonal-Table layout. (L.4) Header-Orthogonal-Subtables. Header-Orthogonal-Subtables consists of an atomic or hierarchical header paired with one or more orthogonal-subtables ((L.3)), which means all orthogonal-subtables in (L.4) share the same header. Formally, let the grouped subtables be 𝑇1,𝑇2, . . . ,𝑇𝑛. We represent (cid:111) this layout as 𝑇𝑡 = . For instance, in Table 1, the header Info groups two orthogonal subtables (i.e., Name and Age subtables) that each follows the Header-Multiple-Value layout. (cid:110) 𝐻 =𝐻 p,𝑇 =[ 𝑇1,𝑇2, . . . ,𝑇𝑛 ], 𝐻 p𝑇𝑖, 1 𝑖 𝑛 subtable 𝑇sub 𝑇 follows one or combination of the above layouts. Note that: (1) we do not consider irregular layouts, such as content values presented without corresponding headers [4]; (2) unlike structured tables, common semi-structured tables (e.g., Word tables, transaction records) are relatively small (e.g., tables with over 100 rows are already considered large); (3) we assume the tables are error-free, and issues such as table cleaning (e.g., missing value imputation [5]) are beyond the scope of this paper. Example 2.1. For the bottom-right semi-structured table in Figure 1, we can extract two orthogonal subtables sharing common header TD Tech (𝐿.4 𝐿.3). Within the Employee Info subtable, we can extract four header-multiple-values subtables (𝐿.3[𝐿21, . . . , 𝐿24]). In this way, we can recursively traverse the entire structures through 𝐿.4𝐿.3[𝐿.4{𝐿.11, . . . , 𝐿.14}, 𝐿.4𝐿.3[𝐿.2[1], . . . , 𝐿.2[4]]]. Furthermore, the one-to-many relationships between these subtables motivate us to adopt tree-based strategy to represent semistructured tables (see Section 4)."

            "content": "Definition 1 (Semi-Structured Table QA). Let 𝑇 be semistructured table with multi-layered organization, and let 𝑄 be question that may reference one or multiple subtables in 𝑇 . SemiStructured Table QA is defined as mapping (𝑇 , 𝑄) 𝐴, where the answer 𝐴 is derived by identifying the subtables {𝑇sub 𝑇sub 𝑇 } relevant to 𝑄. 3 Figure 2: Error Distribution GPT-4o is evaluated on both HTML and structured (JSON) formats; ReAcTable (NL2SQL) converts semistructured tables into structured representations; while TableLLaVA utilizes LVM to process them as images. QA Tasks. Commonly, QA tasks in this problem often require understanding the layouts of target semi-structured tables. Here we showcase three typical QA tasks together with relevant layouts. (1) Numerical Computation. The question 𝑄2 in Figure ?? requests the age of the oldest employee (Header-Multiple-Values in L.2). Correctly answering it involves (𝑖) locating the target column Age within the hierarchical header Info, (𝑖𝑖) extracting all age values from the corresponding records, and (𝑖𝑖𝑖) computing the maximum value from the retrieved data. Such QA requires accurate header identification and data retrieval, upon which we can easily apply basic computational functions to get accurate results. (2) Information Extraction. The question 𝑄1 in Figure ?? relies on the Employee Info layout (Header-Orthogonal-Tables in L.4). To derive the correct answer 2, we must extract the records of employees meeting the rating condition and aggregate them. Failure to properly interpret the semantic relationship between the merged cell A+ and its associated employees may lead to wrong answer. (3) Summarization. The question 𝑄3 in Figure ?? requests summary of the companys basic information (Orthogonal-Tables in L.3). Addressing this question involves two critical steps: (𝑖) identifying and extracting the semantically relevant table segments corresponding to the question, and (𝑖𝑖) leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate coherent summary from the retrieved data. The key challenge lies in robustly interpreting complex table layouts to ensure precise alignment between the question intent and the extracted data to generate accurate summaries."

            "content": "4 LLMs face significant challenges in effectively interpreting complex table layouts. In contrast, image-based methods exhibit the lowest layout understanding error among wrong answers (31.58% compared to 35.48% for GPT-4o with structured input, 44.82% for GPT-4o with HTML input, and 61.67% for NL2Code agent), but own relatively low overall accuracy caused by the following two limitations. This observation motivates us to design proper semistructured table representation method that simultaneously stores the structural information and content of semi-structured tables. (Limitation 2) Inaccurate Table Data Retrieval. As shown in Figure 2, data retrieval errors constitute substantial proportion of failures. Specifically, the four methods (i.e., GPT-4o with structured input, GPT-4o with HTML input, NL2Code agent, and visionlanguage model) exhibit retrieval error rates of 55.17%, 54.84%, 76.67%, and 61.84%, respectively, which are primarily due to their inability to identify question-relevant tabular data. Among these methods, GPT-4o achieves superior performance, attributable to its advanced contextual comprehension capabilities. In contrast, the agent-based approach, which operates on structured table representations using external tools, incurs significant information loss during structural transformation. We observe that (1) these methods lack robust data retrieval mechanisms, and (2) vanilla LLMs struggle to accurately locate target table content, likely due to inherent limitations in semantic understanding. This indicates that significant improvements remain achievable in accurately locating and retrieving question-relevant content in semi-structured tables. (Limitation 3) Question Comprehension Errors. Question comprehension errors occur when model misinterprets the semantics of question and consequently retrieves incorrect answers from semi-structured tables, often due to inadequate integration of table layout and content. VLMs demonstrate the weakest performance, mainly due to their weak understanding of rich-text images. In contrast, both GPT-4o and agent-based methods demonstrate better performance, benefiting from the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, their remaining errors are predominantly attributable to the failure to align the semantics of the input question with complex semi-structured table layouts, motivating us to design tailored question decomposition and table semantic alignment techniques for semi-structured tables."

Both metadata and data components may exhibit hierarchical and orthogonal structures. Given this inherent one-tomany organization, we model them using trees: one for metadata and one for data. In each, nodes store metadata or content values, while edges encode containment or orthogonal relationships. Definition 2 (Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (𝐻𝑂-𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒)). Given semi-structured table 𝑇 , we model 𝑇 into HO-Tree that links the metadata with corresponding content values by pointing the leaf node in the 𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 to each level of 𝐵𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒, representing the association between metadata and the corresponding table column: (1) Meta Tree (𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒).

Moreover, hierarchical containment may exist among these trees, where one 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 can serve as the value of node within another 𝐵𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒. Example 4.1. The right part of Figure 4 illustrates an example of HO-Tree, where TD Tech serves as the top-level cell. This cell is stored in single-node 𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒, which points to the remaining structure stored in 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒. The subsequent 𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 contains two 𝑀𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 instances (i.e., Basic Info and Employee Info), each referencing distinct 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒, with each 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 storing sub 𝐻𝑂-𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒."

Then, we prompt the VLM to output all possible keys that would be present in JSON-formatted representation of the table as the candidate meta-information cell values. Subsequently, we calculate similarity scores between candidates and all table cells using embeddingbased similarity metrics. Cells exceeding predefined threshold are identified as meta-information, and their positions guide the subsequent table partitioning process."

            "content": "We introduce three principles to guide the HO-Tree construction process by interpreting different layouts in semi-structured tables: (Principle 1) Top-Level Header Identification. If merged cell spans an entire row or column, it is treated as header in HeaderOrthogonal-Tables layout (𝐿.4), and adjacent cells (below or to the right) are interpreted as subtable. (Principle 2) Header-Content Differentiation. When both topaligned and left-aligned headers are present, the one with more cells is selected to construct the 𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒, while the other is integrated into the 𝐵𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒. (Principle 3) Orthogonal Table Identification. When OrthogonalTables (𝐿.3) are detected, we segment them and process each subtable recursively and sequentially. As illustrated in Figure 4, applying these principles enables table partitioning based on meta-information locations and the recursive construction of HO-Trees for semi-structured tables."

            "content": "Unlike structured tables with fixed schemas, semi-structured tables often exhibit complex and irregular nesting, posing challenges for meta-information extraction. Rule-based approaches fail to capture such nuances, especially when similar structural patterns represent different semantics. Serializing tables (e.g., as images or structured formats) allows prompting models for metadata extraction or format generation. However, LLMs trained on 1D text struggle with 2D tables [23], often exhibiting issues like hallucination and the Lost in the Middle effect [27], undermining consistency and reliability. An HO-Tree is then constructed for each subtable according to its identified layout type: for layouts 𝐿.1 and 𝐿.2, the HO-Tree is built directly; otherwise, recursive DFS is applied. For example, in Figure 4, the vertically structured semi-structured tables demonstrate top-down alignment of metadata and content. Based on the detected metadata, the table is partitioned into list of subtables following predefined principles. An HO-Tree is then constructed for each subtable according to its identified layout type: for layouts 𝐿.1 and 𝐿.2, the HO-Tree is built directly; 6 otherwise, recursive DFS is applied. Take the vertically structured semi-structured tables where metadata and content are aligned topdown in Figure 4 as an example: (1) In the 𝑀𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒, each root-toleaf path represents column, and the tree grows vertically to reflect vertical relationships among metadata. (2) In the 𝐵𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒, each path represents row, with horizontally aligned attributes, so the tree grows horizontally. Each leaf node in the 𝑀𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒 points to corresponding level in the 𝐵𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒, linking metadata to the associated content column. During DFS backtracking, we model Orthogonal-Tables and Header-Orthogonal-Tables layouts (i.e., 𝐿.3 and 𝐿.4). In such cases, node in the 𝐵𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒 may recursively contain another HO-Tree as its value. Algorithm 1 outlines the HO-Tree construction process. VLMs identify table headers via the 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝐼𝑛𝑓 𝑜𝐷𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡 function (Section 4.2.1). Using the extracted metadata and predefined principles, the table is partitioned into subtables through the 𝑇 𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡 function (Section 4.2.2). To address structural complexity, each subtable is transformed into an HO-Tree via the 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒 function (Section 4.2.3) and recursively merged using depth-first search to reconstruct the full structure of the original semi-structured table. Example 4.2. Figure 4 illustrates the construction of three-level nested HO-Tree. The Basic Info subtable is initially misidentified by the VLM as Basic Information and corrected by alignment. Metadata is used to identify the 𝐿.4 𝐿.3 layout, guiding the partition of the Basic Info subtable into 𝑀𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 and sub-𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 (constructing 𝐿.4). Finally, the leaf nodes of the 𝑀𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒 in subtree link to corresponding levels of the 𝐵𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 (constructing 𝐿.3). 5 Pipeline-based Question Answering With the HO-Tree model in place, it poses three key challenges in question answering over semi-structured tables. First, such questions often require multi-hop reasoning rather than one-shot retrieval, and unlike NL2SQL tasks, lack standardized operation set for pipeline construction. Second, answering necessitates hybrid traversal strategies (e.g., left-to-right, top-down, bottom-up) to locate relevant content. Third, the large number of cells in some semistructured tables complicates the precise identification of questionrelevant information. To address these challenges, we propose pipeline-based QA strategy centered on set of tree-specific operations that cover most QA scenarios: (1) question decomposition method for complex multi-hop queries, (2) an operation generation mechanism with parameter-content alignment, and (3) column-type-aware tagging mechanism that annotates columns based on data characteristics, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval from large, complex tables."

The operations fall into four cate-\ngories: (1) Data Retrieval Operations, which retrieve relevant values\nfrom the tree; (2) Data Manipulation Operations, which process or\ntransform retrieved data; (3) Alignment Operations, which align\noperation parameters with table content; (4) Semantic Reasoning\nOperations, which invoke LLMs for contextual inference.",
            "content": "7 For any user question, we first decompose it into one or more sub-questions, each resolved through sequence of operations to retrieve relevant information or derive the answer. Ideally, the generated operation pipeline includes: (1) retrieval to collect nonredundant data, (2) manipulation to structure the data into model comprehensible form, (3) alignment to ensure question-content alignment, and (4) reasoning to produce the final answer. In worstcase scenarios, the model may retrieve nearly the entire table and rely heavily on reasoning, highlighting the need for fine-grained, modular operation design. Data Retrieval Operation. These operations are responsible for extracting relevant table content from the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 based on arguments derived from the user question. Children Retrieval (𝐶𝐻𝐿(𝑉 )) This operation retrieves all successor nodes of any node whose value matches 𝑉 . If multiple such nodes exist, each set of successors is returned separately. Use the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 in Figure 4 as an example, 𝐶𝐻𝐿(𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑐 𝐼𝑛𝑓 𝑜) returns the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 containing the company information. Father Retrieval (𝐹𝐴𝑇 (𝑉 )) This operation is used to obtain the set of ancestor nodes of given tree node. For instance, in Figure 4, 𝐹𝐴𝑇 (𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡) would return the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 containing the employee information. Value Retrieval (𝐸𝑋𝑇 (𝑉1, 𝑉2)) This operation is used to find nodes in certain layer of 𝐵𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 pointed to by 𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 leaf node, while giving them common ancestor 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 as filtering criterion. Specifically, one of 𝑉1 and 𝑉2 needs to be 𝑀𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 value, and the other needs to be 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 value. Assume that 𝑉1 is the 𝑀𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 value and 𝑉2 is the 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 value, the operation returns set of node values that satisfy the following: (1) The 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 is in the 𝑀𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒 column 𝑉1 (2) 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 with value 𝑉2 is an ancestor of the 𝐵𝑁𝑜𝑑𝑒 in 𝑀𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒 column. Data Manipulation Operation is used to perform specific operations on the data, including filtering based on conditions, performing calculations, and making comparisons. Condition (𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑑 (𝐷, 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐)) filters data set 𝐷 using predicate function 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐 and returns the filtered values or new 𝐻𝑂-𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒. For instance, 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝐸𝑋𝑇 (𝐿𝑖𝑙𝑦, 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒), 𝑑𝑒 𝑓 (𝑥) : 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑥 < 60) retrieves Lilys grades that are less than 60. Calculation (𝑀𝑎𝑡ℎ(𝐷, 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐)) applies numerical computation function 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐 over data set 𝐷. For instance, 𝑀𝑎𝑡ℎ(𝐶𝐻𝐿(𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒), 𝑑𝑒 𝑓 (𝑥) : 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑠𝑢𝑚(𝑥)) returns the sum of the column Price. Compare (𝐶𝑚𝑝 (𝐷1, 𝐷2, 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐)) compares two data sets 𝐷1 and 𝐷2 using function 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐, and returns the boolean result. For instance, 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒 (𝐸𝑋𝑇 (𝐿𝑖𝑙𝑦, 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒), 𝐸𝑋𝑇 (𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑦, 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒), 𝑑𝑒 𝑓 (𝑥1, 𝑥2) : 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑥1 > 𝑥2 returns the truth value of the statement Lilys grade is greater than Cindys. Execute (𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ(𝐷, 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐)) applies function 𝐹𝑢𝑛𝑐 to each element in data set 𝐷 and returns the resulting set. For instance, 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ(𝐸𝑋𝑇 (𝐿𝑖𝑙𝑦, 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒), 𝑑𝑒 𝑓 (𝑥) 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑥10) retrieves all Lilys grades and returns the values after minus ten. Alignment Operation aims to ensure consistency between operation parameters and the content of the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒. Align (𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑃, 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒)) This operation aligns the parameters 𝑃 in given operation with the nodes in the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒 using Figure 5: Question Decomposition and Pipeline Generation. an embedding-based similarity model [39]. The process involves computing embeddings for the parameters and table content: (1) 𝐸𝑎 = 𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑 (𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) 𝐸𝑐 = 𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑 (𝑐1, 𝑐2, . . . , 𝑐𝑚) 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥 = 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐸𝑎, 𝐸𝑐 ) (3) where 𝑎𝑖 represents the 𝑖-th parameter and 𝑐 𝑗 denotes the content of the 𝑗-th node in the tree, with 𝑚 representing the total number of nodes. Cosine similarity (𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑆𝑖𝑚) is used to identify the most semantically aligned table node for each parameter, which is then used for downstream operations. (2) Example 5.1. For the operation 𝐶𝐻𝐿(𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑓 𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛), if the metainformation of the table is [ID, Name, Age], the alignment operation 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝐼𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 𝑓 𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, 𝐻𝑂𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒) attempts to output ID to align the operation parameter to the table content. Semantic Reasoning Operation leverages LLMs for high-level reasoning over retrieved data. Reason (𝑅𝑒𝑎(𝑄, 𝐷)) This operation takes the original question 𝑄 and the data 𝐷 obtained from prior operations, and uses an LLM to generate the final answer. In cases where the question is decomposed into multiple sub-questions, semantic reasoning can also be used to aggregate intermediate answers into final response."

            "content": "Figure 5 illustrates the overall process of question decomposition, operation generation, and step-by-step data retrieval via both topdown and bottom-up strategies. Step 1: Question Decomposition. As shown in Figure 5, upon receiving user question, we first utilize the semantic understanding capabilities of an LLM to decompose complex multi-hop questions into multiple simpler, single-step sub-questions. Specifically, we prompt the LLM with the input question, sampled table content as semantic supplements, and example decomposition cases that are dynamically retrieved based on question similarity to generate sub-questions. These sub-questions are often interdependent: some can be directly resolved using the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒, while others rely on intermediate results produced by earlier sub-questions. For example, question such as What is the total salary for 2021 and 2022? 8 can be decomposed into three sub-questions: (1) retrieve the 2021 salary, (2) retrieve the 2022 salary, and (3) compute the sum of the two. For table operation generation, we prompt the LLMs with predefined set of operations and illustrative examples. Step 2: Relevant Data Retrieval. Each sub-question is then answered independently through combination of top-down and bottom-up retrieval. ST-Raptor always starts with top-down retrieval and switches to bottom-up retrieval when the former fails. The left section of Figure 5 shows this iterative process. For each sub-question, the LLM first generates an operation statement based on the sub-question content and the meta-information extracted from the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑒. Executing this operation yields intermediate results (i.e., sub-trees), which are then used to inform subsequent operation generation. We employ the Align operation for two purposes: (1) OperationTable Alignment, applied upon each operations generation to align sub-questions with the corresponding table content, and (2) Relevant Content Match, invoked when the number of data nodes is large, to extract key entities from the question and constrain the search space within the HO-Tree. Step 3: Answer Generation Once the relevant sub-data is retrieved, each sub-question is resolved via the Reason operation, and all sub-answers are aggregated to produce the final answer."

            "content": "when asking for company information and the given data only contain employee information, we stop the process). This involves directly matching generated parameters against table cells to ensure semantic and syntactic alignment. After executing each operation over the HO-Tree, the general LLM evaluates whether the resulting data sufficiently answers the corresponding sub-question. If the result is found to be inadequate, new operation statement is generated to continue the reasoning process. Notably, real-world queries often lack sufficient information to be answered directly from the table, which may cause the model to hallucinate incorrect answers. To mitigate this issue, the forward verification mechanism allows the model to halt the pipeline and return an unanswerable signal when it detects that the answer cannot be reliably inferred. Furthermore, when operation statements are found to misalign with the table content, the system triggers regeneration process to refine and correct the statements, thereby improving both the data retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Backward Verification. In the second stage, we evaluate the correctness of the generated operation pipeline by verifying it against alternative reasoning paths. Notably, different questions over the same semi-structured table may yield identical answers via distinct yet similar pipelines (e.g., Who is the highest-paid employee? vs. Who leads the technical department?). Leveraging this property, we perform backward verification by generating alternative questions with the same answer, deriving corresponding pipelines, and measuring their similarity to the original. The average similarity serves as an implicit indicator of pipeline and answer reliability. Specifically, we employ few-shot learning, retrieving questionsimilar examples to guide the generation of alternative questions to solve the problem that questions with the same answers may show tremendous difference in their operation pipeline."

It iteratively generates operations, updates the table, and constructs reasoning chain as proxy for Figure 6: Characteristic-based Grouping Mechanism to reduce complexity in tables with numerous similar cells. With clearly defined rules, it achieves near-perfect accuracy. Each category is then grouped using tailored strategies: (1) Discrete values are clustered by exact matches (e.g., students with Grade A); (2) Continuous values are sorted and partitioned into fixed intervals to preserve numeric order (e.g., stress levels by range); and (3) Unstructured values are grouped via embeddingbased clustering to capture semantic similarity. As shown in Figure 6, column with values like Grade (A+, A, A-, ...) is classified as Discrete, allowing identical values to be grouped. Queries such as fetch all students with Grade can then be resolved efficiently within the corresponding group. 2. Group-based Data Retrieval. The parallel-direction grouping leverages structural relationships within the 𝐻𝑂-𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑒. After locating the target node(s) based on content, the tree is traversed to retrieve related information by: (1) searching upwards for ancestor nodes and (2) searching downwards for descendant nodes. This bi-directional traversal allows for the reconstruction of minimal sub-tree that contextualizes the target node, revealing the complete information associated with the same entity (e.g., retrieving all attributes of specific student or transaction)."

First, we augment the question set by extracting information from tables as answers, then generating corresponding questions to enhance QA pair alignment. Second, we sample question templates and prompt LLM to generate open-ended questionanswer pairs based on the table and template. To ensure data quality, we implement two-step verification process. Initially, LLM validates the alignment between tables, queries, and answers. This is followed by manual inspection to verify answer correctness by 11 professional annotators, which results in high-quality dataset of 764 meticulously curated table-based QA pairs. Table Complexity. We categorize table difficulty based on weighted combination of three key features: (i) nesting depth (0.5), (ii) structural irregularity, including the number of header rows and column spans (0.3), and (iii) average cell content length (0.2). After z-score normalization and feature aggregation, SSTQA tables are grouped into 59 simple, 33 medium, and 10 hard instances. Table + QA Complexity. Table-question difficulty varies with the combination of table structure and query complexity. Accordingly, we categorize Table+QA tasks into three levels: (i) simple, where answers can be directly retrieved from the table; (ii) medium, requiring logical inference or conditional operations; and (iii) hard, where answers are not explicitly present and demand semantic reasoning. We obtain 299 simple, 284 medium, and 178 hard cases. The corresponding experimental results are presented in section 7.3. Evaluation Metrics. We adopt two primary evaluation metrics: Answer Accuracy (Acc), following prior work [23, 44], and ROUGEL to accommodate summarization-style questions in SSTQA.

NL2SQL-based approaches perform the worst on the SSTQA and TempTabQA dataset but achieve better results on WikiTQ, as the SQL generation paradigm is ill-suited for non-relational data, making it ineffective for semistructured tables. TableLLM ranks second-lowest on SSTQA due to two main limitations: (1) its training is restricted to structured datasets, reducing its generalizability to semi-structured formats, and (2) it struggles with large-scale tables and complex layouts due to limited context length and one-dimensional semantic reasoning. Its improved performance on WikiTQ can be attributed to task-specific fine-tuning on this dataset. Agent-based methods perform better on SSTQA due to their integration of external tools, but they fail to operate directly on semi-structured tables. The transformation of semi-structured data into structured formats results in the loss of critical layout information, reducing their effectiveness. TAT-LLM exhibits unexpectedly strong performance on the TempTabQA dataset. We attribute this to its fine-tuning on large volume of financial data, which shares similarities with the temporal question types prevalent in TempTabQA, thereby contributing to its effectiveness. Vision-language models excel at layout recognition through visual encoding but underperform in text-dense scenarios due to limited textual comprehension, especially in tables requiring strong semantic understanding. Foundation models, while not explicitly designed for table-related tasks, achieve the second-best performance on SSTQA dataset. This is attributed to their robust contextual reasoning and semantic interpretation abilities, enabling accurate answer inference especially when tabular layout understanding is secondary to interpreting textual content. Accuracy under Different Table Difficulties. We categorize tables in SSTQA benchmark into three levels of difficulty (i.e., Simple, Medium, Hard) by layout complexity and content length. Figure 7 presents the comparative performance evaluation across these difficulty levels. Three key observations emerge from our analysis. First, both ST-Raptor and foundation models exhibit progressively decreasing performance as table difficulty increases, underscoring the inherent challenges posed by complex layouts and largescale semi-structured tables. In contrast, other methods demonstrate only marginal performance variation across difficulty levels. We posit that these models primarily address questions with less table structure comprehension. Consequently, performance differences among them are largely driven by architectural variations rather than structural modeling capabilities. Second, although ST-Raptor shows modest performance decline on hard-level tables, it consistently outperforms all methods by substantial margin (e.g., exceeding the second-best model by over 20% on the SSTQA dataset). The reasons are three-fold: (1) the hierarchical HO-Tree representation, which facilitates efficient processing of large tables; (2) the question decomposition mechanism, which simplifies complex queries into tractable sub-questions; and (3) the operation-table alignment strategy, which ensures accurate and context-aware data retrieval. Third, performance differences across models are less pronounced. This can be attributed to three key factors: (1) the smaller table sizes, which reduce structural complexity; (2) the predominance of semantically driven questions that require less explicit layout Figure 7: Evaluation Results under Different Table Difficulty. Overall Accuracy. Experiments show that ST-Raptor consistently outperforms all nine baselines across the evaluated WikiTQST, TempTabQA-ST and SSTQA benchmarks. Table 5 shows ST-Raptor achieves the highest accuracy, exceeding the second-best method by 10.23% on SSTQA benchmark. This consistent outperformance can be attributed to three folds. First, ST-Raptor leverages the HO-Tree to represent semi-structured tables, enabling explicit structural modeling while decoupling layout understanding from question answering. This design allows the general-purpose LLM to operate without directly parsing complex table layouts. Instead, given JSON-formatted header information, ST-Raptor generates atomic operations and executes them on the HO-Tree for relevant data retrieval. In contrast, most methods, excluding vision-language models (VLMs) which can directly perceive layout information from table images, struggle to capture two-dimensional semantics using linear text representations. Second, ST-Raptor incorporates novel question decomposition mechanism that breaks complex queries into simpler sub-questions, followed by precise operation-table alignment. This improves both operation generation accuracy and execution reliability, thereby improving overall question answering performance. Third, ST-Raptor dynamically combines top-down and bottomup retrieval strategies based on question characteristics, enabling robust handling of diverse semi-structured table QA scenarios. When the top-down retrieval fails or question lacks explicit header references, bottom-up retrieval is employed. This flexible approach allows the system to effectively navigate complex table structures, outperforming other methods in challenging scenarios. Additionally, we observe performance increase (around 3%) even on the simple tables of WikiTQ-ST and TempTabQA-ST. For WikiTQ, where the majority of tables are fully structured, ST-Raptor outperforms the second-best model by around 2%. This modest improvement reflects ST-Raptors specialization for semi-structured tables with complex nested hierarchies. In contrast, on TempTabQA, where all tables are semi-structured but exhibit only shallow nesting and small sizes, ST-Raptor achieves around 3% improvement over the second-best approach. While our model could effectively models such structures, the overall retrieval pipeline remains relatively simple, limiting the performance gap over LLMs like Deepseek-V3 which can directly interpreting relevant information.

Analysis on Table + QA Difficulty. We categorize the Table+QA tasks into three difficulty levels. As shown in Table 6, ST-Raptor outperforms all baselines across these levels. While both foundation models and ST-Raptor perform well on simple cases, accuracy drops as difficulty increases. Notably, ST-Raptor demonstrates superior performance on hard cases, attributed to its HO-Tree-based representation and operation-pipeline-driven QA strategy. We categorize Table+QA tasks into three difficulty levels  (Table 6)  . ST-Raptor consistently outperforms all baselines across these levels.

Experimental results show false negative rate of 4.78% under the few-shot learning setting, indicating that misjudgments in backward verification have minimal impact on table QA performance. Latency Analysis. The runtime of ST-Raptor is primarily influenced by the cost of accessing the LLM, largely due to network latency. As ST-Raptor performs question answering via pipelinebased operation generation, the runtime per query is inherently unstable. ST-Raptor requires around 30 seconds per question (ignoring bias caused by factors like network communications), with 2.89 pipeline operations on average. This is substantially faster than the agent-based method, which incurs higher latency due to greater number of operations with more API calls, and slightly slower than the fine-tuning approach, which benefits from local deployment and direct reasoning. Effects of Pipeline Mistakes. Pipeline Mistakes Analysis. Mistakes in the ST-Raptor pipeline primarily arise from two sources. First, mistakes in meta-information detection by the VLM can lead to incorrect HO-Tree representations, resulting in more complex data retrieval paths (e.g., locating related data dispersed across different subtrees) and reduced overall efficiency (e.g., from 10 to"

To ensure both execution\ncorrectness and answer reliability, we proposed a two-stage verifica-\ntion mechanism combining forward constraint checking and back-\nward answer validation.
