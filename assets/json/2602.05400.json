            "content": "Large language model (LLM) pre-training has entered critical phase, transitioning from an era of unconstrained data scaling to regime where the efficiency and quality of every training token are paramount. For the past decade, progress in language modeling has been driven by scaling two primary factors: model size and data volume (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024a;b; 2025; Guo et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024a; Anthropic, 2024). Scaling laws emphasize that performance is tightly coupled with the efficiency of converting compute into effective training signals (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Yet the data factor is now saturating: projections suggest that readily available high-quality public text may be exhausted by 20262028 (Villalobos et al., 2022). In this data-wall regime, pre-training must shift from problem of ingestion capacity to one of control: which tokens should shape the model at this specific optimizer step? When every update consumes scarce tokens, data selection is no longer pure preprocessing choice but an integral component of the optimization process. Existing approaches to this problem present distinct limitations. Static curation methods, such as FineWeb-Edu classifiers (Penedo et al., 2024) and the DCLM quality classifier (Li et al., 2024), rely on fixed, training-agnostic heuristics that assume samples utility remains constant as the model evolves. In contrast, prior dynamic selection methods (Wang et al., 2024; 2025a;b) score candidates in raw gradient space, implicitly assuming Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) dynamics. This induces fundamental misalignment with modern LLM training, which relies on adaptive optimizers such as AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) and Muon (Jordan et al., 2024) that precondition and reshape the effective update direction. As shown in Figure 2, existing approaches depart from the optimizers actual update geometry, causing unsatisfied optimization trajectory. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), framework designed to make data selection in pre-training both principled and scalable. OPUS achieves principled objective by adapting during training to the models evolving needs, unlike static filters, and by defining utility in the optimizer-induced update space. The core insight is that batch is valuable only insofar as it moves parameters in direction that improves the models performance on high-quality target distribution, referred to as the proxy, under the optimizers specific geometry. OPUS scores each candidate by projecting its optimizer-induced effective update onto the descent direction of this proxy set, eliminating the discrepancy between scoring and training that arises when Adam or Muon training is treated as if it were SGD. To ensure scalability, OPUS estimates these utilities via lightweight projections, avoiding the prohibitive cost of materializing full gradients. OPUS operationalizes this principle through an objective, an estimator, and selection rule. First, we formalize utility as the expected one-step improvement on held-out proxy distribution, measured in the optimizer-induced update geometry, so that scoring aligns with the trajectory induced by AdamW or Muon. Second, we make this objective practical 2 Preprint. Under review. Figure 3: Overview of OPUS pipeline. at LLM scale by (i) constructing stable, in-distribution target direction for the proxy signal and (ii) estimating the required inner products efficiently without materializing persample gradients. Third, we use Boltzmann sampling to preserve data diversity. Figure 3 summarizes the end-to-end workflow. Our contributions are as follows: principled, optimizer-aware utility for dynamic selection: We introduce optimizerinduced utility as theoretically grounded objective for dynamic data selection. By deriving closed-form approximations for the effective update directions of AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) and Muon (Jordan et al., 2024), OPUS scores data in the actual optimizerinduced geometry, yielding modeland optimizer-aware alternative to heuristic filters. Stable in-distribution proxy construction: We propose BENCH-PROXY, procedure for constructing proxy pool by retrieving benchmark-aligned samples directly from the pre-training corpus. This yields reliable, in-distribution proxy direction that stabilizes utility estimation compared to using raw benchmark validation data. Scalable utility estimation via ghost and CountSketch: To make scoring efficient at LLM scale, we avoid per-sample gradient materialization by combining the ghost technique (Wang et al., 2024) with CountSketch projections (Cormode & Muthukrishnan, 2005), reducing inner products to computations in low-dimensional space. Boltzmann sampling to prevent diversity collapse: To avoid biased or redundant selection induced by greedy top-k under non-stationary streams, OPUS uses Boltzmann soft sampling with an in-step redundancy penalty. OPUS achieves strong empirical gains over industrial baselines: Across from-scratch pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu (Penedo et al., 2024) and continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base (Yang et al., 2025) on SciencePedia (SciencePedia Team, 2025), OPUS outperforms prior industrial static filters and dynamic selectors with better efficiency."

            "content": "Static pre-training data selection. Most large-scale LLM pre-training pipelines rely on static corpus filtering, where documents are filtered or reweighted once before training. Representative approaches include classifieror rule-based filtering over web corpora, exemplified by FineWeb and its educational subset FineWeb-Edu (Penedo et al., 2024), which document large-scale deduplication and quality filtering choices for Common Crawl derived data. Recent work has also studied more targeted quality signals: QuRating (Wettig et al., 2024) learns scalar quality ratings from pairwise preferences and shows that balancing quality and diversity improves downstream performance, while DSIR (Xie et al., 2023) formalizes dataset matching via importance resampling in reduced feature space, enabling scalable selection without human curation. Complementary benchmark and pipeline efforts such as DataComp-LM (DCLM) (Li et al., 2024) provide standardized corpora and evaluation suites to compare filtering strategies, and UltraFineweb (Wang et al., 2025c) proposes efficient filter3 Preprint. Under review. ing and verification mechanisms (including lightweight classifier-based pipelines) to further improve web-scale data quality. While effective at removing low-quality noise, these static approaches are inherently training-agnostic: they assume sample utility is time-invariant and do not adapt to the models evolving needs across optimization. Dynamic data selection during pre-training. To move beyond fixed corpora, dynamic selection chooses samples on-the-fly based on an estimated training utility. Early and widelyused heuristics prioritize samples with large loss or high perplexity, and several works formalize this intuition via online batch selection and importance sampling (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016; Katharopoulos & Fleuret, 2019). more rigorous approach uses influence functions (IF) to estimate the impact of training points on validation loss (Koh & Liang, 2017). While classic IF methods are computationally intensive and require Hessian inversion, recent approximations have made them more feasible for deep learning. In LLM pre-training, GREATS proposes principled objective by approximating per-sample validation loss reduction via Taylor expansion, and then selects subset each step, typically greedily. It can incur substantial scoring overhead due to per-sample gradient and influence approximations (Wang et al., 2024). More recently, MATES (Yu et al., 2024b) learns lightweight influence model to track evolving data preferences during pre-training, and Group-MATES (Yu et al., 2025) emphasizes that utility is not additive and that group-level interactions matter, mitigating redundancy induced by greedy top-k selection. In parallel, perplexity-based pruning remains competitive, simple signal for data selection and pruning, including settings where small reference model computes PPL to prune large-scale corpora (Ankner et al., 2025). OPUS fits this dynamic-selection family, but differs by aligning utility with the optimizer-induced update and by using efficient projected scoring with soft sampling. Influence-function scores and data-attribution. large line of work studies training-data influence and attribution (Hammoudeh & Lowd, 2024; Deng et al., 2025)estimating how individual samples affect model behavior or validation loss. Classical influence functions approximate the effect of upweighting training point via Hessian-based sensitivity analysis, enabling fine-grained data attribution without retraining (Koh & Liang, 2017). To make influence estimation practical in deep, non-convex settings, some works replace exact second-order IF computation with scalable surrogates (Pruthi et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Yeh et al., 2018). Related directions also develop first-order or early-training proxies for data importance, such as selecting informative subsets early in training (Paul et al., 2021), leveraging forgetting events to identify noisy or hard-to-learn samples (Toneva et al., 2019), and optimizing subset selection via gradient-matching (Killamsetty et al., 2021) or influence functions (Hu et al., 2024). Another line of research explores Shapley value, concept from cooperative game theory, to quantify the value of data (Ghorbani & Zou, 2019; Jia et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2025a). Recently, influence and data-attribution signals have been adapted from classical IF literature to practical data selection for large language models, including LoRAaware influence approximations and gradient-datastore based retrieval (Xia et al., 2024), as well as more structured selection pipelines that optimize selection objectives for instruction tuning (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b). Moreover, many approaches implicitly operate in raw-gradient geometry and/or employ deterministic top-k retrieval, which can become brittle under rapidly changing training dynamics and optimizer-induced transformations. These limitations motivate online selection objectives that remain faithful to the effective optimizer update while preserving scalability and diversity."

Dynamic methods select data during training at each step t, adapting to the current model parameter θt and optimizer state. At step t, the algorithm receives candidate buffer Bt = {z1, . . . , zN} of sequences from the update stream Dtr.

(1) Here, Pt encapsulates the optimizer state at step and induces the geometry that the training trajectory actually follows. When the optimizers transformation is not strictly linear, Pt should be read as state-dependent operator acting on the gradient.

With optional weight decay, the one-step update becomes θt = ηt (cid:0)gt + λθt (cid:1). For online scoring at fixed step t, SGD induces an identity update geometry Pt I, so utility is naturally measured in raw-gradient space. In practice, Muon forms double-smoothed direction fed to the orthogonalizer, qt+1,L(S) := (1 µ)gt,L(S) + µmt+1,L(S) = µ2mt,L(S) + (1 µ2)gt,L(S). and takes the parameter step Wt,L(S) := Wt+1,L(S) Wt,L = ηtOt,L (cid:0)qt+1,L(S)(cid:1). (3) (4) Online-selection view. For scoring at fixed step t, we hold Muons state fixed (learning rate ηt, momentum coefficient µ, and the history buffer mt,L). Moreover, we freeze the NewtonSchulz (NS) operator during selection by constructing it from reference direction qt,L available at the start of step (e.g., from the current optimizer buffer / proxy batch), and reuse it for all candidates.

Unlike vanilla SGD, modern LLM training relies on adaptive optimizers that reshape gradients through state-dependent preconditioner. We denote the optimizer state operator at step as Pt and define the optimizer-induced effective update direction as: (19) Accordingly, the optimizer update induced by subset can be written as θt(S) = (t) ηt zS . In particular, adding single candidate contributes an additional update (t) θt({z}) = ηt . Substituting θt({z}) into the marginal approximation in Eq. (18) gives := PtθL(z; θt).

The marginal gain of adding candidate (t) to the current subset (cid:98)Bt, denoted as , depends on the validation gradient evaluated at the virtual parameters θt( (cid:98)Bt). Specifically, the first-order approximation of the utility is given by the inner product between the optimizer-induced update and the gradient at the virtual point: (t) ηt (cid:68) (cid:69) (t) , θL(Dval; θt( (cid:98)Bt)) 9 . (21) Preprint. Under review. Computing this virtual gradient exactly would require an additional backward pass on Dval after every selection step, which is prohibitively expensive. To avoid this cost, we linearize the gradient function gval(θ) := θL(Dval; θ) around the current parameters θt. Let θt( (cid:98)Bt) := θt( (cid:98)Bt) θt be the accumulated update from the currently selected subset. first-order Taylor expansion gives: (cid:16) θL Dval; θt( (cid:98)Bt) (cid:17) gval(θt) + θgval(θt) θt( (cid:98)Bt) = (t) val + (t) val θt( (cid:98)Bt), (t) val is the validation gradient at θt and (t) where val is the Hessian. Using the update rule, the (t) accumulated update is θt( (cid:98)Bt) = ηt zj . Substituting the gradient approximation (Eq. (22)) and the explicit update form into Eq. (21), we obtain the final tractable scoring function: zj (cid:98)Bt (cid:42) (t) ηt (t) , u (t) val ηtH (t) val zj (cid:98)Bt (t) zj (cid:43) = ηt (cid:124) (cid:68) (t) val (t) , (cid:123)(cid:122) Alignment (cid:69) (cid:125) η2 (cid:68) (t) , u (cid:69) .

Following (Wang et al., 2024), we adopt an isotropic approximation for this interaction term, (t) Hval I. Defining the accumulated effective direction G(t) := zj , we obtain the practical redundancy-adjusted score: (cid:68) zj (cid:98)Bt (cid:69) (cid:68) (t) ηt (t) , u (t) val η2 (t) , G(t)(cid:69) . (22) (t) Stable proxy construction via BENCH-PROXY. The quality of the proxy direction val is critical for principled selection. While random hold-out set provides low-variance signal, it often fails to capture the specific distribution of downstream tasks. Conversely, using raw benchmark samples directly as the proxy introduces severe distribution shift and gradient noise, destabilizing the ranking. To bridge this gap, we introduce BENCH-PROXY, retrieval-based construction shown in Fig. 3(a). We embed both (i) the target benchmark validation set and (ii) candidate documents from the pre-training corpus using frozen text encoder, and retrieve the top-M most similar pre-training documents to form an indistribution proxy pool Dproxy. This approach yields proxy that is aligned with the target tasks yet remains within the pre-training manifold, ensuring valid gradient estimation. Concretely, at step we draw proxy mini-batch { zk}Kproxy Dproxy and estimate the k=1 Kproxy θL( zk; θt). Substituting this proxy estimate into Eq. (22), direction via k=1 we obtain the final scoring rule: (t) proxy = 1 (t) ηt (cid:68) (t) , (t) proxy (cid:69) η2 (cid:68) (t) , G(t)(cid:69) . (23) This formulation ensures that selected updates not only reduce loss but specifically align with the benchmark-relevant subspace of the optimization landscape. Further details of BENCH-PROXY construction are provided in Sec 6.2."

In OPUS, we apply it over set of layers (e.g., linear and embedding matrices).

These quantities contain all information required to compute the projected scores, and are discarded layer-by-layer to maintain low memory overhead. (z) (z) , (t) CountSketch projection. Computing the utility in Eq. (23) requires applying the optiz mizer preconditioner Pt. We project the resulting effective updates into low-dimensional sketch space using sparse CountSketch map Π : Rd Rm (m d).

Pt,r (24) We instantiate Πr using CountSketch (Cormode & Muthukrishnan, 2005), which enables computing the projection by streaming over the coordinates of the outer-product gradient without explicitly materializing it. This choice yields concrete computational benefits depending on the structure of Pt,r. For AdamW, Pt,r is diagonal (Section 4), preserving the coordinate-wise separable structure of the outer-product gradient. This allows the CountSketch projection to be interleaved with preconditioning by applying the diagonal weights on the fly, yielding projection cost of O(din + dout) rather than the O(dindout) cost required for dense projection. In contrast, for optimizers with dense preconditioners such as Muon, coordinate mixing destroys this separability, resulting in projection cost of O(dindout). We approximate the alignment and redundancy terms by summing dot products in the sketch space across layers: ηt (t) rR ϕ(t,r)(z), ψ (t,r) proxy η2 rR ϕ(t,r)(z), Φ(t,r), (25) where Φ(t,r) = (cid:16) 1 (t,r) proxy := Πr ψ gradient direction."

GPT-2 Large consists of 36 layers with hidden size of 1280, totaling approximately 774M parameters, while GPT-2 XL features deeper architecture of 48 layers and hidden size of 1600, amounting to 1.5B parameters. Unless stated otherwise, all methods are compute-matched by performing parameter updates on exactly 30B update tokens. For GPT-2 models, we keep most modules in FP32 but cast the token embedding layers to BF16 for efficiency. We also evaluate OPUS in continued pre-training setting using the Qwen3-8B-Base (Yang et al., 2025). This model architecture comprises 36 layers with hidden size of 4096 and approximately 8B parameters. In this configuration, the model is adapted on science-domain stream, keep the training recipe fixed, and vary only the selection policy. We train with mixed precision in bfloat16. For Qwen3-8B-Base models, we cast the entire model to BF16 to maintain dtype consistency. All experiments run with synchronous data-parallel training using NCCL.

For GPT-2 we set Ltrain=24,576 (GPT-2 Large) and Ltrain=6,144 (GPT-2 XL), with Lval=32,768 (Large) and Lval=8,192 (XL).1 For OPUS, at each optimization step we score candidates using only Lscore=512 tokens of each sequence. We form candidate buffer of N=32 sequences for GPT-2 runs. For Qwen3-8B, we use M=16 as buffer-size multiplier; selection is performed globally by gathering scores across all GPUs and selecting the top K=ρN sequences with ρ=0.5. We use the validation split as the proxy set for scoring (proxy batch size 8) and refresh it every step. After selection, the model performs full forward/backward update on the selected sequences of length Ltrain, and the token budget is counted using Ltrain. The additional forward computation used for scoring is treated as overhead (Sec. 6.6). Random projection is disabled in these runs unless stated otherwise. Optimizers and hyperparameters.

In AdamW setting, we use AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) for all parameters as unified baseline. Optimizer assignment. For clarity and reproducibility, we explicitly specify how parameters are assigned to optimizers in our experimental settings  (Table 1)  . In the Muon setting, we apply Muon updates only to matrix-shaped parameters inside Transformer blocks, i.e., parameters under model.blocks with ndim 2 (e.g., attention and MLP projection matrices). All remaining parametersincluding token embeddings, the LM head, and all 0/1D parameters such as RMSNorm weights and biasesare optimized with distributed AdamW optimizer. This hybrid design follows the recommended usage of Muon, which is intended for 2D matrices and is not directly applicable to 0/1D parameter types. In the AdamW setting, we instead optimize all parameters with AdamW optimizer. 1For the Qwen3-8B CPT runs, we use Ltrain=4,096 and Lval=4,096 with FlexAttention. 2The optimizer employed in our implementation combines Muon and AdamW.

Specifically, we run NewtonSchulz quintic iteration for 5 steps in BF16 to produce an approximate zeroth-power transform, serving as an efficient surrogate to the UV factor in SVD-based orthogonalization.

We train Qwen3-8B for token budget of 1.5B tokens and evaluate every 0.5B tokens. The learning-rate schedule is implemented as piecewise multiplier over the base LR with warmup fraction of 0.01. Random projection configuration. To accelerate OPUS scoring, we apply CountSketchbased random projection to per-sample gradients, implementing the sketching operator. Concretely, for each trainable linear weight we form the per-sample gradient in outerproduct form (aggregated over time when applicable) and then sketch the flattened gradient into an m-dimensional vector using CountSketch with deterministic hash/sign pair; this yields an unbiased estimator of inner products, EΠ(g1), Π(g2) = g1, g2, enabling us to compute gradient dot-products (and similarity matrices) in the projected space. We set the sketch dimension to = 8192 with seed 42, which provides substantial compression for GPT-2 XL where the largest matrix-gradient has dimension on the order of 10.24M, corresponding to an effective compression of roughly 1250 while preserving the ranking signal used by OPUS. The projection is enabled during scoring and uses cached hash/sign tensors per parameter shape for efficiency; when disabled, we fall back to exact full-dimensional dot-products. Pre-training corpus. For from-scratch pre-training, all methods draw candidates from the same 3T-token pool constructed from FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024). To test robustness on higher-quality corpus, we also run the same recipe on FineWeb-Edu (Penedo et al., 2024). FineWeb-Edu provides document-level quality classifier that assigns each document discrete score in {3,4,5}. We partition the FineWeb-Edu pool into two buckets: 120B-token mid-quality bucket consisting of all score-3 documents, and 80B-token high-quality bucket formed by merging score-4 and score-5 documents. For static filtering baselines, we score the full pool once and materialize fixed 30B-token subset for training. For dynamic methods, candidates are streamed from the pool and selected during training. For CPT, we construct 3B-token pool from SciencePedia (SciencePedia Team, 2025) for continued pre-training. Evaluation. We evaluate all GPT-2 pretraining checkpoints on variety of benchmarks target diverse capabilities. See Table 2 for the summary of the configurations. 14 Preprint. Under review. Specifically, we evaluate on the following benchmarks to test the general capabilities of our pretrained models: MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021): broad factual and academic knowledge across many subjects. ANLI (Nie et al., 2020): adversarial natural language inference, testing robust entailment and contradiction reasoning. HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019): commonsense reasoning for plausible continuations. PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020): physical commonsense reasoning about everyday actions. SIQA (Sap et al., 2019): social commonsense and intent reasoning. WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020): pronoun/coreference resolution with adversarial bias reduction.

CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019): commonsense knowledge and reasoning over concepts. WSC (Levesque et al., 2012): hard coreference requiring commonsense. For all above benchmarks except for MMLU, we use OpenCompass (Contributors, 2023) with multiple-choice perplexity scoring rule: for each candidate answer option, we compute its average negative log-likelihood conditioned on the prompt, and predict the option with the lowest perplexity; we then report accuracy. For WinoGrande, we follow the OpenCompass log-likelihood variant that compares the likelihood of the two candidates. All these benchmarks are evaluated zero-shot. MMLU is evaluated separately with Lighteval (Habib et al., 2023) following the implementation in FineWeb-Edu (Penedo et al., 2024) evaluation protocol. Since the typical MMLU implementation (which uses A, B, etc as answer targets) gives generally random results on non instruction tuned models, instead, we use the full MMLU answer as the target. We also use zero-shot prompting and then select the answer by comparing the log-likelihood of the entire option string. In addition, we use the following benchmarks that are not in our bench-proxy set for the generalization evaluation: BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023): challenging subset of BIG-Bench tasks emphasizing multistep reasoning. We select set of BBH tasks where base models produce non-degenerate outputs: Tracking Shuffled Objects, Reasoning about Colored Objects, Logical Deduction, Disambiguation QA, Penguins in Table, and Sports Understanding. RACE-M / RACE-H (Lai et al., 2017): exam-style reading comprehension with multiple choice questions; we use the Middle and High school subsets. AX-B / AX-G (Wang et al., 2019): diagnostic evaluation sets from SuperGLUE designed to stress-test linguistic phenomena and generalization. StoryCloze (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016): story ending prediction to test narrative coherence and commonsense continuation. We evaluate these benchmarks using the OpenCompass framework. All these benchmarks are evaluated zero-shot except for BBH, which uses three-shot. For BBH, many subtasks are near-chance at our model scale, so an aggregate score over all subtasks becomes unstable and less informative. We therefore report results on the curated subset above, where the base model achieves non-trivial accuracy and methods exhibit meaningful separation. CPT evaluation. We evaluate continued pre-training checkpoints of Qwen3-8B-Base on two science focused benchmarks, OlympicArena (Huang et al., 2024) and SciAssess (Cai et al., 2024). For OlympicArena, we evaluate on the test split and use zero-shot prompting. For SciAssess, we evaluate four subdomains in biology, chemistry, material, medicine using 3-shot prompting setting with chain-of-thought enabled where available. We use stochastic decoding with temperature 0.6, top-p = 0.95, and top-k = 20, and max sequence length of 1024. We report the official accuracy metric for both benchmarks. 15 Preprint. Under review. Baselines. We compare OPUS against representative data selection methods. (1) Static baselines. We evaluate five representative static filtering methods: QuRating (Wettig et al., 2024), DSIR (Xie et al., 2023), DCLM-FastText (Li et al., 2024), FineWeb-Edu Classifier (Penedo et al., 2024), and UltraFineweb Classifier (Wang et al., 2025c).

The goal is to build small proxy set Dproxy that matches the target benchmarks distribution, while being sampled from the pre-training corpus so gradients can be computed efficiently and consistently during pre-training. Similarity scoring. We first assign each pre-training document benchmark relevance score based on its semantic similarity to the benchmark validation set Dval. Concretely, we use frozen sentence embedding model Arctic-Embed-L v2 (Yu et al., 2024a) to encode (i) each benchmark sample and (ii) each pre-training document into shared embedding space, and compute cosine similarities between document embeddings and benchmark embeddings. To obtain single scalar score per document, we reduce the similarity vector by taking the maximum similarity over all benchmark samples, which captures whether document is strongly aligned with any benchmark instance. This produces scored version of the pre-training corpus, where each document is annotated with benchmark alignment score. Proxy construction. We then construct the proxy pool Dproxy by selecting the highest-scoring documents from the scored corpus. In practice, we sort documents by their benchmark relevance scores in descending order and greedily accumulate them until reaching fixed token budget (30M tokens in our experiments), which yields compact but benchmarkaligned proxy shard. During training, we repeatedly sample mini-batches from Dproxy to estimate the proxy gradient direction used for within-step ranking. This design keeps scoring stable and low-variance, while steering selection toward data that matches the target benchmark distribution."

We also include longer-training random-sampling reference at 60B update tokens to contextualize the magnitude of these efficiency gains; notably, OPUS often matches or exceeds the performance of baselines trained for twice as long. Robustness on curated corpora: FineWeb-Edu. We next evaluate performance on FineWebEdu. To test the limits of our method, we subject OPUS to strict evaluation regime: it selects dynamically from the lower-quality subset (FineWeb-Edu score 3), whereas baselines are trained on the superior high-quality partition (scores 4 and 5). As shown in Table 4, despite this disadvantage in raw data quality, OPUS matches or exceeds prior methods trained on the superior data. For GPT-2 XL with Muon, OPUS achieves the best compute-matched average of 44.99, outperforming all baselines trained on the higher-quality data partitions. Optimizer-induced selection matters: strong gains under AdamW and Muon. Under AdamW, which utilizes diagonal preconditioning, OPUS achieves the best compute-matched performance for both GPT-2 Large and GPT-2 XL  (Table 3)  . Crucially, this advantage extends to Muon, which employs non-linear matrix preconditioning via Newton-Schulz orthogonalization. For instance, on GPT-2 XL with Muon optimizer on FineWeb, OPUS outperforms Random selection by significant margin (40.29 41.75). This empirically 16 Preprint. Under review.

Generalization beyond proxy-aligned benchmarks. Since OPUS uses benchmarkmatched proxy direction to guide training-time selection, it is important to verify that gains are not merely driven by overfitting to the specific evaluation suite used to construct the proxy. We therefore evaluate on set of out-of-distribution benchmarks covering challenging reasoning and general language comprehension for generalization evaluation. As shown in Table 5, OPUS achieves the best performance, suggesting that it reflects more general training signal quality, rather than narrow specialization to the proxy-aligned benchmark.

We report validation-loss trajectories in Figure 4 for GPT-2 XL and GPT-2 Large trained from scratch on FineWeb-Edu under the same training recipe and fixed budget of 30B update tokens.

For GPT-2 XL, OPUS reaches the validation loss achieved by Random trained for 60B update tokens using only 17B update tokens, demonstrating substantially faster convergence. For GPT-2 Large, OPUS exhibits the same trend and maintains clear gap over baselines throughout training. OPUS enhances knowledge compression measured by domain perplexity across domains. To ensure that our selection strategy does not overfit to specific patterns at the expense of broad coverage, we evaluate domain-wise perplexity (PPL). Following the evaluation protocol of WEBORGANIZER (Wettig et al., 2025), we first label documents using the WebOrganizer topic classifier to classify documents into 24 topics and merge these semantically similar topics into ten domains. We then construct held-out test set by randomly sampling 1,000 documents from each of ten distinct domains (e.g., Health, Law, Science) to ensure balanced evaluation. Table 6 indicates that OPUS achieves the lowest average perplexity on FineWeb-Edu dataset. 18 Preprint. Under review.

Benchmark-matched proxy vs. standard proxy. OPUS estimates the target update direction using small proxy pool. We compare the default proxy construction with benchmarkmatched proxy that is retrieved to better reflect the downstream evaluation distribution (Sec. 5). As shown in Table 7, the benchmark-matched proxy yields measurable improvement over the default setting, increasing the average from 41.03 to 41.75. This indicates that sharpening the proxy direction can further increase the effectiveness of utility-based selection. Table 7 also shows that the standard proxy already provides strong gains over RANDOM, improving the average from 40.29 to 41.03.

We conduct further ablation studies on key hyperparameters of OPUS, including (i) the candidate buffer size bt, (ii) the Boltzmann sampling temperature τ, and (iii) the CountSketch projection dimension  (Table 8)  . Overall, OPUS is reasonably stable across the tested settings and improves over random selection in most configurations. Increasing the buffer size tends to help, with bt=64 yielding the best average performance among the evaluated choices. For stochastic selection, moderate temperature offers better explorationexploitation trade-off: τ=0.9 performs best compared to both lower temperature (more greedy) and higher temperature (closer to uniform sampling). For random projection, we observe sensitivity to the sketch dimension: m=8192 provides the strongest results among the tested dimensions. Based on these results, we adopt bt=64, τ=0.9, and m=8192 as our default configuration. Preprint. Under review. Figure 7: Efficiency and computational cost analysis.

Static filtering methods incur substantial one-time cost to score the entire corpus, while dynamic selection adds per-iteration scoring during training. As shown in Figure 7, naıve direct implementation of online selection would incur over 3.5 slowdown compared to random sampling. By incorporating ghost gradients and CountSketch projections, OPUS reduces this overhead to only 4.7% while achieving the best benchmark performance. In contrast, static methods like QuRating require more compute for selection yet fail to outperform OPUS."

For each method, we show selected candidates and not selected samples, candidate index, and the methods raw score (see Appendix A). Overall, OPUS tends to select more diverse mixture of documents, covering both instructional content and broader web text, rather than concentrating on narrow educational-only slice. In contrast, several static filtering method exhibit more extreme preferenceseither strongly favoring highly lowdiversity patterns or focusing on limited subset of high-loss samples. These examples support our empirical findings: OPUSs optimizer-aware utility and stochastic sampling encourage selections that remain broadly suitable for general-purpose pre-training, while still being guided towards high quality samples that align with the proxy direction."

Across model scales, optimizers, and corpus quality settings, OPUS consistently improves compute-matched pre-training, suggesting that selection can be substantially strengthened by accounting for how the optimizer actually moves parameters. natural next step is to extend this optimizer-aligned idea to richer training regimes, such as data mixtures."
