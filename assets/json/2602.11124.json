Introduction Physical AI has emerged as new frontier that involves visual perception, physical commonsense, spatial reasoning, and action-centric decision making within single computational framework. Unlike traditional visual recognition tasks, physical AI requires model to interpret complex multi-view observations, understand object affordances, reason over causal dynamics, and assess how hypothetical actions unfold in real environments. This paradigm spans 3D perception and spatial grounding Zhang et al. (2025), robot-centric interaction understanding Bu et al. (2025); Sermanet et al. (2024); Walke et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023), and safetycritical domains such as autonomous driving Marcu et al. (2024); Nie et al. (2024); Sima et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2025). As these systems grow in scale and autonomy, the community increasingly relies on multimodal evaluation to measure whether models reasoning is physically correct, visually grounded, and aligned with human expectations. However, despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the development of reliable multimodal critic modelsmodels that evaluate other models outputslags far behind. Existing reward or judge models focus predominantly on general domains such as captioning, STEM reasoning, and image question answering Lee et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025,, 2026); Xiong et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025). Yet, evaluation in physical AI is fundamentally different: the critic must assess whether reasoning is causally valid, whether visual explanation adheres to actual physical configurations, and whether the final answer respects temporal, spatial, and dynamical constraints. Recent works have started to extend multimodal judges and RL-based critic training Wang et al. (2025,); Zhang et al. (2025) to physical-related scenarios, while early efforts such as DriveCritic Song et al. (2025) underscore the importance of domain-specific judgment capabilities. But existing critics remain limited in three essential ways. (1) They lack physics awareness, often failing to distinguish visually coherent but physically impossible reasoning. (2) Their training data focuses on broad multimodal evaluation rather than physically grounded scenarios involving manipulation, affordance reasoning, or embodied 3D interactions. (3) They do not ground * Work done during an internship at NVIDIA. Corresponding author: zhidingy@nvidia.com. Additional affiliations: 1 University of Maryland, College Park. 2026 NVIDIA.

PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI Figure 1: PhyCritic first produces its own physics-aware reasoning and prediction, then explicitly applies it as reference in judging pair of model responses. In this example, PhyCritic first infers in its own prediction that the oven is closed\". Based on this insight, the model then correctly identifies Response 1 as following the proper causal sequence while Response 2 proposes an unnecessary action. This self-referential process leads to more stable, physically correct judgments. their decisions in their own physical understanding of the question, which potentially leads to inconsistent or superficial verdicts. In contrast, recent advances in reinforcement-finetuned multimodal policy models show that RLVR-style verifiable rewards Huang et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2025); Shen et al. (2025); Yu et al. (2025) and physically grounded reasoning datasets Azzolini et al. (2025) can significantly improve multimodal reasoning and temporal consistency. Yet, these insights have not been systematically transferred to physical-related critic models, especially in settings where judgments must reflect physical truth rather than linguistic form. Our goal. We propose to bridge this gap by developing new class of multimodal critics specifically designed for physical AI. Our model, called PhyCritic, aims to evaluate multimodal responses involving physical perception, causal reasoning, and action or plan assessment, and to do so in manner that is grounded, stable, and physically correct. As shown in Fig. 1, PhyCritic introduces the principle that strong physical critic should behave like an expert human judge: before evaluating other models responses, it should first solve the problem itself. This intuition motivates self-referential critic finetuning, two-stage reinforcement training framework: Stage 1: we apply standard GRPO on small set of physical-related questionanswer pairs to strengthen the models core physical perception and reasoning abilities, serving as warm-up phase. Stage 2: Building upon the Stage-1 warm-up, the critic is trained to (i) generate its own internal reasoning and prediction for the question, and then (ii) evaluate candidate responses with explicit reference to this self-prediction. Using GRPO with both critic and self-prediction rewards encourages stable critic behavior and coherent physics-aware reasoning. new benchmark for physical critics. To rigorously evaluate judgment performance in physical contexts, we introduce PhyCritic-Bench, novel benchmark explicitly targeting multimodal critic models for physical AI. Built from diverse embodied datasets such as RoboVQA, BridgeData V2, HoloAssist, and AgiBot World, PhyCritic-Bench includes high-quality physical reasoning questions derived from Cosmos-Reason1 and paired candidate responses scored via verifiable ground truth. This enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning correctness, visual grounding, and causal validity. 2 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI Contributions. Our main contributions in this work are summarized as follows: We introduce self-referential critic learning framework that explicitly grounds the evaluation process in the models own physical perception and reasoning, implemented with two-stage RLVR + GRPO pipeline. We develop PhyCritic, multimodal critic specialized for assessing perception, causal reasoning, and planning in physical AI scenarios. We construct high-quality physical critic dataset spanning diverse embodied domains with paired candidate responses and verifiable preference labels. We introduce PhyCritic-Bench, benchmark for evaluating multimodal critic models in physical contexts. We demonstrate strong empirical gains across physical reasoning benchmarks (Cosmos-Reason1, CVBench, EgoPlan-Bench2) and general reward benchmarks (VL-RewardBench, Multimodal RewardBench), outperforming all open-source 7B/8B baselines. Together, these results demonstrate that critic models benefit significantly from self-referential physical grounding, and that physical AI requires new generation of physics-aware multimodal judge models. 2. Related Works VLMs for physical AI. Recent progress in visionlanguage models (VLMs) has expanded their scope from passive perception to physical AI tasks requiring perception, action, and spatial reasoning. For spatial and 3D understanding, SPAR-7M and SPAR-Bench Zhang et al. (2025) establish large-scale 3D-aware QA benchmarks to enhance multi-view and video-based grounding, while models such as 3D-LLM Hong et al. (2023) and PointLLM Guo et al. (2023) integrate point-cloud features for open-vocabulary geometric reasoning. In autonomous driving, benchmarks including Lingo-QA Marcu et al. (2024), DriveLM Sima et al. (2024), Reason2Drive Nie et al. (2024), and DriveBench Xie et al. (2025) assess multimodal reasoning, planning, and robustness under safety-critical conditions. VisionLanguageAction (VLA) frameworks such as RT-2 Zitkovich et al. (2023) and OpenVLA Kim et al. (2024) unify perception, language, and control within single policy space, while Open-X-Embodiment ONeill et al. (2024) facilitates large-scale cross-robot generalization through shared representation learning. Cosmos-Reason-1 Azzolini et al. (2025) further introduces physically grounded chain-of-thought reasoning via supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning, bridging perception and planning for embodied agents. Despite progress in perception and action, existing models often overlook the physical correctness and causal validity of their reasoning. PhyCritic introduces physics-aware critic for diagnostic evaluation in physical AI. Multimodal reward and critic models. Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been extended beyond perception and reasoning to act as evaluators, assessing the quality of model-generated responses. Early studies showed that proprietary models such as GPT-4V Zhang et al. (2023) align closely with human judgments across diverse multimodal evaluation tasks. Subsequent work fine-tuned open-source VLMs into reward or critic models, typically following two paradigms: (1) BT-style reward modeling with explicit scalar heads to predict preference scores Sun et al. (2023); Zang et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025), and (2) generative judges that produce textual reasoning and final verdicts in an autoregressive manner Lee et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025,); Xiong et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025), or combine both approaches Zhang et al. (2025). Later extensions incorporated critic training with reinforcement learning Wang et al. (2025,); Zhang et al. (2025) to enhance judgment accuracy. However, most efforts remain focused on general visual domains such as captioning, STEM reasoning, or visual question answering, leaving physical AI scenarios underexplored. Among earlier attempts, WorldModelBench Li et al. (2025) evaluates video-generation models on instruction following and physics adherence, underscoring the need for physics-aware multimodal evaluation. More recently, DriveCritic Song et al. (2025) employed LMM-based critics to assess trajectory pairs in autonomous driving, yet its scope remains and does not apply to diverse, grounded multimodal text responses. Our work broadens the critic capabilities 3 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI Figure 2: PhyCritic training pipeline. We begin with GRPO training on physical-related QA pairs to enhance the VLMs physical reasoning ability (left), followed by self-referential critic finetuning to further develop its critique capacity (right). of open-source VLMs toward general physical AI domains, emphasizing evaluation settings that involve physical perception, reasoning, and planning. Multimodal reinforcement finetuning. Reinforcement finetuning has proven effective in enhancing the capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Early explorations applied reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF Ouyang et al. (2022)) and AI feedback (RLAIF Lee et al. (2023)) paradigms, typically using PPO Schulman et al. (2017) or DPO Rafailov et al. (2023), to mitigate hallucinations Sun et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2024, 2025) and improve video understanding Zhang et al. (2025). Following the success of DeepSeek-R1 Guo et al. (2025), subsequent studies have increasingly adopted Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches to strengthen visual reasoning in multimodal mathematics and science Huang et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2025,); Meng et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2025); Yang et al. (2025), perception-related tasks Shen et al. (2025); Yu et al. (2025); Zhou et al. (2025), video reasoning Feng et al. (2025), and domain-specific applications including medical imaging Lai et al. (2025), GUI agents Luo et al. (2025), and robotic reasoning Azzolini et al. (2025). These efforts primarily target tasks with verifiable ground-truth supervision, aiming to improve models as policy for problem solving. More recently, RLVR-based methods have been extended to multimodal critic finetuningtraining models to evaluate rather than generate responsesthereby enhancing judgment accuracy on image-grounded tasks Li et al.; Wang et al. (2025,); Zhang et al. (2025). PhyCritic extends multimodal RLVR to develop physical critics that evaluate responses involving perception, action, and planning in physical contexts, while enhancing the models ability for physical reasoning. 3. PhyCritic: Physical Critic for VLMs Inspired by human critical thinking Lai (2011), we identify two key principles for consolidating physics-related critic capacities in VLMs. (1) These capacities should be developed from models intrinsic ability for physicsrelated perception and reasoning. (2) Building on the success of multimodal critics in both general image understanding Lee et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025); Xiong et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025) and visual generation domains Liu et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2025), critic performance should be consolidated through explicit critic training with strong preference signals. Therfore, PhyCritic adopts two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline. Starting from base model, we first fine-tune it on small set of physical-related question-answer pairs to enhance its physical perception and reasoning. We then introduce self-referential critic fine-tuning, reinforcement learning stage where the critic is prompted to generate its own prediction for the users query before evaluating pairs of model responses. An overview is provided in Fig. 2. 4 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI 3.1. Task Formulation To implement this mechanism, our training data are organized as tuples (𝑄, 𝐿𝐴, 𝐿𝐵, 𝐴𝑄, 𝑃 ), where: 𝑄 denotes multimodal prompt consisting of user question together with visual inputs; 𝐿𝐴 and 𝐿𝐵 are two candidate responses to be evaluated; 𝐴𝑄 denotes the ground-truth answer to 𝑄; 𝑃 𝐴, 𝐵 is binary preference label indicating which response demonstrates higher quality. 3.2. Two-Stage Training Pipeline As existing VLMs are primarily trained on general imagetext pairs with limited exposure to physically grounded data, we devise two-stage training pipeline to enhance physical critic capacity. Stage 1: Physical Skill Warmup with RLVR. Before introducing the complex critic task, we first ensure that the model possesses solid foundational perception and reasoning capabilities within the physical domain. In this stage, we use verifiable dataset containing only (𝑄, 𝐴𝑄) pairs and adopt standard reinforcement learning setup with accuracy reward 𝑟 = I( ˆ𝐴𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑(𝑄) = 𝐴𝑄) The objective is to align the model to produce accurate and reliable predictions ˆ𝐴pred, establishing strong foundation for critic training in the next stage. Stage 2: Self-Referential Critic Finetuning. After acquiring foundational physical capacities, we utilize the complete dataset (𝑄, 𝐿𝐴, 𝐿𝐵, 𝐴Q, 𝑃 ) to align the models judgment over pair of responses, ˆ𝑃pred(𝑄, 𝐿𝐴, 𝐿𝐵), with the ground-truth preference label 𝑃 . As will be illustrated in Section 3.3, this stage encourages the model to anchor its external critic judgment to its internal self-prediction ˆ𝐴pred, thereby promoting the development of more grounded and interpretable physical critic capacities. 3.3. Self-Referential Critic Finetuning Our core idea is that critics judgment should be grounded in its own understanding of the problem. Therefore, during training, the model 𝜋𝜃 is required to perform two tasks concurrently: 1. Self-Prediction: The model first generates its own internal prediction ˆ𝐴𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 in response to the prompt 𝑄. 2. Preference Judgement: Subsequently, acting as critic, the model produces its preference prediction ˆ𝑃pred for the context (𝑄, 𝐿𝐴, 𝐿𝐵), while being explicitly instructed to ground its evaluation process on the previously generated self-prediction ˆ𝐴pred. Reward Design. The total reward 𝑟total is composed of an accuracy reward 𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑐 and format reward 𝑟𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡. where 𝛼form is weighting coefficient for format reward. 𝑟𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑐 + 𝑟𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚 * 𝛼𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚 Accuracy Reward. In self-referential critic fine-tuning, the accuracy reward 𝑟acc consists of two components: Self-Prediction Reward (𝑟sp): Evaluates the correctness of the models internal knowledge by comparing its self-prediction ˆ𝐴pred with the ground-truth answer 𝐴Q: 𝑟sp = I( ˆ𝐴pred = 𝐴Q) which encourages the VLM to first become reliable problem solver. Critic Reward (𝑟crit): Evaluates the models judgment capability as critic by checking whether its 5 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI You are an expert in evaluating responses from multimodal models. Your task is to compare two model responses to the same question grounded on the provided image or video. You should assess both the quality of the reasoning process and the factual correctness of the final answer in each response. Your evaluation should focus on two main aspects: 1. Reasoning Process Quality: Evaluate the models reasoning based on the following aspects: Truthfulness: All factual statements must be correct and verifiable. No fabricated details or contradictions with the visual input; Visual Groundedness: The reasoning must accurately reference and interpret visual elements from the provided image or video; Logical Validity: The reasoning should follow logically consistent, stepby-step progression; Efficiency and Clarity: Reasoning should be clear, purposeful, and focused. Thoughtful self-correction is acceptable, but avoid unnecessary repetition or irrelevant information. 2. Final Answer Accuracy: Evaluate whether the final answer is factually correct given the question and the visual input. Here are the inputs for evaluation: [Question]:{question}; [Response 1]:{resp1}; [Response 2]:{resp2} To begin your evaluation, first generate your own reasoning process towards solving the question, enclosing it within <pred_think></pred_think>. Then, provide your own answer to the question in <pred></pred>. After that, provide detailed justification comparing the two responses, using your own response as reference point. Evaluate each response according to the criteria above, considering both reasoning quality and final answer correctness. Your explanation must clearly reference specific details from both responses, your own response, and the visual evidence. Finally, make clear and strict decision on which response is better overall. Output your decision in one of the following formats: Response 1 is better; Response 2 is better You FIRST write your reasoning process to the question in <pred_think></pred_think>, THEN generate your own answer in <pred></pred>, THEN think about the comparison and judgment process as an internal monologue (enclosed within <think></think>), and FINALLY provide the final answer in boxed{}. Table 1: Critic prompt for self-referential critic fine-tuning. After presenting detailed evaluation criteria, it explicitly instructs the judge model to first generate its own reasoning and prediction for the given question, then use its self-prediction as reference during the critique process. Format prompt regions are highlighted in green. predicted preference ˆ𝑃crit matches the golden preference 𝑃 : 𝑟crit = I( ˆ𝑃crit(𝑄, 𝐿𝐴, 𝐿𝐵) = 𝑃 ) The overall accuracy reward 𝑟acc is computed as weighted sum of the two components: where 𝛼sp and 𝛼crit are weighting coefficients controlling their relative importance. 𝑟acc = 𝛼sp𝑟sp + 𝛼crit𝑟crit Format Reward (𝑟form). This reward evaluates whether the critics output follows the predefined self-referential structure: 𝑟form = 1.0 if <pred_think>, <pred>, <think> and boxed{} exist, 0.5 if only <think> and boxed{} exist, 0 otherwise. Optimization Algorithm. Inspired by the strong performance DeepSeek-R1 Guo et al. (2025), we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as the optimization algorithm. GRPO is policy-gradient based reinforcement-learning method originally introduced in the context of mathematical reasoning Shao et al. (2024). It omits the need for learned value-network in PPO, and instead computes advantages by comparing 6 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI multiple sampled trajectories as group. ℒGRPO E𝑜𝜋𝜃 [ min(𝜌𝑜𝐴𝑜, clip(𝜌𝑜, 1 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖)𝐴𝑜)] 𝛽 𝒟KL(𝜋𝜃𝜋ref ) where 𝜌𝑜 = 𝜋𝜃(𝑜) 𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑜) each outcome reward 𝑟𝑜 for the sampled trace 𝑜. is the probability ratio, 𝐴𝑜 = 𝑟𝑜𝑟 std(𝑟) is the group-relative advantage, computed by normalizing Critic Prompt. As shown in Tab. 1, we design rigorous critic prompt template that explicitly instructs the model to follow clear set of predefined evaluation criteria, and to reference its critique process with respect to its own prediction. Following DeepSeek-R1 Guo et al. (2025), we append format prompt at the end to standardize the models reasoning behavior and output structure. 3.4. Critic Training Dataset To enhance critic capacities, we construct dataset spanning diverse physical scenarios and video domains, paired with high-quality questions probing perception, reasoning, and causality. Candidate responses of varying quality enable the critic to learn nuanced distinctions in reasoning accuracy and visual grounding. We select videos from four major robotics and embodied datasetsRoboVQA Sermanet et al. (2024), BridgeData V2 Walke et al. (2023), HoloAssist Wang et al. (2023), and AgiBot World Bu et al. (2025)covering both egocentric and third-person views, wide range of manipulation behaviors (e.g., grasping, stacking, folding, assembling), and diverse physical contexts from simulated kitchens to real-world workspaces. For questions, we build upon the Cosmos-Reason1 RL dataset Azzolini et al. (2025), which provides 800 high-quality questionanswer pairs requiring rich physical perception, planning, and reasoning capacities. Model outputs are collected from seven multimodal models spanning proprietary (GPT-4o Hurst et al. (2024), Gemini-2.5-Flash Comanici et al. (2025)), open-source (Qwen2.5-VL-72B Bai et al. (2025), InternVL3-38B Zhu et al. (2025)), and RL-finetuned systems with enhanced long-horizon reasoning (Cosmos-Reason1-7B Azzolini et al. (2025), Video-R1 Feng et al. (2025), MiMo-VL-7B Team et al. (2025)). All models are prompted in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) manner to produce explicit reasoning traces with their final responses. For ground-truth critic preference, we apply simple accuracy-based labeling: GPT-4o verifies each response against the ground-truth answer and assigns binary score (1 = preferred, 0 = rejected). We then construct response pairs, each consisting of one chosen and one rejected response. After balancing response lengths and distribution, we obtain final critic dataset of 3,258 samples. 4. PhyCritic-Bench Existing multimodal reward benchmarks primiarily cover prompts from general visual domains such as captioning Ye et al. (2025), STEM reasoning Chen et al. (2024); Xiong et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025) and general image question answering Li et al. (2025); Yasunaga et al. (2025), does not cover physical AI domains that involves judgments related to physical perception, actions and planning. We thus introduce PhyCriticBench, fine-grained and challeging benchmark targeted in physical AI domains for multimodal judge models.

Best and second-best results of open-source VLMs are marked in bold and underline, respectively. *MM-RB. is an abbreviated form of Multimodal RewardBench Yasunaga et al. (2025). PhyCritic-Bench primarily comprises 225 evaluation samples covers evaluations in two physical-AI scenarios: 1) Robotics tasks videos from RoboVQA Sermanet et al. (2024), BridgeData V2 Walke et al. (2023), HoloAssist Wang et al. (2023), AgiBot Bu et al. (2025), and RoboFail Liu et al. (2023), with questions adapted from CosmosReason1-Bench Azzolini et al. (2025); 2) Autonomous driving videos and actionor prediction-related questions from LingoQA Marcu et al. (2024). Model responses are collected from seven VLMs spanning proprietary, open-source, and RL-finetuned families. An overview of the prompt and response model statistics is shown in Fig. 3. Following prior works, we formulate each evaluation instance in PhyCritic-Bench as pairwise preference tuple (𝑥, 𝑙𝑎, 𝑙𝑏, 𝑝), where 𝑞 is the multimodal prompt containing the visual input and user query, 𝑙𝑎 and 𝑙𝑏 are candidate responses, and 𝑝 𝑎, 𝑏 is the ground-truth preference label. For response-pair and preference-label construction, we follow the JudgeBench Tan et al. (2024) pipeline. Each prompt is assigned to one model from pool, which generates 𝑁 =8 CoT responses via temperature sampling. GPT-4o verifies each response against the ground-truth answer, identifying correct and incorrect predictions. The final pair comprises one correct and one incorrect response, with correctness serving as the preference label. During evaluation, each VLM acts as pairwise judge, and performance is measured by its preference consistency with the ground truth: 𝐴𝑐𝑐 = I(VLM(𝑞, 𝑙𝑎, 𝑙𝑏) = 𝑝) 5. Experiments Implementation Details. We adopt Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct Bai et al. (2025) as our base model and the veRL framework for RL finetuning. In the warmup stage, we train the model using vanilla GRPO on the Cosmos-Reason1-RL dataset Azzolini et al. (2025) for 80 steps. In the critic finetuning stage, we perform self-referential critic finetuning for 300 steps. For both stages, we use batch size of 128, learning rate of 1 106, and set the KL coefficient to 0.01. For critic finetuning, we set 𝛼𝑠𝑝 = 0.2, 𝛼𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 0.7 and 𝛼𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 0.1. Evaluation Benchmark. We evaluate our approach on both critic performance and its capacity for handling Physical-AI tasks. For critic performance, we use our curated PhyCritic-Bench for physical-related critique, together with two general reward benchmarksVL-RewardBench Li et al. (2025) and MultimodalRewardBench Yasunaga et al. (2025)to evaluate critic capacity in general visual understanding and knowledgeintensive reasoning. For physical capacity, we evaluate our methods on three physical-related multimodal benchmarks. CosmosReason1-Bench probes physical commonsense and causal/affordance reasoning across agility, holistic perception, robot-VQA, tool-use/bridging, and failure-robustness sub-tasks Azzolini et al.

EgoPlanBench2 targets egocentric daily-task planning (Daily/Hobbies/Recreation/Work), measuring the full perceptiondecompositionplanning pipeline Qiu et al. (2024). Baselines. We compare PhyCritic against two groups of baselines. (1) General-purpose VLMs: leading opensource models trained for visual instruction following, including Qwen2.5-VL-7B Bai et al. (2025) and Eagle2.58B Chen et al. (2025). (2) Physical reasoningoriented VLMs two representative lines built upon the same Qwen2.5-VL backbone as ours: Cosmos-Reason1 Azzolini et al. (2025), optimized for physical reasoning through large-scale supervised finetuning on millions of physical common-sense and embodied reasoning samples distilled from DeepSeek-R1 traces, followed by reinforcement finetuning on object interaction and temporal-consistency tasks; and RoboBrain2 Team et al. (2025), perception-to-action model trained via multi-stage supervised and reinforcement finetuning that emphasizes task decomposition, subgoal generation, and robustness in embodied environments. 5.1. Main Results SOTA open-source 7B/8B critic on physical judgment. On PhyCritic-Bench (Tab. 2), our model attains the best overall accuracy among open-source 7B/8B models (68.0), outperforming leading general-purpose VLMsEagle-2.5-8B (56.0; +12.0), Qwen2.5-VL-7B (51.6; +16.4)as well as the RL-finetuned physical models RoboBrain2.0-7B (54.7; +13.3) and Cosmos-R1-7B (51.1; +16.9). Across sub-suites, PhyCritic-7B delivers best or tied-best performance on AgiBot (78.8), HoloAssist (65.5; tied), and RoboVQA (86.7), while ranking second on Bridge-v2 (65.6). Notably, its strong judgment capability also generalizes to unseen subdomains, achieving top performance on RoboFail (57.4; tied with the base Qwen2.5-VL) and LingoQA (60.0; tied best). While physical-related RL by itself offers limited benefit to accuracy, our two-stage pipeline yields strict and stable judge capable of handling embodied tasks with long-horizon, affordance-centric reasoning. From physical critic to general-domain judging. As in Tab. 2, despite being tuned only in physical contexts, PhyCritic generalizes well to general-domain judging scenarios. On VL-RewardBench and MultimodalRewardBench, it outperforms the Qwen2.5-VL base model by +4.1 and +1.9 overall, with consistent gains across general, hallucination-related, and reasoning-related judgments. These results suggest that our physical critic trainingrooted in physical perception, planning, and action evaluationtransfers effectively to broader multimodal judging across general visual domains. Improved physical reasoning as policy. As shown in Tab. 3, PhyCritic not only judges well but also strengthens policy-like physical task handling. On CosmosReason1-Bench, it achieves the best open-source accuracy (63.9), surpassing Cosmos-R1-7B (63.0; +0.9), even though the latter is trained on millions of 9 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI in-domain distilled reasoning traces followed by RL finetuning. This strong performance further generalizes to physical perception and reasoning tasks beyond the training distribution. On CV-Bench, PhyCritic-7B achieves the second-best average (79.7) and the best 3D score (83.9), demonstrating improved spatial grounding and cross-view consistency. On EgoPlanBench2, PhyCritic-7B ranks second overall (42.3) with top-two performance across all domains, highlighting robust egocentric planning capabilities. Data efficiency. Notably, our two-stage RL pipeline requires only 80+300 RL steps, with total of 4,058 training samples. In contrast to approaches that depend on millions of supervised traces, PhyCritic leverages verifiable physical QA and self-referential critic signals, enabling more data-efficient path toward strong critic and policy performance. 5.2. Ablation Studies We further conduct two ablation studies to evaluate the impact of the two-stage RL pipeline and the proposed self-referential critic finetuning on model performance.

We compare our method against various RL strategies. In all experiments, 𝑠1 uses 80 RL steps and 𝑠2 uses 300. As shown in Tab. 4, our two-stage pipeline achieves the best results across physical critic judgment, physical reasoning, and general-domain evaluation. Stage 1 physical RL improves physical reasoning (+7.5 on CosmosReason1Bench) but brings limited judgment gains (+2.0 on PhyCritic-Bench), while Stage 2 mainly strengthens critic capability (+14.4 on PhyCritic-Bench) and further enhances reasoning performance (+2.1 on CosmosReason1-Bench). Notably, the full pipeline surpasses physical RL alone in both stages on physical reasoning tasks, showing that critic training further pushes the models problem-solving capacities. Overall, these results indicate that (i) Stage 1 builds foundational physical skills through policy RL warmup, and (ii) Stage 2 self-referential critic finetuningleveraging diverse reasoning traces and high-quality preference signalsfurther consolidates judgment consistency, improves generalization, and reduces overfitting.

VL-Reward. overall macro overall macro Self-referential critic finetuning drives the gains. As shown in Tab. 5, removing the explicit selfreferential process during finetuning (no self-refer.) reduces PhyCritic-Bench performance from 68.0 to 64.4 (3.6). Keeping the self-reference prompt but removing the self-prediction reward 𝑅sp leads to smaller yet noticeable drop to 65.8 (2.2). Similar trends appear on CosmosR1-Bench (63.9 62.6 / 63.5) and VL-Reward (57.3 56.6 / 56.5). By explicitly instructing the judge model to ground its evaluations in its own reasoning and problem-solving behavior, and by applying rewards that reinforce accurate self-reasoning, the model simultaneously learns to produce generalized, consistent judgment and faithful reasoning. 68.0 - no self-refer. 64.4 65.8 - no 𝑟sp Table 5: Ablations on self-referential critic finetuning. 69.0 63.8 64.8 63.3 61.9 62.9 63.9 62.6 63.5 57.3 56.6 56.5 PhyCritic-7B overall 5.3. Analysis Better self-predictions better judgments. To assess how self-prediction accuracy affects judgment quality, we conduct chi-square tests between the correctness of PhyCritic own answer and its downstream judgment in the self-referential critic process. The Stage 1 model with physical RL warmup already shows strong positive association (𝜒2 = 51.07, 𝑝 = 8.93 1013), and self-referential critic finetuning further strengthens 10 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI this dependence in the final model (𝜒2 = 161.76, 𝑝 = 4.66 1037). These results support the premise that strong physics-aware critic should solve before judging, using its own grounded prediction to avoid spurious correlations and unsupported verdicts. Limitations. While self-referential critic fine-tuning has proven more effective than conventional pairwise critic training, it additionally requires ground-truth answers for the multimodal prompts. Although actions and planning can often be verified through physical-world feedback, this requirement limits its applicability to fully open-ended scenarios. Future work may explore self-verification or meta-judging strategies to replace the explicit accuracy reward used for self-prediction. Furthermore, PhyCritic could be extended toward multi-round critic self-refinement, leveraging critic signals to iteratively improve self-generation. 6. Conclusion We presented PhyCritic, multimodal critic model tailored for physical AI scenarios involving perception, causal reasoning, and action or plan evaluation. By introducing two-stage RLVR pipeline with self-referential critic finetuning, PhyCritic grounds its judgments in its own physically informed predictions, yielding more consistent, interpretable evaluations and stronger physical reasoning. We further introduced PhyCritic-Bench, challenging benchmark for physical-domain multimodal judging. Experiments show that PhyCritic achieves the best performance among open-source 7B/8B models on physical judgment, generalizes well to broader multimodal reward tasks, and enhances physical reasoning. Together with our analysis, PhyCritic paves the way toward more reliable, physical-aware multimodal AI evaluation systems. 11 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI A. Additional Results and Analysis In this section, we first analyze the robustness of (i) reward weight hyperparameters and (ii) critic prompt design; we then validate PhyCritic as reward for (iii) test-time scaling and (iv) downstream policy training, and finally compare it with (v) general-domain multimodal critic. Ablations on 𝛼𝑠𝑝. We fix the format reward weight at 𝛼𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 0.1 and vary the selfprediction reward weight 𝛼𝑠𝑝 while setting the critic reward weight to 𝛼𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 0.9 𝛼𝑠𝑝. As shown in Tab. 6, PhyCritic exhibits relatively robust performance across different choices of 𝛼𝑠𝑝. We adopt 𝛼𝑠𝑝 = 0.2 in our final configuration, as it provides the best overall balance across judge and reasoning benchmarks. 𝛼𝑠𝑝 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.

Table 6: Ablations on the self-prediction reward weight (𝛼𝑠𝑝). Critic Prompt PhyCritic-B. CosmosR1-B. VL-Reward. overall macro overall macro Ablations on critic prompts. As shown in Tab. 1, our critic prompts include detailed evaluation criteria that guide the models rollout during the critic processfor example, truthfulness, visual groundedness, logical validity, and efficiency for reasoning assessments. To assess the importance of these hand-crafted criteria, we conduct an ablation study that removes all criteria and report the results in Tab. 7. Removing the criteria leads to clear drops in judgment accuracy, physical reasoning performance, and generalization to image-domain judgments. Since our GRPO objective relies only on the self-prediction reward 𝑟𝑠𝑝 and critic accuracy reward 𝑟𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡, the criteria in the critic prompts become crucial for shaping and regularizing PhyCritic critic reasoning behavior during reinforcement finetuning.

(2025), which uses simple pairwise critic prompt for general-domain critic training. Our results indicate that building reliable critic capabilities for physical-AI tasks is considerably more challenging and requires explicit, structured critic guidance. PhyCritic for best-of-N sampling. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of PhyCritic as test-time scaling judge for best-of-𝑁 sampling. We first employ Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the policy model to generate 𝑁 candidate reasoning trajectories for each question in CosmosReason1-Bench Azzolini et al. (2025) under thinking prompt with temperature of 𝜏 = 0.6. PhyCritic-7B is then applied through pairwise knockout procedure: starting from the first two trajectories, PhyCritic judges the pair and advances the preferred response to compete with the next candidate. This process continues for 𝑁 1 rounds until final winner is selected. We compare this strategy against three baselines: 1) majority voting over the final predicted answers; 2) using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct Bai et al. (2025) itself as the judge for pairwise knockout; and 3) using the physical RL-finetuned Cosmos-Reason1-7B Azzolini et al. (2025) as the judge. Figure 4: Comparison of Best-of-𝑁 ensemble mechanisms on CosmosReason1-Bench. Using PhyCritic-7B as the judge consistently improves the base Qwen2.5-VL7B-Instruct model. 12 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI As shown in Fig. 4, applying PhyCritic to select the best reasoning trajectory yields the most consistent performance gains as 𝑁 increases, achieving +6.5-point improvement at 𝑁 = 32 for the base model on CosmosReason1-Bench (60.8 vs 54.3). In contrast, using the physically finetuned Cosmos-Reason1-7B or the base Qwen2.5-VL models as the critic yield much smaller or even no improvements, reflecting their limited physical-domain judgment capacity. By reliably identifying the high-quality trajectory among multiple candidates, PhyCritic serves as an effective ensemble mechanism for enhancing test-time performance. PhyCritic for downstream policy training. To validate PhyCritic as reward signal for guiding downstream policy training, we apply PhyCritic within self-improving DPO framework. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7BInstruct, we generate 8 responses per prompt on Cosmos-RL data, use PhyCritic-7B to score all ordered response pairs and select bestworst responses as preference pairs for DPO training (learning rate 1e6, 5 epochs). The resulting DPO-trained policy is evaluated on CosmosReason1-Bench. As shown in Tab. 8, PhyCritic-guided DPO achieves substantial gains over the base Qwen2.5-VL model and consistently outperforms an answer-verifier baseline (random correctincorrect pairs), indicating that PhyCritic provides an effective reward signal beyond answer correctness for improving downstream physical reasoning.

Comparison with general-domain critic. We compare PhyCritic with UnifiedReward-Think Wang et al. (2025), recent multimodal reward model fine-tuned with RL on general understanding and generation preference data. As shown in Tab. 9, UnifiedReward-Think performs strongly on general-domain reward benchmarks, but shows only marginal gains on physical-domain judgment and reduced physical reasoning performance. In contrast, PhyCritic achieves robust gains on physical-domain judgment and reasoning, and its critic capacity transfers to general-domain judging, despite not being trained on general-domain critic data.

Qualitative Examples In this section, we provide additional case studies to further compare the judging and physical reasoning behaviors of PhyCritic with those of baseline models. Table 10 provides an example of PhyCritic judging pair of model responses for physical-related evaluation tasks via the self-referential critic process. By first generating its own reasoning to solve the problem and then explicitly referencing this reasoning during critique, PhyCritic can accurately distinguish differences in the quality of physical-related reasoning rather than relying on shallow stylistic cues, leading to more consistent judgments supported by grounded and clear justifications. Table 11 illustrates case where PhyCritic is used as policy model for physical reasoning. The selfreferential critic training process further strengthens its physical perception and reasoning capabilities, enabling PhyCritic to generate visually grounded and internally consistent reasoning that leads to reliable final answers. Table 12 presents an example of PhyCritic judging pair of model responses in general image domain. Although PhyCritic is trained exclusively on physical-related critic data, its physically grounded critic capability transfers effectively to broader visual tasks, enabling reliable and visually grounded judgments even when instructed to use different critic formats and to evaluate general image-based model responses. 14 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI PhyCritic in Judging Physical-Related Domains Question Response 1 Response 2 Ground Truth Qwen2.5-VL7B-Instruct PhyCritic-7B What should you do next in this driving scenario? A. Continue driving as the truck is stopped and you have the right of way. B. Stop and wait for the truck to move first. C. Reverse to allow the truck to proceed. D. Overtake the truck by entering the opposite lane. <think> In this scenario, the vehicles are on two-lane road with traffic in both directions. The UPS truck appears to be stationary or moving very slowly, creating potential obstruction. Although the reason for the stop is unclear, it is blocking the left lane. Option is unsafe since the truck may be stopped legitimately, and entering its lane could cause collision. Option safely checks that the road is clear before moving. Option is dangerous due to possible traffic behind you. Option is risky because of oncoming traffic. </think> <answer> </answer> <think> In this driving scenario, the UPS truck appears to be preparing to turn or has stopped temporarily, possibly to yield to oncoming traffic. However, the road ahead is clear, and there seems to be no immediate obstacle preventing the driver from continuing to drive forward safely. Since the truck is currently stationary and there is no sign indicating that the vehicle must stop, it suggests that the driver has the right of way. </think> <answer> </answer> Response 2 > Response 1 ### Response 1: - **Reasoning Process Quality**: - Truthfulness: The response correctly identifies that the UPS truck is stationary or moving slowly and may obstruct the lane. - Visual Groundedness: It references the image showing the UPS truck on the left side, partially blocking the left lane. - Logical Validity: The reasoning is soundassessing the trucks movement, the obstruction risk, and the safest action. - Efficiency and Clarity: The response is clear and concise, avoids repetition, and presents coherent flow of reasoning. - **Final Answer Accuracy**: The final answer is accurate; stopping and waiting for the truck to move first is indeed safe and responsible action. ### Response 2: - **Reasoning Process Quality**: - Truthfulness: The response correctly observes that the truck appears stationary or preparing to turn and notes no immediate obstacle. - Visual Groundedness: It references the visual evidence where the truck is visible on the left side and no traffic ahead obstructs the lane. - Logical Validity: The reasoning is logical, given the trucks stationary state and the unobstructed lane, and the conclusion about having the right of way is reasonable. - Efficiency and Clarity: The response is clear but slightly less structured than Response 1, as it does not explicitly outline all safety-checking steps. - **Final Answer Accuracy**: The final answer is accurate; continuing to drive as the truck is stopped and there is no immediate danger is safe and efficient. ### Evaluation Summary: Both responses demonstrate factual accuracy, strong visual grounding, coherent logical flow, and clear, efficient communication. However, **Response 1** is more comprehensive and structured, clearly detailing the steps for assessing the situation and identifying the safest action, which makes its reasoning easier to follow. Decision: <pred_think> The image shows busy street with UPS truck in the left lane, seemingly stopped or moving slowly. There are other cars and pedestrians on the sidewalks. Given the situation, the truck is not obstructing the right lane where the drivers car is positioned, allowing for safe passage. The road ahead is clear, and there is no visible sign that necessitates stopping. Therefore, the most logical action is to continue driving, assuming the truck will eventually move out of the way. </pred_think> <pred> </pred> <think> Both Model Responses 1 and 2 acknowledge that the truck is stationary and there is no immediate danger from the truck itself, allowing the driver to continue driving. However, they differ in their assessment of the safety and appropriateness of waiting versus continuing. Model Response 1 emphasizes the safety aspect by advising to stop and wait for the truck to move first, citing the possibility of the truck being stopped for legitimate reason. This response is grounded in the visual evidence that the truck is stationary and not obstructing the path, but it slightly overemphasizes the need to wait due to the lack of visible signs or indications that stopping is necessary. Model Response 2 correctly identifies that the truck is stationary and does not present an obstacle, allowing the driver to continue driving without waiting. This approach aligns well with the visual evidence and the logic of the situation. The road ahead is clear, and the truck is not obstructing the right lane, making it safe to continue driving. My reasoning process aligns more closely with Model Response 2. </think> boxed{Response 2 is better} Response 1 is better Table 10: Example on PhyCritic-Bench. Qwen2.5-VL-7B focuses on superficial structures and produces uninformative critiques. In contrast, PhyCritic delivers more aligned judgments by first identifying the trucks status during its own reasoning and then grounding this reasoning in the critic process, allowing it to accurately capture the quality differences between the responses. 15 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI PhyCritic in Physical Reasoning Question The overall goal is The student detaches the cover.\". The agent in the video is currently performing one subtask out of many to complete this goal. For the agent in the video, what is the most plausible next immediate subtask from the choices below? A: grab lens_cover B: grab dslr C: lift dslr D: place lens_cover Answer Cosmos-Reason1-7B <think> Okay, lets see. The user provided the video and the current action. The main goal is for the student to detach the cover. The agent is currently holding the camera with both hands, preparing to remove the lens cap. So, the current step is that the left hand is adjusting the lens cover. The next logical step after adjusting would be to actually take it off. Since the lens cap is already being handled, the next action should involve removing it. The options are (grab lens_cover), (grab dslr), (lift dslr), (place lens_cover). Option makes sense because once youve adjusted or positioned the lens cap correctly, the next step is to grab it to remove it. Option and involve grabbing or lifting the DSLR, which might not be necessary if the goal is just to detach the cover. Option suggests placing the lens cover somewhere else, but since the task is detachment, placing isnt the immediate next step. So the most plausible is A.</think> <answer> </answer> <think> The agent is holding camera with lens cover attached. The goal is to detach the cover. The agent has their hand on the lens cover, which suggests they are removing it. The most logical next step would be to place the lens cover down after detaching it. - Option (grab lens_cover) seems redundant since the lens cover is already being held. - Option (grab dslr) does not make sense because the agent should not be grabbing the camera again at this point. - Option (lift dslr) is incorrect because lifting the DSLR is not necessary to detach the lens cover. - Option (place lens_cover) aligns with the action needed to properly detach the lens cover. Therefore, the most plausible next immediate subtask is to place the lens cover. </think> boxed{D} PhyCritic-7B Table 11: Example of PhyCritic on CosmosReason1-Bench Azzolini et al. (2025). For policy-like problem solving on physical reasoning tasks, PhyCritic performs more visual-grounded, logically consistent, and efficient reasoning to infer the most plausible next subtask, without introducing stepwise contradictions. 16 PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI PhyCritic in Judging General Visual Domains (Out of Training Distribution) Question Response 1 Response 2 Ground Truth Qwen2.5-VL-7BInstruct PhyCritic-7B What color is the tissue box on the counter? The tissue box on the counter in the picture is green. The tissue box on the counter in the picture is white. Response 1 > Response 2 1. **Accuracy**: - Both responses directly address the color of the tissue box mentioned in the image query. However, only one of them can be correct based on what is visible in the image. - Based on the visual evidence in the image, there is no green present, confirming that Response 1 is not accurate. - The tissue box is indeed white in the image. 2. **Completeness**: - Both responses provide full responses to the question by naming single color. Complete responses are typically expected to include only relevant responses without additional unnecessary text. Both Response 1 and Response 2 do this well as they solely focus on the color. 3. **Clarity**: - Both responses are straightforward and unambiguous, making it clear what color the tissue box is. - There is no extraneous information, ensuring clarity for the reader. 4. **Relevance**: - Both responses directly relate to the question and the image by providing the color of specific object (the tissue box) mentioned in the query. - Neither response includes unrelated details, thus being relevant. **Overall Judgment**: After evaluating the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance, Response 2 is better. **1. Accuracy:** - **Response 1:** The tissue box on the counter appears green. **Response 2:** The tissue box on the counter appears white. **2. Completeness:** - Both responses provide straightforward response to the question about the color of the tissue box. However, they do not offer additional information that might not be relevant to the question, such as the location or condition of the tissue box. **3. Clarity:** - Both responses are clear and easy to understand. They directly response the question without ambiguity. **4. Relevance:** - Both responses directly relate to the question by addressing the color of the tissue box in the picture. **Overall Judgment:** - Response 1 is better because the color of the tissue box in the image is green, whereas Response 2 states it is white, which is incorrect. ### Detailed Response: - The tissue box on the counter is noticeably green, as seen in the image. It appears compact and situated near the sink. The surrounding surfaces are neutral in color, and the green hue of the tissue box contrasts with the lighter colors of the countertop and the sink. Final Response: Response 1 is better. Table 12: Example of PhyCritic on VL-RewardBench Lambert et al. (2024). Due to improved physical perception, PhyCritic accurately identifies the tissue box as green and avoids hallucinated colors, producing judgments that better align with human preference. Note that neither image-domain critic data nor the critic prompts used in VL-RewardBench were seen during PhyCritic training.
