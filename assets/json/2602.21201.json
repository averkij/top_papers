Introduction FirstProof (Abouzaid et al., 2026) is set of ten research-level math questions that arose naturally in the work of professional mathematicians, which was proposed as an assessment of current AI capabilities. The problems were released on February 5, 2026 and given deadline of 11:59pm PST on February 13, 2026, at which point solutions were released on the internet.

All rights reserved Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously study conducted by the team behind the Aletheia agent, with help on evaluations from other experts within Google; it is not representative of Googles collective efforts on FirstProof. Continuing our practice of transparency in AI for mathematical and scientific discovery (Luong and Mirrokni, 2026) and the concept of Human-AI Interaction (HAI) card introduced in (Feng et al., 2026b), we provided below the HAI card for how we have obtained solutions to FirstProof . Human-AI Interaction Card Prompt (problems copy-pasted verbatim from FirstProof .tex file) Human Aletheia Response Verification and extraction prompt (A) Human Gemini 3 Deep Think Response Raw prompts and outputs: https://github.com/google-deepmind/superhuman/tree/main/aletheia 2. Interpretation of the challenge Since FirstProof was construed as an experimental trial without clearly defined rules, we first discuss our interpretation of the challenge. The FirstProof authors write in the FAQ of 1stproof.org, What constitutes solution? We consider that an AI model has answered one of our questions if it can produce in an autonomous way proof that conforms to the levels of rigor and scholarship prevailing in the mathematics literature. In particular, the AI should not rely on human input for any mathematical idea or content, or to help it isolate the core of the problem. Citations should include precise statement numbers and should either be to articles published in peer-reviewed journals or to arXiv preprints. and in the paper (Abouzaid et al., 2026), ...it is not yet clear where AI systems stand at solving research-level math questions on their own, without an expert in the loop. Autonomy. Even with these guidelines, we felt some ambiguity about what constitutes an autonomous solution. For example: if an AI produces proof, and human reviewer asks for clarification on technical point, and the AI then elaborates to make the argument more rigorous, is the result considered autonomous? This sort of interaction happens all the time in human peer review. We think the answer could be yes, at least if the full transcript of the interaction is provided and observers agree that the human input does not contain mathematical ideas or content. On the other hand, for research problems at the caliber of FirstProof , expertise is already required to identify possible weak points to ask about, so such an interaction cannot occur without an expert in the loop. Another question was whether human expertise can be used to select the best solution out of number of attempts. Under our reading of the rules, this does not seem to be disallowed. But it offers potentially huge performance advantage, which seems orthogonal to the evaluation of AI capability. 2 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Our approach to the challenge guaranteed autonomy in the strictest sense: for the generation of our solutions, there was absolutely no human intervention. Humans experts inspected the final output of this pipeline for evaluation purposes only, without altering any content. We ran two different agents and designated one preferred solution per problem, whose ratings are displayed in Table 1. This designation admittedly draws upon our own expertise. Correctness. We interpreted Correct as meaning publishable after minor revisions, within the established range of the peer review process, consistent with the standards1 voiced by the FirstProof authors. In particular, we do not claim that our solutions are publication-ready as originally generated. Many fail to meet the stated requirement that Citations should include precise statement numbers and should either be to articles published in peer-reviewed journals or to arXiv preprints, but do meet the citation standards prevailing in the literature. We emphasize that this is only our own interpretation of the challenge. Other reasonable interpretations exist, and the authors of FirstProof make clear in (Abouzaid et al., 2026) that it is not intended as formal benchmark. 3. Methodology and results We prompted the agent Aletheia from (Feng et al., 2026b) with the problem statements from the FirstProof LATEX file, copy-pasted without any modification. The outputs of Aletheia were filtered, without any intermediate alteration, through pre-determined verification and extraction prompt (exposed in A) designed to the stated standards of the FirstProof authors to produce proof that conforms to the levels of rigor and scholarship prevailing in the mathematics literature. Moreover, the verification and extraction prompt elicited LATEX code directly as output, ensuring that manual intervention would not be required even for reformatting the response in LATEX document. We then tried to judge the outputs of this pipeline, in some cases asking for help among our colleagues. In this process, we did not interact with the model at allnot even by prompting for clarification or elaboration on points we did not understand. Our overall pipeline is illustrated below. For internal permissions reasons, we were not able to publicly release our results before official solutions were uploaded by the FirstProof authors on February 13, 11:59pm PST. In order to certify that our results were obtained without data contamination from these solutions, we e-mailed our solutions privately to the FirstProof authors at 11:07pm PST on February 13 (along with preliminary 1https://icarm.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/568090-first-proof/topic/Mathematical. 20standard/near/573992500 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously version of this document including Table 3, which represented our initial estimate of the correctness of the solutions at that point). We later shared2 our solutions publicly on February 18, 9:27am PST and Mohammed Abouzaid (lead FirstProof author) confirmed, in the same thread, the existence of our solutions before the deadline.3 3.1. Aletheia (Best of 2) We ran the agent Aletheia from (Feng et al., 2026b) on two different base models. These will be designated as follows: 1. Aletheia A: with the same base model as Gemini 3 Deep Think (The Deep Think Team, 2026) as of February 2026. 2. Aletheia B: with the January 2026 base model of Gemini, referenced in (Feng et al., 2026b). Aletheia Aletheia Zulip No output No output Correct No output No output Correct Correct Link No output No output Misinterpreted Link No output No output Critically Flawed Correct Inadequate Correct? Correct P10 Correct Correct Correct Link Link Link Link P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P8 P9 Table 2 Our current (post-deadline) estimation of the results based on the consensus of expert assessments. On P8, the expert assessment was not unanimous. We include links with public comments (on Zullip) for individual problems. On the 10 FirstProof problems, our agents produced solution candidates to 6 problems (P2, P5, P7, P8, P9, P10). From best-of-2 evaluation, the majority opinion of expert evaluations indicated that all 6 problems were solved correctly under this interpretation, although the assessments on P8 were not unanimous; there only 5 out of 7 experts rated it Correct. The assessment of individual solutions is displayed in Table 2. Section 3.2 discusses the evaluations in more detail. For the other 4 problems (P1, P3, P4, P6) both of our agents returned no solution: either by explicitly outputting No solution found, or by not returning any output within the time limit. This self-filtering feature was one of the key design principles of Aletheia; we view reliability as the primary bottleneck to scaling up AI assistance on research mathematics. We suspect that, given the limited 2https://icarm.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/568090-first-proof/topic/Aletheias. 20solutions 3Regrettably, there was one typo in our submission: the file labeled FP10_A.pdf was instead for Aletheia and should have been named FP10_B.pdf; the submission for Aletheia on FP#10 was omitted, and is now included as FP10_A.pdf. 4 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously bandwidth for human expert verification, many practicing researchers would prefer to trade raw problem-solving capability for increased accuracy.4 Inference cost. The inference-time computation expended by Aletheia on the FirstProof problems can be interpreted as rough proxy of the problem difficulty from the agents perspective. In Figure 1, we display the inference cost of each candidate solution as multiple of the inference cost of the solution to Erdős-1051 from (Feng et al., 2026a). Both base models used here are different from the one used in (Feng et al., 2026a), so the comparison is not on equal footing, but it gives some indication. For each problem, the inference cost exceeded that of Erdős-1051. For P7 in particular, the inference cost exceeded previously observed scales by an order of magnitude, both because the Generator subagent took much more computation to produce candidate solution, and because more interactions were require to pass the Verifier subagent. We note that while most of the FirstProof problems were described as Lemmas arising in the recent research of the authors, P7 was advertised as an open problem in the book of Weinberger (Weinberger, 2023), prior to its resolution by CappellWeinbergerYan (not published until the FirstProof solutions). Figure 1 Plot of the inference cost per FirstProof , as multiple of the inference cost of the solution to Erdős-1051 from (Feng et al., 2026a). Not all of the problems required large inference budget to solve. Aryan Mokhtari and David Woodruff succeeded in manually orchestrating the publicly available Gemini 3 Deep Think model to solve Problem 10, as described in Appendix C.7. 3.2. Evaluations To evaluate our outputs, we obtained independent feedback from at least two academic mathematicians (some of whom were partially affiliated with Google) for each problem. When the experts felt less confident, we solicited more opinions from academic mathematicians. Table 2 summarizes our assessments. problem-by-problem description is given below. P2. Three out of three experts agreed that both solutions were Correct. 4This was our motivation for building Aletheia, and indeed the origin of the name. 5 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously P5. Experts pointed out that there was ambiguity in the formulation of the question. Three of three experts agreed that Aletheia As is Correct. Aletheia interpreted the slice filtration in an archaic way that differs from its modern usage. Because of this, reviewers classified Aletheia Bs solution as Misinterpretation of the problem, and did not further vet it for mathematical correctness. P7. Three out of three experts agreed that Aletheia Bs solution is Correct. Aletheia As solution is Critically Flawed. It contains two arguments, both of which boil down to the claim that if 𝜎 is an order 2 automorphism acting freely on manifold 𝑀, then the (compactly supported) rational Euler characteristic of 𝑀 is divisible by 2. The attempted justification invokes multiplicativity of (compactly supported) rational Euler characteristic, but this is not justified without appropriate finiteness assumptions on 𝑀; this fallacy is noted in the official problem comments. P8. Experts deemed Aletheia As solution to P8 to be Inadequate. For Aletheia Bs solution to P8, three out of three external specialists in symplectic geometry judged it to be correct prior to the February 13 deadline. An internal mathematician expressed reservations, so we solicited more assessments, ultimately obtaining opinions from four specialists in symplectic geometry and three additional mathematicians with adjacent expertise. In total, three specialists and two adjacent mathematicians considered the solution to be Correct. representative quote from this group was, Overall, while wouldnt say this solution is perfect, think its reasonable to count it as correct proof. The remaining specialist and adjacent mathematician considered the proof to be incomplete due to the level of detail. representative quote from this group was, The shakiest part is indeed in the interpolation step when the local smoothings at the vertices of the polyhedral Lagrangian surface need to be extended to smoothings along the edges. think it is fair to object that more detail is needed at this step, and this is true for the proof attempts provided by both agents. Upon examining the expert evaluations, we realized that all were essentially in agreement on the mathematical content, and the ambiguity came from subjective interpretation of the meaning of being publishable after minor revisions, within the established range of the peer review process. None of the experts expressed that there were errors in the argument, but most experts voiced that parts of Steps 3 and 4 were vague or sketchy (see 3.2), and that the solution as whole was not publishable without revisions. P9. Four out of four experts agreed that Aletheia As solutions are correct. Two out of two experts agreed that Aletheia Bs solutions are correct. P10. Two out of two experts agreed that both Aletheia As and Aletheia Bs solutions are correct. 3.3. Further comparisons Aletheia and Aletheia each produced candidate solutions for the same six problems. Each agent individually had at least one false positive, but their best-of-2 performance produced credible solutions to all six problems. This outcome shows promising increase in accuracy over the December 2025 version of Aletheia used for the Erdős problems in (Feng et al., 2026a). Compared to that version, Aletheia and Aletheia featured improvements to both the agentic scaffolding and the base models. In addition to Aletheia, an independent evaluation of the publicly available Gemini 3 Deep Think model highlighted its strong capabilities. While not strictly autonomousrelying on two humans to sample and concatenate the best outputs this effort produced solution to Problem 10 that matches the optimal theoretical complexity bound also discovered autonomously by Aletheia A, but with much less inference scaling; see Appendix C.7. 6 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously 4.

ISBN 978-1-107-14259-6. A. Verification and Extraction Prompt Below we display the verification and extraction prompt used on Aletheias outputs, which were run through Gemini 3 Deep Think. This prompt was designed elicit output of the quality and format requested by the FirstProof authors. In particular, it allowed us to obtain LATEX code directly as output, ensuring that manual intervention would not be required even for reformatting the response in LATEX document. 7 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Running this prompt filtered out P3 submission from Aletheia with verdict [WRONG]. [FIXABLE] verdict was returned on P5 and P7 from Aletheia A, and our logs display the (autonomously) revised outputs. Other outputs listed above were marked [CORRECT] by the extraction prompt, and no changes were made to produce the final output. You are an expert peer reviewer for top-tier academic journal. Your task is to rigorously evaluate problem and its candidate solution. If you find correct solution, output it as latex document that conforms to the levels of rigor and scholarship prevailing in the mathematics literature. Please approach the evaluation using the following structured process: **1. Independent Verification** Before evaluating the candidate, use your reasoning process to independently analyze the <problem> to determine the correct methodology and potential edge cases. Then, do line-by-line verification of the < candidate_solution>. Actively search for logical fallacies, unstated assumptions, calculation errors, or lack of rigor. After your reasoning process, format your final response exactly as follows: ### 1. Critique Provide concise summary of your analysis. Point out any specific flaws, leaps in logic, or informalities found in the candidate solution. The solution needs to conform to the levels of rigor and scholarship prevailing in the mathematics literature. If the solution cites the literature, carefully check that all citations include precise statement numbers and should either be to articles published in peerreviewed journals or to arXiv preprints. ### 2. Verdict Based on your critique, declare exactly ONE of the following verdicts in bold: - **[CORRECT]**: The solution is flawless, completely rigorous, and requires no changes. - **[WRONG]**: The solution is fundamentally flawed, relies on invalid logic, or cannot be salvaged without complete rewrite of the core approach. - **[FIXABLE]**: The core approach is sound, but it contains minor errors, skips necessary steps, or lacks formal academic rigor. ### 3. Resolution Execute the corresponding action based on your verdict: - If **[CORRECT]**: Briefly state why the solution meets publication standards. - If **[WRONG]**: Explicitly detail the fatal flaw in the approach and mathematically/logically explain why it fails. (Do not write new solution from scratch). - If **[FIXABLE]**: Generate **complete, corrected version** of the solution from start to finish. Do not merely list the fixes. The revision must be cohesive, standalone proof/solution written at level of completeness, clarity, and rigor suitable for peer-reviewed journal publication, conforming to the levels of rigor and scholarship prevailing in the mathematics literature. If the solution cites the literature, carefully check that all citations include precise statement numbers and should either be to articles published in peerreviewed journals or to arXiv preprints. 8 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously <problem> [INSERT PROBLEM HERE] </problem> <candidate_solution> [INSERT CANDIDATE SOLUTION HERE] </candidate_solution> B. Pre-deadline evaluations This Appendix records the best-of-2 submission for each problem that was sent to the FirstProof authors on February 13, 2026. Originally, we ran another agent called Aletheia Af, variant setting of Aletheia that overrode the natural orchestration to force greater inference expenditure during generation. Aletheia Af was aborted shortly after producing solutions to P2 and P9 to save inference cost. To preserve the best-of-2 nature of our attempt, we did not run P2, P9 (or P5) on Aletheia until the evening of February 13, at which point we ran Aletheia on those problems for future ablation purposes only (without reading the output). Table 3 is reproduced exactly from the February 13 e-mail sent to the FirstProof authors. It displays the internal evaluations of the solutions as of Friday 13, 2026, and first choice submission for each problem. The accuracy of these evaluations is superseded by Table 2, which is based on more careful evaluations with wider nets of experts; we include Table 3 only for historical reasons. Note, however, that the best-of-2 results from Table 3 and the best-of-2 results from Table 2 both result align with Table 1. We discuss the differences between Table 3 and Table 2. P2. Aletheia Bs submission for P2, left unread before February 14, was later found to be Correct. P5. Aletheia Bs submission for P5, left unread before February 14, was later found to be based on Misinterpretation of the question. P7. We were initially unable to validate Aletheia Bs solution to P7 due to its late appearance, as well as limited internal expertise. Based on prior experience with solutions of such complexity, we conservatively guessed that it was Incorrect. Later, upon closer examination, we realized that Aletheia Bs solution to P7 was in fact Correct. P8. Prior to February 13, three out of three experts deemed Aletheia As submission for P8 to be Correct (based on quick appraisals). Upon closer examination, at least one expert commented that it is sketchy in some important places (I think its fair to say there are some gaps, arguably errors), so does not reach the typical standard of correct proof . Another expert said actually, maybe [Aletheia As solution] is bit short of correct, but think it is not far off . We therefore changed the verdict to Inadequate in Table 2. P9. Aletheia Bs solution to P9, left unread before February 14, was later found to be Correct. P10. Aletheia As solution to P10 was labeled Incorrect in Table 3. This turned out to be miscommunication from one expert to the lead author, and after reassessment experts were unanimous that the original solution was correct. In fact, they considered it to be more optimal than Aletheia Bs solution, as Aletheia autonomously derived precomputation step that removes the 𝑂(𝑞) dependency from the iterative PCG loop. While we present Aletheia Bs solution in Appendix C.6 as it was our initial first choice submission, the full Aletheia solution is available online here.

Raw prompts and outputs For each FirstProof problem answered by at least one of our two agents, we display the raw prompt and first choice output, according to our original evaluation in Table 3, which was as sent to the FirstProof authors prior to the deadline. We also include remarks with selected expert commentary. 10 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously C.1. Problem 2 FirstProof # 2 Let 𝐹 be non-archimedean local field with ring of integers 𝔬. Let 𝑁𝑟 denote the subgroup of GL𝑟 (𝐹) consisting of upper-triangular unipotent elements. Let 𝜓 : 𝐹 ℂ be nontrivial additive character of conductor 𝔬, identified in the standard way with generic character of 𝑁𝑟. Let Π be generic irreducible admissible representation of GL𝑛+1(𝐹), realized in its 𝜓1Whittaker model (Π, 𝜓1). Must there exist 𝑊 (Π, 𝜓1) with the following property? Let 𝜋 be generic irreducible admissible representation of GL𝑛(𝐹), realized in its 𝜓-Whittaker model (𝜋, 𝜓). Let 𝔮 denote the conductor ideal of 𝜋, let 𝑄 𝐹 be generator of 𝔮1, and set 𝑢𝑄 := 𝐼𝑛+1 + 𝑄 𝐸𝑛,𝑛+1 GL𝑛+1(𝐹), where 𝐸𝑖, 𝑗 is the matrix with 1 in the (𝑖, 𝑗)-entry and 0 elsewhere. For some 𝑉 (𝜋, 𝜓), the local RankinSelberg integral 𝑁𝑛GL𝑛 (𝐹) 𝑊 (diag(𝑔, 1)𝑢𝑄) 𝑉 (𝑔) det 𝑔𝑠 1 2 𝑑𝑔 is finite and nonzero for all 𝑠 ℂ. Model Response (Agent A) Introduction Let 𝐹 be non-archimedean local field with ring of integers 𝔬 and maximal ideal 𝔭. We fix uniformizer 𝜛 𝔭 and let 𝑞 = 𝔬/𝔭. Let 𝑁𝑟 denote the subgroup of GL𝑟 (𝐹) consisting of upper-triangular unipotent elements, and let 𝐾𝑟 = GL𝑟 (𝔬) denote the standard maximal compact subgroup. Let 𝜓 : 𝐹 ℂ be fixed nontrivial additive character of conductor 𝔬. Theorem 1. Let Π be generic irreducible admissible representation of GL𝑛+1(𝐹). There exists 𝑊 (Π, 𝜓1) such that for any generic irreducible admissible representation 𝜋 of GL𝑛(𝐹) with conductor ideal 𝔮, and any generator 𝑄 𝐹 of 𝔮1, there exists 𝑉 (𝜋, 𝜓) such that the local RankinSelberg integral 𝑍(𝑠, 𝑊, 𝑉) = 𝑁𝑛GL𝑛 (𝐹) 𝑊 (diag(𝑔, 1)𝑢𝑄) 𝑉 (𝑔) det 𝑔𝑠 1 2 𝑑𝑔 is finite and nonzero for all 𝑠 ℂ, where 𝑢𝑄 = 𝐼𝑛+1 + 𝑄 𝐸𝑛,𝑛+1. Proof. Step 1: GelfandKazhdan restriction and 𝑠-independence. We evaluate the right translation of 𝑊 by 𝑢𝑄. Block matrix multiplication yields diag(𝑔, 1)𝑢𝑄 = 𝑈𝑄 diag(𝑔, 1), where 𝑈𝑄 = 𝐼𝑛+1 + 𝑄 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑔𝑖,𝑛𝐸𝑖,𝑛+1. Because 𝑈𝑄 𝑁𝑛+1 and its only superdiagonal entry (i.e., immediately above the main diagonal) is located at (𝑛, 𝑛 + 1) with value 𝑄𝑔𝑛,𝑛, the left 𝑁𝑛+1-equivariance of the Whittaker model (Π, 𝜓1) entails 𝑊 (diag(𝑔, 1)𝑢𝑄) = 𝜓1(𝑄𝑔𝑛,𝑛)𝑊 (diag(𝑔, 1)) = 𝜓(𝑄𝑔𝑛,𝑛)𝑊 (diag(𝑔, 1)). 11 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously By the GelfandKazhdan restriction theory for the Kirillov model (H. Jacquet, I. I. PiatetskiShapiro, and J. A. Shalika, RankinSelberg Convolutions, 1983), the restriction map 𝑐 (𝑁𝑛GL𝑛(𝐹), 𝜓1). 𝑊 𝑊 GL𝑛 (𝐹) surjects onto space of functions containing 𝑐 (𝑁𝑛GL𝑛(𝐹), 𝜓1) supported precisely on the We define smooth cut-off function Φ open and closed double coset 𝑁𝑛 𝐾𝑛 by setting Φ(𝑛𝑘) = 𝜓1(𝑛) for 𝑛 𝑁𝑛 and 𝑘 𝐾𝑛, and extending it by zero elsewhere. This is well-defined because 𝜓 is trivial on the intersection 𝑁𝑛 𝐾𝑛 = 𝑁𝑛 GL𝑛(𝔬). We fix choice of 𝑊 (Π, 𝜓1) satisfying 𝑊 (diag(𝑔, 1)) = Φ(𝑔). Substituting this test vector 𝑊 restricts the domain of integration strictly to the compact quotient 𝑁𝑛𝑁𝑛 𝐾𝑛 (𝑁𝑛 𝐾𝑛)𝐾𝑛. For 𝑘 𝐾𝑛, we have det 𝑘 = 1, which completely eliminates the complex parameter 𝑠. Normalizing the quotient measure appropriately, the integral converges absolutely to finite, 𝑠-independent functional: 𝐿𝑄 (𝑉) = 𝐾𝑛 𝜓(𝑄𝑘𝑛,𝑛)𝑉 (𝑘) 𝑑𝑘. We are reduced to showing that there exists 𝑉 (𝜋, 𝜓) such that 𝐿𝑄 (𝑉) 0. Step 2: The unramified case (𝑐 = 0). If 𝜋 is unramified, its conductor ideal is 𝔮 = 𝔬, meaning 𝑄 𝔬. We evaluate the functional on the normalized spherical vector 𝑉 = 𝑉0, which satisfies 𝑉0(𝑘) = 1 for all 𝑘 𝐾𝑛. Since 𝑘𝑛,𝑛 𝔬 and 𝑄 𝔬, we have 𝑄𝑘𝑛,𝑛 𝔬. Because the additive character 𝜓 has conductor 𝔬, it follows that 𝜓(𝑄𝑘𝑛,𝑛) = 1. The functional thus yields 𝐿𝑄 (𝑉0) = vol(𝐾𝑛) > 0. Step 3: Finite Fourier analysis setup (𝑐 1). Assume 𝜋 has conductor 𝔮 = 𝔭𝑐 with 𝑐 1. Here, 𝑄 = 𝛼𝜛𝑐 for some unit 𝛼 𝔬. Let 𝑉0 (𝜋, 𝜓) be the essential newform, properly normalized so that 𝑉0(𝐼𝑛) = 1. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that 𝐿𝑄 (𝜋(ℎ1)𝑉0) = 0 for all ℎ 𝐾𝑛. Evaluating the functional and making the change of variables 𝑘 𝑘ℎ yields: 𝐾𝑛 𝜓(𝑄(𝑘ℎ)𝑛,𝑛)𝑉0(𝑘) 𝑑𝑘 = 0 for all ℎ 𝐾𝑛. 𝑛 = (𝑒𝑛𝑘) 𝑦, where 𝑛 is column vector. As ℎ traverses 𝐾𝑛, the vector 𝑦 traverses all unimodular column Let 𝑒𝑛 = (0, . . . , 0, 1) be viewed as row vector in 𝔬𝑛. Then (𝑘ℎ)𝑛,𝑛 = 𝑒𝑛𝑘ℎ𝑒𝑇 𝑦 = ℎ𝑒𝑇 vectors in 𝔬𝑛. Because 𝑄 = 𝛼𝜛𝑐, the value 𝜓(𝑄(𝑒𝑛𝑘) 𝑦) depends on the row vector 𝑒𝑛𝑘 exclusively modulo 𝔭𝑐. We descend to the finite quotient module 𝐺 = (𝔬/𝔭𝑐)𝑛 by defining function 𝐻 : 𝐺 ℂ as follows: 𝐻 (𝜂) = {𝑘 𝐾𝑛:𝑒𝑛𝑘𝜂 (mod 𝔭𝑐 ) } 𝑉0(𝑘) 𝑑𝑘. If 𝜂 does not lift to unimodular vector in 𝔬𝑛, the domain of integration is empty, forcing 𝐻 (𝜂) = 0. The vanishing assumption dictates that the finite Fourier transform of 𝐻 is identically zero on all unimodular vectors 𝑦 𝐺: (cid:98)𝐻 ( 𝑦) = 𝜂𝐺 𝐻 (𝜂)𝜓(𝑄𝜂 𝑦) = 0. Step 4: Fourier inversion and translation invariance. Since (cid:98)𝐻 ( 𝑦) = 0 for all unimodular 𝑦, the support of (cid:98)𝐻 is restricted to non-unimodular vectors. Over the finite module 𝐺, vector is non-unimodular if and only if all its entries belong to 𝔭/𝔭𝑐, meaning (cid:98)𝐻 is supported entirely on 𝔭𝐺. 12 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Applying the Fourier inversion formula over 𝐺, we obtain: 𝐻 (𝜂) = 1 𝐺 𝑦 𝔭𝐺 (cid:98)𝐻 ( 𝑦)𝜓(𝑄𝜂 𝑦). Let 𝑦 𝔭𝐺, guaranteeing 𝑦 = 𝜛𝑧 for some column vector 𝑧 (𝔬/𝔭𝑐1)𝑛. For an arbitrary shift 𝛿 𝔭𝑐1𝐺, we may write 𝛿 = 𝜛𝑐1𝑥 with row vector 𝑥 𝐺. The inner product computes as: 𝑄𝛿𝑦 = (𝛼𝜛𝑐)(𝜛𝑐1𝑥)(𝜛𝑧) = 𝛼𝑥𝑧 𝔬. Because the additive character 𝜓 has conductor 𝔬, we deduce 𝜓(𝑄𝛿𝑦) = 𝜓(𝛼𝑥𝑧) = 1. The additive character thus neutralizes the shift, giving 𝜓(𝑄(𝜂 + 𝛿) 𝑦) = 𝜓(𝑄𝜂 𝑦). Consequently, 𝐻 (𝜂) exhibits translation invariance: 𝐻 (𝜂 + 𝛿) = 𝐻 (𝜂) for all 𝛿 𝔭𝑐1𝐺. Step 5: Level lowering and contradiction. We evaluate 𝐻 (𝑒𝑛). The domain of integration enforces the condition 𝑒𝑛𝑘 𝑒𝑛 (mod 𝔭𝑐), which strictly characterizes the mirabolic congruence subgroup 𝐾1(𝔭𝑐) consisting of matrices in 𝐾𝑛 whose last row is congruent to 𝑒𝑛 modulo 𝔭𝑐. By foundational theory (H. Jacquet, I. I. PiatetskiShapiro, and J. A. Shalika, Conducteur des représentations du groupe linéaire, 1981), the essential newform 𝑉0 is invariant under right translation by 𝐾1(𝔭𝑐). Since 𝑉0(𝐼𝑛) = 1, we obtain: 𝐻 (𝑒𝑛) = 𝐾1 (𝔭𝑐 ) 𝑉0(𝑘) 𝑑𝑘 = vol(𝐾1(𝔭𝑐)) > 0. By the translation invariance established above, summing 𝐻 over the 𝑞𝑛 mutually distinct shifts 𝛿 𝔭𝑐1𝐺 yields: 𝐻 (𝑒𝑛 + 𝛿) = 𝑞𝑛 𝐻 (𝑒𝑛) > 0. 𝛿𝔭𝑐1𝐺 Conversely, returning to the definition of 𝐻, the disjoint union of the integration domains {𝑘 𝐾𝑛 : 𝑒𝑛𝑘 𝑒𝑛 + 𝛿 (mod 𝔭𝑐)} systematically aggregates to the coarser condition 𝑒𝑛𝑘 𝑒𝑛 (mod 𝔭𝑐1). This aggregated domain precisely identifies the broader mirabolic congruence subgroup 𝐾1(𝔭𝑐1). Therefore: 𝛿𝔭𝑐1𝐺 𝐻 (𝑒𝑛 + 𝛿) = 𝐾1 (𝔭𝑐1 ) 𝑉0(𝑘) 𝑑𝑘. This integral calculates the evaluation at 𝐼𝑛 of the locally averaged vector 𝑣 = 𝐾1 (𝔭𝑐1 ) 𝜋(𝑘)𝑉0 𝑑𝑘 (𝜋, 𝜓). Because the conductor of 𝜋 is exactly 𝔭𝑐, the representation 𝜋 contains no nonzero vectors invariant under the larger mirabolic congruence subgroup 𝐾1(𝔭𝑐1). Thus, the vector 𝑣 identically vanishes, mandating 𝑣(𝐼𝑛) = 0. We are thereby led to the contradiction 0 = 𝑞𝑛 vol(𝐾1(𝔭𝑐)) > 0. This contradiction demonstrates that the uniform vanishing hypothesis must be false. We conclude that there exists some translate 𝑉 = 𝜋(ℎ1)𝑉0 for which the local RankinSelberg integral is finite and nonzero, completing the proof. 13 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Remark C.1.

Problem 5 FirstProof # 5 Fix finite group 𝐺. Let denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an 𝑁 operad. Define the slice filtration on the 𝐺-equivariant stable category adapted to and state and prove characterization of the O-slice connectivity of connective 𝐺-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points. Model Response (Agent A) Setup and Structural Invariants In equivariant stable homotopy theory, commutative ring spectra can be parameterized by 𝑁 operads, which specify the sets of admissible norm maps. By the foundational work of Blumberg and Hill (2, Section 4), and its subsequent combinatorial classification by Rubin (5, Theorem 3.7) via indexing systems, the data of an 𝑁 operad on finite group 𝐺 can be equivalently captured by partial order formalism known as an incomplete transfer system. This formulation was explicitly introduced and formalized by Balchin, Barnes, and Roitzheim (1, Definition 2.4). Definition 2 (Balchin, Barnes, and Roitzheim (1, Definition 2.4)). transfer system on finite group 𝐺 is partial order on the set of subgroups of 𝐺 that refines inclusion and satisfies two axioms: 1. Conjugation: 𝐾 𝐻 = 𝑔𝐾𝑔1 𝑔𝐻𝑔1 for all 𝑔 𝐺. 2. Restriction: If 𝐾 𝐻 and 𝐽 𝐻, then 𝐾 𝐽 𝐽. Because the set of subgroups {𝐾 𝐻 𝐾 𝐻} is finite and closed under intersection (via the restriction axiom and the transitivity of the partial order), it possesses unique minimal element, which we denote by 𝐻O. This allows us to define natural index for subgroups adapted to the operad. Definition 3. The O-index of subgroup 𝐽 𝐺 is defined as the maximal index of an Oadmissible subgroup of 𝐽, which evaluates to: 𝐽 := [𝐽 : 𝐽O]. Definition 4. finite 𝐻-set 𝑇 is O-admissible if the stabilizer of every point 𝑡 𝑇 is an Oadmissible subgroup of 𝐻 (i.e., Stab𝐻 (𝑡) 𝐻). permutation representation is O-admissible if it is isomorphic to ℝ[𝑇] for an O-admissible 𝐻-set 𝑇. Let 𝑅𝑂+ ( 𝐻) denote the monoid of isomorphism classes of O-admissible permutation representations of 𝐻. We adapt the regular slice filtration (cf. Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel (3, Section 4.1); Hill and Yarnall (4, Section 2)) to the incomplete transfer system as follows: 14 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Definition 5. For an integer 𝑛 0, the O-slice category Σ 𝑛 is the full subcategory of connective genuine 𝐺-spectra generated (under arbitrary wedges, extensions, and homotopy colimits) by the O-slice cells: (cid:8)𝐺+ 𝐻 𝑆𝑉 (cid:12) (cid:12) 𝐻 𝐺, 𝑉 𝑅𝑂+ ( 𝐻), and dimℝ(𝑉) 𝑛(cid:9) ."

For any 𝐻 𝐺, 𝑉 𝑅𝑂+ ( 𝐻), and 𝐽 𝐻, the dimension of the 𝐽-fixed points satisfies dim(𝑉 𝐽) dim(𝑉) 𝐽 . Proof. By additivity over disjoint unions of 𝐻-orbits, it suffices to prove this for transitive admissible representations 𝑉 = ℝ[𝐻/𝐾] where 𝐾 𝐻. The dimension dim(𝑉 𝐽) is precisely the number of 𝐽-orbits on the coset space 𝐻/𝐾, which corresponds to the number of double cosets 𝐽𝐻/𝐾. Consider generic orbit corresponding to the double coset 𝐽𝑥 𝐾. The stabilizer in 𝐽 of the coset 𝑥 𝐾 𝐻/𝐾 is 𝐿 = 𝐽 𝑥 𝐾𝑥 1. By the conjugation axiom, 𝑥 𝐾𝑥 1 𝑥 𝐻𝑥 1 = 𝐻. By the restriction axiom applied to 𝐽 𝐻, we obtain 𝐿 𝐽. Because 𝐿 is O-admissible in 𝐽, its index satisfies [𝐽 : 𝐿] [𝐽 : 𝐽O] = 𝐽 O. The size of this generic 𝐽-orbit on 𝐻/𝐾 is [𝐽 : 𝐿], which is bounded above by 𝐽 O. Partitioning the elements of 𝐻/𝐾 into these orbits yields: dim(𝑉) = [𝐻 : 𝐾] = [𝐽 : 𝐿] orbits orbits 𝐽 = dim(𝑉 𝐽) 𝐽 . Dividing by 𝐽 yields the desired inequality. Proof of Necessity 𝑛. Since the geometric fixed point functor Φ𝐽 is exact and preserves arbitrary Assume 𝑋 Σ wedges and homotopy colimits, it suffices to verify the connectivity condition on the generators 𝑌 = 𝐺+ 𝐻 𝑆𝑉 with dimℝ(𝑉) 𝑛. By the geometric double coset Mackey formula: Φ𝐽 (𝑌 ) Φ𝐽 (𝐺+ 𝐻 𝑆𝑉) (cid:220) 𝑆 (𝑥𝑉 ) 𝐽 . 𝑥 𝐽𝐺/𝐻, 𝐽 𝑥 𝐻𝑥 1 15 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously . By Lemma 1, we have dim(𝑉 𝐽) dim(𝑉)/ 𝐽 O. For each double coset 𝑥 contributing to the wedge, define 𝐽 = 𝑥 1 𝐽𝑥 𝐻. The space (𝑥𝑉) 𝐽 is naturally isomorphic to 𝑉 𝐽 Because the transfer system is conjugation-invariant, conjugation by 𝑥 induces poset isomorphism between the O-admissible subgroups of 𝐽 and those of 𝐽, giving 𝐽 = 𝐽 O. Thus, dim(𝑉 𝐽) 𝑛/ 𝐽 O. Because dimensions of real representations are integers, we obtain the bound dim(𝑉 𝐽) 𝑛/ 𝐽 O. Therefore, Φ𝐽 (𝑌 ) is wedge of non-equivariant spheres of dimension at least 𝑛/ 𝐽 O, implying Φ𝐽 (𝑌 ) Sp 𝑛/ 𝐽 . Because the subcategory Sp 𝑛/ 𝐽 is closed under wedges, extensions, and homotopy colimits, and Φ𝐽 preserves these operations, this connectivity bound necessarily extends from the generators 𝑌 to the generic spectrum 𝑋. This completes the proof of necessity. Proof of Sufficiency We proceed by strong induction on the order of 𝐺. The base case 𝐺 = {𝑒} is trivial. Assume the theorem holds for all proper subgroups of 𝐺. Let 𝑋 be 𝐺-spectrum satisfying the fixed-point bounds for all 𝐽 𝐺. Let denote the family of proper subgroups of 𝐺. Consider the 𝐺-isotropy separation cofiber sequence: 𝐸P+ 𝑋 𝑋 𝐸P 𝑋 . Since the subcategory Σ belong to Σ 𝑛. 𝑛 is closed under extensions, it suffices to show that both outer terms + 𝐸P (𝑘) Step 1: The term 𝐸P+ 𝑋 The classifying space 𝐸P is 𝐺-CW complex, and thus 𝐸P+ is equipped with skeletal filtration where the cofibers of the successive skeletal inclusions 𝐸P (𝑘1) + are finite wedges of cells of the form (𝐺/𝐻)+ 𝑆𝑘 for proper subgroups 𝐻 and 𝑘 0. Smashing this filtration with 𝑋, we deduce that 𝐸P+ 𝑋 is built via wedges, extensions, and homotopy colimits from spectra of the form (𝐺/𝐻)+ 𝑆𝑘 𝑋 Σ𝑘 (𝐺+ 𝐻 𝑖 𝐻 𝑋). Because Σ 𝑛 is closed under homotopy colimits, it is closed under suspensions (as Σ𝑍 is the homotopy colimit of 𝑍 ). Establishing that the 𝑛 is strictly sufficient to guarantee that 𝐸P+ 𝑋 Σ unsuspended spectrum 𝐺+ 𝐻 𝑖 𝑛. For any proper subgroup 𝐻 < 𝐺, let O𝐻 denote the transfer system restricted to subgroups of 𝐻. For any 𝐽 𝐻, we note Φ𝐽 (𝑖 𝐻 𝑋) Φ𝐽 (𝑋). By hypothesis, this spectrum is 𝑛/ 𝐽 O-connective. Because the minimal admissible subgroups in O𝐻 structurally coincide with those in O, we have 𝐽 O𝐻 = 𝐽 O. Thus, 𝑖 𝐻 𝑋 perfectly satisfies the connectivity hypothesis for O𝐻. By the inductive 𝐻 𝑋 Σ O𝐻 hypothesis, 𝑖 𝑛 . The exact induction functor 𝐺+ 𝐻 () sends O𝐻-admissible cells identically to O-admissible cells. Specifically, for any 𝐾 𝐻 and any O𝐻-admissible representation 𝑊 of 𝐾, we have 𝐺+ 𝐻 ( 𝐻+ 𝐾 𝑆𝑊) 𝐺+ 𝐾 𝑆𝑊. Because 𝑊 is O𝐻-admissible, its stabilizers are O𝐻-admissible in 𝐾, which natively implies they are O-admissible. Therefore, 𝐺+ 𝐻 𝑖 𝑛, which guarantees 𝐸P+ 𝑋 Σ 𝐻 𝑋 Σ 𝐻 𝑋 Σ 𝑛. Step 2: The term 𝐸P 𝑋 By standard geometric localization (see, e.g., (4, Lemma 2.2) or (3, Section 2.5)), 𝐸P 𝑋 is geometric 𝐺-spectrum naturally determined by its geometric 𝐺-fixed points, yielding the equivalence 𝐸P 𝑋 𝐸P infl(Φ𝐺 𝑋), where infl denotes inflation from non-equivariant spectra. By hypothesis, Φ𝐺 𝑋 Sp𝑚, where 𝑚 = 𝑛/𝐺 O. Consequently, Φ𝐺 𝑋 is generated (under wedges, extensions, and homotopy colimits) by non-equivariant spheres 𝑆𝑘 for 𝑘 𝑚. Because 16 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously these operations commute with inflation and smashing with 𝐸P, it suffices to prove that 𝐸P infl(𝑆𝑘) 𝐸P 𝑆𝑘 Σ Consider the regular admissible permutation representation 𝑉 = 𝑘ℝ[𝐺/𝐺 O]. Its dimension is 𝑘[𝐺 : 𝐺 O] = 𝑘𝐺 𝑚𝐺 𝑛. Consequently, the representation sphere 𝑆𝑉 Σ We apply the isotropy separation sequence to 𝑆𝑉: 𝑛 for all integers 𝑘 𝑚. 𝑛. 𝐸P+ 𝑆𝑉 𝑆𝑉 𝐸P 𝑆𝑉 . Observe that for any 𝐽 𝐺, Φ𝐽 (𝑆𝑉) 𝑆𝑉 𝐽 . By Lemma 1, for any proper subgroup 𝐽 < 𝐺, we have dim(𝑉 𝐽) dim(𝑉)/ 𝐽 𝑛/ 𝐽 O. Thus, 𝑆𝑉 perfectly satisfies the geometric fixed point bounds for all proper subgroups. Applying the exact same induction logic established in Step 1 to the spectrum 𝑌 = 𝑆𝑉, we deduce that 𝑖 𝑛 via the inductive hypothesis, ensuring 𝐸P+ 𝑆𝑉 Σ 𝑛 is closed under homotopy colimits (and thus cofibers), we deduce from the sequence that 𝐸P 𝑆𝑉 Σ 𝑛. Finally, we identify the 𝐺-fixed points 𝑉𝐺. Because 𝐺 acts transitively on the single orbit 𝐺/𝐺 O, the 𝐺-fixed point subspace (the trivial subrepresentation) of ℝ[𝐺/𝐺 O] is 1-dimensional. Thus, dim(𝑉𝐺) = 𝑘 1 = 𝑘. Passing to the 𝐸P-localization evaluates exactly to these fixed points: 𝑛. As the subcategory Σ 𝐻𝑆𝑉 Σ O𝐻 𝐸P 𝑆𝑉 𝐸P infl(Φ𝐺𝑆𝑉) 𝐸P 𝑆𝑉𝐺 𝐸P 𝑆𝑘.

Problem 7 FirstProof # 7 Suppose that Γ is uniform lattice in real semi-simple group, and that Γ contains some 2-torsion. Is it possible for Γ to be the fundamental group of compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is acyclic over the rational numbers ℚ? Model Response (Agent B) Theorem. Let 𝐺 be real semi-simple Lie group, and let Γ 𝐺 be uniform lattice containing an element of order 2. Then Γ cannot be the fundamental group of compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is acyclic over the rational numbers ℚ. Proof. The proof proceeds by contradiction. Assume there exists compact, boundaryless manifold 𝑀 with fundamental group 𝜋1(𝑀) (cid:27) Γ whose universal cover 𝑀 is rationally acyclic. Let 𝐾 be maximal compact subgroup of 𝐺, and let 𝑋 = 𝐺/𝐾 be the associated symmetric space. As symmetric space of non-compact type, 𝑋 is contractible, proper CAT(0) metric space. Let 𝑑 = dim 𝑋. By hypothesis, Γ contains an element 𝛾 of order 2. Step 1: Topological Setup and Equivariant Classifying Map By Selbergs Lemma, the finitely generated linear group Γ contains torsion-free normal subgroup of finite index, say Γ1. To ensure orientability and connectedness, we refine this subgroup. Let 𝐺0 be the connected identity component of 𝐺. Let Γ+ 𝑋 Γ be the subgroup acting by orientation-preserving isometries on 𝑋, and let Γ+ 𝑀 Γ be the subgroup acting by orientation-preserving deck transformations on 𝑀. Because orientations admit exactly two states, these subgroups have index at most 2 in Γ. We define Γ0 = Γ1 𝐺0 Γ+ 𝑋 Γ+ 𝑀 . As finite intersection of finite-index normal subgroups, Γ0 is torsion-free normal subgroup of Γ of finite index. Crucially, Γ0 𝐺0, and it acts freely and orientation-preservingly on both 𝑀 and 𝑋. The quotient spaces 𝑀0 = 𝑀/Γ0 and 𝑋0 = 𝑋/Γ0 are closed, orientable manifolds. Because 𝑋 is contractible and the Γ0-action is free and cocompact, 𝑋0 natively serves as compact EilenbergMacLane classifying space 𝐵Γ0. To rigorously construct classifying map that is strictly pointwise equivariant, we apply Bredon equivariant obstruction theory on the universal covers. The full group Γ acts strictly freely on 𝑀 via deck transformations, making 𝑀 free Γ-CW complex. Furthermore, 𝑋 is contractible proper Γ-space. The geometric obstructions to constructing Γ-equivariant map reside in the Bredon equivariant cohomology groups 𝐻 𝑘 Γ ( 𝑀; 𝜋𝑘1(𝑋)). Since 𝑋 is contractible, 𝜋𝑘1(𝑋) = 0 for all 𝑘 1, meaning all obstructions identically vanish. Thus, there exists strictly Γ-equivariant continuous map 𝑓 : 𝑀 𝑋. Descending this map to the Γ0-quotients yields canonical classifying map 𝑓0 : 𝑀0 𝑋0, which is strictly Γ/Γ0-equivariant by geometric construction. Because both 𝑀 and 𝑋 are ℚ-acyclic, the CartanLeray spectral sequence collapses, guaranteeing that 𝑓0 induces an isomorphism on rational homology. Consequently, dim 𝑀0 = dim 𝑋0 = 𝑑, and its proper topological mapping degree 𝐷 = deg( 𝑓0) is strictly non-zero integer. Because Γ0 is normal subgroup, the order-2 element 𝛾 Γ0 projects to non-trivial involution 𝛾 Γ/Γ0 acting on both 𝑀0 and 𝑋0. Let 𝜖𝑀, 𝜖𝑋 {1} denote the orientation parity of 𝛾 on 𝑀0 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously and 𝑋0, respectively. Because 𝑓0 is strictly ℤ/2-equivariant with respect to 𝛾 (i.e., 𝑓0 𝛾 = 𝛾 𝑓0), evaluating the induced homology maps on the fundamental class [𝑀0] 𝐻𝑑 (𝑀0; ℤ) yields: 𝑓0(𝛾 [𝑀0]) = 𝑓0(𝜖𝑀 [𝑀0]) = 𝜖𝑀 𝐷[𝑋0], 𝛾( 𝑓0 [𝑀0]) = 𝛾(𝐷[𝑋0]) = 𝜖𝑋 𝐷[𝑋0]. This algebraically mandates 𝜖𝑀 𝐷 = 𝜖𝑋 𝐷. Since 𝐷 0, we immediately obtain 𝜖𝑀 = 𝜖𝑋 . Thus, 𝛾 either preserves the orientation of both manifolds or reverses the orientation of both manifolds. Step 2: The Mapping Degree Parity Constraint via AtiyahBorel Localization We now establish that the proper mapping degree 𝐷 must be an even integer. Because 𝑋 is complete CAT(0) metric space, Cartans Fixed-Point Theorem ensures that the finite group 𝛾 fixes point in 𝑋. This equivariance trivially descends to fixed point for the involution 𝛾 on the quotient; thus, the fixed-point set 𝑋 𝛾 0 . Conversely, suppose 𝛾 fixed point [ 𝑦] 𝑀0. The fixed-point relation would natively lift to 𝛾𝑦 = 𝑔0 𝑦 for some 𝑔0 Γ0, where 𝑦 𝑀 represents valid chosen lift of [ 𝑦]. The freeness of the Γ-action on 𝑀 mandates 𝛾 = 𝑔0 Γ0. Since 𝛾 has order 2 and Γ0 is torsion-free, this is mathematically impossible. Thus, 𝑀𝛾 Assume for contradiction that 𝐷 is an odd integer. We evaluate ℤ/2-equivariant Borel cohomology with 𝔽2 coefficients. To maintain orientability of the Borel constructions, we select the dimension 𝑁 of the approximating sphere 𝑆𝑁 based on the orientation parity 𝜖𝑋 : 0 = . If 𝜖𝑋 = 1 (orientation-preserving), we choose 𝑁 to be an odd integer, ensuring the antipodal map on 𝑆𝑁 preserves orientation. If 𝜖𝑋 = 1 (orientation-reversing), we choose 𝑁 to be an even integer, ensuring the antipodal map on 𝑆𝑁 reverses orientation. In both cases, the diagonal ℤ/2-action on the products 𝑀0 𝑆𝑁 and 𝑋0 𝑆𝑁 strictly preserves orientation. Thus, the Borel quotients 𝑀𝑁 = 𝑀0 ℤ/2 𝑆𝑁 and 𝑋𝑁 = 𝑋0 ℤ/2 𝑆𝑁 are strictly closed, orientable manifolds. The equivariant map 𝑓0 induces proper fiber bundle map 𝑓𝑁 : 𝑀𝑁 𝑋𝑁 of degree 𝐷. The ordinary cohomological Gysin transfer unconditionally satisfies ( 𝑓𝑁)! 𝑓 𝑁 (𝑥) = (𝐷 mod 2) 𝑥. Because 𝐷 is odd, 𝐷 1 (mod 2), meaning the composition acts as the identity on 𝐻(𝑋𝑁; 𝔽2). This algebraically forces the pullback 𝑓 Taking the inverse limit as 𝑁 (over the parity-appropriate sequence of spheres), the true equivariant pullback 𝑓 (𝑀0; 𝔽2) is forced to be injective. By the exactness of localization, passing to the localized rings by inverting the polynomial generator 𝑢 𝐻1(𝐵ℤ/2; 𝔽2) preserves this injectivity: 𝑁 to be split injection. (𝑋0; 𝔽2) 𝐻 ℤ/2 : 𝐻 ℤ/2 ℤ/2 𝑆1 𝑓 ℤ/2 : 𝑆1 𝐻 ℤ/2(𝑋0; 𝔽2) 𝑆1 𝐻 ℤ/2(𝑀0; 𝔽2). By the AtiyahBorel Localization Theorem, the localized equivariant cohomology of space is isomorphic to the localized equivariant cohomology of its fixed-point set: 𝑆1 𝐻 ℤ/2(𝑌 ; 𝔽2) (cid:27) 𝐻(𝑌 𝛾; 𝔽2) 𝔽2 𝔽2 [𝑢, 𝑢1]. 0 , the localized domain evaluates to non-zero module. Because 𝑀𝛾 Because 𝑋 𝛾 0 = , the localized target is identically zero. An exact injection from non-zero module into zero module is impossible. Therefore, 𝐷 must rigidly be an even integer. Step 3: Higher Signature Rigidity via the Strong Novikov Conjecture 19 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously 𝑟 (Γ0; ℝ)) to establish fundamentally conflicting constraint. We evaluate the symmetric higher signature of 𝑀0 within the real 𝐶-algebra K-theory 𝐾𝑂𝑑 (𝐶 Because 𝑀 and 𝑋 are ℚ-acyclic, the Universal Coefficient Theorem guarantees they are ℝacyclic. Thus, their real cellular chain complexes 𝐶( 𝑀; ℝ) and 𝐶(𝑋; ℝ) constitute finitelength projective free resolutions of the trivial module ℝ over the real group ring ℝΓ0. By the Fundamental Lemma of Homological Algebra, the chain map 𝐶( 𝑓 ; ℝ) is inherently strict chain homotopy equivalence over ℝΓ0. The algebraic symmetric Poincaré duality structure of 𝑀0 (defined by capping with [𝑀0]) pushes forward under this chain equivalence to capping with 𝑓0 [𝑀0] = 𝐷[𝑋0]. Thus, the algebraic symmetric Poincaré complex defining the higher signature 𝜎(𝑀0) is strictly chain-equivalent to the complex of 𝑋0 globally scaled by 𝐷. Over any real 𝐶-algebra, scaling non-degenerate symmetric Poincaré complex by nonzero real scalar 𝐷 yields complex isomorphic to one scaled merely by its sign. Specifically, we can algebraically conjugate the duality structure with the central, self-adjoint, invertible scalar 𝑐 = 1/𝐷 ℝ. This canonical isomorphism scales the symmetric form by exactly 𝑐 𝑐 𝐷 = 𝑐2 𝐷 = 𝐷/𝐷 = sgn(𝐷). Therefore, the analytic symmetric signatures natively satisfy: 𝜎(𝑀0) = sgn(𝐷)𝜎(𝑋0) 𝐾𝑂𝑑 (𝐶 𝑟 (Γ0; ℝ)). Because Γ0 𝐺0 is discrete uniform lattice in connected Lie group, Kasparovs foundational theorem (G. Kasparov, Equivariant KK-theory and the Novikov conjecture, Inventiones Mathematicae 91 (1988), 147201) establishing the Strong Novikov Conjecture for connected Lie groups guarantees that the rational assembly map (cid:202) 𝜇 : 𝑘 𝐻𝑑4𝑘 (𝐵Γ0; ℚ) 𝐾𝑂𝑑 (𝐶 𝑟 (Γ0; ℝ)) ℚ is injective. The analytic symmetric signature fundamentally corresponds to the assembly of the Poincaré dual of the Hirzebruch 𝐿-class. Explicitly incorporating the functorial pushforward of the homology class via the classifying map 𝑓0, we have: 𝜎(𝑀0) = 𝜇( 𝑓0(𝐿(𝑀0) [𝑀0])) and 𝜎(𝑋0) = 𝜇(𝐿(𝑋0) [𝑋0]). Because the assembly map 𝜇 is rationally injective, the strict equality of K-theoretic signatures forces strict equality of the underlying rationally assembled homology classes in 𝐻(𝑋0; ℚ): 𝑓0(𝐿(𝑀0) [𝑀0]) = sgn(𝐷)(𝐿(𝑋0) [𝑋0]). We evaluate this rigid homological equality strictly at the top topological degree 𝑑. Because the degree-0 component of the Hirzebruch 𝐿-class is identically 𝐿0 = 1 𝐻0(𝑌 ; ℚ), the topdimensional component of the mixed-degree class 𝐿(𝑌 ) [𝑌 ] evaluates exactly to the fundamental class [𝑌 ] 𝐻𝑑 (𝑌 ; ℚ). Restricting the graded equality exclusively to 𝐻𝑑 (𝑋0; ℚ) yields: 𝑓0 [𝑀0] = sgn(𝐷) [𝑋0]. However, by the geometric definition of the proper mapping degree, 𝑓0 [𝑀0] = 𝐷[𝑋0]. Equating the two algebraic coefficients rigorously enforces: 𝐷 = sgn(𝐷). 20 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Because 𝐷 is strictly non-zero integer, this analytic rigidity relation exclusively bounds the proper mapping degree to exactly 𝐷 = 1 or 𝐷 = 1. Step 4: Final Contradiction In Step 2, the generalized AtiyahBorel equivariant parity constraint definitively established that the proper mapping degree 𝐷 must be an even integer to structurally sustain the free ℤ/2-action without fixed points. Simultaneously, in Step 3, analytic higher signature rigidity (via the Strong Novikov Conjecture) established that 𝐷 must equal precisely 1 to preserve the acyclic chain equivalence over the real group 𝐶-algebra. An integer cannot be simultaneously strictly even and equal to 1. This terminal geometric and algebraic contradiction mathematically proves that our initial assumption was fundamentally false. Therefore, it is definitively impossible for such manifold 𝑀 to exist. Remark C.2. The AtiyahBorel Localization Theorem described by the model appears as Theorem 2.1 of (Dwyer and Wilkerson, 1988), and should be credited differently. C.4. Problem 8 FirstProof # 8 polyhedral Lagrangian surface 𝐾 in ℝ4 is finite polyhedral complex all of whose faces are Lagrangians, and which is topological submanifold of ℝ4. Lagrangian smoothing of 𝐾 is Hamiltonian isotopy 𝐾𝑡 of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds, parameterised by (0, 1], extending to topological isotopy, parametrised by [0, 1], with endpoint 𝐾0 = 𝐾. Let 𝐾 be polyhedral Lagrangian surface with the property that exactly 4 faces meet at every vertex. Does 𝐾 necessarily have Lagrangian smoothing? Remark C.3. An expert wrote the following (paraphrased) summary of the argument. The general strategy is as follows. In Steps 1 and 2, the solution first performs local smoothing near the vertices, relying on nice linear algebra observation. In Step 3, the solution then argues that one can extend this smoothing along the edges. To do this, it makes choice of linear coordinates (𝑠, 𝑦, 𝑥2, 𝑦2) near each edge. It then interpolates between the perturbations in this coordinate chart. To perform the interpolation, the agent invokes Lagrangian suspension, which is overkill but fine. In Step 4, the solution is presumably saying that as you send the size of vertex-smoothings to zero, you can correspondingly send the size of the edge perturbations to zero. The explanation for the flux being zero is sketchy to say the least. Model Response (Agent B) Theorem. Let 𝐾 ℝ4 be polyhedral Lagrangian surface such that exactly four faces meet at every vertex. Then 𝐾 necessarily admits Lagrangian smoothing. Proof. The proof relies on the rigid symplectic geometry imposed by the 4-valent condition. We demonstrate that the tangent cone at any non-flat vertex canonically factors into an orthogonal 21 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously product involving lower-dimensional corners. This algebraic factorization enables the construction of strictly exact (zero-flux) local smoothings at the vertices. We then globally assemble these smoothings by interpolating them along the singular edges using exact Lagrangian suspensions (cobordisms). Because all local modifications are engineered to enclose strictly zero relative symplectic area, the resulting globally smooth surface accumulates identically zero symplectic flux, which rigorously guarantees its extension to global ambient Hamiltonian isotopy without any topological obstructions. Step 1: Canonical Symplectic Splitting at the Vertices Let 𝑣 𝐾 be an arbitrary vertex. Without loss of generality, translate 𝑣 to the origin. Since exactly four faces meet at 𝑣 and 𝐾 is an embedded topological surface, the local tangent cone 𝐶𝑣 consists of four 2-dimensional planar sectors meeting at the origin in continuous cycle. Let the outgoing boundary rays of the edges be generated by non-zero tangent vectors 𝑟1, 𝑟2, 𝑟3, 𝑟4 in cyclic order. The bounding rays are thus 𝑅𝑖 = ℝ0𝑟𝑖, and the faces are modeled by the sectors 𝐹𝑖 = span0(𝑟𝑖, 𝑟𝑖+1) for 𝑖 {1, 2, 3, 4} (indices modulo 4). Because 𝐾 is Lagrangian complex, the standard symplectic form 𝜔 on ℝ4 vanishes identically on each sector 𝐹𝑖. This implies that adjacent boundary tangent vectors are mutually 𝜔-orthogonal: 𝜔(𝑟1, 𝑟2) = 𝜔(𝑟2, 𝑟3) = 𝜔(𝑟3, 𝑟4) = 𝜔(𝑟4, 𝑟1) = 0. Let 𝑉 = span(𝑟1, 𝑟2, 𝑟3, 𝑟4) be the vector space spanned by the tangent cone. We classify the local geometry of 𝐶𝑣 based on the dimension of 𝑉: Case 1: dim 𝑉 = 4 (Strict Vertex). Define the 2-dimensional planes 𝑃13 = span(𝑟1, 𝑟3) and 𝑃24 = span(𝑟2, 𝑟4). The plane 𝑃13 cannot be isotropic; if it were, 𝑟1 and 𝑟3 would be mutually 𝜔-orthogonal. Combined with the incidence orthogonality inherited from the faces, 𝑟1 would be 𝜔-orthogonal to 𝑟1, 𝑟2, 𝑟3, and 𝑟4. Since these vectors span all of 𝑉 = ℝ4, 𝑟1 would be 𝜔orthogonal to the entirety of ℝ4. By the non-degeneracy of 𝜔, this forces 𝑟1 = 0, contradiction. Thus, 𝑃13 is strictly symplectic 2-plane. By the incidence relations, every vector in 𝑃24 is 𝜔-orthogonal to every vector in 𝑃13, meaning 13. Since 𝑃13 is symplectic plane, its symplectic orthogonal complement 𝑃𝜔 𝑃24 𝑃𝜔 13 is also 2-dimensional symplectic plane. Because dim 𝑃24 = 2 (if the generating vectors were collinear, dim 𝑉 would drop to 3), it follows identically that 𝑃24 = 𝑃𝜔 13. This yields an orthogonal symplectic direct sum ℝ4 = 𝑃13 𝑃24. Geometrically, the tangent cone strictly factors into Cartesian product of two 1-dimensional corners: 𝐶𝑣 = 𝐶13 𝐶24 𝑃13 𝑃24, where 𝐶13 = 𝑅1 𝑅3 and 𝐶24 = 𝑅2 𝑅4. Case 2: dim 𝑉 = 3 (Crease Vertex). The restriction 𝜔𝑉 on the 3-dimensional space 𝑉 has rank 2 and must therefore possess an exactly 1-dimensional radical 𝐿. The four adjacent plane spans 𝑆𝑖 = span(𝑟𝑖, 𝑟𝑖+1) are maximal isotropic subspaces within the presymplectic space 𝑉. Because 𝐿 is the radical, any maximal isotropic subspace must contain 𝐿; thus, 𝐿 𝑆𝑖 for all 𝑖. Since dim 𝑉 = 3, the adjacent plane spans cannot all be equal. By cyclic symmetry, we may assume without loss of generality that 𝑆1 𝑆2. Since both are 2-dimensional planes in 3-dimensional space, their intersection is exactly 1-dimensional. Because 𝐿 𝑆1 and 𝐿 𝑆2, this intersection must be exactly 𝐿. However, the shared boundary tangent vector 𝑟2 lies in 𝑆1 𝑆2, which strictly forces 𝐿 = span(𝑟2). Because the sector 𝐹2 is valid, non-degenerate 2-dimensional cone, its boundary vectors 𝑟2 and 𝑟3 are linearly independent. Thus, 𝑟3 cannot span 𝐿. This immediately implies that 𝑆2 and 𝑆3 cannot be distinct (otherwise 𝐿 = span(𝑟3) by identical logic). Thus 𝑆2 = 𝑆3. Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Similarly, 𝑟1 cannot span 𝐿, strictly forcing 𝑆4 = 𝑆1. Therefore, the plane spans coincide in adjacent pairs. Since 𝑆1 𝑆3 (otherwise all generating vectors would be coplanar and dim 𝑉 = 2), their single intersection 𝑆1 𝑆3 contains both 𝑟2 and 𝑟4, yielding exactly 𝐿 = span(𝑟2) = span(𝑟4). Because the rays 𝑅2 and 𝑅4 bound non-overlapping, valid topological sectors, they must be opposite rays (𝑟4 = 𝑐𝑟2 for some 𝑐 > 0) spanning the singular line 𝐿. The adjacent sectors merge into two flat half-planes meeting along 𝐿. Geometrically, the tangent cone 𝐶𝑣 factors into Cartesian product 𝐿 𝐶, where 𝐶 is 1-dimensional corner in the 2-dimensional symplectic quotient space 𝑉/𝐿. Case 3: dim 𝑉 = 2 (Flat Vertex). If dim 𝑉 = 2, 𝑉 is 2-dimensional Lagrangian plane (since it is spanned by isotropic sectors). The standard symplectic form 𝜔 vanishes identically on 𝑉. The four generating tangent vectors lie in 𝑉 in cyclic order. Because exactly four faces meet at 𝑣 and 𝐾 forms topological surface, the four convex sectors perfectly tile neighborhood of the origin in 𝑉 without any gaps or overlaps. Therefore, the tangent cone 𝐶𝑣 is exactly the completely flat plane 𝑉 itself, meaning the vertex is inherently smooth and requires no local modification. Step 2: Exact Local Smoothing of the Vertices We define an exact smooth local modification Σ𝑣 for each type of vertex 𝑣: Strict vertex (dim 𝑉 = 4): We resolve the corners 𝐶13 𝑃13 and 𝐶24 𝑃24 independently. In 𝑃13, we select smooth, embedded 1-dimensional curve 𝛾13 that rounds the corner 𝐶13 and strictly coincides with the rays 𝑅1, 𝑅3 outside compact ball of radius 𝑅. Crucially, to ensure that the local vertex modifications do not overlap along the edges, we explicitly require 𝑅 < 1 2 min𝐸 𝐿𝐸, where the minimum is taken over all edge lengths 𝐿𝐸 in 𝐾. We require this smoothing to be exact: the signed symplectic area enclosed between 𝛾13 and 𝐶13 is identically zero (achieved by allowing 𝛾13 to smoothly dip slightly outside the sectors bounds to balance the removed positive area). We symmetrically choose an exact smoothing 𝛾24 𝑃24 under the identical radius bound 𝑅. Because 𝑃13 and 𝑃24 are symplectically orthogonal, their Cartesian product Σ𝑣 = 𝛾13 𝛾24 is smooth, exact Lagrangian surface that locally resolves 𝐶𝑣. Crease vertex (dim 𝑉 = 3): The tangent cone is 𝐶𝑣 = 𝐿 𝐶. We choose smooth, exact 1dimensional curve 𝛾 𝑉/𝐿 that rounds the corner 𝐶, subject to the strict upper bound on the modification radius 𝑅. We define the smoothing as Σ𝑣 = 𝐿 𝛾. Because 𝐿 is the radical of 𝜔𝑉, Σ𝑣 is an isotropic surface; being 2-dimensional, it is smooth, exact Lagrangian plane. Flat vertex (dim 𝑉 = 2): Because 𝐶𝑣 = 𝑉 is smooth plane, we trivially set Σ𝑣 = 𝑉, which is inherently exact. Step 3: Edge Interpolation via Lagrangian Suspension We now interpolate the exact local vertex smoothings along the edges of 𝐾. If the two faces meeting at an edge 𝐸 are coplanar, the surface is locally flat plane along 𝐸 and requires no interpolation. We therefore restrict attention to singular edges 𝐸 of length 𝐿𝐸 connecting vertices 𝑣0 and 𝑣1. The 2-dimensional linear spans of the two non-coplanar flat faces meeting at 𝐸, denoted span(𝐹𝐿) and span(𝐹𝑅), define constant 3-dimensional coisotropic subspace 𝑌𝐸 = span(𝐹𝐿) + span(𝐹𝑅). Because span(𝐹𝐿) and span(𝐹𝑅) are Lagrangian planes, their symplectic orthogonals satisfy span(𝐹𝐿)𝜔 = span(𝐹𝐿) and span(𝐹𝑅)𝜔 = span(𝐹𝑅). Consequently, the symplectic orthogonal complement of 𝑌𝐸 is exactly 𝑌 𝜔 𝐸 = (span(𝐹𝐿) + span(𝐹𝑅))𝜔 = span(𝐹𝐿) span(𝐹𝑅) = span(𝐸). The symplectic quotient 𝑊𝐸 = 𝑌𝐸/span(𝐸) is 2-dimensional symplectic plane. The geometric projection of the subsets 𝐹𝐿 𝐹𝑅 into 𝑊𝐸 forms fixed 1-dimensional corner 𝐶𝐸. Outside the immediate vertex neighborhoods, the local exact smoothings Σ𝑣0 and Σ𝑣1 seamlessly restrict along 𝐸 to products over transverse curves Γ0, Γ1 𝑊𝐸 that smooth 𝐶𝐸. Because the local models were constructed to be exact, both Γ0 and Γ1 bound identically zero symplectic 23 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously area with 𝐶𝐸, and thus zero algebraic area with each other. By the area-preserving mapping theorem (Mosers trick) on the plane 𝑊𝐸, there exists compactly supported, time-dependent Hamiltonian 𝐻𝑠 : 𝑊𝐸 ℝ for 𝑠 [0, 𝐿𝐸] whose exact flow Φ𝑠 smoothly isotopes Γ0 to Γ1 (such that Φ𝐿𝐸 (Γ0) = Γ1), with 𝐻𝑠 0 in small neighborhoods of the endpoints 𝑠 = 0 and 𝑠 = 𝐿𝐸. We construct the interpolation surface Σ𝐸 along the edge via an exact Lagrangian suspension. Because 𝐸 is straight segment, we can establish global linear Darboux coordinates (𝑠, 𝑦, 𝑥2, 𝑦2) adapted to 𝐸 such that 𝑠 [0, 𝐿𝐸] parameterizes the edge 𝐸, (𝑥2, 𝑦2) are canonical Darboux coordinates for the symplectic slice 𝑊𝐸, and 𝑦 is the conjugate normal momentum. Specifically, the coordinate vector field 𝑦 is strictly 𝜔-orthogonal to 𝑊𝐸 and normalized so that 𝜔(𝑠, 𝑦) = 1. The unperturbed coisotropic subspace 𝑌𝐸 corresponds precisely to the hyperplane { 𝑦 = 0}. In these coordinates, the ambient symplectic form evaluates to 𝜔 = 𝑑𝑠 𝑑 𝑦 + 𝜔𝑊𝐸 . We define the suspended surface dynamically: (cid:110)(cid:16) Σ𝐸 = 𝑠, 𝐻𝑠 (Φ𝑠 (𝑞)), Φ𝑠 (𝑞) (cid:17) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) 𝑠 [0, 𝐿𝐸], 𝑞 Γ0 (cid:111) . To verify that Σ𝐸 is Lagrangian, we pull back the symplectic form via the parameterization map 𝐹(𝑠, 𝑞) = (𝑠, 𝐻𝑠 (Φ𝑠 (𝑞)), Φ𝑠 (𝑞)). The differential of the 𝑦-coordinate yields 𝑑 𝑦 = 𝑑𝑞( 𝐻𝑠 Φ𝑠) ( 𝐻𝑠Φ𝑠 ) 𝑠 𝑑𝑠. Wedging with 𝑑𝑠 eliminates the purely temporal term: 𝐹(𝑑𝑠 𝑑 𝑦) = 𝑑𝑠 𝑑𝑞( 𝐻𝑠 Φ𝑠). Evaluating the pullback of 𝜔𝑊𝐸 on tangent vectors 𝑠 and 𝑣 𝑇𝑞Γ0, we apply the defining relation of the Hamiltonian vector field 𝜄𝑋𝐻𝑠 𝜔𝑊𝐸 = 𝑑 𝐻𝑠: (𝐹𝜔𝑊𝐸 )(𝑠, 𝑣) = 𝜔𝑊𝐸 (𝑠Φ𝑠, 𝑑𝑞Φ𝑠 (𝑣)) = 𝜔𝑊𝐸 ((𝑋𝐻𝑠)Φ𝑠 (𝑞) , 𝑑𝑞Φ𝑠 (𝑣)) = (𝑑 𝐻𝑠)Φ𝑠 (𝑞) (𝑑𝑞Φ𝑠 (𝑣)) = 𝑑𝑞( 𝐻𝑠 Φ𝑠)(𝑣) Because Γ0 is 1-dimensional curve, the restriction of 𝜔𝑊𝐸 to Γ0 evaluates to identically zero. The full pullback is thus exactly 𝐹𝜔𝑊𝐸 = 𝑑𝑠 𝑑𝑞( 𝐻𝑠 Φ𝑠). Summing these contributions yields perfect cancellation via the chain rule: 𝐹𝜔 = 𝑑𝑠 𝑑𝑞( 𝐻𝑠 Φ𝑠) + 𝑑𝑠 𝑑𝑞( 𝐻𝑠 Φ𝑠) = 0. Thus, Σ𝐸 is strictly Lagrangian. Furthermore, because 𝐻𝑠 0 near 𝑠 = 0 and 𝑠 = 𝐿𝐸, the normal displacement 𝑦 = 𝐻𝑠 (Φ𝑠 (𝑞)) vanishes identically there. This ensures that Σ𝐸 resides strictly inside 𝑌𝐸 at its endpoints, flawlessly merging with the exact local planar bounds of the vertex models Σ𝑣0 and Σ𝑣1. Step 4: Global Hamiltonian Isotopy By uniformly patching the exact vertex smoothings Σ𝑣 and the exact edge suspensions Σ𝐸, we obtain globally smooth, embedded Lagrangian surface 𝐾1. To construct the required continuous topological isotopy 𝐾𝑡 for 𝑡 (0, 1] extending continuously to 𝐾0 = 𝐾, we linearly rescale the exact local modifications. The vertex smoothings uniformly shrink toward the original corners via the spatial scaling 𝑡Σ𝑣. For the edge interpolations, the scaled transverse curves 𝑡Γ0 and 𝑡Γ1 are isotoped by the rescaled Hamiltonian 𝐻 (𝑡) (𝑞) = 𝑡2 𝐻𝑠 (𝑞/𝑡), generating the exact scaled flow Φ (𝑡) (𝑞) = 𝑡Φ𝑠 (𝑞/𝑡). The normal Darboux displacement within the suspension is given by 𝑦 = 𝐻 (𝑡) , which scales strictly as (𝑡2). 𝑠 Φ (𝑡) 𝑠 𝑠 𝑠 24 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously As 𝑡 0, the transverse smoothing limits uniformly scale as (𝑡) while the normal 𝑦displacements scale as (𝑡2), ensuring that both strictly vanish in the limit. The continuous family of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds 𝐾𝑡 (𝑡 > 0) thereby strictly converges in 𝐶0 to the initial topological complex 𝐾0 = 𝐾. Finally, because every local geometric modificationvertex roundings and edge suspensionswas rigorously constructed as an exact Lagrangian cobordism relative to the unperturbed flat faces, the global symplectic flux is strictly zero. By Weinsteins Lagrangian Neighborhood Theorem, this exact regular homotopy of smooth Lagrangian embeddings 𝐾𝑡 lifts to compactly supported, global ambient Hamiltonian isotopy. Therefore, 𝐾𝑡 constitutes genuine Lagrangian smoothing of 𝐾. C.5. Problem 9 FirstProof # 9 Let 𝑛 5. Let 𝐴(1) , . . . , 𝐴(𝑛) ℝ34 be Zariski-generic. For 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 [𝑛], construct 𝑄 (𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿) ℝ3333 so that its (𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘, ℓ) entry for 1 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘, ℓ 3 is given by 𝑄 (𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿) = det[ 𝐴(𝛼) (𝑖, : ); 𝐴( 𝛽) ( 𝑗, :); 𝐴(𝛾) (𝑘, :); 𝐴(𝛿) (ℓ, :)]. Here 𝐴(𝑖, :) denotes the 𝑖th row of matrix 𝐴, and semicolon denotes vertical concatenation. We are interested in algebraic relations on the set of tensors {𝑄 (𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿) : 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 [𝑛]}. More precisely, does there exist polynomial map : ℝ81𝑛4 ℝ𝑁 that satisfies the following three properties? 𝑖 𝑗𝑘ℓ The map does not depend on 𝐴(1) , . . . 𝐴(𝑛) . The degrees of the coordinate functions of do not depend on 𝑛. Let 𝜆 ℝ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 satisfy 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 0 for precisely 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 [𝑛] that are not identical. Then F(𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿𝑄 (𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿) : 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 [𝑛]) = 0 holds if and only if there exist 𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑤, 𝑥 (ℝ)𝑛 such that 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 = 𝑢𝛼𝑣𝛽𝑤𝛾 𝑥𝛿 for all 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 [𝑛] that are not identical. Model Response (Agent A𝔣) Construction of the Polynomial Map Let 𝐴(1) , . . . , 𝐴(𝑛) ℝ34 be Zariski-generic matrices. We identify the formal input space ℝ81𝑛4 with the vector space of 4-way tensors ℝ3𝑛3𝑛3𝑛3𝑛. We index the components of this tensor via composite multi-indices 𝐼 = (𝛼, 𝑖), 𝐽 = ( 𝛽, 𝑗), 𝐾 = (𝛾, 𝑘), and 𝐿 = (𝛿, ℓ), where 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿 [𝑛] specify the choice of matrices and 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘, ℓ {1, 2, 3} specify their localized row indices. Evaluated over the parameters of the problem, the tensor coordinates map to: X𝐼 𝐽 𝐾𝐿 = 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿𝑄 (𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿) 𝑖 𝑗𝑘ℓ = 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 det 𝐴(𝛼) (𝑖, :) 𝐴( 𝛽) ( 𝑗, :) 𝐴(𝛾) (𝑘, :) 𝐴(𝛿) (ℓ, :) . Remark C.4. We say parameter tuple (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿) is monochromatic if 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 𝛿, and non-monochromatic otherwise. For any 𝛼 [𝑛], the array 𝑄 (𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼) evaluates the determinant 25 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously of 4 4 matrix whose four rows are drawn entirely from the same 3 4 matrix 𝐴(𝛼) . By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these row choices must evaluate to the identical row of 𝐴(𝛼) , making the determinant unconditionally vanish. Thus, 𝑄 (𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼) = 0 universally. Consequently, X𝐼 𝐽 𝐾𝐿 = 0 unconditionally for all monochromatic tuples. The problem dictates that 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 0 solely across non-monochromatic configurations; nevertheless, extending the scalar parameters 𝜆𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 arbitrarily over the monochromatic bounds leaves the evaluated tensor completely unaltered. We define four principal multilinear matrix flattenings of X, each mapping naturally to structured matrix of dimensions 3𝑛 27𝑛3: 𝑀 (1) : Rows indexed by 𝐼, columns by 𝐶1 = ( 𝐽, 𝐾, 𝐿). 𝑀 (2) : Rows indexed by 𝐽, columns by 𝐶2 = (𝐼, 𝐾, 𝐿). 𝑀 (3) : Rows indexed by 𝐾, columns by 𝐶3 = (𝐼, 𝐽, 𝐿). 𝑀 (4) : Rows indexed by 𝐿, columns by 𝐶4 = (𝐼, 𝐽, 𝐾). Definition 7. We define the polynomial map : ℝ81𝑛4 ℝ𝑁, where 𝑁 = 4(cid:0)3𝑛 (cid:1), such that 5 its coordinate functions evaluate all 5 5 minors across the four flattenings 𝑀 (1) , 𝑀 (2) , 𝑀 (3) , and 𝑀 (4) . (cid:1) (cid:0)27𝑛3 5 This multilinear representation immediately secures the problems first two requisite properties: Property 1: The coordinate functions of are standard determinantal minor expansions evaluated strictly over the formal tensor variables X𝐼 𝐽 𝐾𝐿. Their coefficients consist exclusively of the constants 1 and 0. Thus, the polynomial map operates completely independently of the underlying generic matrices 𝐴(1) , . . . , 𝐴(𝑛) . Property 2: Each coordinate function extracts 5 5 minor, rigorously defining it as homogeneous polynomial of exact degree 5 over the tensor inputs. This uniform degree is invariant and strictly independent of 𝑛. Proof of Property 3: Sufficiency Assume there exist scalar vectors 𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑤, 𝑥 (ℝ)𝑛 such that 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 = 𝑢𝛼𝑣𝛽𝑤𝛾 𝑥𝛿 holds across all valid non-monochromatic configurations. By Remark C.4, since 𝑄 (𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼) = 0, applying the identically factored substitution 𝜆𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 = 𝑢𝛼𝑣𝛼𝑤𝛼𝑥𝛼 over the excluded monochromatic bounds leaves perfectly unaltered. Absorbing these parameters via the multilinearity of the determinant globally yields: 𝑢𝛼 𝐴(𝛼) (𝑖, :) 𝑣𝛽 𝐴( 𝛽) ( 𝑗, :) 𝑤𝛾 𝐴(𝛾) (𝑘, :) 𝑥𝛿 𝐴(𝛿) (ℓ, :) For the first flattening 𝑀 (1) , let the localized row vector 𝑈𝐼 = 𝑢𝛼 𝐴(𝛼) (𝑖, :) ℝ4. Expanding the determinant via Laplace expansion along this leading row extracts: X𝐼 𝐽 𝐾𝐿 = det . 𝑀 (1) 𝐼,𝐶1 = 4 𝑚=1 (𝑈𝐼)𝑚 cofactor1,𝑚 𝑈𝐼 𝑣𝛽 𝐴( 𝛽) ( 𝑗, :) 𝑤𝛾 𝐴(𝛾) (𝑘, :) 𝑥𝛿 𝐴(𝛿) (ℓ, :) . 26 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously The four scalar cofactor terms intrinsically evaluate using exclusively the column configuration 𝐶1 and remain completely decoupled from the localized row index 𝐼. Hence, 𝑀 (1) structurally factors into the matrix product of 3𝑛 4 matrix and 4 27𝑛3 matrix. This mathematically guarantees rank(𝑀 (1) ) 4, geometrically forcing all of its 5 5 minors to evaluate to zero. Symmetric parity across the exterior maps subsequently ensures rank(𝑀 (𝑚) ) 4 for all flattenings 𝑚 {1, 2, 3, 4}, unconditionally verifying F(X) = 0. Proof of Property 3: Necessity Assume F(X) = 0. The universal vanishing of all 5 5 minors strictly bounds the rank identically as rank(𝑀 (𝑚) ) 4 across all four principal flattenings. Subspace Intersections and the Evaluation Map Let 𝑆 ℝ27𝑛3 be the row space of 𝑀 (1) , which inherently satisfies dim 𝑆 4. Let 𝑈𝛼 = rowspan( 𝐴(𝛼) ) ℝ4 denote the generic 3-dimensional row space of matrix 𝐴(𝛼) . We define linear evaluation map 𝑇𝛼 : 𝑈𝛼 𝑆 that maps generic spatial vector 𝑦 = (cid:205)3 𝑐𝑖 𝐴(𝛼) (𝑖, :) 𝑈𝛼 𝑖=1 into the equivalent linear combination of the corresponding rows within 𝑆. Evaluated locally on subset of columns forming fixed block 𝐵 = ( 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿) [𝑛]3, this equivalently leverages multilinearity to output: 𝑇𝛼( 𝑦)𝐵 = 𝜆𝛼𝐵Ψ𝐵 ( 𝑦), where Ψ𝐵 ( 𝑦) 𝑗𝑘ℓ = det 𝑦 𝐴( 𝛽) ( 𝑗, :) 𝐴(𝛾) (𝑘, :) 𝐴(𝛿) (ℓ, :) , and 𝜆𝛼𝐵 abbreviates 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿. Evaluating Ψ𝐵 ( 𝑦) = 0 is algebraically equivalent to stating that 𝑦 𝑤1 𝑤2 𝑤3 = 0 within the exterior algebra Λ4ℝ4 for all valid combinations 𝑤1 𝑈𝛽, 𝑤2 𝑈𝛾, 𝑤3 𝑈𝛿. Lemma 2. Let 𝑉 = ℝ4, and let 𝐴(1) , . . . , 𝐴(𝑛) be generic 3 4 matrices with row spaces 𝑈𝑖 = rowspan( 𝐴(𝑖) ). (i) If 𝐵 = ( 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿) is non-monochromatic, then ker Ψ𝐵 = {0}. (ii) If 𝐵 = ( 𝛽, 𝛽, 𝛽) is monochromatic, then ker Ψ𝐵 = 𝑈𝛽. Proof. The constraint Ψ𝐵 ( 𝑦) = 0 requires 𝑦 𝑤1 𝑤2 𝑤3 = 0 for all 𝑤1 𝑈𝛽, 𝑤2 𝑈𝛾, 𝑤3 𝑈𝛿. (i) Assume 𝐵 is non-monochromatic. Since the wedge product is commutative up to sign, we may assume without loss of generality that 𝛽 𝛿. We consider the structural span of the 2-forms 𝑤1 𝑤2. If 𝛽 𝛾, 𝑈𝛽 and 𝑈𝛾 are distinct generic 3-dimensional subspaces intersecting in 2-dimensional subspace within 𝑉. Constructing basis adapted to this intersection yields 6 linearly independent 2-forms, proving the span of 𝑤1 𝑤2 covers the entirety of Λ2𝑉. If 𝛽 = 𝛾, the span of 𝑤1 𝑤2 for 𝑤1, 𝑤2 𝑈𝛽 evaluates exactly to Λ2𝑈𝛽, 3-dimensional subspace natively housed within Λ2𝑉. In both cases, the span contains Λ2𝑈𝛽. Consequently, the overarching span of 𝑤1 𝑤2 𝑤3 contains Λ2𝑈𝛽 𝑈𝛿. Since 𝛽 𝛿, the generic 3-dimensional subspaces 𝑈𝛽 and 𝑈𝛿 reliably intersect in 2-dimensional subspace. By decomposing this space as 𝑈𝛿 = (𝑈𝛽 𝑈𝛿) span(𝑣) for specific 𝑣 𝑈𝛿 𝑈𝛽, we deduce: Λ2𝑈𝛽 𝑈𝛿 = (Λ2𝑈𝛽 (𝑈𝛽 𝑈𝛿)) (Λ2𝑈𝛽 𝑣) = Λ3𝑈𝛽 (Λ2𝑈𝛽 𝑣). 27 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously It is immediate that Λ3𝑈𝛽 is exactly 1-dimensional. Furthermore, since 𝑣 𝑈𝛽, wedging with 𝑣 injectively maps Λ2𝑈𝛽 into Λ3𝑉, meaning Λ2𝑈𝛽 𝑣 is strictly 3-dimensional. To verify the trivial intersection parity, suppose an element 0 𝜂 Λ3𝑈𝛽 satisfies 𝜂 = 𝜔 𝑣 for some 𝜔 Λ2𝑈𝛽. Given any 𝑥 𝑈𝛽, evaluating 𝜂 𝑥 = 0 strictly forces 𝜔 𝑥 𝑣 = 0. Since 𝑉 = 𝑈𝛽 span(𝑣), we must assert 𝜔 𝑥 = 0 in Λ3𝑈𝛽 uniformly over all 𝑥 𝑈𝛽. The non-degenerate pairing dictates this is only possible if 𝜔 = 0, yielding 𝜂 = 0, forming contradiction. Therefore, the algebraic sum directly establishes itself over 1 + 3 = 4 dimensions. Because dim Λ3𝑉 = 4, the established span encompasses exactly Λ3𝑉. Enforcing 𝑦 Ω = 0 for all valid Ω Λ3𝑉 unconditionally forces 𝑦 = 0. (ii) If 𝐵 = ( 𝛽, 𝛽, 𝛽), the span corresponding to 𝑤1 𝑤2 𝑤3 converges exclusively to Λ3𝑈𝛽, representing the 1-dimensional volume form bounding 𝑈𝛽. Resolving 𝑦 Λ3𝑈𝛽 = 0 structurally enforces 𝑦 𝑈𝛽. Given 𝑛 5, for any isolated generic index 𝛼 [𝑛], we explicitly choose non-monochromatic block 𝐵 = (𝜎, 𝜎, 𝜏) mapping elements strictly disjoint from 𝛼 (requiring exactly 3 𝑛 distinct indices). Because the evaluated tuple (𝛼, 𝜎, 𝜎, 𝜏) is strictly non-monochromatic, the premise guarantees 𝜆𝛼𝐵 0. Bounded against Lemma 2(i), evaluating 𝑇𝛼( 𝑦)𝐵 = 0 = 𝑦 = 0, validating that 𝑇𝛼 is universally injective. Its equivalently mapped image 𝑊𝛼 = 𝑇𝛼(𝑈𝛼) 𝑆 firmly maintains dimension 3. Anchored dynamically against dim 𝑆 4, Grassmanns formula for the dimension of subspace intersections necessitates: dim(𝑊𝛼 𝑊𝜇) = dim 𝑊𝛼 + dim 𝑊𝜇 dim(𝑊𝛼 + 𝑊𝜇) 3 + 3 4 = 2 for any 𝛼 𝜇. Universal Local Factoring Let 𝐸𝛼,𝜇 = 𝑇 1 𝛼 (𝑊𝛼 𝑊𝜇) 𝑈𝛼. Grounded strictly by injectivity, dim 𝐸𝛼,𝜇 2. For any vector 𝑥 𝐸𝛼,𝜇, there universally exists unique vector 𝑦 𝑈𝜇 firmly satisfying 𝑇𝛼(𝑥) = 𝑇𝜇 ( 𝑦). Pivoting on 𝑛 5, we securely configure non-monochromatic block 𝐵0 = (𝜎, 𝜎, 𝜏) mutually disjoint from both bounds 𝛼 and 𝜇 (leveraging exactly 2 + 2 = 4 𝑛 indices). Extracting locally outputs 𝑇𝛼(𝑥)𝐵0 = 𝑇𝜇 ( 𝑦)𝐵0, mapping identically onto 𝜆𝛼𝐵0 Applying the multilinearity of Ψ𝐵0 enforces Ψ𝐵0 (𝜆𝛼𝐵0 𝑦) = 0. Validating against ker Ψ𝐵0 = {0} and knowing the corresponding scalars unconditionally correspond to non-monochromatic configurations (thus are non-zero), we extract 𝜆𝛼𝐵0 𝑦. Structuring 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 = 𝜆𝛼𝐵0/𝜆 𝜇𝐵0 0, we unconditionally isolate 𝑦 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝑥. Since 𝑦 𝑈𝜇 and 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 0, it implies 𝑥 𝑈𝜇. Thus, 𝐸𝛼,𝜇 𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇. Bounding the intersection of two generic 3-dimensional spaces in ℝ4 caps the dimension at exactly 2, ensuring 𝐸𝛼,𝜇 = 𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇. Using the explicit relation 𝑇𝛼(𝑥) = 𝑇𝜇 (𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝑥), we logically evaluate the mappings globally over generalized tracking block 𝐵: Ψ𝐵0 (𝑥) = 𝜆 𝜇𝐵0 𝑥 𝜆 𝜇𝐵0 𝑥 = 𝜆 𝜇𝐵0 Ψ𝐵0 ( 𝑦). 𝑇𝛼(𝑥)𝐵 = 𝑇𝜇 (𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝑥)𝐵 = (𝜆𝛼𝐵 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝜆 𝜇𝐵)Ψ𝐵 (𝑥) = 0 for all 𝑥 𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇. Because dim(𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇) = 2, we mathematically isolate the coefficients 𝜆𝛼𝐵 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝜆 𝜇𝐵 by filtering against ker Ψ𝐵: If 𝐵 is non-monochromatic, ker Ψ𝐵 = {0}. Consequently, for any valid non-zero 𝑥 𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇, resolving Ψ𝐵 (𝑥) 0 securely enforces 𝜆𝛼𝐵 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝜆 𝜇𝐵. If 𝐵 = ( 𝛽, 𝛽, 𝛽) with 𝛽 {𝛼, 𝜇}, Lemma 2 forces ker Ψ𝐵 = 𝑈𝛽. The generic intersection (𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇) 𝑈𝛽 yields exactly dimension 2 + 3 4 = 1. Since dim(𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇) = 2, there exists an element 𝑥 (𝑈𝛼 𝑈𝜇) 𝑈𝛽, universally validating Ψ𝐵 (𝑥) 0. This rigorously forces 𝜆𝛼𝐵 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝜆 𝜇𝐵. 28 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously the mapped equivalence holds cleanly for all valid evaluations 𝐵 Therefore, {(𝛼, 𝛼, 𝛼), (𝜇, 𝜇, 𝜇)}. To decipher the transitive cocycle condition 𝑐𝛼,𝜈 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝑐𝜇,𝜈 for three distinct variable indices 𝛼, 𝜇, 𝜈 [𝑛], we purposefully select 2-element non-monochromatic block 𝐵2 = (𝜌, 𝜌, 𝜅) mutually disjoint from 𝛼, 𝜇, and 𝜈. This geometric verification guarantees applicability because 3 + 2 = 5 𝑛. Resolving outside monochromatic boundaries yields 𝜆𝛼𝐵2 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝜆 𝜇𝐵2, 𝜆 𝜇𝐵2 = 𝑐𝜇,𝜈𝜆𝜈𝐵2, and 𝜆𝛼𝐵2 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜈𝜆𝜈𝐵2. Directly dividing these inherently non-zero quantities verifies the cocycle property 𝑐𝛼,𝜈 = 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 𝑐𝜇,𝜈. We define 𝑢1 = 1 and 𝑢𝛼 = 𝑐𝛼,1 for 𝛼 2, meaning 𝑐𝛼,𝜇 = 𝑢𝛼/𝑢𝜇. We securely decouple 𝑌𝐵 = 𝜆1𝐵 evaluating 𝐵 (1, 1, 1), alongside bounds 𝑌111 = 𝜆2,1,1,1/𝑢2. This strictly limits coordinates globally as 𝜆𝛼𝐵 = 𝑢𝛼𝑌𝐵 over all non-monochromatic tuples (𝛼, 𝐵): Bounding 𝐵 {(1, 1, 1), (𝛼, 𝛼, 𝛼)}, we obtain 𝜆𝛼𝐵 = 𝑐𝛼,1𝜆1𝐵 = 𝑢𝛼𝑌𝐵. Bounding over 𝐵 = (1, 1, 1), the evaluated tuple (𝛼, 1, 1, 1) strictly mandates nonmonochromatic parity, inherently forcing 𝛼 1. Fixing 𝜇 = 2 (valid using 𝑛 5), resolving 𝛼 2 outputs 𝜆𝛼,1,1,1 = 𝑐𝛼,2𝜆2,1,1,1 = (𝑢𝛼/𝑢2)𝜆2,1,1,1 = 𝑢𝛼𝑌111. For 𝛼 = 2, identity holds trivially. Mirroring sequential deductions identically over equivalent matrix flattenings 𝑀 (2) , 𝑀 (3) , and 𝑀 (4) guarantees the existence of complementary vectors 𝑣, 𝑤, 𝑥 (ℝ)𝑛 mapped over spatial tracking tensors 𝑍, 𝑃, 𝑄, uniformly restricting parameters universally across valid subsets: 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 = 𝑢𝛼𝑌𝛽𝛾𝛿 = 𝑣𝛽 𝑍𝛼𝛾𝛿 = 𝑤𝛾 𝑃𝛼𝛽𝛿 = 𝑥𝛿𝑄𝛼𝛽𝛾. Global Connectedness of the Valid Configuration Graph Let [𝑛]4 denote the discrete subset of exclusively non-monochromatic valid parameter multi-tuples. We formulate the universally normalized relational map 𝐻 : ℝ explicitly by: 𝐻 (𝑇) = 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 𝑢𝛼𝑣𝛽𝑤𝛾 𝑥𝛿 , evaluated strictly over 𝑇 = (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿) . Leveraging our preceding factorizations cleanly 𝑌𝛽𝛾𝛿 parses 𝐻 (𝑇) = 𝑣𝛽 𝑤𝛾 𝑥𝛿 , which is manifestly independent of the leading coordinate 𝛼. Consequently, 𝐻 (𝑇) functionally persists invariantly under dynamic shifting of the first localized coordinate element natively assuming the newly formed tuple remains bounded strictly within . Extrapolating symmetric multilinear independence logically dictates that 𝐻 (𝑇) is invariant across alterations to any single isolated coordinate, provided the intermediate tuples strictly evaluate inside . We conceptualize topologically as configuration graph network connecting multi-tuples differing exactly by single localized coordinate. The map 𝐻 (𝑇) evaluates trivially to constant value across any connected component of this graph. We now strictly establish that is entirely globally connected. Let 𝑇 . Because 𝑇 is non-monochromatic, it contains at most 3 identical coordinate values. 1. If 𝑇 contains exactly 3 identical coordinates (e.g., matching (𝑎, 𝑎, 𝑎, 𝑏) with 𝑎 𝑏), we can shift one of the identical coordinates to uniquely evaluated constant 𝑐 {𝑎, 𝑏}. Since 𝑛 5 3, such generic 𝑐 is universally valid. The resulting adjacent tuple (e.g., (𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑎, 𝑏)) inherently remains within and correctly houses at most 2 identical coordinates. Thus, every bounded tuple with 3 identical constraints trivially bounds adjacent to tuple harboring at most 2 identical coordinates. 29 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously 2. Over localized constraints containing at most 2 identical elements, we sequentially alter coordinates one-by-one, scanning left-to-right, to strictly match non-intersecting distinctly evaluated target sequence, specifically (1, 2, 3, 4). Because 𝑛 5, such discrete target sequence is naturally guaranteed to exist. At any traversal step 𝑘 {1, 2, 3, 4}, the intermediate tuple identically comprises successfully mapped prefix of length 𝑘 containing strictly unique target elements, and an unchanged trailing suffix of length 4 𝑘 natively drawn from the original values of 𝑇. Because the prefix sequence is constrained to strictly distinct entries, any given element can appear at most once across the prefix. Since the foundational original tuple 𝑇 maintained at most 2 identical evaluations, any mapped element can occur at most twice within the unchanged tracking suffix. Consequently, the maximum element occurrence frequency across the entire intermediate tuple rigorously bounds to 1 (from the distinct prefix) + 2 (from the unchanged suffix) = 3. This combinatorially ensures that no intermediate topological step can theoretically collapse to frequency of 4 (identically monochromatic parity), guaranteeing that every sequence transition evaluates safely and dynamically within the strict confines of the valid graph . Since every multi-tuple topologically connects directly to the valid boundary path (1, 2, 3, 4), the entire configuration graph is globally connected. Therefore, the function 𝐻 (𝑇) equates universally to non-zero symmetric mapping scalar 𝐾 exclusively over all strictly valid configurations 𝑇 . Scaling out the identity via 𝑢𝛼 𝐾𝑢𝛼 rigorously establishes that 𝜆𝛼𝛽𝛾𝛿 = 𝑢𝛼𝑣𝛽𝑤𝛾 𝑥𝛿 identically bridges all generic, non-monochromatic parameterizations. This fully satisfies Property 3 and conclusively completes the proof. 30 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously C.6. Problem 10 Fullproof # Given 𝑑-way tensor ℝ𝑛1 𝑛2 𝑛𝑑 such that the data is unaligned (meaning the tensor has missing entries), we consider the problem of computing CP decomposition of rank 𝑟 where some modes are infinite-dimensional and constrained to be in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We want to solve this using an alternating optimization approach, and our question is focused on the mode-𝑘 subproblem for an infinite-dimensional mode. For the subproblem, then CP factor matrices 𝐴1, . . . , 𝐴𝑘1, 𝐴𝑘+1, . . . , 𝐴𝑑 are fixed, and we are solving for 𝐴𝑘. Our notation is as follows. Let 𝑁 = (cid:206)𝑖 𝑛𝑖 denote the product of all sizes. Let 𝑛 𝑛𝑘 be the size of mode 𝑘, let 𝑀 = (cid:206)𝑖𝑘 𝑛𝑖 be the product of all dimensions except 𝑘, and assume 𝑛 𝑀. Since the data are unaligned, this means only subset of entries are observed, and we let 𝑞 𝑁 denote the number of observed entries. We let 𝑇 ℝ𝑛𝑀 denote the mode-𝑘 unfolding of the tensor with all missing entries set to zero. The vec operations creates vector from matrix by stacking its columns, and we let 𝑆 ℝ𝑁 𝑞 denote the selection matrix (a subset of the 𝑁 𝑁 identity matrix) such that 𝑆𝑇 vec(𝑇) selects the 𝑞 known entries of the tensor from the vectorization of its mode-𝑘 unfolding. We let 𝑍 = 𝐴𝑑 𝐴𝑘+1 𝐴𝑘1 𝐴1 ℝ𝑀𝑟 be the Khatri-Rao product of the factor matrices corresponding to all modes except mode 𝑘. We let 𝐵 = 𝑇 𝑍 denote the MTTKRP of the tensor and Khatri-Rao product 𝑍. We assume 𝐴𝑘 = 𝐾𝑊 where 𝐾 ℝ𝑛𝑛 denotes the psd RKHS kernel matrix for mode 𝑘. The matrix 𝑊 of size 𝑛 𝑟 is the unknown for which we must solve. The system to be solved is (cid:2)(𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (𝑍 𝐾) + 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾)(cid:3) vec(𝑊) = (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) vec(𝐵). Here, 𝐼𝑟 denotes the 𝑟 𝑟 identity matrix. This is system of size 𝑛𝑟 𝑛𝑟 Using standard linear solver costs 𝑂(𝑛3𝑟3), and explicitly forming the matrix is an additional expense. Explain how an iterative preconditioned conjugate gradient linear solver can be used to solve this problem more efficiently. Explain the method and choice of preconditioner. Explain in detail how the matrix-vector products are computed and why this works. Provide complexity analysis. We assume 𝑛, 𝑟 < 𝑞 𝑁. Avoid any computation of order 𝑁. Model Response (Agent B) Problem Formulation Given 𝑑-way tensor ℝ𝑛1 𝑛2 𝑛𝑑 such that the data is incomplete (meaning the tensor has missing entries), we consider the problem of computing Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition of rank 𝑟. We assume that the true underlying generative functions for some modes are continuous and reside in an infinite-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), whereas the observed tensor represents finite-dimensional discretization (or evaluation) of these functions at discrete points. We solve this decomposition problem using an alternating optimization approach. Our analysis focuses on the mode-𝑘 subproblem for such an RKHS-constrained mode. For the subproblem, the CP factor matrices 𝐴1, . . . , 𝐴𝑘1, 𝐴𝑘+1, . . . , 𝐴𝑑 are fixed, and we are solving for the factor matrix 𝐴𝑘. Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously 𝑖=1 Notation and Model Setup Let 𝑁 = (cid:206)𝑑 𝑛𝑖 denote the product of all tensor dimensions. Let 𝑛 𝑛𝑘 be the size of mode 𝑘, and let 𝑀 = (cid:206)𝑖𝑘 𝑛𝑖 be the product of all dimensions except 𝑘, where we assume 𝑛 𝑀. Since the data is incomplete, only subset of entries are observed. We let 𝑞 𝑁 denote the number of observed entries. Let 𝑇 ℝ𝑛𝑀 denote the mode-𝑘 unfolding of the tensor with all missing entries initialized to zero. The vec() operation creates vector from matrix by stacking its columns. We let 𝑆 ℝ𝑁 𝑞 denote the selection matrix (composed of subset of the columns of the 𝑁 𝑁 identity matrix) such that 𝑆𝑇 vec(𝑇) selects the 𝑞 known entries of the tensor from the vectorization of its mode-𝑘 unfolding. Let 𝑍 = 𝐴𝑑 𝐴𝑘+1 𝐴𝑘1 𝐴1 ℝ𝑀𝑟 be the Khatri-Rao product of the factor matrices corresponding to all modes except mode 𝑘. To strictly avoid (𝑁) memory and computational limits, 𝑍 is never explicitly constructed in full. We let 𝐵 = 𝑇 𝑍 ℝ𝑛𝑟 denote the Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP) of the tensor and the conceptually defined Khatri-Rao product 𝑍. We parameterize the factor matrix as 𝐴𝑘 = 𝐾𝑊, where 𝐾 ℝ𝑛𝑛 denotes the symmetric, positive semi-definite RKHS kernel matrix for mode 𝑘 evaluated at the discretization points. The matrix 𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟 is the unknown variable for which we must solve. Derivation of the Linear System To find 𝑊, we minimize regularized least-squares objective function over the observed entries. Setting the gradient of this objective with respect to vec(𝑊) to zero yields linear system. The right-hand side (RHS) of this system stems from the gradient of the data fidelity term, which initially takes the form (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 vec(𝑇). We rigorously simplify this expression. Since the missing entries in 𝑇 are initialized to zero, applying the projection matrix 𝑆𝑆𝑇 acts identically on the non-zero entries, yielding 𝑆𝑆𝑇 vec(𝑇) = vec(𝑇). Consequently, the RHS evaluates as: (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 vec(𝑇) = (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 vec(𝑇) = (𝑍𝑇 𝐾𝑇 ) vec(𝑇). Because the kernel matrix 𝐾 is symmetric (𝐾𝑇 = 𝐾), standard properties of the Kronecker product allow us to rewrite this cleanly as: (𝑍𝑇 𝐾) vec(𝑇) = vec(𝐾𝑇 𝑍). Substituting the MTTKRP definition 𝐵 = 𝑇 𝑍, we arrive at vec(𝐾 𝐵) = (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) vec(𝐵). Thus, the linear system to be solved is: (cid:2)(𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (𝑍 𝐾) + 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾)(cid:3) vec(𝑊) = (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) vec(𝐵), (1) where 𝐼𝑟 denotes the 𝑟 𝑟 identity matrix and 𝜆 > 0 is the regularization parameter. This is symmetric positive semi-definite system of size 𝑛𝑟 𝑛𝑟. Using standard direct linear solver requires (𝑛3𝑟3) operations. Furthermore, explicitly forming the system matrix entails an additional and prohibitive computational expense. Given the operational assumption that 𝑛, 𝑟 < 𝑞 𝑁, it is imperative to solve this system without performing any computations of order 𝑁. Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Solver To efficiently solve the large-scale system in (1), we employ the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method. As an iterative algorithm, PCG requires only the action of the system 32 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously matrix on vector, bypassing the need to explicitly construct the 𝑛𝑟 𝑛𝑟 coefficient matrix. Efficient Matrix-Vector Products The core computational step in PCG is evaluating the matrix-vector product 𝑦 = vec(𝑉) at each iteration, where = (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (𝑍 𝐾) + 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) is the system matrix, and 𝑉 ℝ𝑛𝑟 is reshaped intermediate dense matrix representing the search direction. We evaluate the product 𝑦 in an (𝑁)-free manner through the following sequence of operations: 1. First Kernel Multiplication: Compute 𝑈 = 𝐾𝑉. Since 𝐾 ℝ𝑛𝑛 and 𝑉 ℝ𝑛𝑟, this dense matrix multiplication requires (𝑛2𝑟) operations. 2. Sparse Residual Evaluation: We observe that (𝑍 𝐾) vec(𝑉) = vec(𝐾𝑉 𝑍𝑇 ) = vec(𝑈𝑍𝑇 ). The operation 𝑆𝑆𝑇 vec(𝑈𝑍𝑇 ) extracts the entries of the dense 𝑛 𝑀 matrix 𝑈𝑍𝑇 strictly at the 𝑞 observed indices specified by 𝑆, effectively mapping all unobserved entries to zero. Instead of computing the full dense 𝑛 𝑀 matrix 𝑈𝑍𝑇 , we evaluate the inner products of the corresponding rows of 𝑈 and 𝑍 exclusively for the 𝑞 observed entries. Crucially, to strictly avoid an (𝑁) memory and time bottleneck, the full Khatri-Rao product matrix 𝑍 ℝ𝑀𝑟 is never explicitly formed. The required rows of 𝑍 (corresponding to the multi-indices of the 𝑞 observed entries) are evaluated on-the-fly from the underlying CP factor matrices 𝐴𝑖 (𝑖 𝑘). Assuming the tensor order 𝑑 is small constant, forming single row of 𝑍 takes (𝑟) operations. This dynamically generates sparse 𝑛 𝑀 matrix 𝑌 containing exactly 𝑞 non-zero elements. Generating the necessary rows of 𝑍 dynamically and evaluating these 𝑞 specific entries requires strictly (𝑞𝑟) operations. 3. Sparse Matrix Multiplication: Next, leveraging the symmetry of 𝐾 (𝐾𝑇 = 𝐾), we apply the transpose operator (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 = 𝑍𝑇 𝐾𝑇 = 𝑍𝑇 𝐾 to the sparse vector vec(𝑌 ). By the standard Kronecker product vectorization identity vec( 𝐴𝐵𝐶) = (𝐶𝑇 𝐴) vec(𝐵), applying this operator to vec(𝑌 ) translates to the mathematical operation vec(𝐾𝑌 𝑍). To compute this efficiently, we first evaluate the intermediate unvectorized product 𝑃 = 𝑌 𝑍 ℝ𝑛𝑟. Because 𝑌 possesses only 𝑞 non-zeros, its right-multiplication only requires the rows of 𝑍 corresponding to its non-zero columns. Rather than instantiating 𝑍 as full matrix, we employ standard sparse MTTKRP techniques: we dynamically evaluate only these necessary rows of 𝑍 on-the-fly (or reuse them if cached from the previous step). This sparse matrix multiplication cleanly circumvents the (𝑁) instantiation of 𝑍 and requires exactly (𝑞𝑟) operations. 4. Second Kernel Multiplication: We left-multiply 𝑃 by 𝐾 to compute 𝐾𝑃 ℝ𝑛𝑟. This dense matrix multiplication requires (𝑛2𝑟) operations. 5. Regularization Addition: The Tikhonov regularization term simplifies to 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) vec(𝑉) = vec(𝜆 𝐾𝑉) = vec(𝜆𝑈). The final evaluated vector 𝑦 is cleanly obtained via the addition: 𝑦 = vec(𝐾𝑃 + 𝜆𝑈). Jacobi Preconditioner The convergence rate of PCG strongly depends on the condition number of the system matrix. RKHS kernel matrices frequently exhibit rapidly decaying eigenvalues, and the non-uniform sampling induced by 𝑆𝑆𝑇 further degrades system conditioning. To accelerate convergence, we utilize Jacobi (diagonal) preconditioner M, defined as the inverse of the diagonal elements of . The diagonal elements of can be extracted efficiently without forming the full matrix. Let 𝐾 = 𝐾 𝐾 ℝ𝑛𝑛, where denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product. Conceptually, let 33 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously 𝑍 = 𝑍 𝑍 ℝ𝑀𝑟 denote the element-wise square of the Khatri-Rao product. Let Ω ℝ𝑛𝑀 be the sparse binary indicator matrix of the observed entries, such that Ω𝑖, 𝑗 = 1 if the entry (𝑖, 𝑗) is observed, and 0 otherwise. We now rigorously derive the diagonal of the data-fidelity term (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (𝑍 𝐾). For generic matrix 𝑄 = 𝑍 𝐾 and diagonal weight matrix = 𝑆𝑆𝑇 , the diagonal of the quadratic form 𝑄𝑇W𝑄 (expressed as column vector) is given by the identity (𝑄 𝑄)𝑇 diag(W). Since the diagonal of the projection matrix 𝑆𝑆𝑇 evaluates exactly to the vectorized observation mask vec(Ω), we can expand this expression using the mixed-product property of the Kronecker and Hadamard products. Letting vec(𝐷data) denote the diagonal of the data-fidelity term reshaped as vector, we have: vec(𝐷data) = ((𝑍 𝐾) (𝑍 𝐾))𝑇 vec(Ω) = ((𝑍 𝑍) (𝐾 𝐾))𝑇 vec(Ω) = ( 𝑍𝑇 𝐾𝑇 ) vec(Ω). Because the kernel matrix 𝐾 is symmetric, its Hadamard square 𝐾 is also symmetric ( 𝐾𝑇 = 𝐾). Thus, the expression simplifies to ( 𝑍𝑇 𝐾) vec(Ω). Finally, utilizing the standard Kronecker product vectorization identity (𝐵𝑇 𝐴) vec(𝑋) = vec( 𝐴𝑋 𝐵), we substitute 𝐵 = 𝑍, 𝐴 = 𝐾, and 𝑋 = Ω to directly evaluate the expression as vec( 𝐾Ω 𝑍). Reshaping this vector back into an 𝑛 𝑟 matrix rigorously yields the stated analytical form: 𝐷data = 𝐾 (Ω 𝑍). To preserve the (𝑁)-free complexity bound, the matrix 𝑍 is never fully formed. Instead, the product Ω 𝑍 is evaluated by computing only the required rows of 𝑍 corresponding to the non-zero columns of Ω. These rows are obtained on-the-fly by squaring the elements of the dynamically computed rows of 𝑍. Computing the sparse-dense matrix product Ω 𝑍 in this dynamic fashion costs (𝑞𝑟), and the subsequent dense multiplication by 𝐾 costs (𝑛2𝑟). The diagonal of the regularization term 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾), when reshaped into an 𝑛 𝑟 matrix, is simply 𝐷reg = 𝜆 diag(𝐾)1𝑇 𝑟 , where diag(𝐾) is the column vector containing the diagonal entries of 𝐾, and 1𝑟 ℝ𝑟 is the vector of all ones. Thus, the Jacobi preconditioner is formed by taking the element-wise inverse of 𝐷 = 𝐷data + 𝐷reg. Constructing this preconditioner upfront requires one-time cost of (𝑞𝑟 + 𝑛2𝑟). Complexity Analysis By meticulously structuring the computations as outlined above and leveraging the on-the-fly row evaluation of Khatri-Rao products, the evaluation of the matrix-vector products and the preconditioner rigorously circumvents the prohibitive (𝑁) operations that would result from forming the full Khatri-Rao product or explicitly processing the full unfolded tensor. The overall computational complexity per PCG iteration is strictly bounded by the sum of the individual algorithmic steps: (𝑛2𝑟) + (𝑞𝑟) + (𝑞𝑟) + (𝑛2𝑟) + (𝑛𝑟) = (𝑞𝑟 + 𝑛2𝑟). Given the operational regime where 𝑛, 𝑟 < 𝑞 𝑁, this strategy guarantees massive reduction in computational overhead, establishing highly scalable and optimal method for updating infinite-dimensional RKHS modes within large-scale, incomplete CP tensor decompositions. 34 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously C.7. Independent Public Deep Think Evaluation for Problem 10 For Problem 10, Aryan Mokhtari and David Woodruff conducted an independent, human-guided evaluation using the publicly available Gemini 3 Deep Think model. The resulting solution was also sent to the FirstProof authors in the same February 13 e-mail prior to the deadline. We felt the solution was interesting because this model is publicly available and performs significantly less inference scaling than Aletheia. The authors generated several samples and asked the model to concatenate and compare the two strongest outputs found, yielding an optimized solution for Problem 10. While Aletheias autonomous Agent solution maintains an (𝑞𝑟) term per Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) iteration, the concatenated public model output utilizes pre-aggregated geometry approach (via per-row Gram accumulators) with an exact block-Jacobi preconditioner. This achieves per-iteration cost of (𝑛2𝑟 + 𝑛𝑟2), strictly removing the dependency on 𝑞 during the iterative loop. For dense observation regimes where 𝑞 = 𝜔(𝑛), this provides stronger theoretical complexity bound than Aletheia B, as well as the official human author solution (O (𝑞𝑛𝑟)). We note that Aletheia also autonomously discovered this exact optimal 𝑂(𝑛2𝑟 + 𝑛𝑟2) bound and block-Jacobi preconditioner (its solution is available online here). Below we provide the output, as generated, compared, and concatenated by the public Gemini 3 Deep Think model. We format the prompt and response to match the style of the other appendices.

Model Response (Public Deep Think) Efficient Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Solvers for Unaligned RKHS-Constrained CP Subproblems Comparative Algorithmic Analysis Abstract. This document presents and compares two highly optimized, matrix-free Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solvers for the exact same problem: solving the mode-𝑘 subproblem in an unaligned, RKHS-constrained CP tensor decomposition. Both methods successfully bypass the prohibitive ambient dimensions (𝑁) and (𝑀) by exploiting Kronecker algebra. However, they diverge sharply in how they handle unaligned data geometry, their preconditioner design, and their variable tracking inside the Krylov loop. comprehensive comparative analysis highlights the specific advantages of each solver. 1. Introduction and Problem Formulation We consider the alternating optimization subproblem for an infinite-dimensional mode 𝑘 constrained to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). The factor matrix is 𝐴𝑘 = 𝐾𝑊, where 𝐾 ℝ𝑛𝑛 is the symmetric positive semi-definite (psd) RKHS kernel matrix and 𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟 is the unknown weight matrix. The symmetric linear system to solve is: (cid:2)(𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (𝑍 𝐾) + 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾)(cid:3) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) (cid:124) vec(𝑊) = (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) vec(𝐵) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) 𝑐 , (2) where ℝ𝑛𝑟𝑛𝑟. Let Ω = {1, . . . , 𝑞} index the observed entries. For each observation 𝑚 Ω, we are given its target tensor value 𝑦𝑚 ℝ, its coordinate in mode 𝑘 as 𝑖𝑚 {1, . . . , 𝑛}, and its flattened spatial coordinate in the other modes as 𝑗𝑚 {1, . . . , 𝑀}. Directly assembling requires (𝑞𝑛2𝑟2) memory, and direct dense solvers demand (𝑛3𝑟3) time. Furthermore, explicitly evaluating vectors of size 𝑁 or the Khatri-Rao product 𝑍 ℝ𝑀𝑟 introduces prohibitive (𝑁) and (𝑀) complexities. Instead, we deploy iterative Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) linear solvers acting directly on the matrix representation 𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟. 2. Comparative Analysis of the Two Approaches Both Approach 1 and Approach 2 (detailed in Sections 3 and 4) present highly optimized, matrix-free PCG solvers. However, they represent two fundamentally different algorithmic philosophies. Here is detailed comparative analysis: 2.1. Data Geometry & Matrix-Vector Product (MVP) The most significant computational difference lies in how they execute the exact Matrix-Vector Product against the 𝑞 observed tensor entries. Approach 1 (Pre-Aggregated Geometry): Approach: Aggregates the unaligned data upfront. It computes 𝑛 independent 𝑟 𝑟 symmetric matrices 𝐸 (𝑖) during the setup phase. Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously Iteration Cost: (𝑛2𝑟 + 𝑛𝑟2). Implication: By pre-computing these small matrices, the number of observations 𝑞 is completely removed from the PCG iteration loop. The MVP becomes strictly independent of the dataset size. Approach 2 (On-the-fly Sparse Accumulation): Approach: Bypasses pre-aggregation. It keeps the 𝑞 spatial observation vectors (𝑍Ω) in memory and loops over all 𝑞 points to compute dot products and accumulate gradients at every single iteration. Iteration Cost: (𝑛2𝑟 + 𝑞𝑟). Implication: This limits per-iteration scalability. In typical tensor problems, the number of observations is massive (𝑞 𝑛 𝑟). Forcing the iteration loop to process 𝑞 items every step creates massive computational bottleneck. 2.2. Preconditioner Design The linear system is severely ill-conditioned. The two approaches target completely different sources of this ill-conditioning. Approach 1 (Row-wise Block-Jacobi): Design: Explicitly extracts the 𝑛 distinct 𝑟 𝑟 diagonal blocks of the full Hessian operator and factorizes them via Cholesky decomposition (𝐿𝑖 𝐿𝑇 𝑖 ). Focus: It specifically addresses the collinearity between the 𝑟 rank-one components (a common issue in CP decomposition) while also incorporating the RKHS kernel and the missing data geometry. Cost: Demands heavier setup phase: (𝑛2𝑟2) to construct the blocks and (𝑛𝑟3) to factorize them. Approach 2 (Kernel Preconditioner 𝑃 = 𝐼𝑟 𝐾): Design: Preconditions purely with the RKHS kernel matrix. Focus: It mathematically addresses the eigenvalue decay typical of many RKHS kernels, which can help bound the condition number. However, it completely ignores the spatial collinearity of the CP components and the missing data mask. Cost: Effectively zero setup time. 2.3. PCG Loop Mechanics & Krylov Tracking How the updates are applied within the Krylov subspace loop shows trade-off between numerical stability and algebraic optimization. Approach 1 (Standard PCG): Executes standard, unconditionally stable PCG algorithm. To evaluate the residual, it requires two dense matrix multiplications by 𝐾 per iteration: 𝑈 = 𝐾 𝑃𝑘 and 𝑉𝑘 = 𝐾𝑌 + 𝜆𝑈. Approach 2 (Inverse-Free Tracking): Standard PCG would require computing 𝐾 1 for its chosen preconditioneran (𝑛3) operation that is numerically disastrous for nearly singular kernels. Approach 2 instead uses brilliant inverse-free algebraic trick. By analytically tracking pseudo-residuals (𝑉𝑘 = 𝐾 𝐷𝑘 and 𝑍𝑘 = 𝐾𝑍𝑘), the 𝐾 1 inversion perfectly cancels out. 37 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously This elegant tracking reduces the bottleneck to just one dense kernel multiplication per iteration (𝑀𝑘 = 𝐾𝑈𝑘). Drawback: Implicitly tracking variables via recurrence relations accumulates floatingpoint drift over time, forcing the algorithm to periodically refresh its state. 2.4.

Final Verdict Approach 1 (Pre-Aggregated) is practically superior for large-scale, real-world datasets. By shifting the computational burden to the setup phase (computing 𝐸 (𝑖) ), it achieves an iteration cost that is entirely independent of the dataset size 𝑞. If your dataset has millions of observations, Approach 2 will bottleneck hard. Furthermore, its Block-Jacobi preconditioner is much more robust choice for CP tensor models, meaning it will likely require far fewer total iterations to converge. Approach 2 (Inverse-Free) is mathematically elegant and better suited for lightweight setups or huge ranks. Its inverse-free tracking is beautiful piece of numerical linear algebra that bounds the kernels condition number without requiring any (𝑛3) matrix factorizations or explicit inversions. It is highly advantageous if memory is critically constrained, setup time must be strictly minimized, or the CP rank 𝑟 is so large that Approach 1s (𝑛𝑟3) Cholesky factorizations become computationally prohibitive. 3. Approach 1: Pre-Aggregated Geometry & Block-Jacobi Preconditioner 3.1. Pre-computation and Data Setup To strictly avoid (𝑀) operations, we completely abandon the explicit formulation of 𝑍. The 𝑚-th observation only requires its corresponding row in the Khatri-Rao product, 𝑧 (𝑚) = (𝑍 𝑗𝑚,:)𝑇 ℝ𝑟. This vector is computed cleanly as the Hadamard product of the respective rows of the 𝑑 1 fixed factor matrices in (𝑑𝑟) time. We precompute these 𝑞 vectors in (𝑞𝑑𝑟) time, bypassing the ambient dimension 𝑀. We capture the unaligned data geometry by defining 𝑛 independent symmetric matrices 𝐸 (𝑖) ℝ𝑟𝑟 corresponding to the 𝑛 slices of mode 𝑘. Let Ω𝑖 = {𝑚 Ω 𝑖𝑚 = 𝑖} be the set of observations falling in the 𝑖-th slice. We construct: 𝐸 (𝑖) = 𝑚Ω𝑖 𝑧 (𝑚) (𝑧 (𝑚) )𝑇 , for 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑛. (3) The RHS matrix 𝐶 ℝ𝑛𝑟, such that vec(𝐶) = 𝑐, is computed completely sparsely. Since the tensor unfolding 𝑇 has missing entries set to zero, 𝐵𝑖,: = (cid:205)𝑀 𝑦𝑚 (𝑧 (𝑚) )𝑇 . We 𝑗=1 compute 𝐵 in (𝑞𝑟) time and evaluate 𝐶 = 𝐾 𝐵 in (𝑛2𝑟) time. 𝑇𝑖, 𝑗𝑍 𝑗,: = (cid:205)𝑚Ω𝑖 3.2. Exact Matrix-Vector Product (MVP) avoiding (𝑁) 38 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously During PCG, we must map an intermediate matrix 𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟 to residual mapping 𝑉 ℝ𝑛𝑟 such that vec(𝑉) = vec(𝑊). Theorem 1 (Implicit Operator Action). For any 𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟, the mapping 𝑉 ℝ𝑛𝑟 such that vec(𝑉) = vec(𝑊) evaluates exactly as: 𝑉 = 𝐾𝑌 + 𝜆𝑈, (4) where 𝑈 = 𝐾𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟 and the 𝑖-th row of 𝑌 ℝ𝑛𝑟 is uniquely determined by 𝑌𝑖,: = 𝑈𝑖,:𝐸 (𝑖) . This requires strictly (𝑛2𝑟 + 𝑛𝑟2) time, completely independent of 𝑞, 𝑀, and 𝑁. Proof. By the Kronecker-vector identity vec( 𝐴𝑋 𝐵) = (𝐵𝑇 𝐴) vec(𝑋), applying the first term evaluates as (𝑍 𝐾) vec(𝑊) = vec(𝐾𝑊𝑍𝑇 ) = vec(𝑈𝑍𝑇 ). The operator 𝑆𝑆𝑇 ℝ𝑁 𝑁 is exactly sparse diagonal projection mask spanning the unaligned data entries. When applied to vec(𝑈𝑍𝑇 ), it zeros out all unobserved tensor entries. Let the unvectorized masked matrix be 𝐹 ℝ𝑛𝑀. Its elements are identically zero everywhere except at the 𝑞 observed multi-indices, where they evaluate to: 𝐹𝑖𝑚, 𝑗𝑚 = (𝑈𝑍𝑇 )𝑖𝑚, 𝑗𝑚 = 𝑈𝑖𝑚,:𝑍𝑇 𝑗𝑚,: = 𝑈𝑖𝑚,:𝑧 (𝑚) . Next, applying the left operator (𝑍 𝐾)𝑇 = (𝑍𝑇 𝐾) yields vec(𝐾𝐹𝑍). Let 𝑌 = 𝐹𝑍 ℝ𝑛𝑟. Because 𝐹 is sparse, the 𝑖-th row of 𝑌 expands strictly over the non-zeros in the 𝑖-th slice: 𝑌𝑖,: = 𝑀 𝑗=1 𝐹𝑖, 𝑗𝑍 𝑗,: = 𝑚Ω𝑖 𝐹𝑖𝑚, 𝑗𝑚 𝑍 𝑗𝑚,: = 𝑈𝑖,:𝑧 (𝑚) (cid:17) (cid:16) (𝑧 (𝑚) )𝑇 = 𝑈𝑖,: 𝑚Ω𝑖 𝑚Ω𝑖 𝑧 (𝑚) (𝑧 (𝑚) )𝑇 = 𝑈𝑖,:𝐸 (𝑖) . Finally, multiplying by 𝐾 completes the main term yielding vec(𝐾𝑌 ). The regularization term simplifies seamlessly: 𝜆 (𝐼𝑟 𝐾) vec(𝑊) = vec(𝜆𝑈). Summing the components validates 𝑉 = 𝐾𝑌 + 𝜆𝑈. 3.3. Preconditioner Design: Row-wise Block-Jacobi Theorem 2 (Exact Block-Diagonal Operator). Let 𝑀 (𝑖) ℝ𝑟𝑟 denote the exact 𝑖-th diagonal block of the Hessian operator acting linearly on the 𝑖-th row of 𝑊 (represented as column vector). It evaluates exactly as: 𝑀 (𝑖) = 𝑛 𝑙= 𝑖,𝑙 𝐸 (𝑙) + 𝜆 𝐾𝑖,𝑖 𝐼𝑟. 𝐾2 (5) Since 𝐸 (𝑙) 0, 𝐾2 𝑖,𝑙 0, and RKHS kernels satisfy 𝐾𝑖,𝑖 0, the resultant blocks are positive semi-definite, and symmetric positive definite for any 𝜆 > 0, allowing for computation of the 𝑖 . The sum (cid:205)𝑙 𝐾2 𝐸 (𝑙) can be rapidly evaluated in (𝑛2𝑟2) Cholesky-like factorization 𝑀 (𝑖) = 𝐿𝑖 𝐿𝑇 operations via flattened dense matrix multiplication. 𝑖,𝑙 Algorithm 1: PCG for Unaligned RKHS Mode-𝑘 Subproblem (Approach 1) 1: Initialize Setup: Calculate 𝑍Ω ℝ𝑞𝑟, {𝐸 (𝑖) }𝑛 2: Preconditioner: Construct 𝑀 (𝑖) via flat multiplication, and compute decomposition 𝐿𝑖 𝐿𝑇 𝑖=1, and 𝐶 = 𝐾 𝐵 ℝ𝑛𝑟. 𝑖 = 𝑀 (𝑖) for 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑛. 3: 𝑊0 = 0𝑛𝑟, 𝑅0 = 𝐶, and 𝑍0 ℝ𝑛𝑟. 4: for 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑛 do Solve 𝐿𝑖 𝐿𝑇 𝑖 (𝑍0)𝑇 5: 6: end for 𝑖,: = (𝑅0)𝑇 𝑖,: { Apply Preconditioner Block-wise} 39 Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously 7: 𝑃0 = 𝑍0 8: for 𝑘 = 0, 1, 2, . . . until 𝑅𝑘 𝐹 < 𝜏 do 9: 11: 10: 𝑈 = 𝐾𝑃𝑘 Compute 𝑌𝑖,: = 𝑈𝑖,:𝐸 (𝑖) for all 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑛 𝑉𝑘 = 𝐾𝑌 + 𝜆𝑈 { Exact fast MVP defined in Theorem 1} 𝛼𝑘 = Tr(𝑅𝑇 12: 𝑘 13: 𝑊𝑘+1 = 𝑊𝑘 + 𝛼𝑘 𝑃𝑘 𝑅𝑘+1 = 𝑅𝑘 𝛼𝑘𝑉𝑘 14: for 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑛 do Solve 𝐿𝑖 𝐿𝑇 𝑍𝑘)/Tr(𝑃𝑇 𝑘 𝑖 (𝑍𝑘+1)𝑇 𝑖,: = (𝑅𝑘+1)𝑇 𝑖,: 𝑉𝑘) 15: 16: 17: 18: end for 𝛽𝑘 = Tr(𝑅𝑇 𝑃𝑘+1 = 𝑍𝑘+1 + 𝛽𝑘 𝑃𝑘 𝑘+1 𝑍𝑘+1)/Tr(𝑅𝑇 𝑘 𝑍𝑘) 19: 20: end for 21: return 𝑊𝑘+1 4. Approach 2: On-the-fly Sparse Accumulation & Kernel Preconditioner 4.1. Algebraic Reformulation of the Linear System The linear system to solve for 𝑊 ℝ𝑛𝑟 is vec(𝑊) = 𝑏. Using the mixed-product property of Kronecker products, ( 𝐴 𝐵)(𝐶 𝐷) = ( 𝐴𝐶) (𝐵𝐷), we can factor 𝑍 𝐾 = (𝑍 𝐼𝑛)(𝐼𝑟 𝐾). Let 𝑃 = 𝐼𝑟 𝐾. Substituting this factorization and setting 𝐻red = (𝑍 𝐼𝑛)𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑇 (𝑍 𝐼𝑛), we seamlessly rewrite the exact system as: (𝑃 𝐻red𝑃 + 𝜆 𝑃) vec(𝑊) = 𝑃 vec(𝐵) (6) 4.2. Method and Choice of Preconditioner We select 𝑃 = 𝐼𝑟 𝐾 as our preconditioner. Without preconditioning, the system matrix can be illconditioned, especially for certain RKHS kernels with decaying eigenvalues. By preconditioning with 𝑃, the effective operator is normalized to 𝑃1/2 𝐻red𝑃1/2 + 𝜆 𝐼𝑛𝑟. The condition number becomes mathematically bounded regardless of the kernel spectrum: 𝜅 𝜆 + 𝜆max( 𝐻red)𝜆max(𝐾) 𝜆 = 1 + 𝜆max( 𝐻red)𝜆max(𝐾) 𝜆 (7) The Inverse-Free Tracking Technique: Standard PCG evaluates 𝑧𝑘 = 𝑃1𝑟𝑘 at every iteration, seemingly requiring an intractable (𝑛3) inversion of 𝐾. However, note that the right-hand side 𝑏 = 𝑃 vec(𝐵) is in the range of 𝑃, and the operator 𝑃( 𝐻red𝑃 + 𝜆 𝐼) always maps vectors into the range of 𝑃. By induction, the residual 𝑟𝑘 intrinsically factors as 𝑟𝑘 = 𝑃ˆ𝑟𝑘. Therefore, the preconditioned residual is exactly 𝑧𝑘 = ˆ𝑟𝑘. By analytically updating ˆ𝑟𝑘 instead of 𝑟𝑘, 𝑃1 perfectly algebraically cancels out. 4.3. Matrix-Free Matrix-Vector Products (Sparse Operations) We evaluate 𝑈 = unvec( 𝐻red vec(𝑉)) in (𝑞𝑟) time by bypassing 𝑁 and 𝑀. 1. Apply (𝑍 𝐼𝑛): Conceptually expands the model to the full unaligned grid. 2. Apply Sparse Selection 𝑆𝑇 : Extract the 𝑞 observed entries. For observation 𝑚, the predicted value is (𝑉 𝑍𝑇 )𝑖𝑚, 𝑗𝑚 = 𝑉𝑖𝑚,:, 𝑧𝑚. We compute these 𝑞 scalars 𝑒𝑚. 3. Apply Adjoint 𝑆 and (𝑍𝑇 𝐼𝑛): The output 𝑈 sparsely accumulates the entries where the mode-𝑘 index matches 𝑖: 𝑈𝑖,: = (cid:205)𝑚:𝑖𝑚=𝑖 𝑒𝑚𝑧𝑚.
