Existing benchmarks [11, 38, 44] primarily measure\nthe recall-speed trade-off against ground truths derived solely from\ndistance metrics (e.g., Euclidean or Inner-Product). These synthetic\nmetrics abstract away from task semantics, ignoring application-\nspecific labels or utility, and thereby obscure how retrieval qual-\nity propagates to downstream outcomes, leading to a disconnect\nbetween academic evaluations and practical deployment criteria.\nIn our preliminary analysis from a task-centric view, we identify\na long-overlooked pitfall in VSS, termed the Information Loss\nFunnel, which helps explain why high-synthetic recall retrieval\ndoes not necessarily guarantee strong end-task performance, as\nillustrated below:",
            "content": "1 SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Tingyang Chen, Cong Fu, Jiahua Wu, Haotian Wu, Hua Fan, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yabo Ni, and Anxiang Zeng Figure 2: The main contribution of Iceberg. Detailed information on the datasets and methods is provided in 3, while the construction of the decision tree and the computation of meta-features are described in 4. Example 1. Figure 1 contrasts widely used synthetic metric (synthetic recall@100) with downstream-aware measure (label recall), on two public datasets. Synthetic Recall@100 evaluates how close the retrieved vectors to query in terms of distance (e.g., Euclidean or Inner Product), whereas label recall measures the fraction of those 100 retrieved items whose class or identity label matches the query. On Glint360K-ViT for face recognition (left), NSG [27] attains 99% synthetic recall@100 faster than RaBitQ [31], yet achieves only 90% label recall and does so more slowly than RaBitQ. This divergence reveals that superior synthetic recall need not translate to better task effectiveness. The ImageNet classification case (right) is even more dramatic: with Euclidean distance, synthetic recall@100 and label recall track closely, but under inner-product distance, synthetic recall@100 soars to 99.9% while label recall collapses below 1%. In other words, the index returns almost exclusively wrong-class images despite an ostensibly ideal benchmark score, demonstrating that conventional recalllatency evaluations can be entirely misleading for real-world tasks with mismatched metric. These findings demonstrate that optimizing synthetic recall metrics alone neither ensures improved task-level performance nor reveals the most appropriate similarity measure. We trace the mismatch to three-stage Information Loss Funnel: Layer 1. Embedding Loss: Mapping raw data to fixed-length vectors inevitably discards fine-grained information. Hence, vector proximity does not always align with task-specific utility. Layer 2. Metric Misuse: Applying generic distance measure that poorly matches the geometry of the learned embeddings can amplify errors, especially when the embedding model is trained with complex objectives [26, 35] beyond pure metric learning [34, 41]. Layer 3: Distribution Sensitivity: VSS methods differ in how they balance recall vs. latency under varying data distributions. Choosing an index that 2 lacks robustness to the specific vector distribution in use can incur significant degradation in both throughput and end-task accuracy. However, most public benchmarks probe only the third layer, leaving the funnels upper stages untested. To remedy this oversight, we introduce Iceberg, holistic, task-centric benchmark suite that exposes the hidden pitfalls of VSS evaluation and guides future algorithmic development. Iceberg makes continuous and tightly integrated set of contributions. It first introduces the informationloss funnel, which exposes critical yet overlooked issues in the existing literature. It then provides suite of benchmarks with newly labeled datasets that empirically validate this model. Building on these analyses, it further proposes selection method that operationalizes the frameworks insights, enabling end users to make task-aligned algorithmic choices. Finally, it highlights promising directions for bridging the gap between academic research and industrial practice. The main contributions of Iceberg are summarized as follows and visualized in Figure 2: (1) Information Loss Funnel: Fine-Grained Diagnostic Model. We introduce the Information Loss Funnel, three-layer framework that systematically diagnoses why vector similarity search methods fail to deliver on task-level objectives. By in-depth examining (1) Embedding Loss, (2) Metric Misuse, and (3) Distribution Sensitivity, our model unifies disparate research threads under common taxonomy. This layered perspective not only reveals hidden failure modes masked by synthetic benchmarks but also guides researchers toward the most impactful optimization targets. (2) Comprehensive Task-centric Evaluation Benchmark. To assess and validate the diagnostic model, we release broad benchmark suite spanning eight diverse datasets from four representative end-application domains image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and large-scale recommendation each with Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Table 1: Comparison of Iceberg with state-of-the-art vector similarity search benchmarks. \"Scale\" denotes the size of the benchmark datasets. \"Embedding Model\" indicates the advancement level of the models employed by the benchmark. \"Funnel Scope\" indicates whether the benchmark provides comprehensive analysis of the information loss funnel. \"Domain\" specifies which similarity search problem the benchmark focuses on. \"Downstream Utility\" indicates whether the benchmark considers the effectiveness of downstream tasks. \"Explainability\" refers to whether the method rankings provided by the benchmark are interpretable for users to select appropriate methods.

We evaluate 13 leading VSS methods (covering tree-, hashing-, clustering-, and graph-based) on both Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) [10, 21, 27, 31, 39, 51, 59] and Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) [17, 18, 33, 50, 53, 71]. Iceberg reports not only synthetic recall and throughput but also downstream utility measured by label recall@K, hit@K, and matching score@K (detailed in 3). Our results reveal substantial re-rankings compared to the traditional distance-only leaderboards, offering more faithful guide for real-world deployments. Moreover, we develop an extensible pipeline that facilitates the integration of future tasks. (3) Explainable Decision Tree for Method Selection. Leveraging the Information Loss Funnel model and extensive experimental analyses on benchmark datasets, we develop lightweight, transparent decision-tree toolkit that maps dataset characteristics to suitable VSS methods. We identify easy-to-compute meta-features such as clustering tightness, vector norm distributions, angular separations, and distance contrast that correlate strongly with end-task performance. They form the decision nodes of our tree, enabling practitioners to rapidly extract them from any dataset and traverse the tree to determine the optimal VSS indexing and search strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public toolkit linking data traits directly to VSS method choices in task-centric manner. (4) Insights of Future Direction. Analysis of the Information Loss Funnel highlights three promising paths to bridge the gap between benchmarks and applications: (1) Task-Aware VSS: Jointly optimizes indexing and searching strategies with downstream objectives in mind; (2) Metric-Aware VSS: Automatically select, combine, or desensitize similarity metrics to accommodate embedding learned under complex, non-metric losses; and (3) DistributionAware VSS: Dynamically adapt the index structures and retrieval strategies to heterogeneous data distribution, e.g., skewed densities or segmented user behavior, to sustain both accuracy and efficiency. Roadmap. 2 reviews previous related works and background. 3 provides detailed description of the datasets, end tasks, methods, and overviews the design philosophy behind Iceberg. 4 raises the research questions, then provides comprehensive analysis based on the experimental outcomes of Iceberg, and outlines the future directions. 5 discusses the implications and limitations of Iceberg. 6 concludes this paper."

            "content": "3 SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Tingyang Chen, Cong Fu, Jiahua Wu, Haotian Wu, Hua Fan, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yabo Ni, and Anxiang Zeng First, in terms of dataset scale and embedding quality, ANNBenchmarks is constrained to relatively small, legacy datasets (e.g., SIFT1M, GLOVE1M) derived from outdated embedding models (e.g., Eigen decomposition, GoogLeNet). As result, these datasets fail to capture the complexity and semantic richness of modern applications. Big-ANN-Benchmarks and BigVectorBench represent progress by adopting larger-scale datasets and incorporating more recent embedding techniques. MTEB incorporates more advanced embedding modelsincluding LLM-based onesand focuses on evaluating the representation quality of different embeddings. However, its dataset scale is relatively small. Second, regarding evaluation scopespecifically funnel coverage and metric domain, all four benchmarks focus almost exclusively on ANNS and assess only limited portions of the information-loss funnel. MTEB is limited to Layer 1 (Embedding Loss), contrasting vectors from different representation models on common task. It normalizes by default and disregards similarity-metric selection and distribution-dependent retrieval variance. The remaining benchmarks probe only Layer 3 (Distribution Sensitivity), neglecting the impacts derived from other layers. Moreover, they offer no evaluation for MIPS, despite its prevalence in recommendation and ranking systems. Third, existing benchmarks provide minimal or no support for task-level utility analysis (e.g., classification accuracy, recommendation hit-rate) and lack tools to explain why one method outperforms another in given downstream context. Consequently, these benchmarks center on synthetic recall under chosen metric. While this contributes to evaluation in some respects, users gain little actionable guidance for selecting methods aligned with their application objectives. Iceberg addresses these deficiencies by spanning both ANNS and MIPS, employing large-scale, modern embeddings, and integrating end-to-end task utility assessment. Crucially, it delivers full-funnel coverage including embedding fidelity and metric alignment probes and an explainable decision tree that maps dataset meta-features to recommended methods. This holistic approach empowers practitioners to diagnose failure modes, interpret performance trade-offs, and make informed choices tailored to their specific workloads."

            "content": "In these practical applications, industrial practitioners are not only concerned with the trade-off between synthetic recall and query throughput (QPS), but also prioritize realistic downstream task-centric metrics that reflect the true utility of the VSS system. Different applications have different goals for downstream tasks from vector similarity search. For image classification, the main concern is whether the returned images reflect the true query class, which is in favor of large scale image labeling and recognition. In face recognition, an important downstream task is to recall identity vectors corresponding to the query, prioritizing accuracy for security and payment. In text retrieval, operations involve determining whether query can recall semantically relevant passages, measuring content matching accuracy. Recommendation system metrics Figure 3: Benchmark Pipeline. assess if item embeddings reflect users preference for items and if they emphasize high-relevance, popular items like bestsellers, for the purpose of conversion and personalization. Despite the ubiquity of synthetic benchmarks (e.g., synthetic recall@K), these metrics can diverge sharply from task objectives mismatch we attribute to the Information Loss Funnel. By evaluating VSS methods against both synthetic and realistic task-centric metrics across diverse applications, Iceberg reveals where and why high synthetic recall may fail to deliver real-world effectiveness."

            "content": "(1) Image Classification. Image classification serves as canonical use case for vector-based retrieval, aiming to align the knowledge representation of images with human conceptual understanding. The goal of VSS is to retrieve visually and semantically similar images for downstream tasks that align with human perception. Data Collection. We use the ImageNet dataset [1] as the representative benchmark for image classification. This large-scale dataset contains 1,000 object categories, with 1,281,167 training images and 50,000 validation images, each annotated with ground-truth labels. Due to its broad coverage and widespread adoption in the computer vision community, ImageNet remains standard resource for training and evaluating image classification models. End Task Design. The image category annotations are treated as task-specific labels. An essential criterion for assessing whether the retrieved vectors satisfy the needs of the downstream task is the 4 Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Table 2: Overview of benchmark datasets Task Image Classification Face Recognition Text Retrieval Recommendation Dataset ImageNet-DINOv2 ImageNet-EVA02 ImageNet-ConvNeXt ImageNet-AlexNet Glint360K-ViT Glint360K-IR101 Data Num Dim Embedding Model Task-specific Label Task-centric Metrics 1,281,167 1,281,167 1,281,167 1,281,167 17,091,649 17,091,649 DINOv2 [55] EVA02 [24] ConvNeXt [70] AlexNet [40] ArcFace-IR101 [22] ArcFace-ViT [22] Label Recall@K Label Recall@k Label Recall@K Label Recall@K Label Recall@K Label Recall@K Image Class Image Class Image Class Image Class Identity ID Identity ID 768 1024 1536 4096 512 512 BookCorpus 9,250,529 1024 Stella_en_1.5B_v Paragraph ID Hit@K Commerce 99,085,171 48 ResFlow [26] Item ID Matching Score@K consistency between the labels of the retrieved images and that of the query. Thus, we define Label Recall@K as task-centric metric. Label Recall@K. It measures how many correct task-specific labels appear in the top-K retrieved results. It captures the fraction of retrieved vectors whose task-relevant labels match the querys label, providing practical measure of downstream task performance. Equation 1). This metric effectively captures the degree of identity match and serves as reliable task-centric measure. Embedding Generation. To emphasize the architectural diversity of the models, we selected representative backbones from both the CNN [3] and ViT [2] paradigms, and employed Arcface, leading method specifically designed for face recognition, during training. Label Recall@𝐾 = 1 𝐾 𝐾 𝑖=1 (𝐿(𝑅𝑖 ) = 𝐿(𝑞)) (1) where is the set of queries, 𝐿(𝑥) is label function to get label for vector 𝑥, () is an identity function returning 1 if input statement holds and 0 otherwise, and 𝑅𝑖 means the 𝑖th vector in the retrieved vector set 𝑅 with size 𝐾. Embedding Generation. Image embedding models are rapidly advancing with diverse representation strategies. To compare the impact of different models on the embedding space and downstream tasks, we evaluate representative state-of-the-art (leading methods in terms of classification accuracy under different research venues) backbone models: DINOv2 [5], EVA02 [6], ConvNeXt [4]. Furthermore, we used an old embedding model, AlexNet [40]. We did not include it in the major experiments, but rather used it to compare old and modern embeddings, illustrating how representation shifts affect downstream performance. (2) Face Recognition. Face recognition is specialized and highly important visual retrieval task, with widespread applications in areas such as security and payment. Unlike general visual classification, it demands extremely fine-grained accuracy to differentiate between individuals. The goal of VSS is to retrieve vectors corresponding to the same identity as the query face. Data Collection. We adopt the open-source Glint360K dataset [7] as the representative benchmark for face recognition. This large-scale dataset contains over 17 million images spanning 360,232 identities, curated from public sources and annotated via combination of manual and automated methods. For query construction in Iceberg, we randomly sample one face image per identity, with the first 20,000 identities used as the test set. End Task Design. The identity ID corresponding to each face embedding is used as the task-specific label. Although the granularity of the tasks differs, face recognition and image classification share the same task-centric evaluation metric: Label Recall@K (refer to (3) Text Retrieval. Text retrieval is critical problem in VSS, especially in the era of LLMs, where it plays central role in RAG frameworks to mitigate hallucinations commonly observed in generative models. In text retrieval, the goal of VSS is to retrieve the text passages that best match given query sentence, serving as an external knowledge source to provide relevant information. Data Collection. We use cleaned version of the open-source BookCorpus dataset, which contains text from approximately 19,000 books across diverse domains. The corpus was segmented into 9,250,529 paragraph-level chunks, each formed by concatenating eight sentences. From this collection, 10,000 paragraphs were randomly selected to extract the query set. End Task Design. The unique ID of each paragraph was used as the label. The text dataset is composed of semantically independent passages, each paired with query generated to reflect its topic. We use Hit@K as the task-centric metric. Hit@K. This metric measures whether the most semantic relevant paragraph is included in the top-K retrieved results. Such selfretrieval task is commonly used in downstream text applications, such as duplicate content detection. Hit@𝐾 = 1 q (𝐿(q) {𝐿(r) 𝑅(q)}) (2) where is queries set, 𝐿(𝑥) is label function to get label for vector 𝑥, () is an identity function returning 1 if input statement holds and 0 otherwise, 𝑅(q) denotes the top-𝐾 retrieved vectors for q. Embedding Generation. Since the transformer-based, pretrain & finetune paradigm has dominated this text embedding training literature, we employed Stella [9] as our text embedding model. This model is tailored for complex text semantic representation and is distilled from larger, high-performing architecture (i.e., Qwen2 [14]). It generates 1024-dimension vectors and exhibits strong representational capacity on standard text embedding benchmarks [54]. 5 SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Tingyang Chen, Cong Fu, Jiahua Wu, Haotian Wu, Hua Fan, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yabo Ni, and Anxiang Zeng Table 3: Summary of benchmark VSS methods.

(4) Recommendation Recommendation is key application area for VSS. In this setting, VSS is used to retrieve itemssuch as products, content, or servicesthat are both semantically relevant to users preferences and aligned with broader popularity trends. fundamental goal of retrieval in recommendation systems is to balance personal relevance with item popularity. Data Collection. The Commerce dataset, derived from anonymized traffic logs of major e-commerce platform, serves as representative benchmark for large-scale E-commerce systems. Collected over several months, the dataset comprises 99,085,171 records of frequently purchased grocery items. In addition, query set of 64,111 real user requests was constructed to summarize user profiles and associated intent keywords. Each query is annotated with set of items with which the users show high preferences, enabling evaluation on downstream recommendation tasks. End Task Design. We use the hit of user preferred Item IDs as labels for Commerce. In this task, VSS is required to retrieve vectors that are both relevant and popular. Thus, we use Matching Score@K as task-centric metric. Matching Score@K. It is used to evaluate downstream utility on the Commerce dataset. Because there are usually multi hits for each user, we use the cumulative score of those hits. This metric aligns with practical e-commerce objectives by promoting accurate and relevant product recommendations. Matching Score@𝐾 = 𝑖 𝑅 (q) (𝐿(𝑖) (q)) 𝑃 (𝐿(𝑖)) (3) Embedding Generation. We used ResFlow, pre-trained personalized deep retrieval model [8], to generate 48-dimensional embeddings, size chosen to balance performance and resource limitations in E-commerce platform. Unlike many high-dimensional datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality [20, 48], Commerce exhibits an intrinsic dimension nearly equal to its actual dimension, rendering high information compression rate."

            "content": "O1 (Embedding Process): Information loss first occurs during the transformation from raw data to embeddings. This loss can untie the semantic similarity with spatial closeness under given distance metrics, making the pursue for high synthetic recall meaningless. Our experiments reveal consistent gap between synthetic metrics and true downstream task performance. First, as shown in Table 4, we observe that downstream utility (label recall@100) exhibits natural upper bound, even when synthetic recall approaches 100%. For instance, on the ImageNet dataset with SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Tingyang Chen, Cong Fu, Jiahua Wu, Haotian Wu, Hua Fan, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yabo Ni, and Anxiang Zeng Table 4: Label Recall@100 on selected benchmark datasets. The corresponding synthetic recall@100 is set to 99%. IP denotes Inner Products and ED is Euclidean distance.

This indicates that high VSS synthetic accuracy does not necessarily translate into better task performance. Second, on the Commerce dataset, we find non-monotonic relationship between synthetic metrics accuracy and downstream task-centric utility (Figure 5). As synthetic recall improves, the matching score@100a task-specific measure of user interestinitially increases but then declines. This counterintuitive trend shows that relying too heavily on synthetic measures without considering their practical implications can lead to misleading conclusions. Finally, Table 5 shows that downstream task-centric utility is highly sensitive to the choice of embedding model. Using DINOv2, EVA02, ConvNeXt, and AlexNet on ImageNet, we observe significant differences in label recall@100 under the same retrieval setting (all with 99% synthetic recall). While DINOv2 achieves only 71%, EVA02 and ConvNeXt reach 85% and 84%, respectively. Furthermore, representations from the old embedding model diverge more from task-centric retrieval targets. AlexNet-based embeddings achieved only about 21% accuracy on label recall, suggesting that neglecting downstream evaluation on outdated embeddings leads to increasingly misaligned and less meaningful retrieval results. We attribute this phenomenon to information loss in the representation space, which is closely related to concepts such as neural collapse [57] and representation collapse [19, 43]. Such representation collapse reflects an Occams razor principle: the model will only retain information useful for predicting the labels. However, in many domains of machine learning, the optimization objective of the model doesnt always facilitate metric-preserving projection over the whole sample space. For example, classification loss only fits the training data to the training labels, suffering from generalization errors to test space. Contrastive learning aligns the metric structure of extracted vectors among selected positive and negative samples (usually applying in-batch sampling), not the whole sample Figure 5: Comparison between synthetic and task-centric matching score on Commerce Dataset. space. After training on dataset, different amount of information will be lost according to different loss design, needless to say the model capacity. To focus on VSS, we dont aim to propose solutions to this problem and leave it to the machine learning community. O2 (Metric Choice): The second layer of the information loss funnel is metric misuse, critical issue in real-world applications where inappropriate similarity metrics for VSS render even high synthetic recall ineffective for task-centric gains. This issue is prevalent and often overlooked when evaluating VSS systems solely based on synthetic metrics. Figure 6 shows the trend of task-centric performance as synthetic recall varies on representative datasets, using the best-performing methods from both the ANNS and MIPS domains. Figure 6 reports results across four datasets: ImageNet-EVA02, ImgeNet-ConvNeXt, BookCorpus, and Glink360-IR101, demonstrating how the similarity metric choice radically impacts downstream task-centric performance. On ImageNet, with ConvNeXt embeddings, ANNS using Euclidean distance scores roughly 4% higher label recall@100 than MIPS, even though both are run at synthetic recall@100 around 99.9%. The problem is more pronounced with the EVA02 model: even though MIPS achieves nearly perfect synthetic recall@100 (99.99%), actual task-centric label recall@100 is stubbornly below 1%, reflecting near-complete semantic mismatch. Analogously, on the text retrieval dataset BookCorpus, MIPS manages less than 50% task-centric hit recall, whereas Euclidean-based ANNS attains 100%. However, the Glink360-IR101 dataset shows the opposite. Here, MIPS comfortably outperforms Euclidean-based ANNS on task-centric metrics: with Glink360K-IR101 embeddings, MIPS performs 98% label recall@100, whereas HNSW (ANNS methods) tops out at 92%. Given the high-stakes nature of applications such as identity verification, such performance discrepancies result in critical system failureseven with high synthetic recall. These differences in performance are due to mismatched similarity measures and embedding space geometries, controlled through loss design and metric affinity. Models such as ConvNeXt are trained with cross-entropy loss, which promotes embeddings within the same class to have tight clusters in Euclidean space. Euclidean distance naturally captures this structure. By contrast, MIPS is sensitive to both direction and norm of vectors and does not respect this clustering, retrieving semantically unrelated neighbors despite high synthetic recall. Glink360K-IR101 embeddings are trained with ArcFace, which employs an Additive Angular Margin Loss to foster highly discriminative angular structuresmall intra-class angles Reveal Hidden Pitfalls and Navigate Next Generation of Vector Similarity Search from Task-Centric Views SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Figure 6: Comparison of downstream task-centric performance under different similarity metrics. Figure 7: Experimental results of query performance for synthetic metric recall on four representative datasets. and large inter-class angles. This structure is naturally captured by inner product similarity, and thus MIPS is the correct choice and we see why it has superior task-centric performance on Glink360. Combined, these results highlight an important takeaway: Evaluating synthetic recall with single similarity metric (like Euclidean distance) can be misleading and, unless that metric is aligned with the training loss, largely meaningless. Metric choice materially affects outcomes: metric misuse not only incurs drastic information loss but also can make high-synthetic recall VSS systems functionally useless in real-world downstream tasks. O3 (Data Distribution Sensitivity): Each data distribution has methods best suited to its properties or structures, and choosing an unsuitable method can cause retrieval efficiency to drop and result in information loss, contributing the third layer of information loss funnel. We categorize the methods into two classespartition-based and graph-based methods (3.2 for details)and conduct extensive evaluations on four datasets from different domains for both ANNS and MIPS tasks. The experimental results are presented in Figure 7. O-3.1: Partitionand graph-based methods have their own strengths. In traditional benchmarks [11, 67], it is commonly assumed that graph-based methods significantly outperform other types of methods in in-memory settings. This belief has led many commercial vector search systems to prioritize graph-based methods by default (e.g., AnalyticDB [68]), regardless of the application. However, this assumption does not always hold true. VSS methods efficiency heavily relies on the data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate query performance on synthetic metric. As shown in Figures 6, the partition-based methods exhibit clear performance advantage in certain datasets, particularly on the ImageNet-DINOv2 and Glink360K-IR101. In the MIPS setting, ScaNN significantly outperforms the leading graph-based method on these datasets, achieving speedups of 1.7 and 3, respectively, while maintaining comparable synthetic metric recall. similar advantage is observed in the ANNS setting: on Glink360K-IR101, RaBitQ delivers nearly 2 faster query speed than HNSW at equivalent synthetic metric recall. In contrast, graph-based methods perform better on BookCorpus and Commerce. In the MIPS experiments on synthetic metric, the top-performing graph-based index achieves up to 3 faster speed than ScaNN on Commerce, and up to 4 on BookCorpus. similar trend is seen in the ANNS setting: HNSW outpaces the strongest partition-based competitor, RaBitQ, by 2.7 and 3.2 on BookCorpus and Commerce, respectively. 9 SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Tingyang Chen, Cong Fu, Jiahua Wu, Haotian Wu, Hua Fan, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yabo Ni, and Anxiang Zeng Table 5: Comparison of task-centric performance (label recall@100) across different models on ImageNet dataset. Model HNSW RaBitQ Synthetic Recall@100 99% 95% 90% Synthetic Recall@100 99% 95% 90% AlexNet DINOv2 EVA02 ConvNeXt 21.62% 21.48% 21.43% 22.55% 22.43% 22.41% 71.24% 70.5% 71.2% 71.08% 71.17% 70.08% 84.9% 84.4% 83.7% 80.1% 84.76% 84.82% 83.46% 83.46% 83.54% 83.3% 82.7% 82.5% The performance differences are attributed to the sensitivity of the methods to data properties. For example, when shapes in the data are strongly cluster-like, graph-based methods are liable to get trapped in local optima among clusters, which discourages them from finding the relevant areas [61]. Similarly, when angles between vectors are large, edge pruning methods based on the triangle inequality (e.g., HNSW, NSG) increasingly fail to sparsift the graph while maintaining connectivity. Partition-based methods are inherently dependent on data characteristics as well: whether they use clustering or hash-based projections, their quality can significantly vary from one dataset to another [29]. O-3.2: Wrong choice leads to performance degradation. Beyond the query speed disparities on synthetic metric, the impact of selecting an unsuitable method is more criticalit can constrain synthetic metric recall and downstream task-centric performance, ultimately causing significant information loss. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the domain of MIPS. Due to the lack of rigorous theoretical foundations, some methods suffer from synthetic metric recall bottlenecks and performance degradation on certain datasets. For example, while the Mobius algorithm performs well on some datasets (e.g., BookCorpus), it fails to exceed 50% accuracy on synthetic metric recall@100 on the Glink360K-IR101 dataset. Similarly, partition-based methods such as ScaNN exhibit noticeable performance drops on the Commerce dataset when the target synthetic metric recall exceeds 90%. These findings highlight that variations in data distribution can lead to different degrees of information loss across methods. Information Loss Funnel Analysis. Having identified the information loss funnels layered structure through extensive analysis, we qualitatively assess each layers contribution. Layer 1 (Embedding loss) defines the upper bound of task-centric performance, as the transformation from raw data to embeddings inevitably discards fine-grained semantics. Layer 2 (Metric misuse) exerts decisive impact on retrieval accuracy, where metric misalignment undermines the correlation between synthetic recall and task-centric metric. Layer 3 (Distribution sensitivity) primarily shapes retrieval efficiency, though its impact on task-centric metrics, albeit smaller, remains non-trivial. Overall, the first two layers dominate taskcentric accuracy, while the third governs computational scalability. We now revisit key VSS applications information loss within this evaluation framework. Image Classification. Layer 1: Image classification models, both supervised and self-supervised, extract representations but do not 10 achieve perfect task-centric accuracy due to data complexity and model limitations  (Table 5)  . Layer 2: Representations in image classification tasks tend to align well with Euclidean space, as their embedding models are typically trained with cross-entropy loss, which encourages embeddings of the same class to form compact clusters in Euclidean space. Layer 3: Different methods show inconsistent performance between synthetic and downstream tasks, leading to information loss in method selection. Face Recognition. Layer 1: ArcFace-based models may encounter task-centric accuracy ceiling in downstream tasks due to architectural constraints on representation learning  (Table 4)  . Layer 2: Inner product metrics are better suited for face recognition due to the use of Additive Angular Margin Loss, which promotes discriminative angular structure. Layer 3: Graph-based methods are more prone to local optima than partition-based methods, reducing their effectiveness on synthetic metric tasks (Figure 7). Text Retrieval. Layer 1: Current text representation models exhibit some distortion when extracting information from paragraphs. Layer 2: Incorrect metric choice, such as inner product, can reduce task-centric Hit@K performance to under 50% (Figure 6). Layer 3: Due to the difficulty in distinguishing boundary points, partitionbased methods are more prone to information loss in synthetic task retrieval than graph-based methods. Recommendation. Layer 1: ResFlow struggles to strongly correlate synthetic and task-centric tasks, leading to significant information loss (Figure 5). Layer 2: Euclidean distance and inner product metrics show an initial performance improvement followed by decline in downstream tasks, because models are trained on historical useritem interactions, user vectors nearest items are typically those already purchased; with repurchases rare, optimizing for such neighbors yields limited real-world benefit. Layer 3: Partition-based methods suffer retrieval performance degradation in synthetic metrics (Figure 7)."

This choice is critical as it directly impacts the downstream task-centric utility. Given the discussion in 4.2, the embedding model domain evolves fast and usually does not offer clues on how is the affinity of their method with downstream retrieval tasks. However, with exhaustive research, we manage to capture affinity patterns between data distribution property or structure with different metrics used for VSS. Our decision rule for metric selection is based on the combined assessment of the DBI and CV as follows. Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI): DBI measures cluster compactness and separation in the embedding space; lower values indicate better clustering quality and can be computed using either Euclidean distance (DBI𝐸) or cosine similarity (DBI𝐶 ). DBI = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖= 𝜎𝑖 + 𝜎 𝑗 𝑑 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑐 𝑗 ), max 𝑗𝑖 (5) where 𝑁 denotes the number of clusters, 𝜎𝑖 denotes the intracluster distance of cluster 𝑖, 𝑐𝑖 and 𝑐 𝑗 denote cluster centers, and 𝑑 (𝑐𝑖, 𝑐 𝑗 ) denotes the distance between cluster centers. Coefficient of Variation (CV): It quantifies embedding vector norm variability; lower CV indicates more consistent norms. This is typical in training with norm normalization (e.g., contrastive learning), which mitigates the impact of vector norms on model behavior. CV = 𝜎 (𝑥 )/E(𝑥 ). (6) Here 𝜎 (𝑥 ) is the standard deviation of vector norms. E(𝑥 ) is the mean norm over the dataset. The datasets opt for IP as the similarity metric when the condition (𝐷𝐵𝐼𝐸 𝐷𝐵𝐼𝐶 ) 𝐶𝑉 0.1 is satisfied. This condition suggests that clusters in the embedding space are more distinguishable in angular terms than in Euclidean space, and that the embedding vectors exhibit relatively uniform norms. This distribution prioritizes angular information, indicating semantic similarity and supporting MIPS more effectively, meaningfully retaining taskrelevant details downstream. Our findings corroborate this: on the Glint360K-IR101 dataset (𝐷𝐵𝐼𝐸 = 5.51, 𝐷𝐵𝐼𝐶 = 2.09, 𝐶𝑉 = 0.08), IP achieves 4% higher label recall@100 compared to ANNS, which is notable boost for face recognition. Otherwise, we opt for Euclidean distance instead. In that case, the data has more Euclidean clustering, and high CV indicates there is large norm variation in 11 O5 (Second Layer: Selecting Algrithm): Our second layer thus chooses the best VSS method for an embedding space and chosen similarity metric. Mainstream VSS engines predominantly employ either partition-based or graph-based methods, which differ significantly in their strategies. However, method choice is connected to information loss and data distribution structures too. Our decision rule is subject to RA and RC. Relative Angle (RA): It measures the average angular relationships between embedding vectors, where larger RA value indicates greater angular dispersion within the dataset. RA = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 arccos (cid:18) v𝑖 v𝑖 + 𝜖 (cid:19) (7) where v𝑖 is an embedding vector from the dataset of 𝑁 vectors, 𝑖=1 v𝑖 is the global mean vector, and 𝜖 is small positive = 1 𝑁 constant for numerical stability. (cid:205)𝑁 Relative Contrast (RC): It measures datasets relative density in high-dimensional space; higher values suggest more dispersed distribution. RC = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝐷 𝑣𝑖 mean 𝐷 𝑣𝑖 min (8) min represents the distance from vi to its approximate mean is the mean distance from vi to Here, 𝐷 𝑣𝑖 nearest neighbor, and 𝐷 𝑣𝑖 vectors (random sampled) in dataset. The datasets favor partition-based methods when the condition RA 60 RC 1.5 is met. Both RA and RC play critical roles in determining the search navigability of graph-based indexing methods. low RA indicates strong cluster segregation, leading to poor global connectivity in the graph and causing searches to get stuck in local optima. High angular dispersion further weakens triangle inequality pruning, degrading proximity graph quality. Similarly, low RC suggests that local neighbors have similar distances, reducing structural discriminability and diminishing the effectiveness of graph-based guidance during search. In such conditions, partition-based methods perform more efficiently. By detecting spatial divisions in the data, they restrict computation to relevant regions during querying and benefit from batch processing. As shown in Figure 6, on the Face-IR101 dataset (RA = 87, RC = 1.38), ScaNN achieves 3 lower query latency than the state-of-the-art graph-based method ip-NSW, while maintaining comparable synthetic recall. Conversely, graph-based methods excel when RA is high and RC is moderate. Better connectivity and sparsity enable effective edge pruning, and the power-law structure of the graph allows greedy search to traverse efficiently. high RC improves search quality by reducing redundancy and enhancing guidance. For instance, HNSW outperforms RaBitQ by 3.7 in query speed on the BookCorpus at synthetic recall@100 = 0.95. Threshold analysis. Our distribution-related threshold conclusions are supported by diverse datasets and reported under the confidence interval lower bound, which provides strong tolerance and generalizability. For example, (CVIP = [0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.00]) yielded 95% upper confidence bound of 0.1019, whereas the ED SIGMOD26, 2026, Bengaluru, India Tingyang Chen, Cong Fu, Jiahua Wu, Haotian Wu, Hua Fan, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yabo Ni, and Anxiang Zeng Table 7: New Method Leaderboard on Iceberg 1.0.

In some cases, instances with the same label are located relatively far from the query. The right part presents global statistical view, revealing that notable portion of queries fail to exhibit wellaligned distance-label relationships. These observations suggest that further development of task-aware VSS is promising. Future Direction. Given the diversity of real-world applications, future work should focus on developing adaptable, task-aware VSS techniques that generalize across models and tasks while minimizing system overhead. For example, to address this issue, we can incorporate VSS method with task-aware early-stop strategy where label-recall saturates or focus the search within task-aware proximity range. more promising future work is to co-optimize indexing and search methods with downstream tasks in mind.

Such synergistic design is particularly important in complex, large-scale AI applications. O8 (Metric-aware Improvement): Metric-aware VSS is breakthrough approach to enhancing VSS performance. Iceberg has identified the link between similarity metrics and downstream task effectiveness. However, most existing methods are tailored to single metric, limiting their adaptability. Recent work such as the MAG [17] demonstrates initial progress by supporting both IP and NN within single index, enabling cross-metric retrieval and improving the usability of VSS. Nevertheless, these methods still rely on manual tuning and cannot fully bridge the geometric differences across metric spaces. Future Direction. key future direction for VSS is developing metricaware methods that can adapt to various similarity spacesinner product, Euclidean, and non-Euclideanwithout manual tuning. As embedding objectives and architectures grow more diverse and model training does not necessarily indicate which distance metric should be used, fixed-metric approaches become increasingly suboptimal. Overcoming this \"metric barrier\" calls for self-adaptive methods capable of automatically identifying and adjusting to the appropriate similarity metric. While MAG marks early progress, their reliance on manual tuning and limited support for complex metrics highlights the need for more flexible solutions, especially given their performance gap with metric-specific methods like ScaNN on certain datasets. O9 (Distribution-aware Improvement) The heterogeneous pattern distributions of diverse vector datasets inherently challenge traditional VSS methods that rely on fixed construction strategies. Such methods have poor generalizability to datasets with varied geometric properties. For example, in the Glink360K dataset, as shown in Figure 9(left), K-means clustering is performed in the original space, followed by PCA methods for 3D visualization, where data points are separated by cluster labels. The dataset showcases extreme angular separation: inter-class distances are large, while intra-class distances have high variability, thus severely crippling the usefulness of graph-based indices. For the BookCorpus dataset, an analogous dimensionality reduction method was used, with the data points colored according to their 13 Figure 9: Visualization of data distributions: Left Glink360K-ViT dataset; Right BookCorpus dataset. norms. Figure 9(right) shows that the average angle between vectors is kept within 60 degrees, and the data is scattered along multiple norm directions. In such scenarios, graph-based methods can effectively leverage the triangle inequality for pruning edges. However, partition-based approaches struggle to create clear boundaries between partitions, making it difficult to exactly identify border points. This limitation negatively impacts their ability to achieve high synthetic metric recall efficiently. Future Direction. key direction for future research lies in designing distribution-aware VSS methods that can adapt to the geometric characteristics of data. Since we can identify effective statistical indicators to divide different methods into different nodes of the decision tree (Figure 2), this means the current design of VSS methods \"overfit\" certain data distribution and metric. Thus, this literature may eagerly expect the emergence of \"cross-node\" VSS methods. Although some research efforts have proposed hybrid methods that combine graph and clustering techniques [16], such approaches are predominantly heuristic and lack concrete guidelines and adaptive mechanisms across diverse datasets. This highlights significant optimization opportunities, from automatically tuning index parameters and adaptively stitching methods to achieving fully dynamic and distribution-sensitive VSS mechanisms."

            "content": "Lessons Learned. We summarized three key lessons. Lesson 1: Optimizing only for synthetic is insufficient since information is progressively lost across the VSS pipeline, and method improvements often fail to yield task-centric gains. End-to-end evaluation is essential to bridge the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world effectiveness. Lesson 2: Metric misuse and suboptimal method choices are major, yet avoidable, sources of information loss. better understanding of embedding distributions can guide more effective alignment between models, metrics, and retrieval strategies. Lesson 3: Current VSS methods remain relatively isolated in the end-to-end pipeline and lack dynamic optimization tailored to real-world scenarios. There is untapped potential in developing task-aware, metric-aware, and distribution-aware retrieval strategies that dynamically adapt to real-world deployment needs.

This study highlights hidden pitfalls in current retrieval methods and their implications for the future VSS, while leaving some aspects beyond its scope. (1) Euclidean distance and inner product (cosine as special case) cover most needs while hyperbolic [28] and sparse embeddings introduce alternative metrics such as Mahalanobis distance, these remain niche directions. Given limited resources, we focus on representative tasks and will extend to such customized metrics as new needs arise . (2) It focuses on algorithmic characteristics rather than commercial system optimizations like cloud-native design or hardware heterogeneity. (3) Information loss from upstream machine learning is acknowledged as critical issue, but no solution is proposedits flagged as key area for future work. (4) The decision tree model in Iceberg is built on current AI-generated vectors, which may lead to \"overfitting\" as model landscapes evolve, necessitating ongoing updates, i.e., the meta-feature indicators and dividing thresholds may evolve with the literature development. As AI applications rapidly advance, future updates will incorporate emerging domains such as LLM-based agents, guided by the release of high-quality benchmark datasets."

            "title": "6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we presented Iceberg, a comprehensive benchmark\nsuite explicitly designed for end-to-end evaluation of vector sim-\nilarity search (VSS) from task-centric perspectives, which shifts\nthe focus from synthetic evaluation to the downstream task perfor-\nmance. Our study identifies the information loss funnel as the pri-\nmary bottleneck in VSS and systematically analyzes its underlying\ncauses through extensive experimentation. For empirical valida-\ntion, Iceberg integrates eight large-scale datasets across four major\ndomains, eight domain-specific representation models, thirteen\nstate-of-the-art VSS methods, four downstream task metrics, and\na variety of variations. To assist practitioners, it further provides\nan explainable decision-tree model that guides practitioners in se-\nlecting task-appropriate VSS methods. Finally, we summarize our\nfindings and outline directions for future research, aimed at closing\nthe gap between academic research and production deployments.",
