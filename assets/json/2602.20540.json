Keywords: Container Dwell Time, Generative AI, Machine Learning, Port Logistics, Smart Port 1. Introduction Container shipping accounts for more than 50% of global maritime trade, and container ports function as critical hubs linking maritime and inland transportation (Xie et al. 2025). Major ports worldwide handle hundreds of millions of containers annually, playing an essential role in the smooth functioning of global supply chains (Xie et al. 2017). Accordingly, container terminals responsible for unloading and storing containers have developed and implemented various methodologies to improve yard management efficiency (Filom et al. 2022; Kourounioti et al. 2016; Park et al. 2026). Among these methodologies, accurately identifying container dwell time (CDT) is widely recognized as an important process for enhancing container handling efficiency (Chhetri et al. 2024). Containers handled at ports are generally classified into three types: import, export, and transshipment (Irannezhad et al. 2019). For export and transshipment cargo, CDT can be calculated based on scheduled vessel arrival times (Gaete G. et al. 2017; Rodriguez-Molins et al. 2012). Accordingly, operators establish stacking strategies in their daily operational decisions, such as placing containers scheduled for loading in marshalling yards close to berthing locations or stacking them in advance at upper tiers (Kourounioti et al. 2016). These practices are regarded as core processes for efficient container terminal operations, as they can reduce vessel handling time and decrease the number of relocations performed by yard cranes (De Armas Jacomino et al. 2021; Maldonado et al. 2019). In contrast, for import containers unloaded from vessels, the arrival time of the pickup truck transporting the container is not known in advance (Ku and Arthanari 2016; Saurí and Martín 2011), making import container dwell time (ICDT) difficult to identify. This uncertainty poses major constraint on the effective application of various yard operation strategies. Consequently, many studies have treated ICDT as prediction problem, primarily employing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (Chhetri et al. 2024; Gaete G. et al. 2017; Kourounioti et al. 2016; Saini and Lerher 2024). However, existing studies suffer from key limitation: they fail to effectively utilize cargo information (CI), which refers to the items contained in containers, and owner information (OI), which denotes the owners of those itemsboth of which are key determinants of ICDT (Hassan and Gurning 2020). These variables are recorded in unstructured textual form and cannot be directly used in ML models. Instead, relevant information must be manually interpreted and categorized according to standard classification systems by experts. Such manual standardization processes are time-consuming and costly, rendering information extraction highly impractical in operational settings (Xie et al. 2025). Nevertheless, transforming high-dimensional, unstructured port data into meaningful features has been consistently emphasized as prerequisite for the effective application of AI in port logistics (Chung 2021; Filom et al. 2022). To address these challenges, generative AI (Gen AI) has recently emerged as promising technology. Owing to its advanced language understanding capabilities, Gen AI can interpret unstructured text and convert it into standardized systems, enabling large-scale data standardization without expert-driven manual efforts (Li et al. 2024). This capability allows unstructured information previously unconsidered in existing studies to be effectively represented and integrated into ML models. Accordingly, this study proposes collaborative framework that leverages Gen AI to standardize OI and CI and integrates the standardized outputs into an ICDT prediction model. Through this framework, the impact of adopting Gen AI on both prediction performance and terminal productivity is empirically evaluated. In addition, the predicted results are applied to container stacking strategies, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify actual reductions in the number of yard crane relocations. The main contributions of this study are threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use Gen AI for standardizing unstructured data in the port logistics domain, thereby extracting key ICDT determinantsthe OI and the CI. Second, the standardized information is integrated into ML models, and state-of-the-art performance is demonstrated through experiments based on real container terminal data. Third, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is quantitatively validated by demonstrating reductions in the number of yard crane relocations achieved through ICDT-informed stacking strategies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related studies on ICDT prediction and AI-based standardization. Section 3 proposes collaborative framework that integrates Gen AI and ML for ICDT prediction. Section 4 analyzes the relationship between Gen AI-based standardization results and ICDT. Section 5 evaluates the improvement in ICDT prediction performance achieved by incorporating standardized results into ML models. Section 6 compares the number of yard crane relocations through simulations that apply ICDT prediction to container stacking strategies. Section 7 provides an in-depth discussion of the technical and methodological implications and limitations of the proposed framework. Finally, Section 8 summarizes the research findings and presents directions for future research. 2. Literature Review"

            "content": "2 In studies on ICDT prediction, unstructured data such as OI and CI are recognized as key factors affecting dwell time; however, systematic methodologies for incorporating them into ML models remain insufficient. Early studies primarily attempted to address this issue through manual categorization. Kourounioti et al. (2016) noted the lack of attention to ICDT prediction and argued that accurate ICDT estimation is essential for enabling yard planners to stack containers in manner that facilitates the retrieval of those with high pickup probability. To this end, they converted unstructured CI into eight categories (e.g., edible, sensitive edible, chemicals, and plastic) and applied an artificial neural network, demonstrating that the categorized CI contributes to improved ICDT prediction performance. Similarly, Aminatou et al. (2018) proposed normalizing CI into three categories based on value density (monetary value per kilogram) and reported that cargo type and value density are closely related to ICDT. However, the generalizability of this approach remained limited, as the categorization relied on subjective, value-based criteria. De Armas Jacomino et al. (2021) analyzed and used product informationwhich is similar to CIinto ICDT prediction models. However, the practical deployability of their approach was unclear, as it was not explicitly stated whether the information was preprocessed by experts or could be automatically obtained in advance. Subsequent studies expanded the set of considered variables and sought to improve model interpretability. Lee et al. (2024) incorporated external factors that had not been considered previouslysuch as strikes and weather conditionsto reduce uncertainty in ICDT prediction and applied eXplainable AI techniques to analyze the influence of each variable. Although this study broadened the variable scope, it acknowledged that directly utilizing OI and CI may be more important and thus did not fully resolve the fundamental challenge. Akodia et al. (2024) included proxy variables that indirectly represent CI and OI, such as the trucking company and container value density. However, transforming these variables using one-hot encoding into high-dimensional vectors led to an excessive increase in the number of categories, resulting in overfitting and increased computational complexity. common limitation across these studies is the semantic loss and limited generalizability that arise when converting unstructured data into structured representations. Overcoming these limitations requires transforming unstructured information into standard classification system that can preserve its meaning effectively while maintaining manageable number of categories. Against this background, recent studies have attempted to automatically convert unstructured CI into standard codes using AI techniques. Xie et al. (2025) proposed extracting semantic information from CI using GloVe word embeddings and matching it to the Standard International Trade Classification code. They reported up to 6% improvement in predictive accuracy for binary classification task that determines yard locations in an intermodal terminal, demonstrating the potential benefits of standardizing unstructured data. However, word-embeddingbased approaches cannot distinguish contextual meanings of the same word or handle out-of-vocabulary terms, abbreviations, and technical jargon specific to the port logistics domain that are absent from the training data. Addressing these issues requires building and continuously updating domain-specific vocabulary, which demands substantial resources and domain expertise. Consequently, while the work by Xie et al. (2025) represents pioneering attempt to automatically extract semantic information from unstructured data, it suggests that more advanced AI techniques are necessary to comprehensively handle the non-standardized notation practices and heterogeneous rules observed in real-world operational data. Methodological improvements in this direction are practically important, as improvements in ICDT prediction performance can directly translate into enhanced terminal operations. Accurate ICDT prediction provides essential information for establishing container stacking strategies and can effectively reduce the number of relocations required during terminal operations. Gaete et al. (2017) proposed stacking strategy that assigns containers with similar dwell-time groups to adjacent locations based on ICDT prediction results, demonstrating reduction in inefficient relocations. Maldonado et al. (2019) developed heuristic methodology that determines container stacking positions based on predicted ICDT, empirically showing that this strategy can significantly reduce relocations in real container terminals. De Armas Jacomino et al. (2021) formulated ICDT prediction as an ordinal regression problem and reported that this approach not only improves prediction performance but also maximizes relocation reduction when applied to stacking strategies. Therefore, improving ICDT prediction performance by effectively handling unstructured information can directly contribute to enhancing terminal operational efficiency."

            "title": "2.2 Standardization of CI and OI",
            "content": "Due to the unstructured nature of CI and OI, many studies have attempted to standardize them using ML and AI techniques. CI is text-based data type that describes imported items and their contents, and it is recorded in various forms depending on the data source, such as cargo descriptions and trade declarations. He et al. (2021) proposed an ML framework to automate Harmonized System (HS) code standardization in the customs trade 3 declaration process. In that study, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was used to extract semantic features from text and classify the HS codes. However, they reported that standardization accuracy degrades substantially depending on data quality. Zhou et al. (2022) pointed out that structured product description is often ambiguous and lacks continuous context, which complicates classification, and proposed framework based on convolutional neural networks. Sasana et al. (2025) compared traditional ML-, deep learning (DL)-, and natural language processing-based methods for HS code standardization. They identified several persistent challengessuch as short and ambiguous text descriptions, severe class imbalance, and formatting errorsthat can lead to substantial errors. These studies commonly emphasized that classification performance is highly sensitive to data quality and that enhanced data preprocessing and robust handling of linguistic variations are essential for accurate classification. To overcome these limitations, recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs) for HS code classification (Marra De Artiñano et al. 2023). This study showed that LLMs can outperform conventional ML models without complex data preprocessing. However, its generalizability is limited, as it was evaluated only within the agriculture, fisheries, and food domain. In contrast, OI is typically recorded as few words representing the name of the importing entity, which provides limited information about the firms industry sector or business activities. Consequently, prior studies have attempted standardization by integrating additional information rather than directly using OI. Wood et al. (2017) extracted textual data from companies official websites and developed model to classify North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes using Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and multilayer perceptron. They reported severe noise in the training data and extreme imbalance in the amount of data across industries as key limitations. Oehlert et al. (2022) performed feature extraction by applying TF-IDF to business activity descriptions and tax filings and classified NAICS codes using random forest model. They noted that their approach was suitable only for specific time periods and administrative datasets, resulting in limited generalizability, and that the characteristics of ML models made it difficult to identify clear reasoning process behind the standardization results. To address these limitations, recent studies have introduced language models that can capture linguistic characteristics. For instance, Jagrič and Herman (2024) employed BERT to classify business descriptions into industry categories, demonstrating the potential of language models to perform industry classification by understanding textual semantics. However, their approach required extensive prior data collection and did not consider re-training issues arising from linguistic variation or generalizability to other data sources. Existing studies that aim to standardize CI and OI share several common limitations. First, because they adopt supervised learning, they require the construction and maintenance of large-scale pre-labeled training datasets. Second, the resulting models often exhibit limited generalizability, as they are effective primarily for data originating from the same source or domain as the training data. Third, the lack of interpretability in standardization outputs prevents post-hoc handling. These limitations significantly reduce deployability in container terminal environments, where standardization must be performed immediately when an import container is unloaded, without additional resources or personnel, and where the reasoning behind the outputs must be verifiable. From this perspective, Gen AI represents suitable alternative for container terminal environments. Leveraging extensive pre-trained knowledge, Gen AI can perform standardization directly from given inputs without complex preprocessing or the construction of training datasets, thereby offering high generalizability. Moreover, when information is insufficient, it can perform web searches in human-like manner to augment the information required for reasoning, even from limited short text. Furthermore, by providing the reasoning behind the standardization outputs, Gen AI enables interpretation and response. Building on this review, this study standardizes OI and CI using Gen AI and integrates the standardized information into an ICDT prediction framework. 3. Collaborative Framework for ICDT Prediction"

HS code: The HS code is an international commodity classification system developed by the World Customs Organization and is currently used by more than 200 countries as the basis for tariff imposition and trade statistics (World Customs Organization, 1988). It provides six-digit base structure, which individual countries further subdivide according to their tariff policies and statistical requirements. In this study, the two-digit hierarchical structure is defined as Standardization Levels 13 and is standardized using Gen AI. Korean Standard Industrial Classification (KSIC code): For OI standardization, the KSIC code is adopted. It is national standard classification system established by Statistics Korea to systematically categorize economic activities based on the similarity of industrial activities. It is designed based on the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification while reflecting the industrial structure of Korea, and is used for economic policy formulation and industrial statistics (Statistics Korea, 2017). Since the present study focuses on the Port of Busan, the KSIC code was adopted. However, depending on the geographical location of the container terminal, it can be replaced with the most appropriate industrial classification system. The KSIC code is hierarchically structured into one alphabetic character, two-digit numeric codes, and three-digit numeric codes, and is standardized into Levels 13 in the same manner as the HS code."

Both CI and OI are standardized by Gen AI into common hierarchical structure with three levels (Levels 13). In addition, to enable Gen AI to assess whether the input information is sufficient for standardization, the Validation Check field returns Type-1 (valid) when standardization is feasible, Type-2 (insufficient) when the information is inadequate, and Type-3 (invalid) when standardization is not possible. The basis for this assessment is briefly described in the Reason field. For CI, an additional Evidence Tokens field records the keywords that play decisive role in the standardization process. This design enhances the explainability of the Gen AIbased standardization and enables the identification of improperly recorded data, thereby facilitating post hoc actions through discussion with domain experts. In contrast, OI is often recorded as short text consisting of one to three words, such as company names, which makes semantic interpretation difficult. This characteristic poses significant challenge for standardizing OI using Gen AI alone. Accordingly, when Gen AI determines that the given OI cannot be sufficiently identified based solely on its pre-trained knowledge, it is instructed to collect additional information through web search. Furthermore, since ICDT may vary with the size of the owning firm, even for the same cargo, Size field is included to classify owner size for subsequent analysis."

To this end, Standardization Bank (STD Bank) is designed to store standardized results and reuse them when identical input information reappears, thereby minimizing repeated Gen AI calls. The operational mechanism of the STD Bank is presented in Algorithm 1 in the form of pseudocode. Although the algorithm is described with respect to CI, the same structure is applied to OI.

If no such result is found, prompt 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡𝐶𝐼𝑟𝑎𝑤 is generated and provided as input to the Gen AI module, as 6 described in Appendices 1 and 2. The standardized output returned by Gen AI is then updated in the STD Bank and defined as 𝐶𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑑. Subsequently, when the same 𝐶𝐼𝑟𝑎𝑤 is encountered repeatedly, the previously standardized result 𝐶𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑑 is retrieved directly from the STD Bank and returned without invoking Gen AI. Through this caching mechanism, redundant requests for identical 𝐶𝐼𝑟𝑎𝑤 are avoided, and as the number of stored 𝐶𝐼𝑟𝑎𝑤 entries in the STD Bank increases, the frequency of Gen AI calls is progressively reduced. 3.2 Prediction Layer This subsection describes the input variables used in the prediction model. It also explains the process of redefining ICDT in response to the occurrence of electronic data interchange (EDI) events and predicting the updated ICDT. 3.2.1 Basic Variables When an import container is unloaded from vessel, various types of information become available. Among them, the variables that can be directly input into the ML model are presented in Eq. (1).

(16) represents the ICDT predicted by 𝜙𝐼𝑁 at the moment when an import container is unloaded (i.e., at time 𝑡𝐼𝑁). At this stage, since no EDI state has been updated, X𝐸𝐷𝐼 is not utilized. The predicted 𝐼𝑁 is regarded as the current ICDT of the container, denoted by 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐, until an EDI state update occurs 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 (Eq. 17). 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 𝐼𝑁 = 𝜙𝐼𝑁(𝑋𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒, 𝑋𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 𝐼𝑁 ) (16) (17) At time 𝑡𝑒, when an EDI state is updated (i.e., CR or CP), the corresponding container is already located in the 𝑒 and updates storage yard, and only its operational status changes. As shown in Eq. (18), 𝜙𝑒 re-predicts 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 (Eq. 19). The rationale for re-predicting ICDT according to EDI states is to effectively capture changes in the ICDT distribution associated with state transitions. This process terminates once the container departs from the terminal. 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 𝑒 = 𝜙𝑒(𝑋𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒, 𝑋𝑠𝑡𝑑 , 𝑋𝐸𝐷𝐼), 𝑒 {𝐶𝑅, 𝐶𝑃} 𝑒 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 𝐼𝐶𝐷𝑇𝑐 4. Gen AIBased Standardization of OI and CI"

Since identical OI and CI may appear across multiple containers, deduplication was performed, and Gen AI standardization was executed only once. Focusing first on the KSIC standardization results, among the 22,271 cases classified as Type-1, only one case (0.004%) at Level-1 and three cases (0.013%) at Level-2 were identified as non-matched. At the most fine-grained level (Level-3), 921 cases (4.14%) were classified as non-matched. For Type-2, out of 669 cases, non-matched results were observed only at Level 3, amounting to 31 cases (4.63%). In contrast, for Type-3, approximately 95% of the 994 cases were identified as non-matched across all levels. This indicates that Gen AI can reliably identify cases that are not suitable for standardization. similar trend is observed in the HS Code standardization results. Among the 106,775 Type-1 cases, nonmatched results were observed only at Level-3, accounting for 3,671 cases (3.44%), while all cases at the Level1 and Level-2 classifications were correctly matched. For Type-2, which consists of 6,190 cases, non-matched results accounted for 4,748 cases (76.70%) at both Level-1 and Level-2 and increased to 5,898 cases (95.28%) at Level-3. Type-3 cases were extremely rare, with only four instances observed, in contrast to the OI results. This difference can be attributed to the fact that CI, even when recorded in highly abbreviated form, typically contains some cargo-related information, which Gen AI recognizes as insufficient for standardization, leading to Type-2 classification rather than Type-3. In summary, the low proportion of non-matched cases in Type-1 demonstrates that when Gen AI determines standardization to be feasible, it assigns valid standard codes. Conversely, the high non-matched ratios observed in Type-2 and Type-3 indicate that Gen AI accurately identifies cases with insufficient information or those unsuitable for standardization. These results demonstrate that the proposed self-validation mechanism can effectively determine the standardizability of input information prior to standardization. 11 4.3 ICDT Distribution by Standardized Categories This subsection analyzes differences in ICDT according to the standardization results of KSIC and HS Codes. For this purpose, four high-frequency categories at Level-1 were first selected, and up to three subcategories were extracted from each of them. For these categories, the proportion of observations and the empirical ICDT distributions are presented, together with the results of independent t-tests to indicate statistical significance. The overall results of this analysis are summarized in Fig. 2. Figure 2. ICDT Distribution Based on Standardization Result From the KSIC analysis, the most frequently standardized Level-1 categories were (Manufacturing), (Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing), (Transportation and Storage), and (Accommodation and Food Service). Within category (Manufacturing), the identified subcategories were C14 (Manufacture of tobacco products), C27 (Manufacture of medical products), and C12 (Manufacturing of wearing apparel), which exhibited ICDT values of 54.29, 65.30, and 89.86 h, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed among these subcategories. Category (Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing) consisted of two subcategories: A03 (Fishing and aquaculture) and A01 (Agriculture), with corresponding ICDT values of 45.69 and 80.21 h. For category (Transportation and Storage), three subcategoriesH50 (Water transport), H52 (Warehousing and support activities), and H49 (Land transport)were identified, whereas category (Accommodation and Food Service) consisted of two subcategories, I56 (Food and beverage service activities) and I55 (Accommodation). At Level2, the KSIC standardization results exhibited statistically significant differences across all analyzed categories. The HS Code analysis revealed that the most frequently standardized Level-1 categories were 04 (Dairy produce; eggs; honey), 11 (Products of the milling industry), 33 (Essential oils, perfumery, cosmetics), and 87 (Vehicles other than railway). Within category 04 (Dairy produce; eggs; honey), the subcategories 0401 (Milk and cream, not concentrated nor containing added sugar), 0406 (Cheese and curd), and 0402 (Milk and cream, concentrated or containing added sugar) exhibited ICDT values of 36.45, 40.71, and 61.01 h, respectively. For category 11 (Products of the milling industry), the subcategories 1101 (Wheat or meslin flour), 1102 (Cereal flours other than of wheat or meslin), and 1103 (Cereal groats, meal, and pellets) showed ICDT values of 58.50, 118.53, and 133.84 h, respectively, indicating substantial differences in ICDT even within the same parent category. In category 33 (Essential oils, perfumery, cosmetics), relatively shorter ICDT values were observed, with 3302 (Mixtures of odoriferous substances) at 35.25 h, 3304 (Beauty or make-up preparations and preparations for the care of the skin) at 44.26 h, and 3306 (Preparations for oral or dental hygiene, including denture fixative pastes and powders) at 68.34 h. Finally, within category 87 (Vehicles other than railway), the subcategories 8703 (Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons), 8707 (Bodies (including cabs), for motor vehicles), and 8711 (Motorcycles and cycles fitted with an auxiliary motor) exhibited ICDT values of 47.05, 59.62, 12 and 84.27 h, respectively. All of these differences were statistically significant, demonstrating that Gen AIstandardized results constitute important variables that explain variations in ICDT. 4.4 Interactive Effects of Standardized OI and CI on ICDT Although OI and CI are standardized independently by Gen AI, their combination may reveal additional heterogeneity in ICDT. To examine this hypothesis, this study analyzes how ICDT distributions vary within Level2 HS Codes according to owner size, as classified by Gen AI. For this purpose, the top 100 Level-2 HS Codes with the largest sample sizes were identified, and representative codes from this set were selected for independent t-tests. The results are presented in Fig. 3. SMEs denote small and medium-sized enterprises as classified by Gen AI based on owner-related information. Figure 3. ICDT Distribution Based on HS Code and Size Class For HS Code 0202 (Frozen bovine meat), large proportion of owners were classified as Unknown, and ICDT values appeared similar regardless of owner size. Although statistical significance was observed for limited number of combinations, most comparisons did not exhibit significant differences. This suggests that for perishable goods such as frozen meat, rapid departure is essential due to product characteristics, thereby limiting the influence of owner size on ICDT. In contrast, for HS Codes 2309 (Animal feed preparations), 2916 (Unsaturated acyclic monocarboxylic acids), 6802 (Worked monumental/building stone), and 8483 (Transmission shafts, gears, and bearings), consistent pattern emerged in which larger owner size was associated with shorter ICDT and reduced variance in the distribution. In particular, comparisons between large firms and SMEs exhibited strong statistical significance across all cases. This pattern suggests that larger owners tend to operate standardized 13 logistics processes and adhere to more clearly defined departure schedules. Conversely, SMEs exhibited greater dispersion in ICDT, likely due to their smaller representation and greater variability in departure timing across individual firms. By contrast, HS Code 8708 (Motor vehicle parts) exhibited different pattern, with SMEs showing shorter ICDT than large firms, deviating from the trends observed for the other product categories. In summary, when product characteristicssuch as perishabilityprimarily determine the speed of departure, the effect of owner size on ICDT is limited. However, for certain product categories, statistically significant differences in ICDT by owner size are observed. These results demonstrate that OI and CI play important roles in explaining ICDT not only individually but also in combination, indicating that the two sources of information exhibit complementary characteristics. 5. ICDT Prediction Experiments This section analyzes the impact of Gen AIgenerated standardization results on the performance of ICDT prediction models and identifies models that achieve state-of-the-art performance. 5.1 Experimental Settings The training dataset consists of two years of data collected from an operational container terminal at Busan port between 2024 and 2025, comprising 394,386 records. In consultation with domain experts, records with ICDT values exceeding 10 days were excluded from the training process. The variables used in the experiments are summarized in Section 3.2.3. Tree-based ML models that are commonly adopted in ICDT prediction studies namely eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CAT), which is known for effectively modeling high-cardinality categorical variableswere selected for evaluation (Chen and Guestrin 2016; Ke et al. 2017; Prokhorenkova et al. 2018). These models have been widely reported to outperform DL models on tabular data over an extended period (Grinsztajn, Oyallon, and Varoquaux 2022; Shwartz-Ziv and Armon 2022). In addition, DL models specialized for tabular data processingFTTransformer (FTT), Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), and TabNetwere included for comparison (Arik and Pfister 2021; Gorishniy et al. 2021; Popov, Morozov, and Babenko 2020). Finally, baseline model that predicts the mean ICDT value was adopted to benchmark the performance improvements achieved by the advanced models. 𝑀𝐴𝐸 = 1 𝑛 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 𝑦𝑖 𝑖 (20) To evaluate ICDT prediction performance, mean absolute error (MAE) was adopted, as it directly represents the absolute difference between predicted and observed values in units of time (Eq. 20). MAE has been widely used as an evaluation metric in prior ICDT prediction studies (De Armas Jacomino et al. 2021). For both KSIC and HS Codes, Level-3 standardized results were used. To enhance the generalizability of the experimental results, the test dataset was randomly sampled at ratios of 20%, 30%, and 40% of the full dataset. Each experiment was repeated 10 times, and the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics were reported."

DL modelsincluding FTT, NODE, and TabNetexhibited consistently inferior performance across all test ratios and EDI states. In particular, for the CP-state, the average MAE of the DL models reached 2.911, corresponding to 16.30% performance degradation compared to the mean-value baseline. This observation is consistent with prior studies that have reported the limitations of DL models in extracting meaningful information from tabular data (Grinsztajn et al. 2022; Shwartz-Ziv and Armon 2022). In contrast, treebased ML models demonstrated substantially better performance. XGBoost achieved MAE values of 42.113, 29.931, and 2.096 for the IN-, CR-, and CP-states, respectively, while LightGBM reported 38.652, 27.214, and 2.067. CAT, which is specifically designed to handle categorical variables, achieved MAE values of 38.613, 26.913, and 2.033, consistently outperforming the benchmark models across all test ratios and EDI states. These results indicate that the characteristics of the datasetparticularly the large number of categorical variablesare better captured by tree-based ML models. In experiment (b), which incorporates the standardization results, DL models did not exhibit noticeable performance improvements compared to experiment (a). In contrast, the ML models showed consistent performance gains in most cases. For XGBoost, MAE values improved from 42.113, 29.931, and 2.096 in experiment (a) to 37.470, 27.981, and 2.116 in experiment (b), corresponding to performance improvements of 11.02% and 6.52% for the INand CR-states, respectively, although slight degradation of 0.95% was observed for the CP-state. LightGBM improved from 38.652, 27.214, and 2.067 to 34.144, 24.243, and 1.999, achieving performance gains of 11.66%, 10.92%, and 3.29% across all EDI states. CAT achieved the largest improvements, with MAE values decreasing from 38.613, 26.913, and 2.033 in experiment (a) to 33.253, 23.710, and 1.892 in experiment (b), corresponding to improvements of 13.88%, 11.90%, and 6.94%, respectively. Notably, CAT achieved the best overall performance both with and without standardization results and also exhibited the largest improvement margins. Overall, these results indicate that the standardized information provides limited improvements for DL models, whereas it consistently enhances the performance of tree-based ML models. In addition, the effect of the standardization level of OI and CI on ICDT prediction performance was analyzed. To isolate the impact of standardization granularity, the CAT modelwhich achieved the best performance in the 15 previous experimentswas trained for nine combinations of KSIC and HS Code standardization levels. For each combination, experiments were repeated ten times with the test ratio fixed at 20%. The results are summarized in Table 8. Table 8.

In contrast, the Level-3 combination consistently achieved the best performance, with MAE values of 33.253, 23.710, and 1.892 across all EDI states. Compared to the Level-1 combination, the Level3 combination achieved performance improvements of 8.50%, 7.74%, and 4.20%. Examining the individual effects of each standardized variable reveals distinct performance trends. KSIC exhibited average MAE values of 35.148, 34.673, and 34.129 for Levels 13, respectively, corresponding to 2.90% improvement at Level-3 relative to Level-1. HS Code standardization yielded MAE values of 35.812, 34.392, and 33.746 across Levels13, resulting in larger improvement of 5.77% at Level-3 compared to Level-1. These results indicate that increasingly fine-grained standardization of both KSIC and HS Codes provides more informative features for ICDT prediction and that each standardized result independently contributes to performance improvement. Figure 4. SHAP Values by EDI State Finally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was employed to analyze the key variables influencing ICDT prediction. SHAP is an interpretability method based on Shapley values from game theory, which quantitatively measures the contribution of each input variable to models predictions. It is widely used to interpret complex ML models. This analysis aims to verify whether the Gen AIbased standardization results namely HS and KSIC Codesmeaningfully contribute to ICDT prediction. The analysis was conducted using the CAT model trained with Level-3 standardized OI and CI. Since independent prediction models are trained for each EDI state, variable importance was computed separately for each state. The results are presented in Fig. 4. In the IN-state, HS and KSIC Codes were identified as the most influential variables, followed by weekday, cargo type, and country. In contrast, holiday, Bill of Lading (BL) type, carrier, and cargo size exhibited relatively 16 lower importance. In the CR-state, HS Code remained the most influential variable, while the importance of KSIC Code slightly decreased. In addition, the 𝐸𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑑𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 and 𝐷𝑢𝑒𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 variablesintroduced at this state exhibited substantial contributions to ICDT prediction, indicating that incorporating EDI-based temporal information significantly enhances predictive capability. In the CP-state, HS and KSIC Codes again emerged as the most influential variables, while the importance of 𝐷𝑢𝑒𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒, which represents the delivery deadline of an import container, increased markedly. This pattern can be attributed to operational policies requiring the assigned departure truck to complete delivery before the due date. Overall, the Gen AI-based standardization results were consistently identified as the most influential variables across most EDI states. Furthermore, variables generated according to EDI state progression were also found to play important roles in ICDT prediction. These findings provide strong evidence that standardizing unstructured data is essential for improving ICDT prediction performance. 6. Simulation This section analyzes whether the two core components of the proposed frameworkGen AI-based standardization and EDI-based re-predictioncan reduce the number of relocations in container terminals. Relocation reduction is widely recognized as critical performance indicator, as it enhances productivity by preventing operational delays through reduced service time and by lowering energy consumption through more efficient equipment utilization (Chhetri et al. 2024; De Armas Jacomino et al. 2021; Maldonado et al. 2019). To this end, simulation environment was constructed based on the study by Maldonado et al. (2019), in which the predicted ICDT (p-ICDT) generated by the proposed framework is utilized to determine the stacking positions of containers. This approach is referred to as the p-ICDT strategy and is compared with the conventional operational strategy to evaluate whether it reduces the number of relocations. In addition, since the number of relocations may vary depending on yard occupancydefined as the ratio of currently stacked containers to total yard capacitymultiple occupancy scenarios were constructed by adjusting the available stacking capacity. These scenarios enable systematic evaluation of the proposed framework under different yard occupancy conditions."

            "title": "6.1 Simulation Setup and Assumptions",
            "content": "To construct simulation environment that closely reflects real-world operations, the following assumptions are adopted. Conditions (6)(8) follow the operational practices of the container terminal used in the empirical experiments. (1) The collected experimental data are sorted by unloading time. 80% of the historical data is used to develop the ICDT prediction models, while the remaining 20% is used for simulation to prevent information leakage. The simulation includes 78,877 import containers that are stacked in the storage yard and subsequently depart from the terminal. The p-ICDT is used to determine their stacking positions, and the simulation terminates once all containers have departed. (2) During the simulation, ICDT is predicted using the CAT model, which exhibited the best performance in the previous experiments, and these predicted values are used. (3) Each container is associated with its actual recorded unloading time, EDI state update times, and departure time. (4) All yards are assumed to have identical dimensions, with 12 rows, 20 bays, and 7 tiers. (5) All yards are assumed to be empty at the beginning of the simulation. (6) Import containers and reefer containers are stacked in separate yards. (7) Containers of two sizes, 20 ft and 40 ft, are considered. Although both are stored within the same yard, dedicated areas are allocated for each size. (8) Containers being unloaded must be stacked completely within the current tier before containers can be placed in the next tier. (9) Containers are randomly assigned to stacking positions in the first tier, while the p-ICDT strategy is applied from the second tier onward. This is because the p-ICDT strategy requires the presence of containers already stacked in lower tiers to determine appropriate stacking positions. (10) After unloading, the EDI state of an import container is updated sequentially to IN, CR, CP, and OUT. ICDT is initially predicted at the IN state, then re-predicted at the CR and CP states, and treated as the container's current ICDT at each stage. (11) The predicted p-ICDT decreases as time elapses, and when it becomes negative, it is fixed at zero. 17 (12) The number of relocations is defined as the total number of containers stacked above target container at the time of its departure, with each such container counted as one relocation. All containers stacked above the target container are re-stacked within the same yard according to the same stacking strategy. Table 9.

First, when an import container is unloaded, its ICDT is predicted. This predicted value is regarded as the containers p-ICDT until its EDI state is updated. Next, for all operating yard locations (yard, row, bay), the stored p-ICDT of the topmost container is retrieved. The location of the container with the largest p-ICDT (i.e., the container predicted to remain in the yard the longest) is selected, and the new container is stacked on top of it. This strategy minimizes relocations by promoting stacking order in which containers with imminent departures remain closer to the top. Relocations are counted at the time of an import containers departure from the yard. The overall decision-making process applied to the experimental data is presented in Algorithm 2. 18 Algorithm 2.

Setting (a) follows the same simulation setup as described in Section 6.1, but omits the p-ICDT-based stacking decision process. This setting most closely reflects the current operational environment, in which containers are stacked starting from the lowest available tier in the yard. When multiple feasible positions exist at the same tier, one position is randomly selected for stacking. Setting (b) determines the stacking position using p-ICDT values obtained from the proposed framework (Algorithm 2). Setting (c) follows the same decision rule as (b) but replaces p-ICDT with a-ICDT, thereby providing theoretical upper bound on relocation reduction. When the stacking capacity of the yard is exceeded, containers that cannot be stacked are assumed to be stored in temporary yard and are excluded from relocation tracking. Table 10 reports the average results obtained over 10 repeated simulations. Table 10.

However, the magnitude of this effect differed substantially depending on the yard occupancy. In the Yard 24 scenarios, maximum yard occupancy reached 100% at certain time points, whereas the average yard occupancy ranged from 48.3% to 74.7%. This was because yard capacity was temporarily exceeded due to the unloading of large volumes of import containers from ultra-large vessels. Under such high-occupancy conditions, the p-ICDT strategy achieved an average relocation reduction of only 4.29%. As yard occupancy decreased, the relocation reduction effect increased gradually. Specifically, as occupancy decreased from the Yard 5 to Yard 9 scenarios, the relocation reduction rate continuously increased from 7.65% to 14.68%. However, when the average occupancy decreased from 20% to 10%, the improvement plateaued, with the rate changing only from 14.68% to 14.67%. This suggests that below certain occupancy level, further reductions in relocations are no longer achievable. The target container terminal considered in this study maintains an average yard occupancy of 40%, under which the p-ICDT strategy is expected to yield relocation reduction of 7.65%. In addition, by comparing the results of a-ICDT and p-ICDT, we analyzed the theoretical upper bound of relocation reduction achievable in the absence of ICDT prediction errors. In the Yard 2 scenario, p-ICDT achieved relocation reduction of 2.89%, whereas a-ICDT achieved 4.80%, resulting in difference of only 1.91% between the two methods. Given that a-ICDT is practically unobservable, this result indicates that under high-occupancy conditions, there is limited room for further reduction in relocations even with improved prediction performance. In contrast, the largest gap between p-ICDT and the theoretical upper bound was observed in the Yard 8 scenario, where a-ICDT achieved 22.08% greater reduction than p-ICDT. This suggests that under relatively lowoccupancy conditions, improvements in prediction performance can substantially increase the relocation reduction effect. These relocation reductions can be further illustrated through the visualization of stacking inversions. stacking inversion occurs when lower container has an earlier pickup time than the container stacked above it, necessitating the relocation of the upper container to pick up the lower container. These inversions were identified during simulation by applying the p-ICDT strategy and using a-ICDT as the reference. Fig. 5 visualizes specific time point during simulation under identical conditions for both strategies, with inversions highlighted in red. (a) Baseline (b) p-ICDT strategy Figure 5. Visual Comparison of ICDT-based Stacking Strategy and Baseline Panel (a) and panel (b) correspond to the experimental settings (a) and (b) defined in Section 6.3, respectively. In this snapshot, panel (b) shows more than 50% reduction in stacking inversions compared to panel (a). This example illustrates how the p-ICDT strategy reduces the occurrence of stacking inversions compared to the baseline approach, suggesting its potential to reduce the set of containers requiring relocation. 6.4 Effectiveness of Gen AIBased Standardization Since this study leverages Gen AI-based standardization results for ICDT prediction, it is important to analyze its impact on productivity improvement. To this end, we applied the p-ICDT strategy using CAT models trained with and without the standardization results and compared the resulting differences in relocation reduction. The results are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Impact of Gen AIBased Standardization on Relocation Reduction"

Across all senarios, case (b) consistently achieved fewer relocations than case (a), with an average reduction rate of 3.19%. The magnitude of the effect varied with yard occupancy. Under the conditions where the maximum occupancy reached 100% (Yards 24), the average reduction was limited to 1.11%, whereas value of 4.23% was observed under the remaining conditions. Notably, in Yard 5, whose occupancy level most closely reflects the actual operating conditions of the target container terminal, relocations were reduced by 2.02%. 21 Figure 6. Relocation Reduction Performance in Week With Normal Yard Occupancy Figure 7. Relocation Reduction Performance in Week With the Highest Yard Occupancy To observe the daily relocation reduction achieved by applying the proposed framework within the p-ICDT strategy, we conducted simulations for the Yard 5 setting, which exhibits yard occupancy level similar to the actual operational environment. The simulation setting is identical to that described in Section 6.1. Two operational situations were observed in detail during the simulation: (1) week with average yard occupancy and low variability  (Fig. 6)  and (2) week in which yard occupancy reached its maximum during the simulation  (Fig. 7)  . For each situation, we built separate CAT models for the cases with and without Gen AI standardization results, applied them to the p-ICDT strategy, and compared their relocation performance. Yard occupancy was measured at the end of each day during the simulation and computed as the ratio of stacked containers to the total yard capacity. Fig. 6 presents the results under normal operational conditions, where yard occupancy remains close to its average level. In case (b), which does not use the standardization results, an average relocation reduction of 12.46% was observed relative to the baseline. In contrast, case (c), which uses the standardization results, achieved an average relocation reduction of 19.25%. This demonstrates that, under normal operating conditions, incorporating the Gen AI standardization results as input variables can further reduce relocations even when the same prediction model is used. These findings indicate that adopting Gen AI can make tangible contribution to improving the operational efficiency of container terminals. Fig. 7 presents the results for the week with the highest yard occupancy during the simulation period. At times 𝑡 and 𝑡 + 1, when yard occupancy was relatively low, case (b) achieved relocation reductions of 4.10% and 15.88% relative to the baseline, respectively, whereas case (c) achieved larger reductions of 17.07% and 29.60%, showing substantially greater effect with the incorporation of standardization results. However, at time 𝑡 + 4, when yard occupancy exceeded 80%, both cases showed the same reduction of 7.33%, indicating that the benefit of using the standardization results became negligible at high occupancies. As yard occupancy decreased at times 𝑡 + 5 and 𝑡 + 6 , the pattern re-emerged, with the use of standardization results again leading to additional 22 relocation reductions. These results suggest that Gen AIbased standardization is effective for reducing relocations under typical operational conditions, whereas its effect is limited when yard occupancy is very high. Across both situations, the use of standardization results consistently reduced relocations than models without standardization. These findings lead to two important implications. First, ICDT predictions generated by the proposed framework can contribute to relocation reduction across diverse operational conditions. Second, to maximize the effect of Gen AI standardization, maintaining yard occupancy at an appropriate level is essential, highlighting key consideration for applying the p-ICDT strategy. 6.5 Effectiveness of EDI-Based Re-Prediction This study re-predicts ICDT whenever the EDI state is updated, based on the assumption that successive updates progressively narrow the plausible range of ICDT and thereby reduce prediction uncertainty. However, if this approach does not contribute to relocation reduction, predicting ICDT only once at the unloading time of an import container may be sufficient. Therefore, we conducted comparative experiment in which two strategies were examined: (1) predicting ICDT only once at the initial gate-in time and (2) performing EDI-based re-prediction at each state. The results of this comparison are presented in Table 12. Table 12.

In particular, under the Yard 5 setting, which is similar to the current operational environment, this approach yielded an additional reduction of 1.32%. This improvement can be attributed to improved prediction accuracy associated with EDI state transitions. As shown in Table 7 in Section 5.2, MAE decreased from 33.253 to 23.710 when transitioning from the IN-state to the CR-state, indicating that the availability of customs clearance completion information reduces uncertainty in ICDT prediction. Because the re-predicted ICDT reflects the imminence of container retrieval more accurately, the p-ICDT strategy can make more precise decisions. Moreover, if additional EDI states are identified through collaboration with domain experts in future work, further improvements in ICDT prediction performance and relocation reduction are expected. 23 Figure 8. Relocation Reduction Across Different Combinations of Core Components Finally, we comprehensively compared the relocation reduction effects associated with the two core components of the proposed framework. Fig. 8 shows the relocation reduction ratios under different component configurations, with the number of relocations in the operational baseline (a) normalized to 100%. In configuration (b), ICDT is predicted without the use of standardization results and without EDI-based re-prediction. Configuration (c) applies only EDI-based re-prediction, configuration (d) utilizes only the standardization results, and configuration (e) represents the full proposed framework, incorporating both components. The results show consistent pattern of progressively decreasing relocations in the order of (b)(c)(d)(e). Compared with the baseline, (b) achieved an average relocation reduction of 4.82% across all yard settings. Applying only EDI-based re-prediction in (c) achieved 6.31%, while using only the standardization results in (d) achieved 8.57%. When both components were applied in (e), an average relocation reduction of 9.25% was achieved compared with the baseline. Under the Yard 5 setting, which is the most similar to the operational environment, relocation reductions relative to the baseline increased monotonically from 4.22% in (b), to 5.74% in (c), 6.33% in (d), and 7.65% in (e). These results quantitatively demonstrate the effects of the two core components and confirm that the proposed framework can make concrete and measurable contribution to productivity improvement in container terminals. 7.

            "title": "7.1 Applicability of the Collaborative Framework",
            "content": "The proposed framework is designed with practical applicability to container terminals and offers four advantages. 1) It can be easily integrated with existing terminal operation system databases. Container terminals typically receive advance information on containers scheduled for unloading, enabling standardization to be performed in advance using Gen AI. This design resolves potential bottlenecks that may arise when deploying Gen AI in real-time operational settings and, when combined with the fast inference time of the ML model, allows the framework to operate without undue burden in practice. Moreover, because the framework follows an end-toend structure that operates without raw data processing or additional preprocessing, dedicated maintenance personnel are not required. This feature enables conservative practitioners in container terminals to adopt stateof-the-art technology without changing the existing operational environment. 2) The framework ensures interpretability of both the standardization and prediction results. Since both the standardization process (see Tables 46) and the ML model are explicitly interpretable, the framework provides transparent explanations of variable contributions. This high level of interpretability enables port operators to establish various policies based on the interpreted results. 3) The framework supports multilingual operation. Port logistics is an international industry, and OI/CI are recorded and managed in diverse languages. Gen AI enables these heterogeneous textual inputs to be consistently mapped to unified standard codes, eliminating linguistic barriers. 4) The caching mechanism of the STD Bank continuously reduces operational costs as standardization results accumulate over time (see Fig. 9). 24 Figure 9. Progressive Reduction of Gen AI Request Ratio and Cost Fig. 9 illustrates the Gen AI usage ratio and the associated cost per 1,000 containers, where the cost is based on Gemini 2.5 Flash, which was adopted in this study. In the first month after introducing the proposed framework, Gen AI was used for 26% of OI and 40% of CI among all unloaded import containers, resulting in an approximate cost of 3.8 USD per 1,000 containers. After one year, the Gen AI usage ratio decreased to 4.82% for OI and 29.92% for CI, reducing the cost to 1.92 USD per 1,000 containers. For CI, the reuse rate of the standardization results decreased more gradually than that for OI. This is attributable to the higher variability in CI expressions compared with OI. This trend is particularly important from an economic perspective. While relocation-related operational costs accumulate approximately linearly over time as yard operations continue, the cost associated with Gen AI usage decreases due to the caching mechanism of the STD Bank. Consequently, break-even point can emerge at which the cumulative savings achieved through relocation reduction offset the cost incurred by adopting Gen AI. In summary, the proposed framework offers high practicality due to its deployability, interpretability, multilingual capability, and cost-effectiveness. These characteristics indicate that the framework can serve as useful reference for integrating Gen AI into real-world port logistics operations."

            "content": "This study employed an EDI-tracking and re-prediction strategy to reduce uncertainty in ICDT prediction. However, because EDI systems can differ across countries and ports, applying the proposed framework in practice requires identifying EDI events that are suitable for the target terminal in collaboration with domain experts. For example, when Terminal Appointment System (TAS) is available, the framework can initially predict ICDT at the unloading stage (i.e., IN-state), then refine the prediction once the pickup truck's expected arrival time is confirmed through TAS. Incorporating such port-specific characteristics plays key factor in the successful application of the proposed framework in practice. In addition, because ICDT inherently involves high uncertainty, securing reliable training data is essential. This requires establishing systematic operational standards and close collaboration among stakeholders. High-quality data can be obtained under sustainable operational regulations, under which variables maintain meaningful relationships with ICDT. In contrast, in environments where such policies are absent or poorly designed, it may be difficult to collect data with predictable patterns. In some ports, ICDT has been reported to extend up to 90 days due to excessively low storage fees. Under such conditions, ICDT is determined by stakeholders arbitrary decisions rather than by relationships among variables, thereby constraining the development of reliable prediction models. Therefore, to ensure the effectiveness of ICDT prediction, an operational system that guarantees the predictability of ICDT should be established before adopting prediction technologies."

            "title": "7.3 Security and Privacy Considerations",
            "content": "Container terminals serve as intermediaries in supply chains and handle large volumes of sensitive information. Because CI contains detailed information on imported items and OI identifies the entity associated with those items, processing such data with Gen AI may raise security concerns among terminal operators and their customers. To address this issue, two approaches can be considered. First, Gen AI infrastructure can be established at the port 25 authority level. Compared with individual terminal operators directly using commercial Gen AI services, infrastructure built and managed by public institution provides greater neutrality and trust. Second, Gen AI can be deployed on-premise within individual container terminals. In this case, data remain within the terminal and are processed internally, thereby eliminating the risk of external information leakage. These approaches can enable individual terminal operators to utilize advanced technologies while addressing security concerns, potentially facilitating broader adoption of Gen AI technologies across the port logistics industry. 7.4 Limitations limitation of this study is that Gen AI does not guarantee consistent outputs for the same input. This is confirmed by the consistency test results. Table 13 reports an experiment in which the top 100 most frequent entries from CI and OI were extracted, and the same inputs were repeatedly provided to examine whether consistent standardization results are obtained. The consistency rate was computed using Eq. (21). 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 = (1 𝑁𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑒 1 𝑁𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 1 ) 100 (21) Table 13. Consistency Rate of CI and OI Standardization Information CI OI Level-1 98.44% 96.15% Standardization Level Level-2 96.63% 91.25% Level-3 90.31% 84.05% At Level-1, consistency rate of 98.44% was observed, meaning that approximately 98 out of the 100 CI entries returned identical standardization results across 10 repeated requests. At Level-2 and Level-3, the consistency rates were 96.63% and 90.31%, respectively. For OI, high consistency rate of 96.15% was observed at Level-1, whereas the rates decreased to 91.25% and 84.05% at Level-2 and Level-3, respectively. Table 14. Examples of Gen AI Reasoning for Invalid Classification Figure 10. Distribution of CI Text Length CI TUBE STERILE Reason* The cargo description TUBE is very broad term that lacks specific attributes such as material, usage, or diameter. Based on this information alone, it is not possible to identify the corresponding HS Code at the 2-, 4-, or 6-digit level. Therefore, additional information is required for accurate HS Code classification. The cargo description STERILE only indicates the condition or characteristic of the item and does not provide specific product names or material information. Therefore, it is not possible to classify it under any HS Code. Additional cargo details that reveal the essential nature of the product are required for accurate HS Code classification. GARMENTS The cargo description GARMENTS alone lacks the detailed information necessary for HS Code classification at the 6-digit level, such as material composition, product type (e.g., shirts, trousers), and whether the item is knitted or woven. Therefore, precise HS Code classification based on the essential characteristics of the goods is not possible. 26 *: Generated from Gen AI Such reductions in consistency rate tend to occur when the provided information is insufficient. Fig. 10 illustrates this pattern: when Gen AI judged standardization to be feasible during the validation check, the input text had an average length of 85 characters, whereas when it was judged as invalid, the average length was approximately 20 charactersmore than four times shorter than those in the valid cases. This finding indicates that shorter input texts often fail to provide sufficient information for Gen AI to determine the HS code, leading to limitations in standardization. This observation is further supported by the Gen AI reasoning results in Table 14. For example, for extremely short CI entries such as TUBE, STERILE, and GARMENTS, Gen AI provided reasons such as lacks specific attributes, indicating that inputs were too ambiguous to identify the essential characteristics of the product. Therefore, improving standardization consistency under limitedinformation conditions remains key limitation of this study and represents an important direction for future research. 8. Conclusion and Future Research The proposed framework improves ICDT prediction performance by combining Gen AI-based standardization and EDI-based re-prediction. In particular, introducing Gen AI-based standardization achieved up to 13.88% improvement in ICDT prediction, and the highest performance was obtained when more fine-grained standardization results were used. In addition, when the predicted ICDT values were incorporated into stacking strategy for container placement, the proposed approach achieved an average relocation reduction of 9.26% and maximum reduction of 14.68% relative to the operational baseline. Notably, even when all other variables and the same prediction model were used, incorporating the Gen AI-based standardization results led to an additional average relocation reduction of 3.19% compared with models that did not use them. These results have important implications in that they identify concrete points at which Gen AI can be applied in container terminal operations and empirically demonstrate that Gen AI can contribute to productivity improvement. This study has important implications not only for productivity improvement but also for environmentally sustainable operations. Modern port operations are increasingly required to simultaneously achieve productivity and environmental performance; however, these objectives are often in trade-off relationship. Container terminals tend to maximize equipment utilization to prevent delays in vessel operations, which can improve productivity but may conflict with environmental sustainability. practical way to mitigate this dilemma is to improve equipment-use efficiency for the same workload. By reducing unnecessary relocations through ICDTbased stacking strategies, the proposed framework can reduce unnecessary yard crane operations for given container throughput. This suggests viable pathway for simultaneously improving productivity and environmental performance, thereby contributing to sustainable port operations. Future work can extend this study by addressing the limitations discussed in Section 7.4. First, further studies are needed to improve the consistency of standardization. Specifically, this may involve advancing promptengineering techniques and introducing multi-agent approaches to validate standardization results. In addition, Retrieval-Augmented Generation can be adopted to enable standardization with direct access to the target classification systems. Second, developing resource-efficient Small Language Models with performance comparable to commercial Gen AI represents an important research direction for container terminal applications. Such models would enhance practical deployability while also addressing security concerns. Finally, because this study was conducted at single container terminal at Busan Port, future work should validate the generalizability of the proposed framework across diverse port environments. Through these follow-up studies, Gen AI-based approaches are expected to become practical solutions that improve both productivity and sustainability across the port logistics domain. 27 Appendix 1.
