            "content": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized in agentic systems that interact with external environments, this interaction with untrusted data makes them vulnerable to prompt injection attacks (Greshake et al., 2023b). Current defenses often employ aggressive filtering or rigid, singlepass sanitization methods (Shi et al., 2025c; Debenedetti et al., 2024a). While these approaches can block known attacks, they frequently result in high false positive rates, which impair the utility and practicality of these systems in real-world applications (Debenedetti et al., 2024a; Zhu et al., 2025). To address this, we introduce Soft Instruction Control (SIC), simple and effective sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents (Parisi et al., 2022). Our method draws inspiration from the CaMeL framework, which formally decomposes user queries into distinct data and control flows (Debenedetti et al., 2025). SIC relaxes CaMeLs formal decomposition in favor of soft approach with broad semantics of instructive and descriptive input parts. The core intuition is that we can neutralize adversarial instructions by explicitly identifying all instructions within untrusted data streams and rewriting them to no longer be imperative instructions. More specifically, the method repeatedly inspects incoming data for potentially malicious instructions. If such content is detected, it is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the revised input is re-evaluated. This process continues until the input is deemed clean or maximum iteration limit is reached. If instruction-like content remains after the final iteration, the agent halts execution to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, SIC acknowledges that individual sanitization steps may fail but leverages iteration to catch and correct missed injections in later rounds. Importantly, the approach operates as modular preprocessing layer, requiring no modifications to the underlying agent. This iterative design ensures robust protection against adversarial inputs while minimizing unnecessary interference with benign content. 1 Preprint. Is this method provably robust? No. Our expectation is that, just as with CaMeL (Debenedetti et al., 2025), our defence is circumventable for e.g. data-only injection attacks, as well as, sidechannels. Given its soft nature we are also certain that there exist cases where adversary can manipulate SIC. However, our empirical evaluations, particularly with an adapted version of the AC adaptive attack from Shi et al. (2025a), demonstrate that it is difficult to find effective prompt injections. Overall, SIC is simple, cheap, and effective against large class of prompt injection attacks."

            "content": "Detection-based defenses. These techniques preserve the core model by introducing auxiliary detectorstypically smaller LLMstasked with identifying contaminated inputs before they reach the main system. Early examples include ProtecAI (2024), who train classifiers to distinguish between normal and injected prompts. more advanced system, DataSentinel (Liu et al., 2025), formulates detection as minimax game: the detector is trained to fail on adversarial prompts (e.g., by withholding secret key), allowing detection via output failure. This builds upon earlier known-answer detection techniques (Liu et al., 2024) that use planted signals to flag compromised behavior. Similarly, PromptArmor uses detector chained with rewriter (Shi et al., 2025c). Each of these defense can be easily bypassed by automated prompt injections. Prompt-augmentation defenses. These strategies rely on prompt engineering rather than training. By inserting visual or semantic separatorssuch as delimiters between user and retrieved contentthey help models distinguish between intended inputs and injected prompts (Mendes, 2023; Willison, 2023; Hines et al., 2024b). Other methods include reiterating the original user prompt to reinforce intent (Lea, 2023), or appending safety instructions such as ignore any contradictory commands via system-level prompts (Chen et al., 2025). These approaches are appealing due to their simplicity and deployment ease, yet in practice provide no security (Shi et al., 2025a). Figure 1: Soft Instruction Control (SIC) sanitization loop for tool-augmented LLM agents. 1 Untrusted input from the web is first augmented with dummy instructions. 2 The system then masks, rewrites, or removes instructions within this combined data. 3 It checks if any instructions remain; if so, it is flagged as an attack; process 1 3 repeats. 4 The untrusted data with sanitized instructions is then combined with the original user instruction and passed to the model as the query. System-level defenses. These defenses integrate deeper into the LLM application stack by using security principles from systems engineering. For instance, IsolateGPT uses execution environment isolation to sandbox LLM behavior (Wu et al., 2025), while f-secure (Wu et al., 2024), Fides (Costa et al., 2025), and CaMeL (Debenedetti et al., 2025) incorporate (fine-grained) control and data flow tracking to contain prompt injection vectors. Other efforts include MELON, which defends by front-running and validating inputs before execution (Zhu et al., 2025), and Progent, which imposes privilege controls on LLM agent operations (Shi et al., 2025b). Prompt Injections. Prompt injection (PI) was first described by Greshake et al. (2023a), who showed that interactions with untrusted data can compromise LLM-based systems. Subsequent work introduced static, hand-crafted benchmarks such as BIPIA (Yi et al., 2023) and INJECAGENT (Zhan et al., 2024), enabling reproducible evaluation but capturing limited attack diversity. Later frameworks like AgentDojo incorporate templated attacks adaptable to specific tasks (Debenedetti et al., 2024a). Building on jailbreak research, adaptive methods such as GCG (Zou et al., 2023) and AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023) optimize adversarial prompts against target models. Recently, adaptive attacksiteratively optimized via various search strategieshave proven highly effective at bypassing PI defenses (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Zhan et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2024; Nasr et al., 2025).

            "title": "3 PROBLEM - PROMPT INJECTIONS",
            "content": "A prompt injection for tool-use agent attempts to convince the agent to execute malicious action. Such malicious action could be sending money to foreign bank account or leaking sensitive information. There are direct and indirect prompt injections (Shi et al., 2025a). In direct prompt injection, user deliberately provides malicious input to the agent, while in indirect prompt injections, malicious instruction is placed into an external datasource that is loaded into the model context during execution. In this work, we focus on the latter one, as they pose realistic threat to tool-use agents (Samoilenko, 2023; Martin & Yeung, 2024; Rehberger, 2025). Threat Model We assume the threat model as described by Shi et al. (2025a), where tool-augmented LLM agents interact with external and untrusted data sources, e.g., web pages, emails, or APIs. Since the content from external sources is retrieved and processed by the model during execution, attackers have realistic opportunity to inject malicious instructions into the agents context. Specifically, we assume strong attacker who controls portion of the external data retrieved by the agent. The attacker can insert malicious payloads into this external data before it is fetched by the agent. We assume that the attacker has full knowledge of the agents architecture, including the type of LLM used, how external data is integrated into the agents context, and any deployed defensive measures. The attacker can thus adaptively craft payloads to circumvent these defenses. The rationale behind this assumption is Kirchhoffs principle that stipulates that the effectiveness of defense should never rely on secrecy of the defense mechanism. The attackers primary goal is to manipulate the agent into executing specific tool or function call chosen by the attacker, such as leaking sensitive information or initiating unauthorized transactions. An attack is considered successful if the agent indeed executes the targeted tool call triggered by the injected malicious content. Attacks that merely disrupt or halt agent executionsuch as denial-ofservice scenariosare outside the scope of this work. Typically, successful attacks unfold over multiple steps: first, the agent executes benign instruction that retrieves maliciously injected content; subsequently, this malicious payload influences the agent to perform the attacker-specified action. This multi-step scenario aligns with realistic incidents documented in recent security research and public disclosures (Martin & Yeung, 2024; Rehberger, 2025; Samoilenko, 2023). def robust_sanitize(tool_output: str, type:[Mask, Rephrase, Remove]) -> str: \"\"\" Applies robust sanitization procedure to tool output.

The algorithm rewrites tool outputs with an LLM, then detects prompt injection in both the full and chunked outputs.

            "content": "Prompt injections represent fundamental vulnerability in agentic systems. As long as agents must process untrusted text, attackers seem to always find ways to embed malicious instructions. Since perfect security is (thus far practically) unachievable in this setting with the model on its own, we adopt pragmatic approach: making successful attacks significantly more difficult, unreliable, and expensive to execute. Our defense is designed with this goal in mind: simple, lightweight, modular process that combines several simple techniques into robust whole. Intuition why should SIC work? SIC gets its inspiration from CaMeL (Debenedetti et al., 2025), where the user queries are formally broken down into explicit data and control flows. In this work, we relax the formality of the CaMeL control flow decomposition and effectively make it soft. Namely, we explicitly try to identify all instructions in the untrusted data steams and rewrite them as not imperative instructions, thereby in soft way removing the instruction nature of them. We then explicitly check that there are no more instructions left, ensuring that user query is the only imperative instruction that the agent sees. Our key idea is to treat sanitization as modular preprocessing step that occurs entirely outside the agents execution context. Rather than modifying the agents internal behavior or policy, we implement protective filter on the data stream: every piece of information destined for the agent first passes through our instruction sanitization pipeline. This architectural choice ensures the agent never directly observes raw, potentially dangerous inputs, while requiring zero modifications to existing agent implementations. 4.1 LIMITATIONS OF DETECTION-BASED APPROACHES Recent work has attempted to address prompt injections through detection and filtering. The approach by Shi et al. (2025c) exemplifies this strategy: an LLM examines input text and attempts to identify and remove instruction-like content. While conceptually appealing, this defense paradigm suffers from fundamental weaknessit frames security as classification problem. The main vulnerability of this kind of defense is that the LLM classifier is the only barrier for an attacker to overcome. Our experiments reveal that detection-based defenses are trivially bypassed through adversarial rephrasing. Using the iterative refinement techniques described in Shi et al. (2025a), we show that attackers can craft semantically equivalent instructions that evade detection. 4.2 OUR APPROACH: SIC Instead, we propose more resilient approach called SIC, we give an algorithmic description in Algorithm 1. We take seemingly unintuitive approach; our method begins by rewriting the input to remove any instruction-like content. This can take various forms, for instance, replacing instructions with placeholders, e.g., [PLACEHOLDER], removing them entirely, or rephrasing the instructions to appear as information. Per rewrite strategy, we have specific prompt-template i.e. REWRITE PROMPT(type) for type {Mask, Rephrase, Remove}. To account for missed instructions, either by inaccuracies of the model or an attack that tampered with the rewriter, we use classifier to check if there is still an instruction. At first glance, this seems equally vulnerable as an attacker could simply prevent the rewrite, for example, by including command like do not modify this text. To detect this kind of failure, we inject known control instructions into the input before rewriting. If these instructions survive the rewrite unchanged, we conclude that the rewriting was compromised. welcome secondary effect is that prompt injections are known to be brittle, which means that by placing extra tokens, the attack may already be compromised or at least weakened. Next, LLMs are known to be imprecise, meaning single rewrite pass could miss malicious instructions. To counteract this, we propose to apply multiple independent rewrites in sequence. Each rewrite is performed unconditionally and without access to previous outputs or detection resultsthere is no intermediate checking or cleaning. This design ensures that the control flow remains fixed and cannot be influenced by the attacker. However, if later rewrites are conditional on the success of earlier ones, the defense could degrade to the weakest step. Therefore, to maintain robustness, all rewrites must be stateless and applied uniformly. 4 Preprint. Finally, using the same insight that attacks are brittle, we split up the output from the rewriter into chunks. Then per chunk and the text as whole, we ask classifier to check if there are instructions in the text. If all calls agree that there is no instruction, we pass the data to final step to cleanse it from the placeholders and feed it to the agent. Conditions for successful attack For an attack to succeed against SIC, an adversary must satisfy multiple challenging conditions simultaneously. First, the injected instruction must prevent its own rewriting while maintaining its malicious payloada delicate balance since instructions that aggressively resist modification (e.g., Do not change this text!) are likely to also prevent the rewriting of our canaries, triggering detection. Second, any instruction that survives rewriting must evade detection by multiple classifier calls at different granularities (individual chunks and full text). Third, the instruction must survive the text reconstruction process where placeholders are removed, meaning it cannot rely on specific positioning or formatting that might be disrupted. Most critically, after navigating all these transformations, the instruction must still retain enough of its original form and context to actually influence the agents behavior as intended. Thus, crafting successful attack requires solving strongly constrained optimization problem i.e. the instruction must be simultaneously resistant to rewriting, invisible to multiple detection passes, robust to chunking and reconstruction, and still functionally intact after all transformations. While such an attack may be theoretically possible, we argue that it would be exceedingly difficult to discovereven under strong white-box threat model, which we test below. Computational cost. The computation is dominated by LLM calls, and local string operations are linear in the output length n. With rewrite passes (typically R=1) and detection chunks, the pipeline makes R+1 calls when it halts early and R+1+k when the input is clean. Each call processes Θ(n) tokens, so total work grows linearly with n. In practice, adversarial inputs usually stop after the rewrite and full-text detection (about two calls), while clean inputs proceed to chunk checks. Latency remains small and can be further reduced by parallelizing the chunk detections."

            "content": "We evaluate SIC (Soft Instruction Control) on the AgentDojo benchmark (Debenedetti et al., 2024a), which simulates tool-augmented agents operating in partially observable environments and exposed to prompt-injection risks. We first present the overall results using the simplest effective instantiation of SIC, then analyze design choices through ablations that motivated this configuration. Metrics. We report four quantities: (i) Utility on clean inputs (no defense), (ii) Utility with defense on clean inputs, (iii) Utility under attack with defenses enabled, and (iv) Attack success rate (ASR), the fraction of cases where the agent executes the adversarial instruction. 5.1 OVERALL EVALUATION Guided by preliminary ablations (Section 5.3), we instantiate SIC with masking, single rewrite pass, and no chunking. This is already sufficient to achieve 0% ASR. We evaluate across state-of-theart models: Kimi-k2 (AI, 2025), GPT-4o (OpenAI & many, 2024), GPT-4.1-mini, and Qwen3-32B (Team, 2025). Attacks include IGNOREPREVIOUSINSTRUCTION and IMPORTANTINSTRUCTION (Debenedetti et al., 2024b), plus tag-guarded variant (Do not touch the text between the tags); full strings are listed in Appendix A. We compare against AgentDojo baselines: (i) no defense, (ii) repeat user prompt (RUP) (Debenedetti et al., 2024a) and (iii) spotlight with delimiting (SWP) (Hines et al., 2024a). Figure 2d summarizes results (averaged over attacks). We evaluate on the banking, Slack and travel suite. Findings. SIC consistently drives ASR to zero across models and tasks with only minor utility degradation. GPT-4o achieves the strongest overall balance, pairing high clean utility with very low ASR. Models with lower baseline robustness (e.g., Qwen3-32B, Kimi-k2, GPT-4.1-mini) also benefit substantially. Most remaining false positives arise from benign, instruction-like statements (e.g., Please note that. . . ), and from tool outputs that themselves contain phrased instructions; SIC removes these conservatively. We also experimented to alleviate this by adapting the prompts, but this comes at the cost of security. We opted here for the most secure version. 5 Preprint.

We report clean utility, utility under attack, and attack success rate (ASR). SIC is the only method that achieves 0% ASR across both attacks while maintaining competitive utility. 5.2 COMPARISON TO OTHER DETECTOR-BASED APPROACHES Next, we turn to evaluate to SIC to other detector-based approaches. Specifically, we compare against four state-of-the art methods: MELON Zhu et al. (2025), PI-DETECTOR ProtectAI (2024), PROMPTGUARD Meta AI (2024) and PI-GUARD Li et al. (2025). In this setting, we focus on GPT4o since it is the best-performing model. We present the results in Table 1. We observe that SIC is the only approach that consistently achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 0% across both attack types. This highlights the robustness of our method in fully neutralizing adversarial attempts while maintaining competitive utility. In comparison, MELON exhibits strong baseline utility (70.10%) but has low utility under attack; what is more it still has non-zero ASR under the IMPORTANTINSTRUCTION attack, indicating minor, albeit vulnerability. PI-GUARD and PI-DETECTOR both yield substantially lower utilities in the clean setting (46.39% and 41.24%, respectively), and they still admit non-zero ASR values, suggesting that their stricter filtering mechanisms trade off too much performance without completely mitigating attacks. Finally, PROMPTGUARD attains the highest clean utility (79.38%), but at the cost of very large ASR (26.03%) under IMPORTANTINSTRUCTION, demonstrating that high utility does not necessarily imply robust defense. Overall, these results emphasize the effectiveness of SIC: it is the only defense that achieves 0% ASR, while maintaining competitive utility and the strongest utility under attack. 5.3 ABLATIONS To study design choices under controlled budget, we use the IMPORTANTINSTRUCTION attack (Debenedetti et al., 2024a) and two representative models: GPT-4.1-mini and Qwen3-32B. 6 Preprint. Cleansing strategies. We compare three strategies for neutralizing imperative content: REPHRASE (rewrite to non-imperative form), MASK (replace with [PLACEHOLDER]), and REMOVE (delete). System prompts are given in Appendix B. Figure 3 shows that both models retain high clean utility; Qwen3-32B is slightly stronger but exhibits higher baseline ASR. With defenses on, clean-utility decreases modestly for Qwen, but increases for GPT-4.1-mini. Under attack, all strategies drive ASR to zero; however, utility differs: MASK yields the best utility under attack, REMOVE is more conservative, and REPHRASE performs worst due to two failure modes observed in rewrites: (1) incomplete neutralization that still triggers the classifier, and (2) over-aggressive rewriting that obscures the original task, hurting utility. (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 3: Utility and ASR for GPT-4.1-mini and Qwen3-32b across three sanitization strategies on clean inputs (with/without defense) and adversarial inputs (with defense).

Figure 5: Adversarial string that bypasses the classifier (including chunked variants) but fails against the full SIC pipeline. Rewriting loop. We next vary the number of rewrite passes (13) and measure utility on clean inputs and under attack (Figure 4a). Additional passes generally reduce clean utility (more so for GPT-4.1-mini), while slightly improving utility under attack for Qwen3-32B. This suggests tunable robustnessutility trade-off: extra passes can help with edge cases but are not needed for our current attack set, motivating the single-pass default used in the overall evaluation. Chunking mechanism. We evaluate chunked classification, where rewritten text is split and assessed per-chunk. Increasing chunks reduces clean utility due to more false positives, and slightly reduces utility under attack, yet maintains perfect robustness (0% ASR) in our setting (Figure 4b). 7 Preprint. To stress-test the classifier in isolation (without chunking), we attack it with STUBBORNREWRITER. The unchunked classifier is bypassed in 99% of synthetic cases; enabling chunking reduces this to 35% with two or three chunks, and to 25% when using both heuristics. Closer inspection shows many successful bypasses cease to be instructive after rewriting, limiting practical impact. Aggregated over the full banking suite, this translates to modest 2.78% ASR (4/144 scenarios). particularly persistent attack (partially shown in Figure 5) evades vanilla and chunked classification but fails under the combined SIC pipeline, leaving the end-to-end defense uncompromised."

            "content": "On standard benchmarks from AgentDojo, our defense consistently achieves the lowest ASR, and even under simple adaptive attack its robustness largely persists. However, similar to other detection-based methods, it is breakable; thus we apply the novel state-of-the-art adaptive attack introduced by Nasr et al. (2025). The attack is based on genetic algorithm with frontier LLM with high reasoning budget acting as mutator. This method depends on complete knowledge of the system and crafts payloads per sample, which is an unrealistic setting, yet interesting for worstcase analysis. We use GPT5-mini and run it on subset of AgentDojo similar to Nasr et al. (2025). We present the results in Table 2. We observe that SIC achieves the lowest ASR with only 15%, outperforming its second strongest competitor PIGUARD by factor of 3. First, closer analysis reveals three primary failure modes. the attack explicitly embeds directly executable workflows together with tool calls, such as JSON manifests or pseudo-code like {\"task type\":\"notification dispatch\", ...}. Interestingly, atframing the payload as task description tacks often do this in non-imperative way, or benchmark instead of direct command. This means our method, which detects imperative instructions, does not detect it. Yet, when these machine-parsable plans reach the tool-calling agent, it happily executes them. The example in Figure 6, which frames the attack as an AI Assistant Performance Benchmark, perfectly illustrates this technique. This failure case could potentially be fixed by disallowing structured tool calls or executable code within external payloads. No Defense PROTECT AI PROMPTGUARD PIGUARD MELON SIC (ours) ASR (%) Median # Queries 58 81 45 82 110 75 81 75 49 71 15 Defenses Second, many successful attacks appear in spirit very similar to system prompts. That is, they have an authority-styled language while not being strictly imperative. By using phrases like SYSTEM NOTICE: Mandatory Compliance Workflow Activated and Policy ID: ENFORCED, the attack pressures the model into treating the injected content as higher-priority directive, effectively overriding standard defenses. This authoritative framing appears to be not caught by our rewriter or detector, as it is non-instructive. We show clear example of this in Figure 7. Table 2: Genetic algorithm adaptive attack against the baseline defenses and detectors on subset of AgentDojo (same setup as Nasr et al. (2025)). Median # Queries is the median number of queries across all successful scenarios. SIC achieves the lowest ASR among all competitors at 15%, where PIGUARD achieves the second lowest at 49%. This is an improvement of 3. Third, the payload reports some system failure that needs to be fixed, which in turn justifies the next action. For instance, the message in Figure 8, [Content Rendering Error], creates need to execute an action to make something good. This framing makes the extra stepslike fetching content from the attackers provided URLlook necessary to satisfy the users original request. This encourages the assistant to continue executing follow-up operations that it might otherwise block."

The soft nature of our defense, which relies on an LLM to identify and neutralize instructions, introduces its own set of unique potential vulnerabilities. Security-Utility trade-off. key consideration is the inherent trade-off between security and utility. Even benign tool outputs can be subtly altered by the rewriting process; for instance, transforming Please pay the amount... to Payment can be made... can cause some models to fail the task. This highlights fundamental challenge: the line between benign instruction and an adversarial one can be blurry. An attacker could potentially exploit this ambiguity by crafting payloads that appear benign but have malicious intent, creating type of imperceptible prompt injection that might even deceive human reviewer. Adaptive adversary. As we have shown in Section 6, strong adaptive attacker with full knowledge of the system and the defense can craft payloads that trigger malicious tool calls. The challenge is that these payloads look innocuous in isolation and only reveal their effect in the full interaction context. This exposes generic failure mode of local, detection-based methods: reasoning over small windows misses cross-sentence dependencies and tool-use dynamics. To withstand such attacks, future SIC-like detectors must incorporate global context in sophisticated manner, while avoiding being susceptible to prompt injections or missing the interesting parts in the context. Imperfect, yet immediately useful. Despite these limitations, SIC offers pragmatic and effective approach. Unlike standard detection-based defenses that can be bypassed by static PIs, SICs multistep process of rewriting, canary checking, and chunk-based classification makes successful attacks significantly more difficult, unreliable, and expensive to execute. Our approach consciously moves away from the goal of perfect security, which has so far been elusive with model-only solutions, and instead focuses on raising the bar for attackers in practical and lightweight manner. 9 Preprint."

            "content": "In this paper we introduce SIC, pragmatic and (empirically robust) defense mechanism against prompt injection attacks targeting tool-augmented LLM agents. SIC addresses attacks with modular, multi-layered sanitization pipeline that acts as pre-processing filter. By first injecting known dummy instructions and then iteratively rewriting the input to neutralize imperative content, SIC creates difficult challenge for adversaries. The subsequent verification step, which checks for the removal of these dummy instructions and scans the full text and its chunks for any remaining commands, ensures that an attack must simultaneously evade rewriting, detection at multiple granularities, and reconstruction to succeed. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that SIC is an effective defense, achieving high attack success prevention rates while maintaining strong level of utility on legitimate tasks. While we acknowledge that SIC is not an infallible solution and that dedicated adversaries can devise methods to circumvent it, empirically, our approach significantly raises the cost and complexity of executing successful prompt injection attack for modern adaptive adversaries like AC. By making attacks less reliable and more difficult to craft, SIC provides simple, lightweight, and effective contribution toward building more secure and dependable agentic systems."

            "content": "In this section, we present the disaggregated results of the defense mechanisms, showing their performance against individual attack types without aggregation. The complete results are detailed in Figures 9 to 12. SIC consistently drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to near-zero across all models and tasks, with only minor degradation in utility. The results for the IMPORTANTINSTRUCTIONS, GUARDEDIMPORTANTINSTRUCTIONS, and IGNOREPREVIOUS attacks show that ASRs for all models are at or close to 0.0. The PIC defense is effective across all three domains tested: banking, slack, and travel. GPT-4o demonstrates the most balanced performance, pairing high clean utility with very low ASR. Other models with lower baseline robustness, such as Qwen 3 32B, Kimi K2, and GPT-4.1 Mini, also benefit substantially from the PIC defense. In contrast, other defense mechanisms like RUP and SWD show significant vulnerabilities. RUP, for instance, has high ASRs in the IMPORTANTINSTRUCTIONS and GUARDEDIMPORTANTINSTRUCTIONS scenarios, particularly in the slack domain for Qwen 3 32B and GPT-4.1 Mini. Similarly, SWD also exhibits high ASRs in these same attack types, with GPT-4.1 Mini showing an ASR over 0.7 in the banking domain under the IMPORTANTINSTRUCTIONS attack. While both RUP and SWD are effective against the IGNOREPREVIOUS attack, their failure to provide consistent protection against other attack types highlights the superiority of the SIC method.

            "title": "E STUBBORNREWRITING ATTACK",
            "content": "In this section, we describe STUBBORNREWRITING (SR), lightweight adversarial method that emerged during our experiments with detection-based sanitization pipelines. The approach adapts ideas from AC attack Shi et al. (2025a), but in simplified form with fixed critic. It is included here to illustrate the sensitivity of detect-then-rewrite defenses e.g., PromptAmor, to targeted evasion. To circumvent such an attack, it suffices to convince the detector to answer No. SR aims to construct suffixes that preserve the core malicious instruction while bypassing detection and therefore avoiding any rewriting. The method applies iterative updates based on three roles. The critic suggests how the suffix could be improved to mislead the detector. These suggestions are manually crafted and reflect intuitive strategies such as misdirection, ambiguity, or role-play. The actor incorporates the critics suggestions into the suffix using generative language model. The judge evaluates the resulting attack string if it convinces the classifier to answer No. This loop continues until suffix is found that leads the judge to confidently respond with No. At that point, the attack is considered successful. The full process is summarised below. def stubborn_rewriting(injection_stub, tool_template): attack = injection_stub for step in range(MAX_ITERS): input_text = tool_template.format(PI=attack) verdict = judge_model(input_text) #Yes\" or \"No\" if verdict.lower().startswith(\"no\"): return attack # attack successful suggestions = heuristic_critic(suffix) attack = actor_model(attack, suggestions) return attack Algorithm 12: StubbornRewriting (SR) iteratively edits suffixes using fixed heuristic suggestions. The loop halts once the judge returns No, indicating the detector would not trigger rewriting.
