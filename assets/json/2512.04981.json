Introduction The integration of large visionlanguage models (LVLMs) has driven remarkable advances in both visual fidelity and semantic alignment of recent text-to-image (T2I) models [7, 43, 4750]. Leveraging the reasoning capability of LVLMs to interpret and refine user prompts, these systems generate images that are more coherent, contextually grounded, and controllable. However, this architectural shift raises an underexplored, yet crucial question: How does integration of LVLMs into the T2I pipeline affect social bias in the generated images? This question is particularly essential as LVLM-based T2I architectures are rapidly becoming the default in userfacing generative applications that shape large-scale visual media [47, 48]. Prior studies on fairness in image generation have largely focused on earlier architectures relying on static text encoders such as CLIP [34] or T5 [35] (e.g., Stable Diffusion [36]). In contrast, LVLM-based pipelines introduce fundamentally different text-processing stage: the LVLM actively reasons over user inputs, expanding or rewriting them through hidden transformations [47, 49, 50]. We hypothesize that these internal reformulations constitute core source of social bias in LVLM-based T2I models. Because LVLMs may implicitly insert demographic attributes or contextual assumptions not present in the original prompt, their internal transformations can shift the resulting text embeddings and, consequently, the generated images. To examine this hypothesis, we conduct comprehensive comparison across wide set of recent T2I models. We introduce large-scale benchmark that spans multiple levels of prompt complexity, from short occupation prompts (e.g., botanist) to detailed scene descriptions (e.g., botanist in lush botanical garden, surrounded by an array of exotic plants and flowers...), capturing realistic variations of users diverse prompting style. With comprehensive evaluation, we find that LVLM-based models consistently exhibit substantially stronger demographic biases than their non-LVLM counterparts (Figures 1 and 2). For instance, when given neutral prompt such as botanist, LVLM-based models disproportionately generate images reflecting specific gender or ethnic attributes, whereas nonLVLM-based models produce more balanced set of outputs. These results suggest that the shift to LVLMs amplifies or reshapes the social stereotypes. To uncover the mechanisms driving this amplification, we analyze the text pipeline of LVLM in detail. central component in LVLM-based architectures is the system prompt: predefined instruction prepended to all user inputs [31, 54, 56]. Through decoded text analyses, we find that these system prompts frequently inject implicit demographic assumptions, even when user prompts do not contain any explicit attributes. Furthermore, token-level probability diagnostics and embedding-association analyses reveal that system prompts systematically skew the intermediate text representations that condition the image generator. These distortions then propagate through cross-modal attention, ultimately influencing visual appearance and demographic attributes in the synthesized images. Together, these findings provide mechanistic explanation for why LVLM-based T2I systems exhibit stronger social bias. Motivated by this insight, we introduce FAIRPRO, training-free meta-prompting framework that mitigates bias by intervening directly on the system prompt. Instead of relying on fixed instruction, FAIRPRO uses the embedded LVLM within each T2I model to self-audit the user input and generate fairness-aware system prompt tailored to the current prompt. This dynamic replacement mitigates the reinforcement of stereotypical associations introduced by the default instruction while taking advantage of the LVLMs reasoning capability. Extensive experiments across multiple demographic attributes and diverse prompt complexities demonstrate that FAIRPRO substantially reduces bias while preserving textimage alignment. In summary, our contributions are fourfold: Comprehensive study of LVLM-induced bias. We present the first large-scale analysis of social bias in recent T2I models, with focus on the unique bias patterns arising from LVLM-based architectures. Benchmark with multi-level prompt complexity. We construct systematic benchmark covering multiple demographic dimensions and varied prompt styles, enabling controlled and rigorous evaluation. Mechanistic analysis of bias propagation. We show how system prompts reshape token probabilities and text embeddings within the LVLM, tracing how these internal shifts propagate into visual outputs. Training-free mitigation via self-audited prompting. We propose FAIRPRO, simple and deployable approach that leverages the T2I models own LVLM to generate fairness-aware system prompts, substantially reducing bias while preserving generation quality. 2. Related Work 2.1. Advances in Text-to-Image Generation Text-to-image (T2I) generation has progressed from simple label-based synthesis to producing detailed and controllable visual content from natural language. This progress has largely been driven by advances in text encoders that 2 map linguistic semantics into the visual domain. Early models [33, 36] relied on CLIP [34], which captured imagetext correspondences through contrastive learning. Later works [4, 17] incorporated more expressive language models such as T5 [35]. However, these encoders still functioned as static modules that embedded prompts without contextual interpretation. Recent models [43, 4749] introduce large visionlanguage models (LVLMs) that process and refine prompts through internal reasoning. For instance, SANA [49, 50] utilizes Gemma-2-2B-IT [42], while QwenImage [47] employs Qwen-VL-7B-Instruct [3]. Our work investigates how this architectural shift influences the social bias in generated images. 2.2. Measuring and Mitigating Social Bias Many recent studies have worked on social bias in T2I models. StableBias [28] and TIBET [10] revealed demographic stereotypes in Stable Diffusion, OpenBias [15] identified open-set biases using LLMs, and BiasConnect [41] analyzed correlations between social attributes. Seshadri et al. [38] showed that such models amplify biases in training data. Mitigation efforts span text-level debiasing [12, 26], visionlanguage approaches [5, 13, 18, 22, 23, 25], language-level editing [6, 24, 27, 51, 53], and imageor data-level interventions [14, 39, 40]. Distinct from these works, our study investigates bias in the latest LVLM-based T2I architectures and introduces training-free method that mitigates bias by self-audited prompting strategy. 3. Multi-Level Benchmark for Evaluation of Social Bias in T2I Models Existing datasets for bias evaluation [10, 28, 41, 55] are limited in both scale and diversity, typically containing only around 100 prompts and roughly 50 occupations. This restricted scope constrains the ability to conduct statistically robust analyses and to capture the full range of biases exhibited by modern T2I systems. To overcome these limitations, we construct largescale benchmark comprising 1,024 unique prompts spanning multiple levels of linguistic complexity. This design is intended to better reflect real-world user behavior, where prompts range from short, simple phrases to longer and more descriptive sentences. We incorporate both neutral prompts (with no explicit attribute) and explicit prompts (with specific attributes), enabling evaluation across broad spectrum of practical usage scenarios. This hierarchical structure supports systematic examination of how model behavior evolves with prompt complexity, from minimal noun phrases to natural, context-rich narratives. Specifically, the benchmark is organized into four levels of increasing linguistic and semantic complexity, with each level containing 256 prompts: (Level 1) Occupation: Neutral prompts describing broad set of occupations (e.g., CEO), following established practice in occupational bias evaluation [6, 55]. (Level 2) Simple: Extends Level 1 by adding single demographic attribute, uniformly sampled from predefined categories (e.g., An Asian CEO). Attributes are drawn from four groups: gender (male, female), age (young, adult, old), ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern), and body type (slim, average, athletic, overweight). This level enables controlled evaluation of model sensitivity to socially salient attributes. (Level 3) Context: Builds on Level 2 by incorporating simple actions or contextual details to create semantically richer descriptions (e.g., An Asian CEO is listening to music). This level examines how bias manifests as prompts become less minimal and more situational. (Level 4) Rewritten: Automatically rewritten by large language model (LLM), Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [44, 52] from Occupation prompts to generate more descriptive and stylistically varied formulations (e.g., An Asian CEO working at desk under midday office lighting, with focused expression and city visible through the window...). This set also captures the effects of recent LLMbased rewriting techniques, providing the highest degree of linguistic diversity and complexity. Subsets of these benchmark prompts are provided in Supp. A. Given its controlled construction and systematic coverage of attribute and prompt variations, we use this benchmark as the unified evaluation protocol for all analyses and experiments in the following sections. 4. Social Bias Evaluation of T2I Models 4.1. Evaluation Setup We evaluate six recent T2I models using the proposed benchmark: two Stable Diffusion models (SD3.5-Medium and SD3.5-Large), two FLUX models (FLUX.1-dev and FLUX.1 Kontext [4]), and two LVLM-based models (SANA1.5-4.8B and Qwen-Image). Among them, QwenImage and SANA are categorized as LVLM-based T2I models because they employ Qwen-VL [3] and Gemma2 [42], respectively. For each of the 1,024 prompts described in the previous section, we generate ten images per model using fixed random seeds (0 to 9), producing 10,240 images per model. Following prior works [10, 15], we adopt an LVLMbased VQA approach rather than attribute-specific classifiers. Specifically, we employ Llama3.2-11B [1] as an independent LVLM-as-a-judge and manually verified the outputs. For gender evaluation, for example, we use the instruction: What is the perceived gender of the main person in the image? Please select the best fit from the following (a) Bias scores across demographic attributes (b) Bias under prompt complexity (c) Textimage alignment Figure 2. Social bias and alignment in LVLM-based vs. non-LVLM T2I models. We evaluate recent text-to-image models across three dimensions: overall demographic bias, bias variation under increasing prompt complexity, and textimage alignment. LVLM-based models consistently exhibit stronger social biases than non LVLM-based models. Furthermore, bias increases with prompt complexity and follows trend similar to textimage alignment. options: Male, Female, or Unknown. Answer in single word. [2]. To ensure robustness, we further validate our findings using an additional LVLM annotator, and provide the exact instructions in Supp. B. We evaluate four widely examined bias categories [9, 11, 30, 40]: age, gender, ethnicity, and appearance. For prompts that explicitly specify demographic attribute (e.g., An Asian CEO), we exclude that attribute from evaluation to ensure consistency and to assess intersectional bias. For instance, when ethnicity is provided, we evaluate only gender, age, and appearance. Metrics. Following prior studies [12, 32, 40, 45], we quantify bias using the Fair Discrepancy (FD), which measures the deviation of the empirical distribution of generated output attributes from the ideal uniform distribution. Specifically, the bias score for attribute category is defined as: Biask = 1 Sk (cid:88) iSk (cid:13) (cid:13)pi,k uk (cid:13) (cid:13)2, (1) (cid:80)S where pi,k = 1 s=1 e(yi,s) denotes the empirical atS tribute distribution for category k, Sk is the set of evaluation prompts associated with attribute k, and uk = 1 1 repreNk sents the uniform distribution over Nk classes. To ensure fair comparison across different demographic attributes, we 1 1 normalize the FD scores by scaling them with 1/ , Nk yielding values in the range [0, 1], where 0 indicates no bias, and 1 indicates maximal bias. For textimage alignment evaluation, we use the CLIP score [21], which measures the cosine similarity between image and text embeddings. (cid:113) 4.2. Results We analyze the bias of each T2I model from multiple perspectives, with results summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2a reports bias scores across four demographic attributes for all evaluated models. Across the board, bias levels remain 4 high, indicating that contemporary T2I models exhibit substantial social bias and underscoring the need for continued study. Notably, the age attribute shows the highest bias, which we attribute to the use of occupation-based prompts that naturally steer generations toward adults. Among the SD3.5 variants, the large model exhibits slightly lower bias than the medium model, and both achieve the lowest bias overall. The FLUX models show moderately higher bias, with FLUX-Kontext being the most biased within the nonLVLM group. In contrast, LVLM-based T2I models consistently produce the largest biases across attributes. QwenImage displays the highest bias in age, gender, and appearance, while SANA ranks second-highest in gender, ethnicity, and appearance. Figure 2b further presents the bias averaged across all demographic attributes for different prompt types. Across all prompt levels, Qwen-Image exhibits the highest bias, followed by SANA, with the exception of the Rewritten prompts, where their ordering slightly differs. Overall, these patterns underscore the central motivation of our study: LVLM-based T2I models exhibit markedly higher levels of social bias, making it crucial to analyze and mitigate their underlying mechanisms. Finding 1. LVLM-based T2I models exhibit greater social bias than non-LVLM-based models. Next, we analyze how prompt composition affects model bias. As shown in Figure 2b, adding explicit demographic attributes to prompts (Simple) significantly amplifies bias. Since we exclude the explicitly mentioned attribute from scoring, this indicates that models inherently possess social biases that become further amplified when the prompt references demographic traits. Adding contextual descriptions (Context) slightly increases bias for most models, likely because additional actions or situational cues introduce more semantic variability, which may allow latent demographic priors within the LVLM to influence the resulting representations. We also observe that SANA exhibits different trend, where Simple prompts yield higher bias than Context prompts. We speculate that SANA is more sensitive to intersectional or compounding demographic cues, causing its bias to intensify when explicit attributes are introduced without additional contextual grounding. Finding 2. Prompts with explicit demographic attributes amplify the social biases of T2I models. When prompts are enhanced using popular rewriting techniques [3, 49], they become substantially longer and semantically richer. Consistent with prior observations that increased prompt complexity correlates with higher bias, the Rewritten prompts exhibit further elevated bias scores, as shown in Figure 2b. This effect likely arises because complex linguistic structures inadvertently introduce stereotypical associations. In fact, we observe that the LLM-based rewriter (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct in our case) implicitly injects demographic cues during the rewriting process (examples in Supp. B). While such behavior improves textimage alignment, it amplifies social biases in the generated outputs. Figure 3. Analyzing decoded prompts. Decoded texts reveal demographic assumptions introduced by system prompts, which correlate with biases in the final generated images. duce linguistic bias, and (2) performing controlled study to assess whether disabling system prompts reduces such biases. Together, these analyses reveal how system prompts introduce and encode linguistic priors that ultimately shape downstream image generation. Finding 3. Prompt rewriting improves textimage alignment but amplifies social bias. 5.1. Preliminary: System Prompts Finally, textimage alignment across prompt complexity is shown in Figure 2c. LVLM-based models consistently achieve the highest alignment at each prompt level, confirming their strong semantic grounding. Alignment scores also increase with prompt complexity [37], with SANA ranking highest and Qwen-Image second in the Rewritten prompts. Notably, the alignment curve closely mirrors the bias trend in Figure 2b. Quantitatively, alignment and bias exhibit strong positive Pearson correlation of = 0.948 across prompt categories, indicating an almost linear relationship. This suggests that improvements in semantic alignment may come at the cost of fairness: as models encode richer prompt semantics, they also tend to internalize and reproduce implicit social stereotypes, thereby amplifying bias in the generated outputs. Finding 4. Improved textimage alignment comes at the cost of greater social bias. 5. Mechanistic Analysis of Bias Propagation Why do LVLM-based T2I models exhibit greater social bias? We hypothesize that the key factor is the use of system prompts, an inherent and distinctive component of LVLMbased T2I architectures (Section 5.1). To examine how bias emerges and propagates due to system prompts, we conduct two in-depth analyses: (1) Decoding LVLM outputs to test whether system prompts inLVLMs employed in T2I synthesis rely heavily on system prompts to guide and enrich user inputs [47, 49], which are often used for detailed image generation. For instance, SANA utilizes Complex Human Instruction (CHI)1 to enhance the user prompt by adding detailed visual and compositional specifications. Similarly, Qwen-Image adopts default system prompt designed to guide user prompts, detailing attributes such as color, size, composition, and spatial relationships. The exact system prompts and the detailed pipeline for each model are provided in Supp. C. In the following analyses, we focus on gender bias, as it offers clear and representative setting for examining how social biases emerge in generative T2I models and aligns with prior work that predominantly studies gender as primary axis of bias [6, 8, 20]. Additional results for other demographic attributes are provided in Supp. D. 5.2. System Prompts as Source of Linguistic Bias We begin by examining how bias emerges during the textprocessing stage of the LVLM. Because T2I models utilize only the encoder component of the LVLM, we decode text using the full Large Language Model (LLM) embedded within the architecture to recover its implicit reasoning behavior. We refer to these outputs as the decoded texts, generated by prompting the LVLM with the same system and user prompts used in the image generation pipeline. 1For consistency, the term system prompts is used throughout this paper to collectively refer to both CHI and system prompts. behavior. Because removing the system prompt entirely prevents the model from producing coherent decoded text, we analyze two internal signals: (1) token-level probability preferences and (2) text embedding geometry. Token probability shifts. We assess gender preference using occupation-related comparison prompts in which the model must select between male-referencing and female-referencing sentence. For each of the 256 occupations, we design multiple paraphrased templates and randomize the ordering of gendered options to mitigate position effects. Each prompt is evaluated under two conditions: with the models default system prompt and with the system prompt removed. The predicted probabilities assigned to the gendered options are aggregated across templates and used to categorize each occupation as male-skewed, femaleskewed, or neutral. Full prompt templates and implementation details are provided in Supp. D.2. Interestingly, we find that removing the system prompt produces substantial shifts toward neutrality, with 27% of previously maleassociated and 36% of previously female-associated occupations becoming neutral (Fig. 4a). This demonstrates that system prompts exert measurable influence on the models lexical-level gender preferences. Biased text embedding. We next examine whether the influence of system prompts is reflected in the semantic representations used for crossor joint-attention conditioning. Using gender concept embeddings and occupation embeddings, we quantify gender association via cosine similarity differences; full details of the computation are provided in Supp. D.3. As shown in Fig. 4b, embeddings produced under default system prompts exhibit pronounced gender associations, whereas removing the system prompt substantially attenuates these associations. This suggests that system prompts introduce and reinforce gender-specific semantics that propagate into the representations used to guide the diffusion model. Together, these findings indicate that system prompts play central role in introducing linguistic and semantic biases within LVLMs, which subsequently influence T2I generation. While removing the system prompt alleviates such effects, more principled approaches that explicitly adapt system prompts are necessary to achieve more effective debiased image generation. 6. Bias Mitigation via Self-Audited Prompting Mechanistic analyses of the previous section suggest that default system prompts are major source of social bias: induce they induce biased linguistic priors on LVLMs, skewed text embeddings, and consequently affect image synthesis. Although training-based debiasing can reduce (a) Token probability shifts (b) Change in text embedding Figure 4. Impact of system prompts on linguistic bias. We conduct controlled analysis to quantify the effect of system prompts on linguistic bias within LVLMs. Removing system prompts mitigates gender bias, as reflected in both (a) token probability distributions and (b) text representations. We hypothesize that the social biases in generated images are partly inherited from biases present in these decoded texts. To assess this, we analyze decoded outputs from Gemma2, the LVLM used in SANA,2 and examine how system prompts introduce demographic or contextual details absent from the original user prompt. To quantify the relationship between textual and visual bias, we compare demographic attributes inferred from the decoded texts with those observed in the corresponding generated images. For each prompt, we produce ten decoded responses using the same random seeds as in T2I generation, with the models default system prompt. As illustrated in Figure 3, we find that the decoded texts contain gender-related words, even when the system prompt did not contain any information to specify genders. Although perfect one-to-one correlation is not achieved, the agreement between visual and linguistic biases 3 is meaningfully high: 64%, 55%, and 53% each for occupations, simple, and context prompts. For instance, the decoded LVLM response for the user prompt farmer mentions male-related words 10 out of 10 times, and the same for the generated images showing male figures. This observation suggests that bias emerges at the linguistic stage of the generation pipeline: system prompts shape the models interpretation of user intent, injecting social priors that subsequently influence visual synthesis. Finding 5. Decoded texts show system prompts inject demographic biases that correlate with image outputs. 5.3. Controlled Study on System Prompts To further examine the role of system prompts in shaping linguistic bias, we conduct controlled study that isolates their influence on the models internal language-processing 2Qwen-VL often relies on its visual encoder even without visual input, producing responses such as can only see blank..., making it unsuitable for interpreting LVLM-encoded biases through textual output. 3A prompt is considered maleor female-biased if more than half of its 10 generated samples exhibit the corresponding gender attributes. 6 Table 1. Examples of reasoning and generated system prompts. FAIRPRO leverages the reasoning capabilities of the embedded LVLM to produce fairness-aware system prompts. The top row shows outputs from Qwen-VL of Qwen-Image, and the bottom row shows outputs from Gemma2 of SANA. Table 2. Comparison of bias across attributes. We measure the bias score under the default and none settings, averaged across all dataset. FAIRPRO consistently achieves the lowest bias across all attributes for both models. User prompt An accountant dental assistant Reasoning about bias Output system prompt are ...Accountants often stereotypically portrayed as male in many cultures.

Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid gender stereotypes. bias, it often overfits to predefined attribute classes [19] and yields prompts with limited interpretability [16]. single static system prompt is also insufficient to generalize across the diverse forms of social bias  (Table 4)  . Explicit user specification (e.g., female botanist) is likewise impractical, as users rarely provide demographic attributes for neutral prompts, expecting demographic diversity by default, or may be unaware of underlying biases. Hence, user-side intervention cannot serve as reliable fairness mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose FAIRPRO, an adaptive test-time debiasing method that dynamically optimizes the system prompt based on the user input. Leveraging recent advances in meta-prompting, FAIRPRO performs self-auditing step in which the LVLM identifies the potential bias and then generates fairness-aware system prompt to replace the default instruction, enabling input-adaptive and interpretable debiasing. 6.1. Our FAIRPRO Given user prompt u, LVLM-based T2I models prepend fixed system prompt sdefault and feed the concatenated text [sdefault; u] into the text encoder to obtain an embedding that conditions the image generator. In contrast, FAIRPRO replaces this static instruction with self-generated, fairness-aware system prompt sfair, defined as: sfair = LVLM(cid:0)promptmeta, u(cid:1), (2) where promptmeta is meta-instruction that guides the LVLM to reflect on potential biases in its default system prompt and to produce fair and stereotype-aware reformulation. It is important to note that FAIRPRO leverages the embedded LVLM of each T2I system (e.g., Gemma2 [42] 7 Model Method Gender Age Ethnicity Appearance Mean SANA1.5-4.8B Qwen-Image Default None FAIRPRO Default None FAIRPRO 0.906 0.916 0.771 0.925 0.917 0.816 0.946 0.942 0.933 0.978 0.966 0.958 0.828 0.799 0. 0.826 0.809 0.741 0.823 0.811 0.745 0.878 0.866 0.859 0.876 0.867 0.790 0.902 0.890 0.844 Table 3.

To fully leverage the LVLMs reasoning capability, the meta-instruction is designed to induce explicit chain-ofthought (CoT) reasoning [46]. This design is also motivated by self-improvement paradigms in which models refine their own outputs through structured self-feedback [29]. Specifically, the LVLM is first asked to identify possible social stereotypes or biases that could arise from the given user prompt. Based on this reasoning, it then reconstructs revised system prompt that mitigates those biases while maintaining the semantic intent of the original input. Notably, our approach requires only single invocation of the LVLM, introducing minimal inference-time overhead. Table 1 presents excerpts of the intermediate reasoning and revised system prompt, while exact meta instructions and implementation details are provided in Supp. E.1. The resulting fairness-aware system prompt sfair is concatenated with the user prompt and encoded by the LVLM to obtain the final text embedding: efair = ftext (cid:0)[sfair; u](cid:1). (3) The downstream image generation model then proceeds as usual, conditioned on efair. 6.2. Experiments To evaluate the effectiveness of FAIRPRO, we measure both bias and alignment scores across the full benchmark using Figure 5. Qualitative comparison. While the default system prompt tends to produce demographically biased outputs, our proposed FAIRPRO method generates individuals with greater diversity, even when explicit demographic attributes are specified. Furthermore, FAIRPRO maintains demographic diversity and prompt coherence even under long and complex prompts. Best viewed zoomed in. two LVLM-based models: SANA and Qwen-Image. Quantitative results. Table 2 summarizes the bias reduction results, with bias scores reported for each attribute category. FAIRPRO consistently achieves the lowest bias scores across both models for every demographic attribute, outperforming both the default system prompt and nosystem prompt baseline. Table 3 further reports performance across prompts of varying complexity. Across all prompt types, FAIRPRO yields the lowest bias scores, exhibiting only minor decrease in alignment for SANA while maintaining alignment performance for Qwen-Image. Qualitative results. Figure 1 presents qualitative comparisons, illustrating that FAIRPRO generates individuals with diverse demographic attributes across both models for the prompt botanist from the Occupation dataset. More qualitative examples are shown in Figure 5, comparing results across Simple, Context, and Rewritten prompts (from left to right). While the default system prompt tends to produce demographically biased outputs, our method generates individuals with greater diversity, even when explicit demographic attributes are specified. For instance, when prompted with female data engineer, FAIRPRO generates individuals encompassing diverse ethnicities and visual characteristics, while preserving the female gender as explicit. Moreover, FAIRPRO consistently maintains both demographic diversity and semantic fidelity, even under long and complex prompts, yielding outputs reflecting varied ages and ethnicities. We provide more results in Supp. E. Ablation study. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in FAIRPRO. Fixed, hand-crafted prompts that directly request fairness-aware system prompt yield only minimal bias reduction.

Consequently, we adopt the CoT-based single-call design as the most efficient and effective configuration. Full system instructions and additional details are provided in Supp. E.3. 7. Discussion Limitations. As an input-level intervention, our approach can mitigate but not fully remove internal model biases. While deeper methods such as fine-tuning or concept removal can modify latent representations, they require additional data, significant computational cost, and may introduce unintended behavioral shifts. Our method prioritizes practical, deployment-friendly mitigation strategy. Moreover, our analysis of gender-related bias relies on VLMbased perceived-gender annotations, limiting evaluation to binary categories. Future work may incorporate more inclusive and nuanced attribute annotations. Conclusion. In this work, we presented the first systematic and large-scale investigation of social bias in contemporary T2I systems. We found that LVLM-based models exhibit markedly stronger and more structured 8 demographic biases than those built on traditional text encoders. Through multi-level benchmark and mechanistic analysis, we demonstrated that system prompts, an intrinsic yet often under-examined component of LVLM pipelines, serve as primary contributor to bias, introducing implicit demographic assumptions and reshaping intermediate textual representations that guide image synthesis. Building on these insights, we proposed FAIRPRO, training-free framework that leverages the LVLMs reasoning ability to identify the potential biases and generate the fairness-aware system prompts, achieving substantial bias reduction while preserving textimage alignment. We hope this work contributes to deeper understanding of bias propagation in LVLM-based generative models and building socially responsible T2I systems."

            "content": "B.2. Examples of injecting demographic stereotypes The sections of supplementary material are structured as follows: Section presents illustrative examples from our benchmark dataset. Section details our evaluation pipeline for recent T2I models. Section describes the system prompt processing pipeline of LVLM-based T2I models, specifically SANA and Qwen-Image. Section outlines the setup for the mechanistic analysis and provides additional experimental results. Section provides implementation details for our FAIRPRO and presents an ablation study supporting our design choices. Section reports additional experimental results on other datasets (e.g., TIBET [10]) and explores alternatives to revising user prompts. The Rewritten prompts take the Occupation prompts as input. However, we observe that when generated using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [44, 52], neutral inputs often result in Rewritten prompts that include demographic attributes. Examples are shown in Table 15, where gender (e.g., his, woman) or age (e.g., late 40s) are inadvertently injected. C. Pipeline of System Prompts Default system prompts for each model are provided in Table 16. For SANA, the complex human instruction consists of list of strings that acts as prompt-enhancement directive for the Gemma text encoder. This instruction serves as meta-prompt, guiding the encoder to expand users simple prompt into more detailed and descriptive formulation prior to embedding. For Qwen-Image, the whole prompt is structured as folA. Our Benchmark Dataset lows: We provide example prompts for each level of our benchmark dataset in Tables 10, 11, 12, and 13. All datasets containing 1,024 prompts can be found at our project page. B. Evaluating Bias of T2I Models B.1. Evaluation with different judge of ensure results performance our findings, we consistency report To adusing ditionally OpenGVLab/InternVL3-8B [57] as LVLM-asa-Judge. As shown in Tables 5 and 14, our main claims remain consistent, indicating that the current evaluation setup is sufficient for accurately assessing human attributes, including gender, race, age, and appearance, from the generated images. Table 5. Comparison of bias scores across attributes evaluated using InternVL3. This table summarizes the normalized fairness discrepancy (FD) scores for various T2I models. LLM-based T2I models, Qwen-Image, and SANA1.5-4.8B show the highest bias scores among all the methods. Additionally, similar to the main text results, adding the prompt complexity results in higher bias scores. The Mean column shows the average of normalized scores per row.

Thus, although the system instruction is not directly included in the final embeddings, it shapes the encoding process and influences the resulting representations. D. More Results of Mechanistic Analysis D.1. Linguistic bias in decoded texts We examine the distribution of social bias-related words from the decoded text when LVLM (i.e., Gemma2 [42]) was prompted with the default system prompts used in the T2I generation pipeline. On top of the gender-related words from the main paper, Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of age (Figure 6a) and ethnicity (Figure 6b)-related words. Table 17 contains the entire word candidates for generating the distribution. This suggests that the inherently embedded system prompts could inadvertently induce bias-encoded prompts, subsequently affecting the generated image to be skewed to specific demographic attributes. D.3. Text embedding analysis In the main paper, we examined whether the influence of system prompts extends to the semantic representations that condition image generation through cross (or joint) attention. Here, we specifically explain the detailed procedure. Let e(x) Rd denote the normalized text embedding of token sequence of prompt. We define gender concept embeddings as the mean of gender-related terms: gm = 1 Gm (cid:88) wGm e(w), gf = 1 Gf (cid:88) wGf e(w), (6) where Gm = {male, man, boy, he, him, his} and Gf = {female, woman, girl, she, her, hers}. For each occupation description o, we compute its normalized embedding = e(o) and define the gender bias measure as: B(o) = cos(gm, o) cos(gf , o), (7) where positive values indicate male association, negative values indicate stronger female association, and overall bias is measured by E[B(o)]. E. Details of FAIRPRO E.1. Implementation details We provide the exact meta instructions used as inputs to the LVLMs for each model in Table 19. As described in the main paper, these meta instructions are designed to elicit chain-of-thought reasoning from the LVLM, enabling it to identify potential biases and subsequently generate revised system prompts. All experiments in this work are conducted using temperature of 0.7. E.2. More experimental results We additionally assess the diversity of the generated images across different T2I generation models (see Tables 6 and 7). Similar to the result trend of bias scores, we observe that the LVLM-based T2I generation model, Qwen-Image, attains the overall lowest diversity in terms of both CLIP Score [21] and LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) across images. Note that we sample image pairs four times for each prompt, resulting in 1,024 data instances (per model and prompt types). Furthermore, we provide more qualitative results in Figure 7a and 7b. As can be seen from the figures, our FAIRPRO consistently produces diverse individuals while adhering to the given user prompt, for both SANA and QwenImage. (5) E.3. Ablation study details We provide details of each setting in the ablation study table in the main paper, where we confirmed every component of our FAIRPRO. Note that the meta instructions can be found in Table 19. (a) Age-related word distribution (b) Ethnicity-related word distribution Figure 6. Analyzing decoded prompts. Decoded texts reveal demographic assumptions introduced by system prompts, which correlate with biases in the final generated images. D.2. Token probability analysis One of the analyses in the main text to investigate the effects of system prompts was to probe the token probability across prompts. We provide more details as follows: Let (pθ(y x) denote the models next-token probability for label {A, B} given prompt x. For each occupation o, we generate set of templated prompts {xt(o)} where each template contrasts phrasing that refers to man with phrasing that refers to woman, and each option is annotated with its corresponding gender label (i.e., corresponds to male or female depending on the template, full templates in Table 18). Given prompt xt(o), we compute the models gender preference as the difference in first-token probabilities: Bt(o) = pθ(y = xt(o) pθ(y = xt(o), (4) where positive values indicate preference toward the option marked as male (m) and negative values indicate preference toward the option marked as female (f). For each occupation, the overall bias score is obtained by averaging across all templates: B(o) = 1 (cid:88) t=1 Bt(o), and aggregate gender bias is reported as the expectation of the absolute bias magnitude, Eo[ B(o) ], over all occupations. (a) Results of FAIRPRO on SANA Figure 7. Qualitative comparison with SANA and Qwen-Image. Our FAIRPRO method consistently produces more demographically diverse individuals than the default system prompts, even when explicit demographic attributes are specified. (b) Results of FAIRPRO on Qwen-Image Table 6. Diversity scores across prompt complexity levels. Lower is more diverse for CLIP, and higher is more diverse for LPIPS. Qwen-Image shows the lowest diversity among all the models. The Mean column shows the mean of the four values per row. Table 7. Diversity scores across prompt complexity levels.

Experiments on previous dataset To validate FAIRPRO on the existing prompt dataset, we provide the bias scores using 100 original prompts from TIBET [10] in Table 8. Consistent with the results from the main text, our FAIRPRO achieves the best bias scores among the baselines for both Qwen-Image and SANA1.5-4.8B. Table 8. Comparison of bias across attributes on TIBET. We measure the bias score () under the default and none settings, averaged across all datasets. FAIRPRO consistently achieves the lowest bias across all attributes for both models. The Mean column shows the average of normalized scores per row. Model Method Gender Age Ethnicity Appear.

We introduce FAIRPRO, selfmeta-prompting framework that adaptively generates bias-aware system prompts by identifying potential biases in given user prompt. natural question that arises is whether simply modifying the user prompt could achieve similar effects. To evaluate this possibility, we conduct an additional experiment in which the LVLM directly rewrites the user prompt. The pipeline remains identical to that of FAIRPRO, except that the model is instructed to output modified user prompt rather than revised system prompt. Thus, the default system prompt is preserved while only the user prompt is altered. As shown in Table 9, this approach provides no clear benefit. For instance, the prompt doctor is rewritten as healthcare professional in diverse settings. Although such reformulations slightly improve alignmentprimarily due to increased prompt length, consistent with the trend in Figure 2(c)they do not reduce bias. These findings reinforce both the rationale and the effectiveness of FAIRPRO, which targets system-level instructions rather than user-level prompt rewriting. 15 Table 10.
