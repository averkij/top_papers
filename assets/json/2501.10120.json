Corresponding author. 1 Academic paper search lies at the core of research yet represents particularly challenging information retrieval task. It requires long-tail specialized knowledge, comprehensive survey-level coverage, and the ability to address fine-grained queries. For instance, consider the query: \"Which studies have focused on non-stationary reinforcement learning using value-based methods, specifically UCB-based algorithms?\" While widely used academic search systems like Google Scholar are effective for general queries, they often fall short when addressing these complex queries (Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2020). Consequently, researchers frequently spend substantial time conducting literature surveys (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021). The advancements in large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Gemini, 2023; Yang et al., 2024) have inspired numerous studies leveraging LLMs to enhance information retrieval, particularly by refining or reformulating search queries to improve retrieval quality (Alaofi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). In academic search, however, the process goes beyond simple retrieval. Human researchers not only use search tools, but also engage in deeper activities, such as reading relevant papers and checking citations, to perform comprehensive and accurate literature surveys. Figure 1: Architecture of PaSa. The system consists of two LLM agents, Crawler and Selector. The Crawler processes the user query and can access papers from the paper queue. It can autonomously invoke the search tool, expand citations, or stop processing of the current paper. All papers collected by the Crawler are appended to the paper queue. The Selector reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the criteria specified in the user query. In this paper, we introduce PaSa, novel paper search agent designed to mimic human behavior for comprehensive and accurate academic paper searches. As illustrated in Figure 1, PaSa consists of two LLM agents: the Crawler and the Selector. For given user query, the Crawler can autonomously collect relevant papers by utilizing search tools or extracting citations from the current paper, which are then added to growing paper queue. The Crawler iteratively processes each paper in the paper queue, navigating citation networks to discover increasingly relevant papers. The Selector carefully reads each paper in the paper queue to determine whether it meets the requirements of the user query. We optimize PaSa within the AGILE, reinforcement learning (RL) framework for LLM agents (Feng et al., 2024). Effective training requires high-quality academic search data. Fortunately, human scientists have already created vast amount of high-quality academic papers, which contain extensive surveys on wide range of research topics. We build synthetic but high-quality academic search dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which collects fine-grained scholar queries and their corresponding relevant papers from the related work sections of papers published at ICLR 2023 1, ICML 2023 2, NeurIPS 2023 3, ACL 2024 4, and CVPR 2024 5. AutoScholarQuery includes 33,511 / 1,000 / 1,000 query-paper pairs in the training / development / test split. 1https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023 2https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023 3https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023 4https://2024.aclweb.org/ 5https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024 Although AutoScholarQuery only provides query and paper answers, without demonstrating the path by which scientists collect the papers, we can utilize them to perform RL training to improve PaSa. In addition, we design new session-level PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017)) training method to address the unique challenges of the paper search task: 1) sparse reward: The papers in AutoScholarQuery are collected via citations, making it smaller subset of the actual qualified paper set. 2) long trajectories: The complete trajectory of the Crawler may involve hundreds of papers, which is too long to directly input into the LLM context. To evaluate PaSa, besides the test set of AutoScholarQuery, we also develop benchmark, RealScholarQuery. It contains 50 real-world academic queries with annotated relevant papers, to assess PaSa in real-world scenarios. We compare PaSa with several baselines including Google, Google Scholar, Google paired with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT4o), GPT-o1 and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa agent realized by prompting GPT-4o). Our experiments show that PaSa-7b significantly outperforms all baselines. Specifically, for AutoScholarQuery test set, PaSa7b achieves 34.05% improvement in Recall@20 and 39.36% improvement in Recall@50 compared to Google with GPT-4o, the strongest Googlebased baseline. PaSa-7b surpasses PaSa-GPT-4o by 11.12% in recall, with similar precision. For RealScholarQuery, PaSa-7b outperforms Google with GPT-4o by 37.78% in Recall@20 and 39.90% in Recall@50. PaSa-7b surpasses PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: We introduce PaSa, comprehensive and accurate paper search agent that can autonomously use online search tools, read entire papers, and navigate citation networks. We develop two high-quality datasets for complex academic search, AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery. Although PaSa is trained solely on synthetic data, it achieves remarkable real-world performance. Experiments demonstrate that PaSa, built on 7B LLM, significantly outperforms all baselines, including GPT-4 agent, Googlebased search, and chatGPT."

            "content": "LLMs in Scientific Discovery LLMs have been applied across various stages of scientific discovery (Van Noorden and Perkel, 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Messeri and Crockett, 2024; Liao et al., 2024), such as brainstorming ideas (Girotra et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Baek et al., 2024), designing experiments (M. Bran et al., 2024), writing code (Xu et al., 2022), and generating research papers (Shao et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). One of the most fundamental yet critical stages in research is conducting academic surveys. Despite its importance, current tools like Google Scholar are often insufficient, leading researchers to spend considerable time on literature review tasks (Kingsley et al., 2011; Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2021, 2020). This challenge motivates us to develop PaSa, an LLM agent designed to autonomously and comprehensively assist researchers in collecting relevant research papers for complex scholarly queries. LLM Agents LLM Agents combine LLMs with memory, tool use, and planning, enabling them to perform more complex tasks such as personal copilots (Stratton, 2024), travel planning (Gundawar et al., 2024), web operations (Deng et al., 2024), software development (Qian et al., 2023), and scientific experimentation (Bran et al., 2023). In addition to realizing LLM Agents through prompt engineering (Park et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), recent research has focused on optimizing and training these agents (Feng et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Among these efforts, AGILE (Feng et al., 2024), reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents, allows the joint optimization of all agent skills in an end-to-end manner. In our work, we adopt the AGILE framework to implement PaSa. Specifically, we design novel session-level PPO algorithm to address the unique challenges of the paper search task, including sparse rewards and long trajectories."

To construct AutoScholarQuery, we began by collecting all papers published at ICLR 2023, ICML 2023, NeurIPS 2023, ACL 2024, and CVPR 2024. For the Related Work section of each paper, we prompted GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) to generate scholarly queries, where the answers to these queries correspond to the references cited in the Related Work section. The prompt used is shown in Appendix E.1. For each query, we retained only the papers that could be retrieved on arXiv6, using their arxiv_id as the unique article identifier in the dataset. We adopt the publication date of the source paper as the query date. During both training and testing, we only considered papers published prior to the query date. The final AutoScholarQuery dataset comprises 33,551, 1,000, and 1,000 instances in the training, development, and testing splits, respectively. Each instance consists of query, the associated paper set, and the query date, with queries in each split derived from distinct source papers. Table 1 provides illustrative examples from AutoScholarQuery, while additional dataset statistics are summarized in Table 2. To evaluate the quality of AutoScholarQuery, we sampled 100 query-paper pairs and assessed the rationality and relevance of each query and the corresponding paper. qualified query should be meaningful and unambiguous. qualified paper should match the requirements of the scholarly query. The author manually reviewed each pair, determining that 94.0% of the queries were qualified. Among these qualified queries, 93.7% had corresponding papers that were deemed relevant and appropriate. 6https://arxiv.org/ 3 Query: Could you provide me some studies that proposed hierarchical neural models to capture spatiotemporal features in sign videos?

After launching the demo of PaSa, we invited several AI researchers to use the system. From the queries they provided, we randomly sampled subset of queries and manually filtered out overly broad topics (e.g., \"multi-modal large language models,\" \"video generation\"). Ultimately, we collected 50 fine-grained and realistic queries. For each query, we first manually gathered relevant papers. Subsequently, we used multiple methods to retrieve additional papers, including PaSa, Google, Google Scholar, ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), and Google paired with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries. The results from these methods were aggregated into pool of candidate papers. Finally, professional annotators reviewed all candidate papers for each query, selecting those that"

            "content": "4.1 Overview As illustrated in Figure 1, the PaSa system consists of two LLM agents: Crawler and Selector. The crawler reads the users query, generates multiple search queries, and retrieves relevant papers. The retrieved papers are added to paper queue. The Crawler further processes each paper in the paper queue to identify key citations worth exploring further, appending any newly relevant papers to the paper list. The selector conducts thorough review of each paper in the paper list to assess whether it fulfills the users query requirements. In summary, the Crawler is designed to maximize the recall of relevant papers, whereas the Selector emphasizes precision in identifying papers that meet the users needs. 4 Figure 2: An example of the PaSa workflow. The Crawler runs multiple [Search] using diverse and complementary queries. In addition, the Crawler can evaluate the long-term value of its actions. Notably, it discovers many relevant papers as it explores deeper on the citation network, even when intermediate papers along the path do not align with the user query. Name Implementation [Search] [Expand] Generate search query and invoke the search tool. Append all resulting papers to the paper queue. Generate subsection name, then add all referenced papers in the subsection to the paper queue. [Stop] Reset the context to the user query and the next paper in the paper queue. Table 3: Functions of the Crawler. 4.2 Crawler In RL terminology, the Crawler performs tokenlevel Markov Decision Process (MDP). The action space corresponds to the LLMs vocabulary, where each token represents an action. The LLM functions as the policy model. The agents state is defined by the current LLM context and the paper queue. The Crawler operates with three registered functions, as outlined in Table 3. When an action matches function name, the corresponding function is executed, further modifying the agents state. For example, as Figure 2 shows, the agent begins by receiving user query, incorporating it into its context, and initiating actions. If the token generated is [Search], the LLM continues to generate search query, and the agent invokes search tool to retrieve papers, which are then added to the paper list. If the token is [Expand], the LLM continues to extract subsection name from the current paper in its context. The agent subsequently uses parsing tool to extract all referenced papers within that subsection, adding them to the paper list. If the token is [Stop], the agent resets its context to the user query and information of the next paper in the paper queue. This information includes the title, abstract, and an outline of all sections and subsections. The training process for the Crawler comprises two stages. In the first stage, we generate trajectories for small subset of the training data and then perform imitation learning (see Appendix A.1 for details). In the second stage, reinforcement learning is applied. The details of the RL training implementation are described below. Reward Design We conduct RL training on the AutoScholarQuery training set, where each instance consists of query and corresponding paper set P. Starting with query q, the Crawler generates trajectory τ = (s1, a1, , sT , aT ). At each time step t, we denote the current paper queue as Qt. Upon taking action at, the Crawler appends set of new papers (p1, p2, , pnt) to the paper queue. If at = [Stop], the set is empty. The reward of executing action at in state st is defined as r(st, at) = α nt(cid:88) i=1 I(q, pi, t) c(at), (1) where I(q, pi, t) = 1 if pi matches the query and is not already in Qt, and I(q, pi, t) = 0 otherwise. 5 Here, α is reward coefficient, and c(at) is the cost of action at. The indicator function I(q, pi, t) can be determined by checking if pi belongs to Qt. However, it is important to note that the AutoScholarQuery may only include subset of the groundtruth papers, as citations often emphasize limited number of key references. If the Crawler receives rewards solely based on matching papers in AutoScholarQuery, this could lead to sparse rewards during training. To mitigate this, we use the Selector as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler. The revised definition of I(q, pi, t) is: Here, γ0 is the in-session discount factor, and ˆVϕ() γ1 is the across-session discount factor. is the value function model to approximate the state value. After executing at+k, the paper queue is updated to include the newly found papers (p1, p2, , pnt+k ). Since the Crawler will subsequently initiate new sessions to process these additional papers, their associated reward-to-go should be incorporated into the return estimate. In addition, we include per-token KL penalty term from the learned policy πθ to the initial policy πsft obtained through imitation learning at each token to mitigate over-optimization. This term is scaled by the coefficient β. 1, I(q, pi, t) = and pi / Qt, 0, otherwise. if (Selector(q, pi) = 1 or pi P) Then the advantage function can be approxi- (2) mated by Here Selector(q, pi) = 1 if paper pi is identified as correct to meet the query by the Selector, and Selector(q, pi) = 0 otherwise. RL Training key challenge in training the Crawler with RL is the significant time required to sample complete trajectory for given query. This is due to each [Search] or [Expand] action adding multiple papers to the paper list, resulting in hundreds or even thousands of papers in the final paper queue. To address this issue, we define session as sub-trajectory that begins with sessions initial state and ends with the [Stop] action. We identify two types of session initial states: Sq, which includes only query, and Sq+p, which consists of both query and paper. ˆA(st, at) = ˆRt ˆVϕ(st). (4) Finally, the policy and value objectives can be given by Lpolicy(θ) = τ πold θ (cid:34) min (cid:18) πθ(atst) πold θ (atst) ˆA(st, at), (5) clip (cid:16) πθ(atst) πold θ (atst) , 1 ϵ, 1 + ϵ (cid:17) ˆA(st, at) (cid:19)(cid:35) and Lvalue(ϕ) = τ πold θ (cid:34) (cid:18)(cid:16) ˆRt ˆVϕ(st) max (cid:17)2 , (6) (cid:16) ˆRt ˆV clip ϕ (st) (cid:17)2(cid:19)(cid:35) , into sequence of Formally, we model the Crawler as policy πθ(atst). We partition the entire trajectory τ sessions: (τt1:t21, τt2:t31, ). is τti:ti+11 (sti, ati, , sti+11, ati+11), where the initial state sti is either belonging to type Sq or Sq+p, and the final action ati+11 is [STOP]. session Each = respectively, where ˆV clip ϕ (st) = clip (cid:16) ˆVϕ(st), old ϕ (st) ϵ, old ϕ (st) + ϵ (cid:17) . (7) θ and old is used for sampling and τ is Here, πold session trajectory. We then combine these into the unified RL loss: ϕ Sampling such sub-trajectory from these session initial states is computationally efficient. During the PPO training, at time step [ti, ti+1), we estimate the return in the session using Monte Carlo sampling: LRL(θ, ϕ) = Lpolicy(θ) + η Lvalue(ϕ) (8) where η is the coefficient of the value objective. 4.3 Selector ˆRt = ti+11t (cid:88) (cid:20) γk k=0 r(st+k, at+k) (3) +γ1 nt+k (cid:88) j= ˆVϕ(Sq+pj ) β log (cid:21) πθ(atst) πsft(atst) The Selector is an LLM agent that takes two inputs: scholar query and research paper (including its title and abstract). It generates two outputs: (1) single decision token d, either \"True\" or \"False\", indicating whether the paper satisfies the query, 6 and (2) rationale = (r1, r2, ..., rm) containing tokens that support this decision. The rationale serves two purposes: enhancing decision accuracy by jointly training the model to generate decisions and explanations, and improving user trust by providing the reasoning in PaSa application. To optimize training efficiency for the Crawler, the decision token is presented before the rationale, allowing the Selector to act as single-token reward model during the Crawler training. Additionally, the token probability of the decision token can be used to rank search results. At last, as shown in Table 7, the order of the decision and rationale does not affect the Selectors performance. We perform imitation learning to optimize the Selector. See Appendix for training data collection and training details."

For Google-based baselines, we evaluate recall using Recall@20, Recall@50, and Recall@100 metrics for the top-20, top-50, and top-100 search results, respectively. For other baselines, we assess precision and recall for the final retrieved papers. Additionally, we compare the crawlers recall between PaSa-GPT-4o and PaSa-7b. 5.3 Main results As shown in Table 5, PaSa-7b outperforms all baselines on AutoScholarQuery test set. Specifically, compared to the strongest baseline, PaSa-GPT-4o, PaSa-7b demonstrates 9.64% improvement in recall with comparable precision. Moreover, the recall of the Crawler in PaSa-7b is 3.66% higher than that in PaSa-GPT-4o. When compared to the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa7b achieves an improvement of 33.80%, 38.83% and 42.64% in Recall@20, Recall@50 and Recall@100, respectively. We observe that using multiple ensembles of Crawler during inference can improve performance. Specifically, running Crawler twice during inference increased the Crawler recall by 3.34% on AutoScholarQuery, leading to the final recall improvement by 1.51%, with precision remaining similar. To evaluate PaSa in more realistic setting, we assess its effectiveness on RealScholarQuery. As illustrated in Table 6, PaSa-7b exhibits greater advantage in real-world academic search scenarios. Compared to PaSa-GPT-4o, PaSa-7b achieves improvements of 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. Against the best Google-based baseline on RealScholarQuery, Google with GPT-4o, PaSa7b outperforms Google by 37.78%, 39.90%, and 39.83% in recall@20, recall@50 and recall@100, respectively. Additionally, the PaSa-7b-ensemble further enhances crawler recall by 4.32%, contributing to an overall 3.52% improvement in the recall of the entire agent system. As both the final decision-maker and auxiliary reward model in RL training for the Crawler, the performance of the Selector is crucial. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected dataset of 200 query-paper pairs, annotating whether each paper meets the querys requirements. This dataset serves as the benchmark for evaluating the Selector (see Appendix for details). We then compared our Selector against GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and Qwen-2.5-7b (Yang et al., 2024), as shown in Table 7. The results show that our Selector achieves an F1 score of 85%, outperforming GPT-4o by 5% and Qwen-2.5-7b by 30%. Additionally, when compared to setting where reasoning precedes decision token generation, the performance is comparable. Lastly, the Selectors precision reaches 95%, confirming its effectiveness as an auxiliary reward model for the Crawler RL training. Method Precision Recall F1 GPT-4o Qwen-2.5-7b PaSa-7b-Selector PaSa-7b-Selector (Reason First) 0.96 1.0 0.95 0.94 0.69 0.38 0.78 0.76 0.80 0.55 0.85 0.84 Table 7: Selector Evaluation. 5.4 Ablation study We perform ablation studies in Table 8 to evaluate the individual contributions of exploring citation networks, RL training, and using the Selector as the reward model. The results indicate that removing the [Expand] action from the Crawler leads to significant drop in the recall: decrease of 22.98% on AutoScholarQuery and 32.21% on RealScholarQuery. Furthermore, RL training enhances recall by 6.24% on AutoScholarQuery and 19.96% on RealScholarQuery. The RL training curves are depicted in Figure 3, where the training curves show steady increase in return with the training steps, eventually converging after 200 steps. Finally, removing the Selector as an auxiliary reward model results in 3.76% recall drop on AutoScholarQuery and 9.63% drop on RealScholarQuery. We investigate how to control agent behavior by adjusting the rewards in RL training. Experiments are conducted with varying reward coefficients α in Equation 1, and results are presented in Table 9. We report two metrics: crawler recall and crawler action. The crawler action refers to the total number of [Search] and [Expand] actions throughout the 9 Crawlers entire trajectory. As the reward increases, both crawler recall and crawler action increase, suggesting that adjusting rewards in RL training can effectively influence PaSas behavior.

            "content": "In this paper, we introduce PaSa, novel paper search agent designed to provide comprehensive and accurate results for complex academic queries. PaSa is implemented within the AGILE, reinforcement learning framework for LLM agents. To train PaSa, we developed AutoScholarQuery, dataset of fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers drawn from top-tier AI conference publications. To evaluate PaSa in real-world scenarios, we also constructed RealScholarQuery, dataset of actual academic queries paired with annotated papers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaSa outperforms all baselines, including Google, Google Scholar, and Google with GPT-4o, ChatGPT, GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o. In particular, PaSa-7B surpasses Google with GPT-4o by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50, while also exceeding PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision. These findings underscore PaSa significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of academic search.
