Our key observations are: (1) Directly applying SFT on this dataset leads to performance degradation compared to the base model. (2) While RLVR can improve generalization over SFT, the gains are marginal. (3) Our proposed SRL method substantially outperforms these baselines, and the SRL RLVR pipeline achieves the highest performance, overcoming the challenges of training on difficult data. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across range of reasoning tasks, including solving math problems (Wang et al., 2025), generating code (Jiang et al., 2024), and agent planning (Li et al., 2025c; Xie et al., 2024). significant recent advancement comes from leveraging Corresponding author(s): yihedeng@g.ucla.edu, {ihunghsu, chenyulee}@google.com * Equal contribution. This work was done while the author interned at Google Cloud AI Research. Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs complex reasoning abilities (Ahmadian et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024). By optimizing models with reward signals based on verifiable outcomes, such as the correctness of final answer, RL offers scalable and promising path to elicit beneficial problem-solving strategies such as self-reflection (Guo et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025). The effectiveness of these outcome-based RL methods fundamentally depends on the policy models ability to discover correct solutions within limited rollout budget (Brown et al., 2024). However, given practical computational constraints, this learning paradigm struggles on challenging problems from the training data, where the models success rate is effectively zero (when the pass@𝑘 rate remains zero even after sampling 𝑘 rollouts). Such cases are increasingly common in tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning (Wang et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2025). For these problems, an incorrect intermediate step can derail the entire reasoning chain for 7B-scale LLM, resulting negative learning signals regardless of any partially correct solutions. Furthermore, naively penalizing all incorrect final outputs can further introduce training instability and hinder progress, making these difficult reasoning tasks largely intractable for standard outcome-based RL methods (Xiong et al., 2025). An alternative approach is imitation learning, commonly implemented via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert demonstrations (Ross et al., 2011). While SFT can instill valuable reasoning behaviors, its next-token prediction objective enforces rigid, token-level imitation, limiting the models ability to generalize beyond the training data. This problem becomes particularly pronounced when training data are modest in scale and when the model itself is relatively less capable. Under such conditions, long and complex demonstrations often lead to overfitting and shallow reasoning behaviors (Chu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025b), as illustrated by the performance decline in our Figure 1. Consequently, both SFT and outcome-based RL struggle on challenging reasoning tasks, leaving critical gap for training small open-source models to effectively learn difficult problems. To address this gap, we introduce Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), framework that reformulates problem-solving as sequential decision-making process. Rather than optimizing for final answer or imitating an entire expert trajectory, SRL trains the model to reproduce the sequence of key actions underlying expert reasoning, following an RL-style objective. Specifically, expert demonstrations are decomposed into series of intermediate actions, each representing meaningful decision step. During training, the model first generates an internal monologue to articulate its reasoning and then commits to an action. At every step, SRL provides reward based on the similarity between the models predicted action and the corresponding expert action, thereby providing fine-grained, efficiently computable supervision that scales to large datasets. Our work makes the following contributions: We propose SRL, novel framework designed to enable effective learning on difficult reasoning tasks where SFT and RLVR struggle, by providing dense and smooth rewards based on similarity with expert actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SRL through extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning and agentic software engineering benchmarks. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms strong baselines across both domains (5.1 & 5.3). Through detailed analysis, we show that granular guidance is vital to SRLs reward and its impact on model behavior. We observe that SRL induces flexible and sophisticated reasoning patterns, such as interleaved planning and verification, which improve solution quality without simply increasing output length (5.2). 2 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning Figure 2 Illustration of SRL as compared to RL(VR) and SFT. (a) RL(VR) takes query as input and performs rollouts. The final answer correctness is used as the reward. (b) SFT uses both query and complete teacher response as input, training with per-token loss to maximize the probability 𝑝(yx). (c) SRL also uses query and teacher response. It breaks the response into step actions and, at each step, uses the previous steps as context. The model generates next step action along with its step-wise inner thoughts, and the reward 𝑟𝑘 is based on the similarity between the models and the teachers action. 2. Related Work 2.1. SFT (Distillation) for LLM Reasoning. Distilling reasoning into smaller models via SFT on teacher-generated long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales has proven highly effective for transferring complex problem-solving skills (Huang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Min et al., 2024; Yeo et al., 2025), as exemplified by the small models distilled from DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025). Research indicates this process is surprisingly data-efficient, with small, high-quality datasets often being sufficient (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025). Given the success, research has focused on the underlying factor for effective SFT distillation (Chen et al., 2025a). Some emphasized the logical structure of the reasoning trace rather than its semantic correctness (Luo et al., 2025; Stechly et al., 2025), as models can learn from demonstrations with factual errors (Li et al., 2025a). Moreover, significant challenges remain in the student-teacher gap where the student fails to learn from overly complex data (Li et al., 2025b), and the risk of teacher hacking, where the student overfits to teachers specific flaws (Tiapkin et al., 2025). Ultimately, distillation from teacher model imposes performance ceiling on the student (Huang et al., 2024). 2.2. RL for LLM Reasoning. The development of DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) showed the effectiveness of rule-based RL for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This approach utilizes scalable reward system based on final answer correctness, exemplified by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm (Shao et al., 2024) and parallel algorithms (Ahmadian et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2025). Building on this foundation, subsequent research has introduced numerous algorithmic refinements. For example, Dr. GRPO (Liu et al., 2025) mitigates bias by removing variance normalization, while DAPO (Yu et al., 2025) introduces token-level loss and relaxes the policy update constraint by increasing the clipping threshold. Other notable advancements include modifications to clipping methods, normalization techniques, the KL divergence loss, and dynamic sampling strategies (Chen et al., 2025b; Chu et al., 2025b; Zhang and Zuo, 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). Despite these algorithmic variations, these approaches primarily rely on the final outcomes reward signal. 3 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning critical challenge arises when the rollouts fail to identify correct solution trajectory, particularly for difficult queries. DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), for instance, addresses this by filtering out instructions that do not yield any successful rollouts. 3. Preliminaries Large Language Model (LLM) is formally defined by probability distribution 𝑝𝜃 over sequences of tokens, parameterized by set of model weights 𝜃. Given an input prompt, represented as token sequence = [𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛], the model generates response sequence = [ 𝑦1, . . . , 𝑦𝑚]. The response is produced autoregressively, where the generation of the token 𝑦 𝑗 at any step 𝑗 is conditioned on the initial prompt and all preceding tokens in the generated sequence, ( 𝑦1, . . . , 𝑦 𝑗1). The joint probability of the entire response sequence given the prompt is thus factorized as: 𝑝𝜃(yx) = (cid:206)𝑚 𝑝𝜃( 𝑦 𝑗x, 𝑦1, . . . , 𝑦 𝑗1). 𝑗=1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). SFT is typically employed to specialize LLM for downstream applications or domains. It is also commonly used to establish cold start for subsequent RL training phases that requires certain reply format/pattern, such as RL for reasoning (Deng et al., 2025) or tool 𝑖=1, where each x(𝑖) use (Feng et al., 2025). Specifically, the process utilizes dataset = {(x(𝑖) , (𝑖) )}𝑁 is an input prompt and (𝑖) is the corresponding desired model output. The primary objective is to update the parameters 𝜃 to maximize the conditional probability of generating the target response (𝑖) given the input prompt x(𝑖) . This goal is formally achieved by minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss function: LSFT(𝜃) = (cid:205)𝑁 𝑖=1 log 𝑝𝜃(y (𝑖) x(𝑖) ) over the entire dataset. By minimizing this loss, the model learns to produce responses that are closely aligned with the exact words demonstrated in the labeled training examples. Reinforcement Learning (RL). Recent literature on improving model reasoning capability has focused on RL with verifiable reward (RLVR), where the policy model receives reward signals purely based on the final answer correctness. Building on this principle, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) involves sampling group of 𝐺 response trajectories, {o𝑖}𝐺 𝑖=1, from the previous policy model, 𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑, for each input query x. The objective function for GRPO is: 𝐺 (cid:20) 1 𝐺 𝔼 o𝑖 min (cid:16) 𝑝𝜃(𝑜𝑖,𝑡 x, o𝑖,<𝑡) 𝑝𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖,𝑡 x, o𝑖,<𝑡) ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡, clip(cid:0) 𝑝𝜃(𝑜𝑖,𝑡 x, o𝑖,<𝑡) 𝑝𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖,𝑡 x, o𝑖,<𝑡) , 1 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖(cid:1) ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 (cid:17)(cid:21) (cid:105) . (1) 1 o𝑖 (cid:104) 𝑖=1 𝛽 𝔻KL 𝑡=1 𝑝𝜃 𝑝ref The hyperparameter 𝜖 > 0 defines the clipping range for the policy update ratio, and the coefficient 𝛽 > 0 modulates the influence of the KL-divergence penalty against the policy update. The term 𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 refers to the policy from the previous iteration. The advantage function, ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = (𝑟𝑖 mean(𝑟))/std(𝑟), is defined as the group-level normalized reward. key challenge for these RL algorithms emerges when input queries are either too easy or too hard, resulting in uniform correctness within policy rollouts {o𝑖}𝐺 𝑖=1. In such cases, the advantage estimate ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 vanishes, yielding an uninformative policy gradient and preventing model updates. common strategy to mitigate this is to dynamically sample the batches, filtering out samples and re-sampling until the data sample satisfies 0 < {o𝑖is_correct(o𝑖)} < 𝐺 (Yu et al., 2025). 4 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning 4. Methodology 4.1. The challenge of hard reasoning problem RL with verifiable outcome reward is prominent technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The strategy has been interpreted as closing the gap between models potential performance across multiple attempts (pass@𝑘) (Brown et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2025). However, this paradigm struggles on problems where the models pass@𝑘 rate is already near zero. For this set of difficult problems, which we term Dhard, positive reward signals are too sparse for RLVR to be effective (Xiong et al., 2025). Moreover, simply penalizing incorrect outputs can be detrimental to model performance (Xiong et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025), creating significant challenge for improving model reasoning. Formally, we define Dhard = {x(𝑖) , 𝑎(𝑖) }𝑁 (cid:205)𝑘 rate is low with 𝑘 samples: 1 𝑘 is sampled from the policy 𝑝𝜽(x) and 𝜖 > 0 is small constant. 𝑖=1 as the set of problems (x, 𝑎) where policy models success 𝑗=1 𝕀(cid:0)ExtractAnswer(y ( 𝑗) ) == 𝑎(cid:1) 𝜖, where each solution attempt ( 𝑗) Due to the scarcity of successful trajectories, standard RL with verifiable reward struggles on Dhard. Such data is further difficult to be learned by SFT, due to its limited amount and complexity in teacher reasoning trajectories (Li et al., 2025b). 4.2. Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL) To address the challenge of learning from Dhard, we introduce Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), framework that decomposes complex problem-solving as sequential decision-making process, and thus can be easily learned on how to properly operate step-wise. Instead of generating monolithic solution, the model learns to take actions similar to the expert while producing their own inner reasoning process in step-by-step manner. The whole framework is illustrated in Figure 3. Action-based problem formulation. Given an expert solution trajectory that leads to correct final answer, we decompose into sequence of tuples: = {ystep𝑛 }𝑁 𝑛=1. Each steps represents logical action: the concrete action to be operated. This formulation is domain-agnostic; for instance, an action in mathematical reasoning could be an algebraic manipulation, while for software agent, it could be command executed in code repository. Step-wise training data construction. To create training data for SRL, we leverage powerful teacher model, 𝜽𝑒𝑥 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡 to generate solution trajectories. From single complete solution with 𝑁 steps, we construct 𝑁 1 partial trajectories. For each step 𝑘 {1, . . . , 𝑁 1}, we create new input prompt xstep𝑘 = [x, ystep1 ], where the models task is to predict the subsequent step, ystep𝑘. This process transforms one expert solution into rich set of training instances that teach the model to proceed correctly from various intermediate states. , . . . , ystep𝑘1 Learning with sequence similarity reward with own inner monologue. Given partial context xstep𝑘 containing the problem and partial solution, the policy model 𝑝𝜽 is prompted to generate the subsequent action step with their own inner monologue think, which is encapsulated by <think> tags. We then provide dense reward based on the quality of the generated logical action step𝑘. The prediction can be formally specified as: 𝑝𝜽(xstep𝑘) = [y , ]. think step𝑘 To guide training, we consider the reward function that measures the similarity between the generated action: 𝑅(y step𝑘 , ystep𝑘) = 2𝑀 𝑇 , where 1Empirically, we found that providing the subsquent step title (e.g., 2. **Coprime Pairs** in Figure 3) as the additional context for the learner to predict the rest of the step content can further boost the performance. 5 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning Figure 3 Given solution trajectory, we take each summarized step as an action to be learned and take the partial solution before the step as the context of our newly created data. The model is then prompted to generate its thinking process followed by the action for the current step. reward (𝑟2 in the figure) is then calculated based on the similarity between the models and the experts action. (Total elements): This is the total number of elements in both sequences combined. It is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the two sequences: 𝑇 = 𝑆1 + 𝑆2. (Matched elements): The total count of elements found in all non-overlapping matching blocks between the two sequences. The algorithm first finds the longest contiguous matching subsequence and then recursively searches for more matches in the segments to the left and right of that block. If we represent the set of all such matching blocks as list of tuples (𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑛), where 𝑛 is the length of the matching block, then 𝑀 is the sum of all lengths 𝑛: 𝑀 = (cid:205) 𝑛. (𝑖, 𝑗,𝑛) MatchingBlocks Combining these definitions, we can calculate the similarity ratio 𝑅 [0, 1] as: 2 (cid:205) 𝑅 = (𝑖, 𝑗,𝑛) MatchingBlocks 𝑆1 + 𝑆2 𝑛 In practice, we use Pythons difflib.SequenceMatcher for this comparison, and assign negative reward if the generated output fails to follow the required format. Hence, the final reward used is: 𝑟(y step𝑘 , ystep𝑘) = (cid:40)𝑅(y 1 step𝑘 , ystep𝑘) if follows format, otherwise. The policy 𝑝𝜽 is then optimized using this reward signal with the GRPO objective function defined in Equation 1. Notably, our reward is computed only on the logical action, not the internal monologue. This grants the model flexibility to develop its own internal reasoning style while ensuring its external actions align with the experts strategy. This design provides dense, step-level feedback and allows for rapid reward calculation, making the SRL framework both effective and scalable. Dynamic sampling for SRL. As our reward signal 𝑟 [0, 1] {1} is dense, we generalize the dynamic sampling strategy previously designed for outcome accuracy and implement it to filter samples with less meaningful updates. Specifically, sample should be filtered out if its rollouts yield rewards with near-zero variance, providing weak advantage and thus weak learning signal. With the sequence similarity reward in SRL, we retain sample if the standard deviation of the reward 6 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning scores of its rollouts exceeds threshold 𝜖 > 0: (cid:205)𝐺 𝑖=1(𝑟(o𝑖, y) 𝑟)2 𝐺 > 𝜖 where 𝐺 is the number of generated rollouts, 𝑟(o𝑖, y) is the sequence similarity reward for the 𝑖-th rollout o𝑖 given the expert trajectory y, and 𝑟 is the mean reward for the sample. To maintain consistent batch size of 𝐵, we continuously sample and filter until the batch is filled. 5. Experiments 5.1. Main Results: Math Reasoning Setup. We finetue Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) on the s1K-1.1 dataset (Muennighoff et al., 2025). This dataset contains 1,000 diverse and challenging questions, each accompanied by detailed reasoning trace and final solution generated by DeepSeek R1. The solutions from DeepSeek R1 are formatted with structured, numbered steps (e.g., 1. Title of Step 1). We leverage this structure to generate intermediate training targets by parsing these solutions and treating each complete step as ground-truth continuation. Any data points that do not adhere to this format are excluded. We hold out 60 questions from the dataset to form our validation set. Baselines. We benchmark our proposed methods against several baselines, all initialized from the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model. These baselines include: (i) SFT on either the complete reasoning traces (R1 reasoning) or the final solutions from the s1K-1.1 dataset (R1 outline); (ii) s1K-7B, the official distilled model released by the datasets authors; and (iii) RLVR, which we implement using the GRPO algorithm. To ensure fair comparison, we implement additional dynamic sampling as in Yu et al. (2025), which removes samples with all correct or incorrect rollouts. We evaluate RLVR in two distinct settings: applied directly to the base model and applied after an initial SFT phase. Our proposed method, SRL, is likewise evaluated both as standalone technique and in sequential configuration where it precedes RLVR (SRL then RLVR). All models are trained for up to 30 epochs, and for each method, we select the checkpoint with the best performance on the validation set. Evaluation. We evaluate all models on the following four competition-level mathematical reasoning benchmarks: AMC232, AIME243, AIME254 and Minerva Math (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Our evaluation protocol for all benchmarks strictly follows the setup established by Qwen2.5-Math5 and report the accuracy of greedy sampling. In addition, for AMC23, AIME24 and AIME25, we report the average@32 score with temperature of 1.0 for all baselines to ensure more robust evaluation. Performance. The performance results of our models are summarized in Table 1. Consistent with the officially released S1K-7B model, our model trained with SFT on the same dataset exhibited notable performance degradation. In contrast, methods based on RL maintained generalization on the evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, while RLVR maintained the performance, SRL provided substantial boost of 3.0% on average. Furthermore, applying RLVR after SRL training yielded 3.7% increase on average, leveraging only 1k training data. 2https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/aimo-validation-amc 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/aimo-validation-aime 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/aime25 5https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning Table 1 Evaluation results across competition-level math benchmarks.

Analysis: Math Reasoning Effect of dynamic sampling in SRL. In Table 2, we analyze the impact of the dynamic sampling component in SRL, based on thresholding the standard deviation of sequence similarity rewards within rollouts. For both models, we train until the training reward converges and select checkpoint based on validation scores. Our results are consistent the findings of DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), which stated that removing samples that provide zero learning signal is critical in the effectiveness of the RL training loop, showing non-trivial performance improvement. Disentangling the impact of guidance granularity in SRL. To isolate the effects of guidance granularity from the benefits of sequence similarity rewards, we evaluated our multi-step method against two simplified, one-step baselines: Final-answer reward: This baseline utilizes RLVR trained with GRPO, rewarding the model solely based on the correctness of the final answer. Holistic sequence similarity reward: The model generates complete solution in single step. This entire solution is then evaluated for similarity against the complete ground-truth trajectory. As shown in Table 3, the results underscore the value of fine-grained guidance for sequence similarity reward. While the holistic sequence-similarity reward improved performance on average, providing granular, step-by-step guidance led to markedly superior performance across benchmarks. 8 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning Table 3 Model Performance of different reward functions and density. For sequence similarity reward, we implement it with the entire expert output as an one-step supervision. The model benefits from our multi-step decomposition on the small set of challenging training data.

Beyond achieving superior performance, models trained with SRL demonstrate distinctive and flexible reasoning patterns. Conventional models typically generate single, monolithic block of reasoning at the beginning of solution. In contrast, our models, particularly those fine-tuned with RLVR, dynamically interleave reasoning steps with the solutiongeneration process. This behavior manifests in three primary ways: (1) upfront planning by outlining all subsequent steps in comprehensive initial plan; (2) on-the-fly adjustments by inserting multiple, distinct reasoning blocks throughout its solution to make iterative plans and adjustments; and (3) reflective verification: the model pauses to reflect on and verify its answer before delivering the final output. The examples (Example 1 below and 2 in the Appendix), drawn from model trained with our SRLRL approach, illustrate these emergent reasoning patterns. Example 1: Interleaved thinking and self-verification Question: What is the least positive integer value of 𝑥 for which the inequality 3𝑥 > 2𝑥 + 1 is true? <think> To solve the inequality 3𝑥 > 2𝑥 + 1, we can start by isolating 𝑥. Lets subtract 2𝑥 from both sides of the inequality. </think> Subtract 2𝑥 from both sides: This simplifies to: 3𝑥 2𝑥 > 2𝑥 + 1 2𝑥 𝑥 > 1 <think> We can verify this by substituting 𝑥 = 2 into the original inequality to ensure it holds true. </think> The inequality 𝑥 > 1 tells us that 𝑥 must be greater than 1. The smallest positive integer greater than 1 is 2. Therefore, the least positive integer value of 𝑥 that satisfies the inequality is 2. Substitute 𝑥 = 2 into the original inequality: This simplifies to: 3(2) > 2(2) + 1 6 > 5 This is true, so 𝑥 = 2 is indeed solution. Therefore, the least positive integer value of 𝑥 for which the inequality 3𝑥 > 2𝑥 + 1 is true is 2 . Reasoning length. We further investigate whether the performance gains from SRL can be simply attributed to an increase in reasoning length. In Figure 4, we plot the distribution of reasoning lengths Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning (i.e., the number of words in the solution) for both the base model and our SRL-finetuned model. We observe no significant difference between the two distributions. This finding suggests that the performance improvement stems from enhanced planning and higher-quality reasoning, rather than merely an increased token budget at inference time. Figure 4 Reasoning length distribution for base model and model trained with SRL. 5.3. Extension: Software Engineering Agentic Reasoning Task. We extend our SRL framework to the domain of software engineering, training agents to resolve real-world programming issues. These tasks are commonly evaluated on benchmarks like SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2023), which requires agents to perform complex, multi-turn interactions with large codebases and reason deeply about code functionality. However, unlike in math domain, the direct application of online RL to software engineering is impeded by significant practical challenges. These include handling long context windows, highlatency environment feedback, and slow patch verification (Golubev et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025). Consequently, these obstacles have hindered the development of stable and scalable end-to-end RL methods, leading to prevailing approach of collecting expert agent trajectories and distilling them into policy via SFT (Pan et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025). Setup. We apply SRL to further fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (Hui et al., 2024), model already specialized for coding tasks. We use dataset from Yang et al. (2025), which consists of 5,000 expert agent trajectories. These trajectories were generated by claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 (Anthropic, 2025) and subsequently verified to ensure they produce correct code patches. Each trajectory is composed of multiple steps defined by the agents interactions with the coding environment. As the example below illustrates, single step contains natural language reasoning followed by an executable action: ' ll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the issue with the ` OriginValidator ` not properly handling wildcard (*) in allowed_origins . Let 's follow the steps you outlined . ## Step 1: Find and read relevant code First , let 's explore the repository structure to locate the ` OriginValidator ` class mentioned in the PR description .

Results in the table are using greedy decoding. Oracle File Edit End-to-End Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct (Base) SWE-Gym-7B SRL (ours) 5.8 8.4 14. 3.2 4.2 8.6 In line with our SRL formulation (Section 4.2), we define the action as the environment-consumable command (e.g., the bash call). Following this decomposition, we process the full trajectories to create 134k step-wise training instances. For validation, we hold out 30 full trajectories, from which we curate validation set of 650 step-wise instances. Evaluation. We evaluate our models patch generation performance by measuring its resolve rate (%) under two distinct configurations, following Wei et al. (2025): (1) Oracle file editing evaluation: The model is provided with the oracle code files to repair. This configuration isolates and measures the models core patch generation capability; (2) End-to-end evaluation: This setting uses the Agentlessmini agent scaffold (Wei et al., 2025) to first identify the file(s) to modify and subsequently generate the patch. It tests the models fault localization and code repair abilities in conjunction. We compare our SRL-trained model against two crucial baselines: the original base model (Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct) and SWE-Gym-7B (Pan et al., 2024). Since SWE-Gym-7B is an SFT-based model finetuned from the same base model, this provides direct, fair comparison between SFT and our SRL training methodology. As shown in Table 4, SRL substantially outperforms both baselines. In the oracle setting, SRL achieves 14.8% resolve rate, representing 74% relative improvement over the strong SWE-Gym-7B baseline. The performance gain is consistent when evaluating in the challenging end-to-end setting, where SRL can obtain twice the performance. 5.4. Discussion Lastly, we note that the effectiveness of SRL is fundamentally contingent on the student models initial proficiency to the task and the quality of the step-wise data and rollout samples obtained. key prerequisite is that the student model must demonstrate baseline competence in instructionfollowing. This ensures that the initial rollout samples are task-relevant and correctly structured, establishing solid foundation for learning. Furthermore, while our step-wise decomposition method reduces task complexity, the resulting data must allow the policy model to attain good rewards with certain probability. 6. Conclusion In conclusion, we introduced Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), novel method designed to teach LLMs complex reasoning skills from expert demonstrations, particularly for problems that are too difficult for conventional RL or SFT approaches. By breaking down expert solutions into manageable steps and leveraging dense sequence similarity reward, SRL provides effective, granular guidance that bridges the gap between imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Our empirical results demonstrate that SRL not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in both mathematical reasoning and software engineering tasks but also enables powerful curriculum learning strategy when combined with RLVR. This work establishes SRL as robust and generalizable technique for unlocking models potential to learn from challenging, multi-step problems, paving the way for training more capable and versatile AI agents. 11 Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning 7.

Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning A. Illustration of SRL on SWE Tasks. In Figure 5, we illustrate how we approach the SWE tasks with SRL. We take two consecutive actionobservation pairs from the expert trajectories in the given SFT data as context. We prompt the LLM to first think in monologues and then conclude with its action. Sequence similarity score is thus computed between model action and expert action in the trajectory. Figure 5 Illustration of applying SRL to SWE tasks. We take two rounds of the past expert actions and corresponding observations in context and prompt the LLM to think before reaches the next action. The model action is compared with the expert action to compute the sequence similarity reward. B. Experiment Details We use VeRL as the training framework for GRPO and implement SRL based on it. In Table 5, 6 and 7, we detail the hyperparameters that we used for SFT, GRPO and SRL. The batch size for GRPO is set to be smaller (128) than SRL (512) as the filter rate is high based on final answer correctness, for most of the questions are very difficult. We maintain smaller batch size to avoid repeated sampling and achieve better performance. We further lay out the system prompts we used for SRL. Experiments were conducted on GPU clusters to the similar level of NVIDIA H100 80GB GPU. Table 5 Supervised fine-tuning hyperparameters."

Additional Output Examples Example 2: Planning Question: Josh decides to try flipping house. He buys house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make? <think> To determine Joshs profit, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 2. Subtract the initial cost of the house and the repair costs from the new value to find the profit. </think> First, lets calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The value of the house increased by 150% after the repairs. The initial cost of the house is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The total cost before the value increase is: 80, 000 + 50, 000 = 130, 000 The value of the house increased by 150% of its initial value of $80,000. So, the increase in value is: 150% 80, 000 = 1.5 80, 000 = 120, Therefore, the new value of the house is: 80, 000 + 120, 000 = 200, 000 Now, we subtract the total cost (initial cost of the house plus the repair costs) from the new value of the house to find the profit: So, Joshs profit is: Example 3: Self-verification 200, 000 130, 000 = 70, 70000 Question: Which one of these constellations is not located along the Milky Way in the sky? Answer Choices: (A) Perseus (B) Cygnus (C) Scorpius (D) Leo First, lets recall which constellations are along the Milky Way. Perseus, Cygnus, and Scorpius are all well-known constellations that lie along the Milky Way. However, Leo is not one of them; it is located in the northern sky and does not align with the Milky Way. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Leo. <think> To double-check, can recall the general locations of these constellations: - Perseus is in the northern sky and is part of the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way. - Cygnus is also in the northern sky and is part of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. - Scorpius is in the southern sky and is part of the Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way. - Leo is in the northern sky and is not aligned with the Milky Way. </think> The answer is (D) Leo.
