            "content": "Long-term open-domain dialogue capabilities are crucial for developing engaging chatbots that can remember previous interactions and respond with empathy, both of which are key aspects of emotional intelligence (EI) (Goleman, 1998; Mayer * Authors contributed equally. Work done during internship at Snap Inc. 1https://github.com/danny911kr/REALTALK 1 Figure 1: Motivation Example. LLM-simulated dialogues often exhibit excessive empathy, even when discussing negative topics, whereas real-world human dialogues demonstrate broader emotional spectrum, incorporate reflective and grounding language, and progressively develop intimacy over time. et al., 2008). However, evaluating large language models (LLMs) in this context is challenging. key obstacle lies in collecting real-world, humanto-human conversations featuring the same individuals over extended periods, ensuring consistent personasan important factor for passing the Turing test (Turing, 2009; Vinyals and Le, 2015). To address this, recent efforts have turned to LLMs to simulate long-term dialogues between two human participants, resulting in synthetic conversation datasets (Kim et al., 2023a; Jang et al., 2023a; Zhong et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024; Maharana et al., 2024). Yet, questions remain about whether these simulated dialogues genuinely capture the nuances of real-world human interaction. In this study, we introduce REALTALK, realworld, long-term dialogue dataset featuring pairs of individuals who initially connected through messaging apps. Over 21 days, 10 participants each engaged in two separate conversations with different partners, capturing evolving communication patterns. This resulted in total of 10 unique conversations, each spanning approximately 21 sessions. These daily or near-daily interactions amounted to over 16,000 words per conversation (3). The structure of these dialogues parallels the approach used in LOCOMO (Maharana et al., 2024), where LLMs engage in extended conversations, exchanging small talk, and the occasional image. By collecting human dialogues of comparable length, REALTALK enables direct comparisons between realworld and LLM-simulated conversations. Using our data, we analyze two key aspects of real-world long-term dialogues that distinguish them from LLM-simulated conversations. First, we examine emotional intelligence (EI) by comparing authentic human conversations with LLMgenerated dialogues using dialogue-level EI assessment (4 - 5.2). Our findings show that real conversations gradually build intimacy over time (Altman, 1973; Derks et al., 2008), featuring wide emotional range, whereas LLM-simulated chats often begin at high intimacy level, predominantly maintain positive tone, and display excessive empathyeven amid negative topics (See Figure 1). Next, we explore persona consistency, investigating whether individuals maintain stable persona across multiple conversations and assessing how well models capture these shifts or continuities over time (5.3). Our analysis reveals that human conversational styles naturally fluctuate based on context, reflecting variations in emotional intelligence. In contrast, LLMsdespite being prompted with distinct personasexhibit only minimal differences, struggling to adapt and replicate nuanced persona shifts over extended interactions. Building on these insights, we introduce two benchmark tasks to evaluate model performance in long-term dialogues. (1) Persona simulation: Maintaining consistent persona is key to fostering trust, engagement, and personalization in AI interactions. This task assesses how well an LLM can simulate an individuals unique persona by continuing conversation dialogue given prior context. We evaluate the models ability to reproduce users next message and match their EI attributes (6.1); (2) Memory probing: Long-term memory is essential for AI to sustain coherent, contextaware conversations. This benchmark tests whether models can retain and apply long-term context by answering 728 human-annotated memory probing questions linked to the conversation (6.2). Our experimental results show that models struggle to simulate user solely from dialogue history. However, fine-tuning on specific users chat history improves persona emulation. Additionally, existing models still face significant challenges in recalling and effectively leveraging long-term context in real-world conversations. To summarize, we introduce REALTALK, largescale, real-world dialogue dataset capturing 21 days of authentic, evolving conversations. Our analysis uncovers key differences in EI and persona consistency, showing that LLMs struggle to replicate human adaptability. To bridge this gap, we introduce two benchmarkspersona simulation and memory probingto drive the development of more human-like, memory-aware AI."

Recent studies in longterm dialogue aim to improve model coherence and empathy through better memory recall of past interactions (See Table 1 for more details). Early work focused on collecting human-human dialogues from online sources (e.g., Reddit) or via crowd-sourcing to evaluate model in multi-session, open-domain conversations (Xu et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2023; Li et al., 2017), and collecting human-AI dialogues to analyze user interactions and align models with user expectations (Zheng et al., 2023; KÃ¶pf et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024b). With LLMs now capable of processing longer contexts, recent studies simulate extensive human-human dialogues (Kim et al., 2023a; Jang et al., 2023b; Maharana et al., 2024) and human-AI dialogues (Zhong et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024) to improve model evaluation, addressing the difficulty of obtaining naturally long conversations.

Human-AI dialogues primarily address taskoriented interactions where humans aim to achieve specific goals through the dialogue.

Unlike other works that simulate dialogues using models, REALTALK is entirely derived from real-world human interactions. memory recalling capability of LLMs within realworld long-term human-human dialogues, where informal cues may often challenge retention. Emotional Intelligence. Prior research on emotional intelligence before the emergence of large language models (LLMs) primarily focused on affective understanding, where models were trained to recognize and interpret human emotions and sentiments based on text and its surrounding context (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004; Hutto and Gilbert, 2014; Rosenthal et al., 2017; Mohammad et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020; Antypas et al., 2023) With the advent of LLMs, researchers have adapted or fine-tuned these models for affective tasks, such as predicting emotion intensity and classifying emotions in human text (Lei et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, LLMs have been evaluated for their ability to infer how individuals might feel in specific scenarios (Wang et al., 2023; Paech, 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024a). However, existing studies remain limited to sentiment and emotion analysis at the message or context level, without assessing the overall emotional intelligence of specific speaker across extended conversations. In contrast, our work investigates long-term, realworld human dialogues, analyzing both genuine human interactions and LLM-simulated conversations through comprehensive taxonomy of EI attributes. Beyond sentiment and emotion, we examine factors such as empathy, grounding acts, reflectiveness, and intimacy. Additionally, we use these EI attributes as metrics to evaluate how effectively model simulates specific persona over time."

Each session should feel like conversation between friends, with participants sharing opinions and experiences. Moreover, we encouraged participants to thoughtfully integrate images into the conversation, sourcing them from the internet under Creative Commons license and avoiding explicit descriptions of the image content.

G(M) is boolean indicator that captures whether speaker use actssuch as clarifying questions or follow-upswhich are essential for building common ground and preventing misunderstandings (Clark, 1996; Clark and Schaefer, 1989; Shaikh et al., 2024). We use an LLMbased classification to label each turn as grounding or not (see Appendix C.2). Emotion & Sentiment & Intimacy. E(M) and S(M) represent the speakers emotion and sentiment labels in message M, respectively. Emotion is classified into 11 predefined categories (e.g., anger, fear, joy), while sentiment is classified into 3 categories (positive, negative, neutral). I(M) is floating-point value that indicates the speakers level of intimacy in the message M. Each of these attributes is measured using models trained specifically for emotion, sentiment, and intimacy classification, leveraging an annotated dataset from Twitter (Antypas et al., 2023). While LLMs could be used for these tasks, fine-tuned models perform comparably or slightly better while being significantly more cost-efficient, making them more 4 practical choice for large-scale evaluation (Rathje et al., 2024).

Self-awareness. It reflects speakers ability to recognize and articulate emotions and perspectives. It is measured using two metrics: (1) Reflective frequency measures how often speaker engages in self-reflection: reflective_frequency(s) = (cid:80) MMs R(M) Ms where Ms is the set of messages by speaker s. (2) Emotion & Sentiment Diversity captures the range of emotions or sentiments expressed by speaker s, calculated using entropy. Let represent the predefined sentiment labels (i.e., positive, negative, neutral), and ps(x) denote the proportion of label in the speakers messages Ms: (cid:80) MMs ps(x) = 1(S(M) = x) Ms , where 1(S(M) = x) equals 1 if the sentiment label of message is x, and 0 otherwise. Using this, sentiment diversity is computed as: sentiment_diversity(s) = (cid:88) xL ps(x)log2 ps(x). The same applies to emotion_diversity by substituting S(M) with E(M) and using emotion labels. Motivation speakers engagement in maintaining the conversation, measured by grounding frequency, the proportion of messages containing grounding acts: grounding_frequency(s) = (cid:80) MMs G(M) Ms Social Skills speakers ability to foster trust and engagement, measured via intimacy progression, assuming intimacy naturally evolves over time.

Participants share 2346 images per pair and revisit topics 68 times, showcasing sustained and rich interactions. Detailed statistics are provided in Appendix A.2. Three key characteristics distinguish real-world human dialogues from LLM-generated dialogues: First, Human dialogues are inherently noisy, featuring typos, abbreviations, acronyms, and slang (e.g., imo for in my opinion and dunno for dont know), reflecting the informal and natural flow of communication. Second, human conversations exhibit noticeable gaps between messages unlike LLM-generated dialogues, reflecting asynchronous and flexible communication. On average, participants take 20.98 minutes to respond, with median gap of 2.22 minutes. Some gaps extend up to 27.90 hours, highlighting the non-linear nature of real-world interactions (Appendix A.4). Third, human dialogues often include varying lengths of consecutive messages (i.e., chat bubbles) by the same speaker, reflecting diverse communication patterns. On average, participants send 2.31 consecutive messages per turn, with median of 2.00 and maximum of 68, showcasing occasional extended monologues (Appendix A.5). We evaluate speaker-level EI (4.3) in real-world and LLM-generated dialogues using the LOCOMO dataset (Maharana et al., 2024). Speaker-level EI is derived from message-level EI: reflectiveness, grounding acts, and empathy are computed using gpt-4o-mini, while sentiment, emotion, and intimacy are classified using task-specific finetuned RoBERTa models trained on labeled Twitter data (Antypas et al., 2023). Each speaker in each conversation receives an independent EI score. Figure 2 illustrates key differences between human (REALTALK) and LLM-generated (LOCOMO) dialogues by showing the distribution of speaker EI scores (full comparison in Appendix E.1): (1) Humans exhibit greater emotion and sentiment diversity, while LLMs remain constrained; (2) LLMs display excessive empathy; and (3) Humans show high variance in EI attributes, whereas LLMs are more uniform, aligning with prior research (Lee et al., 2024). High emotional intelligencecharacterized by strong grounding, emotional alignment, and intimacy progressionenhances engagement and relationship-building (Altman, 1973; Hatfield et al., 1993; Derks et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2017; Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002). However, since human EI naturally varies across individuals and interactions, enforcing uniformly high EI in LLMs does not make them more human-like. Instead, tailoring LLMs to specific individuals better reflects the diverse dynamics of real human interactions."

We explore whether finetuning improves an LLMs ability to simulate speakers responses given conversational context. potential approach is to train on all Ca conversations and evaluate on Cb. However, this risks data leakage, as speaker in Ca may appear in Cb. To ensure fairness, we train and test each speaker separately. First, we train models using different amounts of conversation history as context and test them with the same number of sessions used in training. However, we observe no clear pattern indicating that increasing the amount of conversational context improves performance (See Appendix E.3).

LLMs struggle with longterm memory even with full conversation (C). While full context improves performance, models achieve only moderate accuracy, highlighting their limitations in applying long-term information. Event-based memory. Event-based memory (E) enhances efficiency but severely weakens memory probing performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning by causing 41-46% performance drop. By condensing conversations into key points, it 2OpenAI Memory FAQ, OpenAI Memory and Controls often removes intermediary steps crucial for linking past and present context. Unlike temporal or commonsense reasoning, multi-hop tasks require reconstructing implicit connections, which eventbased memory fails to retain. This tradeoff mirrors real-world AI memory challenges, such as memory system in LLM APIs, which stores key facts but may lose essential context for multi-turn reasoning."

Through detailed analysis, we highlight key differences between human conversations and LLM-simulated dialogues, revealing that LLMs exhibit limited emotion diversity, excessive empathy, and reduced variability in EI expression compared to real interactions. Using this data, we present two benchmarks: (1) Persona simulation, evaluating LLMs ability to replicate an individuals conversational style and showing that simple fine-tuning improves simulation accuracy. (2) Memory probing, assessing LLMs limitations in applying real-world longterm context and highlighting challenges in existing memory systems. Our findings underscore the complexity of modeling real-world persona dynamics and memory, emphasizing the need for further research. We hope REALTALK inspires advancements in socially intelligent AI, personalized dialogue systems, and adaptive memory strategies, driving more human-like interaction modeling."

            "title": "8 Limitations",
            "content": "Our study has several limitations: Demographic constraints. Participants are English speakers from the US, aged 18-25, limiting the datasets representativeness across diverse demographics. Additionally, we do not analyze how conversational dynamics vary based on factors such as gender, profession, geographic location, or age differences. Future studies should include more diverse demographic range to better understand how factors like age, gender, and cultural background influence dialogue patterns. Chit-chat focus. Our dataset primarily consists of casual, open-domain conversations rather than goal-oriented interactions. This limits its applicability to domains where social intelligence involves structured reasoning, such as negotiations or counseling (Zhou et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b). Future work should extend EI modeling to structured dialogues where speakers need to achieve their social goals. Emotional intelligence (EI) measurement. Our EI evaluation focuses on surface-level indicators, such as sentiment, reflectiveness, and empathy. However, these metrics may not fully capture deeper cognitive, cultural, and situational influences on emotional intelligence. Additionally, EI attributes are inherently subjective and challenging to quantify. To ensure reliability, we ground our evaluations in established literature. Lack of multi-modal analysis. While our dataset includes images, our experiments focus solely on text-based interactions. We do not analyze how visual elements contribute to emotional alignment, persona perception, or memory retention. Future research could integrate multi-modal fusion techniques to enhance emotional intelligence modeling."

            "content": "First-Time Interaction. You are interacting with the other speaker for the first time. Chit-chat. Engage in chit-chat that can include real events from your own life (e.g., taking nap or cooking something). The content can be fictional. Personal Information. Make the conversation personal from time to time by discussing topics like family, friends, likes, dislikes, and aspirations. The content can be fictional. Time References. Include references to time (e.g., last Friday, next month, when was ten years old) and specific places or locations. Consider the current time during the conversation; for example, if its after lunch, ask what the other participant had for lunch, or greet them with Good Morning if chatting in the morning. Dialog Style. Keep the dialogue style casual, as if talking to friend. Daily Events and News. Discuss events from your life, news, social media highlights, or pop culture events (e.g., movies, concerts). Feel free to share opinions in friendly, engaging way that may interest the other participant. Images. Share images at appropriate points in the conversation. Examples include: things you own (clothes, food, vehicles, etc.), things youve seen or want to see (e.g., food, people, events), things you like (e.g., piece of clothing, cute animal), things you need help with (e.g., how to fix something or navigate relationship), images representing old memories. Image Source. Do not share images from your camera. Instead, search for images on the internet using Google, save the image URL, and include it in square brackets within the conversation. [URL of the image] Images should be licensed under Creative Commons to allow free use by others. In Google Search, such images can be found by selecting the Creative Commons license under Tools Usage Rights. Using the dimension constraint imagesize:3024x4032 in the query yields less generic images that can foster engaging conversations. Images Containing Faces. Avoid sharing images where persons face is clearly visible and implies that it is you. However, you may share images where the face is obscured or clearly not you. Ensure any appearance remains approximately consistent throughout sessions. Image Context. Avoid sharing images that dont add information to the conversation. For example, avoid generic images that lack context or relevance, but do share images that add context, like one showing user kayaking. Pronoun Use. Refer to previously mentioned subjects in the conversation with pronouns, allowing the other participant to easily infer the reference. B.2 Question & Event Annotation Guidelines Question & Event Annotation Guidelines Introduction. These guidelines provide instructions for annotating dataset consisting of long-term conversations (approximately 21 days) between two individuals. The annotation task is divided into two sub-tasks: Events Annotation: Annotators document significant life events for each speaker in each session. Question and Answer Creation: Annotators generate questions that can only be answered by reading through one or more sessions of conversations. The dataset includes both textual and image-based conversations. Data Format. The conversation dataset consists of multiple interaction sessions between two speakers. Each session is timestamped. 14 Conversations are structured in table format with dedicated columns for each speaker. Speaker names appear at the top of the table. If speaker shares an image, it is included in the dataset. Sub-Task 1: Writing Speaker Events. Annotators document key life events for each speaker as the conversation progresses. These events may include: Past events, ongoing events, and planned future events. Small-scale events (e.g., attending cooking class) and major events (e.g., moving to new city). Annotation Format: Each event should be recorded in separate line within the allotted cell. Sub-Task 2: Creating Questions and Answers. Annotators generate questions that can only be answered by reviewing the conversation dataset. Question Categories and Examples: Questions that Require Aggregation of Information. Question: Which countries has Joseph travelled to? Answer: France, Japan Evidence: D4:1, D1:8 Category: Questions that Require Reasoning About Time. Question: When did Kate start skiing? Answer: 2013 Evidence: D1:49 Category: 2 Questions that Require Commonsense Reasoning or World Knowledge. Question: What kind of jobs might Joseph consider based on his recent ventures? Answer: Jobs that combine software engineering and management, e.g., software product manager Evidence: D2:9, D3:1 Category: 3 How to Annotate Questions: Each question entry includes the following fields: Question: The formulated question. Answer: The exact response extracted from the conversation. Evidence: Unique identifiers of dialogues used to derive the answer. Category: label (1-3) indicating the question type. Annotators should write at least 2 and up to 10 questions from any of the categories at the end of each session. Message-level EI Attributes In this section, we provide prompt details for reflectiveness, grounding act, and empathy. Also, we present model details for emotion, sentiment, and intimacy.

Component 2: Interpretation Does the response communicate an understanding of the seekers experiences and feelings? In what manner? 0: No. 1: Yes, the response communicates an understanding of the seekers experiences and/or feelings. The response contains conjectures or speculations about the seekers experiences and/or feelings. The responder reflects back on similar experiences of their own or others. The responder describes similar experiences of their own or others. The response paraphrases the seekers experiences and/or feelings. 2: The response provides deep, explicit understanding and validation of the seekers feelings or experiences, potentially using multiple sub-categories.

Each bar represents the distribution of EI attributes across individual speakers in the dataset. E.2 Full Performance of Persona Simulation Table 8 provides the complete results for content similarity and message-level EI comparison in persona simulation across all speakers, with and without fine-tuning. Table 2 is derived by averaging these values. Persona consistency in the table is measured as the absolute difference between speakers average EI across two different conversations. This approximates the impact of persona consistency on simulation performance. Results indicate that simulation performance improves when the difference is small, suggesting that speakers with more consistent personas across conversations are easier to simulate. E.3 Context Experiments for Persona Simulation Impact of conversational context. We analyze how performance changes with varying amounts of provided context. Figure 7 (left) shows that increasing conversation history does not improve messagelevel EI or exhibit clear pattern. These findings suggest that LLMs struggle to capture and replicate speakers style using context alone. Impact of fine-tuning. We examine whether fine-tuning enhances an LLMs ability to simulate speakers responses given conversational context. Models are trained using different amounts of conversation history and tested with the same number of sessions used in training. Figure 7 (right) shows that fine-tuning improves performance compared to the non-finetuned model. However, there is no clear trend indicating that increasing context length leads to further improvements.
