Introduction Motion is the defining element of videos. Unlike image generation, which produces single frame, video generative models capture how objects move, interact, and obey physical constraints [Wiedemer et al., 2025, Kang et al., 2024]. Yet even with the rapid progress of video generative models, fundamental question remains: Which training clips influence the motion in generated videos? Why it matters. Diffusion models are data-driven, and their progress has tracked the scaling of data and compute [Saharia et al., 2022, Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021, Ho et al., 2022, Peebles and Xie, 2023]. Prior work [Blattmann et al., 2023, Kaplan et al., 2020, Ravishankar et al., 2025] shows that training data shapes key generative properties, including visual quality [Rombach et al., 2022], semantic fidelity [Namekata et al., 2024], and compositionality [Wu et al., 2025, Favero et al., 2025]. Motion is no exception. Motion refers to temporal dynamics captured by optical flow, including trajectories, deformations, camera movement, and interactions. If generated motion reflects the data distribution that shaped the model, then attributing motion to influential training clips provides direct lens on why model moves the way it does and enables targeted data selection for desired dynamics. High-quality data often matters most in fine-tuning, where large pretraining corpora are inaccessible and carefully selected clips can have an outsized impact. Motion-specific attribution is therefore especially valuable in the fine-tuning regime, where the goal is to identify which clips most influence temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Why existing methods are limited for motion. Prior diffusion data attribution focuses on images and explains static content. Extending these methods to videos naïvely collapses motion into appearance, missing the temporal structure that distinguishes videos from images. Three challenges drive this gap: (i) localizing motion so attribution focuses on dynamic regions rather than static backgrounds, (ii) scaling to sequences since gradients must integrate across time, and (iii) capturing temporal relations like velocity, acceleration, and trajectory coherence that single-frame attribution cannot measure. Addressing motion attribution requires methods that explicitly model temporal structure, rather than treating time as an additional spatial axis. 2026 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. Motion Attribution for Video Generation Our method. We introduce Motive, motion attribution framework for video generation models that isolates motion-specific influence. Motive computes gradients with motion-aware masking. As result, the attribution signal emphasizes dynamic regions rather than static appearance. Efficient approximations make the method practical for large, high-quality datasets and video generative models. Our scores trace generated motion back to training clips, enabling target curation and improving motion quality when used to guide fine-tuning. Our contributions are: 1. Proposing scalable gradient-based attribution approach for video generation models that is computationally efficient, even at the scale of modern, high-quality data and large generative models (3.2). 2. Addressing video-specific bias by correcting frame-length effects in gradient magnitudes, ensuring fair attribution across clips of different durations (3.3). 3. Introducing an attribution that emphasizes temporal dynamics to trace which training clips most strongly influence motion quality (3.4). 4. Showing that we improve motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench and in human evaluation (4), matching, or surpassing, full-dataset fine-tuning performance with only 10% of the data, and outperforming motion-unaware attribution baselines (Tables 1 and 2). 2. Background We provide notation in App. and extended related work in App. B. 2.1. Video Generation with Diffusion and Flow-Matching Models Diffusion and flow matching in latent space. Let 𝑝𝜃(v c) be conditional generator with parameters 𝜃, where R𝐹 𝐻𝑊 3 is clip of height 𝐻, width 𝑊 , and 𝐹 frames, and denotes conditioning such as text or other multimodal metadata (e.g., fps, depth, pose). We operate in VAE latents: = 𝐸(v) and train denoiser or velocity field on noisy latents. noise scheduler supplies time-dependent coefficients (𝛼𝑡, 𝜎𝑡) controlling signal and noise scales, and the forward noising is: z(𝑡, 𝜖) = 𝛼𝑡 + 𝜎𝑡 𝜖, 𝜖 𝒩 (0, I), 𝑡 {1, . . . , 𝑇 }. Denoising diffusion [Ho et al., 2020] trains network 𝜖𝜃(z, c, 𝑡) to predict the injected noise: ℒdiff(𝜃; v, c) = E𝑡,𝜖 [ 𝜖𝜃(z(𝑡, 𝜖), c, 𝑡) 𝜖2 2 ] . (1) (2) Flow matching [Lipman et al., 2022, Albergo et al., 2023] learns time-dependent vector field f𝜃(z𝑡, c, 𝑡) that matches the instantaneous velocity = d𝑡 induced by chosen interpolant: f𝜃(z(𝑡, 𝜖), c, 𝑡) z(𝑡, 𝜖)2 2 [ ℒflow(𝜃; v, c) = E𝑡,𝜖 ] . (3) Both objectives train time-indexed predictors over the latent space by integrating over 𝑡 and 𝜖, thus gradientbased methods like attribution share similar challenges. From images to video for generation. Adding temporal axis materially changes modeling and training. Generation must capture spatial appearance and temporal dynamics such as object and camera motion, deformations, and interactions. Modern systems extend image backbones with temporal capacity, for example, 3D U-Nets or 2D U-Nets augmented with temporal attention, causal or sliding-window context, and factorized space-time blocks, often trained in latent-video VAE that compresses frames while preserving temporal cues. Training departs from images along several axes, which we address in 3: (i) Compute and storage. Longer sequences multiply the cost of sampling timesteps, noise draws, and frames, motivating fixed-timestep or small-subset estimators that reduce variance without prohibitive cost (3.2). (ii) Variable horizon. Clips vary in 𝐹 and frame rate (3.3). (iii) Time-specific failure modes. Typical artifacts include inconsistent trajectories, temporal flicker, identity drift, and physically implausible dynamics despite sharp individual frames (3.4). 2 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Motion representations in videos. We denote our video as = [f𝑓 ]𝐹 with f𝑓 R𝐻𝑊 3 being the 𝑓 -th frame. We represent motion via optical flow between consecutive frames: F𝑓 : {1, . . . , 𝐻} {1, . . . , 𝑊 } R2, where each flow vector in R2 encodes the horizontal displacement d𝑤 and vertical displacement dℎ of pixel. The motion magnitude is 𝑀𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) = F𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤)2. The 𝑀𝑓 over frames 𝑓 and pixels ℎ, 𝑤 summarizes the amount and spatial layout of motion in clip, which we use to provide masks in our motion-weighted loss in 3. 𝑓 =1 2.2. Data Attribution Data attribution measures how individual training samples affect models predictions [Bae et al., 2024]. classic approach to data attribution is to use influence functions [Koh and Liang, 2017]. Intuitively, the influence of training sample measures: if we upweight this training example, how much would the models prediction on test datum change? Consider loss function ℒ(𝜃; x) and test sample xtest, the influence of training point x𝑛 can be quantified as: 𝐼(x𝑛, xtest) = 𝜃ℒ(𝜃; xtest) 𝜃 𝜃ℒ(𝜃; x𝑛), H𝜃 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑛=1 2 𝜃ℒ(𝜃; x𝑛), (4) where the inverse Hessian captures the curvature of the loss landscape, yet computing or storing it is infeasible at modern model and dataset scales. Thus, practical methods (e.g., TracIn [Pruthi et al., 2020] and TRAK [Park et al., 2023]) approximate influence via gradient inner products or gradient feature projections. Attribution in diffusion models. Diffusion training aggregates gradients over timesteps 𝑡 and noise draws 𝜖, where gradient norms vary systematically with 𝑡, producing timestep bias where examples aligned with large-norm timesteps appear spuriously influential. Diffusion-ReTrac [Xie et al., 2024] reduces this bias by normalizing gradients and sub-sampling 𝑡 and 𝜖 for influence. Let ℒdiff denote the diffusion loss, and with the sampled-timestep-and-noise set 𝒯 , we compute cosine-style score for normalized test and train gradients: 𝐼diff(x𝑛, xtest) = 1 𝒯test 𝑡,𝜖𝒯test 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; xtest, 𝑡, 𝜖) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; xtest, 𝑡, 𝜖) 1 𝒯𝑛 𝑡,𝜖𝒯𝑛 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; x𝑛, 𝑡, 𝜖) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; x𝑛, 𝑡, 𝜖) . (5) normalized test gradients normalized training gradients Averaging gradients over (𝑡, 𝜖) stabilizes estimates, and normalization mitigates timestep-induced scale effects. Attribution quality is also sensitive to the measurement function used to score examples, such as denoising loss versus likelihood proxies [Zheng et al., 2023]. Why vanilla attribution is insufficient for videos. Naïvely applying gradient-based attribution to video diffusion risks treating appearance and motion alike, often overemphasizing low-level appearance matches (objects, textures, backgrounds) while overlooking dynamics [Park et al., 2025, Tulyakov et al., 2018]. Its cost grows with clip length, sampled timesteps, noise draws, and gradient dimensionality, making naïve methods impractical at modern video scales. Because we aim to explain and improve motion, we need attribution that suppresses static appearance, emphasizes motion-specific signals, and remains efficient, motivating the motion-centric approach in 3. Motion is distributed across frames and temporal horizons and entangled with static cues, so influence cannot be assigned by considering frames independently. 3. Method We formalize the problem setup in 3.1 and develop practical framework for motion attribution in video diffusion models with four key components: scalable gradient computation (3.2), frame-length bias fix (3.3), motion-aware weighting (3.4), and data selection for targeted fine-tuning (3.5). We also provide computational efficiency analysis (3.6) demonstrating the scalability of our approach to billion-parameter models and large-scale video datasets. 3 Motion Attribution for Video Generation 3.1. Problem Formulation We study data attribution for motion in the fine-tuning setting. Let 𝒟ft = {(v𝑛, c𝑛)}𝑁 be the fine-tuning corpus. Given query video (ˆv, ˆc), we assign to each training clip (v𝑛, c𝑛) motion-aware influence score 𝐼(v𝑛, ˆv; 𝜃) that explains how it contributes to the dynamics observed in ˆv. The score should satisfy: (i) predictivity, rankings correlate with observed changes from fine-tuning on the most influential subsets; (ii) efficiency, scales to modern video generators, such as forgoing explicit Hessian inversion, expensive per-data integration, or prohibitive storage. To do this, we augment the influence target defined in Eq. 5 to be (a) lower variance for stable rankings with feasible levels of compute, (b) more scalable to store, and (c) motion-centric. 𝑛=1 Fine-tuning Subset Selection. For budget 𝐾 𝑁 , we get motion-influential subset by ranking scores and taking the top-𝐾 examples. When aggregating across multiple query motions, we combine selections as described in 3. The resulting subsets serve as candidates for motion-centric fine-tuning. 3.2. Scalable Gradient-based Attribution for Generative Models We make attribution practical for modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models via inverse-Hessian approximations, lower-variance gradient-similarity estimators, low-cost single-sample estimators, and Fastfood projection for tractable storage. Approximating the inverse-Hessian. Computing exact inverse-Hessian-vector products is infeasible for modern neural networks. We estimate influence via gradient similarity, using an identity preconditioner for the inverse Hessian [Koh and Liang, 2017, Pruthi et al., 2020, Park et al., 2023]. Common randomness for stable rankings. To reduce variance without changing the target, we evaluate train and test gradients under the same (𝑡, 𝜖) pairs and average over small set 𝒯 [Xie et al., 2024, Lin et al., 2024]. This paired averaging stabilizes rankings compared to independent draws: 𝐼 1 diff(x𝑛, xtest) = 1 𝒯 𝑡,𝜖𝒯 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; xtest, 𝑡, 𝜖) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; xtest, 𝑡, 𝜖) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; x𝑛, 𝑡, 𝜖) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; x𝑛, 𝑡, 𝜖) . normalized test gradients normalized training gradients (6) Single-sample variant for reduced compute. We fix single 𝑡fix and shared draw 𝜖fix 𝒩 (0, I) for all traintest pairs at the final checkpoint. Sharing (𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) allows low enough variance for the low-cost singlesample estimator to maintain relative ordering [Xie et al., 2024, Lin et al., 2024]. The estimator collapses to: 𝐼 2 diff(x𝑛, xtest) = 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; xtest, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; xtest, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; x𝑛, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; x𝑛, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) . (7) normalized test gradient normalized training gradient Structured projection for reduced storage. To operate at model scale, we apply JohnsonLindenstrauss projection via Fastfood [Le et al., 2014] and then normalize. Let R𝐷𝐷 be implemented as := SQGΠQB, (8) 1 𝐷 𝜉 where is the WalshHadamard matrix, is diagonal Rademacher matrix, Π is random permutation, is diagonal Gaussian scaling, and is diagonal rescaling, and 𝜉 normalizes the variance. The projected, normalized gradient is: Then the influence score is the compact cosine in R𝐷: g(𝜃, x) := 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃, x, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃, x, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) . diff(x𝑛, xtest) = g(𝜃; xtest 𝐼 3 ) g(𝜃; x𝑛 ) . projected, normalized test gradient projected, normalized training gradient (9) (10) This keeps compute 𝒪(𝐷 log 𝐷) for projection and 𝒪(𝐷) per dot product, with storage 𝒪(𝒟 𝐷), while staying close to the ranking behavior of full-gradient cosine similarity [Park et al., 2023]. 4 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Figure 1: Motive. Top. Motion-gradient computation (3.4) has three steps: (1) detect motion with AllTracker; (2) compute motion-magnitude patches; (3) apply loss-space motion masks to focus gradients on dynamic regions. Bottom. Our method (3.2) is made scalable via single-sample variant with common randomness and projection, computed for each pair of training and query data, aggregated (3.5) for final ranking, and eventually used to select fine-tuning subsets. 3.3. Video-specific Frame-length Bias Fix Raw gradient magnitudes depend on the number of frames 𝐹 in the video v, thereby biasing scores toward longer videos. We correct this by normalizing for frame count before the projectionnormalization step: 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; v, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) 1 𝐹 𝜃ℒdiff(𝜃; v, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix). (11) We still apply ℓ2 normalization in Eq. 10, further stabilizing scales across examples. Together, single-timestep, common randomness, projection, and frame-length correction form compact, scalable estimator that we use throughout. However, naïve video-level attribution conflates appearance with motion, often ranking clips high just because they share backgrounds or objects, while offering little insight into dynamics. 3.4. Motion Attribution To move beyond whole-video influence, we introduce motion attribution, which isolates the contribution of training data to temporal dynamics. Unlike video-level attribution, which treats each clip as single unit and conflates appearance with motion, motion attribution reweights per-location gradients using motion masks, assigning influence via dynamic behavior rather than static content. Motion Masking Attribution. Motion is what distinguishes video diffusion from image diffusion. Our goal is to understand how training data shapes motion in video diffusion models. Prior work has emphasized architectural or algorithmic changes for motion modeling [Peebles and Xie, 2023, Blattmann et al., 2023, Guo et al., 2023], many of the largest generative gains have instead come from scaling and curating massive video corpora, which in turn enable impressive motion synthesis results in video diffusion models [Ho et al., 2022, Wan et al., 2025, Tan et al., 2024, Yang et al., 2024]. Yet we lack tools that quantify how specific training clips shape particular motion patterns. We address this by attributing motion back to data via motion-weighted gradients, which yields actionable signals for targeted data selection, artifact diagnosis, and selective fine-tuning. Motion Attribution for Video Generation Motion Detection and Latent Space Mapping. Given video R𝐹 𝐻𝑊 3 with 𝐹 frames of resolution 𝐻 𝑊 , we first encode it into the VAE latent space as = 𝐸(v) R𝐹 𝐻/𝑠𝑊/𝑠𝐶, with downsampling factor 𝑠 = 8 and 𝐶 = 16 following the Wan2.1 backbone used in our experiments. For motion computation, we use AllTracker [Harley et al., 2025] to extract motion information in pixel space: 𝐴 = 𝒜(v) R𝐹 𝐻𝑊 4, where the first two channels contain optical flow maps 𝐴:,:,:,0:2 indicating pixel displacement between frames, and the remaining channels 𝐴:,:,:,2:4 encode visibility and confidence scores. We extract displacement vectors at each pixel location as: We then bilinearly downsample motion quantities from (𝐻, 𝑊 ) to the latent grid ( 𝐻 lives where gradients are computed. 𝑠 , 𝑊 𝑠 D𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) = (𝐴𝑓,ℎ,𝑤,0, 𝐴𝑓,ℎ,𝑤,1) = (d𝑤, dℎ). (12) ) so that our masking Motion-Weighted Gradient Computation. We define the motion magnitude at each location as: 𝑀𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) = D𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤)2. To obtain comparable motion weights across frames and pixels, we minmax normalize over all frames and pixels, ensuring values lie in [0, 1]: W(𝑓, ℎ, 𝑤) = 𝑀𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) min𝑓 ,ℎ,𝑤 𝑀𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) max𝑓 ,ℎ,𝑤 𝑀𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) min𝑓 ,ℎ,𝑤 𝑀𝑓 (ℎ, 𝑤) + 𝜁 , (13) where 𝜁 = 106 ensures positive denominator. This normalization mitigates bias from absolute motion scale, yielding weights that emphasize relative motion saliency rather than raw magnitude, following prior practice in video saliency detection [Fang et al., 2013]. Let (ℎ, 𝑤) index the latent grid. We obtain latent-aligned weights by bilinear downsampling: W(𝑓, ℎ, 𝑤) = Bilinear(W(, , ), 𝐹, 𝐻 𝑠 , 𝑊 𝑠 ) . We compute per-location squared error at fixed (𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) at each frame 𝑓 and latent pixel (ℎ, 𝑤): ℒ𝜃,v,c(𝑓, ℎ, 𝑤) = ( [𝜖𝜃(z(v, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix), 𝑡fix, c)]𝑓,ℎ, 𝑤 [𝜖target(𝑡fix, 𝜖fix)]𝑓,ℎ, 𝑤 ) , and define the motion-weighted loss by averaging over frames and latent spatial locations: ℒmot(𝜃; v, c) = mean𝑓,ℎ, 𝑤 ] [ Wv,c(𝑓, ℎ, 𝑤) ℒ𝜃,v,c(𝑓, ℎ, 𝑤) . 1 𝐹v (14) (15) (16) Notably, when is all ones, this recovers the standard objective with no motion emphasis. The 1/𝐹v factor corrects for frame-length bias and 𝐹v signifies how the number of frames may be video-dependent. The corresponding motion-weighted gradient for attribution is: 𝐼mot(v𝑛,ˆv) = gmot(𝜃,ˆv)gmot(𝜃,v𝑛), where gmot(𝜃,v) := Pgmot(𝜃,v,𝑡fix,𝜖fix) Pgmot(𝜃,v,𝑡fix,𝜖fix) and gmot := 𝜃ℒmot. (17) Loss-space masking leaves forward noising and generation unchanged and reweights only attribution, avoiding interactions between motion weighting and noise injection. In contrast, our motion-aware attribution emphasizes dynamic regions and de-emphasizes static backgrounds, so rankings identify training clips that most strongly shape the models motion rather than appearance. 3.5. Most Influential Fine-tuning Subset Selection Goal. Given query clip (ˆv, ˆc), we compute motion-aware attribution value for each candidate fine-tuning example (v𝑛, c𝑛) 𝒟ft using: 𝐼mot(v𝑛, ˆv) from Eq. 17. Then, we construct fine-tuning dataset 𝒮 for one or many query videos ˆv. Single-query-point fine-tuning selection. For budget of 𝐾 data points, we select the 𝐾 highest-scoring examples. In practice, 𝐾 is chosen as percentile of the dataset size (e.g., top 110%), ensuring the subset scales consistently across datasets. 6 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Multi-query-point fine-tuning selection: aggregating attribution scores. For 𝑄 queries, we adopt the majority voting approach from ICONS [Wu et al., 2024] and aggregate motion-aware influence scores across queries by percentile thresholding and voting. sample receives vote if the score is above the percentile cutoff 𝜏 for that query. The consensus score of candidate v𝑛 is the total number of queries that vote for it. We then rank all training samples by MajVote(v𝑛) and select the top-𝐾 to form the fine-tuning subset. This formulation emphasizes samples that are consistently influential across multiple queries, without requiring cross-query calibration of raw scores: MajVote𝑛 = 𝑄 𝑞= I[ 𝐼mot(v𝑛, ˆv𝑞) > 𝜏 ], 𝒮vote(𝐾) = {v𝑛v𝑛 in top-𝐾 by MajVote}. (18) 3.6. Computational Efficiency Analysis Gradient Compute. Naïvely averaging over timesteps and noise for every example costs 𝒪(𝒟 𝒯 𝐵), where 𝐵 is single forward+backward cost and 𝒯 is the number of sampled 𝑡, 𝜖 per data. Using single sample reduces this to 𝒪(𝒟 𝐵), which is key to keeping the cost reasonable for modern video datasets and models, while reusing sample across data allows low enough variance for stable rankings. Projection adds 𝒪(𝐷 log 𝐷) per example using Fastfood [Le et al., 2014], negligible relative to backward pass. Gradient Storage. Storing full gradients is 𝒪(𝒟 𝐷). We instead store only projected vectors, 𝒪(𝒟 𝐷), plus the structured Fastfood state, 𝒪(𝐷). Since 𝐷 is typically orders of magnitude smaller than 𝐷, this transformation makes storage tractable for billion-parameter models. Data Ranking Compute. Influence computation in Eq. 10 is an inner product in R𝐷, so evaluating all train examples against query is 𝒪(𝒟 𝐷), and sorting is 𝒪(𝒟 log 𝒟). Additional Motion-Emphasis Compute. Motion-specific overhead primarily stems from AllTracker mask extraction with complexity 𝒪(𝒟 𝐻 𝑊 𝐹 ) for clip length 𝐹 and frame resolution 𝐻 𝑊 . Masks are extracted once, cached, and negligible relative to gradient cost. We provide detailed runtime breakdown in App. G.1. 4. Experiment 4.1. Setup Fine-tuning Datasets. We evaluate our motion attribution framework on two large-scale video datasets: VIDGEN-1M [Tan et al., 2024] and 4DNeX-10M [Chen et al., 2025], both of which offer diverse motion patterns, rich temporal dynamics, and complex scenes. For our experiments, we use 10k videos from both datasets, which provide sufficient scale and diversity to thoroughly evaluate motion attribution methods across different temporal patterns and video generation scenarios. Motion Query Data. To evaluate our motion attribution, we curate set of query videos representing distinct motion patterns and scenarios. Our query dataset consists of videos spanning 10 motion categories, with focus on object dynamics: compress, bounce, roll, explode, float, free fall, slide, spin, stretch, swing. Five videos, totaling 50 queries, represent each motion type. These videos are chosen for their clear, isolated motions, serving as basis for evaluating attribution quality and downstream motion generation. Further details on query video curation are provided in App. F.2. Model & Baselines. All experiments primarily use pretrained Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, widely used open-source baseline with strong performance and feasible compute. We provide additional results on Wan2.2-TI2V-5B in App. C. Our baselines: Base model (pretrained, no fine-tuning); Full fine-tuning (approximate upper bound using the complete dataset); Random selection (uniform sampling); Motion magnitude (selects videos with the highest average motion magnitude); V-JEPA embeddings (selects most representative videos of motion patterns using self-supervised spatiotemporal V-JEPA [Assran et al., 2025] features, capturing high-level 7 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Figure 2: Motion attribution examples. Top: Query clips showing float (left) and roll (right) motions. Middle: Top-ranked positive training samples identified by Motive with high influence scores. Bottom: Negative influence samples with minimal, camera-only motion, or cartoon-style content that conflict with target motions. motion semantics); and Ours w/o motion masking (influence of the entire video level without motion-specific masking). Benchmark. We evaluate our attribution using VBench [Huang et al., 2024] metrics across six dimensions: subject consistency, background consistency, motion smoothness, dynamic degree, aesthetic quality, and imaging quality. Motion smoothness and dynamic degree are our primary targets for temporal dynamics, while other metrics ensure visual quality is maintained. We use custom evaluation prompts, following VBenchs descriptive style, designed for ten motion types (bounce, compress, explode, float, free fall, roll, slide, spin, stretch, swing), to assess our frameworks effectiveness for specific physical motions, with five prompts per motion type. Implementation Details. We finetune Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B with our Motive-selected high-quality video data following the official and DiffSynth-Studio implementation. During fine-tuning, we update only the DiT backbone while freezing the T5 text encoder and VAE. All models are trained at resolution of 480 832 with learning rate of 1 105. Specialist models are trained on single motion category selected data, while generalist models use aggregated selections (both with top 10% selection from VIDGEN-1M [Tan et al., 2024] or 4DNeX [Chen et al., 2025] with motion-weighted loss attribution). All training runs are conducted on 4-8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. With one A100 GPU, it takes approximately 150 hours to compute the influence score of 10k samples. This process is highly parallelizable, on 64 GPUs, taking 2.3 hours. The computed gradients can be reused for multiple selection queries, amortizing this one-time cost. 4.2. Main Results High-influence selection and negative filtering. Fig. 2 shows our motion-aware attribution ranks clips with clear, physically grounded dynamics and downranks those with little transferable motion. For rolling and floating, positives show continuous trajectories and smooth temporal evolution (turbulent water carrying objects; Motion Attribution for Video Generation Figure 3: Qualitative Comparisons. We compare four motion scenarios (compress, spin, slide, free fall) across the base model, random selection, and our method. Our approach yields more realistic motion dynamics. Supplementary videos are included. planetary rotation). Negatives are mostly static footage, camera-only motion, or cartoons whose simplified kinematics do not transfer. Our method promotes useful motions and filters data that dilutes temporal learning during fine-tuning, holding across categories and aligning with the following quantitative gains.

We evaluate our approach across different metrics using VBench [Huang et al., 2024], demonstrating consistent improvements in motion fidelity when fine-tuning with attribution-selected data compared to random sampling or naïve approaches. As shown in Tab. 1, Motive achieves the highest dynamic degree score (47.6%), significantly outperforming random selection (41.3%) and whole video attribution (43.8%). Our method also excels in subject consistency (96.3%) and aesthetic quality (46.0%), while maintaining competitive motion smoothness (96.3%). Notably, using only 10% of the training data, our approach surpasses the full fine-tuned model on dynamic degree (42.0%) and subject consistency (95.9%), demonstrating the superior empirical performance of motion-specific attribution for targeted fine-tuning. We further analyze the motion magnitude distribution of selected videos in App. D. 4.3. Human Evaluation Automated scores can miss perceptual motion quality, so we run human evaluation pairwise comparison protocol: participants view two generated videos and choose which shows better motion. We recruit 17 annotators and evaluate 10 motion categories. For each category, we prepare 5 test cases and compare our method to baselines across three pairings, yielding balanced set of judgments. Presentation order is randomized, and ties are allowed. We report win rate (fraction our method is preferred), tie rate, and overall preference. As shown in the table, annotators favor our attribution-guided selection: 74.1% win rate vs. the base model and 53.1% vs. the full fine-tuned model, showing perceptually meaningful motion improvements. Method Win (%) Tie (%) Loss (%) Ours vs. Base Ours vs. Random Ours vs. Full FT Ours vs. w/o MM 74.1 58.9 53.1 46.9 12.3 12.1 14.8 20.0 13.6 29.0 32.1 33.1 Table 2: Human evaluation. Pairwise comparisons across 50 videos with 17 participants (850 total). Win, tie, and loss rates show where our method is preferred, rated equal, or outperformed. 4.4. Ablations Single-timestep attribution. Using single timestep avoids the cost of averaging across timesteps while closely matching the multi-timestep baseline. With fixed 𝑡 = 751 (the midpoint of the 1000-step denoising trajectory), we obtain 𝜌 = 66% agreement with the ground truth computed using 10 evenly-spaced timesteps sampled according to the flow matching schedule. Using the same timestep for both training and testing is key to preserving relative rankings. High timesteps (early denoising) heavily corrupt inputs with noise, obscuring motion cues; low timesteps (late denoising) operate on nearly formed videos, where gradients reflect fine details rather than semantic structure. 𝑡 = 751 (mid-denoising) strikes balance, delivering high correlation and substantial compute savings. Averaging multiple timesteps yields minimal ranking gains, and incorporating late-timestep gradients can bias rankings. single fixed timestep is therefore sufficient for variance-reduced, scalable attribution. 10 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Figure 5: Impact of Frame-Length Normalization on Motion Attribution. Comparison of top-ranked samples for floating motion query. Left: With proper frame-length normalization, top samples consistently exhibit floating motion (waves, floating objects, surfing). Right: Without normalization, rankings are biased by video length, resulting in no coherent patterns among top samples. Projected Gradients Preserve Influence Rankings. Comparing full gradients for attribution is infeasible at billion-parameter scale. We reduce dimensionality with structured random projections that preserve influence geometry, ablating 𝐷 {128, . . . , 2048} against the full-gradient baseline. We assess ranking preservation via Spearman correlation with unprojected scores  (Fig. 4)  . Small projections preserve rankings poorly: 𝐷 = 128 yields 𝜌 = 46.9%. Preservation improves with size: 𝐷 = 512 reaches 𝜌 = 74.7%. Beyond that, gains are marginal while cost rises: 𝐷 = 1024 (𝜌 = 75.7%) and 𝐷 = 2048 (𝜌 = 76.1%). Thus, 𝐷 = 512 offers the best trade-off, scaling to large models while maintaining quality. 𝜌 t r n a Frame-Length Normalization. As in the Wan training protocol, we standardize all videos to 81 frames at 16 fps (satisfying the 4𝑛+1 constraint) for fair attribution across clips of different raw lengths. Without standardization, gradient-based scores correlate strongly with video length rather than motion quality (𝜌 = 78.0%), leading to longer clips ranking higher regardless of dynamics. Standardizing frames reduces spurious length correlations by 54.0% while preserving motion-based correlation, so rankings reflect motion rather than duration. As in Fig. 5, normalization clarifies motion-specific patterns. For floating queries with frame-length normalization (left), top-ranked samples consistently show wave dynamics, floating objects, and surfing, all matching the target motion. Without normalization (right), top samples lack coherent similarity because rankings are driven by clip length, harming motion-relevant training example identification. Projection Dimension Figure 4: Projection dimension analysis. Spearman correlation between projected and full gradients shows rapid improvement with projection dimension, with 512 providing strong tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. 5. Conclusion We address central and underexplored question in video diffusion: which training clips influence the motion in generated videos? We propose Motive, which traces generated dynamics back to influential training clips by isolating motion-specific gradients. Unlike image-based attribution, our method directly targets temporal dynamics, revealing how coherence and physical plausibility emerge from data. We show motion learning is traceable to specific examples, providing quantitative tool for diagnosing artifacts and enabling targeted data selection and curation, enabling more controllable and interpretable video diffusion models. As models scale, such data-level understanding will be essential for building robust and reliable generative systems. Limitations. (i) Motion saliency depends on the chosen tracker; severe occlusions or transparency can degrade masks. (ii) Camera-only motion and very subtle micro-motion remain challenging to separate without extra signals (e.g., camera pose). Further discussion is in App. G. 11 Motion Attribution for Video Generation"

Modern data attribution methods fall into two main groups [Hammoudeh and Lowd, 2024]: retraining-based methods (e.g., leave-one-out [Cook et al., 1982, Jia et al., 2021], downsampling (also known as subsampling or counterfactual influence) [Feldman and Zhang, 2020], Shapley-value [Wang et al., 2024a,b]) and gradientbased methods (influence-function family, including Influence Functions [Koh and Liang, 2017, Lorraine and Hossain, 2024], TracIn [Pruthi et al., 2020], and TRAK [Park et al., 2023]). Influence functions provide principled framework by approximating the effect of removing training point. TracIn [Pruthi et al., 2020] and TRAK [Park et al., 2023] make attribution feasible at scale. While effective for classification, these assume Motion Attribution for Video Generation mapping between training gradients and predictions, which becomes more complex in generative models. Data attribution refers to methods that trace how individual training examples (or subsets) influence models predictions or behavior. Formally, it assigns an attribution score to each training sample, estimating the extent to which that sample contributes (positively or negatively) to the models output on given test query or behavior. Influence data attribution is an example of nested optimization [Vicol et al., 2022, Lorraine, 2024] with other examples including differentiable games [Balduzzi et al., 2018, Lorraine et al., 2021, 2022b] and hyperparameter optimization [Raghu et al., 2021, Lorraine and Duvenaud, 2018, Mehta et al., 2024, Lorraine et al., 2020]. Before diffusion models, attribution methods were applied to supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression, where influence functions [Koh and Liang, 2017, Lorraine et al., 2022a] and scalable approximations such as TracIn [Pruthi et al., 2020], TRAK [Park et al., 2023], and TDA [Bae et al., 2024] quantified the impact of training examples on downstream predictions. Recent work adapted data attribution to diffusion models Georgiev et al. [2023], Zheng et al. [2023], Wang et al. [2025, 2024a], Lin et al. [2024], Brokman et al. [2024], Kwon et al. [2023], where iterative denoising introduces timestepdependent bias. Mlodozeniec et al. [2024] propose scalable approximations, while Xie et al. [2024] identify timestep-induced artifacts and normalization schemes. Concept-TRAK [Park et al., 2025] extends attribution to concepts by reweighting gradients with concept-specific rewards, enabling attribution to semantic factors. Wang et al. [2023a] instead design customization-based benchmark for text-to-image models, where models are fine-tuned on exemplar images with novel tokens and attribution is evaluated by whether it can recover the responsible exemplars. However, these are limited to image diffusion, which captures static appearance but not temporal dynamics. B.2. Motion in Video Generation Video diffusion extends image generation to time, requiring coherent motion across frames [Ho et al., 2022, Blattmann et al., 2023, Peebles and Xie, 2023, Wan et al., 2025, Agarwal et al., 2025]. large body of work builds temporal structure via attention layers [Wu et al., 2023], control signals [Chen et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023], feature correspondences [Geyer et al., 2023, Bao et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2024c], or consistency distillation [Wang et al., 2023b, Zhou et al., 2024]. Recent work has highlighted the challenge of decoupling motion from appearance in video diffusion transformers, where spatial and temporal information become entangled in the models representations [Shi et al., 2025]. However, understanding which training clips influence specific motion patterns in generated videos remains an open challenge. In parallel, motion has long been studied using optical flow and correspondence, from classical formulations [Horn and Schunck, 1981, Lucas and Kanade, 1981] to modern approaches such as RAFT [Teed and Deng, 2020], which improve accuracy and generalization. These priors are often repurposed during generation to guide dynamics, but they do not explain which training examples shaped models motion behavior. Our work addresses both gaps by introducing motion-aware data attribution framework specifically designed for video diffusion. We use motion-weighted gradients that disentangle temporal dynamics from static appearance, enabling us to trace generated motion patterns back to the most influential training clips. C. Additional Experiments C.1. Results on Different Video Generation Models We further test our framework on additional video generation architectures beyond Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B. We have included the experiment results of Motive on Wan2.2-TI2V-5B, which introduces much larger parameter count (5B vs. 1.3B) and new high-compression Wan2.2-VAE. The results in Tab. 5 show that our approach works effectively across different model designs. 19 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Model Method () / Metric () Subject Consist.

Following the same setting in 4, we extend the VBench [Huang et al., 2024] evaluation to Wan2.2-TI2V-5B, larger-scale text-to-video model. Random selection and our Motive both select 10% of the training data, with our method using majority vote aggregation (3.5) across all motion queries. Results demonstrate that Motive generalizes effectively to different models. MM: motion masking. p f b i d t e % Mean Motion Magnitude Motion Bin (a) Motion Distribution Figure 6: Motive is not simply selecting motion-rich\" clips. Our influence scores are computed via gradients, and training videos are considered influential only when they directly improve the models ability to generate the target motion dynamics, not because they contain more motion overall. (b) Distribution Across Motion Bins D. Analysis D.1. Motion Distribution Analysis Motive is not simply selecting motion-rich\" clips: The key distinction is that our influence scores are computed via gradients, and training videos are considered influential only when they directly allow the model to lower the loss, improving the models ability to generate the target motion dynamics, not because they contain more motion overall. To empirically validate this, we further analyze the distribution of motion magnitudes in our selected data. We compute the mean motion magnitude for 10k videos in the VIDGEN dataset and compare the distributions of the top 10% (highest influence scores) and the bottom 10% (lowest influence scores). As shown in Fig. 6, the top 10% selected videos have mean motion magnitude of 3.85, which is only 4.3% higher than the bottom 10% (3.69), despite representing opposite extremes of influence scores. The analysis also shows that within the moderate-motion range (bins 3, 4, and 5), the top 10% of positive-influence samples outnumber the bottom 10% of negative-influence samples. Yet, both groups also appear in low-motion bins (0-2) and high-motion bins (6-9). This distribution pattern shows that high-influence videos selected by Motive span the entire motion spectrum, not just high-motion regions. Many high-motion videos receive low influence scores, while numerous influential videos exhibit modest or even low motion magnitude. These findings show that our motion attribution approach captures training influence, focusing on motion rather than simply acting as motion-saliency filter. 20 Motion Attribution for Video Generation (a) 4DNEX Influence Heatmap (b) VIDGEN Influence Heatmap Figure 7: Cross-motion influence overlap across datasets. Heatmaps showing the percentage overlap of top-100 influential training samples across motion categories for (a) 4DNEX and (b) VIDGEN datasets. Each cell (𝑖, 𝑗) shows the percentage of motion category 𝑖s influential data (aggregated from 5 queries per category) that also appears in motion category 𝑗s top-100 influential samples. The asymmetric nature of the matrices (e.g., bouncefloat = floatbounce) arises because different motion categories have different numbers of unique influential videos, leading to directional overlap percentages. Consistent high-overlap pairs (e.g., bounce-float: 44.4%/46.3%) and low-overlap pairs (e.g., free fall-stretch: 12.8%/12.7%) across datasets validate that these influence patterns reflect fundamental aspects of motion representation in video generation models. D.2. Cross-Motion Influence Patterns To analyze cross-motion influence patterns, we examine the percentage overlap of top-100 influential training data across different motion categories in both 4DNEX and VIDGEN datasets. As described in 4, we use 5 query samples to identify the top-100 most influential training videos, aggregating results across queries. As shown in Fig. 7, both datasets exhibit remarkably similar patterns with mean overlaps of 24.0% and 24.3%, respectively, indicating moderate sharing of influential data across motion categories. Both datasets consistently identify the same high-overlap pairs: bounce-float (44.4%/46.3%), compress-float (40.1%/34.0%), and compress-spin (36.9%/39.6%), suggesting these motions share fundamental characteristics that the model learns from similar training examples. Conversely, low-overlap pairs such as free fall-stretch (12.8%/12.7%) and float-slide (14.0%/10.9%) indicate more specialized influential data for mechanically dissimilar motions. The influence matrices are asymmetric because the number of unique influential samples shared across the 5 query samples differs across motion categories. The similar cross-motion influence patterns observed across both the 4DNEX and VIDGEN datasets demonstrate that these relationships are generalizable across different video datasets and reflect dynamic similarity. E. Additional Method Details Tracker-agnostic scope. We treat the motion estimator as pluggable source of saliency rather than training dependency. Given displacement magnitudes, we construct latent-space weights via bilinear mapping and normalization. Our implementation supports alternative estimators (such as dense optical flow or point tracking) with identical interfaces, enabling users to swap AllTracker without modifying the attribution code. Model-agnostic scope. Our attribution only requires per-example gradients under matched (𝑡fix, 𝜖fix), and therefore applies to both diffusion and flow-matching objectives. The score reduces to gradient inner product under fixed preconditioner; the generator architecture affects gradient statistics but not the definition of influence. In practice, replacing the denoiser or velocity field leaves the weighting and aggregation unchanged. 21 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Algorithm 1 Motive: Motion-Aware Data Attribution Framework Require: fine-tuning corpus 𝒟ft = {(v𝑛, c𝑛)}𝑁 Ensure: Motion-aware influence scores {𝐼mot(v𝑛, ˆv)}𝑁 1: for (v𝑛, c𝑛) 𝒟ft do 2: 3: 𝑛=1 𝑛=1 𝐴𝑛 AllTracker(v𝑛) Downsample and normalize to latent-space motion mask W𝑛 (Eqs. 1315) Evaluate motion-weighted loss ℒmot(𝜃; v𝑛, c𝑛) (Eq. 16) Compute motion gradient gmot(𝜃, v𝑛, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) = 𝜃ℒmot(𝜃; v𝑛, c𝑛, 𝑡fix, 𝜖fix) Normalize by frame length: gmot gmot/𝐹 Project motion gradient: gmot(𝜃, v𝑛) := Pgmot(𝜃,v𝑛,𝑡fix,𝜖fix) Pgmot(𝜃,v𝑛,𝑡fix,𝜖fix) (Eq. 17) 4: 5: 6: 7: , query video (ˆv, ˆc), fixed (𝑡fix, 𝜖fix), projection matrix Extract per-pixel flow displacements D𝑓 (Eq. 12) 8: end for 9: Compute query gradient: gmot(𝜃, ˆv) using the same procedure for (ˆv, ˆc) 10: for 𝑛 = 1, . . . , 𝑁 do 11: 12: end for 13: Rank all training clips by 𝐼mot(v𝑛, ˆv) and select top-𝐾 influential samples using majority vote aggregation 𝐼mot(v𝑛, ˆv) = gmot(𝜃, ˆv)gmot(𝜃, v𝑛) (Eq. 17) (Eq. 18): 𝒮 = 𝒮vote(𝐾) = {v𝑛v𝑛 in top-𝐾 by MajVote} 14: return 𝒮 Algorithm Summary.

F. Additional Experiment Details F.1. Hyperparameter Settings For reproducibility, we document the hyperparameters used throughout attribution, subset selection, and fine-tuning. Where values were not explicitly tuned, we adopted defaults from DiffSynth-Studio and the official Wan repo. Attribution. Motion-aware influence estimation is computed at single fixed timestep 𝑡fix = 751, corresponding to scheduler index 500 at the midpoint of the denoising trajectory, which strongly correlates with multitimestep averaging. shared Gaussian draw 𝜖fix 𝒩 (0, I) is used across all trainingquery pairs to reduce stochastic variance. Gradients are projected from dimension 𝐷 = 1 418 996 800 to 𝐷 = 512 using Fastfood JohnsonLindenstrauss projection selected via the search in Fig.4 to balance performance and storage. Motion weights are computed from AllTracker flow magnitudes 𝑀𝑓 , minmax normalized to [0, 1] with small bias 𝜁 = 106. All computations use bfloat16 precision for memory efficiency. Subset Selection & fine-tuning. For any number of query points, we select top-10% data of the datasets. We finetune the Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B backbone while freezing both the T5 text encoder [Raffel et al., 2020] and the VAE. The input resolution is fixed to 480 832 pixels. We use learning rate of 1 105 and the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017] following the DiffSynth-Studio defaults. We train the models for 1 epoch, repeating the dataset 50 times. Evaluation. The test set consists of the same 10 motion categories, but with different visual appearances, compared with the query set. We provide the prompt samples below. 22 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Samples from Query Set We illustrate representative prompts from our query set used to generate query videos with Veo-3. compress: slice of sandwich bread flattened by flat metal plate, steady camera, soft studio lighting, plain backdrop; emphasize air pockets collapsing. bounce: ping-pong ball bouncing on white table, steady side camera, neutral light, seamless backdrop; emphasize consistent bounce height and timing. roll: spool of thread rolling from left to right, close-up static camera, bright studio light; highlight axle rotation and smooth travel. explode: single balloon bursting into fragments, captured in high-speed slow motion with fixed camera, bright even lighting, seamless background; emphasize outward debris and air release. float: foam cube floating on the surface of water, static overhead camera, bright light, clean tank; emphasize buoyancy and slight rocking. Samples from Test Set We illustrate representative prompts from our test set that our fine-tuned models use to generate test videos. compress: rubber ball being compressed under flat press, filmed with stationary camera. Bright, shadowfree lighting and clean background emphasize the deformation as it flattens. bounce: basketball bouncing vertically on wooden court plank, unmoving camera, balanced indoor lighting, plain wall background; clearly show deformation at impact. roll: bike tire rolling freely on stand, static side camera, indoor neutral light; show uniform rotation without wobble. explode: fragile glass ornament breaking apart mid-air, fixed camera, bright controlled lighting, plain backdrop; capture shards and reflections crisply. float: green leaf floating gently on perfectly still water in transparent tank, fixed top-down camera, bright even lighting; emphasize surface tension ripples. F.2. Details on Motion Query Data small, controlled set of query videos is constructed to isolate specific motion primitives while minimizing confounding factors (e.g., textured backgrounds, uncontrolled camera motion). Such clean and consistent clips are challenging to obtain from natural data sources. To address this, we synthesize the query set using Veo-3 [Google DeepMind, 2025] and apply strict post-generation screening for physical plausibility and generation realism. We target ten motion types: compress, bounce, roll, explode, float, free fall, slide, spin, stretch, swing. For each category, we retain 5 query samples, yielding total of 50 queries. This scale provides adequate coverage of the motion taxonomy used in our evaluations while maintaining tractable attribution computation. We further provide few examples of the generation prompts and the generated video query set in Fig. 8. Rationale for synthetic queries. The query set is not used as training data; instead, it specifies targets for attribution and for multi-query aggregation. Synthetic generation offers controllability that is difficult to achieve at scale with web videos. This design yields near-realistic yet standardized stimuli aligned with our goal of probing motion-specific influence. G. Discussion G.1. Runtime We provide detailed runtime breakdown from our experiments on 10k training samples with Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B model to address scalability concerns. The key insight is that the dominant cost of our pipeline is computing per-training-sample gradients, which is performed once and then can be reused for all subsequent queries. Each 23 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Figure 8: Illustration of motion query set. We generate near-realistic video queries with Veo-3 across ten motion categories. Each category contains five query videos synthesized with controlled prompts and manually screened for clarity and physical plausibility.

Detailed computational complexity and runtime for each component of our motion attribution framework on 10k training samples with Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B model. training clips gradient is projected into compact 512-dimensional vector, and adding new query requires only (i) single backward pass to obtain its own projected 512-dimensional gradient and (ii) computing cosine similarity between the query vector and stored training vectors, which is exceptionally lightweight (on the order of seconds). Thus, the computational burden does not scale with the number of queries but only with the size of the training set. As shown in Tab. 6, the dominant cost is the one-time training data gradient computation ( 150 hours on 1 A100), which is amortized across all queries. Once computed, adding new query requires only 54 seconds (gradient computation) + 46ms (influence computation) = 54 seconds total. The training data gradient computation is embarrassingly parallel and can be reduced to 2.3 hours with 64 GPUs. Runtime comparison with baselines. We compare the computational cost of our method with the baseline approaches for processing 10k training samples on single GPU  (Table 7)  . While our method requires more upfront computation than the baseline approaches, this cost is amortized across all queries, and the computed gradients can be reused for multiple selection queries, making it practical for large-scale data curation scenarios. 24 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Method Total for 10k (1 GPU) < 1 second Random Motion Magnitude Optical Flow 5.7 hours 5.5 hours V-JEPA"

Total computational time required for processing 10k training samples on single GPU across different data selection methods. G.2. Limitations Gradient-based attribution is computationally expensive, requiring high upfront cost for per-sample gradient computation (see G.1), though this cost is amortized across queries. Our analysis treats each video as whole unit, thereby avoiding collapsing motion into frame-level appearance, but it risks overlooking the fact that only certain segments may carry motion-relevant information. Highly informative intervals can be diluted when averaged with static or redundant portions of the same clip. This suggests an open direction toward finer-grained attribution at the motion segment or motion event level, which could reveal more precise insights into how different phases of trajectory shape motion learning. Another limitation is that our motion masks may overemphasize camera-only motion; we detect this by spatial uniformity of and down-weight such clips, but full disentanglement of ego and object motion remains future work. Additionally, our framework does not explicitly account for classifier-free guidance (CFG), which is widely used in practice to steer video generation but introduces discrepancies between training-time attribution and inference-time dynamics. As result, our influence estimates may not fully capture how guidance alters motion behavior. In addition, while attribution-driven fine-tuning improves targeted motion quality, it may introduce trade-offs with base model capabilities. This raises the need for future work on balancing targeted motion adaptation with the preservation of broader generative capabilities. G.3. Future Directions Tracker-robust motion saliency. Replace or ensemble AllTracker with alternative estimators and use its confidence/visibility channels to weight masks. Closed-loop data curation. Move from one-shot ranking to active selection: iteratively attribute, finetune, and re-attribute, or replace simple majority voting with learned query weights. Safety and governance. Use negative-influence filtering to suppress undesirable or unsafe dynamics, document curator choices, and audit motion behaviors exposed by our framework. Sophisticated finetuning. Move to more sophisticated finetuning setups, such as multi-student distillation [Song et al., 2024]. Other modalities. Extend our methodology to other modalities, including world models [Zhu et al., 2025], audio [Evans et al., 2025, Richter-Powell et al., 2025] or video+audio [Wiedemer et al., 2025]. Self-generated video queries. Use model-generated videos as queries to trace problematic motion patterns (e.g., unrealistic physics) back to training data, enabling iterative diagnostics and targeted motion improvement. H. Visualization H.1. Motion Visualization To provide intuition for the behavior of our motion-weighted loss, we visualize the motion magnitude as an overlay. We compute per-pixel motion magnitude using optical flow and apply motion-based weighting that preserves the appearance of dynamic regions while attenuating static backgrounds. This motion overlay directly illustrates the spatial weighting applied by our motion loss during training. Fig. 9 presents representative frames from our dataset, comparing original frames with their corresponding motion overlays for seven distinct video samples. These visualizations show that the motion-weighted loss preferentially emphasizes dynamic content while down-weighting static scene elements. 25 Motion Attribution for Video Generation Figure 9: Motion overlay visualization. Comparison of original frames and motion overlays for seven video samples across three time points (early, middle, late). The motion overlay demonstrates the spatial weighting of our motion loss: dynamic regions remain visible, while static backgrounds are attenuated to neutral gray. Takeaway: This provides heuristic intuition into what information our motion attribution focuses on: the information in grayer regions, which lack motion, is down-weighted by our method."
