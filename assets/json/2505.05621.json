            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Multimodal large language models have made groundbreaking progress in visual generation [27, 46, 7, 42, 19]. Among them, OpenAIs GPT-4o [29] stands out for its ability to interpret complex visual and textual inputs to generate semantically accurate, visually realistic images. Meanwhile, image restoration can be naturally formulated as conditional image generation task [14, 38], where degraded images serve as visual conditioning inputs. By providing an appropriate prompt, GPT-4os generative capabilities can be directed toward image restoration. This capability represents major leap forward in multimodal generation and has prompted renewed consideration of its role in image restoration tasks (see Fig. 1). Traditionally, image restoration methods rely on degradation-specific network architectures designed to achieve high performance on individual tasks, such as image denoising [15, 30], image deblurring [28, 49, 2, 5, 45], image super-resolution [26, 10], image inpainting [41, 9], and image dehazing [40, 33, 4, 50]. While these methods are effective within their respective domains, they often lack flexibility and exhibit poor generalization across diverse degradation types. Although some recent efforts have explored unified, all-in-one frameworks capable of handling multiple restoration tasks within single model [44, 31, 6, 16], such approaches have yet to demonstrate scalability or consistent performance across varied restoration scenarios. Given its powerful visual generation and semantic understanding capabilities, GPT-4o naturally emerges as potential foundation model for all-in-one image restoration [16]. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of GPT-4o in the context of image restoration, uncovering both its promising strengths and current limitations. Building on these insights, we further explore Preprint. Under review. (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1: Image restoration results of GPT-4o on real world degradation. The first row and second row are degraded inputs and the restored outputs, respectively. (a)-(d) correspond to low-light conditions, heavy noise, motion blur, and dense haze, respectively. simple baseline approach that leverages GPT-4o as plug-and-play component to enhance the performance of existing restoration networks. The study is organized into three parts. (i) Restoration Capability of GPT-4o: We evaluate GPT-4o on eight diverse image restoration tasks through both quantitative and qualitative analysis. While the restored images are visually appealing (as reflected by CLIP-IQA scores), they often suffer from lack of pixel-level structural fidelity, as indicated by lower PSNR scores even compared with the degraded image (e.g., 12.89 dB vs. 21.58 dB). (ii) Failure Cases: Although GPT-4o generally preserves overall image semantics, it often fails to maintain pixel-level structural fidelity. This is primarily due to three limitations: distortion of image proportions, inaccuracies in object positioning and quantity, and inconsistencies in viewpoint reconstruction, which are often critical for low-level image restoration tasks. (iii) Baseline: Although GPT-4o performs poorly in preserving pixel-level structural fidelity, its visually pleasing outputs can serve as strong visual priors. We propose lightweight post-processing baseline that leverages GPT-4os outputs to enhance the performance of image restorations."

            "content": "Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 present the restoration results of GPT-4o on eight representative types of realworld degradation. The degraded images are collected from datasets related to deraining [11, 37], desnowing [24], dehazing [50, 8], low-light enhancement [23, 25], motion deblurring [28, 32, 51], defocus deblurring [43, 20, 2], underwater image enhancement [36, 22, 13], and denoising [21, 1], as well as from web sources. For the real-world images with ground truth shown in Fig. 3, we report quantitative metrics including PSNR [12] and CLIP-IQA [35]. The first metric evaluates pixel-level structural fidelity, while the latter two assess perceptual quality. Overall, GPT-4o delivers visually compelling restorations across wide range of image restoration tasks, showcasing its versatility. For example, in deraining and desnowing, it effectively removes occlusions like rain streaks and snow buildup, restoring clean scenes with preserved fine details in trees, pedestrians, and vehicles. These results highlight GPT-4os potential not only in task-specific restoration but also as unified foundation model for general-purpose low-level vision restoration. However, as shown in Fig. 4, while GPT-4o achieves high CLIP-IQA scores (indicating strong perceptual quality), its PSNR values are often lower than even those of the degraded input. This reveals significant limitation: poor preservation of pixel-level structural fidelity, which is critical for many practical restoration applications."

We display the PSNR and CLIP-IQA scores below each image, reflecting perceptual quality and pixel-level structural fidelity, respectively. Variations in Image Proportions. As shown in the left part of Fig. 4, GPT-4o fails to preserve the original aspect ratio during restoration, leading to noticeable geometric distortions. Such inconsisten3 (a) (b) (c) Figure 4: Failure cases. (a) Variations in image proportions. (b) Shifts in object positions and quantities. (c) Changes in viewpoint. cies disrupt visual coherence and can be detrimental to downstream tasks that depend on accurate spatial representation. Shifts in Object Positions and Quantities. In the middle example of Fig. 4, GPT-4o exhibits poor control over object presence and placement. For instance, it inadvertently removes roadside tree, despite no instruction to modify the scene content. This highlights key challenge in maintaining structural and semantic consistency for low-level vision tasks within multimodal generation frameworks. Changes in Viewpoint. On the right side of Fig. 4, GPT-4o applies slight scaling and cropping, which alters the original camera viewpoint. As result, certain scene elements, such as swing set in the lower-left corner, are partially or entirely lost. Such viewpoint shifts can undermine restoration reliability, especially when precise scene reconstruction is required. While GPT-4o demonstrates impressive generative capabilities and generalization across diverse image restoration tasks, it exhibits notable limitations in maintaining geometric consistency, accurate object placement, and stable viewpoints for achieving high pixel-level structure fidelity. These shortcomings can be critical in applications where spatial precision is essential. Addressing them will be vital for advancing the reliability of multimodal models in low-level image restoration tasks."

            "title": "4 A Baseline Solution",
            "content": "We take image dehazing as test case and explore baseline network, as plug-in-and-play model, that post-processes GPT-4os restoration outputs to improve pixel-level structural fidelity. Implementation Details. We adopt Restormer [47] enhanced with Deformable Convolutions [52] as our post-processing network. The degraded image is fed into the model, and the restoration output from GPT-4o is fused at the feature level via element-wise addition. The prompt used to instruct GPT-4o for image restoration is: Please remove the {degradation type} from the image. The processed image should remain aligned with the input image. The network is trained using the charbonnier loss [17] for the O-Haze dataset [3] (40 training and 5 testing images), Rain800 dataset [48] (485 training and 15 testing images), and LOL [39] (700 training and 100 testing images). All experiments are conducted using NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and implemented in PyTorch. Training is performed using the Adam optimizer [18] with an initial learning rate of 2 104, decayed via cosine annealing schedule. We use batch size of 2, and input images are randomly cropped into 256 256 patches. Standard data augmentation techniques, including random horizontal flipping and random rotation, are applied. The network is trained for total of 150,000 iterations. Results. We compare two baselines: (1) the direct restoration output from GPT-4o, and (2) standard Restormer model trained to restore directly from the degraded image. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented in Fig. 5 and Tab. 1, respectively. The proposed pipeline using GPT-4o outputs as visual priors achieves significantly higher scores in perceptual quality metrics (e.g., 0.566 in CLIP-IQA on the O-Haze dataset), indicating improved visual appeal. At the same time on the 4 Degraded Ground Truth GPT-4o Baseline Ours Figure 5: Comparisons on the Rain800 [48], LOL [39], and O-HAZE [3] datasets. Rows 12 show results on Rain800 dataset, Rows 34 are results on LOL dataset, and Rows 56 are for O-HAZE dataset. GPT-4o denotes the image restoration results generated by GPT-4o. Baseline refers to the restoration results without using GPT-4o priors, while Ours indicates the enhanced restoration results guided by GPT-4o priors.

We present visual comparison in Fig. 5. The first column shows the degraded hazy input images, the fourth column displays the restoration results from the baseline Restormer (without GPT-4o guidance), and the last column presents the outputs of our proposed method incorporating aligned GPT-4o priors. Across variety of challenging scenes, our method consistently produces clearer restorations with reduced haze artifacts compared to the baseline. For example, in the outdoor bench scene, our approach successfully recovers realistic color tones and fine details in the bricks and benches, whereas the baseline result appears desaturated and lacks contrast. Similarly, in the forest pathway scene, our method restores distant foliage and pathway textures with enhanced sharpness and color fidelity. Consistent improvements are also observed on deraining and low-light enhancement tasks, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. These improvements highlight the effectiveness of integrating GPT-4o-generated priors to enhance restoration quality."

            "content": "We further compare GPT-4o with another state-of-the-art multimodal model, Gemini 2.0 [34], on image restoration in Fig. 6. GPT-4o consistently delivers clearer and more structurally faithful restorations than Gemini 2.0. Notably, GPT-4o better preserves fine details such as thin object boundaries and texture continuity, whereas Gemini 2.0 occasionally introduces artifacts or overly smooths subtle scene elements. These observations suggest that GPT-4o currently provides superior visual fidelity for restoration-oriented generation tasks. However, both models exhibit minor misalignments at the pixel level, reinforcing the need for alignment mechanisms when integrating generative priors into low-level vision pipelines. Furthermore, there is notable difference in computational efficiency: GPT-4o requires an average of 82 seconds per image, while Gemini 2.0 completes the same task in just 15 seconds. This highlights practical trade-off between restoration quality and inference speed that must be considered for real-world deployment."

            "content": "In this study, we present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o for image restoration across diverse degradations. While GPT-4o demonstrates impressive generative capabilities and produces visually appealing results, it often struggles with maintaining pixel-level structural fidelity manifested through issues such as geometric distortions, object misplacement, and viewpoint inconsistencies. We identify these limitations through detailed analysis and demonstrate that GPT-4o outputs can serve as strong visual priors to enhance restoration quality when paired with lightweight post-processing network. This approach effectively combines GPT-4os perceptual strengths with traditional restoration models, leading to improved structural fidelity without compromising visual appeal. We hope our findings 6 offer valuable insights into the effective use of large multimodal models for image restoration and inspire future research in this emerging direction."
