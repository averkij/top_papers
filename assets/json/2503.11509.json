Introduction Graphics programming languages offer distinct advantages over low-level vector formats (PDF, SVG) or raster image formats by representing visual concepts as high-level programs that preserve semantics, remain human-interpretable, and allow manual editing. These properties are particularly valuable to the scientific research community, where specialized graphics programming languages like TikZ [1] are popular for creating complex figures with high expressivity. However, this comes with steep learning curve, as evidenced 3D contour plot of loss function. multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers. Gaussian probability density function (blue) with markers showing one standard deviation (red). Figure 1. Qualitative comparison of our TikZero+ model (last two columns) and the end-to-end trained baseline AutomaTikZv2 (LLM; first two columns) on text-guided graphics program synthesis with TikZ. Our method generates outputs that more closely follow the given captions. Example program listings are in Appendix E. by the TEX Stack Exchange2 (TEX.SE), where nearly 10% of questions concern TikZ and make it the most frequently discussed topic on the platform [2, 3]. With recent advances in generative AI, simplifying the creation of graphics programs has become increasingly feasible. Belouadi et al. [2] introduce DeTikZify, an inverse graphics model that generates TikZ programs from images and handdrawn sketches. However, creating these visual inputs stays cumbersome, motivating alternative input modalities such as natural language. While Belouadi et al. [3] propose AutomaTikZ, text-guided synthesis model for TikZ programs trained end-to-end on an aligned caption-program corpus, its performance remains limited (cf. Fig. 1) [4, 5]. 1https://github.com/potamides/DeTikZify 2https://tex.stackexchange.com 1 AutomaTikZ Limited to caption-aligned graphics programs only. Images with Captions Graphics Programs DeTikZify Accesses all graphics programs but without text guidance. TikZero Leverages captioned images and graphics programs independently. Figure 2. Illustration of training data availability for graphics program synthesis. DeTikZify can leverage all graphics programs for training but lacks text guidance, while AutomaTikZ is constrained to the small intersection of captioned graphics programs, resulting in limited performance. Our approach, TikZero, trains independently on both graphics programs and captioned images, enabling more effective use of available data and yielding superior results. We identify insufficient training data as the primary limitation. Unlike inverse graphics models such as DeTikZify, which are inherently self-supervised (trained by being conditioned on compiled representations of their output programs) and can access sufficient training data (cf. Fig. 2), end-toend text-guided models like AutomaTikZ require graphics programs paired with captions, substantially reducing the available data pool (cf. Fig. 2). To address this challenge, we decouple the graphics program generation component from text understanding, enabling independent training on graphics programs and captioned images without requiring paired data (cf. Fig. 2). Our approach first trains an inverse graphics model conditioned on image patch embeddings from vision encoder [6]. We then train an adapter network that generates synthetic image patch embeddings from captions. This adapter training relies solely on captioned images, effectively circumventing resource limitations and enabling zero-shot (in the sense that no aligned caption-program examples are involved in the training process) text-guided graphics program synthesis. We demonstrate that this approach, to which we refer as TikZero, outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods (cf. Fig. 1). Our key contributions are: (i) novel two-stage architecture, TikZero, which addresses the low-resource challenge in text-guided graphics program synthesis by aligning representation spaces rather than relying on aligned data. (ii) The DaTikZv3 dataset, comprising over 450k TikZ graphics programs with approximately 170k captioned samples. Using this dataset, we train both TikZero and AutomaTikZv2 (an updated version of AutomaTikZ) on the same source data, demonstrating that TikZero outperforms AutomaTikZ, AutomaTikZv2, and other end-to-end trained baselines. (iii) An enhanced model, TikZero+, combining TikZero with the end-to-end fine-tuning of AutomaTikZv2, which surpasses larger baselines and matches the performance of commercial models like GPT-4o [7] on key metrics. 2. Related Work Inverse Graphics Program Synthesis Inverse graphics, i.e., synthesizing graphics program to reproduce visual target, represents specialized instance of neural program synthesis [810]. Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in this domain [1113], with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly gaining prominence [2, 14 16]. While controlled experimental studies often rely on synthetic datasets [12, 14, 1619], real-world applications typically leverage more complex and diverse human-created data [2, 2024], highlighting the importance of data availability. In scientific contexts, TikZ has emerged as popular choice due to its versatility, expressiveness, and widespread adoption in academic circles [2, 2022, 24]. Although these approaches are not tailored to text-guided generation, we incorporate key elements from them into our approach. Text-Guided Graphics Program Synthesis Current textguided approaches to graphics program synthesis remain limited, mainly because of the scarcity of captioned graphics programs outlined in Sec. 1, but also because of the difficulty of generating synthetic data with human-like captions [25, 26]. Researchers interested in this capability currently rely on the emerging capabilities of large commercial models such as GPT-4o [7, 2729], which raises concerns about accessibility, reproducibility, and computational cost [30]. In contrast, related domains like vector graphics generation [23, 3134] and NL2Vis [3539] have shown more progress. Similar to inverse graphics, these fields increasingly incorporate large language models (LLMs) [23, 35, 39]. However, vector graphics approaches typically generate only low-level Bézier curves, limiting output complexity [2, 31, 32], and NL2Vis focuses exclusively on data visualization with restricted set of visualization types [39]. More complex applications, such as generating arbitrary scientific figures from captions with TikZ, remain underexploreda gap we address in this work. Text-to-Image Generation TikZero shares conceptual and architectural similarities with several text-to-image generation methods [4044]. Rodriguez et al. [45, 46] explore generative adversarial networks [47, 48] and diffusion models [49, 50] for scientific figure generation, but these approaches are tied to raster images, which are not ideal for representing scientific figures. Ramesh et al. [42] propose two-stage model with independently trained prior and decoder components to generate raster images from text. Although 2 prior networks resemble our adapters and have been used with inverse graphics models [51], they target global image embeddings containing only abstract information, which degrades performance when used with inverse graphics architectures that work best with patch-level details [52]. In contrast, our adapters specifically operate on patch-level embeddings, and we demonstrate that this improves performance compared to end-to-end trained baselines. 3. The TikZero Model & Architecture As the foundation of TikZero, we first develop state-of-theart inverse graphics model for graphics program synthesis. We then incorporate cross-attention adapter network [54] for text guidance. Fig. 3 provides an overview of our method. The Inverse Graphics Model Due to their demonstrated effectiveness (cf. Sec. 2), we adopt VLM architecture for the inverse graphics model of TikZero. Figure 3 illustrates its inner workings (dashed lines): the model processes rasterized images and autoregressively generates their corresponding programs without involving captions at this stage. The Adapter Network VLMs consist of two primary components: vision encoder that generates image embeddings and text decoder that, in our case, produces graphics programs conditioned on these embeddings. The unidirectional and localized flow of information between these components allows us to inject additional information solely into the vision encoder, thereby influencing the output of the text decoder. In our specific case, this setup enables the introduction of trainable, text-conditioned adapter network trained to mimic the outputs of the original vision encoder. This effectively enables zero-shot generation of graphics programs conditioned on text when these outputs are fed into the decoder. In addition to circumventing the resource limitations discussed in Sec. 1, this architecture has other welcome implications: During adapter training, the text decoder, usually the largest component of the model, does not need to be loaded, resulting in efficient and fast training even with large datasets. Our adapter incorporates lightweight text encoder for embedding captions and introduces newly initialized gated cross-attention layers [55, 56] before each vision encoder layer (cf., Fig. 3). The keys and values derive from the final text encoder representations, while the queries originate from trainable probe used instead of image inputs. The gates 𝛾 allow the model to learn at which layers and to what extent information from the text encoder should flow into the vision encoder. Contrary to existing literature, which often employs tanh gates [57] that initialize to zero (indicating no information flow), we find that using sigmoid gates (0.5 at initialization) accelerates training convergence since, in our case, only little information originates from the vision encoder inputs (i.e., the probe)."

Training Objective Given caption-image dataset for training, we first embed the patches 𝑝 𝒑 of image 𝑖 using the unmodified vision encoder of our VLM. Subsequently, we incorporate the cross-attention adapter to obtain the modified encoder (cid:98)M, which we then distill on these image patch embeddings conditioned solely on the caption 𝑡 and probe ˆ𝚤 [58]. This leads to the following objective: Ldist = (cid:16) dist 1 𝒑 𝑝 𝒑 M𝜃 ( 𝑝 𝑖 ), (cid:98)M𝜃 , ˆ𝜃 ( 𝑝 ˆ𝚤, 𝑡 ) (cid:17) , (1) where dist(𝒙, 𝒚) represents distance metric. Following common practices in model distillation [59, 60], we experiment with cosine distance and mean squared error. Here, 𝜃 denotes the original model parameters that remain fully frozen, while ˆ𝜃 represents the adapter parameters of which the cross-attention layers and the image probe are trainable. 4. Datasets & Model Training We introduce DaTikZv3, novel dataset of TikZ graphics programs designed to support the training and evaluation of TikZero. Additionally, we train AutomaTikZv2 as directly comparable baseline operating on the same data source. The DaTikZv3 Dataset DaTikZv3 expands upon its predecessors DaTikZ and DaTikZv2 [2, 3], incorporating programs from curated repositories, TEX.SE, arXiv papers, and artificial samples (cf. Tab. 1). While previous versions focused exclusively on TikZ graphics with (v1) or without (v2) captions, DaTikZv3 systematically extracts captions alongside TikZ graphics whenever possible to support our claims. From over 450k instances, fewer than 170k include captions, underscoring the challenges discussed in Sec. 1. Training TikZero TikZeros VLM builds upon DeTikZify [2] by conditioning LLaMA-based text decoder [61] on patch embeddings from SigLIP vision encoder [62]. Specifically, we combine LLaMA3.1 (8B) [56] with SigLIP SoViT (0.4B). Unlike DeTikZify and inspired by the continued ViT pretraining approach of InternVL 1.5 [63], we initialize the vision encoder with weights from the fine-tuned encoder of PaliGemma [64] and increase"

Solid lines represent the standard caption-conditioned path, which flows through the text encoder into the adapter network of TikZero before connecting to the vision encoder. In certain configurations (cf. Sec. 5.2), the caption also feeds into the text decoder (depicted by dotted lines and markers representing shortcuts). The selfand cross-attention layers (yellow) are simplified representations, omitting internal feed-forward layers and residual connections [53]. An exception is the explicit residual connection between the cross-attention and self-attention layers of the vision encoder, visualizing the gating mechanism 𝛾 (purple). Additionally, the dashed path illustrates how the inverse graphics model generates graphics programs when conditioned on images. the input resolution to 420 420 pixels. Furthermore, we fully fine-tune the vision encoder alongside the rest of the model instead of freezing it. We train on DaTikZv3 for 5 epochs with learning rate of 5e5 and batch size of 128. TikZeros VLM consistently outperforms DeTikZify, with detailed evaluation results provided in Appendix A. For the adapter network, we initialize with LLaMA3.2 (1B) as the text encoder [56] and leverage ArxivCap [25], dataset comprising 6.4 million scientific caption-image pairs for training. The adapter accounts for 2 billion of TikZeros 10 billion total parameters, with only 400 million being trainable. We train for 3 epochs with learning rate of 1e4 and batch size of 512. We emphasize that this two-stage training process does not access caption-program pairs. However, we demonstrate that incorporating such aligned data in subsequent fine-tuning step (Sec. 5.2) further enhances performance. Training AutomaTikZv2 Similar to its predecessor, AutomaTikZv2 is token-conditioned LLM that uses tokenized captions as conditioning information for graphics prediction (rather than patch embeddings). We initialize AutomaTikZv2 in two different ways: (i) AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), which starts from vanilla LLaMA3.1 (8B) weights, and (ii) AutomaTikZv2 (VLM), which leverages TikZeros trained VLM (minus the vision encoder) to benefit from transfer learning [65] on its larger training corpus. Both variants employ the same hyperparameters as TikZeros VLM but can only utilize the caption-annotated subset of DaTikZv3 for training. Despite having access to less caption-aligned data than TikZeros adapter network, AutomaTikZv2 requires longer training period primarily due to fine-tuning the large decoder (8 billion trainable parameters versus the adapter networks 400 million). Training requires more than two days for AutomaTikZv2 and 1.5 days for TikZeros adapter network when using eight Nvidia A100 40GB GPUs. 5. Experiments Before training models on DaTikZv3, we extract 1k samples from its captioned subset to form our test set. To mitigate data leakage from pretraining to testing, we only include instances created after the cut-off date specified by LLaMA3.2 and ArxivCap. We also employ an 𝑛-gram matching algorithm to avoid cross-contamination with our training split [7]. For all models, the temperature is set to 0.8 and top-p to 0.95. Example outputs are provided in Fig. 1 and Appendix E. Evaluation Metrics The multimodal nature of our task allows for various evaluation metrics in our automatic evaluations. We assess perceptual image similarity between generated outputs and references by computing DreamSim (DSim) [66, 67], which correlates highly with human judgments for scientific images [2]. We also calculate the Kernel Inception Distance (KID) [68] using SigLIP image features, which evaluates the overall quality of generated figures by comparing to the distribution of reference figures. We evaluate caption similarity between generated outputs and reference captions using CLIPScore (CLIP) [69] with SigLIP features. To measure code similarity between generated and reference TikZ programs, we use CrystalBLEU (cBLEU), BLEU variant optimized for code evaluation [70, 71], and TEX Edit Distance (TED) [2], variant of the Extended"

Edit Distance [72] utilizing TEX tokenizer. Since some metrics require that generated programs compile to images, resampling is necessary if the output contains irrecoverable errors. To quantify this, we compute the Mean Token Efficiency (MTE), defined as the 10% winsorized mean of the ratio between the number of tokens in the final TikZ program and the total number of tokens generated to produce that program. For comprehensive view of model performance, we calculate the arithmetic mean (AVG) of all previous metrics. As these metrics operate on different scales, we apply min-max normalization before computing the average. Additionally, some metrics are recomputed with redacted text in the outputs as part of our analysis, cf. Sec. 6.1. 5.1. Comparison against End-to-End Fine-Tuning In our initial experiment, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of TikZero, trained as described in Secs. 3 & 4 using either cosine distance (Cos) or mean squared error (MSE), and compare it against end-to-end trained baselines. Baselines Besides AutomaTikZv2 (LLM & VLM), which we designed as directly comparable baselines, we assess other token-conditioned models of similar and slightly larger sizes trained on TikZ or LATEX. Specifically, we evaluate AutomaTikZ (13B),3 the strongest original AutomaTikZ baseline [3], and the general-purpose chatbot IDEFICS 3 (8B) [21]. Further details are available in Appendix B. Results We present the system-level metric scores in Tab. 2 (Original Text). On average, TikZero, trained with cosine distance, achieves the best performance with an AVG score of 85.599, closely followed by the MSE variant at 85.004. The next best model, AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), scores 82.375, which is 3 percentage points (pp) lower. The remaining models exhibit substantial performance gap, with IDEFICS 3 (8B) and AutomaTikZ (13B) falling behind by approximately 20pp and AutomaTikZv2 (VLM) showing the weakest performance across all metrics, resulting in an AVG score of 3Belouadi et al. [3] refer to this model as CLiMA (13B). 0. The surprisingly poor results of AutomaTikZv2 (VLM) are likely due to catastrophic forgetting [73], as the removal of the vision encoder from TikZeros VLM necessitates reacquisition of conditioning based solely on text. As for individual metrics, our adapter-based models perform particularly well in perceptual image similarity, with TikZero (Cos) outperforming the best baseline, AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), by 3pp on DreamSim. Although AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) outperforms TikZero by 1.5pp on KID, this indicates in this context that such token-conditioned models (compared to those using patch embeddings) capture the general appearance of scientific figures well but fall short in inferring visual specifics from captions. They do, however, have an edge in reproducing text from captions, which we identify as the primary reason for up to 5pp higher CLIPScore, as noted in Sec. 6.1. Regarding code similarity, both TikZero models considerably outperform others on cBLEU. Interestingly, we observe mild inverse correlation between cBLEU and TED. Models conditioned solely on tokenized captions tend to generate shorter, often simplified programs [3], potentially resulting in reduced edit distance to the reference. In terms of efficiency, all models achieve an MTE of 8085, indicating that only 2 out of 10 inferences require resampling. TikZero (Cos) is 3pp more efficient than MSE, while AutomaTikZ (13B), likely benefiting from its larger model size, exceeds it by another 3pp. In summary, training AutomaTikZv2 on top of VLM yields worse performance than training based on vanilla LLaMA3.1, indicating that effective end-to-end training can only leverage the small intersection of graphics programs and images with captions, as illustrated in Fig. 2. However, even without access to this intersection, TikZero surpasses both AutomaTikZ (13B) and AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) on average by being able to train on images with captions independently of graphics programs. Moreover, using loss function based on cosine distance proves more effective than using MSE."

Overall, TikZero (Cos) with Weight Resetting (iii) demonstrates the strongest average performance across metrics. 5.2. Combining Adapters with Fine-Tuning In this section, we investigate whether explicitly incorporating the subset of DaTikZv3 that includes captions into the training process of TikZero enhances performance. Our approach involves three incremental stages: (i) We perform light fine-tuning of TikZero (Cos) end-to-end on captionprogram pairs for one epoch with low learning rate of 1e5. Extending the training duration or increasing the learning rate does not yield further performance gains, likely due to the decoder having already reached its saturation point; (ii) Alongside feeding captions into the adapter, we provide them separately to the text decoder in tokenized form (cf., Fig. 3); (iii) Prior to fine-tuning, we reset the decoder to its initial weights to overcome saturation, enabling us to fine-tune using the setup described in Sec. 4, which involves 5 epochs and learning rate of 5e5. Baselines In addition to the baselines in Tab. 2, which remain comparable, we also evaluate larger and commercial models that serve as stronger baselines (cf. Appendix B). Specifically, we assess GPT-4o [7], which has demonstrated strong performance in generating TikZ [3, 27, 29] and Qwen2.5 Coder (32B) [74] as an open-weights model. Results In Tab. 3 (Original Text), all fine-tuning setups of TikZero show considerable improvement over the base version. Approaches (i) and (ii) each enhance performance by over 30pp on AVG, while approach (iii) surpasses them with an improvement of over 70pp, positioning it as the best-performing model on average, even when compared to our new baselines, with GPT-4o being 8pp lower and Qwen2.5 Coder (32B) approximately 40pp lower. Approach (i) demonstrates that direct fine-tuning yields positive effects across nearly all metrics, notably improving MTE by 12pp, TED by 4pp, and KID by 3.5pp. Approach (ii) shows similar trends but, by also incorporating tokenized captions, further improves CLIPScore by 5pp, closing the gap to AutomaTikZv2 (LLM). Interestingly, both (i) and (ii) slightly decrease performance on cBLEU, potentially due to similar reasons discussed in Sec. 5.1. However, the same cannot be said for (iii), which not only achieves the highest score on cBLEU but also ranks as the second-best on TED, trailing only 0.5pp behind GPT-4o and showcasing that it is possible to perform well on both metrics. Additionally, it increases DreamSim by another 3pp and CLIPScore by 8.5pp, competing with the much stronger baselines Qwen2.5 Coder (32B) and GPT-4o. In KID, it even surpasses them by 3.5pp and 1pp, respectively. In summary, fine-tuning TikZero, especially when combined with separate caption input and weight resetting, greatly improves performance. This illustrates that the intersection of graphics programs and images with captions, though small, provides valuable training signal, and best performance can be achieved by making full use of both sets. The best-performing TikZero model even competes with and often surpasses Qwen2.5 Coder (32B) and GPT-4o on several key metrics. Notably, the former model is more than three times larger, and the latter is often estimated at around 1.8 trillion parameters [75], making it 180 times larger. 5.3. Human Evaluation To corroborate our findings from automatic evaluation, we conduct human annotation campaign focusing on two key properties: caption and image similarity. We employ BestWorst Scaling (BWS) [76], comparative annotation method that yields high-quality results even with few annotators [77, 78]. We sample 100 instances from our test set and present annotators with 𝑛-tuples of generated figures, asking them to identify the most and least similar figure to either the reference caption or reference image. This data is then transformed into scores from -1 (poor) to 1 (excellent) by subtracting the proportion of times figure is selected as the best from the proportion of times it is chosen as the worst [79]. For manageable workload, we focus on 𝑛 = 4 key models: TikZero (Cos), our best-performing model 6 tween TikZero+ and GPT-4o, appear more pronounced than observed with DreamSim. This discrepancy likely stems from BWS capturing relative preferences rather than absolute performance differences. GPT-4o is selected 20% more often as the best model than TikZero+, and AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) 15% more often as the worst model than TikZero (Cos), creating larger perceived gaps even when qualitative differences may be subtle. The SHR values of 0.68 for caption similarity and 0.76 for image similarity indicate moderate to strong inter-annotator agreement. We also observe correlation between these two tasks, with segment-level 𝜌 = 0.62 and system-level 𝜌 = 0.8, suggesting that both evaluation dimensions capture related aspects of model performance. GPT-4o emerges as the bestperforming model, aligning with its superior performance on the corresponding automatic metrics, CLIPScore and DSim. Among open-source models, TikZero+ performs best, while AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) ranks lowest overall. 6. Analysis We present comprehensive analysis, investigating the influence of typographic attacks on CLIPScore and examining the effectiveness of our architecture in low-resource settings, both in terms of training data and trainable parameters. 6.1. CLIPScore Limitations & Typographic Attacks known limitation of CLIPScore with text-rich images is its susceptibility to typographic attacks, where scores are disproportionately influenced by string similarity between images and captions [3, 80]. We suspect that token-conditioned models like AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) achieve higher CLIPScore values than models such as TikZero (Cos & MSE) primarily because they tend to visibly copy more substrings from the caption in the output image. To test this hypothesis, we apply the ROT13 substitution cipher [81] to all visible strings in the generated figures and recompute CLIPScore. This basic cipher replaces each letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet. While not cryptographically secure, the ratio between the original and recomputed CLIPScore values should indicate the influence of string matching, i.e., higher ratios suggest less copied text and vice versa. Tabs. 2 & 3 (Redacted Text) present the recomputed CLIPScore values and ratios for all evaluated models. The results reveal that most TikZero models, except for fine-tuning approaches (ii) and (iii), which also condition on tokenized captions, have considerably higher ratios (61%78%) compared to strictly token-conditioned models (34%51%), supporting our hypothesis. AutomaTikZ (13B) is an exception, possibly due to its initially low score. Further analysis shows that with redacted text, AutomaTikZv2 (LLM)s CLIPScore performance drops to the same level as TikZero (Cos & MSE), suggesting that string matching is the primary factor in its superior performance rather than producing better visuals Figure 4.

Along the diagonal, TikZero (Cos) achieves higher scores than AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), while TikZero+ and GPT-4o demonstrate superior performance compared to both. from Sec. 5.1; AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), its direct end-to-end trained competitor; GPT-4o, our strongest baseline; and TikZero (Cos) fine-tuned using approach (iii) from Sec. 5.2, our best model overall, henceforth referred to as TikZero+ for convenience. We engage thirteen annotators and obtain six fully annotated sets per task (cf. Appendix for more details). To assess annotator consistency, we calculate the split-half reliability (SHR) [78]. This method randomly divides all annotations into two sets, calculates scores independently, and then determines their correlation using Spearmans 𝜌. Results Fig. 4 presents kernel density estimates for the BWS scores, showing generally consistent rankings with automatic evaluations but revealing notable differences in the magnitude of gaps. For caption similarity, the ranking aligns with CLIPScore evaluations, with TikZero (Cos), AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), TikZero+, and GPT-4o achieving mean scores 𝜇 of -0.25, -0.18, 0.03, and 0.4, respectively. Interestingly, humans perceive 40% smaller gap between AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) and TikZero (Cos) than suggested by CLIPScore values, where AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) outperforms TikZero (Cos) by 50%. This indicates humans may evaluate caption similarity differently than CLIPScore (cf. Sec. 6.1). For image similarity, the system order remains consistent with our DreamSim metric, with AutomaTikZv2 (LLM), TikZero (Cos), TikZero+, and GPT-4o achieving 𝜇 of -0.26, -0.02, 0.01, and 0.27, respectively.

Nevertheless, reproducing strings is still somewhat desirable. The human oracle of our test set achieves ratio of 50.8%, close to the 47.5% of TikZero+, our best-performing model. In contrast, models like GPT-4o, with lower ratio of 41.9%, may overfit to caption copying, artificially inflating the CLIPScore values. 6.2. Low-Resource Training , 1 4 While our adapters train efficiently on large-scale datasets, we investigate whether such extensive data is necessary for optimal performance. Along the same vein, we examine the impact of reducing the amount of cross-attention layers inserted into the vision encoder. We retrain TikZero (Cos) using varying fractions of the training data (𝑑 {1, 1 , 1 8 }) and insert 2 cross-attention layers at different intervals (𝑖 {1, 2, 4, 8}). Table 4 presents the AVG scores from this parameter grid, with detailed scores in Appendix C. Our findings reveal that utilizing the full dataset and inserting cross-attention at every layer yields the highest average performance, highlighting the benefits of maximizing both variables. Interestingly, the models performance appears more robust to reduction in the number of layers compared to decrease in training data. For instance, training on only 1 8 th of the data leads to substantial performance drop of 36pp, whereas inserting cross-attention layers every 8 layers (resulting in only 3 cross-attention layers in total) causes more modest decline of 16pp. Minimizing both variables leads to the most severe drop of over 75pp. These results validate our training setup while suggesting that incorporating additional data might further enhance performance. Given that ArxivCap extracts figures from only 572k papers, whereas some corpora index over 200 million papers [82], there remains lot of potential for leveraging larger datasets in future work. 7. Conclusion In this work, we demonstrate the potential of TikZero and its variants for generating TikZ graphics programs from captions. Notably, TikZero does not require aligned caption-program pairs in its original formulation but instead aligns representation spaces of unaligned graphics programs and captioned images. This enables our model to leverage substantially more training data compared to end-to-end trained models that operate solely on caption-image pairs (cf. Fig. 2) while maintaining training efficiency. TikZero outperforms strong end-to-end trained baselines, including our independently trained AutomaTikZv2 models, which use the same data pool, excluding instances they cannot process, illustrating the strengths of our approach. When extending the TikZero approach with additional end-to-end training, it also compares favorably to much larger baselines and commercial systems like GPT-4o. While this enhanced approach, TikZero+, is no longer zero-shot by our definition, it remains TikZero model in the sense that it operates on both sets of graphics programs and captioned images, with the added advantage of explicitly utilizing their intersection (cf. Fig. 2). These results demonstrate the benefits of designing architectures around available data and validate the approach of decoupling graphics program generation from text understanding (with optional later reconciliation through TikZero+). Although we demonstrate our method specifically on TikZ, we believe its general principles will inspire future work on related graphics program synthesis tasks. Future Work Beyond scaling up our training data to explore convergence limits (cf. Sec. 6.2), we plan to investigate automatic methods for improving the quality and alignment of caption-image or caption-program pairs. This includes rewriting potentially noisy captions with LLMs and enhancing them with the visual understanding capabilities of VLMs [8385]. We believe our approach to aligning textual and image modalities enables other promising applications for graphics program synthesis, such as editing images in latent space via textual instructions to generate modified graphics programs. Additionally, we intend to explore alternative alignment strategies beyond model distillation, including contrastive learning [86], which has successfully aligned modalities in discriminative models [6, 87, 88]."

            "content": "Our evaluations include proprietary systems that operate as black boxes; their training data is unknown, and they offer no guarantees of consistent performance over time. This (i) makes addressing data leakage and cross-contamination impossible and (ii) limits the fairness and reproducibility of our experiments. Nevertheless, even under these unfavorable conditions, our open models remain competitive. Users should be aware, however, that our models may behave unpredictably, and outputs might differ from expectations. Additionally, our models do not include safeguards against potential misuse, e.g., for generating fake scientific content. Regarding licensing of our training data, large portion 8 of the TikZ programs in DaTikZv3 are licensed under permissive terms4 that allow redistribution. The remaining programs are distributed under the arXiv.org perpetual, nonexclusive license, which prohibits redistribution, which is why we exclude them from the public release of DaTikZv3. However, since we open-source our dataset creation scripts, we encourage others to reproduce the full version independently."

Supplementary Comparison with DeTikZify Tab. 5 shows in detail how TikZeros inverse graphics model (hereafter referred to as DeTikZifyv2) compares against DeTikZifyDS (7b), previously the best performing DeTikZify model, as evaluated on the test split of DaTikZv3 . DeTikZifyv2 clearly outperforms its predecessor across all evaluated metrics. Below, we briefly outline key differences in training and inference beyond what we described in Sec. 4. For comprehensive description of the foundation on which DeTikZifyv2 builds, we refer to Belouadi et al. [2]. Training Similar to DeTikZify, DeTikZifyv2 employs dense layer as the modality connector between the vision encoder and text decoder. However, for pretraining this layer, we replace the MetaFig dataset [2] with the substantially larger ArxivCap dataset, extracting 1 million (figure, caption, OCR) triplets. During fine-tuning, we randomly substitute inputs with synthetically generated sketches to support handdrawn inputs. To generate these sketches, we fine-tune the image-editing model UltraEdit [89] on dataset of real, human-created scientific sketches [2]. The resulting model, UltraSketch, achieves congruence coefficient (CC) [90] of 0.74 with said sketches, compared to 0.72 for the previous model used with DeTikZify. Additionally, we generate synthetic sketches using traditional image transformations such as random displacement fields. While these sketches exhibit less diversity, they better preserve text rendering and achieve comparable CC of 0.75. Averaging the sketch representations from both methods increases the CC to 0.82, demonstrating their complementary nature. Inference DeTikZify implements Monte Carlo Tree Search-based inference algorithm to iteratively refine outputs. As reward signal 𝑟, it computes the cosine similarity 𝑟cos = cos(pool(𝒙), pool( 𝒚)) between image patch embeddings 𝒙, 𝒚 of input images and compiled outputs via learned pooling function. Since DeTikZifyv2 fully fine-tunes the vision encoder and uses its patch embeddings directly, it cannot compute pooled embeddings in the same way. As an alternative, inspired by popular machine translation metrics [9194], we experiment with computing the Earth Movers Distance (EMD) [95, 96] with image patch embeddings. Given the distance matrix 𝑫, where 𝐷𝑖, 𝑗 = cos(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦 𝑗 ), EMD is defined as follows: When correlating reward scores computed as 𝑟cos from DeTikZify and 𝑟EMD = EMD(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦 𝑗 ) from DeTikZifyv2 with human judgments from Belouadi et al. [2], we find that 𝑟EMD enhances correlation with humans (0.456 segmentlevel and 0.911 system-level Spearmans 𝜌), compared to 𝑟cos (0.436 and 0.642, respectively). This demonstrates that DeTikZifyv2 not only supports the inference algorithm but improves upon DeTikZifys capabilities. B. Supplementary Inference Details To instruct general-purpose models to generate TikZ code, we employ consistent prompt across all models (GPT-4o, Qwen2.5 Coder (32B), and IDEFICS 3 (8B)) originally engineered by Zhang et al. [4]. For each figure, we replace the <caption> placeholder with the specific caption: 2 3 4 5 generate according Please scientific following figure requirements: <caption>. Your output should be in TikZ code. Do not include any text other than the TikZ code. the to C. Supplementary Experimental Results Tab. 6 presents detailed evaluation metrics scores for the low-resource training experiments discussed in Sec. 6.2. The results show consistent degradation in performance across all metrics as both the amount of training data and the number of layers decrease, trend effectively captured by the AVG scores also shown in Tab. 4. D. Annotator Demographics Our annotation team consists of thirteen experts with extensive research experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, or Computer Vision. The team includes one male faculty member, four female PhD students, four male PhD students, and four male researcher scientists from research institute. We deliberately selected expert annotators based on findings by Belouadi et al. [3], which demonstrated that crowd workers often lack the necessary research background to provide reliable annotations for scientific figures. To mitigate potential biases, each annotator received the tuples and items within the tuples in randomized order. EMD(𝒙, 𝒚) = , E.

The results show that AutomaTikZv2 (LLM) and TikZero (Cos) are more frequently selected as the worst models (four and three times, respectively), while TikZero+ and GPT-4o are more often chosen as the best models (both three times), which aligns with our findings in Sec. 5.3.
