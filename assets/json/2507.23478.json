Introduction 3D scene understanding is fundamental capability for intelligent systems, enabling wide range of applications in embodied AI, robotics, and mixed reality (Zhao et al. 2024; Song et al. 2025). The ability of an agent to perceive and reason about 3D environments is crucial for tasks such as robotic manipulation, navigation, and long-horizon planning. Similarly, context-aware augmented and virtual reality applications require rich semantic understanding of physical spaces to anchor virtual content and interactions in the real world. Furthermore, 3D scene understanding facilitates advanced spatial reasoning, such as interpreting spatial relations or inferring hidden object configurations, essential for agents to interact naturally with complex environments. Researchers have recently extended vision-language models into the 3D domain to tackle tasks like 3D scene dense captioning (3D-DC) (Chen et al. 2021a, 2023b, 2024b), 3D object captioning (Luo, Johnson, and Lee 2024), 3D question answering (3D-QA) (Azuma et al. 2022; Mo and Liu 2024), 3D dialogue (Chen et al. 2024a; Halacheva et al. 2025), 3D visual grounding (3D-VG) (Jia et al. 2024; Huang et al. 2024a), and 3D reasoning and planning (Halacheva et al. 2025; Chen et al. 2024a), as shown in Figure 1. Current approaches typically employ either end-toTable 1: Statistics of the public 3D-VL datasets that we draw on when synthesising the Scene-30K dataset. 3D Scene / Obj. give the number of reconstructed scenes and annotated objects respectively.

Despite this progress, current 3D vision language models still face significant limitations. One of the primary challenges is enabling models to reason about complex spatial relationships and dynamic scene contexts. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches often fail to effectively generalize across varied environments, as they are limited by the static nature of their training data and lack of adaptability. Another limitation is the reliance on pre-defined views or representations. Several pipelines assume fixed set of camera viewpoints or global panoramic scene encoding, which can introduce irrelevant visual content and still miss critical details occluded in those views. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI 2025) has successfully used reinforcement learning (RL) to induce large language models(LLMs) to autonomously emerge complex cognitive reasoning capabilities, begging our thinking to see whether we can leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning ability in 3D VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, foundation model to enhance reasoning capability in 3D scene understanding that integrates cold-start initialization with RL training. First, we synthesize high-quality 3D scene CoT dataset Scene-30K with diverse question types, as illustrated in Figure 2(b). Specifically, we design 3D VLM to generate concise textual description of scene. This description captures objects, their relations, and their layout. The resulting textual descriptions are then passed to reasoning model Gemini 2.5 Pro (Team et al. 2025) to produce highquality CoT reasoning. Finally, the dataset is refined through rule-based data filtering, ultimately obtaining dataset with 30K complex CoT reasoning samples, which serves as the cold-start initialization dataset for 3D-R1. Building on this foundation, we design GRPO-based RLHF policy in the reinforcement learning fine-tune process and introduce three reward functions: format reward, perception reward, and semantic similarity reward. This process focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities while maintaining detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic view selection method, guiding the model learns to assign ranking scores to candidate viewpoints of the 3D scene and dynamically select the most informative views. We conduct extensive experiments to enhance the capacities of reasoning within complex and diverse 3D environments. As shown in Figure 2(c), 3D-R1 achieves strong performance across various 3D scene tasks. The main contributions of this work are as follows: We introduce 3D-R1, pioneering 3D VLM that leverages cold-start initialization and RL training to enhance reasoning capability in 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we design RLHF policy based on GRPO, including format, perception and semantic similarity reward function to improve reasoning in complex 3D scenes. high-quality 30K scene CoT dataset is constructed to serve as cold-start initialization data for 3D VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic view selection strategy that enables the model to dynamically select views of 3D scene based on learned relevance scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 achieves an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks. Related Work 3D scene understanding. 3D scene understanding targets the comprehension of the semantic meaning of objects and their surrounding environment through the analysis of point clouds. In this study, we focus on several integral scene understanding tasks: 3D Scene Dense Captioning (3D-DC), 3D Object Captioning, 3D Question Answering (3D-QA), 3D Dialogue, 3D Visual Grounding (3D-VG), 3D Reasoning, and 3D Planning. 3D-DC involves producing descriptive language based on 3D environment, encompassing both individual objects and the entire scene. At the object level, models localize individual objects in point cloud and describe each with natural language. Scan2Cap (Chen et al. 2021a) first introduced this task by detecting objects in RGB-D scans and generating context-aware captions for each. Subsequent work shifted from two-stage detect-then-describe pipeline to an end-to-end transformer model. For example, Vote2Cap-DETR (Chen et al. 2023b) and its Vote2Cap-DETR++ (Chen et al. 2024b) variant use DETR-based encoderdecoder to jointly detect and caption objects in one pass. At the scene level, models generate holistic descriptions of entire environments. The recent 3D-CoCa framework (Huang et al. 2025a) integrated contrastive vision language pretraining with caption generation to produce semantically coherent scene descriptions (Huang et al. 2025b). Likewise, LLM-augmented methods, such as Figure 2: (a) Architecture. It takes text, multi-view images, 3D point clouds, and depth maps as input and formulates comprehensive 3D tasks as autoregressive sequence prediction. (b) Distribution of question types. Scene-30K contains diverse categories. (c) Multi-task performance. 3D-R1 demonstrates strong performance across various tasks. (d) Generalizability. 3D-R1 exhibits remarkable generalizability with enhanced reasoning capabilities. LSceneLLM (Zhi et al. 2024) incorporated global context and language priors and used an LLMs attention to focus on task-relevant areas and describe large cross-room scenes. 3D-QA extends the visual QA paradigm into 3D scenes, requiring spatial and cross-modal reasoning beyond 2D capabilities. The ScanQA (Azuma et al. 2022) benchmark introduced this task by pairing 3D indoor scans with questions. The follow-up work has increased the complexity, SQA3D (Ma et al. 2023), for example, situated an embodied agent in the scene and poses questions about the agents surroundings, testing the models ability to interpret the agents viewpoint and reason about spatial relations in the 3D environment. 3D-VG focuses on locating referred objects in 3D scene based on natural language expressions, requiring precise semantic and spatial alignment across modalities. Recent research advances have explored unified transformerbased architectures and LLM-enhanced grounding. 3DVGTrans (Lichen et al. 2021) proposed cross-modal transformer that fuses linguistic and point cloud level geometric features within transformer-based framework. Building on the capabilities of large language models, GPT4Scene (Qi et al. 2025) explored the zero-shot grounding setting. It integrated GPT-4 with 3D feature encoders via lightweight alignment module and prompted the LLM to resolve spatial references from language alone. Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have recently been introduced to further improve multimodal 3D reasoning. (Chen et al. 2025) proposed to compile scene graphs with RL-enhanced MLLM, in system called R1-SGG. They first train multimodal LLM to output structured scene graphs from images and then refine it via RL with graphcentric rewards that promote high recall and semantic alignment of predicted objects and relationships. In related vein, (Park et al. 2025) introduced DIP-R1, an RL-based framework that guides multimodal LLM to perform fine-grained visual inspection in complex scenes. These investigations showcase the potential of RL to improve 3D scene understanding in conjunction with large vision language models. 3D vision language models. Research on 3D visionlanguage models (3D-VLMs) has advanced rapidly, fueled by progress in large language models (LLMs). The early 3D-VLMs focused on understanding 3D object point clouds (Xu et al. 2024; Tang et al. 2024). PointLLM (Xu et al. 2024) introduced an initial 3D-VLM that couples point cloud encoder with an LLM, enabling the model to interpret colored object point clouds and answer questions about the shape and attributes of an object. Another line of work, MiniGPT-3D (Tang et al. 2024) proposed an efficient strategy to align 3D data with language models utilizing 2D vision language priors. More recently, researchers have shifted toward scenelevel 3D-VLMs that can handle entire rooms or complex scenes with many objects. For example, LLaVA-3D (Zhu et al. 2024) augmented image patches with 3D position embeddings and performs joint 2D-3D instruction tuning, enabling the model to understand whole scene and even output structured spatial information without relying on external detectors. recent work, 3D-LLaVA (Deng et al. 2025) takes complementary approach, using minimalist pointcloud-based pipeline with an integrated Omni Superpoint Transformer that acts as visual encoder and multi-task decoder; this module selects salient 3D features, embeds interactive visual prompts, and can output grounded 3D segmentation masks, all within single unified architecture.

Then based on the description, we apply Gemini 2.5 Pro to synthetic CoT data."

In the first phase, we synthesize the Scene-30K dataset, which pairs 3D scenes with questions and coherent chains of thought (CoT). In the second phase, we perform cold start with the Scene-30K dataset to teach the base 3D VLM shown in Figure 2(a) to reason in human-like fashion. Subsequently, as illustrated in Figure 4 we use RLHF policy such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and introduce two reward functions: perception reward and semantic similarity reward during the reinforcement learning training process to enhance the models reasoning capabilities. Finally, we introduce dynamic view selection method that scores multiple candidate views of each 3D scene and adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives to answer the questions, ensuring the model focuses on relevant spatial context."

            "title": "CoT Data Engine",
            "content": "We propose CoT data engine for the construction of Chains of Thought (CoT) (Wei et al. 2022) data tailored to 3D scene understanding. This engine leverages the general reasoning capabilities of the large language model (LLM) to answer the questions with coherent, high-quality Chains of Thought (CoT). As illustrated in Figure 3, the point cloud of 3D scene is fed into scene description generator, which is pretrained 3D VLM that produces concise textual summary of the scene. This summary captures objects, their relations, and their layout. Then we design comprehensive prompt that instructs Gemini 2.5 Pro (Team et al. 2025) to reason through the detailed logic structure to answer the question from the ScanQA (Azuma et al. 2022) dataset. The prompt provides clear task instructions, specifies the required output format, and includes the previously generated scene description, guiding the model to produce structured step-bystep CoT reasoning. Finally, the model outputs Chains of Thought (CoT) enclosed in <think> ... </think> tags, followed by the final answer in <answer> ... </answer> tags. By running this pipeline on tens of thousands of 3D scenes and questions, we collect roughly 35K CoT examples, each containing scene ID, question, and the machine-generated <think> rationale and <answer> output. Then these examples are refined through rulebased filtering process that eliminates responses with missing structure or inconsistent reasoning; for more details, please see Appendix. Finally, the 30K resulting examples constitute high-quality CoT reasoning dataset, which we call Scene-30K dataset that serves as the cold-start initialization dataset for 3D-R1. Cold Start Stage Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI 2025) in solving mathematical reasoning tasks through pure reinforcement learning, we first experiment with end-to-end RL training for our model, with the aim of inducing Chains of Thought (CoT) reasoning to answer the question solely from reward signals. However, this approach proves highly unstable in the 3D VLM base model: the model frequently fails to generate coherent CoT sequences and, more critically, produces answers that are semantically misaligned. scene, Chains of Thought To address the above issues, we adopt cold start stage based on supervised fine-tuning on the Scene-30K dataset. Leveraging the dataset, containing question reasoning pro- (CoT) of sequences, we cess, and corresponding final answer fine-tune the 3D vision language model to bootstrap its ability to generate structured outputs in the form <think>...</think><answer>...</answer>. This supervised initialization forces the model to learn the expected format for both the multistep reasoning process and the final answer, providing stable and effective foundation for subsequent policy optimization with reinforcement learning (RL). Reinforcement Learning GRPO (Shao et al. 2024) introduces an innovative approach rooted in reinforcement learning, showcasing impressive results in models such as DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek-AI 2025). Its main objective is to improve the models reasoning skills Figure 4: The pipeline of Reinforcement Learning based GRPO. The policy model generates outputs from point cloud and question. Then perception IoU, semantic CLIP-similarity, and format-adherence rewards are computed, grouped, and combined with KL term to frozen reference model to update the policy. by progressively improving its policy, using feedback from the precision of the responses sampled within group. 3DR1 decomposes the 3D scene understanding task into two distinct subtasks: scene perception and answer generation. It enables more focused learning and better generalization in complex 3D environments. Policy samples. For given input state (x, q), where is the visual encoding of the input point cloud and is the textual encoding of the question, 3D-R1 first generates distinct responses {o1, o1, , oN } from the current policy πθ. To better guide policy learning and improve alignment between textual prompts and generated answers, we introduce multi-reward mechanism. Format reward. To ensure that the content generated by the model has resolvable structure, we introduce Format Reward RF ormat. This reward detects the through regularization expressions whether generated results strictly follow the predefined format: <think>Reasoning</think><Answer>final answer</Answer>. The Format reward is defined as follows: RF ormat = (cid:26)1, 0, if Answer adheres to format otherwise . (1) Perception reward. The perception reward focuses on the core objective of 3D scene perception: accurately identifying where the relevant objects location is. It evaluates spatial precision by comparing the predicted bounding box with the ground-truth box using the intersection-overunion (IoU) metric. By optimizing Rp, the model is encouraged to generate spatially precise and semantically grounded predictions that directly generate the correct answer. The Perception reward is defined as Rp = IoU(b, b). (2) Semantic similarity reward. To encourage semantic coherence between the predicted answer ˆa and the groundtruth answer a, we adopt semantic similarity reward Rsimilarity. Specifically, we employ pre-trained text encoder CLIP to obtain feature representations of both answers. The reward is computed as the cosine similarity between their embeddings: Rsimilarity = CLIPtext(ˆa) CLIPtext(a) CLIPtext(ˆa)2 CLIPtext(a)2 . (3) Policy update. Inspired by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al. 2024), we select multiple responses from the current policy as candidate responses. Each output is assigned scalar reward, resulting in reward vector = {r1, r2, , rN }, computed by task-specific reward functions that evaluate the quality of each output. To assess the quality of each response relative to others, we normalize the rewards by computing the mean and standard deviation: ˆAi = ri mean(r) std(r) , (4) where ˆAi denotes the advantage of the i-th response. These advantages are then used to update the policy by maximizing Table 2: 3D scene dense captioning results on ScanRefer (Chen, Chang, and Nießner 2020) and Nr3D (Achlioptas et al. 2020). For fair comparison, we list methods that are trained under the standard per-word cross-entropy loss without additional 3D scenes. Our proposed 3D-R1 surpasses previous 3D specialists on both datasets.

            "content": "To bridge the gap between 3D scene representations and the 2D perspective inputs that VLMs expect, we introduce dynamical view selection module. The core idea is to automatically select set of informative 2D views from 3D scene that best convey the content of the scene to the visionlanguage model. Candidate view generation. For each 3D scene, we first generate pool of candidate views. We use the 3D point cloud to render RGB images from various viewpoints. In practice, we sample camera positions uniformly around the scene or at strategic locations to obtain diverse set of perspective images. Each candidate view is processed by pretrained visual encoder to extract features. This pre-trained model provides rich description of the view content without any additional 3D training, capitalizing on the learned 2D visual semantics. View scoring metrics. We design three complementary scoring functions to evaluate each candidate view with respect to given textual context. These scores are used to prioritize critical and diverse views. Specifically, for each scene and input text t, we calculate SText3D, SImage3D, and SCLIP as follows: SText3D(v, t) = Etext(t) E3D(v) Etext(t)2 E3D(v) SImage3D(v, t) = 1 I(t) (cid:88) iI(t) Eimg(i) E3D(v) Eimg(i) E3D(v) (6) Etxt SCLIP(v, t) = CLIP(R(v)) CLIP(R(v)) CLIP(t) Eimg Etxt (cid:13) (cid:13)Eimg (cid:13) CLIP(t) where Etext() denotes text encoder, Eimg() denotes image encoder, E3D() denotes point encoder, I(t) is the set of multi-view images of the scene, R(v) renders scene into 2D image, Etxt CLIP() are the text and image branches of CLIP, and is the Euclidean norm. CLIP() and Eimg (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) , Dynamic score fusion. The above scores are combined to produce an overall utility score for each view (v). Instead of manually tuning their relative importance, we dynamically learn the weight of these components. We introduce learnable parameters wt, wc, wclip for the text relevance, coverage, and CLIP alignment scores, respectively. This adaptive fusion ensures that (v) emphasizes the most useful views for each scenario. (v) is defined as follows: (v) = wtSText3D+wcSImage3D+wclipSCLIP, (7) where wc + wclip = 1, wt as an independent scalar. This allows the model to dynamically adjust the influence of textual grounding relative to visual signals. To stabilize training, we apply an L2 regularization term on wt, encouraging it to stay near target value (e.g., µ = 0.3), which prevents overly dominant text influence."

In downstream tasks, we incorporate standard benchmarks including ScanRefer (Chen, Chang, and Nießner 2020) and Nr3D (Achlioptas et al. 2020) dataset for 3D-DC and 3D-VG, Cap3D (Luo et al. 2023) for 3D object captioning, ScanQA (Azuma et al. 2022) dataset for 3D-QA , 3D-LLM (Hong et al. 2023) for 3D dialogue and planning and SQA3D (Ma et al. 2023) for 3D reasoning. Metrics. For 3D-VG task, we use metric Acc@sIoU, which reports grounding accuracy with different IoU scores between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. For the 3D object captioning task, we adopt both human and automated evaluation metrics. Human evaluation involves A/B testing to assess two key aspects: caption quality and hallucination rate, reporting average preference scores and win/loss rates. For automated evaluation, we follow CLIPbased retrieval metrics, including cosine similarity scores and retrieval precision (Poole et al. 2023) at top-1, top5 and top-10 (R@1, R@5, R@10). For 3D-DC, 3D-QA, 3D dialogue, 3D reasoning and 3D planning tasks, we use the metrics CIDEr (Vedantam, Zitnick, and Parikh 2015), BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie 2005) and ROUGE-L (Lin 2004), which are briefly denoted by C, B-4, and R, respectively, to evaluate the quality of the generated textual responses. Main Results We evaluate the models capacity to understand and reason in 3D environments via 3D-DC, 3D object captioning, 3DQA, 3D dialogue, 3D-VG, 3D reasoning, and 3D planning. 3D scene dense captioning. It demands model to localize and describe an object in 3D scene. We compare SOTA methods on the widely used ScanRefer (Chen, Chang, and Nießner 2020) and Nr3D (Achlioptas et al. 2020) benchmarks. The results in Table 2 show that our method consistently outperforms existing methods on both datasets. 3D object captioning. This task requires the model to describe localized object in 3D scene. We compare SOTA methods on Cap3D (Luo et al. 2023) benchmark. As shown in Table 4, Allviews 28-views indicates DiffuRank (Luo, Johnson, and Lee 2024) trained with all 28 views, Horizontal 6-views with 6 horizontal views, Bottom 6-views with 6 bottom views. The results show that 3D-R1 achieves the highest scores across all evaluation criteria. 3D question answering. It requires model to generate responses to the natural language queries questioning towards 3D scene. We compare SOTA methods on the ScanQA (Azuma et al. 2022) validation set as well as two test benchmarks in Table 3. The results show that our method consistently outperforms existing methods on all evaluation sets. 3D visual grounding. It requires model to accurately localize the object referenced by natural language expression within 3D scene. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on the widely used Nr3D (Achlioptas et al. 2020) and ScanRefer (Chen, Chang, and Nießner 2020) datasets as seen in Table 6. We can see that our method consistently outperforms existing methods on both datasets. 3D reasoning. It requires the model to infer spatial or functional relationships between objects based on contextual cues within 3D scene. We evaluate on the SQA3D (Ma et al. 2023) benchmark and report standard metrics in Table 5. The results show that 3D-R1 achieves the highest scores across all metrics. 3D dialogue. This task involves generating interactive context-aware responses grounded in the 3D scene. We compare our method on the 3D-LLM (Hong et al. 2023) dataset, as shown in Table 5. 3D-R1 significantly outperforms previous models, achieving state-of-the-art results across all evaluation metrics. 3D planning.

We evaluate on the 3D-LLM (Hong et al. 2023) dataset. As reported in Table 5, 3D-R1 surpasses all baselines across all evaluation criteria. Limitation and Future Work While 3D-R1 demonstrates strong reasoning performance and generalizability across diverse 3D scene understanding tasks, several limitations remain. First, although the Scene30K dataset provides high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, it is primarily synthetic and may not fully capture the diversity and ambiguity of real-world human reasoning. Second, the current GRPO-based RLHF optimization operates at the response level and lacks temporally grounded feedback. This limits the models ability to reason and act on long-range tasks in embodied settings. Third, our dynamic view selection strategy is designed for static scenes and assumes fixed pool of candidate views. This may restrict its applicability to real-time interactive environments. In future work, we plan to extend 3D-R1 in two key directions. First, we will explore embodied AI in real world application that integrates path planning and action prediction with multimodal reasoning. Second, we aim to build world model on top of 3D-R1, enabling agents to simulate and predict future scene states. Conclusion In this work, we propose 3D-R1, generalist 3D visionlanguage model designed to advance unified scene understanding. To address the shortcomings of existing 3DVLMs in reasoning generalization, we introduce Scene30K, large-scale, high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset that provides structured supervision for cold start initialization. Based on this foundation, we develop reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), integrating perception-based, semanticsbased, and format-based rewards to refine the models cognitive alignment and spatial precision. In addition, we present dynamic view selection strategy that learns to rank multiview images based on task relevance, spatial coverage, and cross-modal alignment. Extensive evaluations across seven representative 3D benchmarks demonstrate that 3DR1 achieves significant improvements over prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of combining structured CoT supervision, reward-driven policy optimization, and adaptive perception strategies for generalizable 3D scene understanding.

We conduct comprehensive ablation to examine the effect of each reward function in our GRPO-based reinforcement learning. As presented in Table 7, reinforcement learning (RL) yields substantial improvements in both reasoning and grounding performance compared to the baseline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Although SFT provides strong initialization, it lacks structural regularity, spatial alignment, and semantic fidelity. The format reward enforces syntactic consistency in the output, the perception reward enhances spatial grounding through improved object localization, and the semantic reward improves alignment with the intended meaning. When combined, these reward signals lead to significant performance increase, increasing ScanQA CIDEr from 97.95 to 106.45 and ScanRefer C@0.25 from 85.20 to 91.85. This highlights the complementary contributions of each reward component in optimizing the models 3D reasoning capabilities. Table 7: Ablation of individual and combined rewards in GRPO-based RL.

Dynamic view selection. To quantify the effect of dynamic view selection, we compare our learned strategy against three fixed-view baselines: (1) All-views, which uses all views of the scene; (2) Horizontal 6-views, comprising six front-facing views of the scene; and (3) Bottom 6-views, sampled from below the scene. In contrast, (4) Ours (Learned 6-view selection) adaptively selects the most informative six views based on learned utility scores. As shown in Table 8, our dynamic view selection strategy consistently outperforms fixed-view baselines. On the 3D object captioning task, it improves CLIP R@1 from 30.18 with fixed horizontal 6 views to 32.23, highlighting its ability to focus on more informative visual perspectives. Moreover, the performance gains observed on 3D visual grounding further demonstrate that adaptive view selection leads to more accurate object localization by providing contextually relevant observations. We also study the effect of three dynamic view selection weights, which control the fusion of three scoring cues: text relevance (wt), spatial coverage (wc), and CLIP-based similarity (wclip). Table 9 presents grid search for various weight combinations. The results show that all three cues are complementary: using any single score alone yields suboptiTable 8: Effect of dynamic view selection. Comparison of different view selection strategies for 3D object captioning (Cap3D) and 3D-VG (ScanRefer).

To further illustrate this, Figure 5 visualizes the performance landscape over different weight configurations. The plots reveal that moderate reliance on text grounding (wt 0.30.4) combined with balanced visual cues leads to optimal performance, validating the effectiveness of learned weight fusion. Architecture and hyperparameters. We conduct stepby-step ablation to quantify the contribution of each modality encoder in our unified 3D architecture. As shown in Table 10, we start from baseline model using only the text and image encoder, and progressively add the depth encoder and point cloud encoder. Each modality brings clear performance gains on both 3D reasoning (SQA3D) and 3D planning (3D-LLM) tasks. Adding the depth encoder improves performance on SQA3D, confirming that monocular geometric cues are helpful for grounding and planning. Further adding the point cloud encoder leads to larger gains, highlighting the importance of explicit 3D structure for complex reasoning. The full model (3D-R1) achieves the best performance across all metrics. Finally, we examine the impact of the LoRA rank δ, which controls the internal dimensionality of the adapter layers. higher rank allows for more expressive adaptation but increases the number of trainable parameters. As shown in Table 11, increasing δ from 4 to 12 results in significant performance gains across reasoning and grounding tasks, with ScanQA CIDEr improving from 94.57 to 106.45, and Nr3D accuracy rising from 63.12 to 68.80. However, the performance gains begin to saturate beyond δ = 12, as further increasing the rank to 32 yields only marginal improvements at the cost of higher parameter overhead. These results suggest Table 10: Incremental modality encoder ablation starting from Text & Image encoder. Performance is evaluated on 3D reasoning (SQA3D) and 3D planning (3D-LLM) tasks. The first row is the baseline, and each subsequent row adds one encoder. The final row (3D-R1) includes all modalities.

The model is asked to independently generate an answer ˆa. sample is retained only if the normalized Levenshtein similarity between ˆa and the content within the <answer></answer> tags, denoted as a, is at least 0.8. The similarity score is defined as: Similarity(ˆa, a) = 1 Dlev(ˆa, a) max(ˆa, a) , (8) where Dlev(ˆa, a) denotes the Levenshtein distance, and represents the character length of the string. If the score falls below 0.8, the sample is discarded, even if it satisfies the format and step-count criteria. The complete filtering procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1. After applying all filtering criteria, Scene-30K dataset is constituted and serves as the cold-start initialization for 3D-R1. Architecture. We construct the encoder and decoder the base VLM, Qwen2.5-VLcomponents on top of 7B-Instruct(Bai et al. 2025). We adopt SigLIP-2 (ViTL/14) (Tschannen et al. 2025), Depth-Anything v2 (ViTL/14) (Yang et al. 2024), and Point Transformer v3 (Wu et al. 2024) as image, depth and point cloud encoders, respectively. The output from each encoder is linearly projected to match the dimensionality of the text tokens and concatenated with them to form unified sequence. And we freeze the entire backbone, including the text encoder and decoder, and fine-tune only the 12-layer LoRA adapters, the image encoder, the point cloud encoder, the depth encoder, and the dense decoder. Figure 5: Performance surfaces under different dynamic view selection weight configurations. We analyze the influence of text relevance (wt), spatial coverage (wc), and CLIPbased similarity (wclip) on model performance, with the constraint wc +wclip = 1. Results on 3D-QA (ScanQA) and 3DVG (ScanRefer) reveal that optimal performance emerges when wt is within the range of 0.3 to 0.4, combined with balanced visual weights. that δ = 12 offers the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. Implementations Details Data synthesis. First, Scene-30K dataset is synthesized using Gemini-Pro (Team et al. 2025), producing 35,248 raw CoT reasoning examples. To ensure that only high-quality chains of thought (CoT) are retained, we design rule-based filtering that reduces the corpus to 30,012 examples. Some examples are visualized in Figure 6-10. the the that verify output filtering follows: We as follows proeach format: rule-based first required Specifically, cess is example <think>reasoning</think><answer>final answer</answer>. The <think> segment must contain at least 30 words, and the <answer> segment at least 20 words, to filter out overly brief reasoning and answers. Subsequently, we assess whether the <think></think> segment exhibits genuine multi-step reasoning, as opposed to single-step deduction. To ensure this, we mandate the presence of at least three explicit reasoning steps, identified through lexical cues such as Step n, First, Next or Last. Moreover, the final step must explicitly reference the target entity posed in the question (e.g., Conclusion: ...), as exemplified in Figure 610. Finally, we assess the logical consistency between the reasoning and the answer. Algorithm 1: Rule-based Filtering for Scene-30K Require: Raw CoT examples Draw = {(qi, ti, ai)}N Ensure: Filtered CoT dataset Dfinal 1: Dfinal 2: for all (q, t, a) in Draw do if format is invalid then 3: 4: 5: 6: end if if word count of < 30 or word count of < 20 then continue i=1 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: continue end if if number of reasoning steps in < 3 then continue end if if final step in does not mention target entity then continue end if Prompt Gemini 2.5 Pro with (t, q) to generate predicted answer ˆa Compute Levenshtein similarity score: = 1 egy applied during both training and inference. Given 3D scene with pool of multiview images, we extract visual features for each view using pretrained SigLIP-2 encoder. For each view, we compute three complementary scores, which are aggregated using learnable weights to derive final utility score. Following prior work (Luo, Johnson, and Lee 2024), we select the top-6 views ranked by this score and feed them into the model alongside corresponding depth inputs. All experiments are conducted on 4 NVIDIA H20 GPUs. Visualization To qualitatively assess the capabilities of 3D-R1 in various 3D scene understanding tasks, we provide visualizations in Figures 11-17. These examples highlight the reasoning ability of the model, spatial comprehension, and multimodal alignment. Dlev(ˆa,a) max(ˆa,a) if < 0.8 then continue 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: end for 22: return Dfinal end if Add (q, t, a) to Dfinal Parameter efficient tuning. To enable efficient finetuning, we inject LoRA adapters (Hu et al. 2022) into the last 8 transformer blocks of the base VLM, which comprises 28 transformer blocks. In each selected block, LoRA is implemented for all projection matrices in the VLM, i.e., (Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo) in attention modules and (Wgate, Wup, Wdown) in MLPs. Each adapter is configured with rank δ = 12, scaling factor α = 16, and no dropout, introducing only 12M additional trainable parameters, which account for approximately 0.17% of the full backbone. In total, 142M parameters are updated during training, compared to 7B in full fine-tuning, resulting in 98% reduction in the trainable parameters. Only these LoRA parameters, along with the image encoder, depth encoder, point cloud encoder, and the dense decoder are updated, while all remaining backbone weights are kept frozen. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on Scene-30K for 2 epochs with batch size of 12, adopting the AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 and cosine annealing learning rate schedule that decays from 105 to 106. Following supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we further optimize the model via reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The RL stage is performed for 2 epochs with batch size of 12, employing the Adam optimizer and fixed learning rate of 106. To ensure stability, KL divergence penalty with coefficient β = 0.02 is imposed between the current policy and the frozen SFT model. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic view selection strat-"

            "content": "<think> Step 1: Localize the queried table The question refers to the table, and the blue 3D bounding box highlights specific rectangular table placed in the classroom scene. Given the presence of seven tables, this selection implies that the referred table is either spatially unique, visually distinct, or structurally notable. Step 2: Analyze spatial context and adjacency This table is positioned near the wall and windows, suggesting it is in front or peripheral position relative to the rest of the layout. Step 3: Interpret table arrangement and visibility Its orientation is consistent with the row-style classroom layout. The surface color is darker than adjacent tables, possibly due to lighting, material, or rendering artifacts, which may imply distinct role or usage. Step 4: Evaluate its role and prominence Being placed near the windows and slightly apart from the central clutter of chairs suggests this table may be used by an instructor or for special functions. Conclusion: The table highlighted in blue box is rectangular classroom table, located near the wall and windows. It likely serves an active role in the classroom, possibly for instruction or individual work. </think> <answer> The table is rectangular classroom table, located near the wall and windows. </answer> Figure 8: Scene-30K CoT data example 3."

Step 2: Extract sofa-related descriptions from captions The sofa is referred to as dark colored two-seater futon.. Another line mentions ablack sofa. These two phrases strongly suggest that the sofa is likely dark, with black being probable color. Step 3: Examine object-level annotations Looking into the object annotations One mentions dark colored two-seater futon located by the door, Another describes black sofa located to the wall behind the fan. These consistently describe the sofa using the terms black, which suggests that the sofa appears consistently dark in the scene. Step 4: Check for contradictory evidence To ensure reliability, we examine whether any alternative colors are associated with the sofa. No such references are found, which strengthens the hypothesis that black is the intended color. Conclusion: The sofa is most likely black. </think> <answer> The sofa in the scene is black. </answer> Figure 9: Scene-30K CoT data example 4."

Step 2: Understand the scene layout According to the scene description, the setting is conference room, which contains: yellow table, chairs, cabinets, and whiteboard. The mention of whiteboard in the scene immediately suggests it could be candidate for wall-mounted item in directional context. Step 3: Cross-reference with caption information Scene captions state that the whiteboard is located next to the large table, and in one instance, it is said to be on the wall north of the yellow table. This direct mention supports the hypothesis that the whiteboard lies on the north wall, aligning with the spatial query. Step 4: Check for competing candidates There are mentions of cabinets and pictures, but their described positions place them near corners or above other objects, not clearly on the north wall relative to the yellow table. This strongly implies that the whiteboard is the only clearly described object positioned on the wall north of the yellow table. Conclusion: The object on the wall north of the yellow table is most likely whiteboard. </think> <answer> The object on the wall north of the yellow table is whiteboard. </answer> Figure 10: Scene-30K CoT data example 5.
