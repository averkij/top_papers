            "content": "In social psychology, compliance-gaining strategies are often characterized by manipulative communication styles designed to exploit targets cooperative intent to secure agreement and social alignment (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004). similar dynamic can be observed in productized large 1 Figure 1: We propose methodology based on factorial analysis to quantitatively diagnose how manipulative prompts exploit LLMs optimized for preference alignment, shifting responses from truth-oriented correction to user-appeasing agreement. Our analysis reveals truth-deference trade-off, demonstrating that advanced models may be more vulnerable to PreferenceUndermining Attacks (PUA). Tailored defenses are necessary to mitigate these vulnerabilities. language models (LLMs), which are trained and optimized under strategies that prioritize pleasing users and accommodating their preferences as primary reward signals, thereby orienting them toward securing positive user reactions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022). This structural similarity motivates us to repurpose the acronym in this paper as Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA): inferencetime prompting strategies that intentionally inject manipulative communicative-style cues while keeping the underlying task content fixed, with the goal of shifting model behavior from truth-oriented correction toward preference-appeasing compliance. Against this backdrop, natural question arises: when we interact with such models, does deliberately injecting PUA-style phrasing into prompts compromise the truthfulness of their responses? Which system objectives and which PUA-style dialogue factors drive these effects, and through what patterns of influence? Existing alignment and preference-optimization pipelines are widely used to improve model performance on preference-related metrics such as helpfulness, safety, and instruction or format adherence (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022). Empirical studies show that this training paradigm can induce sycophancy: when user inputs contain factual errors or explicit stancetaking, aligned models become more likely to echo the users position and less likely to maintain epistemic independence (Sharma et al., 2023; Fanous In parallel, work on jailbreak atet al., 2025). tacks studies inference-time prompts that bypass safety training and elicit harmful or disallowed content, often by appending automatically optimized suffixes or carefully engineered role-play instructions to user queries (Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). The Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA) build upon previous research on sycophancy, where aligned models prioritize user agreement over independent, truth-oriented responses. PUA further structures the mechanisms inducing sycophantic behavior into four orthogonal dimensions based on communication styles (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial), systematically naming this attack method. Unlike jailbreak attacks targeting safety violations, PUA focuses on benign tasks with verifiable answers, where the main failure mode is reduced factuality due to preference alignment pressure. Although some recent work examines how particular prompting styles or tones affect safety and factual accuracy (Dobariya and Kumar, 2025; Vinay et al., 2025; Rosen et al., 2025), to our knowledge there is still no study that, under fixed model and task set, jointly parameterizes system-level objectives and multi-dimensional PUA-style factors and uses factorial design to quantify their impact on both preferenceand truth-oriented metrics. To address this gap, we propose novel methodology that provides finer-grained and more interpretable analysis compared to traditional benchmark score-based evaluations, by treating both system-level objectives and PUA-style user prompts as explicit experimental factors in systematically controlled evaluation framework. At the system level, we construct two families of templates that make the models implicit objective either truthor preference-oriented. At the user level, we operationalize four PUA-style dialogue factors: directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, and reality denial. Each factor is toggled on or off in the user prompt. This yields 2 24 factorial design over prompt configurations, under which we assess how much the model is \"PUA-ed\" along two outcome dimensions: (i) deference, that is, how respectful and accommodating the models tone is toward the user, rated by an LLM-as-judge, and (ii) factuality, that is, objective truthfulness metrics. We instantiate this framework on set of open-source and closed-source LLMs across multiple sizes and evaluate their performance under different prompt configurations. Our results show that PUA-style prompting consistently increases deference and verbosity while reducing factual accuracy. Interestingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to these PUA effects. Additionally, open-source models exhibit greater susceptibility to manipulation compared to closedsource models. We release the full evaluation protocols and experimental results, along with sanitized prompt corpora, to support reproducibility and further analysis. In summary, this work makes the following contributions: Problem formalization and threat model. We define Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA) as inference-time, style-based prompt manipulations that preserve task content while steering aligned LLMs from truth-oriented correction toward preference-appeasing compliance, leading to reduction in factual reliability on benign tasks with verifiable answers. Factorial evaluation framework. We introduce reproducible 2 24 factorial design that varies (i) system-level objectives (truthoriented vs. appeasement-oriented) and (ii) four orthogonal user-level PUA dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial), offering finer-grained and more interpretable analysis than methods focusing solely on benchmark scores. This framework enables controlled estimation of main effects and interactions across models and inference modes. 2 Two-dimensional measurement protocol. We develop measurement protocol that operationalizes how strongly model is PUA-ed along two axes: deference (LLM-as-judge) and factuality (accuracy metrics), quantifying shifts in preference-facing behavior alongside epistemic degradation. Cross-model evidence. We apply the framework to multiple openand closed-source LLMs and show that PUA-style prompting increases deference and verbosity while reducing factual accuracy. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulation. Open-source models are more vulnerable than proprietary models. Reproducible artifacts. We release our evaluation code, aggregated results, and sanitized prompt corpora to support replication, ablation studies, and downstream analyses by the community, facilitating future benchmarking of PUA susceptibility in alignment and product-metric research."

            "content": "LLM evaluation has shifted from reporting benchmark scores to providing protocolized infrastructure that supports model comparison, iteration, and post-training feedback. major line of work focuses on objective knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and CMMLU (Li et al., 2024), offering scalable and reproducible measurements of factual and reasoning competence. Complementary efforts broaden coverage and metrics through large task collections and holistic suites (e.g., BIG-bench and HELM) to characterize capabilities beyond any single benchmark (Srivastava et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022). For open-ended assistants, preferenceand judge-based protocols (e.g., MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena) better reflect interactive usage while typically summarizing performance as aggregate scores or rankings (Zheng et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2024). Recent system perspectives further argue that evaluation should not be confined to isolated models, but should also account for coordinated behavior under hierarchical device-edge-cloud deployments and interaction constraints (An et al., 2025; Shao and Li, 2025). Motivated by this gap between measurement and explanation, we propose controlled factorial evaluation framework that estimates main and interaction effects of system objectives and userside manipulative factors, yielding fine-grained susceptibility profiles; such attribution at the singlemodel level is practical foundation for building explainable evaluations in collaborative settings. 2.2 Sycophancy under Preference Optimization Preference-oriented post-training optimizes models for user satisfaction (Schulman et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), but it can inadvertently favor agreement: when helpfulness is linked to satisfaction, stance-congruent responses are reinforced, while correction and uncertainty may be penalized. This leads to sycophancy, where models align with user beliefs despite conflicting evidence (Sharma et al., 2023). Stress tests like FlipFlop show that mild user pressure can induce accuracy-degrading reversals (Laban et al., 2024). Benchmarks now track truth drift and agreement-seeking behaviors under pressure (Liu et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2025; Fanous et al., 2025), while mitigation strategies focus on decoupling correctness from user-stance cues (Chen et al., 2024) and addressing sycophancy as reward design issue (Denison et al., 2024). These patterns have been observed in real-world deployments, prompting testing and monitoring (OpenAI, 2025). We build on this research by framing communicative style as the attack vector in Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA). Unlike prior work, we decompose sycophantic behavior into four orthogonal dimensions, naming this attack PUA. Our novel diagnostic methodology uses logical factor regression, providing more granular analysis than traditional benchmarks. We quantify the effects of PUA on deference and factuality, showing how communication styles systematically influence model behavior. 2."

            "content": "Jailbreak attacks and prompt injection aim to override safety alignment and elicit harmful or policyviolating outputs from ostensibly safe LLMs. Early systematic work such as (Wei et al., 2023) analyzes why safety-trained models remain vulnerable and proposes jailbreaks guided by failure modes of safety training, while fuzzing-style frameworks like GPTFuzz automatically mutate jailbreak templates for large-scale red teaming (Yu et al., 2023). More recent studies provide taxonomies and sur3 veys of adversarial attacks on LLMs and LLMbased agents, including jailbreak, prompt injection, and backdoor attacks, and situate them as inference-phase threats to LLM security (Xu and Parhi, 2025). Systematic evaluations of promptinjection and jailbreak strategies across commercial and open-source models further examine attack success patterns and mitigation layers (Pathade, 2025), and universal jailbreak backdoor work shows that alignment pipelines such as RLHF and DPO can themselves be subverted via poisoned or edited safety training (Baumann, 2024). Unlike jailbreaks that target safety-policy bypass, we study softer failure on benign, verifiable tasks: whether PUAstyle phrasing can make aligned models trade truthfulness for appeasement, characterized systematically via factorial design rather than isolated attack cases."

Each item consists of question qi, set of options {oi,1, . . . , oi,K}, and correct option index . We form the task input xi by combining qi and the options in fixed format, and then apply the factorial prompt design of 3.2. From each response Yi(S, D) we extract predicted option ˆai(S, D) using deterministic parser that maps the final answer segment to {1, . . . , K}. Item-wise factuality is then defined as Zi,fact(S, D) = I[ˆai(S, D) = ] {0, 1}. (8) We report average accuracy over items and analyse how it changes as function of and D."

            "content": "Main effects alone do not fully characterize steerability: the interaction terms βSk,j capture whether PUA factor becomes more (or less) influential under different system objective. We observe two qualitatively distinct regimes. Regime 1: near-additive behavior (weak interactions). For some models, the interaction terms are comparatively small or often non-significant, suggesting that the system objective and user-level PUA factors contribute approximately additively on the log-odds scale. This pattern is visible, for instance, in the open-source Qwen3 models for deference, where βSk,def values are close to zero and rarely significant  (Table 2)  . Regime 2: suppressive or amplifying interactions (structured moderation). Other models show pronounced, structured interactions. notable example is Gemini 2.5 Pro on deference: several interaction coefficients βSk,def are significantly negative  (Table 2)  , indicating that shifting the system objective can suppress the deferenceincreasing effect of certain PUA factors. On factuality, GPT-5 exhibits multiple significant negative interactions  (Table 1)  , consistent with the system objective modulating (and in some cases strengthening) the factuality-degrading influence of specific user-level manipulations."

Closed-source models are not uniformly harder to steer. Steerability is not monotonic in closed versus open status. GPT-5 shows large positive deference effects for multiple PUA factors  (Table 2)  , indicating high responsiveness to subtle user-side 7 (a) Factuality Effect Coefficients (b) Deference Effect Coefficients Figure 2: PUA factor main effects across models. Heatmap of main-effect coefficients (log-odds scale) The plot highlights (i) the strong and broadly consistent role of reality denial (D4) and (ii) model-specific sign patterns for secondary factors such as directive control (D1). steering signals. This suggests that production assistants, optimized for sensitivity to user intent and conversational nuance, may inadvertently enlarge the attack surface even in benign knowledge settings. Mild PUA cues can increase factuality in some closed-source models. Certain PUA dimensions, especially directive control (D1), are significantly positive for factuality in Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen3-Max  (Table 1)  . Thus, adding controlled directive segment can improve correctness for these models, even though D1 reduces factuality for GPT5 and the open-source Qwen3 family. plausible interpretation is that mild directive phrasing triggers stricter task-following and answer-format discipline in some production systems, improving multiple-choice performance. Suppressive interactions suggest implicit moderation mechanisms. Gemini 2.5 Pro exhibits significantly negative deference interactions  (Table 2)  , implying that the system objective can dampen the marginal effect of certain PUA factors. This goes beyond purely additive relation between appeasement and yielding, and is consistent with implicit moderation in which some objectives reduce yielding even under manipulative cues. Such interaction structure provides quantitative handle for diagnosing and comparing anti-steering behavior across model families."

            "title": "5 Conclusion",
            "content": "We propose 224 factorial analysis framework to quantify how system-level objectives and user-side PUA-style factors shape LLM behavior on knowledge tasks. Across models, we observe stable truth-deference tension: shifting the system objective toward appeasement systematically increases deference to an injected wrong hint while reducing factual accuracy. By decomposing outcomes into interpretable main and interaction effects, our framework moves beyond aggregate benchmark scores and yields actionable susceptibility profiles at the factor level. These diagnostics provide concrete alignment signals for post-training by identifying which factors dominate, how they interact with system objectives, and how different model families respond under controlled perturbations."

            "content": "Our current methodology is tailored to objectivestyle tasks with well-defined outcomes, and it does not yet capture the additional ambiguity introduced by open-ended tasks. Extending factorial diagnostics to open-ended settings will require more robust and reproducible outcome definitions (e.g., rubricbased judgments or pairwise preferences) to control evaluation noise and maintain comparability across prompt conditions. We view this as promising direction for future work, enabling factor-level analyses of broader real-world assistant behaviors."
