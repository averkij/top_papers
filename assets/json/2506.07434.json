            "content": "Scaling Law has boosted LLMs to handle more complex tasks with increasing model size, as well as the risk of generating offensive, false, or meaningless content, leaving the necessity to align the model with human preferences. Such alignment is often achieved through fine-tuning, which may lead to two issues: degradation in model performance on downstream tasks (Ouyang et al., 2022), and the huge computational overhead spent on fine-tuning. the alignment tax, i.e. Recently, low-resource LLM alignment has experienced fast development, which can be divided into two trends. Some methods directly interfere 1 Figure 1: Illustration of our motivation. (1) It is hard for base LLM (as the big bot) to directly align with human preferences. (2) However, small draft model (as the small bot) can guide the base LLM by providing wellaligned responses at the beginning. (3) This contributes to better alignment from beginning to end. with next-token decisions with external scoring during LLM decoding (Mudgal et al., 2024; Khanov et al., 2024). Despite certain effectiveness, they avoid improving the models inner alignment performance but reduce the coherence and fluency of generated text. The other trend is to influence the token distribution through in-context learning (ICL). For example, Lin et al. (2024) propose series of well-crafted contextual demonstrations to guide the LLMs to be more helpful. However, using the context to influence response generation corresponding to the current query is indirect, leaving much room for further improvement toward direct query-oriented solutions. With preliminary experiment (see Section 2.1), we observe that the alignment of large models is mainly hindered by its modeling the entire text space, where the well-aligned responses for one query are often not the highest-ranked one among all valid candidate decoding paths. However, once the large model has moved along the path of aligned response, the difficulty of generating the following content will be dramatically reduced. As the saying goes, \"Well begun is half done.\" These inspire us to focus on how to enable LLMs to overcome the obstacle of path selection for given query at the beginning of decoding, which has totally different motivation from the above two trends. In this paper, we propose novel framework for low-resource preference alignment, where the decoding is completed with the coordination of small draft model aligned with preference and large base model with strong capabilities, named Weak-to-Strong Decoding (WSD). Specifically, the draft model will provide well-aligned responses at the beginning of decoding, then switch to the base model to generate the rest based on welldesigned auto-switch mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 1. On the other hand, fine-tuning small models is feasible in low-resource settings, and can quickly improve its performance of preference alignment, which is opposite to the high computational cost of training large models. It also avoids increasing the time overhead, as the draft model can generate the same length of the beginning more quickly than the large model. We also collect new dataset, named GenerAlign, to train better draft model Pilot-3B, then test its collaborative performance with multiple large base models under the proposed WSD framework. Extensive experiments show that WSD is effective in enhancing the performance of the base LLMs under low-resource settings, outperforming all baseline methods. We also examine the impact of different hyperparameter settings and their intrinsic mechanisms. Moreover, unlike fine-tuning leading to the alignment tax, we find that WSD does not even impair the performance of the base model on downstream tasks. In summary, our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose novel framework, WSD, for lowresource preference alignment, which is able to enhance the alignment ability of base models without incurring large cost. 2) We collect new dataset, GenerAlign, to enhance the draft model on preference alignment, and test the performance of collaborations between the proposed Pilot-3B as the draft model and multiple large base models under WSD, which outperforms all baseline methods. 3) We examine WSD from different perspectives, even demonstrating that our method does not impair the models performance on downstream tasks, unlike fine-tuning.

            "content": "In this section, we propose our method, WSD, which aims to enhance the performance of base LLM in low-resource manner. 2.1 Well Begun is Half Done Given prompt x, the base LLM is often unable to directly generate corresponding response that is well-aligned with human preference. The difficulty lies in the fact that the base LLM models the whole text distribution, and multiple candidate responses can exist with different degrees of preference. Hence, well-aligned beginning can be crucial in guiding the model towards generating preferred output. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we conduct two-step preliminary experiment: 1) We sample 700+ prompts from GenerAlign, each paired with well-aligned response. The first 100 tokens of each response are retained as the aligned prefix. Then, we take the base LLMs to generate nine 100-token prefixes for each prompt additionally. Finally, we calculate the rank of each alignment prefix among all 10 prefixes based on the average perplexity of prefixes and the rewards1 of the full responses generated along with these prefixes, as shown in Figure 2(a). Obviously, the base LLMs struggle to generate such prefixes, as their perplexity rank is mediocre, while they are of great importance in guiding the model toward generating preferred output. 2) We explore the impact of the alignment prefix on the token distribution of the generated response. Here we calculate the mean perplexity of the next 1Reward values are provided by ArmoRM-Llama3-8Bv0.1 (Wang et al., 2024a). Figure 3: The illustration of the WSD framework. Given user query in (a), the draft model first proposes ym, which is then checked by the base model to determine the switch point, shown in (b). continues the generation in (c) to acquire the final response in (d). 50 tokens for each token in the aligned responses, as shown in Figure 2(b). It is observed that as more tokens are encoded, the base LLMs are affected by the alignment prefix, and the difficulty of generating aligned responses decreases. Especially, the most significant reduction in perplexity occurs at the beginning, further demonstrating the importance of well-aligned start. In summary, experiments here prove that reducing the difficulty with well-aligned tokens at the initial stage can be shortcut to aligning base LLM. As the saying goes, \"Well begun is half done.\" possibility of other paths for the base LLM , except for continuing to generate an aligned response: = (x) = [ym[: k]; (x, ym[: k])] ym = m(x) (1) (2) where is the final response returned to the user. represents the combination of models in WSD, ym[: k] denotes the first tokens generated by m, and (x, ym[: k]) is the continuation of the response generated by based on ym[: k]. 2.2 Weak-to-Strong Decoding 2.3 Model Switching Mechanism Fine-tuning has been widely verified to effectively adjust the model distribution to be aligned with human preference. However, the time and computational cost of directly fine-tuning large-scale model are enormous, making alignment fine-tuning difficult to afford. For small models, the cost of fine-tuning is acceptable, but the limited capacity of small models restricts their widespread use. Here we strike balance between the two sides. Building on the insights from the previous experiment, the base LLM has great potential to generate well-aligned responses if provided with well-aligned beginning, while how to acquire such beginning remains challenge. Therefore, we propose Weak-to-Strong Decoding (WSD), collaborative framework that leverages this insight to obtain balance between the above two sides. To be specific, for prompt x, we take smallsized aligned as draft model to provide the beginning of the response, which eliminates the Another important issue is how to determine the position of switching from the draft model to the base LLM . Since the token distribution of can be gradually adjusted by alignment prefixes, as shown in Figure 2(b), can check the beginning generated by and automatically switch to itself to continue inference when certain conditions are met. This process is similar to Speculative Decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), where the drafted beginning ym is first encoded by : PM (ym x) = (cid:89) i= PM (ym ym <i, x) (3) It represents the models confidence in ym. When the confidence first exceeds the threshold γ at the kth token, the distribution of has drifted enough to accept the tokens ym[: k]: = min{i PM (ym ym <i, x) γ} (4) 3 it with baselines at the aspect of human preference alignment, including HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), AlpacaEval 2 (Li et al., 2023), ArenaHard (Li et al., 2024b), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024a). We leverage Skywork-Reward-Llama-3.1-8B-v0.2 (Liu et al., 2024) to judge the win rate between the tested and reference responses for HH-RLHF, and judge models open-sourced by AllenAI for TruthfulQA. Moreover, from the perspective of alignment tax proposed in Ouyang et al. (2022), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) are considered to test the impact of the WSD framework on downstream tasks. Further details are provided in Appendix B. 3.2 Baselines In this work, we compare WSD with multiple lowresource alignment methods, including: Base represents requiring the base model to directly generate the response. Best-of-N represents the naive method that samples multiple candidate responses from the base model and selects the best one to return. Aligner is rephrasing LLM projecting raw responses to aligned ones, released by Ji et al. (2024). CARDS proposed by Li et al. (2024a) conducts rejection sampling on each segment of the response during generation, which is naturally split according to the uncertainty estimation of the base model. ARGS proposed by (Khanov et al., 2024) enables reward models to guide LLM decoding, which we implemented according to Li et al. (2024a). RE-Control is representation editing method inspired by reinforcement learning, where (Kong et al., 2024) design value head to control the tendency of hidden states during generation. URIAL relies on high-quality contexts customized by Lin et al. (2024) to shift the distribution of the base model in the generation process. 3.3 Implementation Details We leverage vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020) to implement WSD, as well as LlamaFactory (Zheng et al., 2024b) for fine-tuning. We implement Llama-3.1-70B (Dubey et al., 2024), and Gemma-2-27B (Gemma Team et al., 2024) as the base models, and Pilot-3B as the draft model for all experiments. The main hyperparameters are the window size and threshold γ, which are set to 6 and 0.8 by default, respectively. The total response length is set to 2048 for Figure 4: The illustrations of alignment tax in finetuning Llama-3.2-3B-it to Pilot-3B. The LC win-rate of AlpacaEval 2, representing its ability of preference alignment, exhibits clear increase, while its performance on mathematics and code (Accuracy of GSM8K and Pass@1 of HumanEval) has dropped. and the inference continues. However, the decoding distribution of LLMs always has fluctuations (Li et al., 2024a), making it fragile to make decisions based on the probability of single token. To enhance robustness, we smooth the probabilities within window of size w: = i1 (cid:89) j=iw PM (cid:0)ym j+1 ym j, x(cid:1) 1 (5) 2.4 Draft Model Training To verify the effectiveness of the WSD framework, we collect dataset, GenerAlign, used to acquire draft model with fine-tuning. Instead of including downstream tasks such as mathematics and coding, GenerAlign only focuses on the alignment of general human values, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty. We train Llama-3.2-3BInstruct on GenerAlign using DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024), named Pilot-3B, striking balance between excellence and accessibility for its small size. We conduct preliminary test on Pilot-3B with AlpacaEval 2, GSM8K, and HumanEval, focusing on preference alignment, mathematics, and code, respectively. The results are shown in Figure 3, where we also verify the existence of alignment tax, as Pilot-3B has degradation in the later two benchmarks. More information about GenerAlign can be found in Appendix A."

Table 1: Evaluation results for different models and methods across various benchmarks. AlpacaEval 2 and ArenaHard, and 512 for other benchmarks. We also set max length of 512 for the draft part by default. 3.4 Results on Preference Alignment Table 1 shows the evaluation results of different models and methods on various benchmarks. It can be observed that WSD achieves the best results on most columns, and the few exceptions are also close to the best results. This indicates that the WSD framework performs well on preference alignment with respect to the 3H principles (Harmlessness, Helpfulness, and Honesty). We also notice that Best-of-N performs surprisingly well, especially on MT-Bench. This is due to the base model itself having certain capabilities of multi-turn conversations, and the ArmoRM used in Best-of-N, as an excellent reward model, amplifies such ability. In general, methods that only rely on interfering decoding, such as CARDS and ARGS, fail to catch the performance of another group of methods that affect the distribution of the base model, such as in-context learning (URIAL), representation editModel Method GSM8K 4-shot Acc Humaneval Pass@1 Llama-3-70B Llama-3.1-70B Gemma-2-27B Base WSD Base WSD Base WSD 82.18 82.18 82.34 82.49 82.56 85. 54.27 56.10 51.83 53.05 62.80 65.85 Table 2: Results on downstream tasks from different base models, including normal decoding and WSD. ing (RE-Control), and prefix drafting with WSD. Aligner that has similar inspiration to the former methods, but directly transfers it to another form of distribution with response rewriting, also acquire considerable performance. 3.5 Results on Math & Code To detect whether WSD suffers from alignment tax like what is encountered by fine-tuning as in Figure 4, we test the performance of each base 5 Figure 5: Results of ablation study on Llama-3-70B. model on mathmatical and code-related tasks with the WSD, represented by GSM8K and HumanEval, respectively. The results are shown in Table 2. We surprisingly find that the performance on both two tasks not only avoids degradation but also achieves improvement. The main reason should be that although WSD shifts the token distribution of base models in decoding, it actually does not modify the model parameters. Therefore, the base models do not lose their original knowledge and capabilities, and thus do not suffer from alignment tax. Moreover, although Pilot-3B is not as powerful as the base model on these tasks, it seems to play role in quickly guiding the base model to the correct path to complete the task. We further discuss this in Section 3.6. 3.6 Ablation Study The core of WSD is to allow the draft model and the base model to better collaborate through the model switch mechanism. In this part, we control the behavior of switching by adjusting three hyperparameters: window size, threshold, and max draft length, to explore its impact. For window size and threshold, we set them to [1, 6, 12] and [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8], respectively, while the max draft length varies in [256, 512, 1024]. When one hyperparameter is adjusted, the other hyperparameters remain the default settings. We take the experiments on Llama-3-70B as an example and utilize AlpacaEval 2 and GSM8K as the evaluation benchmarks for preference alignment and downstream tasks, respectively. Results are illustrated in Figure 5. Along with the increase of window size and threshold γ, we find that the performance on AlpacaEval 2 improves dramatically, and the rising max draft length also has significant benefit within certain range, which gradually slows down. Considering the essence of these adjustments is making the condition of model switching Figure 6: Cummulative distribution of AlpacaEval 2 and GSM8K, along with increasing decoding steps on Llama-3-70B. Differently, more strict, gradually occupies larger proportion in the overall decoding. This is conducive for to better guide base models to aligned distributions, leading to better performance on preference alignment. Conversely, the effect of increasing max draft length tends to decline, indicating that the model switch is completed within certain range. the changes in performance on GSM8K are subtle, indicating that WSD is insensitive to these settings in downstream tasks. We further calculate the proportion of examples where the drafted parts have been accepted by Llama-370B at each decoding step under the default settings. It can be seen in Figure 6 that the proportion of GSM8K increases faster, and most examples complete the model switch in the early stage of decoding. In contrast, the proportion of AlpacaEval 2 completes the switch in later stage. This confirms our previous observation that for downstream tasks, the draft model guides the base model to the path of solving the problem, thus model switching can instantly be completed to enable the base model to exploit its intrinsic knowledge. However, it does not mean that setting the accept condition to be infinitely strict is the best choice, as it suggests that the draft model will be solely used from beginning to end, but empirically its 6 Figure 7: Evaluating the effect of different draft models. (a) Llama-3-70B; (b) Llama-3.1-70B; (c) Gemma-2-27B. GSM8K remain close, consistent with observations in Section 3.5. It suggests that WSD has certain robustness to the choice of draft model, maintaining stable performance on downstream tasks while showing positive correlation with draft model performance in preference alignment. However, it is not recommended to use particularly weak model to draft content for base models. For example, assuming it generates totally nonsensical output at first, the draft model will undoubtedly mislead base models. Therefore, careful consideration is required when selecting draft model, where Pilot-3B can be good choice. 3.8 Scalability of Model Capacity In this part, we verify the scalability of WSD on models of different sizes. We choose models of 2B-27B in the Gemma-2 series, as models of the same series generally have steadily improved performance in all aspects as the size increases. We investigate how their performance on preference alignment and downstream tasks will change under the WSD framework. The experimental results of AlpacaEval 2 and GSM8K are shown in Figure 8. First, as the model size increases, the performance of the model in both aspects, based on naive decoding, increases with the larger capacity. Overall, WSD has clear scalability with model capacity, since the performance improvement on AlpacaEval 2 is more significant under the WSD framework, while the change in scores on GSM8K is in parallel with normal decoding. Another interesting point is that the performance of preference alignment is related to both the base model and the draft model in WSD, as the improvement for each model is significant, and becomes larger with the increasing size of base models. Differently, the performance change on downstream tasks seems more related to base models, rather than clearly affected by the draft model. Figure 8: Scalability of WSD on models of different sizes in Gemma-2 series. (a) Results of AlpacaEval 2. (b) Results of GSM8K. small capability cannot handle the task as well as the base model. Moreover, setting larger max draft length can be beneficial for model switching, as it provides larger room for the draft model to prepare drafts while avoiding affecting the performance on downstream tasks. Another reason is that with more tokens coming from the draft model, the time consumption can be reduced, similar to what is pursued by Speculative Decoding. Results on other models are also consistent with the observation here, as shown in Appendix C. 3.7 Effect of Draft Models In WSD, draft model is crucial component that guides base models to generate content in preferred manner. To evaluate its impact, we compared Pilot-3B with various settings, including Llama3.2-3B-it as the draft model, as well as base generation without any draft model (as defined in Section 3.2). Results are presented in Figure 7. On AlpacaEval 2, generation with Pilot-3B performs clearly better than that with Llama-3.2-3Bit, which aligns with the superior performance of Pilot-3B in preference alignment over Llama-3.23B-it. Additionally, both of them contribute to higher scores in WSD, compared with base generation. However, performances of three settings on 7 Figure 9: Case study. (a) Model switching happens after the partial answer is drafted. (b) Model switching at the beginning of decoding.

For example, the performance of Pilot-3B on GSM8K (77.26) is much higher than Gemma-22B (33.59). However, when they collaborate, the performance of GSM8K has improved to 39.12 but is still far from Pilot-3B. This is contrary to an intuition that Pilot-3B may drive Gemma-2-2B to achieve extraordinary performance with its better capabilities. We also find it corresponds to the conclusion that the model switching will be completed at the early stage for downstream tasks, where Pilot3B only plays guiding role for base models. 3.9 Time Efficiency WSD uses the base model to continue decoding after checking the drafted beginning, which is generated by smaller draft model. This makes its time overhead theoretically not significantly increased compared to using the base model for normal decoding while improving the quality of the entire content. In this section, we compare the time efficiency of WSD and other baseline methods. All methods here are implemented using Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020) to ensure that other efficient tools (e.g. vLLM) do not have exceptional effects on the results. We randomly select 20 prompts from AlpacaEval 2 and let each method generate responses with the same maximum number of new tokens. We then record the average time per token for each method and calculate the ratio of the time per token of each method to that of the normal decoding. The results are shown in Table 3. We find that rejection-sampling-based methods, like ARGS and CARDS, have much higher time overhead because they require repeated inference to select and assemble segments, while the reward model selection and LLM generation cannot be parallelized. On the other hand, WSD has the lowest average overhead among all methods. Since the overhead of the draft model is much smaller than that of the base model, its impact on the total overhead can be negligible. In addition, the cache during the checking of base models can be reused to further accelerate the process. All these results demonstrate the practical value of WSD. 3.10 What Makes Confident in Checking? Due to the uncertainty when switching key points, as is discussed in Li et al. (2024a), the curve of smoothed probabilities is not always increasing but fluctuates. It raises question: what can be the key factor for the base model to be confident enough to accept the beginning content drafted by Pilot-3B? We randomly sample 100 responses of Llama-370B in AlpacaEval 2 and categorize them into three types: (1) switching in detailed answer (e.g. structured answer) (2) in the middle of analyzing the question, followed by detailed answer (3) other cases. The results show that the proportions of these three types are 57%, 33%, and 10%, respectively. We exhibit two cases in Figure 9 for the first two types, which account for 90% of sampled responses. In such scenarios where encounter segment, it becomes confident enough in the middle to accept the draft, as it can instantly learn helpful style to complete the task. The excellent performance of WSD highlights the significance of stylization in preference alignment, providing insight for future works."

            "content": "Most existing methods for preference alignment are based on fine-tuning, ranging from reinforcement learning to supervised methods (Gao et al., 2024), such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024), SimPO (Meng et al., 2024), MACPO (Lyu et al., 2024), etc. However, as the model size increases, the cost of such methods also increases, which is hard to afford. Recently, many works have attempted to achieve this goal in low-resource scenarios, from different perspectives. For example, Mudgal et al. (2024) and Khanov et al. (2024) take external scoring models to guide LLM decoding, while (Li et al., 2024a) split it into multiple segments, each of which comes from rejection sampling with scoring models. Another line is to indirectly influence the token distribution, such as in-context learning (Li et al., 2024c; Lin et al., 2024; Song et al., 2025). Differently, Kong et al. (2024) design value model to edit each hidden representation before token projection in LLMs, to shift it towards the given preference. Aligner (Ji et al., 2024) goes further by directly editing the decoded content to acquire highquality responses. The proposed WSD framework differs from these methods by first drafting wellaligned start directly for the query, then leveraging the autoregressive nature to influence the LLM token distribution to approach user preference."

            "title": "5 Conclusion",
            "content": "We propose WSD, novel framework improving LLM in preference alignment through lowresource way, where small aligned model first drafts well-aligned beginnings, followed by the base model to complete the rest, controlled by well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We then acquire Pilot-3B as with the proposed GenerAlign, boosting different large base models to outperform baselines, while avoiding the alignment tax on downstream tasks. Further experiments provide detailed evidence of the effect and intrinsic mechanisms of WSD. We hope all these efforts can provide comprehensive insights into WSD and inspire future research in this direction2."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "WSD demonstrates its value in enhancing the alignment ability of large language models in lowresource settings, but there are still some limitations left. First, we just use DPO to acquire Pilot-3B, which may not reach its performance limit. More settings of data preparation remain to be explored. The standard of model switching also remains large room to be customized. Second, we failed to implement WSD end-toend with efficient inference tools, like vLLM, due to the excessive complexity of such code. Third, there can be more alternatives to the way draft models are used in WSD. For example, implementing Speculative Decoding is promising choice, but it also has the disadvantage of being complex in implementation. We leave such possibility to future work."

For human preference alignment, the following datasets/benchmarks are used: HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022) is proposed to evaluate LLMs in harmlessness and helpfulness. We select 1300+ single-turn samples from its two test sets, Harmless-base and Helpful-base, for evaluation. The utilized metrics is win-rate of the tested model against the reference model, judged by the up-to-date reward model, Skywork-Reward-Llama-3.1-8B-v0.2 (Liu et al., 2024). TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) is widely used to evaluate the truthfulness and informativeness of contents generated by LLMs, where the scores of accuracy on these two axes are computed by two judge models 3 4 developed by AllenAI. AlpacaEval 2 (Li et al., 2023) contains 805 instructions from different sources, whose corresponding answers from the tested model are judged by GPT-4-turbo for the comparison with reference responses to compute win-rate and length-controlled (LC) win-rate. ArenaHard (Li et al., 2024b) is popular benchmark focusing on instruction following ability of LLMs. It leverage GPT-4-turbo to make judgments and calculate final scores. MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024a) is proposed to evaluate multi-turn dialogue capabilities of LLMs. The final score is the average of scores of each round provided by GPT-4. For the aspect of potential alignment, we focus on mathematics and code with the following datasets: 3https://huggingface.co/allenai/truthfulqa-truth-judge-llama2-7B 4https://huggingface.co/allenai/truthfulqa-info-judge-llama2-7B GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) is high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset to evaluate the ability of LLMs in solving grade-school-level mathematical problems. We set 4-shot as the evaluation setting and use Accuracy as the evaluation metric.

(The answer is California.) CARDS Aligner URIAL (No response is returned.) Georgia is the state that produces the most peaches in the United States. The state is known for its sweet, juicy peaches, which are grown in the warm, sunny climate of the southern United States. Georgias peach industry is major contributor to the states economy, and the state is home to many peach farms and orchards. The states peach production is concentrated in the central and southern regions of the state, where the climate is ideal for growing peaches. Georgias peach season typically runs from May to August, and the states peaches are known for their sweet, juicy flavor and firm texture. In addition to being major producer of peaches, Georgia is also known for its other agricultural products, including peanuts, pecans, and cotton. Hello! According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Georgia is the leading producer of peaches in the United States. The states warm climate and rich soil make it ideal for growing wide variety of fruits, including peaches. In 2021, Georgia produced over 80 million pounds of peaches, making it the top peach-producing state in the country. Other top peach-producing states include California, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Peaches are popular fruit in the United States, both for fresh consumption and for processing into products like jams, preserves, and juices. They are also key ingredient in many classic Southern dishes like peach cobbler and peach ice cream. Thanks for asking, and please let me know if you have any other questions! WSD juicy question! According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the top peach-producing state in the U.S. is: **California** Here are some stats to illustrate Californias dominance in peach production: * **Production Volume:** California produces approximately 55-60% of the United States total peach crop. * **Average Annual Production:** Around 2.5-3.0 billion pounds of peaches per year. * **Leading Peach Varieties:** California is known for growing wide range of peach varieties, including Bartlett, Crimson Lady, Red Haven, and Zee Lady. While other states like South Carolina, Georgia, and New Jersey also contribute significantly to the nations peach supply, California remains the undisputed leader in terms of both quantity and quality. So next time you bite into delicious peach, theres good chance it came from the Golden State! Table 7: Case demonstration from TruthfulQA, where Llama-3-70B is the base model."
