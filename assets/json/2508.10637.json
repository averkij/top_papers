Introduction Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations are not seen during training.

Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/ ryan-caesar-ramos/visual-encoder-traces *Equal contribution. Visual encoders are fundamental to computer vision algorithms, serving as the backbone for projecting images into meaningful representations. This core pipeline underpins various recognition tasks, from image classification [21, 35] and retrieval [34, 52] to object detection [55, 56] and segmentation [22, 33]. To ensure broad applicability in downstream tasks, visual encoders are typically pretrained on generic objectives such as supervised image classification [21, 67], self-supervised learning [6, 8], or contrastive vision-language training [53, 76]. Their primary goal is to capture the semantic content of images, encoding information about objects, attributes, and other relevant features. Given their central role in computer vision tasks, ensuring the robustness of visual encoders across diverse image distributions is crucial. This has led to extensive research on their sensitivity to various transformations and corruptions, including photometric and geometric changes [23], noise injection [23], natural corruptions [23], image compression [7, 17], adversarial perturbations [18, 36] and examples [25], and out-of-distribution inputs such as stylized images [16] or samples from unseen datasets [25]. This work investigates robustness in the era of foundation models, which are typically kept frozen after large1 scale pretraining to preserve their acquired knowledge. However, this practice also preserves any inherent sensitivities or irregularities in their representation spaces. Our study differs from prior work in several key aspects: 1. We examine not only image-processing variations but also acquisition-related factors. We categorize these into two types: image processing parameters, which stem from standard preprocessing and encoding techniques, and image acquisition parameters, which originate from camera settings at capturing time. Therefore, images carry not only their semantic labels but also metadata labels that reflect the values of these acquisition and processing parameters. 2. While existing robustness studies primarily focus on severe corruptions and transformations that degrade the semantic signal, we investigate subtle variations that are often imperceptible to the human eye. 3. Prior work typically assumes clean image state during training and evaluates robustness under test-time distribution shifts involving uncommon or degraded states. In contrast, we consider continuum of valid states, characterized by metadata labels, emphasizing the interplay between the prior distribution of semantic and metadata labels, key aspect of our findings. To clarify these issues, we address the following questions: How do metadata labels influence the representations generated by visual encoders? and Do metadata labels affect the quality of downstream task predictions? Our analysis spans diverse range of visual encoders, covering different architectures, model sizes, training objectives, and datasets. Key findings include: 1. Acquisition and processing parameters leave identifiable traces in many models representation spaces. Such traces allow the inversion, i.e. prediction, of the original input images parameters with considerably higher accuracy than random chance. 2. These traces can overshadow semantic content in downstream tasks, leading to biases where model predictions are influenced by the acquisition or processing parameters rather than the actual object semantics (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, we find that similarity in the representation space depends on both semantic and metadata labels (see Fig. 2), with the latter often having disruptive influence in downstream tasks. 3. We identify contrastive vision-language models as the most sensitive to such influences, and our experiments suggest that this sensitivity stems from the absence of strong image augmentations during pretraining. same semantic, same metadata same semantic, diff metadata diff semantic, same metadata diff semantic, diff metadata 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 similarity to the query image Figure 2. Distribution of similarities with respect to query image. Four distributions are shown, based on whether the semantic and metadata labels of the images match those of the query. Metadata labels are based on JPEG quality. The results highlight that similarity is influenced by both types of labels. 2. Preliminaries Visual encoders We analyze 47 visual encoders, each used to extract image embeddings without any further finetuning. We categorize them into three groups according to their training schemes: Supervised (SUP) are models trained with supervision for image classification on ImageNet [57]. Several variants of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer architectures are considered, including ResNet [21], ConvNeXt [42], and ViT [12]. Self-supervised learning (SSL) are models trained with contrastive learning. Several variants of DINO [6], DINOv2 [50], and MoCov3 [9] are considered. Contrastive visual-language (CVL) are models trained for vision-language alignment. We use several variants of CLIP [53], OpenCLIP [10], and SigLIP [71, 76]. The full list of visual encoders and their settings can be found in the supplementary material. Image processing parameters are the properties of an image that are not determined at the time of capture and that can be changed in post-processing stages. These include image compression (e.g. JPEG quality), color-based transformations (e.g. sharpening), image resizing (e.g. type of interpolation), etc. We use the notation = {p1, , pM } to indicate the possible classes for one of four processing parameters: JPEG compression, sharpening, amount of resizing, and resize interpolation. These findings raise concerns about model reliability, especially in corner cases that, while artificially injected to our experiments, may occur in real-world applications. Image acquisition parameters are the properties of an image that are determined by the method of its capture. These include specification of the camera (e.g. camera 2 Table 1.

Tab. 1 shows the list of parameters under analysis. More details are provided in the supplementary material. Datasets Image processing parameters can be controlled and adjusted as desired, allowing us to study them on any existing dataset.1 We use two common image classification datasets that carry semantic labels: ImageNet [57] and iNaturalist 2018 [27, 28], following the default splits into training (Xtrain) and test (Xtest) sets. In contrast, image acquisition parameters are fixed once an image is captured. They can typically be recovered from the images Exif tags, which most datasets do not include. We collect and make available two new datasets: FlickrExif and PairCams. FlickrExif: We use the Flickr API2 to download images and their accompanying Exif metadata. For each month from January 2000 to August 2024, we collect between 2, 000 and 4, 000 safe-for-work photos with permissive licenses. To prevent the dataset from being dominated by small group of prolific photographers, we limit the number of images contributed by each user to 10 per month and year. This leads to total of 356, 459 images. PairCams: To ensure complete control over the data and eliminate potential semantic confounders, we manually collect dataset with 730 pairs of photos, totaling 1, 460 images. Each pair depicts the same object or scene captured under identical conditions but different camera types. Specifically, we use two distinct categories of cameras: (i) modern smartphones, and (ii) older digital cam1Images in existing datasets are already processed, so our processing is applied on top of any prior one. 2https://www.flickr.com/services/api/ Figure 3.

Processing and acquisition traces We examine whether visual encoders retain traces of image processing and acquisition parameters. classifier is trained to predict the metadata labels. If its performance is close to random accuracy, it indicates that the embeddings do not encode information related to processing or acquisition parameters. If the classifier performs better than random chance, it shows that information about these parameters is indeed encoded within the embeddings. 3.1. Prediction of processing-based labels Setup Given training set Xtrain and test set Xtest, we process every training image Xtrain with px Uniform(P), where Uniform(P) is the uniform distribution over P, while we process all test images using pi P. More specifically, we make sets Dtrain = {(x, px)x Xtrain, px Uniform(P)} and Dtest(pi) = {(x, pi)x Xtest} for given pi. We then train linear classifier to predict the metadata label. We use 20% of the training set as the validation set to select the best learning rate and weight de3All smartphones in PairCams were released in 2018 or later.

We report the classification accuracy on the test set averaged over every possible choice of pi, as well as across 10 different seeds that control the sampling of px.5 Results Fig. 4 shows the linear classification accuracy for predicting processing-based labels. We observe that CVL models, compared to other types of models, show higher ability to recognize all processing-based labels; e.g. CVL models are capable of exceeding 80% accuracy for predicting JPEG compression, sharpening, and resizing on ImageNet. Specifically, one version of CVL model based on ConvNeXt performs the best for all processing types. Additionally, many supervised models, mostly based on ConvNeXt, also obtain high performance. On the other hand, self-supervised models generally perform the worst on all processing parameters. Regarding different processing types, predicting interpolation is the hardest across all model types. However, the best performing CVL and supervised models still perform well above the random accuracy of 25% on both datasets. 3.2. Prediction of acquisition-based labels Setup For each acquisition parameter A, we create training set Xtrain and test set Xtest. Except for model (all) and model (smart), we only use values of with at least 5, 000 images. From these, we randomly select 500 images for the test set.

Fig. 5 shows the ImageNet validation accuracy for multiple visual encoders when images are center-masked at ratios from 0 to 100%. We find that 90% masking ratio is sufficient to eliminate the semantic signal from images, as all visual encoders accuracies drop to nearly random. Results Fig. 6 illustrates prediction accuracies for acquisition-based labels on the FlickrExif test sets. Even with 90% masking, some visual encoders, particularly supervised ConvNeXts and most CVLs except SigLIP, predict acquisition parameters well above random chance. The rest of the supervised encoders, SigLIP, and SSLs do not recover such information to the same extent, leading to lower prediction rates. The majority of CVLs excel, with most exceeding 70% accuracy for model (smart vs nonsmart) against baseline of 50%.

The highest rates are from CVLs, which range from 58.6% to 70.1% compared to at most 58.0% from non-CVLs. The implication is that while visual encoders are storing model information in their embeddings, this trend is strongest among CVLs. This is visualized in the t-SNE [72] representations in Fig. 7, which shows how the most and the least discriminative encoders in Tab. 2 distribute images in their embedding spaces. While CLIP, CVL model, shows areas of high concentration of images of similar model (smart vs non-smart), ViT, supervised model, shows much more even mix of points. This trend is further supported in Sec. 4. 4. Effect of traces on downstream tasks While we have shown that metadata labels can be predicted from image embeddings, in this section, we investigate whether this information can impact downstream applications that rely on the ability to predict semantic labels.

Processing distracts semantic predictions To analyze the impact of processing parameters on semantic predictions, we use kNN classifier to predict the semantic label of each image. In that way, we assess the representation capability of the models to bring closer images with the same semantic label. Setup Given training set Xtrain and test set Xtest, the same as in Sec. 3.1, we measure the classification accuracy of predicting the semantic label. We perform this in five setups, where separate training set is formed per test image. (i) All-same (baseline): processing all training Xtrain and test Xtest images with an identical processing value pi. It serves as baseline for reference, where classification performance is fully determined by the semantic similarity between image embeddings. (ii) All-diff: processing all training Xtrain images with processing value pj and test Xtest images with processing value pi, for = j. It reflects the common setup of existing robustness studies [23]. (iii) Pos-same: processing test image Xtest and training images that share the same semantic label (positive) as with pi, while processing training images that have different semantic label (negative) with processing value pj with = j. It investigates whether semantic positives (negatives) being metadata positives (negatives) affects the accuracy, compared to the baseline. (iv) Neg-same: processing test image Xtest and training images that do not have the same semantic label (negative) as with pi, while processing training images that have the same semantic label (positive) as with processing value pj with = j. It investigates whether semantic positives (negatives) being metadata negatives (positives) affects the accuracy, compared to the baseline. (v) Uniform: similarly to Sec. 3.1, processing Xtest with pi while Xtrain is processed with px Uniform(P). This reflects more realistic scenario. We report classification accuracy averaged across all possible combinations of pi and pj for each setup, as well as for 10 random seeds for uniform sampling of px. Results Fig. 8 illustrates the impact of metadata labels related to processing parameters on semantic recognition. When semantic and metadata labels are coupled and change together (pos-same, neg-same), performance is significantly affected for certain processing types and models. Although these setups are extreme, they represent corner cases that could still arise in real-world scenarios for specific test image. JPEG compression has the greatest impact, followed by sharpening and resizing. Interpolation mostly has an insignificant effect on semantics. The followed by greatest sensitivity is observed in CVLs, some supervised models, mainly the ones based on the ConvNeXt architecture. Self-supervised models are the least affected, providing hints on heavy geometric and photometric training augmentations causing the different behavior. The all-diff and uniform setups perform similarly, typically slightly below the baseline. This suggests that prec@10 = 40% prec@10 = 80% prec@10 = 20% Figure 9.

We visualize the top-10 nearest neighbors of query image in three different setups in Fig. 9 for one of the most impacted models, i.e. the CVL ConvNeXt-L model. The traces of metadata labels in the representation space significantly affect the quality of the nearest images. Evidently, distance in the representation space is function of both semantic and metadata labels for some foundation models. 1 ) r i ( 1 @ c 0.95 0. 0.85 4.2.

Setup Given query image of an object or scene captured by one camera type, the objective is to retrieve the corresponding image of the same object or scene (positive) taken by different camera type. We consider two different settings for the negative images in the retrieval database: (i) same negatives are captured by the same camera type as the query, or (ii) different negatives are captured by different camera type. We evaluate performance based on the average recall@1 under both settings. Results Results are presented in Fig. 10. All points are above the diagonal, suggesting the influence of the metadata label on the retrieval performance.

Related work Robustness benchmarks and mitigation There has been much effort on the improvement of visual encoders robustness under shifts from their training distributions. This includes the design of benchmarks that evaluate robustness on hard conditions [1, 16, 2325, 39], with some specializing on corruptions and perturbations [23], stylization techniques [16], JPEG compressions [17], adversarial and outof-distribution examples [25], attribute editing [39], and environment and sensor shifts [1]. Other work focuses specifically on CVL models under similar conditions i.e. adversarial examples [46], perturbations [62], JPEG compression [7], and multiple aspects of robustness simultaneously [40]. Additionally, several solutions for improving robust7 ness, involving the use of strong augmentations [16, 23], more elaborate training process [79], learning artifact correction [14], test-time adaptation [64] and training [51, 74], or prompting [38] and adversarial fine-tuning [63], have been shown to improve CVL zero-shot performance. Unlike prior work, we analyze images processing and acquisition attributes and the ability of pretrained models to capture such information. We show that such signals can dominate representations and distract semantics, even though they are imperceptible to the naked eye. Also, we do not consider training images derived from clean in-domain distribution since all images carry their unique processing and acquisition attributes, with only small fraction being controllable (e.g., JPEG compression). Analysis of visual encoder robustness Analyzing the behavior of visual encoders, Goodfellow et al. [18] investigate the impact of inserting human-imperceptible noise into test images during evaluation. It is found that by altering just one pixel, model predictions can be changed [69]. Other analysis involve texture-shape bias [16], translation/shift invariance and positional encoding [29, 30, 77], comparison between architecture families [48], or emergent properties from large-scale pretraining [66]. Closely related to our work is model performance assessment under different JPEG compression [7, 14], while recent work [19] highlights that discrepancies in JPEG compression can affect performance evaluation, resulting in misleading outcomes. Attribute detection Similar to our experiments on metadata label prediction, previous work has explored attribute prediction tasks, such as camera model identification [4, 45, 54] or camera parameters prediction (e.g. focal length and radial distortion [73] or camera tilt and roll [43]). There is also work on aligning Exif tags with visual content via CVLs [78], as well as predicting image compression [13] and coding [37]. While our experiments share clear similarities, this typically involves training models with supervised labels to predict image attributes. In contrast, we reveal that this type of information is already contained in the visual representations, which can predict the processing and acquisition attributes without any further training or fine-tuning. Visual bias Prior work [41, 70] has shown that datasetspecific biases allow classifier to predict an images dataset of origin well above random. To combat such kinds of biases, several methods for debiasing at training time have been proposed, like leveraging labels of attributes introducing bias [3, 26, 31, 58, 75] or pseudo-labels derived from the biased classifiers [2, 5, 47, 60]. More recent approaches employ external models to discover and then suppress biases by extracting common textual keywords from misclassified examples [32], or directly using large language models for bias discovery [11, 20, 61]. Our evaluation setup for analyzing the impact of metadata labels on semantic prediction shares similarities with approaches in this field [2, 26, 58]. 6. Discussion and conclusion Conclusions We have shown that metadata labels, such as acquisition and processing parameters, are encoded in the representations of foundational visual encoders, especially those trained with CVL loss. Our analysis revealed that traces of such labels can impact semantic recognition performance, depending on the relative distribution between semantic and metadata labels. This effect, however, is not uniform across all models: it is most pronounced in CVLs, while SSL encoders exhibit it to lesser extent. This discrepancy may be attributed to the drastic pixel-wise and geometric augmentations in SSL, which CVLs do not employ. To verify this assumption, in Appendix A, we train from scratch and finetune CVL model with and without augmentations. We show that the introduction of augmentations reduces the metadata information encoded in the representations. Limitations While we have identified that metadata labels are encoded in foundational visual encoders and provided hints about potential causes, we cannot definitively pinpoint the source of the problem. Investigating this further is challenging due to the cost of retraining such models and the frequent use of private datasets and undisclosed implementation details. Although we do not propose specific mitigation techniques, we highlight the issue as an important area for future research. Negative implications Metadata labels leaving traces in visual encoders to the point of overshadowing semantic information can lead to unpredictable outcomes, compromising generalizability, robustness, and potentially undermining the trustworthiness of the models. More critically, this effect could be exploited maliciously; for instance, an adversarial attack may manipulate metadata to intentionally mislead or deceive model, posing risks in sensitive domains like healthcare, surveillance, or autonomous systems. Positive implications There are some applications that can benefit from the implications revealed in this work. For example, recent methods for synthetic (deepfake) image detection leverage frozen CVL models for detection [49, 65] and localization [68]. Interestingly, CVL models can be used as kNN classifier, i.e. without training linear classifier [49]. We presume that the capability of CVL models to detect deepfakes shares the same underlying root enabling attribute-based detection."

            "content": "A. Impact of augmentations on encoding of metadata in CVLs To verify our assumption that one of the main reasons that SSL models generally encode less metadata information is the use of heavy augmentations, we train CVL model using OpenCLIP [10] both without heavy augmentation (default OpenCLIP setup) and with DINOv2 [50] style color augmentations.6 We train ViT-B/32 CVL model both from scratch and finetuned from the LAION-2B checkpoint on the YFCC15M dataset [53]. We follow the default training hyperparameters from OpenCLIP, which is training for 32 epochs with batch size of 32k using the AdamW [44] optimizer. We utilize the cosine scheduler with warmup of 2, 000 iterations. Learning rate is set to 5e4 and weight decay is equal to 0.2. Fig. and Fig. present the results for processingbased and acquisition-based metadata label prediction, respectively. Augmentations greatly reduce the accuracy of processing-based metadata label prediction. We observe similar trend for acquisition-based metadata labels, though not to the same extent and consistency. Fig. presents the results for the effects of processing on the downstream tasks. Augmentations greatly reduce the influence of processing parameters on the prediction of semantics. Although these results point to the lack of heavy augmentations in CVLs as one of the main reasons for their strong encoding of metadata information, further investigation is still necessary, as some CVL models, like SigLIP [76], encode less metadata information, although they do not employ heavy augmentations. B. Parameters description We consider the following processing and acquisition parameters. JPEG compression is one of the most common operations that will be applied to an image after its acquisition. JPEG applies lossy compression where the amount of compression can be controlled by the quality and chroma-subsampling parameters. To investigate the influence of JPEG compression on image representations, we recompress images using quality {75, 85, 95} and chroma-subsampling {4:2:0, 4:4:4}, which gives = 6 possible processing parameter values. Sharpening corrects pixel values such that the image appears sharper, and is commonly automatically applied by different services [15]. We use unsharp mask based sharpening of an image given as sharp(I) = αI + (1 α)blur(I) where α controls the sharpness of the image. α = 1 gives the original image, while α > 1 gives sharper image. For we consider set of processing parameter values given when α {1, 2, 4}. Resizing is common operation applied to images, after their acquisition, that changes the dimension of the image. To evaluate the influence of resizing, we set processing parameter values as = {1x, 0.5x, 2x} that define original image, image where both width and height are halved, and image where both width and height are doubled, respectively. We use bilinear interpolation. Interpolation defines the interpolation function used during image resizing. To evaluate the influence of interpolation function, we set processing parameter values as = {bilinear, bicubic, lanczos, box}, and we resize each image by changing its both sides by r% where Uniform[20, 20]. Make refers to the manufacturer of the camera, based on Exif metadata.

This is rational number, which in our data ranges from 1/1, 000 seconds to 1/30 seconds. Aperture refers to size of the opening in the lens and the corresponding amount of light thus allowed to enter the camera while taking the photo. This is measured in fnumbers, calculated as the ratio between the focal length and the diameter of the lens opening. In our experiments, these ratios range from 1.8 to 11. ISO Speed is parameter that measures the camera sensors sensitivity to light, with higher values leading to higher sensitivity and lower values leading to lower sensitivity. In our data, these numbers range from 50 to 3200. Focal Length describes the distance between the center of the cameras lens and the cameras sensor. This is typically measured in mm. Our data covers focal lengths ranging from 4 mm to 200 mm. C. PairsCams dataset Cameras used to collect the PairsCams dataset are shown in Table with the number of images taken by each camera. D.

Originally designed for out-of-distribution detection, the dataset features disjoint test and training labels. Thus, we randomly split the provided validation set into our own training and test sets using 9:1 ratio. We follow the hyperparameter tuning and training protocol described in 3 Contrastive Vision-Language Supervised Self-Supervised learning Random"

Classification accuracy using linear classifier on embeddings of frozen visual encoders with no masking. Ordering is according to Tab. C. Sec. 3, using 12.5% of the training set for validation. Each image is annotated with metadata labels according to their aperture, ISO, and shutter speed labels, formulating fourclass classification task for each attribute. Fig. presents the performance of classifiers trained on frozen embeddings for the prediction of each attribute. Models across all categories achieve classification accuracy well above random chance. We attribute this to the broad range of values of the acquisition parameters used to create ImageNet-ES. For example, the ISO values of ImageNetESs validation set ranges from 200 to 12, 800, while the corresponding values in FlickrExif only range from 50 to 3, 200. This wider range may result in more visually distinguishable cases compared to those in FlickrExif. F. Effect of masking In this section, we assess the impact of the masking applied for the prediction of acquisition labels in Sec. 3.2. Fig. and Fig. show the classification accuracy on FlickrExif with 0% and 75% masking, respectively. Comparing the two figures with Fig. 6, we observe that retaining semantic information in the input images makes it easier to identify acquisition labels, leading to higher classification accuracy. This suggests potential correlations between acquisition labels and semantic content, which can be exploited by the models to achieve better performance.
