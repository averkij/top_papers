            "title": "1 Introduction\nKnowledge extraction–obtaining knowledge from data, is a critical\ncomponent for a wide range of practical systems such as Knowl-\nedge Graph (KG) construction [1], Retrieval Augmentation (RAG)\n[3], and domain-specific applications like scientific discovery [2]\nand intelligence analysis [7]. The last decades have witnessed the\ndevelopment of various knowledge extraction systems [5, 9, 10]. In\nparticular, with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs),\nnew works such as InstructUIE [6], iText2KG [4] and AgentRE [8]\nhave been continuously emerged. However, previous approaches\nstill struggle to effectively extract information from raw data fol-\nlowing complex schemas and face challenges in debugging and\ncorrecting errors when they occur.",
            "content": "Note that previous efforts have primarily focused on the capabilities of individual models while neglecting the design of comprehensive system to address the knowledge extraction task. To this end, we introduce OneKE, dockerized schema-guided knowledge extraction system. We adopt multi-agent design with configure knowledge base to provide knowledge extraction support for various scenarios and error debugging, aiming to meet the practical needs of users as much as possible. Following [6], Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Luo et al. Figure 1: The overview of the OneKE system, supporting various domains (science, news, etc.) and data (Web HTML, PDF, etc.). we design three agents: Schema Agent for schema analysis with various data types, Extraction Agent for extracting knowledge with various LLMs, and Reflection Agent to debug and handle erroneous cases. Based on this design, OneKE can efficiently process source texts of varying lengths and formats, such as HTML and PDF, and demonstrates robust capability to adapt to diverse task configurations, yielding comprehensive range of output schemas tailored to specific requirements. We evaluate OneKE using two benchmark datasets for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, to explore the versatility of OneKE in practical applications, we conduct case analyses on specific extraction tasks. These scenarios encompass extracting structured information from the Web news articles and raw PDF book chapters, highlighting OneKEs capability to manage diverse data formats and varying task contexts effectively. This flexible framework, which operates without the necessity of finetuning, is adept at swift adaptation to forthcoming LLMs, thereby amplifying their capabilities and elevating their overall efficacy."

As shown in Figure 1,\nthe framework is guided by several key considerations that enhance\nits functionality and adaptability in real-world scenario:",
            "content": "(1) Adaptability to real-world data. Real-world information extraction tasks often handle raw data, like HTML, PDF, etc. Based on this, the OneKE framework supports variety of data types rather than pure text. We also reserve user-defined interface to support new data types in the future. (2) Generalization for complex schemas. Practical knowledge extraction scenarios should handle diverse and complex schemas, or even no schema. Thus, we design the OneKE-specific Schema Agent to support both pre-defined schemas and self-schema deduction using LLMs. OneKE also supports various LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen and ChatGLM, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4, enabling effective knowledge extraction. (3) Debugging and fixing errors. Most previous works require retraining the model when encountering error cases. In contrast, we integrate Case Repository into OneKE to equip the model with reflective and error-correcting capabilities, enabling its continuous improvement in knowledge extraction tasks."

These cases are then incorporated as few-shot examples into the original context to form the prompt, after which the LLM is called to obtain the extraction results. After the above steps, we obtain the preliminary extraction results; however, errors often occur. To address this, we design reflection agent to debug and fix these errors. We use self-consistency to filter out the cases where the model is uncertain and pass these cases to the Reflection Agent."

In the OneKE system, the Schema Repository\nprovides the pre-defined schema for the Schema Agent, supporting\nthe subsequent extraction process. Specifically, the Schema Repos-\nitory includes pre-defined output schemas for NER, RE, and EE\ntasks, along with templates for various data scenarios such as scien-\ntific academic papers and news reports. The schemas in the Schema\nRepository are structured as Pydantic objects, enabling seamless\nserialization into JSON format for the Extraction Agent. Moreover,\nthis structure allows users to customize new schemas within the\nrepository, thus enhancing adaptability and extensibility.\nCase Repository. To enable debugging and error correction in\nOneKE, we design the Case Repository, which primarily stores\ntraces of past knowledge extraction cases. This repository sup-\nports the Extraction Agent in performing extractions and assists\nthe Reflection Agent in reflecting on and correcting errors. Specif-\nically, knowledge extraction cases stored in Case Repository can\nbe divided into two categories: Correct Cases and Bad Cases. Cor-\nrect Cases provide the Extraction Agent with reasoning steps of\nsuccessful extraction, while Bad Cases offer the Reflection Agent\nwarnings about avoidable mistakes. The Case Repository will be au-\ntomatically updated once a knowledge extraction task is completed.\nConcretely, this module first generates reasoning steps derived\nfrom the correct answer, storing both the correct answer and its\nreasoning steps in the Correct Case Repository to enhance task\nunderstanding. Additionally, the agent compares its answer with",

In the news domain, OneKE enhances the\nknowledge extraction of Web news content, thereby facilitating\ndownstream tasks such as effective sentiment monitoring, proactive\nrisk management, as well as a variety of additional applications. As\nillustrated in Figure 3, the extraction task starts with Extracting key\ninformation from news articles on a randomly selected raw HTML\npage from the web, aiming to identify the overall nature of the\nnews and obtain structured key insights. After parsing the HTML-\nformatted text, the Schema Agent first identifies its domain and\ngenre as a Politics News Report, offering crucial guidance. Utilizing\nthis metadata, the Schema Agent generates a structured Output\nSchema in code format that effectively captures the key information",

Once the Output Schema has been serialized into JSON format description, the Extraction Agent and the Reflection Agent collaborate to undertake subsequent extraction and reflective optimization tasks. This cooperative effort of the agents culminates in JSON output that captures the key information and structure of the news report. Book Knowledge Extraction. Another application of OneKE lies in extracting structured knowledge from extensive corpora, including books, documents, or manuals. Specifically, we use the first chapter of the Harry Potter series (with total length of 17 pages in PDF format) as the target text. The extraction focuses on the main characters and the background setting within this chapter. As shown in Figure 3, the generated Output Schema accurately identified the two target extraction objects: main_characters and background_setting. Subsequently, with the collaboration of the Extraction Agent and the Reflection Agent, OneKE successfully extracted relevant information."
