            "content": "Navigating and identifying new and relevant research findings has become non-trivial with the popularity of open-access repositories. For example, arXiv received over 24,000 submissions in October 2024 (arXiv, 2024), inundating researchers with an overwhelming volume of information. This astronomical surge in scholarly articles makes it difficult to identify novel findings and discern the distinctions between related papers, especially those presenting similar ideas from different angles (e.g., papers from different research communities). Automatically generating comparative summaries of research papers has proven valuable 1 for addressing these challenges (Hayashi et al., 2023). Existing comparative summarization works (Str√∂hle et al., 2023) typically follow two-step pipeline: (1) construct extractive summaries for each document to (2) identify their similarities and differences (Lerman and McDonald, 2009; Gunel et al., 2024). However, despite using large language models (LLMs), these methods often focus on surface-level semantic differences, which may not capture the most relevant distinctions. For example, when comparing pre-trained models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), it is crucial to note that RoBERTa omits next-sentence prediction, trains on ten times more data, and achieves superior performance. These insights require complex, comparative reasoning beyond basic semantics, as they rely on understanding BERTs contributions in the context of RoBERTas. Thus, we propose the following principles: Multi-persona debates elicit complex, comparative reasoning. We explore the use of multi-agent debates for inducing fine-grained, comparative reasoning. These debates simulate group discussions where agents suggest diverse answers, critique one another, and refine responses to produce better outputs (Chan et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024). Recent work has also introduced defining LLM agents as personas with distinct characteristics or values, enabling them to generate outputs that reflect the diverse perspectives needed to solve multi-faceted problems (Tseng et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c). Inspired by this, we propose converting scientific papers into personas that debate each other to foster critical analysis. For instance, while the papers debate their respective contributions to topic, they critically evaluate each others novelty and significance relative to their own claims. Tree-structured debates allow for independent assessments of different contributions at varying depths. scientific paper often makes contributions (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluabe more fine-grained and relevant to the subtopic. We integrate these proposed principles into Treeof-Debate, framework which dynamically structures debate between paper personas, conducted by moderator. First, each persona prepares (selfdeliberation) by retrieving topic-relevant segments from their paper, identifying their novel contributions, and updating their evidence pool based on the oppositions claimed contributions (Section 3.3). Based on this, the moderator determines the most valuable subtopics to explore (e.g., second level of Figure 1). For each subtopic, child debate node is formed, where each persona presents their initial arguments, responds to one another (e.g., clarifying questions, doubts), and revises their argument based on the interaction. Based on the debate, the moderator determines if the debate node is worth expanding and exploring deeper into (Section 3.4). If so, more fine-grained set of subtopics are determined for the next level of debate children (Section 3.2.2). Our contributions can be summarized as: We introduce Tree-of-Debate, structured multi-persona debate framework, to generate fine-grained contrastive summaries. Tree-of-Debate can dynamically construct debate tree to reason about fine-grained arguments discussed in scholarly articles. Through experiments on real-world scientific literature, we show that Tree-of-Debates elicits informative arguments and contrasts papers, aiding researchers in their work. Reproducibility: We provide our dataset and source code1 to facilitate further studies."

            "content": "Similar to how persons background shapes their abilities, recent work has explored assigning personas to LLMs to capture diverse perspectives and extract unique capabilities (Fu et al., 2023). For instance, Portenoy et al. (2022) creates author personas for author recommendation by applying named entity recognition to papers and matches authors based on shared terminology. As we aim to highlight specific novelties and incremental contributions between two papers, we instead define paper persona. While Portenoy et al. (2022)s personas represent the authors multiple works and 1https://github.com/pkargupta/tree-of-debate Figure 1: hierarchy of contributions made by Papers and B, specific to the root topic. Green check mark: single paper makes unique contribution; red X: an overlapping contribution. tion metric) that can be deconstructed into multiple sub-ideas. Some sub-ideas may or may not be novel (e.g., uses an existing architecture, but proposes novel fine-tuning and evaluation mechanisms) and consequently, should be independently evaluated for their degree of novelty. Hence, an unstructured debate combining all ideas is insufficient for handling the complexity of scientific comparative analysis. We instead propose tree-structured debate, where each node represents specific contribution topic being debated, and an edge indicates unresolved points or interesting questions from the parent debate node which warrant further exploration in child node. Figure 1 illustrates these topical relationships. Iterative retrieval throughout debate improves fine-grained reasoning. Due to their lengthy nature, providing an entire paper in-context is ineffective, as details specific to the debate node topic may be overshadowed (Li et al., 2024). Conversely, using only the title and abstract results in high-level comparisons based on surface-level semantic differences. To address these long-context challenges, we propose an iterative retrieval process, where retrieval queries are dynamically determined by the debates content. This ensures the retrieved content is targeted to the specific contribution in question, enabling personas to generate more compelling affirmative or opposing arguments. For instance, as the debate progresses from reasoning evaluation to domain-expert evaluation in Figure 1, the evidence pool is updated to are used solely for comparison, ours represent the paper, actively debating for and defending it. Other studies have also leveraged persona-driven debate by assigning multiple personas such as affirmative and negative debaters along with judge to synthesize diverse reasoning steps for tasks like commonsense generation and arithmetic, thereby reducing confirmation bias inherent in self-reflection methods (Liang et al., 2024). Although our objective differs, we similarly employ debate not to serve as means to improve the final output but, rather, as the outcome itself using the tree directly to generate refined summaries of differences between research papers. 2.2 Comparative Summarization Generating comparative summaries is challenging due to the diverse ways that differences between two entities can be represented. Traditional graphbased methods (Chen et al., 2022; Str√∂hle et al., 2023) classify sentences as claim, similarity, or difference and score them to produce extractive summaries. While we use extractive summarization questions for self-deliberation, ultimately we aim to generate an abstractive summary that synthesizes the debate results. More recent works (Luu et al., 2021) fine-tune models to generate explanation sentences by first extracting in-text citation sentences that compare principal document with cited one, then maximizing the probability of generating the explanation given the two documents; however, this approach typically yields only single sentence, which may not fully capture the nuanced differences between papers."

Certain works within the HCI space (Palani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024), which have designed off-the-shelf, interactive systems. However, from methodological standpoint, one approach (Shi et al., 2023) expands papers abstract into semantically similar sentences to form search queries for retrieving relevant papers, and then uses incontext examples to generate related work sections. On the other hand, DIR (Wang et al., 2024a) employs structured fine-tuning process by prompting language model to extract commonalities and differences from candidate summaries compared to gold standard. However, these methods face limitations: the former is highly dependent on the quality of its in-context example without clear guidelines on how to structure the related work. The latter requires fine-tuning the model for each dataset and relies on similarity matching that can restrict summary content (Liu et al., 2023; Hayashi et al., 2023). In contrast, our method uses debate rounds to guide the summary structure, operates at inference-time without training making it domain-agnostic and leverages the reasoning capabilities of language models to identify isomorphic properties of ideas beyond mere semantic similarity."

While we explored novelty-specific claims (e.g., p1s contribution towards ni is more novel than p2s), this led to more surface-level arguments. Moreover, paper often features breadth of claims/ideas, motivating debate structure that is flexible to explore these different angles independently. Thus, we propose TREE-OF-DEBATE (ToD), , where each node represents round of debate (Section 3.2.2). directed edge from parent node np to child node np indicates the debate progressing into one of nps subtopics np (out of potentially subtopics).

Each paper personas pi role is to argue that their contributions towards the topic ni are better than persona pjs. Moderator: Using the same underlying model as the paper personas, the moderator (i) identifies key debate subtopics for determining the papers similarities and differences, (ii) judges the progression of the debate based on the authors arguments, and (iii) synthesizes the debate tree into comparative summary. 4 3.2.2 Tree Node Format Each tree node with topic ni undergoes threestage debate (pre-, during, and post-debate). The format is as follows: 1. Self-Deliberation (Section 3.3): Each persona pa retrieves segments Sa relevant to ni, generates claims Ca for their novel contributions, cites corresponding evidence Ea , and collects counter-evidence from their own paper (cid:101)Ea . The moderator then selects new subtopics for the next level of children, ni Sa i. 2. Debate (Prompts 13, 14, and 15): For each child debate node ni j, each persona pa (i) presents an argument that pa is better than pb on nj, (ii) responds to the opposing argument, and (iii) revises their argument accordingly. 3. Determine Expansion (Section 3.4): Based on the debate at ni j, the moderator determines whether the arguments progressed or introduced any unresolved questions meriting another round.

For each paper (i,j) Cb , we retrieve additional segments (cid:101)Ea pa{1,2}, we retrieve the top Œ¥ segments Si a{1,2} conditioned on node topic ni using the retrieval embedding model (Xiao et al., 2023) (Section 3.1.2). We embed ni using the query format: [topic name] : [topic description] (the moderator generates description for each non-root node). These segments form two separate pools of evidence per paper to compose their novelty claims. Preemption. For each of paper pbs novelty claims cb with its corresponding evidence Eb (i,j) from pa using the concatenated title and description of cb (i,j) as the query. Each retrieved segment is then filtered using an LLM-based step (Prompt 12) that evaluates whether (1) supports, (2) refutes, (3) clarifies pbs claim, or (4) is irrelevant. While redundant, we notice that explicitly including (4) as an option helps with filtration performance. If either (1-3) are true or (4) is false, then is filtered out. If (cid:101)Ei (a,j) = 0, we indicate that pa does not address pbs claim, cb (i,j). Overall, preemption allows the paper personas to be better prepared for their oppositions arguments ahead of the debate. Subtopic Generation. Using each papers title, abstract, Ci, Ei, and (cid:101)Ei, the moderator generates i that should be further explored subtopics ni (Prompt 8). The moderator maps each subtopic to at least one claim ci from either p1 and/or p2, forming child debate nodes that explore overlapping topics (e.g., Reasoning Evaluation in Figure 1) or topics potentially unique to one paper (e.g., Multiple Paths)."

            "content": "While we motivate the personas to examine and debate whether their work proposes better idea than their opposition, this mechanism is intended to (1) emphasize the reasoning behind the idea and (2) provoke debate on the novelty behind the ideas, relative to each other. In other words, we hypothesize that two very similar ideas (e.g., Reasoning Evaluation in Figure 1) will typically lead to longer debate subtree on which approach is better. Conversely, uniquely novel approach or 5 task proposed in p1, relative to p2, may result in shorter debate as the moderator will ideally determine that p2 does not address p1s claim in their work and thus has weak argument (e.g., Backtracking in Figure 1). To facilitate this process, the moderators core tasks are detailed below. 3.4.1 Determining Round Depth Expansion For debate node ni, the moderator assesses the following (Prompt 9): 1. Argument Progression: Is there sufficient evolution in the arguments or new, deeper concepts being introduced to justify further debate? 2. Meaningful Questions: Have clarifying questions been raised that remain unanswered and merit further discussion? If no questions are raised, the moderator returns False. 3. Clear Winner: Is it clear that one paper has won the debate, as their contributions are truly better and do not warrant deconstruction (to determine which subcomponents are truly better)? If either (1) or (2) holds true, or if (3) does not indicate clear winner, the moderator proceeds to the self-deliberation stage (Section 3.3) to identify new i. Otherwise, subtopics and expand ni to ni expansion stops for that debate path. maximum tree depth is also enforced."

Consequently, we aimed to construct dataset with papers that both cite and do not cite each other, in order to test the robustness of Tree-of-Debate. However, novelty comparison between papers is highly specialized and expensive task, requiring rich domain expertise to verify especially if such papers do not explicitly cite one another.

Each researcher identified at least five papers they were highly familiar with, such that they could perform detailed and informed human evaluation.

To contextualize improvements from each component in ToD, we construct the following ablative methods: (1) ToD (No Tree) removes the tree structure by merging child arguments into one and considering the combined subtopic as the debate node topic; (2) ToD (No SD) removes self-deliberation (SD) to test the impact of iterative retrieval based on debate progression. No SD relies on the title, abstract, and introduction of each paper instead of retrieving based on the subtopic. We use the same LLM for all comparisons.

Stage Dialogue for Subtopic: Generalizability and Flexibility of Prompting Methods Present ToT: ToT enhances flexibility via deliberate reasoning by exploring multiple paths, self-evaluation of choices, and lookahead/backtracking capabilities shown on diverse set of tasks like Game of 24 and Creative Writing. This is in contrast to CoTs lack of deliberate reasoning and adaptability. CoT: CoT excels in generalizability through its simplicity, requiring minimal examples to achieve strong results across tasks. Unlike ToT, it avoids complex setups and can generalize to unseen tasks, making it more adaptable with fewer computational demands. Respond ToT: While CoT is simpler, ToTs added complexity is necessary trade-off for deeper reasoning tasks, requiring non-trivial planning and search. CoTs ability to handle deeply nested or conditional reasoning remains unproven. CoT: ToT may help in specific tasks, but CoTs simplicity deliberately ensures broader applicability without overfitting to specific task requirements. Though direct evidence for nested reasoning is lacking, CoTs state-ofthe-art GSM8K performance suggests complex reasoning robustness. future study can compare both methods on nested reasoning to settle this question empirically. Revise ToT: ToT has enhanced flexibility via adaptive reasoning path exploration exploring multiple reasoning paths and leveraging self-evaluation and lookahead/backtracking to tackle complex tasks as shown on our diverse problem domains. Our deliberate decision-making is advantageous for tasks with deeply nested or highly conditional reasoning paths, where CoT may falter. CoT: CoT maintains strong generalizability by balancing simplicity and effectiveness including those with complex reasoning requirements without overfitting to specific task needs. This is demonstrated through its SoTA performance on GSM8K. specific contributions made by each paper, noting them as either similarities or differences. However, these tend to resemble extractive summaries, where phrases that are semantically similar or dissimilar are extracted from the papers abstracts and introduction and are posed as similarities and differences respectively, with no context provided on why this is the case. We further analyze this finding in Section 5.1. Moreover, we see that without the tree-structure, the debates analysis quality deteriorates. Specifically, for our No Tree ablation study  (Table 2)  , we modify our method to combine all proposed subtopics by the moderator (Section 3.3) into single high-level topic. This leads to lower contextualization and breadth of contributions discussed, due to reasoning difficulty in disentangling the contributions during the debate. Thus, structuring the debate is necessary to experience its contextualization benefits. Retrieval-augmented debate ensures factuality and breadth of comparison. In Table 2, we compare the performance between ToD and No SD, where the latter ablation replaces the iterative retrieval step with simply providing the papers title, abstract, and introduction as in-context evidence across the entire debate tree (same setting as the two baselines). We observe that No SD still experiences the strong benefits of the structured de7 Model Comparative Summary Excerpts Two Stage ToD MEGClass focuses on mutually-enhancing text granularities, iteratively refining its model through feedback between document, sentence, and word levels, and requires an initial set of weakly labeled data. In contrast, LOTClass innovates by relying solely on label names to train its model, employing language model self-training approach that obviates the need for any labeled documents, achieving high accuracy without human-labeled data. Both papers leverage limited labeled data to achieve robust performance. Both MEGClass and LOTClass also employ iterative refinement techniques, with MEGClass using iterative feedback and LOTClass utilizing self-training on unlabeled data. MEGClass uniquely leverages mutually-enhancing text granularities, capturing both coarseand fine-grained context signals to provide more comprehensive understanding of class labels. In contrast, LOTClass relies solely on label names, leveraging pre-trained language models to drive self-training mechanism. Furthermore, MEGClasss adaptive granularity balancing approach provides robustness to label name selection, whereas LOTClasss reliance on label names alone may introduce biases.

We note drop in the factuality and breadth of the summary. The information present in the abstract and introduction is not detailed or deep enough to facilitate finegrained discussion of the paper. This leads to more noise, and hallucinations, which negatively impacts No SDs breadth and factuality scores. Therefore, iterative evidence retrieval is necessary for exploring in breadth and minimizing hallucinations. TOD is robust to all comparison settings. We analyze four different comparison settings (as detailed in Section 4.1), where two papers may or may not cite each other and differ in either their task or method. We can see through Table 2 that regardless of their comparison type, ToD demonstrates consistently high performance with only an average standard deviation œÉ = 2.49 across breadth and soundness, while Single Stages œÉ = 5.32 and Two Stages œÉ = 3.39. While there are no consistent trends across the different settings, studying them allows us to ensure the consistency of ToD."

However, CoT counters that ToTs complexity hinders broad applicability, whereas CoT can easily generalize to multitude of tasks with minimal setup while still achieving stateof-the-art results. In the revision stage, both refine their arguments: ToT emphasizes adaptive exploration for complex reasoning, while CoT maintains its simplicity, now citing empirical success in complex tasks. It is interesting to note that during the Respond stage, CoT suggests future study that would help validate the claims made in the debate. Contextualized Summaries. The baselines summaries tend to be extractive, not explaining why certain comparisons are important and also mistaking similarities for differences if their wording is semantically dissimilar. Table 4 demonstrates this finding; Two Stage mistakenly states that MEGClass requires an initial set of weakly labeled data while LOTClass innovates by relying solely on label names. However, this is false both methods only require the class label names. This similarity is identified by ToD, which uses it to contextualize the methods differences: both use label names, however MEGClass considers all three levels of text granularity, while LOTClass solely relies on the label names. ToD also provides further insight into LOTClasss over-reliance on label names potentially introducing biases. ToDs debate format elicits critical reasoning and allows for more insightful, contextualized comparison.

            "content": "Automatic summarization is essential for managing the growing volume of research. We introduce TREE-OF-DEBATE, structured approach that models papers as personas engaging in debate to extract their key similarities and differences. Our method organizes debates into hierarchical structure to produce abstractive and contextualization summaries while preserving their factuality. With thorough domain-expert empirical evaluation and qualitative case studies, we demonstrate that Treeof-Debate significantly outperforms baselines."

            "title": "7 Limitations & Future Work",
            "content": "We explore some limitations of our work. Within each debate round (each persona presenting their arguments, responding to one another, and revising their arguments), we note that crucial element to productive debate round is each persona providing meaningful feedback (e.g., doubts, clarifying questions) within the respond stage. However, the quality of this critical response may vary based on the difficulty of the task (e.g., more fine-grained topic that has no presence within the models existing pre-training dataset) and/or the size of the model. We also observe slight trade-off between contextualization and factuality. Especially in more challenging comparisons where the overlap between the papers may not be explicit (e.g., taskbased comparisons), ToD must take more of leap with respect to its reasoning to identify similarities and differences between the papers, which may lead to further hallucinations. Furthermore, we notice that as debate path progresses to deeper levels, if certain evidence is not present to support papers fine-grained claims, the personas begin to suggest potential future studies or even new methods (e.g., combining certain strengths of the two methods). While this does introduce some noise (as we can see through our competitive factuality scores, this is minimal) to our output summary, these types of hallucinations present exciting new paths for research to explore. Tree-of-Debate can be extended to other general, complex reasoning tasks which can exploit our tree-based decomposition and debate-based critical feedback. For instance, complex quantitative reasoning problems can often be decomposed into several sub-problems, which can be represented within our tree structure. Each persona can instead represent different approach to solve that specific sub-problem. We can also consider extending this to negotiation setting, where there are various aspects to consider when determining the optimal compromise. For example, two parties can negotiate on price of car with respect to its make, model, mileage, etc. Each of these can be explored within their own respective subtrees."

We then use the generated summaries to prompt the model to generate contrastive summary (Zhang et al., 2024). To contextualize improvements from each component in Tree-of-Debate we construct the following ablative methods: ToD (No Tree): We remove the tree structure from Tree-of-Debate by merging child arguments into one. We do so by concatenating the topics and descriptions of the child subtopics and tag them to distinguish the topics. In each debate round, the model is prompted with the combined subtopic and its corresponding description. ToD (No SD): We remove self-deliberation (SD) to test the impact of iterative retrieval based on debate progression. We do so by prompting the model with title, abstract, and introduction of each paper instead of retrieving based on the subtopic."

This is evaluated using the following Likert scale: 0. Not at all, the summary misses (MULTIPLE) major points. 1. No, the summary misses (SINGULAR) major point. 2. Somewhat, the summary misses minor points. 3. Yes, the summary covers the major points, but still is not what would expect. 4.

Not at all, the summary is simply extractive it just seems to take different subtopics from each paper and doesnt synthesize them no justification behind similarities and differences. 1. No, the summary attempts at some level of synthesis, but it is not meaningful. 2. Somewhat, the summary attempts at synthesizing at most one point. 3. Yes, the summary contains meaningful synthesis but only for minority of points. 4. Strongly contextualized, the summary contains meaningful synthesis across all major points.

It also makes vague claims near the end of summaries (example is the second line highlighted in red: Despite overlapping in their pursuit of enhancing educational experiences...). The overall structure results in suboptimal summary. Next, the top right box contains the summary for ToD (No Tree). The use of the debate format improves the quality of the generated claims. Unlike in the Two-Stage summary, it does not contain many extractive phrases, however the structure of the debate is still fine-grained to coarse-grained. Intuitively, the summaries should develop coarse-grained claims into fine-grained arguments. Moreover, there are slight hallucinations (examples are in the second and third lines highlighted in red: Bridge on continuous expert... and TreeInstruct is designed...). Still, the conclusion (last sentence) of the summary is not as vague as the conclusion from Two-Stage, but it still does not capture the intricacies of the two methods well enough. 13 Table 6: Summaries from two methods: ToD (No Tree) the TREE-OF-DEBATE ablation and the Two-Stage baseline. The papers being compared are TreeInstruct and BRIDGE: they develop LLM-based instructors that guide students towards the answers to their questions rather than give away the answers. The rest of the table follows in 7. Two-Stage ToD (No Tree) Both papers focus on enhancing educational experiences through innovative technological approaches. Both utilize novel methodologies to address specific learning challenges (code debugging for Paper 0 and math remediation for Paper 1). Both papers emphasize the importance of real-world validation and case studies to assess the effectiveness of their proposed solutions. Topic Focus: Paper 0 focuses on code debugging with TreeInstruct, while Paper 1 addresses math mistake remediation with the Bridge method. Methodological Approach: Paper 0 employs state space estimation and dynamic tree-based questioning, whereas Paper 1 utilizes cognitive task analysis and decision-making models. Evaluation Metrics: Paper 0 measures performance on debugging datasets and student engagement, whereas Paper 1 assesses the preference for LLM responses with expert decisions and conducts lexical analysis. Target Audience: Paper 0s work is geared towards students of varying skill levels in code debugging, whereas Paper 1 focuses on 1st-5th grade students in Title schools for math tutoring. While both papers contribute to the educational technology landscape, Paper 0s TreeInstruct offers novel approach to code debugging through adaptive Socratic questioning, and Paper 1s Bridge method innovatively embeds expert thought processes into LLMs for math remediation. Despite overlapping in their pursuit of enhancing educational experiences, the papers diverge significantly in their topics, methodologies, and target audiences, indicating broad and diverse landscape in educational technology research. Papers on adaptive guidance systems debate similarities and differences for effective Socratic questioning. While both papers aim to enhance adaptive guidance, they differ in approach: TreeInstruct (Paper 0) emphasizes adaptive, expert-agnostic planning, leveraging dynamic question trees and state space-based planning to address interdependent errors, whereas Bridge (Paper 1) focuses on expertinformed decision-making, incorporating domainspecific expert knowledge for more effective Socratic questioning. key difference lies in their handling of unforeseen errors, with TreeInstruct relying on dynamic adaptation and Bridge on continuous expert annotation and model fine-tuning. Another distinction is their applicability: TreeInstruct is designed for diverse educational domains, while Bridge initially focused on math education, later expanding to other domains. Both authors eventually converge on hybrid approach, combining expert guidance with adaptive planning for more comprehensive solution. Despite this, their initial differences in methodology and error handling strategies remain focal point of the debate. The debate highlights the importance of both adaptive planning and expert guidance in effective adaptive guidance systems. Ultimately, the synthesis of both approaches offers more robust solution for personalizing student learning experiences. 14 Table 7: Summaries from two methods: ToD (No SD) the TREE-OF-DEBATE ablation and TREE-OF-DEBATE. The papers being compared are TreeInstruct and BRIDGE: they develop LLM-based instructors that guide students towards the answers to their questions rather than give away the answers. The rest of the table follows in 6. ToD (No SD) ToD (Final) The papers share similarities in their focus on adaptive, student-centered approaches for mistake correction, leveraging AI-driven tools to enhance personalized learning experiences. Both papers emphasize the importance of context-aware feedback and expert guidance in promoting deeper understanding. However, the papers diverge in their novelties. Paper 0s paper, Instruct, Not Assist, uniquely integrates adaptive, multi-turn Socratic questioning with state space estimation, providing more holistic and adaptable learning experience. In contrast, Paper 1s paper, Bridging the Novice-Expert Gap, focuses on modular, expert-guided decision-making, offering more explicit and scalable approach to addressing complex, interdependent mistakes. While Paper 0s approach excels in handling ambiguous student responses, Paper 1s method provides more nuanced, human-centric guidance. The papers also differ in their evaluation metrics, with Paper 0 emphasizing robust state space estimation and Paper 1 highlighting the importance of contextual relevance. Ultimately, the papers present complementary approaches, with Paper 0s work prioritizing adaptability and Paper 1s work emphasizing expert-driven contextualization. The papers by Paper 0 and Paper 1 share similarities in their focus on adaptive error resolution strategies, emphasizing the importance of context-sensitive decision-making and expert knowledge in enhancing student learning outcomes. Both papers also highlight the limitations of current LLMs in educational settings and propose novel methodologies to address these challenges. However, the papers diverge in their approaches to achieving these goals. Paper 0s paper, Instruct, Not Assist, uniquely integrates dynamic planning and hierarchical questioning to provide more nuanced understanding of student thought processes, scaling to accommodate diverse student populations. In contrast, Paper 1s paper, Bridging the Novice-Expert Gap, leverages expert decision-making models to inform adaptive error resolution strategies, offering more domain-agnostic framework. The papers also differ in their evaluation frameworks, with Paper 0s approach utilizing state space-based planning algorithm and Paper 1s method incorporating transfer learning and domainspecific expert annotations. Furthermore, Paper 0 emphasizes the importance of adaptive Socratic questioning, while Paper 1 highlights the value of expertguided decision-making in enhancing educational support. Ultimately, the papers present distinct novelties in addressing the novice-expert gap, with Paper 0 focusing on adaptive structured planning and Paper 1 on context-aware expert decision embedding. 15 Subsequently, the summary for ToD (No SD) is on the bottom left. The benefits of the tree are drastic, as the summary starts by discussing the high-level summaries, and breaks down the individual fine-grained differences. This is much less extractive and more abstractive. Using the tree structure along with the debate allows each argument to be explored further this is evident as after each claim, an explanation of why it matters follows (example is the line highlighted in green: While Paper 0s approach excels in...). Still, few of these explanations are vague and do not reveal the true underlying motivation of the claims (highlighted in red). Finally, the summary for ToD (our final method) is in the bottom right box. With the self-deliberation, it was able to extract short phrase of the motivation behind both works (the limitations of current LLMs in educational settings). The arguments are developed from high-level claims to low-level, technical concepts. The facts are correctly identified and do not contain any hallucinations. Moreover, the explanations preceding the claims also reveal the underlying motivation behind the specific novelty. Finally, the concluding sentence explains the exact difference between the two works."

Specifically, determine the following (True or False for each): 1. progression_of_arguments: Are these arguments sufficiently different enough to necessitate further debate? Are there new, deeper concepts being discussed between the two sets of arguments? 2. meaningful_questions: Within the debate history, each author acknowledges each others arguments and may ask clarifying questions accordingly. Do you believe that the clarifying questions have not been sufficiently addressed already and would be important to answer through further debate? If there are no questions raised in the debate history by either author, return False. 3. clear_winner: Do you believe that it is clear that one author has won the debate, and it does not need to be further deconstructured (in order to determine which components within each authors contributions are truly better)? Output your argument in the following format: \"explanation\": <2-5 sentence string to explain your reasoning about whether further debate is necessary when comparing the previous arguments and the current arguments>, \"progression_of_arguments\": <output boolean; pick only one of \"True\" or \"False\" depending on the history, arguments, and your explanation above>, \"meaningful_questions\": <output boolean; pick only one of \"True\" or \"False\" depending on the history, arguments, and your explanation above>, \"clear_winner\": <output boolean; pick only one of \"True\" or \"False\" depending on the history, arguments, and your explanation above> Table 9: Moderator prompt on whether to expand debate node. Two authors are debating their respective novelties with respect to the following topic: Topic: <Topic> Author 0s paper title is: <Author 0 paper title> Author 1s paper title is: <Author 1 paper title> Here is breakdown of their debates in tree format. At each tree node, we provide the \"topic_title\" : \"topic description\", Author 0s corresponding argument and Author 1s corresponding argument: <tree (example in Appendix H)> Based on the debate breakdown, output paragraph-long synthesis of the debate which summarizes the similarities and differences between the papers. Structure your summary with initially their similarities (which ideas/aspects overlap between the two papers?) to their differences (what makes the papers unique) in novelties. Focus more on the differences than the similarities. Table 10: Moderator prompt to summarize the debate into paragraph. 18 You are the author of the paper, self.paper.title. The abstract of your work is: <Paper Abstract>. You are debating another author on the novel contributions your work makes towards the following topic: <Topic>. Below is list of relevant evidence retrieved from your paper:<Evidence in the form of sentence excerpts from papers>. Based on the evidence, output list of 1 to <k> DIVERSE, specific arguments for your position that are all supported by the evidence. Each argument should have corresponding \"argument_title\", which is brief statement of your argument (e.g., Better Efficiency for Training), \"description\" explaining your argument and mentioning specific excerpts from your evidence pool, and finally, list of all \"evidence\" IDs, which are the integers of the evidence in the input list, that best support your argument. For example, if Evidence #1 and #2 best support your argument, then evidence should be [1,2] (depending on your argument, this list can have more or less than two items). Each argument should make unique point. Output your list of arguments in the following format: \"argument_title\": <should be brief, 10-15 word string where the value is the argument_title>, \"description\": <1-2 sentence string explaining the argument, including specific excerpts from the evidence pool>, \"evidence\": <list of integer IDs citing which evidence from the input list best support your argument> Table 11: Persona prompt to generate arguments during the debate. Your objective is to check if given evidence is relevant to claim or not (relevancy means evidence that helps either support, refute, or clarify the given claim). Claim: Argument Description of Claim: Argument Description Evidence: Evidence supporting the argument. Fill out the following schema: \"supports_claim\": <\"Yes\"/\"No\" if the evidence supports the claim>, \"refutes_claim\": <\"Yes\"/\"No\" if the evidence refutes the oppositions claim> \"clarifies_claim\": <\"Yes\"/\"No\" if the evidence clarifies the claim>, \"irrelevant_to_claim\": <\"Yes\"/\"No\" if the evidence is irrelevant to the claim>, Table 12: Persona prompt to determine relevant and irrelevant evidences. 19 You are the author of the paper, <Paper Title>. The abstract of your work is: <Paper Abstract>. You are debating another author (Opposition), whose work is titled, <Opposition Paper Title>, and abstract is: Opposition Paper Abstract\". You are debating the other author on how and why your paper makes better contribution towards the following topic: Topic: <topic> Topic Description: <topic description> Here are your claimed contributions towards the topic: Author 0 Papers Contributions #1: <argument>: <argument description> Author 0 Papers Contribution Evidence #1: <evidence towards argument> Author 1s relevant evidence to potentially counter the quality of this contribution: <counter evidence> ... (more contributions and counter-evidence) Given the above, make an argument for specific reason why your contributions towards the topic, Topic: <topic>, are better than the oppositions. If you feel that you do not contribute to the given topic or your contributions ARE NOT better than the oppositions, then state so by conceding to the opposition (e.g., do not believe my paper makes better contribution than yours) and explain why. Table 13: Persona prompt to present its arguments. You are the author of the paper, <Paper Title>. The abstract of your work is: <Paper Abstract>. You are debating another author (Opposition), whose work is titled, <Opposition Paper Title>, and abstract is: Opposition Paper Abstract\". You are debating the other author on how and why your paper makes better contribution towards the following topic: Topic: <topic> Topic Description: <topic description> Here are your claimed contributions towards the topic: Author 0 Papers Contributions #1: <argument>: <argument description> Author 0 Papers Contribution Evidence #1: <evidence towards argument> Author 1s relevant evidence to potentially counter the quality of this contribution: <counter evidence> ... (more contributions and counter-evidence) Here is your conversation debate history with the opposition paper. You must respond to the last argument presented by your opposition in debate. response may consist of (1) an acknowledgment of the oppositions previous response, (2) answering any of the questions about your paper brought up by the opposition, (3) asking any clarifying questions based on the oppositions claims and reasoning, (4) any clarifications of your own presented arguments based on the opposition, and/or (5) if you feel that the oppositions claim is strong and you do not have sufficient grounds to refute it, then concession to your opposition. conversation_history: <conversation history> Table 14: Persona prompt to respond to an argument. 20 You are the author of the paper, <Paper Title>. The abstract of your work is: <Paper Abstract>. You are debating another author (Opposition), whose work is titled, <Opposition Paper Title>, and abstract is: Opposition Paper Abstract\". You are debating the other author on how and why your paper makes better contribution towards the following topic: Topic: <topic> Topic Description: <topic description> Here are your claimed contributions towards the topic: Author 0 Papers Contributions #1: <argument>: <argument description> Author 0 Papers Contribution Evidence #1: <evidence towards argument> Author 1s relevant evidence to potentially counter the quality of this contribution: <counter evidence> ... (more contributions and counter-evidence) Based on the debate history and your/your oppositions arguments and evidence, you must construct new, stronger argument related to the topic. This consists of an argument that addresses/is robust to any doubts or clarifying questions made by the opposition which you feel are valid. If based on the debate, you feel that you do not contribute to the given topic or your contributions ARE NOT better than the oppositions, then state so by conceding to the opposition (e.g., do not believe my paper makes better contribution than yours) and explain why. conversation_history: <conversation history> Table 15: Persona prompt to revise to an argument."

Level 1 Child Argument: Personalized Error Resolution Strategies: Debate the effectiveness of adaptive, student-centered approaches in resolving errors, focusing on the role of dynamic question trees and expert decision-making models. This subtopic encourages discussion on the importance of tailoring guidance to individual students needs and knowledge gaps. Author 0s Argument: Adaptive Guidance Enhances Personalization via Nuanced Student Modeling. By integrating TreeInstructs dynamic question tree with nuanced student modeling framework, our approach provides more effective personalized error resolution strategies than Bridge. This integration enables TreeInstruct to capture the complexities of student thought processes, addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently, while also scaling to accommodate large, diverse student populations. In contrast, Bridges reliance on predetermined error types and remediation strategies may limit its versatility in complex, multi-bug scenarios. Author 1s Argument: Expert-Guided Decision-Making for Adaptive, Context-Sensitive Error Resolution. Our approach leverages expert decision-making to inform adaptive, contextsensitive error resolution strategies, demonstrated through the extension of our Bridge model to accommodate complex, multi-bug scenarios. By incorporating nuanced expert thought processes, our method provides more effective personalized guidance than TreeInstructs adaptive question tree approach. This integration of expert guidance and adaptability addresses the oppositions concerns regarding versatility and scalability in handling diverse student populations. (a) Level 2 Child Argument: Adaptive Guidance in Error Resolution: Debate the effectiveness of adaptive guidance in error resolution strategies, focusing on how each approach tailors feedback to individual students knowledge states. Discuss the benefits and limitations of each method. Author 0s Argument: Adaptive Guidance with Latent Expertise for Personalized Error Resolution. By integrating the strengths of both approaches, our revised argument proposes hybrid model that combines the adaptive guidance of TreeInstruct with the latent thought processes of expert decision-making. This fusion enables more nuanced understanding of individual student needs, providing targeted support while maintaining scalability and adaptability. Ultimately, this hybrid approach offers more effective and personalized error resolution strategy, surpassing the limitations of both adaptive guidance and expert decision-making alone. Author 1s Argument: Expert-Infused Adaptive Guidance for Error Resolution. Our revised approach integrates expert decision-making processes into adaptive guidance frameworks, enabling more nuanced understanding of individual student needs and providing targeted support while maintaining scalability and adaptability. This hybrid model combines the strengths of both approaches, offering more effective and personalized error resolution strategy. By incorporating expert-informed decision-making into adaptive guidance, we bridge the novice-expert knowledge gap more effectively than either approach alone."
