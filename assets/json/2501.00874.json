            "content": "Text embeddings, which provide dense vector representations of textual content (Mikolov et al., 2013; Devlin et al., 2019), have become fundamental building blocks in modern natural language processing. These embeddings encode semantic information and serve as an important component for numerous downstream applications, ranging from information retrieval and document reranking to classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity assessment. Recently, the significance 1 of high-quality embeddings has been further amplified by their crucial role in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems (Lewis et al., 2020b). RAG architectures enable large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access and integrate external or proprietary knowledge without the need for model parameter updates, substantially enhancing their adaptability and accuracy (Wang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Gao et al., 2024). The evolution of embedding models has witnessed remarkable advancements, progressing from static word embeddings (Robertson et al., 2009) through contextualized representations (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Gao et al., 2021b; Ni et al., 2021a) to state-of-the-art LLM-based embedding models (Wang et al., 2024b) that harness the sophisticated semantic understanding capabilities of large language models. These developments have substantially enhanced performance across various embedding tasks (Luo et al., 2024), achieving unprecedented accuracy in semantic similarity and retrieval applications. However, critical limitation remains: the predominant focus on English in LLM-based embedding models has created significant disparity in multilingual capabilities. This gap is especially pronounced in medium and lowresource languages, where English-centric models exhibit substantial performance degradation due to insufficient language-specific training data (Wang et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2024). While recent advances in multilingual embedding models, particularly those leveraging multilingual pre-trained architectures, have demonstrated promising results in multilingual embedding tasks (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c; Chen et al., 2024), their reliance on explicit multilingual supervision for embeddings constrains their applicability primarily to languages with abundant training resources, leaving the challenge of true language-agnostic representation largely unaddressed. To address this challenge, we present LUSIFER, novel zero-shot approach that adapts English LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring explicit multilingual supervision. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in multimodal integration (Liu et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024), LUSIFER employs unique architecture that bridges the gap between multilingual understanding and specialized embedding capabilities. At its core, LUSIFER leverages the robust multilingual representations from XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and introduces learnable connector mechanism to interface with English-optimized LLM embedding models. This approach enables LUSIFER to effectively transfer the multilingual understanding of XLM-R to the target LLM while inheriting advanced embedding capabilities of the LLM. In this way, LUCIFER can achieve effective multilingual representation capabilities without requiring explicit multilingual training data. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of LUSIFER through extensive experiments across 123 diverse datasets spanning 14 languages, focusing on five fundamental embedding tasks: Classification, Clustering, Reranking, Retrieval, and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). Our experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER substantially enhances the performance of English-centric LLMbased embedding models, achieving average improvements of 3.19 points across all tasks, with particularly significant gains observed for medium and low-resource languages (up to 22.15 improvement). To validate LUSIFERs broader applicability and cross-lingual capabilities, we extend our evaluation to cross-lingual tasks using four comprehensive datasets that encompass over 100 languages, including several critically low-resource languages. LUSIFER significantly outperforms existing English-centric embedding models by 5.75 on average in cross-lingual scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing multilingual representation capabilities without explicit multilingual supervision. The theoretical foundation for LUSIFERs effectiveness lies in its ability to create languageagnostic universal space through the integration of multilingual encoder (Pires et al., 2019; Libovick√Ω et al., 2020). We hypothesize that this universal space serves as bridge between different languages, enabling the target language model to process semantic information independently of the input language. By mapping these languageneutral representations to the target models input space, we conjecture that the target LLM can grasp the semantics of these representations, thereby improving the quality of output embeddings across multiple languages. This mechanism allows the model to become less dependent on the specific language of the input, enabling it to better capture semantic information for embedding tasks in languages it rarely encountered during pretraining. Our empirical analysis using t-SNE visualization supports this hypothesis."

            "title": "2.1 English-centric Embedding Models",
            "content": "Text embedding models have experienced significant advancement in recent years, driven by the evolution of pre-trained language models. Early successes with BERT-based architectures, as demonstrated in Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021b), and DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020), established the foundation for modern embedding approaches. The field has since progressed to leverage LLMs, with recent works (Wang et al., 2024b; Muennighoff et al., 2024; BehnamGhader et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Man et al., 2024) demonstrating substantial improvements in embedding quality and task performance through the enhanced representational capacity of LLMs (Luo et al., 2024). However, these advances primarily benefit high-resource language applications, as most state-of-the-art LLMbased embedding models are derived from Englishcentric foundation models (Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) and trained predominantly on English or high-resource language datasets (Wang et al., 2024b). This bias has resulted in significant performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, limiting the global applicability of these models. Our proposed method, LUSIFER, addresses this limitation by enabling effective multilingual representation without multilingual training data."

            "title": "2.2 Zero-shot Multilingual Embedding",
            "content": "Multilingual Embedding has evolved through several distinct methodological approaches, each addressing the fundamental challenge of bridging language gaps in embedding tasks. Early successful approaches relied on translation models to enable multilingual understanding (Liu et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021; Zhang and Misra, 2022). While effective, these methods introduced operational com2 plexity by requiring external translation systems, limiting their practical deployment and scalability. The emergence of multilingual pre-trained language models, particularly XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), opened new possibilities for multilingual transfer. Recent works have demonstrated promising results by fine-tuning such models with contrastive learning objectives on multilingual data (Wang et al., 2024c; Chen et al., 2024; Sturua et al., 2024). However, these approaches face two key limitations: they require substantial multilingual training data, and moreover, they do not exploit the sophisticated semantic representations afforded by contemporary English-centric LLM architectures, which have demonstrated superior performance in capturing nuanced semantic relationships. Recent advances in aligning multilingual and English-centric representations could offer solution. By combining independently pre-trained representations, paradigm that has shown remarkable success in multimodal alignment research (Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024), these works bridge the gap between visual encoders and language models to enhance visual comprehension. As such, similar principles can be applied to align multilingual representations with LLM-based semantic spaces. While related efforts have explored aligning multiple LLMs for improved reasoning capabilities in multilingual settings (Bansal et al., 2024; Yoon et al., 2024), these approaches primarily target generation tasks and typically require large-scale alignment data. Our work extends these efforts by focusing on embedding tasks and leveraging minimal set of parameters to align multilingual and English-centric representations, enabling enhanced multilingual representation capabilities without requirement for large-scale multilingual training data."

            "content": "The evaluation landscape for multilingual embedding models has historically been fragmented across various benchmarks, each with significant limitations. While existing benchmarks have made they often exhibit convaluable contributions, strained scope: MINERS (Winata et al., 2024) provides evaluation across multiple languages but is limited to classification and STS tasks with only 11 datasets; XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018), XQuAD (Artetxe et al., 2020), and SIB-200 (Adelani et al., 2024) offer broad language coverage but focus exclusively on classification tasks; and MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2023), despite its diverse task selection, primarily addresses high-resource languages. To address these limitations, we introduce comprehensive evaluation framework that encompasses 5 fundamental embedding tasksClassification, Clustering, Reranking, Retrieval, and STSacross an extensive collection of 123 datasets spanning 14 languages. This holistic approach enables systematic evaluation across both task and language dimensions, providing unprecedented insights into models multilingual capabilities. Furthermore, our benchmark extends beyond traditional multilingual evaluation by incorporating cross-lingual tasks, featuring coverage of over 100 languages, including critically low-resource languages that have been historically underrepresented in existing benchmarks. This extensive coverage allows for more nuanced understanding of embedding models performance across the global linguistic landscape."

            "content": "The core development of LUSIFER lies in its novel approach to enabling multilingual encoding of target LLMs through efficient representation mapping. As illustrated in Figure 1, LUSIFERs architecture consists of three key components: (1) multilingual encoder that functions as languageuniversal learner, capturing semantic information for diverse languages, (2) language-agnostic connector that serves as minimal parametric bridge between representations, and (3) target LLM optimized for embedding-specific tasks. The multilingual encoder processes input from various languages into shared semantic space, while the connector, designed with minimal trainable parameters, aligns these universal representations 3 Figure 1: Overview of LUSIFER.

Right: During inference, LUSIFER successfully processes text-embedding tasks across multiple languages. with the target LLMs native representational space. This alignment enables the target LLM embedding model to effectively leverage multilingual understanding without requiring extensive multilingual training data or architectural modifications. Following successful approaches in multimodal alignment (Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024), we implement the connector as 2-layers feed-forward network, FF, augmented with single trainable token appended to the multilingual encoders hidden states. Formally, given input tokens Xinput (with necessary padding), the multilingual encoders hidden states Henc are transformed to align with the target LLMs representational space. The resulting aligned hidden states Halign maintain dimensionality compatibility with the target LLMs hidden states while extending the sequence length by one (Xinput + 1): Halign = [FF(Henc); t], where FF is the feed-forward network to align the multilingual encoders hidden states with dimension de to the target LLMs hidden states with dimension dt, and Rdt is the trainable token. Moreover, we employ masking mechanism to mask any original padding tokens in Henc to prevent their influence on the target LLMs processing, ensuring the model focuses on meaningful tokens."

            "title": "3.2 Training Pipeline",
            "content": "LUSIFER employs two-stage training process to achieve optimal multilingual representation capabilities. Both stages only require training on English data, leveraging the multilingual encoders inherent language-agnostic properties and embedding advantages of LLMs to facilitate zero-shot multilingual transfer. Stage 1: Alignment Training. The initial training stage aligns the multilingual encoders representations with the target LLMs embedding space. Specifically, we optimize the connector parameters Œ∏c and the multilingual encoder parameters Œ∏e while keeping the target LLMs parameters fixed, ensuring stable convergence. The training employs two complementary objectives: (1) masked reconstruction task where we randomly mask k% of input tokens such that Xinput = mask(X, k), training the model to recover the original sequence Xlm = X. (2) An autoregressive completion task that focuses on next-token prediction, where the model learns to generate the target sequence Xlm conditioned on the input context Xinput. The training objective for both tasks is formulated as language modeling objective to generate the target sequence Xlm given the input sequence Xinput. This objective enables local token-level alignment through masked reconstruction task where the model learns to predict the masked tokens by leveraging the context. In addition, it exploits global semantic alignment through autoregressive completion task that encourages the model to capture semantic information of the input sequences to generate the target sequence. As such, our training strategy learns to align the multilingual encoders representations with the target LLMs embedding space while preserving important semantic information of multilingual input sequences. Our training process is conducted using the standard crossentropy loss function. Stage 2: Representation Finetuning. The second stage improves text representations through contrastive learning process, effectively teaching the model to distinguish between positive and 4 Figure 2: Overview of tasks and datasets in our benchmark. Crosslingual datasets are marked with blue shade. negative examples. Our approach leverages both in-batch negatives sampled from the current training batch and hard-negative examples specifically curated to enhance model training. Additionally, we incorporate bidirectional attention mechanisms within the target LLM, following recent advances in LLMs representation learning (Muennighoff et al., 2024; BehnamGhader et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Man et al., 2024). This bidirectional context modeling significantly enhances the quality of learned representations by enabling the model to capture both forward and backward dependencies in the input sequence. During this stage, we finetune all components of LUSIFER, including the target LLM, the multilingual encoder, and the connector parameters, to optimize the models representation quality for embedding-specific tasks. The goal of this stage is to improve the quality of text representations by leveraging the advanced embedding capabilities of the target LLM while maintaining the multilingual understanding provided by the multilingual encoder."

We employ XLM-Rlarge (Conneau et al., 2020) as the multilingual encoder, Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) as the Englishcentric target LLM, and 2-layer feed-forward network with one trainable token as the connector. To facilitate efficient training, we leverage the LoRA framework (Hu et al., 2022) for training of LUSIFERs components. Furthermore, we employ GradCache (Gao et al., 2021a), gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training, and FSDP (Zhao et al., 2023) to minimize GPU memory requirements.

We detail the training hyper-parameters for each stage in Table 4 of Appendix A. Training Data. We only train LUSIFER on diverse public English datasets. For alignment training, we use the combination of the English Wikipedia and questions-answering datasets. Specifically, we use subset of Wikitext-103 (Merity et al., 2017) and MSMARCO (Bajaj et al., 2018) for the masked reconstruction and autoregressive completion tasks, respectively. For representation finetuning, we adopt the retrieval datasets as follows: MS MARCO (Bajaj et al., 2018), NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), PAQ (Lewis et al., 2021), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), ArguAna (Wachsmuth et al., 2018), FiQA (Maia et al., 2018) and FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018).

            "content": "Table 1 presents the main results of LUSIFER and baseline models on the benchmark datasets. LUSIFER achieves state-of-the-art performance in 10 out of 14 languages, with an average score of 62.63 across all languages, 3.19 points improvement over the previous best-performing baseline, E5-Mistral (59.44) (Wang et al., 2024b). Note that E5-Mistral is essentially the Mistral model fine-tuned on extensive proprietary synthetic data and supplemented with some multilingual data for training. Our results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual capabilities of English-centric embedding LLM by aligning it with multilingual encoder, enabling effective multilingual representation without requiring explicit multilingual training data. The improvements are particularly pronounced for medium and lowresource languages, with Telugu (te) showing the largest gain of 22.15 points over E5-Mistral. This highlights LUSIFERs effectiveness in improving representation capabilities for traditionally underrepresented languages. Additionally, LUSIFER significantly outperforms the embedding models with SLM backbones, such as E5-large (38.48) and BGE-en-1.5 (39.98) which are trained on English data only, thus further demonstrating the benefits of combining multilingual encoder and LLMs English-centric for text-embedding tasks in multilingual settings. Furthermore, even without explicit multilingual supervision, LUSIFER achieves competitive performance (62.63) compared to stateof-the-art multilingual models that require extensive multilingual training data, such as BGE-M3 (64.80) (Chen et al., 2024) and Multilingual-E5large (64.54) (Wang et al., 2024d). These results further demonstrate the benefits of LUCIFER for multilingual representation learning while avoiding expensive multilingual data for text embeddings."

The points are colored by the language of the samples. The t-SNE representation of E5-Mistral demonstrates clearer separation between languages, with distinct clusters for each language. In contrast, the visualization of LUSIFER presents more mixed distribution of languages, with overlapping clusters across different languages. This observation provides insights into LUSIFERs lingual-agnostic capabilities, highlighting the models ability to bridge the gaps between representation spaces of different languages. These results suggest that LUSIFERs alignment strategy enables the model to comprehend semantics across multiple languages effectively, facilitating zero-shot multilingual transfer. Overall, our experiments confirm the advantages of the representation alignment strategies in LUCIFER to efFigure 4: Performance comparison of LUSIFER and baseline models on Reranking tasks. tiple languages effectively."

LUSIFER consistently outperforms the baseline models across 4 out of 5 tasks, with the largest improvements observed in Clustering and Retrieval tasks, especially in the medium and lowresource languages. However, the performance of LUSIFER in the Reranking tasks is slightly worse than the baseline models. This discrepancy may be attributed to the tasks complexity and the information loss in the alignment process between the multilingual encoder and the target LLM. Nevertheless, LUSIFERs strong performance across variety of tasks and languages highlights its ability to enhance multilingual representations without relying on explicit multilingual training data."
