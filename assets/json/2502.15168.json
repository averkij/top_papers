            "content": "Style embedding models seek to embed texts with similar style closer in the embedding space regardless of their content. Style embeddings are useful for tasks like style transfer and authorship attribution, but only exist for English (Wegmann et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2024b). Multilingual style embeddings could also serve to automatically evaluate style preservation in machine translation. Models like XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al., 2019) and E5 (Wang et al., 2024) create multilingual representations for semantic tasks, but have not addressed style mainly due to the scarcity of style datasets. We propose procedure, called multilingual STYLEDISTANCE (MSTYLEDISTANCE), to train style embeddings using contrastive learning with synthetic data in multiple languages. Early work on style representations learning often involved unlabeled social media data (Hay et al., 2020; Wegmann et al., 2022; Rivera-Soto et al., 2021; Patel *Denotes equal contribution 1 Figure 1: MSTYLEDISTANCE is trained using contrastive learning from synthetic positive and negative examples of 40 style features in 9 languages to form both multilingual and cross-lingual training triplets. et al., 2023), but Patel et al. (2024b) showed that contrastive learning objective with synthetic examples (sentence pairs with similar content and different style) can generate high quality style representations for English. We create MSYNTHSTEL, synthetic dataset of paraphrases addressing various style features in nine languages, and use it to create our multilingual style embeddings. In order to evaluate their quality, we contribute new multilingual and cross-lingual STEL-orContent (SoC) evaluation benchmark which, following the original SoC evaluation task (Wegmann et al., 2022), measures the ability of model to embed sentences with the same style closer in the embedding space than sentences with the same content. We show that MSTYLEDISTANCE embeddings outperform other representations on these evaluations, and demonstrate their usefulness in downstream setting addressing multilingual authorship verification task. We publicly release our model, data, and evaluation benchmarks."

            "content": "We extend the Patel et al. (2024b) dataset to nine languages (L): Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Chinese.1 Style Feature Selection We use the set of 40 features addressed in Patel et al. (2024b), leaving out features not applicable to specific languages. For example, articles are not relevant for Chinese and Japanese so the corresponding features have been discarded. Our set of features (F ) includes syntactic features (e.g., active/passive voice, contractions, frequent use of function words), emotional and cognitive features (e.g., words indicating sentiment or cognitive processes), stylistic and aesthetic features (e.g., metaphors, formal tone), social and interpersonal features (e.g., polite or offensive tone), graphical and digital features (e.g., capitalization, emojis, numerical digits), temporal and aspectual features (e.g., focus on present or future).2 Data Generation For each retained feature for language L, we generate 100 pairs of positive (pos) and negative (neg) examples (paraphrases). In each pair, pos is sentence that contains the style feature (e.g., formal sentence or metaphorical one) while neg does not. This is illustrated in Figure 1 for the feature Active Voice. Features that cannot be removed completely (e.g., usage of articles) are present with higher frequency in pos than in neg examples. Using the same prompting workflow as Patel et al. (2024b), we generate sentence pairs by prompting GPT-4 with the DataDreamer library and an attributed prompt (Yu et al., 2023) illustrated in Figure 2 (OpenAI et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2024a). For diversity, Topic for each generation is sampled by extracting random sentence from random document in the C4 corpus (Raffel et al., 2020), and prompting GPT-4 to identify the topic. For further details on all prompts, see Appendix B. We experiment with two approaches to multilingual data generation. In our first approach, sentence pairs are directly generated in each using language-specific instruction in the prompt, as illustrated in Figure 2. In our second approach, English 1These languages were chosen because they align with the linguistic background of our annotators. 2A full list of features and details is given in Appendix A. Generate pair of active and passive Russian sentences with the following attributes: 1. Topic: Brake parts and components 2. Length: 15-20 words 3. Point of view: second-person 4. Tense: past 5. Type of Sentence: Exclamation Figure 2: Example prompt for generating pair of sentences in Russian. sentence pairs are generated using the prompting workflow and then translated into each target language L.3 We generate data using both methods and conduct human validation on random 10% split in order to determine the best approach for each language. Each sentence pair for style feature creates two annotation task instances. For each task instance of given style feature and the positive or negative sentence, we asked annotators4 to provide: 1) judgment on if the style feature is present in the sentence, and 2) rating of the fluency. We only considered instances annotated by at least three annotators. Inter-annotator agreement was α = 0.4247 (Krippendorff, 2011). More details on the annotation can be found in Appendix C. We calculate an aggregate feature presence accuracy score for each by calculating whether the average feature presence score over all annotations is higher for the positive sentence than for the negative sentence in pair.5 We calculate an aggregate fluency score by taking an average of the fluency scores that each annotator gave each text.6 We selected the best approach (direct generation v.s. English MT) for each as the one that produced the most fluent sentences, or the highest feature presence score if both produced similarly fluent generations. The direct approach was selected for all languages in except for Japanese and Hindi. Our final average feature presence and fluency scores over all L, with the best generation approach selected for each l, are 0.79 and 0.93, respectively, both above random chance (0.5). Detailed results by language are given in Appendix D. 3We use DeepL for all languages except for Hindi which is not supported, where we use Google Translate instead. 4MS and undergraduate students native speakers of language, who were offered extra credit for participation. 5We assign 1 for Yes, 0.5 for Possibly, and 0 for No. 6We assign score of 1 for \"Fluent\", 0.67 for Mostly Fluent, 0.33 for Mostly Disfluent, and 0 for Disfluent. 2 Data Validation Following Patel et al. (2024b), we also perform automatic validations of the generated data. We validate whether our parallel examples are indeed paraphrases by computing their average cosine similarity7 (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). For comparison, we calculate the similarity of gold-standard paraphrases in the multilingual dataset compiled by Scherrer (2020)8 for each language. The average similarity of our parallel examples is 0.91 which is comparable to that calculated on the Scherrer (2020) natural data (0.88), indicating that our pairs are reasonable paraphrases. We measure topic diversity across generated sentences for using the metric proposed by Yang et al. (2024) which relies on cosine distance.9 For comparison, we also compute the diversity score for texts from Scherrer (2020). Again, the two scores are comparable (0.83 vs. 0.85), showing that our examples approach the diversity of natural data. Detailed results can be found in Appendix D."

(2024b), we construct feature-specific triples for each language which contain: an anchor text (a); text with the same style as but different content (pos); distractor text (neg) which is paraphrase of or pos, but different in style from a. We use the multilingual xlm-roberta-base as our base model and train with triplet loss (Conneau et al., 2019; Schroff et al., 2015). We ensure half of our triplets are cross-lingual, i.e. the pos and neg texts are randomly sampled from different language than the anchor text. Full training details can be found in Appendix E."

We construct our multilingual SoC benchmark by sampling 100 pairs of parallel pos-neg examples for each language from four 7We use paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2. 8We sample 100 rows of paraphrases from Scherrer (2020). 9In this case, we only evaluate the pos sentence which contains the style feature for each pair. 10The English SoC benchmark covered formality, complexity, number usage, contraction usage, and emoji usage. ground-truth datasets covering four style features and 22 languages: simplicity (Ryan et al., 2023), formality (Briakou et al., 2021), toxicity (Dementieva et al., 2024), and positivity (Mukherjee et al., 2024).11 Each instance in our multilingual SoC benchmark consists of triplet (a, pos, neg) constructed as explained in Section 3. However, following Wegmann et al. (2022), the distractor text in our SoC benchmark is always paraphrase of pos. model tested on this benchmark is expected to embed and pos closer than and neg. We rate model by computing the percent of instances it achieves this goal for across all instances. We form test instances for each in language corresponding to all possible triplets, resulting in 4,950 instances for each language-style combination. We also construct cross-lingual SoC benchmark that addresses embeddings ability to capture style similarity across languages. This can be useful, for example, to evaluate style preservation in translations. We construct the benchmark with the XFormal dataset (Briakou et al., 2021), which includes parallel data in French, Italian and Portuguese. We again create triplets as described above, but instead of using pos and neg texts from the same language as the anchor (a), we sample them from different language than a. We end up with 19,800 instances for each style in each language. Appendix contains illustrative examples from each benchmark. SoC Evaluation Results The results obtained by MSTYLEDISTANCE on the multilingual and crosslingual SoC benchmarks are presented in Table 1. As no general multilingual style embeddings are currently available, we compare with base multilingual encoder model xlm-roberta-base (Conneau et al., 2019) as well as number of English-trained style embedding models applied in zero-shot fashion to multilingual text: Wegmann et al. (2022), STYLEDISTANCE embeddings (Patel et al., 2024b), and LISA (Patel et al., 2023). MSTYLEDISTANCE embeddings outperform these models on multilingual and cross-lingual SoC tasks confirming its suitability for multilingual applications. The other models perform slightly better than the untrained xlm-roberta-base but still worse than MSTYLEDISTANCE. 11Combined, these datasets cover the following languages: Amharic, Arabic, Bengali, German, English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Magahi, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Slovenian, Telugu, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Chinese."

Ablation Experiments Following (Patel et al., 2024b), we run several ablation experiments to evaluate how well our model generalizes to unseen style features and languages. In the In-Domain condition, all style features are included in the training data for every language. To test generalization to unseen style features, in the Out of Domain condition, any style feature directly equivalent to those features tested in the Multilingual and Crosslingual SoC benchmarks are excluded from the training data. Out of Distribution further removes any style features indirectly similar or related to those tested in the benchmarks. Finally, No Language Overlap removes the languages present in the benchmark from the training data, in order to test generalization to new languages. Our results are given in Table 3 where we measure how much of the performance increase on SoC benchmarks over the base model is retained, despite ablating training data. The results indicate that our method generalizes reasonably well to both out of domain and out of distribution style features, and very well to languages not in the training data. Further details on features and languages ablated and full results are provided in Appendices and H. et Downstream Task Following Patel al. (2024b), we also evaluate our MSTYLEDISTANCE embeddings in the authorship verification (AV) task, where the goal is to determine if two documents were written by the same author using stylistic features (Koppel and Winter, 2014). We use the datasets released by PAN12 between 2013 and 2015 in Greek, Spanish, and Dutch. Our results are given in Table 2. MSTYLEDISTANCE vectors outperform existing English style embedding models on Spanish and Greek, while Dutch shows similar performance to English STYLEDISTANCE. the linguistic proximity We hypothesize that (West Germanic roots) of the two languages helps STYLEDISTANCE to generalize to Dutch."

            "content": "Our synthetic data generation approaches rely on direct generation or machine translation techniques, both of which have limitations for languages other than English. Most of the languages included in our multilingual and cross-lingual STEL-orContent and authorship evaluations are not really low-resource, so our evaluations may not reflect performance in languages with less resources. Furthermore, our approach only targets the 33-40 style features (depending on the language) we generated data for, and cannot account for the wide range of possibilities for style. While these drawbacks may limit our approach, our ablation experiments show strong generalization capabilities to unseen languages and style features indicating promising generalized performance."

However, it is important to recognize that the synthetic data generated by large language models may reflect and reinforce existing biases inherent in these models (Patel et al., 2023). While our approach shows significant promise, ongoing efforts should ensure that such synthetic datasets are evaluated for fairness and bias to promote more equitable outcomes."

B.1 Extracting Topics from C4 We use the same topic extraction method as Patel et al. (2024b), which is derived from the C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020), to identify 50,000 topics through zero-shot prompting with GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024). These 50,000 fine-grained, unique topics ensure that each sentence pair has distinct context across various features and languages. We perform topic sampling with temperature setting of 1.0 and top_p = 0.0. What is the fine-grained topic of the following text: {sentence} Only return the topic. The fine-grained topic is used as part of the attributed prompt in Section B.3 to ensure diverse generations. B.2 Generating Positive and Negative Example Sentences for Each Style We use the same prompt as Patel et al. (2024b) to generate positive and negative example sentences in English. We then translate these sentence pairs into the target languages using the DeepL API. The only exception is Hindi, which we translate using Google Translate API due to DeepLs limited language support. B.3 Direct Generating Positive and Negative Example Sentences for Each Style Feature into Target Language For direct generation in target language method (method 2), we use the following prompt with temperature setting of 1.0 and top_p = 1.0 Generate pair of {target language} sentences with and without sarcasm with the following attributes: 1. Topic: {topic} 2. Length: {sentence_length} 3. Point of view: {point_of_view} 4. Tense: {tense} 5. Type of Sentence: {sentence_type} Ensure that the generated sentences meet the following conditions: 1. There is no extra information in one sentence that is not in the other. 2. The difference between the two sentences is subtle. 3. The two sentences have the same length. {special_conditions_for_style_feature} Use Format: With sarcasm: [sentence in {target language}] Without sarcasm: [sentence in {target language}] Your response should only consist of the two sentences, without quotation marks."

We show above in Figure 3 an instance from the human annotation interface. We first asked annotators whether given style feature was present in sentence in their chosen language. We also provided definition for each style feature to help annotators in their decision. The annotators then had to rate the fluency of the sentence be selecting one of Fluent, Mostly Fluent, Mostly Disfluent, or Disfluent. Our annotators are undergraduate and graduate students from NLP class and were offered extra credit for their participation in the study. Each instance was annotated by at least three annotators: three for languages with fewer native speakers such as Arabic and Russian; over ten for languages with large number of native speakers, such as Chinese.

The presence of these symbols in text indicates the use of this style feature. Nominalizations refer to the use of verbs, adjectives, or adverbs as nouns in sentence. This style feature is often used to make sentences more concise or formal. For example, \"the investigation of the crime\" is nominalization of \"investigate the crime\". The text style feature \"Frequent Usage of Function Words\" refers to the regular use of words that have little meaning on their own but work in combination with other words to express grammatical relationships.

These words include \"I\", \"you\", \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"we\", and \"they\". The presence of these words in text can indicate more personal or direct style of communication. \"Fluency in Sentence Construction\" refers to the smoothness and ease with which sentences are formed and flow together. It involves using correct grammar, appropriate vocabulary, and logical connections between ideas. text with this feature would read smoothly, without abrupt changes or awkward phrasing. The usage of only uppercase letters style feature refers to the practice of writing all the letters in text in capital letters.

These sentences often include dependent clauses, which are parts of the sentence that cant stand alone as complete thought, alongside independent clauses, which can stand alone. In simpler terms, if sentence has more than one part and these parts are linked together in way that they give more detailed information or express multiple thoughts, it has complex sentence structure. Positive Sentiment Expression is text style feature that refers to the use of words, phrases, or expressions that convey positive or optimistic viewpoint or emotion. This could include expressions of happiness, joy, excitement, love, or any other positive feelings. The text is considered to have this feature if it makes the reader feel good or positive after reading it.

The style feature \"usage of only lowercase letters\" refers to the practice of writing all words in text with small letters only, without using any capital letters. This means that even the first word of sentence, proper nouns, or the pronoun are not capitalized. Its like writing whole text without ever pressing the shift key on your keyboard.
