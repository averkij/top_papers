            "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) allows models to continuously improve their decisions or responses through interactions with an environment, guided by the goal of maximizing feedback rewards. This dynamic learning paradigm has recently demonstrated strong potential in pushing large language models (LLMs) beyond the limitations of static training. Recently, OpenAI-o1 [Jaech et al., 2024] and DeepSeek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025] have demonstrated that RL can significantly enhance the complex reasoning abilities of LLMs. Subsequently, productive line of research has successfully leveraged RL to improve open-weight models on tasks such as mathematical reasoning [Zeng et al., 2025a, Yu et al., 2025, Hu et al., 2025]. Reward systems used in this context are mostly rule-based verifiers, which assess whether model outputs match the ground-truth answer using hand-crafted, programmatic criteria. Intuitively, rulebased verification has inherent limitations and may fail to capture correct answers expressed in different formats, especially for longer ones. However, despite their widespread use, the limitations Equal Contribution. Correspondence to Yuzhen Huang (yhuanghj@cse.ust.hk), Weihao Zeng (wzengak@connect.ust.hk), and Junxian He (junxianh@cse.ust.hk).

Left illustrates the evaluation accuracy averaged over multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, Minerva Math, OlympiadBench, AIME24, and AMC23. Right depicts changes in reward values during training. The training rewards indicate the rewards provided by the corresponding reward system to the policy model, whereas the oracle rewards represent rewards the model receives when judged by combining with GPT-4o. We provide detailed breakdown of evaluation results in Table 2. of rule-based verification in previous RL practices remain poorly understood. For example, how accurate is rule-based verification in those RL projects? Does incorrect verification significantly influence RL performance? In this work, we first seek to address these two questions by conducting comprehensive analysis of existing rule-based verifiers across several widely used open-source mathematical datasets for RL. In static, classification-based evaluations, our results show that while rule-based verifiers are highly effective at recognizing correct answers when the responses closely match the ground-truth format, notable failures occur when the generated answers are more diverse or fall into long-tail distributions, leading to average recall rate of only 86%, which means 14% of correct responses are classified as incorrect. More concerning is the clear trend of increasing false negative rates as the generation model becomes stronger, signaling potential risk as we advance to more capable models. To address this issue and assess whether more accurate verifiers can enhance RL performance, we further investigate model-based verifiers by leveraging off-the-shelf open-weight models as well as training new ones. We find that model-based verifiers significantly outperform rule-based verifiers in classification-based evaluations for example, improving the recall rate from 84% to 92% on the Skywork-OR1 dataset [He et al., 2025]. In our subsequent RL training experiments, however, we observe that model-based verifiers introduce unique challenges and yield mixed outcomes: while some verifiers can improve RL results by an average of more than 3 absolute points over rule-based verifiers, others are vulnerable to hacking, leading to suboptimal results of RL training(see the left side of Figure 1). Reward hacking well-known issue in RL refers to the exploitation of specific patterns by the policy model to deceive the reward system and obtain artificially high rewards (illustrated in the bottom right of Figure 1). Notably, we find that our trained verifier, despite achieving higher classification accuracy than offthe-shelf alternatives, is more susceptible to hacking during RL training. These findings indicate that the classification accuracy of verifier does not necessarily reflect its resistance to reward hacking, and therefore may not be reliable indicator of its effectiveness in RL training. In the final part of our study, we conduct pilot investigation into specific patterns that can exploit vulnerabilities in verifiers. We construct range of adversarial patterns inspired by our case studies, such as the insertion of empty characters or garbled text. Using these constructed hacking data, we evaluate whether various model-based verifiers can be deceived. Our results show that most verifiers are easily fooled by these patterns and the discriminative verifiers are more robust than the generative ones. While fine-tuning improves static evaluation scores, it does not necessarily enhance robustness and, in some cases, even worsens it an observation consistent with our RL experimental findings. 2 Our findings in this work clearly identify the pitfalls of both rule-based and model-based verifiers in the context of mathematical reasoning: current rule-based verifiers are not sufficiently accurate even for widely used open-source mathematical datasets with short answers that should be easily verifiable. Pursuing more accurate model-based verifiers is promising direction to improve RL performance; however, this approach introduces unique vulnerabilities to hacking, which require further investigation in future work."

            "title": "2 Preliminaries",
            "content": "Recent research demonstrates that reinforcement learning (RL) using verifiable problems such as mathematical problems with ground-truth answers can substantially enhance models reasoning abilities [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025, Team et al., 2025, Seed et al., 2025]. In this study, we follow this RL with verifiable reward (RLVR) training paradigm to examine the strengths and limitations of different verifiers. Below we provide short introduction to the preliminary context. RL with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). The goal of RL is to maximize the cumulative rewards the model receives from its environment during training [Sutton et al., 1998]. When training on verifiable problems such as math or code tasks with definitive answers the correctness of the models output can be automatically evaluated by verifier. This verifier checks whether the models predicted answer matches the known ground-truth answer and assigns corresponding reward. This paradigm has been widely used to boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs such as in Tulu3 [Lambert et al., 2024], DeepSeek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025], and Kimi-k1.5 [Team et al., 2025]. Rule-based Verifier is system that relies on large set of manually written equivalence rules to determine whether predicted answer matches the ground truth. Rule-based verifiers have been dominantly employed to develop mathematical reasoning recently [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025, Team et al., 2025, Zeng et al., 2025a, Yu et al., 2025], yet its potential limitations are under-explored. For example, writing comprehensive rule sets is time-consuming and requires domain expertise, and even the most carefully crafted rules often fail to cover edge cases for instance, mathematically equivalent expressions under certain context (e.g., 0.5π vs. 90 in geometry). Moreover, rule-based verifiers struggle to interpret semantic context, such as variations in units (e.g., 3 hours vs. 180 minutes). As result, they may incorrectly reject correct answers that are expressed differently. How accurate are rule-based verifiers in the widely used mathematical reasoning context? How would the verification errors affect RL training performance? We investigate these questions next."

            "title": "3 Are Verifiers Trustworthy? From a Static Evaluation Perspective",
            "content": "In this section, we study verifiers in static, classification-based evaluation setting, where the verifiers are provided with generated responses and ground-truth answers, and asked to judge whether the generated response is correct. We first curate our own evaluation dataset and reveal the limitations of current rule-based verifiers, and then we study model-based verifiers as potential remedy. 3.1 Evaluation Dataset Construction We curate our dataset as static classification task to examine the capabilities of verifiers in classifying the correctness of model responses with respect to provided ground-truth answer. The curation process involves three main steps: First, we select and sample from four mathematical RL datasets Math [Hendrycks et al., 2021], DeepscaleR [Luo et al., 2025a], Open-Reasoner-Zero (ORZ-Math)[Hu et al., 2025], and Skywork-OR1[He et al., 2025] with 1,000 queries sampled from each dataset. In the second step, we generate two responses for each of these queries using two types of language models: (1) Short-CoT models, specifically Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct [Yang et al., 2024a] and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [Yang et al., 2024b], and (2) R1-style long CoT models, namely DeepseekR1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 32B [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025]. Finally, we employ GPT-4o [Hurst et al., 2024] as an annotator to provide ground-truth annotations based on the response and target answer, on whether the models response aligns with the target answer, based on prompt shown in Figure 4 in Appendix A. The final dataset comprises 2,000 examples per dataset, for total of 8,000 examples. We emphasize that the datasets we selected already represent relatively easy setting for verification these datasets contain only short answers, and most were specifically curated to be easily verifiable 3 Figure 2: Recall rates of various rule-based verifiers across multiple datasets, evaluated on subset sampled from Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen32B. VERL, Qwen, and HF refer to the Verl Math Verifier, Qwen-Math Verifier, and Hugging Face Math Verifier, respectively. Figure 3: Recall Rate of the Huggingface Math Verifier, evaluated on data sampled from various models across different RL training datasets. DS stands for Deepseek, while Skywork refers to the Skywork-OR1 dataset. by rules in order to facilitate RL. Consequently, more realistic scenarios are likely to present greater challenges than those reflected in our empirical results next. Justification of GPT-4o annotation. As we utilize GPT-4o to obtain ground-truth annotations for scalable test, here we conduct human evaluation to justify GPT-4o as the annotator. Concretely, we sample 50 examples from each dataset, totaling 200 examples. Then two human annotators participate in the human annotation. The human annotators are provided with the models response and the target answer, and they are asked to judge whether the models response is correct. We assess the consistency between human annotation and GPT-4os annotations and aggregate the results by averaging. The consistency between GPT-4o and the human annotators is high with Cohens Kappa of 0.933 and F1 score of 0.983, which demonstrates that GPT-4os judgments are reasonably accurate. 3.2 Rule-based Verifiers: Precision at the Cost of Recall Setup. We adopt three popular rule-based verifier implementations including: (1) Verl Math Verifier,2 (2) Qwen-Math Verifier,3 and (3) HuggingFace Math Verifier,4 which have been widely utilized in previous studies [Zeng et al., 2025b,a, He et al., 2025, Yu et al., 2025]. High Precision at the Cost of Recall. To evaluate the performance of these verifiers, we test them on subset of data sampled from Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, state-of-the-art open-source model known for its exceptional mathematical reasoning abilities. As shown in Table 5 in Appendix B, all three verifiers exhibit near-perfect precision, consistently achieving over 99% precision. This means that if an answer passes the rules, it is almost certainly correct because the rule-based verifiers rely on deterministic programming language logic and computation. Notably, the HuggingFace Math Verifier and Qwen-Math Verifier show very similar performance. However, the rigid structure of these rule-based systems presents challenges when dealing with more complex or edge-case queries, leading to significantly low recall rate of 0.78 on some datasets like Skywork-OR1, as shown in Figure 2. This indicates that there are some correct responses that are misjudged as incorrect, and we illustrate some cases in Figure 5. Challenges in Verifying Advanced Models. Figure 3 presents the recall rate of HuggingFace Math Verifier across various sampling models and datasets. key observation is that as the capabilities of the models increase, providing accurate supervision becomes more challenging for rule-based verifiers. For example, the recall rate for the Long-CoT models, such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen7B and 32B averages around 0.92, which is much lower than other weaker models. This is because some complex queries, which only advanced models can solve, are misjudged by the rule-based verifier. The inability of rule-based verifiers underlines the difficulty in verifying highly capable models. This trend is particularly concerning, given that the community is advancing increasingly powerful reasoning models, which in turn require stronger verifiers. 2https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/verl/utils/reward_score/math.py 3https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math/blob/main/evaluation/evaluate.py 4https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify 4 Table 1: The performance of various model-based verifiers across different datasets is presented, with results shown in terms of Precision/Recall. To assess model-based verifiers within hybrid verifier framework, we evaluate subset sampled from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and exclude examples already verified as correct by the HuggingFace Math Verifier. As result, the HuggingFace verifier shows zero metrics here, since it classifies all remaining examples as incorrect.

As shown in Figure 2, more challenging datasets tend to have lower recall rates. For example, the Math dataset, known for its simplicity and well-established structure, results in relatively high recall rate, while newer and more difficult datasets, such as Skywork-OR1, experience significantly lower recall rates. These findings underscore critical limitation: As datasets become more varied, and more challenging, the reliability of rule-based verifiers as supervision tools for scalable reinforcement learning diminishes. 3.3 Model-based Verifiers: Toward Greater Flexibility To mitigate the limitation of rule-based verifiers, we next investigate model-based verifiers as potential alternative. Model-based verifiers seek to leverage the core capabilities of LLMs, including their advanced reasoning skills, to produce more accurate judgments. They are, in principle, better equipped to evaluate answers presented in diverse formats. Model-based verifiers are explored in several concurrent works [Su et al., 2025, Ma et al., 2025, Seed et al., 2025] without deep discussion or ablation on their strengths and limitations. As such, the potential benefits of model-based verifiers over rule-based ones in the context of RL remain unclear. Additionally, model-based verifiers, especially generative ones, introduce significant computational overhead, which can be critical for online RL training. In this section, we first explore model-based verifiers in static evaluation, and in 4 we will discuss its effect in RL training. Setup. We evaluate two categories of general LLM as verifier: (1) Short-CoT models: Qwen2.5instruct (1.5B and 7B) [Yang et al., 2024b] and Qwen2.5-Math-instruct (1.5B and 7B) [Yang et al., 2024a]. (2) R1-style long-CoT models: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B and 7B) [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025]. We will also discuss model-based verifiers specifically trained for verification tasks in 5. Note that we focus on models with up to 7B parameters, as larger models are neither practical nor efficient for scaling RL training. We note that all these models are generative which will typically generate reasoning traces along with the final judgment. Since rule-based verifiers achieve nearly perfect precision but tend to produce false negatives, we focus here exclusively on the examples that rule-based verifiers classify as incorrect. This approach is able to better distinguish different model-based verifiers. It also aligns with the design of our hybrid verification system in the RL experiments, where rule-based verifiers are applied first, and model-based verifiers are used only for those cases deemed incorrect. We will provide further details in 4.1. Specifically, for the evaluation dataset, we use the subset sampled from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, excluding examples that have already been classified as correct by the HuggingFace Math Verifier. For additional details about the evaluation procedure, please refer to Appendix C. 5 Performance. As shown in Table 1, the Long-CoT language models demonstrate strong potential as verifiers, even without task-specific fine-tuning. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves an average precision of 0.79 and recall rate of 0.59, contributing to an overall improvement in the verifier systems recall. The test cases in this subset are often non-trivial as illustrated in Figure 7 with answers requiring complex transformations and calculations to establish equivalence. Such scenarios would be costly and complex to handle with manually crafted rules. However, the model-based verifier, aided by the CoT process, successfully handles these complex cases. Moreover, larger model sizes contribute to better performance, as their enhanced mathematical capabilities allow them to tackle more sophisticated problems. For the model specifically trained for verification tasks, we will discuss them in 5."

            "title": "4 The Effect of Verifiers on RL Training",
            "content": "In 3, we showed that model-based verifiers achieve strong performance across datasets and substantially improve recall on the verification task. Building on this, we adopt model-based verifiers in RL training and compare their impact with rule-based verifiers. Specifically, we propose hybrid verifier that integrates the strengths of both approaches. We first evaluate its performance in static settings, then analyze its improvements over rule-based verifiers in RL training, as well as its training efficiency compared to fully model-based verifiers. 4.1 The Hybrid Verifier Designs. In the hybrid design, the rule-based verifier first classifies responses, and the model-based verifier provides supplementary judgment only when the rule-based verifier flags response as incorrect. This design leverages the strengths of both methods: maintaining high precision through the rule-based verifier while improving recall with the model-based verifier. Static Evaluation. In Table 6 in Appendix D, we present the static evaluation results of the rulebased verifiers, the model-based verifiers, and the hybrid verifiers. The hybrid verifier improves recall by approximately 3 percentage points on average over the rule-based verifier, while consistently maintaining precision above 98%. Model-based verifiers alone may exhibit lower recall than the hybrid approach, as smaller models can overthink some straightforward cases. However, integrating the rule-based verifier mitigates this issue, resulting in superior overall performance. In general, the hybrid system achieves superior performance in both precision and recall. Furthermore, by filtering out straightforward cases that the rule-based verifier can confidently resolve, the hybrid design substantially reduces the computational load on the model-based verifier. We discuss this further in 4.3. 4.2 Experimental Setup For all experiments, we follow the approach of Deepseek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025], using GRPO [Shao et al., 2024] as the training algorithm and adhering to the zero RL training recipe starting training directly from the base model. Our policy model is Qwen2.5-7B Base [Yang et al., 2024b]. We conduct RL training using the DeepscaleR dataset and construct hybrid verifier by combining the Huggingface Math Verifier with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, the best-performing 1.5B model on DeepscaleR, as shown in Table 1. Further training details are provided in Appendix Benchmarks. We build our evaluation script based on Yang et al. [2024a], which utilize the rule-based verifier. And we evaluate performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], MATH 500 [Hendrycks et al., 2021], OlympiadBench [He et al., 2024] and Minerva Math [Lewkowycz et al., 2022], as well as on competition-level benchmarks including AIME 2024 and AMC 2023. Following the approach in [Zeng et al., 2025a, Yu et al., 2025], we evaluate AIME 2024 by averaging the results of 32 random samplings (Avg@32) to ensure stable evaluation.

As shown in Figure 1, the inclusion of the hybrid verifier significantly improves the accuracy of evaluation with the peek point of 58.35, more than 3 points higher than that of using rule-based verifier only. Moreover, the hybrid verifier boosts dataset utilization by reducing the proportion of answers that cannot be correctly parsed. For instance, as shown in Table 2, the performance of the rule-based verifier is nearly identical to that of our baseline, SimpleRL-Zoo [Zeng et al., 2025a], which uses training data that is 10 times smaller and less challenging. However, after integrating the model-based verifier, there is substantial improvement in performance. Training Efficiency. Compared to rule-based verifier, the hybrid verifier incorporates generative language model into the verification process, increasing verification time during training. However, the HybridEngines design (detailed in Appendix E) allows for substantial increase in GPU utilization, keeping the overhead at an acceptable level. Moreover, the design of our hybrid verifier allows the model-based verifiers workload to be further reduced. Evaluation Results using GPT-4o. Since we have identified the issue of inaccurate judgments by rule-based verifiers, relying on them at inference time as is common in most previous works may disadvantage RL training when model-based verifiers are used. Therefore, we also report evaluation results using GPT-4o as the verifier.. As shown in Table 3, most results are similar to those obtained using the rule-based verifier  (Table 2)  , and the conclusions drawn from the latter remain valid. However, notable exception occurs with the Minerva Math benchmark, where significant performance gap of 13 points is observed on the Qwen2.5-7B base model when GPT-4o is used as the evaluation verifier (Table 2 vs. Table 3). This suggests that the limitations of rule-based verifiers extend even to well-established benchmarks, highlighting the need for more sophisticated verifiers in certain cases to ensure accurate evaluation."

We incorporate dedicated open-source verifiers explicitly fine-tuned for verification tasks, including: (1) xVerify 0.5B and 3B [Chen et al., 2025], fine-tuned on approximately 190K examples from multiple benchmarks; (2) general-verifier 1.5B[Ma et al., 2025], trained on wide range of disciplines, including mathematics. (3) R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B, custom verifier we develop through rejection fine-tuning [Yuan et al., 2023] as detailed in Appendix G. The objective of this training is to reduce overthinking and encourage the model to generate more concise and focused outputs. It is worth noting that xVerify is discriminative verifier, meaning it directly outputs final judgment without intermediate reasoning. In contrast, other verifiers are generative, producing chain-of-thought reasoning process before arriving at their final decision. For all trained verifiers, we apply an improved prompting strategy that includes the original question to provide additional context for verification. The static evaluation results for these verifiers are summarized in Table 1. Static evaluation does not reflect long-term RL training. As shown in Table 1, off-the-shelf verifiers trained on large-scale datasets significantly outperform general-purpose models. Among them, general-verifier achieves the highest performance, with precision of 0.90 and recall of 0.86. However, Table 2 reveals that the performance gap between the general-verifier model and DS-R1Distill-Qwen-1.5B model is relatively small. This suggests that strong static evaluation metrics do not necessarily translate into superior performance during long-term RL training. Furthermore, our trained verifier, R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B, also shows substantial gains over its base model, improving average recall from 0.49 to 0.62 and precision from 0.68 to 0.73 in static evaluation. Intuitively, we expect these improvements to translate into superior performance during dynamic RL training. However, we observe counterintuitive phenomenon: as shown in the bottom right of Figure 1, after long-term RL training, the training reward experiences significant surge at around 450 iterations. This anomaly leads us to investigate the occurrence of reward hacking, where the model optimizes for the reward signal in unintended ways that do not align with genuine performance improvements. 5.2 Verifier Under Siege: Reward Hacking in RL Training Oracle Reward Annotation. To assess whether the rule-based or hybrid verifier provides an accurate reward signal and to detect potential reward hacking, we employ GPT-4o [Hurst et al., 2024] as an oracle during RL training. At each saved checkpoint, we randomly sample 1,000 queries from the training data, generate responses, and evaluate their correctness using GPT-4o. We then calculate the corresponding oracle reward. By analyzing the deviation between the training reward and the oracle reward, we gain valuable insights into both the effectiveness of the verifiers and the occurrence of reward hacking. Reward Hacking in Dynamic Training. Figure 1 (Right) plots the training reward against the oracle reward for different verifiers during RL training on DeepscaleR. Notably, after approximately 450 training iterations, the training reward using R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B diverges significantly from the oracle reward provided by GPT-4o, while other methods maintain close alignment. This indicates that despite its strong static performance, R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B becomes compromised during dynamic RL training, leading to drop in evaluation accuracy and eventual training collapse, as shown in Figure 1 (Left). In contrast, the untrained verifier, R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B, and the rule-based verifier do not exhibit such instability. These findings motivate our further investigation into verifier robustness in 6. Hacking Pattern Analysis. Through analysis of the hacking phenomena, we observed that most of the attacks targeting R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B fall into two patterns: Single Symbol and Gibberish. As shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 in Appendix H, the policy model exploits vulnerabilities in the verifier during training by outputting either single simple character (such as { ) or long sequences of meaningless text to bypass the verifier. Our observations are consistent with those of Baker et al. [2025], indicating that although introducing model-based verifier effectively increases the verifiers flexibility, it implicitly raises the complexity of the environment and consequently reduces its robustness. Therefore, studying and improving the robustness of verifiers is of critical importance. 8 Table 4: Success rates (%) of representative hacking patterns against verifiers. lower success rate indicates that the model is less susceptible to hacking pattern attacks (i.e., lower is better). This table presents the success rates of selected representative hacking patterns, along with the overall average success rate.

            "content": "In 5, we find that static evaluation on the verification task fails to capture the verifiers influence on long-term RL. Moreover, the trained verifier becomes increasingly vulnerable to hacking patterns over time. To better understand this vulnerability, we now perform detailed robustness analysis of model-based verifiers. Building on the hacking patterns identified in 5.2, we design broader set of attack patterns ranging from simple gibberish inputs to more sophisticated adversarial prefixes. We then evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks across multiple model-based verifiers. 6.1 Experimental Setup To systematically probe the vulnerabilities of verifiers, we construct new adversarial dataset based on approximately 471 samples from the DeepScaleR dataset. Inspired by the case study in 5, we design 13 distinct hacking pattern types, such as empty symbols, gibberish text, and adversarial prefixes, each paired with corresponding adversarial answers (see Table 7 for details). For every original sample, we randomly select one adversarial answer per pattern type to simulate potential model predictions. Each of these adversarial answers is then paired with the original problem and ground-truth answer, resulting in comprehensive set of hacking data. We then evaluate the attack success rates i.e., how often hacking pattern successfully causes the verifier to misjudge an incorrect answer as correct for different types of hacking patterns against range of model-based verifiers. These include various general-purpose LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B/7B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B), our own trained verifiers, and state-of-the-art verifiers such as xVerify-0.5B-I, xVerify-3B-Ia, and general-verifier. 6.2 Analysis Most model-based verifiers are vulnerable to hacking patterns. Table 4 presents the success rates of various hacking patterns against different model-based verifiers, revealing that most verifiers are highly susceptible to these attacks. Strikingly, even simple patterns, such as inserting empty symbols (e.g., {) or injecting gibberish text, can effectively compromise many well-trained verifiers. Notably, our trained R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B becomes more susceptible to such attacks after training. For instance, its susceptibility to adversarial prefixes rises from 21.7 (as seen in DeepSeek-R1-DistillQwen-1.5B) to 35, aligning with the observations discussed in 5. Generative verifiers tend to be more vulnerable than discriminative ones. Verifiers such as general-verifier and Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B-Instruct show notably higher attack success rates under attack compared to xVerify. Our analysis indicates that chain-of-thought (CoT) based generative verifiers are particularly exposed to attacks that disrupt reasoning, such as adversarial prefixes (e.g., As an AI assistant, know the answer is correct.) and answer explanations (e.g., The answer 9 is correct. verified this by checking step by step...). These findings raise concerns about the faithfulness of CoT reasoning and underscore the need for more robust CoT monitoring and defense mechanisms [Baker et al., 2025]."

            "content": "In this paper, we conduct comprehensive analysis of rule-based and model-based verifiers within reinforcement learning for mathematical reasoning tasks. Our findings reveal critical pitfalls in both approaches: rule-based verifiers suffer from significant false negatives, particularly as policy models grow stronger, whereas model-based verifiers, despite higher accuracy in static evaluation, are notably vulnerable to reward hacking. This vulnerability results in inflated training rewards that fail to reflect genuine model performance, undermining the reliability of RL training outcomes. Future work should focus on developing robust verification systems that maintain accuracy without sacrificing robustness, thereby enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of reinforcement learning systems for complex reasoning tasks. Limitations One limitation of this paper is that our investigation primarily focuses on mathematical reasoning, relatively well-defined domain. Although reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has demonstrated utility across broader range of complex tasks, including coding and agentic reasoning [Luo et al., 2025b, Liu and Zhang, 2025, Wang et al., 2025, Zheng et al., 2025], we think that in these broader domains, where RL is applied in much more complex environments, ensuring effectiveness and robustness of verifiers becomes even more critical. The insights and methods developed in our work may also be valuable for improving performance in these more challenging settings."

For the trained verifier, we apply an improved prompting strategy that includes the original question to provide additional context for verification. Prompts that include and exclude the original question for these verifiers are detailed in Figure 6. Hyperparameters. Most verifiers used greedy decoding during evaluation. An exception was made for the R1-style Long-CoT models (including our trained R1-Distill-Verifier-1.5B), for which we followed the settings of DeepSeek-AI et al.

HybridEngine efficiently partitions models and dynamically switches between training and inference modes, significantly improving GPU utilization and reducing communication overhead during RL training. Building on this capability, we extend HybridEngine to the model-based verifier, allowing it to be offloaded from GPUs during idle periods. For alternative implementations such as assigning the verifier to dedicated GPUs or deploying it as standalone server [Su et al., 2025, Ma et al., 2025] we minimize contention between the policy model and the model-based verifier, further enhancing GPU efficiency. Training. We train our models using the Verl framework [Sheng et al., 2024]. The Training uses prompt batch size of 1,024, generating 8 rollouts per prompt with maximum rollout length of 8,192 tokens. We apply mini-batch size of 256 for updates.

And we conduct detailed analysis to the patterns that lead to hacking. As shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the policy model exploits vulnerabilities in the verifier during training by outputting either single simple character (such as { ) or long sequences of meaningless text to bypass the verifier."

We include 13 distinct hacking pattern types as shown in Table 7. I.2 Detailed Results We present the detailed results of the hacking patterns against verifiers in Table 8 and Table 9. 16 Figure 7: Example where DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B correctly identifies the equivalence between Ground Truth and Predicted Answer. Figure 8: The training and evaluation curves of RL using general-verifier, with the x-axis representing training iterations in all plots. Left illustrates the evaluation accuracy averaged over multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, Minerva Math, OlympiadBench, AIME24, and AMC23. Right depicts changes in reward values during training. The training rewards indicate the rewards provided by the corresponding reward system to the policy model, whereas the oracle rewards represent rewards the model receives when judged by combining with GPT-4o. We provide detailed breakdown of evaluation results in Table 2. 17 Figure 9: Example where R1-Verifier-1.5B is hacked by single simple character (such as {) and misjudge it as correct. 18 Figure 10: Examples where R1-Verifier-1.5B is hacked by long sequence of gibberish text.
