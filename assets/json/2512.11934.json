INTRODUCTION intelligence The Generative artificial (GenAI) has reshaped education, advancing digital transformation in eteaching through enhanced personalization, accessibility, and efficiency [1]. GenAI supports dynamic features such as automated tutoring and adaptive assessments, as seen in the rise of AI-integrated educational apps (ed-apps) on platforms 1. https://play.google.com/ implications such as the Google Play Store1, addressing needs ranging from homework assistance to language learning [4]. Yet, key gap remains in grasping user perceptions in real-world use. This study fills this gap through sentiment analysis of user reviews, uncovering strengths, challenges, and for equitable e-teaching. Recent surveys reveal varying AI adoption in education, highlighting opportunities and barriers. Students brainstorming, efficiencies summarizing, and feedback [2]. Educators focus on strategic uses such as lesson ideas, plans, and simplifying topics [2]. This divergence reflects students' productivity needs versus teachers' pedagogical emphasis. However, most K-12 teachers remain non-users due to concerns like integrity, training, and hurdles [3], [5], [6]. Despite challenges, dedicated minority drives momentum for personalized learning, underscoring the need for empirical insights to bridge gaps [7], [8]. prioritize like insights User perceptions are crucial, revealing satisfaction, ethical, usability, and inclusivity issues in AI's digital transformation role [9], [10]. Traditional evaluations via surveys or interviews are limited by sample size and subjectivity [11]. Instead, app store reviews provide scalable, real-time into authentic experiences, including sentiments on accuracy, monetization, and integration [12]. This study uses NLP techniquesRoBERTa for sentiment classification and GPT4o/GPT-5 for theme extractionto analyze reviews from 21 top AI ed-apps [13]. Apps are categorized into seven types: AI Quiz & Question Generators, All-in-One Study Companions, Homework Solvers, Document/Content Tools, Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Language Learning Apps, highlighting multifunctional overlaps and feedback trends. Math-Focused Helpers, The primary objectives are threefold: (1) quantify sentiment distributions and distill key positive/negative themes across app categories; (2) compare performance trends, showing why homework helpers receive high praise while LMS and language apps face criticism; and (3) discuss implications for future AI educational ecosystems, proposing hybrid models integrating AI strengths with human oversight. This analysis contributes data-driven recommendations for developers (e.g., enhancing adaptive personalization) and policymakers (e.g., regulating monetization for inclusivity), like VR/AR for while addressing untapped potentials immersive it underscores GenAI's dual-edged impact: democratizing education via accessible tools but risking over-reliance, inequities, and ethical dilemmas if not refined based on user insights [6], [11]. learning [1], [4]. Ultimately, The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 details the methodology, Section 4 presents the results, Section 5 discusses the findings, including future implications, and Section 6 concludes. II. RELATED WORK GenAI integration in education has drawn attention for its applications, adoption, and teaching implications. Mittal et al. [1] review its role in e-teaching, including content automation, personalized learning, and admin support; categories include adaptive tutoring, assessment automation, and collaborative platforms; benefits: enhanced accessibility; risks: bias and reduced critical thinking. Alfarwan [4] systematically reviews GenAI in K-12, highlighting use cases like automated feedback and simulations, but notes limited long-term efficacy evidence due to early adoption. emphasize pedagogy for diverse needs, requiring training to enhance integration. Figure 2. Distribution of teachers' engagement with AI tools in teaching Figure 2 from RAND survey [3] reveals teachers' AI engagement: 66% non-users (44% aware but unused in teaching, 13% outside use, 9% unaware). Active users (34%) comprise 15% sporadic triers, 8% proactive seekers, and 11% regular users/recommenders [3]. Caution arises from barriers like training gaps, integrity issues, and constraints, though the minority advances personalized learning and efficiency. Ellis et al. [5] qualitatively examine user experiences, noting GenAIs mix of helpful lesson design support and accuracy issues, and emphasize the need for professional development. Further studies explore GenAI's applications and user perceptions in higher education. Gabay et al. [6] review GenAI for academic writing, noting benefits like idea generation and editing, but challenges including ethics and misinformation. Vrågård et al. [7] survey educators on GenAI's effects on learning, highlighting integrity and cheating concerns and assessment redesign opportunities. Hu et al. [8] propose \"Socratic Playground\" framework for inquiry-based learning via interactive platforms, though user feedback [9] assess limited. Haroud and Saqri teacher/student views, finding GenAI supports (not replaces) roles, with digital literacy key. Sousa and Cardoso [10] examine for summarization but motivations favoring convenience over deep learning. Mazaheriyan and Nourbakhsh [11] evaluate ethical issues, revealing time-saving drives bounded by authenticity and equity concerns. showing high student use, adoption is Despite these advancements, gaps persist in sentimentdriven evaluations of AI educational apps, particularly through large-scale user review analysis. While prior works rely on surveys or interviews [5], [7], [9], [10], which offer depth but limited scalability, app store reviews provide authentic, voluminous data on real-world perceptions [12]. TweetNLP [12] demonstrates robust NLP for social media sentiment, adaptable to reviews, and GPT-4o [13] enables advanced extraction, yet few studies apply these to ed-apps. This paper addresses these lacunae by conducting sentiment analysis of Google Play Store reviews for top AI ed-apps, categorizing them functionally and distilling themes to inform future Figure 1. Percentages of primary AI use cases among students and educators for different tasks task efficiencies: brainstorming Adoption trends reveal dichotomy between students and educators, per the Microsoft Education report [2]. Students prioritize (37%), summarizing/quick answers (33% each), feedback (32%), study help (30%), writing improvement (26%), presentation visuals (25%), creativity/time management (24% each), skill development/assignment completion (22% each), wellbeing (19%). Educators focus on strategic uses: lesson ideas (31%), lesson plans (29%), simplifying topics/student improvements (24% (23%), accessibility/answering questions/time-saving (21% each), equitable (19%), language/feedback (17% each). Students seek productivity risking over-reliance or plagiarism; educators gains, differentiating experiences instruction student (20%), access each), ecosystems, extending beyond descriptive adoption [1][4] to prescriptive implications for digital transformation.

DISCUSSION The sentiment-driven evaluation of user reviews from top AI educational apps highlights generative AI's promise for transforming e-teaching, while revealing hurdles to adoption. Positive sentiments dominate, with homework helpers like Edu AI and multi-tool apps like Answer.AI excelling in personalized assistance, such as step-by-step explanations and quick problem-solving, aligning with student productivity needs [2]. This mirrors trends where students use AI for brainstorming and summarizing, democratizing resources for self-directed learning amid workloads [2]. Educators lag in adoption but gain from tools like lesson planning, reducing [3]. administrative burdens, and promoting However, negatives like inaccuracies, paywalls, and instability expose gaps in capabilities, raising ethical issues such as overreliance, plagiarism, and digital divides [6], [11]. Lower performers, and Blackboard, demonstrate flaws in specialized features that erode trust and accessibility, especially in under-resourced areas [9]. including Teacher AI inclusivity in personalized These findings provide empirical, scalable insights from real-world reviews, revealing GenAI education apps' strong learningparticularly momentum homework/math tools (85% positive sentiment)by bridging gaps in under-resourced areas, boosting creativity, efficiency, and engagement through gamification and community features [9]. However, multifunctional designs, while driving retention, amplify monetization barriers, ads, crashes, and equity issues, creating double-edged sword that demands refinement for pedagogical alignment and ethical integration [11]. Looking ahead, the data points toward hybrid AI-human models as pivotal evolution, combining app strengths like real-time assistance with teacher oversight to mitigate risks such as inaccuracies and dependency. For example, integrating high-rated features (e.g., Gauth's step-by-step explanations) with human-guided ethical checks could create collaborative systems where AI handles routine tasks, freeing educators for deeper interactions and fostering critical thinking [14], [15]. This hybrid approach addresses the cautious educator adoption by positioning AI as supportive tool rather than replacement, enhancing academic integrity and personalized pathways [5], [7]. Furthermore, untapped technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) offer opportunities for immersive learning, extending beyond current app limitations. VR/AR could simulate real-world scenariossuch as virtual labs for math solvers or interactive quizzes in Kahoot!to bridge gaps in engagement and multimodal inputs, making education more accessible for diverse learners and filling voids in features like offline access or diagram support [16]. Our sentiment trends, with praises for engagement but criticisms of instability, suggest that embedding VR/AR in multifunctional apps could elevate user satisfaction, particularly in STEM and language domains where notation or speech recognition failures persist [8], [9]. and progress To realize this vision, practical roadmap is proposed: Developers should prioritize adaptive personalization (via feedback loops), expand collaborative features (currently underused beyond Kahoot!), mitigate ethical biases, integrate plagiarism detection sustain gamification for engagement, and adopt transparent, equitable monetization (e.g., Mathos AIs ad-free model) instead of aggressive paywalls [11]. Policymakers should regulate for inclusivity by mandating expanded free tiers, multilingual support, accuracy standards, and strong data privacy protections to bridge digital divides [17, 18]. These measures can into equitable, innovative e-teaching platforms accessible to all learners. transform current descriptive tracking, tools VI. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this sentiment-driven evaluation of user reviews from top AI educational apps on the Google Play Store highlights generative AI's transformative potential in eteaching, with positive feedback emphasizing efficiencies in homework assistance, personalization, and engagement especially in homework helpers (averaging 85% positives) while revealing challenges like inaccuracies, monetization barriers, and technical instability that impede equitable adoption. Extending beyond analysis, it proposes hybrid AIhuman models, VR/AR integrations for immersive learning, and roadmap prioritizing adaptive features for developers and regulatory inclusivity for policymakers, offering empirical insights to bridge user-developer gaps and foster ethical refinements, mitigating risks such as dependency and digital divides. These findings advocate shift to collaborative, innovative ecosystems empowering students and educators, guiding future research on longitudinal impacts and crossplatform integrations to democratize high-quality e-learning."
