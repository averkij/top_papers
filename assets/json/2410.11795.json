            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of diffusion models (DMs) [13], accompanied by range of visually stunning generative contents emerging. After surpassing GAN on image synthesis [4], DMs have shown promising algorithm in wide variety of downstream applications such as image synthesis [510], video generation [1119], audio synthesis [2022], 3D rendering and generation [2327] etc., and have emerged as the new state-of-the-art generative models family. Behind these attractive works, the DMs have denser theoretical basis than other generative families such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and lot of previous efforts have focused on sampling procedure [2831], conditional guidance [3235], likelihood maximization [3639] and generalization ability [4042] to improve their efficiency and performance for more powerful generative abilities. Standing on the shoulders of these extensive works on the principles and practices of DMs, we have almost seen DMs become competitive counterpart to LLMs and almost together become the two most brilliant diamonds in the generative AI community today. However, for LLMs, there are already many comprehensive reviews that explain their efforts in efficient architecture design, model training, supervise fine-tuning, preference aligning as well as corresponding applications, but in the field of DMs, existing surveys [4346] still have significant limitation in comprehensive and in-depth summarize these previous principles and practices (refer to Figure. 1), for helping rapid understanding and application in future works. Zhiyuan Ma is the project leader. Corresponding author. Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: The timeline of efficient DMs. Besides, noteworthy trend is that, driven by the advantages of self-attention and deep scalable architecture, LLMs have acquired powerful language emergence capabilities. However, current DMs still face scalability dilemma [47], which will play critical role in supporting large-scale deep generative training and giving rise to emergent abilities [48] similar to LLMs [49]. Representatively, the recent emergence of Sora [50] has pushed the intelligent emergence capabilities of generative models to climax by treating video models as world simulators. While unfortunately, Sora is still closed-source system and the mechanism for the intelligence emergence is still not very clear. In this survey, we aim to present an exhaustive organization of the recent advancements in the rapidly evolving field of efficient DMs to promote the intelligence emergence of generative models, as depicted in Figure.2. We organize the literature in taxonomy consisting of six primary categories, encompassing various aspects of efficient DMs, including principles, efficient architecture, efficient training and fine-tuning, efficient sampling and inference, deployment, and applications. Principle focuses on the dense theoretical foundation of DMs to explain and reveal the essential reasons for its generative effectiveness by sorting out relevant theories, such as dynamic modeling, score matching, latent projecting, and conditional guidance, to promote the development of new theories and guide various efficient generative practices. Efficient Architecture explores the mainstream backbone networks of the DMs, including: U-Net, DiT, U-ViT, MamBa, etc., and analyzes their design structures to compare their respective advantages and disadvantages, in order to guide the emergence of more powerful new deep scalable architectures. Efficient Training and Fine-tuning sorts out the efficient training, finetuning and preference optimization Methods of DMs such as Low Rank Adaption, Consistency Training, Adversarial Training, Adapter Training, etc., and aims to help researchers and developers make appropriate choices for specific low-resource or personalized training tasks. Efficient Sampling and Inference surveys the most commonly used efficient sampling and inference strategies in diffusion models, covering two categories: learning-free and learning-based methods. By comparing their acceleration performance on various generative tasks, we will provide theoretical basis for the study of faster sampling methods. Efficient Deployment summarizes the latest solutions for deploying the current DMs on mobile devices and on the web, which will facilitate the operation of the DMs in various cross-platform, low-resource environments and promote the birth of various applications. 2 Foundational Diffusion Theories and Models(2.1) Reverse-SDE [51], DPMs [1], VDMs [52], DDPM [2], iDDPM [53], DDIM [3], DDRM [54], PNDM [55], INDM [36], D3PM [56], EDM [57], CDM [58] Principles(2) Score-based Matching(2.2) NCSN [59], LSGM [60], Score-SDE [61], SSM [62], ScoreFlow [39], ScoreAppr.

            "content": "Discrete Definition Assuming the data distribution is q(x0), the discrete DMs [1, 2] are defined as forward data perturbation process q(x1:T x0) and learnable reverse denoising process pθ(x0:T ), both of them are implemented based on Markov steps for progressive add-noising or denoising, q(x1:T x0) := (cid:89) t=1 q(xtxt1), pθ(x0:T ) := p(xT ) (cid:89) t=1 pθ(xt1xt). (1) Note that the two symmetric processes are carried out in different fashions. The former leverages an artificially noise-adding scheduler to gradually convert x0 into xT , while the latter usually starts from p(xT ) = (xT ; 0, I) and adopts score matching model sθ (Sec. 2.2) to gradually estimate the posterior distribution pθ(xt1xt) until x0 is predicted. Specifically, they can be described as: q(xtxt1) := (xt; αtxt1, βtI), pθ(xt1xt) := (xt1; µθ(xt, t), σθ(xt, t)). (2) Where αt = 1βt for facilitating computation and expression. The training objective of pθ amounts to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the model, := Eq (cid:2) log pθ(x0)(cid:3) Eq (cid:104) log p(xT ) log (cid:88) pθ(xt1xt) q(xtxt1) (cid:105) = Lvb.

Then they continues to leverage reverse ODE (also dubbed as the Probability Flow (PF) ODE by [61]) for inverted denoising, which retain the same marginal probability densities as the forward SDE. The forward and reverse diffusion process in continuous-time form can be expressed as: dxt = µ(xt, t)dt + σ(t)dwt, dxt dt = µ(xt, t) σ(t)2 (cid:105) (cid:104) log pt(xt) 1 2 (5) where µ(xt, t) and σ(t) are the drift and diffusion coefficient-terms respectively, and {wt}t[0,T ] denotes the standard Brownian motion. Moreover, log pt(xt) denotes the gradient of the loglikelihood of pt(xt), which can be estimated by score matching network sθ(xt, t)."

The core of text-conditional diffusion models is to integrate the semantics of text condition into noise prediction model ϵθ(zt, t) to generate visual contents conforming to text semantics, i.e., ϵθ(zt, t, c). The classifier-free guidance technique has recently been widely adopted in text-guided image generation as, ϵθ(zt, t, c, ) = ϵθ(zt, t, c) + (1 w) ϵθ(zt, t, ) (8) where = 7.5 is default linear parameter for weighting the unconditional guidance objective and conditional guidance objective in Stable Diffusion, is time input, is text condition, denotes null text embedding initialized by zero vector and θ is model parameters. Note that all of these parameters will be individually or jointly optimized for controlled image editing in following variants. Condition-guided Vision Editing. Compared with the condition-guided diffusion models, image editing methods usually own more stringent restrictions, which aim to conduct semantic-guided editing while preserving original pixel characteristics. For ControlNet [9], parameter θ is split into θlocked and θcopy for prior preservation and semantic-guided editing, in which is trained by zero convolution layer and condition is split into text prompt ct and images feature map cf . This variant can be formalized as ϵθlocked,θcopy (zt, t, ct, cf , zero) (variant 1). Then, in order to achieve more accurate editing, Prompt-to-Prompt [153] introduces fixed time hyper-parameter τ to determine when to manipulate the cross-attentive parameters θMt into edited θM , which can be formulated as ϵθ(zt, t, τ, c, c) = ϵθ(θM ,t<τ ; zt, t, τ, c) + (1 w) ϵθ(θMt,tτ ; zt, t, τ, c), where can be viewed as reweight hyper-parameter (variant 2). Afterwards, Null-Text-Inversion [154] optimizes the zero embedding into time-aware embedding with pivot supervision from DDIM inversion process, which can be simply denoted as ϵθ(zt, t, c, t) (variant 3). Later, to further realize the subject-binding and prior preservation, DreamBooth [10] introduces rare token identifiers [V] associated with visual subjects and exploits an additional class-specific prior preservation item for training as ϵθ(zt, t, c, c[V]) = ϵθ(zt, t, c[V]) + λ ϵθ(zt, t, c) (variant 4). Moreover, to enable non-grid editing [155, 156], Imagic [155] optimizes text embedding and leverages an interpolation technique to implement variable guidance, which is controlled by linear hyper-parameter η as ϵθ(zt, t, c) (variant 5), where = η ctgt + (1 η) copt. 5 Figure 3: universal pipeline of the diffusion based models for visual content generation. pretrained VAE (with encoder and decoder structures) compresses the input image or video into latent space. Diffusion models add noise to the latent features and train neural network (e.g. U-Net or Transformer) for de-noising.

            "content": "Diffusion and denoising in high-dimensional RGB pixel space [2, 46, 157] results in an expensive training cost and affects the speed of inference. To make the diffusion model accessible while reducing its significant resource consumption, LDM [33] observes that most bits of an image contribute to perceptual details and retain semantic and conceptual composition even after aggressive compression. LDM removes pixel-level redundancy by training VAE that compresses the input image from the pixel space to the latent space. Then diffusion and denoising are performed in latent space, which significantly reduces the cost of training and reasoning for DMs. Figure 4 illustrates the structure of standard VAEs for image/video compression, which include normal variational auto-encoders (VAEs) [167], quantized VAEs such as VQVAE [65] or VQGAN [66] and their variants [168], where the GAN discriminator loss is added to achieve reconstruction quality for higher compression More importantly, the trained VAE is generalized compression model, and its latent space can be used to train multiple generative models and applied to other downstream tasks. Following the LDM, the posterior image generation approach [169, 158, 8, 170, 73, 171, 74, 75, 81, 159, 161, 80] compresses/decompresses the image in latent space by training VAE using the encoder and decoder of the VAE.

Video contains not only spatial information but also lot of temporal information, so there are more computational challenges in video generation. In addition, the diffusion video generation models exemplified by Sora [163] use VAE to compress the video and then train and reason in latent space. These video generation models [79, 164166] are usually derived from Stable Diffusions image 2D VAEs, since training 3D from scratch is quite challenging.

            "content": "As shown in Figure. 5, the neural networks within the diffusion models mainly serve as residualstyle noise predictors in the de-noising stage [47], which can be categorized into the following mainstream architectures: Figure 5: The mainstream neural network backbones serving as denoisers in diffusion models, which including U-shaped denoising networks (U-Net based and U-ViT based) and F-shaped denoising networks (DiT-based and SSM-based). U-Net based Backbone. DDPM [2] as the seminal work that introduces U-Net [174] as the backbone for the diffusion model to predict the probability distribution at each step of the de-noising process. In which the U-Net follows from PixelCNN++ [175] and utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture, where the spatial pixels of the image are downsampled by convolutional operations at each layer of the encoding process while extracting the features. The spatial resolution is progressively restored in the decoder stage, while the feature information extracted by the encoder and decoder is fused via skip connections. U-Net [174] is capable to process the image features at different scales, which helps in the gradual de-noising process. Specifically, Song et al. [116] improved the performance of unconditional image generation tasks by making further changes for U-net in the Sore-based diffusion model. Prafulla et al. [4] improved the U-Net architecture in the 8 diffusion model by increasing the width and depth of the network, and increasing the number of attention heads, etc., achieved better performance than GAN on the image generation tasks. Other models [157, 32, 6] with U-Net based architectures perform diffusion and denoising directly in highdimensional RGB pixel space, incurring high training costs and affecting the inference speed. Based on the LDM [33], SDXL [8] uses more attention blocks and larger cross-attention context, thus including more parameters in the U-Net. VDM [176] extends LDM to the video generation task by introducing 3D convolutional layers. Transformer based Backbone. Transformer has shown the dominance in the fields of Natural Language Processing [177180], Computer Vision [181] and Multi-modality [182184] with its scalability and ability to model long-range dependencies of the attention mechanism. This trend is also held in many autoregressive image generation models [185, 186]. However, before U-ViT [72] and DiT [73] were proposed, advanced diffusion models for image generation tasks still adopt convolutional U-Net architecture. U-ViT [72] introduced the Transformer Block in U-shaped structure as backbone for diffusion models, which treats all inputs as tokens and utilizes long skip connection between the shallow and deep layers. DiT [73] introduced Vision Transformer [181] as backbone to replace U-Net, and further demonstrates the scalability of Transformer for image generation tasks. Recent works have also demonstrated the superior performance of the diffusion generation model of the DiT architecture for image [81] and video generation tasks [79, 163]. Specifically, PixArtα [81] simplicates computationally intensive class conditional branching in Diffusion Transformer by joining the cross-attention module to inject textual conditions that are encoded through T5 [85]. Latte [79] expands the DiT architecture to the video generation task by extracting spatio-temporal tokens from the input video, and introducing temporal and spatial transformer blocks to model the video distribution in latent spaces, respectively. Futhermore, following DiT, Latte uses AdaLAN for time-step class information injection. Notably, the emergence of Sora [163] demonstrates the substantial scalability of the Transformer architecture for generating high-quality video content. There are number of recent image [159, 80, 162] and video [164, 165, 82, 166, 83] generation models that have also verified the scalability of transformer in diffusion modeling under large-scale training. SSM based Backbone. The transformer-based diffusion models suffer from the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, making them consume huge computational cost for long sequence generation tasks (e.g., high-resolution image synthesis, video generation, etc.). Advances in statespace modeling (SSM) [187, 188] show new direction to achieve trade-off between computational efficiency and model flexibility. Some recent SSM-based approaches [189191] have been proposed and proven their efficiency on multiple tasks and modalities in modeling long sequence dependencies. Mamba [192] combines SSM architectures and proposes hardware-aware algorithms that enable efficient training and inference. DiM [76] introduces Mamba as diffusion backbone for high-resolution image generation. Specifically, DiM avoids unidirectional causality between patches by designing the Mamba block to perform the four scanning directions alternately. In consideration of the lack of spatial continuity in mamba scanning schemes, ZigMa [77] allows mamba blocks applicable to 2D images by incorporating continuity-based inductive bias in the images. In addition by performing spatio-temporal decomposition of 3D sequences, which is extended to video generation task. In addition to the above types of mainstream diffusion model architectures, there are some other diffusion model architectures for image and video generation. Diffusion-RWKV [193] introduces the RWKV [194] architecture as the Backbone for Diffusion models. The RWKV consists of an input layer, series of stacked residual blocks and an output layer. Each residual block consists of temporal mixing and channel mixing sub-blocks. RWKV improves on the standard RNN architecture by parallelizing computation during training similarly to RNN. It includes enhancements to the linear attention mechanism and designs the receptance weight key value (RWKV) mechanism. DiG [195] introduces Gated Linear Attention Transformer (GLA) [196] and proposes Diffusion GLA model. DiG achieves high efficiency in terms of training speed and GPU memory for high resolution image generation."

Early text-to-image approaches used text encoders which are trained on paired text-images, 9 Figure 6: Comparison of generated images from diffusion models with different text encoders. The last two rows are Chinese prompts, which are used to test image generation models with the text encoders that support the multilingual condition (i.e., OmniDiffusion [197], Kolors [161]). For models that do not support the multilingual text condition, the given prompts are translated into the corresponding language to generate images. and they can be trained from scratch [32, 186] or pre-trained (e.g., CLIP [198]). CLIP uses contrast learning, and is trained to align the embedding representations of the text and images. These text encoders can encode visual and textual semantics after being trained using paired text-images. After tokenizer and embedding, the input text prompt is injected as condition into the diffusion model generative backbone. As shown in the table 1, some classical text to image diffusion models [6, 33, 7275, 159, 80, 162] use the text branch of CLIP models for text representation. Typically, the parameters of these text encoders are frozen thus their computational and memory consumption during diffusion model training can be ignored. CLIP series models focus on the global representation of an image by aligning the embedding space of the image and the text, however, it is difficult 10 to understand the detailed description. Large language models are trained on larger text corpora and have stronger text comprehension and generation capabilities. Imagen [169] compared CLIP with pre-trained large language model (BERT [199], T5 [85]) as text encoders. In addition, they found that scaling the size of the text encoder can improve the quality of text-to-image generation and that using the T5-XXL encoder achieves better image-text alignment and image fidelity. Some approaches merge both CLIP and T5 encoders to improve the ability of text comprehension. Some image diffusion models [200202, 159] focus on understanding the multilingual prompt and generating images. HunyuanDiT [159] combines bilingual CLIP [86] and multilingual T5 [87] text encoder to improve Chinese comprehension. Some recent image [197, 161] and video [82] generation models use large language models (e.g., Baichuan [203], Llama [88, 89], and ChatGLM [90]) to enhance semantic understanding of complex text. Figure 6 provides visual comparison that demonstrates how the understanding of complex texts by large language models affects the generation effects of diffusion models."

To address these limitations, ControlNet [9] introduces visual features into the multiresolution layers of pre-trained UNet, thereby enabling more controllable generation. This advancement has spurred further research, resulting in several efficient variants of ControlNet [91 93]. As illustrated in Figure 8, these improvements focus on two main aspects: reducing the number of parameters in ControlNet while maintaining or improving its performance, and enhancing finergrained control without increasing the number of parameters. Figure 8: An illustration of ControlNet and its extensions, demonstrating its ability to guide image generation using various control signals such as edges, depth, segmentation, and poses. branch of works prefer to reduce the parameter count of ControlNet.

ControlNeXt [92] introduces lightweight convolutional module to extract control features, replaces zero-convolution with cross normalization to align the parameter distributions with those of main denoising branch and achieve faster and more stable training convergence. Another line of works enhance ControlNets controllability over the generated output while maintaining the same parameter count, ControlNet++ [93] employs pre-trained discriminative reward model to effectively bridge the gap between conditions and generated images, improving the quality and pixel-level relevance of the output when control signals are reflected in the generated images."

As crucial parts that allow models to perform variety of downstream tasks, adapters establish the intrinsic connection between the conditional inputs and their corresponding images, making them commonly used for controllable generation [96, 208, 209] and domain adaptation [210]. 12 Figure 9: An overview of the Adapter framework for diffusion models, illustrating various adapters, which facilitate feature mapping and injection processes, allowing the diffusion model to handle diverse input types.

Controllable generation Adapters effectively map diverse conditions into meaningful regions within the conditional space of diffusion models. For image generation, T2I-Adapter [42] captures conditional features and maps control feature to internal knowledge of the T2I model, achieving visual control of image generation. StableSketching [209] transforms semantic information from abstract sketch into textual conditional embedding and further constrains control features to pixel-perfect and textually meaningful regions in embedding space. SUR-Adapter [96] effectively navigates simple prompt features toward more information-dense region within the conditional space, enabling the generation of highly detailed images from simple prompts. IP-Adapter [94] maps image features into decoupled conditional space, enabling the model to generate images that resemble the input image. In the field of video synthesis, I2V-Adapter [205] aligns each frame of the video with the semantic information of the image condition, enhancing the overall coherence across frames. FaceChain-ImagineID [211] introduces textual inversion adapter to convert speech text embeddings into token embeddings. Simultaneously, spatial conditional adapter maps facial mesh, identity features, and masked adjacent frame features into the conditional space, maintaining audio-visual consistency and spatial coherence throughout the video. In summary, adapters play crucial role in injecting wide array of conditions into diffusion models, significantly enhancing the control and quality of generated content in images and videos. Domain adaptation Adapters in domain adaptation serve to align feature representations, enable task-specific adjustments, and facilitate efficient and effective transfer of knowledge from source domain to target domain. X-Adapter [95] establishes mapping relationship between the spatial features of the base diffusion model and those of the upgraded diffusion model.

The fine-tuned weight matrix becomes = W0 + , where W0 is the original pretrained weight. By restricting and to have low-rank r, where min(d, k), LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters and computational overhead during fine-tuning. Instead of freezing diffusion models and inserting new trainable modules to prevent catastrophic forgetting [9, 42], LoRA allows the learned weight update to be merged back into the original model after training, avoiding the need for additional inference time. Therefore, it has been widely applied to various downstream tasks, as shown in the table 4.

LCM-LoRA [101] can generate images in specific style while supporting fast inference with minimal steps, by linearly combining the style-related LoRA parameter and acceleration LoRA parameter. AnimateDiff [34] trains individual LoRAs to specialize in distinct motion patterns. During inference, these specialized LoRAs can be synergistically combined, enabling the generation of diverse and complex motion effects. LoRA-Composer [100] integrates multiple concept-specific LoRAs into the image generation process, ensuring each concept is accurately rendered in terms of position, size, and distinctive features. These methods enable multiple LoRAs to seamlessly generate different concepts in various regions of an image, or to combine distinct characteristics during the image generation process, fully exploiting the composable nature of LoRAs. Concept interpolation LoRA approximates the update direction within compact and structured parameter space through low-rank decomposition. As shown in Figure 10, when performing linear interpolation between LoRA parameters for different concepts, the resulting intermediate parameters smoothly blend the features of the original parameter sets. Concept Sliders [102] subsequently modifies the concept along specific parameter direction by scaling the guidance coefficient in training loss and the hyperparameters of LoRA. DiffMorpher [218] discovers LoRA has the capability to encapsulate image semantic identity, and achieves image morphing by performing linear interpolation on the LoRA parameters adapted to different concepts. Collectively, these advancements demonstrate that LoRA offers significant flexibility and control in the field of image generation and editing, allowing creators to achieve smoother transitions between different concepts."

While decrease in training loss indicates that the model is learning certain patterns, it does not necessarily mean that the generated images meet human aesthetic standards. Therefore, the preference training framework shown in Figure 11 has become critical approach for aligning models with human expectations. The current process for preference optimization in image generation tasks is generally divided into two steps. First, human aesthetic preferences are formalized into reward model [104, 109, 106, 225], which reduces the cost and time required for labeling data in the subsequent stages. Secondly, the direct finetuning on preferred outputs [108, 104, 109, 106] or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [103, 226, 227, 107] are employed to optimize the diffusion model against the reward model. Figure.12 illustrates the paradigms of each category. These methods avoid the complex computational burden associated with direct supervised training on large datasets labeled with preference tags, making preference optimization an efficient method. Reward model. It is crucial that the reward model effectively encodes human preferences, as this directly impacts the diffusion models ability to correctly learn and reflect individual aesthetics. The general idea of human preference modeling is to maximize the difference that the reward score of preferred image Iw with prompt condition is greater than the other outputs Il for any sample from the preference dataset, formulated as follows: Lreward = E(T,Iw,Il)D[log(σ(R(T, Iw) R(T, Il)))]. (9) where σ indicates the activation function and represents the reward model. HPS [104] fine-tunes the CLIP model using training data that includes text prompts and multiple images (one preferred and the others non-preferred), enabling the model to obtain human preference score. AHF [109] creates text-image groups with binary feedback datasets to train the CLIP model, applying the mean squared error (MSE) loss for accuracy and the cross-entropy loss to improve generalization to unseen data. ImageReward [106] employs scoring system where higher rankings yield higher scores to train the BLIP model, utilizing text-images dataset with ratings and rankings, allowing for finer distinction in image quality. Pick-a-Pic [225] is large dataset where each instance includes prompt, two generated images, and label indicating preference or tie. It is employed to fine-tune Figure 12: The illustrations of preference optimization paradigms. The trained reward model can be used in subsequent various preference optimization methods. the Pick Score, reward model based CLIP-H, with the objective of minimizing the KL divergence between the preference label and the softmax normalized scores of the two images. Direct fine-tuning has achieved remarkable preformance by leveraging reward model for supervised learning. RAFT [108], in each iteration, uses reward model to filter the samples generated by the diffusion model, selects the best-of-K sample for fine-tuning the model, thereby avoiding the overfitting problem when fine-tuning with datasets devoid of preference labels. AHF [109] introduces the negative reward-weighted log-likelihood into the loss function of preference optimization to improve the image-text alignment of the model. ImageReward [106], during the refinement phase of diffusion models utilizes ReFL loss and regularization with pre-training loss to prevent rapid overfitting and stabilize fine-tuning. HPS [104] suggests incorporating special identifier in the prompts during fine-tuning to distinguish preferred images. During inference, these special identifier serve as negative prompts for classifier-free guidance, effectively preventing the generation of non-preferred images. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) uses policy gradient to optimize humanpreferred policy aimed at maximizing the reward models scoring of generated images. DDPO [103] reframes the denoising process of diffusion model as multi-step Markov decision process and employs importance sampling techniques to optimize it. This algorithm serves as versatile framework for optimizing any downstream objective, covering aspects such as compressibility, aesthetic quality, and text alignment. DPOK [226] introduces two critical improvements over DPPO. Firstly, it incorporates KL regularization into the loss function, effectively curbing the models tendency to overfit to rewards. Secondly, by additionally training value function, it not only significantly reduces the variance in gradient estimation but also further enhances the performance of the final reward. D3PO [227] overcomes the application obstacles of DPO [228] in diffusion models without the need for pre-trained reward models. It trains through online learning, leveraging real-time preference annotations from experts on two images generated from the same text. Diffusion-DPO [107] directly optimizes the policy that aligns more closely with human preferences during the single-step denoising process, effectively solving the problem of prolonged training time due to the need for multi-step reverse denoising in previous methods."

In this section, we present two mainstream personalized synthesis methods and discuss their contributions to label-efficient approaches. Fine-tuning-based personalization approaches have focused on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to learn placeholder token that captures the identity information of reference subjects. For instance, DreamBooth [10] conducts full fine-tuning, Textual Inversion [110] adjusts the embeddings of pseudo-words, and Custom-Diffusion [232] optimizes the key, value mapping matrices within cross-attention layers. Moreover, LoRA [99] introduces minimal number of trainable parameters and trains individually on few customized datasets, facilitating the widespread utilization of LoRA for customization. Recent efforts [115, 113, 100, 114] focus on achieving multi-concept customization by combining LoRA weights from different concepts, aiming to improve identity preservation, handle occlusions, and enhance foreground-background harmony. However, fine-tuning-based approaches often require training for thousands of steps to customize concepts and most of them rely solely on placeholder token embedding which proves insufficient for effectively decoupling specific concepts from their background layouts. To address this, encoderbased methods [112, 233, 105, 111, 231, 229, 234] utilize additional image encoders to inject the reference image details for subject generation. ELITE [112] and DreamTuner [105] adopt strategy that progressively extracts visual information of target features, from coarse to fine, enabling more precise and controllable subject-driven image generation.

We further present the generation performance of these methods in terms of efficiency, i.e., Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs ) and quality i.e., Fréchet Inception Distance (FID ). sampling from noise to data. The SDE is fundamental to both the forward and reverse processes in generative modeling. Song et. al. [116] unified previous generative models into common mathematical framework via SDEs in Eqs. 5. Specifically, the forward and reverse processes in DDPM [2] and SMLD [59] are discretizations of the following SDEs: DDPM: (cid:26)forward: dxt = 1 reverse: dxt = 1 SMLD: forward: dxt = reverse: dxt = d(σ2(t)) 2 β(t)xtdt + (cid:112)β(t)dw, 2 β(t)[xt xt log pt(x)]dt + (cid:112)β(t)d w; (cid:113) d(σ2(t)) dt dt xt log pt(x)dt + (cid:113) d(σ2(t)) dt dw, w. (10) (11) By carefully designing the SDE and its discretization scheme, the SDE solver seeks to balance the number of steps and approximation errors, thereby improving both the efficiency and quality of outputs in diffusion models. Noise-Conditional Score Networks (NCSNs) [59] generate new data points through Langevin dynamics, using score matching to estimate the gradient of the data distribution. NCSNs identified three issues when data lies on low-dimensional manifold: (1) the score function is undefined in low data-density regions; (2) due to the sparsity of training data, score estimation in low-density regions is inaccurate; and (3) in Langevin dynamics, it is difficult to effectively mix different modes of the distribution. To address these problems, NCSNs introduce multi-level noise to perturb the data and adopt Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), where sampling starts with the score corresponding to the highest noise level, and the noise is gradually reduced until convergence to the original data distribution. Building upon this, Jolicoeur-Martineau et. al. [118] discussed the inconsistencies in noise scaling within ALD and proposed Consistent Annealed Sampling (CAS), score-based MCMC method that ensures noise levels follow predefined schedule, providing more stable alternative to ALD. Also building on Langevin dynamics, Dockhorn et al. introduced Critically-damped Langevin Diffusion (CLD) [117]. As proved in [116], the score function learnt by the neural network is uniquely determined by the forward process, CLD thus posits that smoother forward process can lead to faster and more efficient sample generation. Inspired by statistical mechanics, CLD introduces novel SDE by incorporating velocity variable vt, enabling diffusion in the joint data-velocity space 19 Figure 14: The illustration of training-based methods. (xt vt). In CLD, noise is only injected into vt, thereby avoiding the oscillations of under-damped systems and the slow dynamics of over-damped systems. Additionally, CLD only needs to learn the gradient of the velocity distribution vt log pt(vtxt) given the data, which is arguably simpler than learning the score function of the diffused data directly. This method combines Hamiltonian dynamics with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, efficiently exploring the state space and ensuring convergence, thus enabling more efficient sampling and high-quality data generation. The predictor-corrector method proposed in [116] solves the reverse-time SDE by alternating numerical SDE solvers (predictor) and score-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (corrector). At each time step, the predictor, such as Euler-Maruyama and stochastic Runge-Kutta methods, approximates the reverse-time SDE, providing an estimate of the sample xt at the next time step t. Then score-based corrector refines the marginal distribution of xt. The predictor enables fast convergence and the corrector ensures sample diversity and quality. The resulting samples maintain the same time marginals as the solution to the reverse-time SDE, which allows them to closely align with the target distribution during the actual generation process. EDM [57] combines secondorder deterministic ODE integrator with Langevin-like churn perturbation of alternatively adding and removing noise. This approach improves the corrector from [116], achieving state-of-the-art generation quality at the time. Another issue of numerical SDE solvers is that they require large number of score network evaluations. Jolicoeur-Martineau et. al. [119] devise an SDE solver with adaptive step sizes to accelerate the generation process. The step size is determined by comparing the outputs of low-order solver and high-order solver. At each step of the generation process, the solver generates both low-order from the previous sample sample prev. The error between these two samples is then evaluated via: and high-order sample Eq = (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) x δ(x l, prev) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13)2 , δ(x l, prev) = max(ϵabs, ϵrel max(x l, prev)), (12) where ϵabs and ϵrel are absolute and relative tolerance. If and the step size will be increased. and h are similar, then is accepted In more specific situation, CCDF [120] focuses on efficient sampling in conditional image generation tasks by leveraging the contraction property of the reverse diffusion path. It proposes that the generation process does not need to start from pure Gaussian noise but can significantly reduce sampling steps by starting from an initialization closer to the target. The input image is first perturbed with noise up to t0 (where t0 < , and this noise addition process is nearly free), and then reverse denoising starts from t0 to generate the conditional image. As result, generating target images needs far fewer steps than . In super-resolution (SR), inpainting, and MRI reconstruction tasks, the method achieves excellent results with only 10, 20, and 20 reverse diffusion steps, respectively. 20 PF-ODE solver is one of the most commonly used strategy to accelerate the sampling process [121, 122, 57, 123, 237, 124, 125, 130]. Different from SDE Solver, the sampling process of PF-ODE solvers is deterministic, hence is suitable to serve as the teacher model in the knowledge distillation methods [238, 132, 131]. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) [121] is notable faster diffusion sampling scheduler, which supports larger denoising steps via non-Markovian diffusion processes. Particularly, DDIM is particular formulation of ODE, whose iteration can be rewrote as: (cid:115) 1 αt1 xt1 = (cid:114) 1 αt xt + ( (cid:115) 1 αt1 αt1 (cid:114) 1 αt αt )ϵ(t) θ (xt), (13) After reparameterization, the equation can be transformed to the reverse of ODE. Inspired by the observation that when the training dataset contains one sample, DDIM can exactly solve the corresponding SDEs/ODE, Zhang et.al. extend DDIM to general DMs, i.e., gDDIM [124]. Liu et.al. [122] discover two limitations of DDIM. First, the denoising model and ODE are well-defined only in limited area. However, the sampling process with larger steps may generates samples away from the well-defined area, hence result in new errors. Second, when the index 0, the ODE equation tends to infinity in many higher-order numerical methods. The phenomenon leads to additional error for the fine-grained denoising steps. To address these issues, PNDM [122] solve the ODE on certain manifolds, which is consists of gradient and transfer parts. The former finds the gradient in each step, and the latter generates the result at the next step. PNDM makes the sampling trajectory is more consistent with the pre-trained area, hence generating higher-quality images with skipped steps. Further, DPM-Solver [123] and DEIS [125] calculate the exact solutions of the diffusion ODEs by semi-linear structure, hence the solvers support larger steps with less error. Specifically, DPM-Solver finds that diffusion ODEs can be divided two parts, i.e. linear (drift coefficient) and non-linear (diffusion coefficient) functions. Previous methods uniformly deal with these two parts, which causes discretization errors particularly on the linear part. Actually, the part can be analytically computed. For the non-linear part, DPM-Solver [123] simplifies the formulation by introducing log-SNR, which is strictly decreasing function of t. Next, Taylor expansion is utilized for approximating the non-linear part. Moreover, DEIS [125] utilize high-order polynomial extrapolation to reduce the approximation error, which achieves better sampling quality. Besides, to improve the quality of generated samples with accelerated sampling, UniPC [126] utilizes the output ϵθ(xt, t) at current timestep to correct the predicted sample. NonUniform [127] accelerates diffusion sampling by exploring discretization scheme for time steps, the orders of different steps can be different in the numerical ODE solvers. Retrieval based methods retrieve trajectory from pre-computed knowledge base to accelerate the sampling process [130]. Inspired by an crucial common sense that the previous sampling steps determine the layout of the images, and the following steps determine the details [239, 240]. ReDi [130] first proposes retrieval based learning free acceleration strategy. Specifically, the samples of first few steps are generated, which are utilized as the query in the retrieval process. Sequentially, the top-H keys that have highest similarity with the initialized query are selected. Next, the linearly combined values are utilized as the remaining steps of the sampling process."

            "content": "Knowledge Distillation [242] is one of the most common sampling strategy in learning based method, which distills the knowledge from deterministic ODE (teacher) models to the accelerated sampling (student) models. According to the learning objectives, these sampling strategies can be divided into three groups, i.e., distribution-based, trajectory-based, and GAN-based distillations. Distribution based distillation strategy accelerate the sampling steps of student models by minimizing the image or latent distributions [131133, 30, 31, 101, 134]. Luhman et.al. [131] first propose Denoising Student to reduce the iterative denoising steps by knowledge distillation. Specifically, the 100-step DDIM scheduler with pre-trained diffusion model is leveraged as the teacher model Mt, which obtains deterministic x0 from the random xT . Meanwhile, the student model Ms use one step denoising setting to accelerate the sampling process. Next, in order to generate high quality images, the predicted distribution of student model Ms is aligned with the iterative denoised 0 from Mt. The learning objective of Ms is formalized as: 21 Distribution Based Distillation CIFAR-10 ImageNet MS-COCO Denoising Student [131] Progressive Distillation [132] Meng et al.

NFEs and FID are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and quality of sampling methods. Ls = ExT [D(Ms(x0xT ), Mt(x0xT ))], (14) is the function that measures the distance between distributions, which is implemented by KL divergence. To inherit the learned knowledge, Ms is initialized with the original architecture and weight from the Mt. Compared with SOTA one step models e.g., NVAE [243], BigGAN [244], Denoising Student performs better generation ability on standard datasets. Subsequently, considering the expensive time cost caused by the full number of sampling [131], Progressive Distillation [132] is proposed to iteratively accelerate the sampling process. During each iteration, the student model is trained to predict the noise after 2 DDIM sampling steps, and the optimized student model is utilized as the teacher model in the next iteration. Hence the sampling number is reduced in exponential rate. Moreover, Meng et.al. [133] design two stage training method to apply the distillation strategy to classifier-free models. In the first stage, following [63], the denoised feature of teacher model is calculated by (cid:102)Mt(zt, c) = (1 + w)Mt(zt, c) wMt(zt). Then, the learning objective of student model is: Ewpw,tU [0,1] (cid:2)ω(λt)Ms(zt, c, w) Mt(zt, c)2 (cid:3) , (15) where pw = [wmin, wmax], ω(λt) is the pre-specified weighting function [52]. After distilling student model to fit classifier-free models, the second stage utilizes the progressively distillation strategy [132] to accelerate the sampling steps. In addition to the above methods, consistency models [30] (CMs) is milestone in efficient inference and sampling, which proposes remarkable consistency regularization, i.e., 22 = E[λ(tn)d(fθ(xtn+1 , tn+1), fθ (ˆxϕ tn , tn))], (16) where λ(tn) denotes the weighting of n-th step, d() measures the distance of two distributions, which can be implemented by L1, L2 and LPIPS functions. Given the distribution in tn+1-th step, ˆxϕ tn is acquired by running one discretization step of score based denoising model sϕ. The fθ means the trained denoising network, the parameters θ of the network is updated by θ in an exponential moving average (EMA) manner. Overall, CMs assums that the distribution at any time step in the PF-ODE trajectory can be directly mapped to the distribution at t0. Sequentially, LCM [31] leverages augmented consistency function to align the diffusers with input text conditions, and further designs skipping-step technique to accelerate the convergence of denoising models. Inspired by previous distribution matching methods [245], DMD [134] finetunes the distilled model to learn the fake distribution of pretrained models, which enforce the generated images of student model is indistinguishable from the original teacher model. Trajectory based distillation strategy accelerates sampling process by improving the trajectory of solving PF-ODE [136, 137, 28, 138, 139]. Rectified Flow [136] proposes to rectify the trajectory from non-linear path to straight path, which is formally defined as: min (cid:90) 1 E[(X1 X0) v(Xt, t)2]dt, withXt = tX1 + (1 t)X0, (17) according to the equation, it can be observed that Xt is the linear interpolation of X0 and X1, which models the shortest path between the samples. To build the one-to-one correspondence between the samples from two distributions π0 and π1, they design reflow method, which first trains the sampling model using randomly selected X0 and X1. Then, the first stage model is leveraged to provide accurate correspondence for training the second stage model. Sequentially, InstaFlow [137] is proposed to acquire text conditional rectified flow models. To further accelerate the sampling process, PeRFlow [139] trains piecewise linear flow by creating times window, and follows the reflow operation to straightening each trajectory. Similarly, DSNO [28] proposes parallel decoding method, which is accomplished by Fourier neural operator (FNO) [246]. In addition to the strategy of using gradient descent algorithm based on trajectory for distillation, SFT-PG [138] introduces reinforcement learning into efficient sampling. To this end, the policy gradient is utilized to replace the gradient descent, and minimizing the integral probability metrics (IPM) to achieve better generation quality in few steps. Adversarial based distillation combines the advantages of GAN and diffusion models [140, 141]. Diffusion models have powerful generation capacity, which are able to generate high-quality images [33, 80] and videos [247, 248]. However, these models suffers from iteratively sampling process [124, 249], hindering their application in real-world scenes. On the contrary, GAN models is able to generate images in single-step formulation, but often fall short of the quality, particularly artifacts [250, 251]. Inspired by these observations, ADD [140] introduces discriminator model [252] to optimize the accelerated sampling model. The adversarial loss is defined as follows: adv(Ms(xt, t), ϕ) = Ex0 LD (cid:34) (cid:88) max(0, 1 Dϕ(x0)) + γR1(ϕ) (cid:35) + EMs (cid:34) (cid:88) max(0, 1 + D(Ms(xt, t))) , (cid:35) (18) where Dϕ is the discriminator, R1 is the R1 gradient penalty [253]. Meanwhile, in order to retaining the high quality generation capacity, pre-trained diffusion model is utilized as teacher model. Although ADD achieves fast sampling model, its denoising process is limited in the pixel level (RGB space) due to the discriminator. Specifically, LDD utilizes DINOv2 [252] as backbone of the discriminator, which cannot predict in latent space. Moreover, the generated images are fixed to 518518 pixels. To address the issues, LADD [141] unifies the teacher and discriminator, and input discriminator with latent features. Therefore, LADD is able to produce high-resolution images with smaller storage cost. 23 GAN objective methods utilize multimodal conditional distribution to replace the rigorous Guassian distribution in the diffusion models, which is called denoising diffusion GAN [142144]. DDGAN [142] first proposes to train diffusion models with GAN objective, which inherits the fast sampling strength of GAN. The most crucial observation is that only small steps achieves regorious Gaussian distribution, and larger steps result in multimodal (peak) distribution. Therefore, to accelerate the sampling process, the multimodal conditional distribution is utilized to replace the unimodal Gaussian distribution. Please note that adversarial based distillation methods discriminate the generated samples and real images, while denoising diffusion GAN models use denoised latent as real samples. However, DDGAN can not be applied to large scale dataset due to the nonscalability of GAN. To this end, SIDDMs [143] adds loss term to explicitly match the conditional distribution. Sequentially, UFOGen [144] is proposed to achieve the one-step sampling. Xu et.al. thinks the failure of DDGAN and SIDDMs mainly caused by the posterior prediction in the denoising process. In this way, the denoising diffusion GAN is able to directly match the distribution of x0. Optimization strategy contains methods that design acceleration strategies by introducing prior information during training and inference processes [128, 129, 238, 254, 255, 145, 146]. Watson et.al. introduce an dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal discrete time schedules, which can be applied to any pre-trained DDPMs [128]. The method is based on the decomposability property of evidence lower bound (ELBO) that the total ELBO is the sum of individual KL terms. Then, they maintain two matrices C, R(K+1)(D+1) to find the sampling path in steps with minimum ELBO . C[k, t] denotes the minimum ELBO in iteration with steps, and D[k, t] records the optimal path of the current step, the state transition equation of the dynamic programming can be formally defined as: C[k, t] = min (C[k 1, s] + L(t, s)), D[k, t] = arg min (C[k 1, s] + L(t, s)), (19) where L(t, s) is the decomposed ELBO from to s. However, the metric used in [128] has mismatch with the quality of generated images, e.g., FID scores. To address this issue, GGDM utilizes Kernel Inception Distance (KID) as perceptual loss to obtain high-fidelity images [129]. Truncated diffusion methods accelerate the sampling process by introducing early stop into training and inference process [145, 256]. The denoising process is started from non-Gaussian distributions, then we can perform only few denoising steps to generate the high-quality images. Specifically, the non-Gaussian distributions is obtained from existing generative models such as GAN [245, 257] and VAE [167], which is able to approximate the distribution of the data without expensive iteration process."

            "content": "In practical applications, the efficient deployment of diffusion models as tools is crucial for researchers, developers, and other AIGC practitioners. These users require high degree of flexibility and control over the generation process to adjust and optimize model configurations across various scenarios. This type of deployment offers an environment for deep experimentation and customization, fully leveraging the potential of diffusion models. It is especially suited for tasks that require testing multiple model configurations, adjusting noise parameters, optimizing performance, or integrating custom components. Therefore, tool-based deployment typically emphasizes modular design, scalability, adaptability to diverse needs, and high level of control. 24 Figure 15: Efficient deployment as tool and as service. In implementation, these tools must strike balance between ease of use and technical depth. Professional users need an interface that is both intuitive and allows for in-depth adjustment of model parameters. Achieving this balance poses significant design challenges, requiring tools that cater to expert needs without overwhelming the user with complexity. Taking ComfyUI3 as an example, it employs node-based workflow interface, allowing users to visually create and modify complex image generation processes. By connecting different nodes, users can construct each step of the model and flexibly adjust the parameters and hyperparameters of each module. This modular design is particularly well-suited for users who seek to refine and customize the generation process, especially researchers and developers who benefit from being able to track each stage of the workflow from input to output. ComfyUIs node-based architecture greatly facilitates the integration of custom models and new algorithms. Users can easily introduce new nodes, algorithms, or functional modules to experiment with. This is especially beneficial for developers, as they can flexibly swap components without needing to overhaul the entire system. Researchers, on the other hand, can quickly and conveniently compare the performance of different model components before and after adjustments. However, the flexibility of ComfyUI also makes its learning curve steeper, making it more suitable for users who have deeper understanding of the overall diffusion model process. In contrast, Stable Diffusion WebUI4 (commonly referred to as Automatic1111 or WebUI) offers simple form-like interface. Users can quickly generate images by entering parameters such as prompts, number of steps, CFG scale, and image resolution. This design is particularly well-suited for users who want fast and straightforward image generation process, especially beginners. Even though the detailed image generation workflow is hidden, WebUI still provides advanced features and customization options to meet the needs of more experienced users. Through its plugin system, users can realize various features, such as inpainting and personalized training tools like Textual Inversion and ControlNet. While it lacks flexibility of the node-based ComfyUI, the ease of using plugins makes it ideal for users who want to expand functionality without extensively modifying the model. Automatic1111s WebUI is more user-friendly and accessible, with its streamlined formbased interface allowing users to input parameters and generate images quickly, making it suitable for those looking for fast results. For users without strong technical background, it offers true \"plug-and-play\" experience. 3https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI 4https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui These tools offer users extensive control over the generation process, from adjusting the number of diffusion steps to integrating custom plugins or models tailored for specific domains. They not only meet the needs of advanced users involved in research and development but also address the practical requirements of deployment in production environments. When deployed in cloud environments, these tools typically provide scalable infrastructure to accommodate large-scale workflows. For instance, ComfyUI can seamlessly integrate with Amazon EKS, enabling dynamic scaling of GPU instances to meet the demands of large-scale parallel inference in the cloud. Additionally, an active user community contributes numerous resources to these tools, including comprehensive APIs and documentation, encouraging developers to create and share custom plugins. This open ecosystem not only enriches the tools functionality but also opens up new possibilities for various applications, spanning from artistic creation to scientific research and industrial design."

            "content": "Efficient Deployment as Service is aimed at broader user base, typically requiring neither advanced technical expertise nor local high-end computational resources. Service providers package comprehensive tools to simplify the complex processing of diffusion models into \"one-click\" user experience. Their efforts are focused on optimizing the inference process and user interaction for real-world deployment scenarios on mobile and cloud platforms. The goal is to deliver faster, more stable inference services that meet the needs of everyday users, while also addressing cost control and privacy concerns. In [258], Google optimizes GPU memory I/O to significantly reduce inference latency on mobile devices via two key improvements: enhanced attention modules and Winograd convolution. By using partially fused Softmax to reduce memory access for large intermediate matrices, along with FlashAttention to lower memory bandwidth pressure, the attention mechanisms efficiency was greatly enhanced. Additionally, Winograd convolution accelerated the 3 3 convolution layers, striking balance between computational efficiency and memory usage. Tests showed that on the Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro Max, the latency for generating 512px resolution images was reduced by 52.2% and 32.9%, respectively, with inference time dropping to under 12 seconds over 20 steps and memory usage capped at 2,093 MB. Despite these improvements, latency remains high for interactive mobile applications. SnapFusion [147] made breakthrough by reducing inference time to under 2 seconds for text-to-image generation on mobile devices. To achieve this, SnapFusion optimized the UNet by removing redundant computations through an evolving-training framework. To further reduce inference steps, it introduced CFG-aware step distillation, greatly enhancing both efficiency and stability. Tests on the iPhone 14 Pro demonstrated that SnapFusion can generate 512px images in just 2 seconds, and in experiments on the MS-COCO dataset, it achieved superior FID and CLIP scores using only 8 denoising steps, outperforming Stable Diffusion v1.5 with 50 steps. To further optimizes both the architecture of diffusion models for mobile devices, MobileDiffusion [148] redesigns the UNet by sharing projection matrices, replacing activation functions, and adopting separable convolutions to achieve lightweight model. The VAE decoder is pruned for width and depth while increasing latent channels, accelerating decoding while maintaining reconstruction quality. For sampling, it introduces UFOGens Diffusion-GAN hybrid training method [144], enabling one-step sampling. By leveraging adversarial fine-tuning and distillation techniques, the model generates high-quality images in just one step. On the iPhone 15 Pro, MobileDiffusion generates 512px images in under 0.2 seconds, while also supporting various downstream applications such as controlled generation (e.g., based on text, canny edge or depth map), personalized generation (e.g., Style-LoRA, Object-LoRA), and in-painting. However, due to the limited computational resources of mobile devices, it is difficult to achieve fast generation of high-quality, high-resolution images. Applications that need to handle largescale tasks while requiring high-speed generation often rely on efficient deployment on cloud-based infrastructure of service providers. Cloud deployment not only leverages more powerful hardware resources to handle complex tasks but also improves the efficiency of concurrent inference through distributed computing and elastic scaling, as shown in Figure.16. To achieve low-latency, high-resolution image generation without compromising image quality, DistriFusion [149] focuses on parallelism across multiple GPUs. Observing the high similarity between 26 Figure 16: Efficient cloud-based deployment strategies for diffusion models. inputs from adjacent diffusion steps, it reuses activations from previous steps to provide global context and inter-block interaction. Based on this, DistriFusion proposes Displaced Patch Parallelism, where the input image is divided into multiple patches and processed in parallel by SD-XL on different GPUs. The global results from the previous step are reused to approximate the context for the current step, while asynchronous communication prepares the global context for the next step, effectively hiding communication latency. In practice, DistriFusion achieves speedups of approximately 2.8, 4.9, and 6.1 for generating images at 1024px, 2048px, and 3840px resolutions, respectively, using 8 A100 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality, compared to single A100 GPU processing. To address the computational and latency challenges of generating high-resolution images with Diffusion Transformers (DiT) across multiple GPUs, PipeFusion [150] also leverages the high similarity between inputs from adjacent steps. However, applying DistriFusion method to DiT can result in inefficient memory usage due to the need for large communication buffers. To overcome this, PipeFusion introduces Displaced Patch Pipeline Parallelism. This method divides the image into patches and distributes transformer layers across different GPUs, using pipeline parallelism for computation and communication. By transmitting only the input activations of the initial layer and the output activations of the final layer via asynchronous point-to-point (P2P) communication between adjacent devices, it significantly reduces data transfer and memory usage. Tested on three GPU clusters using PCIe or NVLink, PipeFusion outperforms other parallelization techniques in terms of end-to-end latency at various resolutions. For instance, in 4 A100 (PCIe) cluster, PipeFusion achieves latency reductions of 2.01, 1.48x, and 1.10 at 1024px, 2048px, and 8192px resolutions, respectively. This is especially significant at 8192px, where other methods often face Out Of Memory issues. PipeFusion dramatically lowers the required communication bandwidth, enabling the DiT model to run efficiently on GPUs connected via PCIe, without the need for costly NVLink infrastructure, thus significantly reducing operational costs for service providers. Unlike patch-based parallel methods, AsyncDiff [151] focuses on asynchronous parallel inference. In traditional diffusion models, denoising steps are performed sequentially, where each steps input depends on the previous steps output. AsyncDiff breaks this dependency chain by also leveraging the high similarity between inputs from adjacent diffusion steps, enabling parallel computation of denoising components. It introduces asynchronous denoising, model parallel strategies, and stride denoising, allowing multiple denoising steps to be processed concurrently in single parallel round, reducing the number of parallel computation rounds and communication frequency between devices. This approach significantly improves inference speed while maintaining image quality. On four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs, AsyncDiff achieved 4 speedup on SDv2.1 with only 0.38 reduction in CLIP score. Additionally, this method is also effective for video diffusion models, significantly reducing latency while maintaining high video quality."

The application of diffusion models to image synthesis gains prominence with the emergence of text-to-image diffusion models [32, 6, 5, 33, 206, 286], enabling the generation of high-quality images from natural language descriptions. Subsequently, efficient fine-tuning techniques expand the application of diffusion models to various conditional image generation tasks, including the structures [9, 42] and content [10, 111]. Meanwhile, research into efficient sampling methods further facilitates the practical application of these technologies, driving the broader advancement of image synthesis. Customized generation is an important research direction in image synthesis, aiming to achieve tailored outputs that meet specific user needs. Dreambooth [10] introduces subject-driven customized generation [287289, 232, 112, 111, 290, 291], which faithfully preserves the visual In addition, identity customization content of the themes depicted in the provided samples. [231, 292, 293, 230, 294, 229, 295] is achieved through the high-fidelity preservation of facial features. Moreover, some work focuses on visual text generation [296302] , emphasizing accurate text creation within images, which aids in producing high-quality posters. At the same time, there are also interesting developments in visual storytelling [303307] applications, which aim to generate coherent series of images, such as comics, to enhance the efficiency of artistic creation. Finally, in the field of safe image generation, privacy and copyright protection techniques [308316] have become key research priorities. 7."

However, they are constrained by the expensive fine-tuning costs to learn the editing instructions. Therefore, some researchers have concentrated on domain-specific editing techniques [327333] to address this issue. On the other hand, some work focuses on fine-tuning during the inference stage to further enhance editing efficiency. This includes techniques such as text embedding fine-tuning [154, 334, 240, 335], latent variable optimization [263, 336, 337, 328, 338], and fine-tuning of the diffusion model itself [339, 340, 155, 341]. Currently, finetuning-free methods have shown significant potential for efficient editing, attracting increased research attention. To avoid fine-tuning, researchers have closely analyzed the attention layers that interact most frequently with editing control conditions and proposed the classic attention modification methods [153, 342349]. Subsequently, sampling modification [350360] and mask guidance [361366] techniques were introduced to further enhance accuracy. These techniques have been widely adopted across various editing scenarios. For example, the recently popular virtual try-on technology [261, 367376, 260] on e-commerce platforms allows users to better visualize how garments will look when worn. Additionally, image style transfer technology [9, 42, 94, 111, 262, 330, 377, 378, 367, 379] allows for the flexible generation of 29 stylized and customized images, preserving the original content while showcasing diverse range of visual styles. On the other hand, diffusion model-based methods have also shown outstanding performance in solving low-level vision tasks, such as super-resolution [54, 120, 380382, 157, 383392], deblurring [54, 385, 386, 388390, 392399], inpainting [120, 389393, 400403], and compression artifact removal [404407]. These can be seen as broader form of the editing process."

            "title": "7.3 Video Generation",
            "content": "The essence of video is sequence of images ordered temporally. Consequently, text-to-video synthesis techniques [11, 18, 12, 35, 408, 169, 172, 409, 410, 266, 411, 412, 265] based on diffusion models greatly benefit from advancements in text-to-image synthesis technology, including shared aspects such as model architecture [33, 12]and training methods [9, 98, 205, 211]. In addition, similar to controllable image generation techniques, video generation has also integrated various control conditions, such as image-guided [15, 34, 413, 414], pose-guided [415419], motion-guided [415, 420], sound-guided [421423], depth-guided [424, 425], and multi-modal guided [426428] approaches. These advancements further enhance controllability and improve the efficiency of custom content creation. As dynamic form of images, video emphasizes the controllability of motion [34, 412, 413, 429 433], making it crucial research direction in video generation. It allows users to precisely control motion trajectories and dynamic effects, providing greater creative freedom and more accurate visual expression. Meanwhile, character animation [417, 415, 434436] is fascinating task that aims to generate character videos from static images using driving signals. Through this process, characters can exhibit natural movements and expressions, resulting in lively and dynamic content. Additionally, world models have become significant research focus, particularly for the field of autonomous driving [437441]. These models show great potential for generating high-quality driving videos and designing safe driving strategies by simulating real-world scenarios.Currently, generating longer videos [264, 11, 442, 163, 79] is highly challenging task, but it holds the potential to create more complex and content-rich visual works."

            "title": "7.4 Video Editing",
            "content": "Text-guided video editing aims to achieve similar goals to image editing, but with videos as the target for editing. These techniques can be categorized based on their efficiency in achieving editing capabilities. The first category involves training on large-scale video-text datasets to develop generalized editing capabilities, which is the most straightforward approach to developing generalized editing capabilities. The second category, one-shot tuning methods, refines pre-trained models using specific video instances to provide more accurate and contextually relevant video editing, offering balanced trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, training-free methods adapt pretrained models in zero-shot manner but often face challenges with spatio-temporal distortions. These issues are addressed through techniques such as feature propagation, hierarchical constraints, and attention mechanisms. One of the fundamental goals of video editing is to maintain temporal consistency between frames, ensuring that the generated video appears smooth and natural. Building on this foundation, virtual try-on for videos represents significant application that aims to enhance the users ability to edit the content and appearance of objects [443, 267, 444446, 17], allowing for more realistic experience of different garments or accessories. Concurrently, video action editing has also garnered considerable attention [447, 448, 420, 268], focusing on the flexible manipulation of character or object movements. Recently, research has introduced unified models that integrate these two aspects, aiming to achieve more efficient editing [449452, 269271, 269]. This approach not only enhances the flexibility of editing processes but also preserves video coherence, ultimately providing users with superior editing experience. 7.5 3D Synthesis 3D synthesis [23, 25, 221, 453457, 274, 27, 277, 278] is technique used to create and combine three-dimensional images or scenes [458464, 276], typically involving the integration of multiple 3D models, textures, and lighting effects to generate realistic 3D visuals. This technology is widely used in film production, video games, virtual reality, augmented reality, and computer graphics. Through 3D compositing, users can create highly detailed and dynamic 3D environments, enhancing visual immersion and interactive experiences. Human motion modeling [465474] is crucial component in animating virtual characters to mimic lifelike and dynamic human movements. This area becomes an important focus in various applications, including film production and game development. Building on the foundation of human motion modeling, 3D digital avatars [273, 475478, 275] take this concept further by creating digital representations of three-dimensional virtual characters. These avatars not only feature realistic appearances and personalized traits but also possess the ability to perform wide range of actions and behaviors. Moreover, to enhance the realism and interactivity of these avatars, speech-driven gesture [479482] plays vital role. By integrating hand, arm, and body movements with speech, this aspect of embodied human communication significantly improves both human-computer interaction and human-human digital communication."

Researchers optimize diffusion models based on the unique characteristics of these imaging modalities, enabling the generation of high-quality medical images that alleviate data scarcity issues and enhance the accuracy of image analysis. One of the most prominent research directions is the generation of missing imaging types, such as translating CT images to MRI [483485, 283], which improves diagnostic consistency while reducing time and costs. Furthermore, diffusion models directly synthesize high-quality medical images [486493], thereby effectively alleviating data scarcity issues. By annotating real and high-quality synthetic data, self-supervised learning methods have shown broad potential in tasks such as medical image classification [494499], segmentation [500, 489, 501, 502], reconstruction [503, 285, 504509], and denoising [510, 511], thus advancing the development of medical image analysis. Additionally, diffusion models excel in medical anomaly detection [495499] by generating healthy images and identifying abnormal regions, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. These applications indicate that diffusion models hold significant promise and value in the realm of medical imaging."

            "content": "Diffusion models emerge as highly promising tools in bioinformatics due to their strong capacity for processing high-dimensional data, generating diverse synthetic data, and flexibly adapting to various bioinformatics tasks. Diffusion models provide more versatile approach to protein design and generation [512516, 281, 517519, 279, 282, 520], overcoming the limitations of traditional generative models that can only produce small proteins or specific domains. This capability enables scientists to design proteins with specific functional or structural characteristics, which is crucial for protein engineering and drug discovery. Additionally, in molecular design [521530], diffusion models effectively model linkers between fragmented molecular components to identify and optimize small molecules that interact with biological targets, such as enzymes or receptors, thereby accelerating the generation and evaluation of potential drug candidates. Lastly, predicting the conformations of ligands bound to proteins is essential for studying protein-ligand interactions [531, 532, 280, 533, 534]. Diffusion models facilitate this by predicting the interaction patterns of small molecules (ligands) with specific binding sites on proteins, helping researchers quickly identify potential drug candidates and optimize their designs to enhance drug efficacy and selectivity. In summary, diffusion models play critical role in protein design and generation, small molecule and drug design, and modeling protein-ligand interactions, significantly advancing the application of bioinformatics."

            "content": "Although the theories and applications of diffusion models have emerged rapidly in recent years, there are still many limitations that deserve our attention and solution for efficient diffusion models. We briefly sort out these concerns below, hoping that they can serve as potential directions for future exploration: 31 Despite the excellent performance, the architecture of the current diffusion models still suffer from high computational complexity caused by the attention computing, especially in 3D and video diffusion models, which leads to heavy FLOPs and inference latency. Moreover, current fine-tuned models still struggle with poor task and domain generalization. For instance, ControlNets solely excels at handling vision-conditional controllable generation and Adapters require structural redesign for each new task, which reduce their flexibility. feasible future direction would involve designing unified framework that can handle multimodal and multi-granularity control, enabling more efficient and versatile task adaptation without the need for extensive architectural adjustments. By integrating MoE [535, 536] designs into diffusion models, dynamic networks can be created to support more flexible generation process [537, 538]. By dynamically activating different expert modules according to the input datas characteristics, the model can allocate computational resources more efficiently, thereby improving its adaptability to diverse and complex tasks. The trade-off between training cost and sampling quality is another critical issue. Up to now, most existing training-free methods still require over 10 sampling NFEs to ensure high-fidelity. Despite training-based methods can accelerate the process, they are still limited by the high training costs, such as time, data, and GPU resources. An effective route is to integrate these above two methods for high-quality and low-consumption model training. In terms of deployment and practical application, current diffusion models still take considerable time, high computational cost and storage requirements, especially in low-resource environments. Moreover, model compression and high-quality generation is still an important balance. Last but not least, communication overhead and memory efficiency in large-scale inference require further optimization. Researchers could focus on more efficient model compression or distillation, improved cross-device communication strategies, and leveraging hardware acceleration to enhance inference speed, stability, and image quality in future works. In addition to the above mentioned directions, researchers can also investigate speculative decoding [539, 540] by employing collaborative approach between small and large models to improve the efficiency of diffusion models [541, 542]. In this direction, small diffusion model rapidly generates preliminary structures or rough sketches, which the larger model subsequently refines and completes them. The division of tasks will reduce the computational load on the larger model, enhancing overall efficiency while preserving generation quality."
