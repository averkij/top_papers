While recent research has primarily focused on algorithmic advancementssuch as reducing computational overhead or strengthening reward models to mitigate reward hackingthe critical role of prompt-data construction and its scalability has received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we address this gap by systematically exploring data-driven bottlenecks that currently hinder RLHF performance scaling, focusing specifically on the challenges posed by reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. To mitigate reward hacking, we introduce hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and generative reward model (GenRM). This approach not only exhibits enhanced resistance to reward hacking, but also enables accurate assessment of responses against clearly defined ground-truth solutions. Additionally, in order to ensure response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness, we propose novel prompt-selection method named Pre-PPO, explicitly identifying training prompts that are inherently challenging and thus less prone to reward hacking. Furthermore, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks during the early phases of RLHF training significantly boosts performance, given that these tasks naturally encode finegrained response distinctions and possess clearly defined ground truths. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across two model sizes, we validate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed methods.

            "content": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences [1, 21, 27, 30]. RLHF has been fundamental in enabling 1 LLMs to generate responses that are more helpful, harmless, and honest. Despite the proposal of various non-RL algorithms such as DPO [24], state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT/GPT-4 [20, 30], Claude [2], and Gemini [28] continue to employ RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) for policy optimization. Recently, numerous studies [17, 26, 27, 32] have focused on enhancing the efficiency and performance of RLHF at the algorithmic level. Methods proposed include dropping the critic model from PPO to reduce computational overhead [17, 26, 32] and filtering noisy samples during the PPO sampling process to achieve more efficient training and improved performance [27]. Additionally, many papers [7, 14, 31] focus on leveraging the capability of the reward model to mitigate the reward hacking problem, thereby enhancing the performance of RLHF. However, there have been few studies [10] focusing on the construction of RLHF data (i.e., training prompts) and its performance scaling based on these training prompts. In this paper, we investigate the bottlenecks of data scaling in RLHF and propose novel methods for constructing training prompts and strategies to enhance RLHF performance. Through our research, we identify two primary bottlenecks in RL data scaling: reward hacking and the deterioration of model response diversity. To address the reward hacking challenge, we design reward system that combines both reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and generative reward model to validate model predictions against ground-truth responses (GenRM). Additionally, our analysis reveals that models predominantly learning coarse-grained differences among responses tend to suffer rapid loss of response diversity, thus overlooking valuable fine-grained distinctions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an innovative Pre-PPO prompt selection methodology that explicitly targets prompts posing greater learning challenges to the model, enabling more robust and effective data scaling. These strategically-chosen prompts contain rich fine-grained response variations, as demonstrated by subsequent analyses. Furthermore, we discover that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks during early stages of RLHF training consistently yields superior performance outcomes, as these task domains inherently involve fine-grained distinctions and exhibit greater resistance to reward hacking due to their clearly defined ground truths. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work in reward hacking, RLHF data construction, and RLHF performance scale analysis. Section 3 presents our analysis of factors that hinder RLHF performance scaling and introduces our methodology for improving RLHF performance through two key strategies: using Pre-PPO method that selects training prompts that are more challenging for the model to learn and prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks during early RLHF training stages. In Section 4, we conduct experiments using two distinct model sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and analyze its scalability. Additionally, we carry out comprehensive ablation study to investigate the individual impacts of our two proposed strategies on RLHF performance. Our results reveal that RTV exhibits the strongest resistance to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and finally GenRM relying on SFT Best-of-N responses (referred to as GenRM without ground truth in subsequent sections). Moreover, RTV consistently shows superior capabilities in identifying fine-grained response distinctions compared to GenRM with or without ground truth, and GenRM with ground truth further outperforms GenRM without ground truth. Notably, the proposed strategies facilitate early acquisition of fine-grained response distinctions during RLHF training, thereby significantly enhancing overall model performance. In Section 5, we discuss several intriguing open questions, including potential connections between our proposed methods and emerging approaches in long-form Chain-of-Thought RL scenarios."

            "content": "Reward hacking. Reward hacking occurs when an AI system exploits flaws in the reward function to maximize rewards without achieving the intended objectives. Consequently, the success of RLHF heavily depends on the quality of the reward model. Unfortunately, reward models often struggle to provide accurate scores due to three main challenges: 1) mis-specified reward modeling in representing human preferences [15, 23]; 2) the presence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in training datasets [3, 22]; and 3) poor generalization ability [19]. These inaccuracies in reward modeling have been identified as major contributors to reward hacking and hallucination in LLMs [12]. Recent work by Zhang et al. [33] introduced generative reward model (GenRM) to validate model predictions against ground-truth responses, demonstrating greater resistance to reward hacking and has been adopted by state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeekV3 [18]. Additionally, 2 Deepseek-R1 [9] developed reasoning task verifiers (RTV) that have proven effective in addressing reward hacking, particularly in mathematical, coding, and other reasoning tasks. While previous research has focused on improving the accuracy of reward models themselves, our work takes different approach: we aim to design an effective RLHF data construction method under robust reward system that combines both GenRM and RTV to mitigate the reward hacking problem. RLHF data construction. There are few works that focus on how to construct RL data (i.e., RL training prompts) to enhance RLHF performance. Gao et al. [6] propose principled data selection method for the DPO algorithm, where they find overly difficult data hinder alignment and filter out such challenging instances during DPO training. Additionally, Li et al. [16] introduce strategic selection method to identify key training prompts from complete prompt set, achieving comparable RLHF performance while using only subset of the data. While these methods demonstrate that careful dataset curation can match or exceed the performance of training on complete datasets, there remains significant gap in understanding the factors that limit RL data scaling in PPO-based training. Specifically, no existing work has systematically analyzed how to select and structure training prompts to substantially improve model performance when using the PPO algorithm. RLHF performance scale analysis. Recent studies have increasingly focused on analyzing RLHF [3, 5, 10], particularly examining its generalization ability and response diversity. Kirk et al. [13] demonstrate that RLHF exhibits superior generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on novel inputs, especially as the distribution shift between training and testing data increases. However, they also observe that RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across various metrics, suggesting fundamental trade-off between generalization and diversity in current LLM fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, several recent works [8, 25] investigate how RLHF can effectively distill the best responses as evaluated by reward models, proposing various algorithms to enhance this distillation capability. In our study, we similarly observe that the diminishment of response diversity impedes RLHF scaling, particularly when models attempt to learn coarse differences among responses. Additionally, our findings indicate that RLHF performance is only comparable to the strategy of sampling five responses from the SFT model and then selecting the highest-ranked one according to the reward model (i.e., SFT Bo5). This observation motivates further investigation into methods for enhancing the effectiveness of RLHF."

            "content": "As shown in Figure 1, our RLHF pipeline consists of three main stages: Initial Supervised Fine-tuning: We first fine-tune the pre-trained language model on human-written demonstrations to achieve basic instruction-following capabilities. Reward Model Training: We prepare three types of reward models: the Bradley-Terry Reward Model (BT Model), the Generative Reward Model (GenRM), and Reasoning Task Verifiers (RTV). The BT model learns reward functions using pairwise comparison data, optimizing parameters via maximum likelihood estimation to infer underlying reward scores from human preferences. The Generative Reward Model (GenRM) is trained using Pairwise Reward Modeling (pairRM), where the model learns from human preference judgments of paired outputs [11]. Rather than assigning individual scores to each output, GenRM directly predicts comparative score for each pair, optimizing these pairwise comparisons to align closely with human evaluations. To provide GenRM with reliable ground truth for comparison, we collect explicit ground-truth answers for reasoning tasks. For other task types, we utilize the trained BT Reward Model to select the best outcome from candidate samples generated by the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model. For RTV, we construct series of specialized verifiers to directly validate the correctness of model responses for specific tasks. These include, for example, code sandboxes for programming tasks, which can execute and evaluate code outputs in real-time. Reinforcement Learning Optimization: We leverage combination of GenRM and RTV to provide comprehensive feedback for optimizing the language model through PPO. This process is guided by Figure 1 Overview of the RLHF Training Framework. Our proposed pipeline consists of two sequential phases: (1) Reward Model Training, where we construct three complementary reward modelsnamely, the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, the Generative Reward Model (GenRM), and Reasoning Task Verifiers (RTV). Specifically, the BT model is trained on pairwise comparisons to capture human preferences, while the GenRM assigns explicit reward scores aligned with these preferences using either ground-truth solutions (for reasoning tasks) or the best-of-N selections identified by the BT model (for general tasks). The RTV component implements specialized validators tailored to specific task requirements, such as code-execution sandboxes for evaluating programming tasks; and (2) Reinforcement Learning Optimization, in which the language model is iteratively optimized using PPO under guidance from both GenRM and RTV. This stage leverages carefully selected training prompts identified through our Pre-PPO prompt-selection method and employs strategic optimization techniques to robustly enhance model performance and alignment. carefully curated training prompts and well-crafted training strategy. The iterative nature of this approach progressively refines the models outputs by maximizing predicted reward scores while ensuring minimal deviation from its original policy. During RL training, we have two observations: Reward hacking: As shown in Figure 2, the overall performance of the model undergoing RLHF demonstrates an initial rise followed by subsequent decline during the training process. Specifically, abilities in mathematics, creative tasks, and instruction following all exhibit this pattern of improvement followed by deterioration. Our analysis reveals that reward hacking occurs across these tasks, wherein the model learns to generate responses containing certain syntactic patterns that artificially inflate reward scores, rather than genuinely improving task performance. The deterioration of model response diversity: During the RLHF training process, we observe continuous decline in the entropy of model responses (illustrated in subfigure (a) of Figure 12 in the Appendix), indicating decrease in response diversity. While iterated RLHF can be employed to mitigate the reward hacking problem, the deterioration of model response diversity emerges as critical factor limiting the performance scaling of RLHF. This reduction in diversity not only constrains the models ability to generate varied and creative outputs but also potentially hampers its adaptability to diverse tasks and contexts. Despite numerous efforts to address the issues of reward hacking and diminishing response diversity, including approaches like iterated RLHF [3, 29] and reinforcement learning from pre-trained models [4, 9], we find that these problems remain stubbornly resistant to complete resolution. Recognizing the persistent nature of these challenges, we have instead focused our efforts on developing novel approach. Our strategy involves carefully designed data construction methods and an optimized training strategy aimed at enhancing RLHF 4 performance before these two problems can significantly impede model improvement during the RLHF process. This proactive strategy allows us to maximize the benefits of RLHF while mitigating its potential drawbacks, leading to more robust and sustained model enhancements. Figure 2 Overall test scores from the initial run using an expanded dataset combining newly collected data (six million prompts) with the original dataset (one million prompts). Despite increasing dataset size substantially, RLHF did not yield improvements in performance. Additionally, the best performance was observed at around the 3,500-step mark, after which test scores gradually declined."

            "content": "Reward Analysis of Newly Collected Prompts. We investigated why newly collected prompts did not improve RLHF performance by analyzing their reward scores. As illustrated in Figure 3, approximately 90% of these prompts obtained reward scores greater than 0.5 on scale of 0 to 1. In this distribution, score of 0.5 indicates that the models output is on par with the reference, while scores above 0.5 suggest superior performance. Our GenRM is trained to compare the model response with the ground truth in reasoning tasks and SFT Best-of-N responses in other tasks. Therefore, scores above 0.5 imply that the model-generated outputs were judged as superior to these presumed optimal responses. However, after careful manual inspection, we discovered that substantial portion of these high-scoring outputs exhibited reward hacking behavior and were qualitatively worse than the original best-selected responses. Moreover, we observed direct correlation between the magnitude of the reward score and the severity and frequency of reward hacking instances. The higher the reward score, the more severe and frequent the reward hacking issue became. This finding reveals critical limitation in our current reward model and underscores the need for more robust evaluation metrics that can effectively distinguish between genuine improvements and instances of reward hacking. Selecting Prompts with Lower Reward Model Scores for RL Training. Given the observations above, we designed selection algorithm called Pre-PPO, which explicitly identifies prompts with lower reward model scores for use in the initial PPO experiment. These low-scoring prompts are both more challenging for the model to learn from and less susceptible to reward hacking. Finally, we combined these selected prompts 5 Figure 3 Distribution of reward scores for newly collected prompts. The x-axis shows the percentage of prompts. The y-axis represents the reward score range from 0 to 1, with 0.5 indicating parity with the reference. Approximately 90% of prompts received scores above 0.5 for both small-size and large-size models, suggesting apparent superiority over reference outputs. However, manual inspection revealed that many high-scoring outputs exhibited reward hacking behavior and were qualitatively inferior to the original best-selected outcomes. with the original prompt dataset to retrain the RL model. Additionally, recognizing that reward model scores exhibit distinct distributions across different task domains, we normalize these scores within each domain before performing prompt selection."

Prompts: Our original dataset consists of one million training prompts collected from publicly available sources and through human annotation. These prompts span diverse domains, including mathematics, coding, instruction-following, creative writing, logical reasoning, and other related tasks. To expand our dataset, we additionally collected five million new prompts primarily from open-source resources, 6 Figure 4 The distribution of prompts across both math and coding task during the training phases primarily covering mathematics, coding, instruction-following, and creative writing tasks. (The detailed distribution of our training prompts is illustrated in Figure 13 in the Appendix.) Experimental Details of Pre-PPO: As shown in Figure 2, we first combine the newly collected prompts with the original prompts to construct the training prompt set for the initial run. Then, as illustrated in Figure 3, we select only the bottom 10% of prompts based on their scores assigned by the generative reward model. This prompt selection process is conducted using the small-sized model. To reduce computational costs, we do not repeat this process on the large-sized model. Experimental Details of Prioritizing Mathematical and Coding Tasks. Since performance on coding tasks is measured via unit tests, which are more robust and less susceptible to reward hacking compared to math tasks, we leverage this property by assigning higher proportion of coding-related prompts during the early stages of RLHF training. Specifically, we begin training exclusively on coding prompts, gradually introduce mathematical prompts, and ultimately utilize the complete mixed-domain training dataset. The distribution of math and coding prompts throughout the training process is presented in Figure 4. Evaluations: We constructed comprehensive evaluation set covering multiple skill areas, including logical reasoning, instruction-following (IF), STEM tasks, coding, natural language processing (NLP), knowledge, contextual understanding (CU), and out-of-distribution generalization (OOD). Our evaluation set consists of two versions (V1.0 and V2.0), which share some overlapping prompts; however, the newly introduced prompts in V2.0 are notably more challenging than those in V1.0.

Due to computational constraints, all subsequent experiments, except for those analyzing scaling trends with respect to model size, are conducted exclusively using the small-sized model. Prompt Selection with Pre-PPO. The experimental results depicted in Figure 5 reveal that the Pre-PPO method achieves comparable performance to the baseline approach up to the 2000-step mark in the training process. Notably, Pre-PPO demonstrates continued improvement between 2000 and 4000 steps, whereas the baseline performance plateaus. This sustained enhancement suggests that the prompts selected through Pre-PPO are more resistant to \"hacking\", thereby fostering continued learning and ultimately boosting the effectiveness of RLHF. Impact of Early Training Emphasis on Mathematical and Coding Tasks. As shown in Figure 5, early training 9 Figure 6 Early emphasis on mathematical and coding tasks significantly improves RLHF performance in both coding and STEM areas on Testset-V1.0. Notably, the coding performance with this approach surpasses the baseline within just 1000 training steps.

The graph shows the overall RLHF performance as the percentage of newly collected training data increases from 10% to 20% and 50%. Counter-intuitively, increasing the amount of training data leads to noticeable degradation in performance, suggesting that high-quality training prompts are scarce in real-world settings and that simply scaling data quantity does not guarantee improvement. emphasis on mathematical and coding tasks can improve the overall performance of RLHF. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 6, early emphasis on mathematical and coding tasks during training significantly enhances both the coding and STEM performance of RLHF models. Notably, in the coding task, the early training emphasis method surpasses the baseline performance plateau as early as the 1000-step mark. This improvement demonstrates the efficacy of prioritizing these foundational skills in the initial stages of training, leading to accelerated learning and superior overall performance. Performance Scaling Trends of Model Size. We also investigated the scalability of both Pre-PPO and early emphasis on mathematical and coding tasks to larger models. As shown in Table 1, our method demonstrates direct applicability to large-scale models, achieving significantly better performance than the baseline. This indicates positive scaling trend with respect to model size. Additionally, we investigated the individual performance of Pre-PPO and early emphasis strategies on mathematical and coding tasks when applied to large models. Due to computational constraints, we focused on applying the Pre-PPO strategy (using data selected from the small-size model) to the large model for dataset selection in our ablation study. As shown in Table 3, Pre-PPO yields significant performance improvement in large models. Similarly, emphasizing mathematical and coding tasks early in the training process of large models results in substantial performance gains in both STEM and coding evaluations. However, this approach yields only marginal improvements in overall performance. These results demonstrate that both strategies can be effectively scaled to larger model sizes, showing positive performance scaling trend. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explore how hyperparameters should be adjusted when scaling from small to large models to maximize performance gains. This investigation could potentially unlock even greater improvements in large-scale model performance. Data Scaling in the Pre-PPO Strategy. We investigated the effect of data scaling within the Pre-PPO strategy, as shown in Figure 8. However, increasing the amount of newly collected training data from 10% to 20% or 50% led to noticeable degradation in overall RLHF performance. This counter-intuitive result suggests that high-quality training prompts are scarce in real-world settings, and simply scaling the quantity of collected data does not necessarily lead to improvements. In future work, we will explore approaches to generating prompts directly from large language models (LLMs) themselves, which we consider more promising direction than relying purely on real-world collections. 11 Figure 9 Data Scale method boost both math and code performance."

            "content": "Although we have demonstrated the effectiveness and positive scaling trend of our method, we aim to further explore the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its success. Specifically, we seek to understand why our approach enhances the performance of RLHF and how it breaks through two critical bottlenecks: reward hacking and the deterioration of model response diversity. Reward Hacking Problems Across Different Reward Models. Aside from perfect verifiers, any reward model used during RLHF can potentially be hacked. However, as shown in Figure 7, we observe that: For tasks evaluated using RTV, test scores continued to improve throughout the entire RLHF training period. This sustained improvement suggests that RTV provides robust and hack-resistant feedback. When using GenRM with ground truth data, we observed consistent score improvements up to approximately the 2800th training step. This indicates that GenRM maintains its effectiveness as feedback mechanism for significant portion of the training process. In contrast, the BT reward model (or GenRM utilizing responses selected by Best-of-N sampling (BoN) from the SFT model) showed improvements only up to the 2100th training step, after which the test scores began to decline. This downturn indicates that the BT reward model or GenRM with SFT BoN response might be more susceptible to issues such as overfitting or reward hacking in later stages of training. Accordingly, in our proposed approach, we increase the number of prompts allocated to RTV-supervised tasks and place an early emphasis on mathematical and coding tasks, supervised respectively by GenRM (with ground-truth data) and RTV. We anticipate that this strategy will enable the model to achieve optimal overall performance across various task types: those supervised by RTV, those supervised by GenRM with ground truth references, and those supervised by GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. This approach is expected to yield the best combined results, especially by allowing the model to reach peak performance on tasks in the last category before reward-hacking issues emerge. Early Acquisition of Fine-Grained Response Differences Enhances Performance Scaling. Although the observed overall performance improvement can be partially explained by mitigating reward hacking issues associated with tasks supervised by GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses, the specific performance boost in mathematical and coding tasks still merits further investigation. As illustrated in Figure 9, our Data Scale method achieves substantially better performance on math and coding tasks compared to the initial run. Notably, this improvement occurs despite our method utilizing roughly the same number of prompts for mathematical and coding tasks as in the initial run. 12 Figure 10 Comparison of Reward Model Scores across Different Edit Distance Bins for GenRM with and without Ground Truth. Accordingly, we first analyze the types of prompts filtered by the Pre-PPO strategy. To conduct this analysis, we collect five responses per prompt, compute the maximum edit distance among these responses, and then categorize the prompts into separate bins based on these maximum edit distances. Next, we calculate the average normalized reward model score for each bin. In our view, the edit distance between responses can reflect the granularity of their differences to some extentlarger edit distances indicate coarser-grained differences, whereas smaller distances suggest finer-grained distinctions. As illustrated in Figure 10, we have the following observations and findings: Prompts supervised by GenRM with ground truth (e.g., mathematical and logical tasks) and those supervised by GenRM without ground truth (e.g., creative writing and cosplay tasks) exhibit distinctly different trends in normalized reward-model scores as the edit distance varies. These trends highlight fundamental differences in how the model learns across task types: for tasks supervised by GenRM without ground truth, the model readily captures coarse-grained differences; whereas for tasks supervised by GenRM with ground truth, the model shows greater sensitivity to fine-grained distinctions. In the Pre-PPO strategy, we explicitly exclude prompts that exhibit fine-grained response differences in mathematical and logical tasks, as well as those reflecting coarse-grained differences in creative writing and cosplay tasks. subsequent ablation study suggests that reintroducing the previously excluded mathematical and logical prompts still delivers marginal improvements in overall performance. This finding implies that learning coarse-grained patterns from creative writing and cosplay tasks negatively impacts the scalability of RLHF data. We hypothesize that emphasizing mathematical and coding tasks during early training may also guide the model towards capturing fine-grained distinctions first, thereby mitigating potential adverse effects from prematurely learning coarse-grained patterns. Furthermore, we analyze how reward score differences vary across prompt bins categorized by their maximum edit distances for different reward models. As shown in 11, both GenRM with ground truth and RTV assign larger score differences within bins corresponding to smaller edit distances. Conversely, GenRM without ground truth fails to produce meaningful score differences within these lower edit-distance bins. These results suggest that reward models leveraging ground truth data or verification feedback demonstrate stronger sensitivity to fine-grained response variations compared to models trained without explicit ground truth supervision. Moreover, when directly comparing RTV and GenRM equipped with ground truth data, RTV 13 exhibits consistently larger score differences at low edit distances, highlighting RTVs enhanced capability in capturing subtle response distinctions. Figure 11 Comparison of Score Difference across Different Edit Distance Bins for GenRM with and without Ground Truth, and RTV. Deterioration of Model Response Diversity. Finally, we compare the model response entropy between the baseline method and our proposed method. As illustrated in Figure 12 in the Appendix, the response entropy for creative writing and cosplay tasks is higher in our approach compared to the baseline. In contrast, our method achieves lower response entropy for mathematics, coding, and other reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that removing coarse-grained pattern prompts from tasks supervised by GenRM without ground truth alleviates the decline in model response diversity typically observed during RLHF. This strategy thus enables the model to better capture fine-grained differences in reasoning task responses, thereby enhancing the data-scaling effectiveness of RLHF."

            "content": "Q1: Do prompts with large edit distances negatively impact model performance, and should the model avoid learning from them? A1: Actually, prompts with larger edit distances (coarse-grained variations) and smaller edit distances (finegrained variations) both contribute positively to improving the model. However, prioritizing coarse-grained (large edit distance) data early in training can adversely affect the models ability to effectively learn finegrained (small edit distance) distinctions later. Ideally, we want the model to thoroughly master fine-grained variations first before transitioning to learning from coarse-grained data. Q2: The O1 series method introduces long chain-of-thought (CoT) responses, which theoretically increases the edit distance of all response pairs. Why is this approach still effective? A2: The \"O1 series\" can essentially be viewed as transforming all fine-grained differences into sufficiently large, coarse-grained ones. By doing this, the model can more clearly categorize and generalize variations across different granularities. Personally, this approach seems like comprehensive solution for handling varying levels of granularity. However, we acknowledge that there might exist deeper insights or interpretations beyond our current understanding. Q3: According to this analysis, should we first train our models on data with smaller edit distance variations (fine-grained responses), and later on data with larger edit distance variations (coarse-grained responses)? 14 A3: We havent conducted experiments as detailed as this due to several practical considerations. Edit distance is merely coarse proxy for defining granularity levels, and its computational overhead is quite high. Hence, its suitable for exploratory understanding rather than as practical training strategy. Nevertheless, we have performed similar strategy experiment in which tasks with abundant fine-grained variations (such as math and coding tasks) are trained first, followed by broader, coarsely-varied data later on. This approach demonstrated improved final performance. Importantly, this improvement depends heavily on the capacity of the verifier and GenRM with ground truth to accurately perceive fine-grained variations. Q4: What practical insights does this analysis provide us? A4: The concept of \"fine-grained control\" was initially highlighted by Anthropic when introducing Constitutional AI (CAI) [4]. The creation of CAI was inspired by the realization that methods such as Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) alone cannot directly capture human-preferred, fine-grained distinctions. To address this limitation, Anthropic proposed CAI, which explicitly encourages generative reward models (Gen-RM) to become sensitive to subtle aspects of prompts and responses. For example, CAI aims to help models detect subtle prompt-level linguistic nuancessuch as differences between requests for \"critical reviews\" versus just \"reviews\"as well as recognize sophisticated vocabulary that enhances response quality, exemplified by Claude frequently using poetic phrases like \"moonlight as in dream\" in literary creation tasks. Therefore, moving forward, we can build upon these insights by carefully constructing CAI-style humanistic datasets aimed specifically at training GenRMs without ground truth to perceive subtle, fine-grained distinctions. Subsequently, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques could then leverage these enhanced reward models, progressively improving their capability for fine-grained control over generated responses."

            "title": "7 Conclusion",
            "content": "In this paper, we have explored the bottlenecks that hinder effective data scaling in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), identifying two significant challenges: reward hacking and reduced diversity of model responses. To address these obstacles, we proposed novel approach involving strategic construction of training prompts and an innovative early-stage training prioritization strategy. Specifically, we introduced combined reward system incorporating Reasoning Task Verifiers (RTV) and Generative Reward Models with ground-truth supervision (GenRM) to enhance resistance against reward hacking. In addition, we proposed the Pre-PPO prompt selection strategy, specifically designed to identify and prioritize more challenging training prompts that help the model effectively capture fine-grained response distinctions. Our findings indicate that careful curation of the training prompt set can mitigate the decline in response diversity for tasks supervised by GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses, thus improving the scalability and efficiency of RLHF data use. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in the training process, as these tasks naturally contain clearly defined ground truths and fine-grained distinctions, significantly enhances training robustness and overall model performance. Our analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of these novel strategies: RTV supervision demonstrate the highest resistance to reward hacking and greater ability to capture fine-grained differences, followed by GenRM with ground-truth labels, and subsequently the BT Reward Model. By enabling models to identify such fine-grained differences early in the training process, our proposed method substantially improves overall model performance and scalability. We hope this work lays the foundation for future research to further optimize RLHF data construction strategies and inspires more principled approaches for addressing reward hacking and enhancing model alignment."

Such decline not only constrains the models capability to produce varied and creative outputs but may also negatively impact its adaptability and generalization across diverse tasks and contexts. Additionally, we analyze the entropy across various task categories and observe that tasks associated with creative writing, role-play, and others supervised by GenRM without ground truth exhibit notably higher entropy than tasks involving mathematical, coding, and logical reasoning skillstasks that typically are supervised by GenRM with ground truth. We compare response entropy between the baseline and our proposed method in subfigures (b), (c), and (d), categorizing the results according to the reward model types: GenRM with ground truth, GenRM without ground truth, and RTV. We observe that, for tasks supervised by GenRM with ground truth or RTV, the response diversity using our method is lower than that of the baseline. In contrast, for tasks supervised by GenRM without ground truth, our method exhibits higher response entropy compared to the baseline. These observations indicate that our proposed method effectively guides the model to focus more explicitly on tasks supervised by RTV and GenRM with ground truth, thus enabling the model to acquire more fine-grained response distinctions during RLHF training.

The urgency of advancing waste sorting efforts is undeniable . Challenges in Implementing Waste Sorting Lack of Public Awareness and Habits considerable portion of urban residents lack sufficient knowledge about waste sorting . Many are unsure how to properly categorize different types of waste - - - such as distinguishing between hazardous , recyclable , and other waste . Even among those who understand the basics , deeply ingrained habits of mixed waste disposal are difficult to change in the 26 short term . Some residents find sorting cumbersome and lack motivation to participate , leading to careless disposal . These issues in awareness and behavior make it difficult to enforce effective waste sorting at the source . Inadequate Infrastructure In some cities , waste sorting facilities are insufficient . Trash bins are not set up according to strict sorting standards , or their labels are unclear , making proper disposal confusing for residents . Additionally , the `` sort - then - mix ' ' phenomenon occurs during waste collection and transportation - - - some areas have sorted bins , but collection trucks mix all waste together , rendering residents ' efforts meaningless and discouraging participation . Furthermore , terminal waste treatment facilities face shortcomings , such as underdeveloped recycling systems and lack of specialized hazardous waste disposal methods , preventing sorted waste from being properly processed . Weak Enforcement and Supervision of Regulations Although many regions have introduced waste sorting laws and regulations , enforcement remains inconsistent . Penalties for non - compliance are often too lenient to serve as an effective deterrent .

C.3 Case 3 - Coding Knowledge We present case study demonstrating our models enhanced response quality, characterized by better information accuracy and content richness, as exemplified by the provided code sample (line 12-23). <-- PROMPT --> The line aipc_data_dir . encode ( ' utf -8 ') encodes string into UTF -8 formatted byte sequence . What are the benefits of this ? <-- RESPONSE OF OUR MODEL --> ** Encoding strings into UTF -8 byte sequences offers several key benefits in Python and broader programming contexts :** 1. ** Broad Compatibility **: UTF -8 is widely accepted and supported character encoding standard . It is the most common encoding on the internet , with nearly all modern operating systems , programming languages , and applications supporting it . This ensures reliable data transmission and processing across different systems , avoiding garbled text due to encoding incomp atibilit ies . For example , when transmitting 28 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 1 2 3 4 5 text data in web applications , UTF -8 is the standard encoding , correctly interpreted by browsers , servers , and other components . 2. ** Variable - Length Encoding **: UTF -8 uses variable - length encoding scheme , representing characters with 1 to 4 bytes . For ASCII characters ( basic Latin letters , numbers , and symbols ) , UTF -8 uses single byte , maintaining compatibility with ASCII . For non - ASCII characters , it uses 2 to 4 bytes as needed . This efficiency makes UTF -8 ideal for storage and transmission , especially when the data contains many ASCII characters . 3. ** Multilingual Support **: UTF -8 can represent nearly all global writing systems , including letters , symbols , Chinese , Japanese , Korean , and more . This makes it perfect for inte rnationalized and multilingual applications . Regardless of the language , UTF -8 provides unified encoding solution . 4. ** Backward Compatibility **: Since UTF -8 encodes ASCII characters identically to ASCII , it maintains backward compatibility with legacy ASCII - based systems . This allows seamless upgrades to support broader character sets without disrupting existing infrastructure . ### Example Code : ``` python # Define string containing Chinese characters aipc_data_dir = \" hello , world \" # Encode the string into UTF -8 byte sequence encoded_data = aipc_data_dir . encode ( ' utf -8 ') print ( encoded_data ) # Decode the UTF -8 byte sequence back to string decoded_data = encoded_data . decode ( ' utf -8 ') print ( decoded_data ) ``` This example demonstrates encoding Chinese string into UTF -8 bytes and decoding it back , showcasing UTF -8 ' reliability in handling multilingual text . In summary , UTF -8 encoding is robust and universal choice , ensuring smooth data exchange across systems . Whether for web development , text processing , or system interoperability , UTF -8 remains trusted standard . <-- RESPONSE OF BASELINE MODEL --> The primary benefits of encoding strings into UTF -8 byte sequences are as follows : 1. Universality and Compatibility Cross - platform Support : UTF -8 is universal character encoding standard supported by nearly all modern operating systems , programming languages , and network protocols . Data encoded in UTF -8 can be properly processed across Windows , Linux , and macOS systems . For example , text file stored with UTF -8 encoding on Linux server can be read on 29 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Windows client without garbled characters , as Windows systems equally support UTF -8 encoding . Multilingual Capability : UTF -8 can represent characters from nearly all writing systems worldwide , covering languages from different countries and regions . Whether it ' English , Chinese , Arabic , Japanese , or others , UTF -8 can encode them all . This makes UTF -8 highly practical for handling multilingual content , such as in internationalized websites or software applications . For instance , global - commerce platform dealing with product descriptions and user comments in various languages can rely on UTF -8 encoding to ensure proper storage and display of all text . 2. Network Transmission Efficiency : UTF -8 offers efficiency advantages in network transmission . For ASCII characters ( basic English letters , numbers , and common symbols ) , UTF -8 encoding uses only 1 byte , identical to traditional ASCII encoding , ensuring no additional overhead when transmitting English text . For non - ASCII characters , UTF -8 uses 2 to 4 bytes depending on the character . Compared to fixed - length encodings like UTF -16 ( which typically uses 2 or 4 bytes for all characters ) , UTF -8 may occupy less space when transmitting text containing predominantly ASCII characters , thereby improving network efficiency . For example , when transmitting an English news article with minimal Chinese content , UTF -8 encoded text consumes less bandwidth than UTF -16 encoded text . Protocol Support : Many network protocols , such as HTTP , SMTP , and POP3 , default to or recommend UTF -8 encoding . When transmitting web content via HTTP , using UTF -8 ensures that all characters ( including text in different languages and special symbols ) are correctly parsed and displayed by browsers . 3. Data Storage Space Efficiency : As mentioned earlier , UTF -8 uses 1 byte for ASCII characters and typically 3 bytes for common Chinese characters . Compared to fixed - length encodings like UCS -4 ( which uses 4 bytes per character ) , UTF -8 can significantly reduce storage space for text containing large amounts of ASCII or commonly used characters . This is particularly important for databases and file systems storing substantial text data . For example , in database table storing user comments , UTF -8 encoding can dramatically reduce storage requirements and lower costs compared to UCS -4 encoding . Flexibility : UTF -8 ' variable - length encoding provides great flexibility in storing different types of characters . It dynamically allocates bytes based on actual character requirements , meeting the need to represent all characters while minimizing space usage for common ones ."
