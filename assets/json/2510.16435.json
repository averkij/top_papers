They are now starting to be deployed in complex and dynamic environments shared with humans. Examples include robots in healthcare and assisted living [47], or in the service industry, for instance, in restaurants [18]. When inhabiting the same space as people and executing tasks for or with them, natural language communication becomes essential. Language now also plays central role in instructing robots, as in the case of visionlanguageaction models (VLAs). VLAs are large visionlanguage models fine-tuned to output robot actions given language instruction [46]. Widely publicized VLA demos often feature household tasks, such as cleaning or tidying up further areas with ample human contact. When interacting with such robot, users might naturally have many questions for the robot. For example, users may want to Authors Contact Information: Lennart Wachowiak, lennart.wachowiak@kcl.ac.uk, London, Kings College London, CDT in Safe and Trusted AI, UK; Andrew Coles, Kings College London, London, UK; Gerard Canal, Kings College London, London, UK; Oya Celiktutan, Kings College London, London, UK. 1 5 2 0 2 8 1 ] .

Due to the rise in text generation capabilities [1, 8], giving natural language answers to user questions is easier than ever. However, for the answers to be truthful, they must be based on the robots true capabilities, underlying decision-making, and execution traces. If the robots question-answering module lacks this data, large language model (LLM) might simply confabulate the answers [21]. Without having relevant logs and access to run explainability methods, the LLMs answers can devolve into statistically likely language patterns unrelated to reality. Therefore, roboticists need to know what data should be accessible to such question-answering module. With this paper, we provide novel large-scale dataset of questions users have for household robots. Our dataset enables roboticists to see what questions their robot might need to answer. Second, these questions will help roboticists understand what type of data needs to be collected by the robot during task execution and made accessible to the natural language interface. Third, the dataset and its question categories can serve as strong foundation, grounded in real user needs, for benchmarking XAI and question-answering systems. Beyond providing the dataset, our paper addresses the following research questions in an exploratory manner: RQ1: What type of user questions should service robots be able to answer? RQ2: What type of questions do users consider especially important? RQ3: Do the types of questions and the importance the user places on the robots question-answering capabilities vary with the users robot experience and attitudes towards robots? Our main findings and contributions can be summarized as follows: We provide dataset of 1,893 user questions. We have hierarchically categorized the questions into 12 main categories and 70 subcategories (RQ1). The resulting categories show wide variety of question types, many of which are underexplored in the current explainable robotics literature. Beyond the causal why-questions often explored in XAI, the categories include questions about execution details, the robots capabilities, how and if it can handle potential difficulties, technical details of the robot, the robots source of knowledge, and many more. We find that users assign different levels of importance to different question categories (RQ2). However, unifying theme is that questions about safety, failure, and potential issues rank highly. Questions about how the robot would deal with hypothetical scenarios and how it ensures its actions are correct rank highest. In contrast, the why-questions popular in XAI literature have the second-lowest average importance score. We find that users with more positive attitudes towards robots also think it is more important for robots to be able to answer their questions (RQ3). Additionally, we find that the types of questions asked differ based on persons level of experience with robots. Novices used larger allocation of their questions to ask about execution details and the state of the environment. In contrast, more experienced users were more likely to ask questions about how the robot would deal with potentially difficult situations or how it makes decisions. 2 Related Work 2.1 Explainable AI/Robotics Explainability has become core topic in the robotics [3, 42], AI planning [14], and machine learning [2] literature. By providing the reasons for the robots actions and decisions, explanations are supposed to: enable users to understand the robots decision-making and be better at predicting future behavior [9, 50], allow users to calibrate their trust levels appropriately [3, 13, 32, 54], What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics 3 improve humanagent team performance due to enhanced knowledge transfer [54], and improve how an agent is perceived [7]. myriad of XAI modules for robots and agents have been developed in the past, typically focusing on specific functionalities of the robot, such as explainable vision [5], classical planning [6, 14], or motion modules [4]. As in our work, previous research has also emphasized the importance of considering user needs and requirements when developing XAI modules, for example, through participatory design [10, 11, 37, 50]. For instance, Gebellí et al. ran co-design study in geriatric unit to understand how to meet the needs of nurses in making robot legible and explainable [17]. With the rise of LLMs (e.g., [1, 19]), these explainability modules can interface with users through natural language. LLMs are now used to answer various user questions by retrieving relevant information from logs or specific XAI modules and synthesizing answers. For example, Sobrín-Hidalgo et al. [43] propose to collect the execution logs of robot module in vector database. Once the robot is asked to answer an explanation-seeking question, an LLM provides the answer using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), thus querying the relevant bits from the database and summarizing the logs for the user. Moreover, Gebellí et al. [16] use LLMs to build user profile based on past interactions so that the generated explanations align more closely with that users mental model. Lastly, LeMasurier et al. [29] compare LLM-generated with templated explanations, for robot controlled via behavior tree [45]. However, the user questions that can be answered depend on the information available to the LLM. Being aware of all possible user questions and their respective importance and frequency is crucial to developing robots that log the right data (so that the LLM is less likely to confabulate it) and implement relevant XAI methods. 2.2 Question Categorizations In our previous work, we categorized the robot modules (e.g., navigation, manipulation, vision, etc.) for which explainability modules have been developed in the explainable robotics literature [51]. Furthermore, we provided categorization of situations, often caused by an interaction rupture or unexpected event, in which users demand an explanation from the robot (e.g., robot errors, uncertainty, suboptimal behavior) [53]. While these taxonomies provide us with insights into the HRI contexts in which questions are asked, in this work, we present dataset of concrete natural language questions users ask in variety of household-related robotics tasks. McGuinness et al. [34] present categorization of user questions in the context of software agent supporting the purchase of laptop. However, the resulting taxonomy is less detailed than what we present in the following; they provide no dataset of natural language questions, and the topic is not concerned with robotics. Raza et al. [40] explore what questions users ask robots in the context of users encountering robot at universitys open day. The 179 questions asked by users were either standard conversation openers (e.g., How are you?), or were concerned with facts and opinions about the university, general facts, or the robot itself (personality, beliefs, goals, abilities). In contrast, our study focuses on users encountering robot executing specific task, rather than social small talk setting. We prompt the users to ask questions related to the robot in the task context, as we are not interested in creating dataset of questions in the context of social chit-chat, such as What is your favorite movie? or How is the weather today?. Lastly, our study provides dataset that is more than 10 times larger and is coded into categories relevant to researchers building XAI and question-answering modules, enabling users to better understand the robot. Additionally, there exists small set of natural language corpora of humanrobot dialogues. For instance, the SCOUT corpus consists of users instructing remote robot to explore its environment [31], or the Vernissage Corpus consists 4 Wachowiak et al. of conversations in which robot talks about paintings and subsequently quizzes people about them [23]. However, these corpora and interactions are not designed to analyze users questions for the robot. 3 Method How the Dataset was Collected 3.1 Study Procedure Participants were recruited on Prolific, from where they accessed our questionnaire created in Qualtrics. The questionnaire form is publicly available (see Appendix A). After reading an information sheet and consent form, each participant was required to watch four or five video scenarios and read two text scenarios. The stimuli order was randomized. Videos and texts were randomly selected out of larger pool of 22 stimuli described in Section 3.2. After encountering video or text scenario, users had to provide natural language questions they would want to ask the robot. Specifically, users answered the following prompt: What questions would you want the robot to be able to answer about its behavior related to the task? Please provide questions directly related to what you saw in the video. Importantly, we are looking for questions in response to which the robot has to explain itself and its behavior. We do not look for general questions about the world, such as How is the weather? Based on this prompt, each user had to provide two questions. We collected two further questions with the following prompt: Beyond questions related directly to the video, what type of questions about its task and behavior do you think robot like in the video should be able to answer? In addition, users also provided importance scores for their questions, answering the following question on Likert scale from 1 (Not at all important) to 5 (extremely important): How important is it to you that robot you interact with can answer such question? In the end, users provided some demographic data and filled out 10-item questionnaire on peoples general attitudes towards robots. The attitude scores are measured via the recent, validated GAToRS questionnaire [27], using the two positive subscales (7-point Likert scales) for personal-level and societal-level attitudes toward robots. An example of statement probing societal-level attitudes towards robots is Robots are good thing for society, because they help people. An example of statement probing personal-level attitudes towards robots is would feel relaxed talking with robot. 3.2 Video and Text Stimuli To determine the types of questions users have for robots assisting them with everyday tasks, we present users with video or text scenarios. Videos. The videos depict robots accomplishing multistep tasks in home, for example, making the bed and then removing trash from the floor. Table 1 describes each videos content and provides an example frame. The videos were What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics 5 sourced from publicly available robot demos, either teleoperated or featuring state-of-the-art policies. The original videos are cut to show the execution of one self-contained task, such as making specific meal. Specifically, we included videos from Googles Gemini Robotics [46], Physical Intelligence [22], the Mobile ALOHA project [15], Figure1, Astribot2, Hello Robot3, and 1X4. The average video length was 35.4 seconds (SD=13.8). Links to the original, uncut videos can be found in Appendix B. Texts. In addition to the videos, we wrote six text reports of robots actions while its user was away. As with the videos, users were asked to write down the questions they might have for the robot in this scenario. An example text scenario is the following: Imagine you have robot at home that takes care of various household tasks. After returning from work, you check what your robot did today. It presents you with the following list. 1. moved from the living room to the kitchen. 2. In the kitchen, cleaned the dishes. 3. moved from the kitchen to the living room. 4. In the living room, picked up various items and put them back where they belong. 5. In the living room, cleaned the windows. 6. returned to my charging station. list of all text scenarios used can be found online (see Appendix A). 3.3 Participants The final dataset consists of 1,893 questions from 100 participants. This excludes participants who failed any attention check or gave nonsense answers in the free-text input fields. On average, participants were paid an hourly wage of 9. GBP, which falls in Prolifics recommended range at the time of the study. Filters were set to allow participants who are fluent in English and who have Prolific approval rate of 100%, having participated in at least 5 studies. Of the accepted participants, 50 were female and 50 male. The age range was 18 to 73, with an average age of 32 years (SD=13). The respondents lived in the UK (30 participants), the USA (26), South Africa (17), Poland (8), Spain (4), Canada (3), and 12 other countries with two or fewer participants. Of these, 67 were white, 21 Black/African/Caribbean, 8 Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, any other Asian background), 2 mixed (two or more ethnic groups), 1 other (Arab or other), and 1 preferred not to say. Out of the 100 participants, 4 had programmed robot before, 21 studied computer science, robotics, or engineering, and 33 reported having interacted with robot. The participant statistics are visualized in Figure 1. Ethical clearance was obtained by the Kings College ethics committee (MRSP-24/25-50343). 3.4 Methods for Data Analysis Category Coding (RQ1). We coded all questions into categories in order to give structure to the dataset and make it into an actionable resource for future robotic system design. The creation of new coding scheme was necessary 1https://www.figure.ai/ 2https://www.astribot.com/en 3https://hello-robot.com/ 4https://www.1x.tech/ 6 Wachowiak et al.

Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics 7 Fig. 1. Participant Statistics: their experience with robots (Likert scale 17), personal/societal-level attitudes towards robots (measured via GAToRS [27], an average of multiple items using 17 Likert scale), age, gender, ethnicity, and binary statistics on whether they programmed robot before, interacted with one, or studied computer science or engineering. as previous categorizations [34, 40] did not reflect the richness of questions we encountered in the context of users communicating with robots conducting household tasks. Moreover, manual annotation was necessary to ensure high quality, as automated methods, such as clustering, are difficult to interpret and struggle to capture fine-grained differences in user intent. Instead, the questions were coded by the first author of this paper in an inductive, bottom-up manner. No pre-defined (top-down) codes were used. We iteratively annotated the dataset of questions, initially with descriptive terms close to the content. We then iteratively merged related codes into higher-level themes. The final codes are structured in two-level hierarchy. After annotating all questions and defining all categories, the main annotator did second pass over all questions to guarantee that the annotations agree with the final category definitions. To ensure understandability and reproducibility of the codes, we provide codebook with definitions and examples of each code in Tables 24. Moreover, second person re-annotated 100 sentences, which were randomly sampled and balanced across categories, i.e., contained 8 samples per category. Comparing the two annotations, we find that the two annotators agreed on 79% of the questions. Computing Cohens Kappa, chance-corrected coefficient of agreement, we obtain value of .77 (CI = [.68, .86], 𝑝 < .0001). This value corresponds to substantial agreement according to Landis et al. [28]. With three occurrences, the most common disagreement was between self/task-assessment and execution-details. Resultingly, we improved the definitions in the codebook to make the differences clearer. Other disagreements can be traced back to differences in the interpretation of the question. For example, Are you able to tell me if were low on forks and If it can remember where it placed each item? can be interpreted as the user asking for whether the robot has the ability. However, it can also be interpreted as way of asking for the availability of forks and the item locations. Such disagreements can only be resolved by asking the participant who provided the question. Future extensions of this dataset could benefit from participants providing example answers they would deem satisfying in order for the annotators to better understand their expectations. 8 Wachowiak et al. Statistical Analysis Question Importance Ranking (RQ2). To analyze the differences in assigned importance of the different question categories, we use linear mixed-effects model [30]. It is suited to our data set, where individual data points are non-independent, as multiple questions (of the same or different question categories) are rated by the same participant (within-participant). Simply averaging each participants ratings would mean loss of valuable information, which is why we use linear mixed-effects models. Therefore, we model the participant identifier as well as the stimulus identifier as random effects in our mixed-effects model. We use random intercepts model, meaning the observations per participant/stimulus are moved by dedicated intercept. The fixed effect is the question category. The outcome variable is the importance score. linear mixed-effects model, as described, can be written down as: 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑦 + (1𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑡) + (1𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠) The model thus accounts for within-participant and within-stimulus correlation, which in turn provides us with valid standard errors. The model was fit by restricted maximum likelihood. We correct for multiple comparisons via the HolmBonferroni correction [20]. This ensures the family-wise error rate, i.e., the probability of making one or more false discoveries, stays below 𝛼 < .05. Statistical Analysis Influence of Attitudes towards Robots and Robotics Experience on Question Importance (RQ3). Different types of users (e.g., based on cognitive styles or socio-cultural backgrounds [25, 26]) might have varying explanation needs and preferences; changing task circumstances can further complicate explanation needs [52, 53]. For instance, explanations have been found to be more effective at repairing trust when persons attitude towards robots is more positive [12]. The researchers explain this phenomenon by stating that explanations can offer rational or justification for users positive attitudes, thus reducing the users potential for experiencing cognitive dissonance after being confronted with robot error. In our dataset, we measure the importance score people assign to the questions they pose. Given the findings in previous research, we decided to explore whether person with more positive attitudes towards robot, as measured by the GAToRS questionnaire [27], also thinks it is more important for robot to be able to answer their questions. Generally, people who see robots more positively might also expect more communicative capabilities from robots (to not fall into state of dissonance with their positive pre-conceptions), as well as simply show greater interest in their communicative capabilities. On the other hand, users with more negative attitudes might especially be interested in explanation capabilities as tool to build trust. Moreover, we wanted to see if the question importance scores are influenced by users experience with robots. For this analysis, we compute correlations between different user-related variables. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient 𝜌 [44] measures the monotonic relationship between variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, with positive/negative value indicating that the variables tend to increase/decrease together. Again, we correct for multiple testing via the HolmBonferroni correction [20]. Lastly, we run multiple linear regression [36] to gain further insight into how user characteristics are related to how much importance they place on the robots ability to answer their questions. To do so, we use attitudes (societal/personal-level), robotics experience as the predictor variable, and question importance as the outcome variable. Given that the attitude scores are averages of multiple Likert scale items, we can treat them as continuous variables. While the robot experience variable represents scores on 15 scale, it is accepted practice to use such scores as numeric variable in statistical models like linear regression [39]. Statistical models and tests are run via the Python libraries SciPy [49] and statsmodels [41]. What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics 4 Results Dataset of Questions for Robot The results of the study, including participant answers and analysis code, are made available as public dataset5. Overall, we collected 2,052 questions. From these, we excluded 143. Most of the excluded questions were commands in the form of question, for example, Could you clean the fridge?. The remaining excluded questions are hard-tointerpret phrases with missing words or unclear meaning, as well as very rare cases of users writing non-serious joke questions. On average, each participant provided 18.93 (SD=2.82) questions to the dataset. The average question length is 9.73 words (SD=4.16). The questions asked in the dataset show linguistic diversity. Most users speak to the robot directly (67%), for example, What kind of ingredients did you put in the salad?. In contrast, other users refer to the robot (or sometimes the environment) in third-person (30%), for example, Why did it flip the waffle at the end?. In rare cases (2%), the questions are asked from 1st person perspective, for example, What items do we have to make meal?. Some of the questions can only be made sense of in the concrete context of the text or video scenario. For example, What about the bathroom floors? only makes sense in the context of the robot having reported mopping the kitchen floor. In terms of extracted tense, most questions are written in the past (50%) or present (48%), and small subset in future tense (2%). However, the (auxiliary) verb tense does not necessarily need to indicate the future for the question to be about potential future actions, as in Are you considering adding any other ingredients other than the ones on the table?. 4.1 Question Categories Our dataset shows high variety of questions and themes. Figure 2 gives an overview of which categories and subcategories are the most prevalent. Tables 2, 3, and 4 provide the definitions of the main categories as well as each of their three most common subcategories. While some question (sub)categories are very prevalent, for example, questions of the form can you do <x>, there is long tail of rare question categories. This variety of questions and the long tail of rare question types show how difficult it is to develop question-answering components in robotics that can reliably work in all situations. Execution Details. The most common in the dataset are questions in the category execution-details, which deal with the specifics of what happened during the robots task execution. These are often what-questions, querying, for instance, what the robot did, what objects it used, or what goal it was trying to achieve. Environment State. similar category in the sense that it mostly deals with simple facts is the environment-state category. In contrast to the execution-details category, these questions are not about what the robot did but are about the state of the external environment, e.g., Are there any foods that have expired?. Abilities. The second largest category is questions that ask the robot about its capabilities. These questions ask about specific additional abilities, modified versions of what the robot already did, or all the abilities the robot has in specific area. Less commonly, users also asked about the limits of robots abilities, for instance, what would be too heavy or too far away. Time. Beyond the question of whether robot can achieve task, people were also interested in how long the robot needs to execute task. In addition, this category includes questions about when something happened or will happen. 5https://github.com/lwachowiak/xai-questions-dataset 10 Wachowiak et al.

For each main category, the three most frequent subcategories are defined. The less frequent subcategories are summarized under other. There is also small set of questions about the frequency of robot actions, as well as how many tasks the robot can achieve in fixed amount of time. Self/Task-Assessment. In this category, people ask the robot to assess how the task went, for example, if there were any problems, if the robot was successful, or if the task was difficult. Why. Participants also provided many why-questions, category of questions studied in detail throughout the XAI literature. Questions in this category ask the robot to give reasons for its actions. These questions are usually action-focused. Sometimes, participants provide an explicit contrast, so the robot has to answer why it chose one course of action over another. An example of contrastive why-question is Why did you decide to pick an orange and not any other fruit?. Such an explicit contrast is given in 28% of the why-questions. However, even in the case of questions without explicit contrast, people would expect contrastive explanations according to XAI literature [35]. For instance, when asked Why did you choose the orange?, the robot could automatically infer the contrast by identifying what other fruits were on the table as alternatives. Furthermore, why-questions are asked for varying reasons. For instance, in the question Why did you put the tools away in the places that you did so next time can find them?, the participant explicitly mentions that causal explanation would help them to better predict the robots actions in the future. How Did You Decide. With questions of this category, users ask the robot about how it made decision. Similar to the questions in the why category, questions here may be answered by referring to causes and alternatives. However, depending on the user intent, answers not referring to causes are also possible. Specifically, how did you decide... can be interpreted as placing more emphasis on the underlying decision-making procedure (corresponding to Marrs What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics algorithmic level [33]) rather than on the causes. For instance, the question How did you decide how much water to use on the plants? could be answered by saying measured the soil moisture and compared it to the recommended target, thus emphasizing the algorithm employed. Common subcategories concern the decision-making process behind the details of the goal, such as which objects to involve or goal-properties like where to place something. How Did You Know. While similar to the previous two categories of whyand how-did-you-decide-questions, this category once again slightly shifts the focus. Focusing less on the decision-making process, this category emphasizes the robots knowledge and where this knowledge comes from. Examples of knowledge sources can be the robots perception, learning, or prior information. Common subcategories are concerned with properties of the goal and the environment, with questions such as How did the robot know the right time to feed the cat? (goal property) or How do you know if an item is dishwasher friendly? (object property). Future Actions. This category of questions deals with what the robot plans to do next. The most common subcategories include questions on the robots next actions, whether it needs assistance, and what needs to be done. Mental State. This category of questions targets the robots mentalistic concepts. The largest subcategory contains questions that probe the robots understanding and beliefs, e.g. What tasks do you believe are part of cleaning the room?. The second largest subcategory contains questions that ask about the robots emotions, such as whether it found the task enjoyable, boring, or frustrating. Questions from other subcategories include asking the robot about its opinions, ideas, preferences, or desires. However, whether robot should ascribe some of these mental concepts to itself in answers is controversial topic. For instance, in survey by the UK AI Security institute, 61% of participants thought that it is wrong for chatbot to express emotions, while only 19% thought it was acceptable [48]. With mental concepts such as preferences and beliefs, the same participants were more undecided; however, they still leaned towards it being unacceptable. Technical State. Questions in this category are concerned with mechanistic explanations of how the robot functions, e.g., what algorithms or models it uses or how its visual perception works. Questions in this category also touch upon the robots settings, how to change them, and who can control the robot. Lastly, the category contains questions about the robots hardware and battery functionality. 4.2 Question Importance Scores As explained in Section 3.4, we modeled the question importance via linear mixed-effects model. The question category (e.g., why-questions) is the fixed effect, while the participant ID and the stimulus ID were modeled as random intercepts. Resultingly, we find the participant-level standard deviation (0.58) to exceed the stimulus-level standard deviation (0.26), indicating greater heterogeneity across participants than across stimuli. This means that participants random intercept, which models their baseline importance, typically varies across individuals by 0.58 points on the 15 scale. Figure 3 illustrates the resulting estimated marginal means (EMMs) per category, as well as the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After accounting for participantand stimulus-level variability, we find the category of questions about potential issues to be rated most important (EMM = 4.01, 95% CI = [3.82, 4.20], = 118). These are questions about what the robot would do when facing (difficult) variation of the task, and how it can ensure it acts correctly and avoids issues. Questions rated the least important are in the why-questions (3.58, [3.42, 3.75], = 190) and mental-state questions (3.53, [3.35, 3.72], = 120) categories. We find multiple statistically significant differences between the importance ratings of the categories. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we find 𝑝 < .001 with: Wachowiak et al. Fig. 2.

Correlations with Question Importance Scores. We find that users question importance rating has statistically significant correlations with users personal-level (𝜌 = .33, 𝑝 = .0037) and societal-level (𝜌 = .32, 𝑝 = 0.0047) attitudes towards robots. Users robotics experience is less strongly correlated (𝜌 = .19, 𝑝 = .154) and not statistically significant. full correlation heatmap is visualized in Figure 4a. Linear Regression for Predicting the Importance Score. We examined whether users averaged question importance ratings could be predicted from their attitudes towards robots (personal/societal-level), and robot experience. The Wachowiak et al.

Fig. 5. Difference in question type distribution based on robot experience. Robot experience is based on self-report on Likert scale 17. There are 76 participants with score between 1 and 3, and 24 participants with score between 4 and 7. multiple linear regression model was statistically significant overall, 𝐹 (3, 96) = 5.26, 𝑝 = .002, explaining 14.1% of the variance in the importance score. The resulting linear regression equation is: 𝐴𝑣𝑔. 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 = 2.62 + 0.14(𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙-𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑠) + 0.06(𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙-𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑠) + 0.05(𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 𝐸𝑥𝑝.) The linear regression shows personal-level attitudes towards robots to be the strongest predictor with coefficient of 0.14 (𝐶𝐼 = [0.014, 0.272]), indicating that the predicted importance rating increased by 0.14 points with every point What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics 17 increase in the personal-level attitudes scale. Societal attitudes are less important than in the correlation analysis, likely due to the high correlation between the two attitude scales (𝜌 = 0.59, 𝑝 < .001). Coefficients and CIs are visualized in Figure 4b. Differences in Question Categories. Figure 5 shows how users with different levels of robot experience ask different types of questions. To create the graph, participants contributions to each category were normalized, so participants contributions across all categories add up to one. This normalization was necessary as some participants contributed slightly more questions than others. Participants with low robot experience score (13, = 76) asked execution-details questions 23.3% of the time. In contrast, participants with high robot experience score (47, = 24) asked executiondetails questions only 15.7% of the time (difference = -7.6%). similar contrast exists with environment-state questions, which were asked 9.8% of the time by participants with low robot experience and 3.1% by participants with high robot experience (-6.7%). On the other hand, participants with high robot experience asked more questions, for example, in the categories potential-issues (+4.6%), how-did-youdecide (+3.5%), mental-state (+3.1%), and what-abilities (+2.9%). 5 Discussion and Conclusion In this paper, we presented dataset of 1,893 user questions that can help robot practitioners understand user needs when designing natural language interfaces. Below, we discuss the three main findings of (i) what question categories arise, (ii) what their relative importance is, and (iii) how the question types and importance scores of different user groups vary. 5.1 Question Categories We classified our data into 12 categories and 70 subcategories. This helps us understand what type of questions to expect from users. Knowing these categories also helps with understanding what type of data the robot needs to be able to access and collect during task execution. For instance, to answer questions about the environmental state, such data needs to be recorded during task execution. Beyond scanning the environment, this could even include reserving additional actions for exploration, such as checking on the location of objects. To answer questions about its capabilities, the robot needs access to hard-coded capability list or predictive model that allows it to predict what tasks it can achieve. To answer questions about its task performance, the robot needs to understand the users expectations and have reference points for its usual performance. In such manner, each category requires its own considerations of what data the robot needs to collect and have access to in order to answer the questions successfully. Regarding the question categories, we noticed that the types of questions elicited by the text and video scenarios differ. Execution details questions were much more prevalent in the text-based scenarios (36% of all questions) than in the videos (16% of all questions). This is because the text descriptions provide only high-level overview of the robots activities, whereas video scenarios already show the details of an execution. These two different modalities through which users can be informed about robot behavior offer another interesting and novel aspect to our dataset. The two modalities can serve as starting point for future investigations and inform XAI-component developers with respect to their envisioned use case (e.g., asking robots questions on-the-fly during collaborations or supervisor returning to robot having completed set of tasks). 18 Wachowiak et al. 5.2 Question Importance Scores For each question, we also asked the participants how important it is for robot to be able to answer that question. Through pairwise contrasts between the estimated marginal means from linear mixed-effects model, we found various statistical differences in importance scores between question categories. No category scores below 3.5 points on the 15 importance score Likert scale. However, some categories were ranked clearly higher than others. For example, the most important categories dealt with potential issues the robot might run into and how it would handle them. Another important category was questions through which users tried to understand how robot knows things, such as what to do or what an objects properties are. In contrast, why-questions and questions about the robots mental state (e.g., beliefs, desires) ranked lowly. When designing XAI components and natural language interfaces for robots, these findings can help with what question-answering capabilities to prioritize. 5.3 Differences between Participant Groups In the last part of our exploratory data analysis, we found that participants personal and societal-level attitudes towards robots correlated with the average importance score they gave to their questions. This correlation suggests that individuals with higher attitudes towards robots also consider it more important for robot to be able to answer their questions. possible explanation for this is that people with higher attitudes towards robots also have higher expectations regarding what robot is capable of. When exploring whether robot novices ask different questions than participants more experienced with robots, we find that novices tend to ask more questions in the categories execution-details and environment-state, which are both categories concerned with simple facts about what happened and the current state of things. This finding highlights the importance of considering ones users when designing question-answering module, as different users will ask different questions. 5.4 Limitations and Future Work Ambiguous User Intent. As mentioned in Section 3.4, interpreting some questions was occasionally challenging, and assigning them to single category was not always straightforward. Sometimes, the annotator had to infer what the participant intended with their question. For example, the question Are you not afraid the plate will fall from the kitchen counter if you place it on the edge like that? could be an inquiry into the robots assessment of the situation or be intended for the robot to correct its behavior. To remove this uncertainty, future extensions of this dataset could also ask the user to provide an example answer for their question, which they would deem as satisfying. Ecological Validity. Another limitation of our paper is the lower ecological validity of using video and text stimuli compared to putting users into real-world humanrobot interactions. However, video and text stimuli also offer crucial advantages. They allow for highly controlled conditions and reproducible setup. Moreover, they allow us to test user reactions to very diverse set of scenarios, showcasing different types of robots, environments, and tasks. Lastly, data collection is much more scalable than what would be possible in the lab. Therefore, real-world studies would not replace our approach but represent an exciting avenue for complementary future research. Novelty Effect. While participants see multiple stimuli depicting robots executing tasks, they only see the execution of specific task by specific robot once. However, it may be the case that users have different questions during the initial interactions (e.g., asking the robot about its abilities) compared to later, repeated interactions (e.g., asking the What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics 19 robot about deviations from its normal behavior). In future work, we would therefore like to study the change in user questions over time when users repeatedly interact with the same robot. Stimuli. In future research, we would like to extend the already rich set of stimuli used to elicit user questions. First, this could include longer videos (e.g., 35 minutes). Second, the dataset would benefit from further videos involving humans who are involved collaboratively in the tasks, as right now, humans are largely relegated to simply observing the robot or receiving an object. However, the video in which the robot feeds cat shows that users have many questions about the interaction between pet and robot indicating that more interactive scenarios involving humans are likely to elicit an even broader and more diverse set of questions. Participant Diversity. While our participant sample was diverse in gender, age, and background, participants mostly came from Western and Anglophone countries due to Prolifics participant pool and our filter for fluency in English. Future research has the opportunity to investigate cultural differences and extend the corpora to include multilingual questions. An example of national differences in XAI research is given by Kopecka [24], who found differences in the type of people who preferred goal vs. belief-based explanations between the UK and South Korea.

The repository contains: the dataset of all natural language questions, their categories, and their importance scores our analysis code the annotations from second annotator for computing the inter-annotator agreement the questionnaire form to ensure the reproducibility of our work Additionally, the dataset is hosted on HuggingFace. Video Stimuli References The frames presented in Table 1 and the corresponding video stimuli are snippets from the YouTube videos linked below. If video contains multiple tasks, we indicate the task used for our video stimulus by providing the relevant timestamp. For our stimuli, we sometimes changed the playback speed and may have removed elements such as teleoperators and text boxes through cropping. To see the exact stimuli used, contact the corresponding author of this paper. [V1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2GqaGyyIA, Gemini Robotics Salad Making 22 Wachowiak et al.
