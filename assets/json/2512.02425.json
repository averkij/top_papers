Introduction With the increasing deployment of video large language models (video LLMs) [1, 3, 16, 37] in real-world applications, such as AI glasses and household robots, these models are now required to process and reason over extremely long videos from several hours to even days [5, 25, 33]. Recent works [4, 12, 13] have introduced memory-based *Equal contribution; Equal advising approaches that build external memories from abstracted video representations. Such methods allow the model to focus on essential information by retrieving small number of relevant memories, thereby reducing the number of input tokens. This is more efficient and effective strategy compared to processing all frames in the video, requiring high computational cost as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Despite their promise, most existing approaches remain highly dependent on textual representations. Typically, each detected event or clip is converted into captions, summaries, or structured text descriptions for downstream retrieval and reasoning [12, 23, 33]. Although Long et al. [13] incorporates visual inputs when building memory, its use of multimodal features is limited to entity recognition and is not fully exploited during inference (Fig. 1(b)). Moreover, existing models [13, 33] typically retrieve fixed number of clips with predetermined durations, such as retrieving three 30-second clips. These rigid architecture designs in video memory agents face the following two major limitations. First, they fail to adaptively leverage visual information from videos in conjunction with textual memory during retrieval and generation. Visual details are essential for many real-world tasks requiring attribute recognition, spatial reasoning, or precise scene understanding, while this knowledge cannot be fully represented in text. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1(c), fixed strategy that always includes both captions and frames during response generation yields suboptimal results since excessive visual context can even distract the model. Therefore, an adaptive mechanism for selecting multimodal memories is essential for retrieving the most informative references for given query, which remains unexplored in previous works. Second, retrieving fixed number of clips limits the models ability to handle queries that require varying temporal scopes. For instance, question like Where did leave my glasses? may require only few seconds of video, whereas What happened in the second half of the soccer match? demands much longer temporal context. Existing approaches retrieve predetermined length of segments for simplicity [12, 13, 33], which inherently over1 Figure 1. Concept Figure. (a) day-long video sampled at 1 fps has frames that exceed the context limits of video LLMs. (b) M3Agent [13] relies on textual representation of video, which can underrepresent visual information. (c) EgoRAG [33] retrieves both captions and the corresponding visual frames, but irrelevant frames may distract model. (d) WorldMM (Ours) constructs multiple memories, incorporating both textual and visual representations, and uses adaptive memory retrieval to effectively leverage multimodal information. looks the diverse temporal scales of real-world events, limiting flexibility. Instead, the retriever should dynamically gather information at multiple temporal scales, combining hour-level summaries with minute-level details as needed. To fill this gap, we present WorldMM, novel memorybased agent that constructs separate textual and visual memories and employs an adaptive retrieval agent to select the optimal memory modality and temporal granularity for each query. The textual memory comprises two components: episodic memory, which stores multiple events across different time scales, and semantic memory, which captures high-level, long-term knowledge such as relationships and habits, organized within knowledge graphs. The visual memory divides long video into short-term segments indexed within retrieval corpus, enabling the model to access visual information when required. The retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory across modalities and timescales, ensuring that the agent retrieves only the information necessary for each query. The proposed multimodal memory selection design therefore prevents the model from being forced to condition on paired yet unnecessary modality memories when retrieving data for given query, minimizing potential distraction during reasoning. In addition, WorldMM is able to retrieve information at varying levels of granularity over the appropriate time range by leveraging multiple graphs operating at different temporal scales, such as seconds, minutes, and hours. When episodic memory is selected for retrieval, the retrieval agent searches each memory to gather potentially relevant information from all temporal levels. The collected candidates are then jointly examined to determine which pieces of information should be used to answer the query. In the end, we dynamically access both shortand long-term video contexts to assemble only the necessary information for reasoning. Furthermore, the model performs retrieval in multiple turns by iteratively selecting memories and queries, thereby expanding the range of possible combinations and allowing adaptive selection of the information for each query. We evaluate WorldMM with five long video questionanswering benchmarks from hourto week-long durations. The proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, including long video LLMs and memoryaugmented models. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-memory, multiscale design. Specifically, episodic memory enables reasoning over events at multiple timescales, visual memory improves performance on objectand action-centered queries, while semantic memory enhances reasoning over long-term contexts. When all the memories are adaptively integrated, the model achieves the best overall results. These results highlight that our multimodal memory system represents promising direction toward robust long video reasoning. 2. Related Work 2.1. Long Video Understanding Existing video LLMs demonstrate strong understanding capabilities for short videos, and recent research has shifted toward reasoning over longer videos. Current proprietary models, such as GPT-5 [16] and Gemini 2.5 [3], have advanced to minuteor hour-level video understanding [2, 5, 12, 25, 34] by utilizing extended context lengths. However, these models still incur high computational costs and uniformly sampling every frame is often suboptimal for questions focused on localized events [17, 24]. To address these challenges, several strategies have been explored. Visual token compression [8, 9, 11, 19, 20, 26, 35] improves efficiency by reducing token counts but often loses fine-grained details, limiting the capture of subtle or sparse events. Key frame selection [22, 30] retains only the most informative frames to reduce redundancy but fails to detect relevant frames when video streams are too long and may miss rare events. More recently, reasoningcentric training and inference [28, 29] have enhanced long2 Figure 2. Overview of WorldMM. (Left) Multimodal Memory Construction: WorldMM builds three complementary memories (episodic, semantic, and visual memory) that capture temporal events, long-term relations, and visual details from video streams.

(Right) Response Generation: The retrieved content and reasoning history are used by response agent to produce grounded response. range temporal grounding through reinforcement learning and adaptive test-time scaling, yet still face scalability limits on ultra-long videos over ten hours. Beyond hour-level videos, emerging benchmarks push video understanding and reasoning toward dayor even week-long continuous recordings [23, 33]. The aforementioned strategies struggle in these settings due to the massive scale of frames and long-term temporal dependencies. This highlights the necessity for more efficient, context-aware, and scalable approaches to handle extremely long videos. 2.2. Memory-based Video LLMs In order to effectively reason over long videos, retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) based methods that retrieve relevant frames or clips instead of sampled frames have been introduced. They typically retrieve query-relevant information using textual and visual cues, and allow the model to focus on crucial clips [10, 14, 31]. Some recent methods extend this approach by constructing graph structures to encode multimodal interactions across frames [18, 21, 32]. However, these models rely on textual representation or simple similarity score between visual and query features, limiting their ability to perform holistic understanding and complex reasoning over long video sequences. Beyond naive retrieval-based design, memory-based methods have emerged to construct structured knowledge over video streams. EgoRAG [33] organizes hierarchical textual memories that store events from egocentric video streams in hierarchical manner, allowing reasoning throughout day-long activities. Ego-R1 [23] extends this by leveraging vision-centric tools with iterative reasoning to perform long-horizon reasoning. HippoMM [12] proposes dual-process memory using semantic summaries with multimodal cues. M3-Agent [13] constructs entity-centric long-term memory by processing multimodal contexts and adopts iterative reasoning to retrieve relevant knowledge from the memory. Despite these advances, existing works still struggle to fully integrate multimodal information and to dynamically retrieve knowledge across varying temporal scales to handle complex, long video scenarios. 3. WorldMM We introduce WorldMM, novel framework that leverages both textual and visual contexts of video streams to build multimodal memory for comprehensive understanding and reasoning over long videos. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the model operates in three stages: multimodal memory construction, adaptive memory retrieval, and response generation. Given long video stream, WorldMM first builds multiple memories, including two textual memories and one visual memory (Sec. 3.1). Next, retrieval agent iteratively collects query-relevant information from different memories and timescales until sufficient knowledge is gathered to answer the question (Sec. 3.2). Finally, the query is fed into response agent along with the retrieved contents and retrieval history to generate response (Sec. 3.3). 3.1. Multimodal Memory Construction As we described in Sec. 1, an effective memory agent for long-form video understanding must address two key requirements: 1) adaptively leveraging visual information alongside text memory, and 2) retrieving knowledge across diverse temporal ranges. To achieve this, WorldMM constructs three types of memory, each encoding complementary video knowledge across diverse modalities. Episodic memory captures diverse events over multiple dynamic timescales, semantic memory incrementally updates highlevel relational knowledge, and visual memory preserves spatial and appearance details. Together, they form comprehensive multimodal memory that supports episodic retrieval, semantic reasoning, and visually grounded understanding of long-form videos. 3 Episodic Memory Construction Episodic memory consists of multiple textual graphs, each of which encodes events at different temporal resolutions. Before constructing the graphs, we first perform fine-grained captioning on the unit temporal scale t0. We divide the video into short segments of length t0, each converted into caption using video LLM. Most existing approaches rely on fixed temporal scale during memory construction [13, 33], overlooking the diverse spans of real-world events. In contrast, we introduce multi-scale memory composed of multiple temporal resolutions that flexibly encodes information with different levels of density: = {t0, t1, . . . , tN }, t0 < t1 < < tN . (1) For each temporal scale ti , the video is partitioned into non-overlapping segments of length ti. The segments are captioned and transformed into factual triplets (entityaction-entity) to construct knowledge graph (KG) Gti. Finally, episodic memory is represented as set of KGs: Me = {Gt0, Gt1, . . . , GtN }. (2) This multi-scale episodic memory enables temporally grounded reasoning that spans both fine-grained event details and long-range narrative understanding. Semantic Memory Construction Semantic memory captures long-term, evolving knowledge about relationships and habits within video. Since episodic graphs are constructed from independent events, they fail to preserve continuity across distant scenes and cannot capture high-level knowledge. Semantic memory, on the contrary, maintains an evolving graph that continuously integrates relational and habitual knowledge over time. To build this continually updating memory, we first split the input video into coarse segments with fixed timescale ts. Textual captions are generated for each segment and converted into semantic triplets ts, focusing on conceptual knowledge rather than event-specific details. These triplets are incrementally integrated into an evolving semantic graph through consolidation process that merges new knowledge while preserving stable relationships. Specifically, embedding-based similarity is first used to identify overlapping or conflicting triplets between the current graph Gk . The matched triplets are then provided to an LLM along with the new triplets, which determines outdated or conflicting triplets Tremove and triplets that should be revised or added Tupdate. Formally, the consolidation process can be represented as: ) = (cid:0)Gk ts ts and the newly extracted triplets k+ Consolidate(Gk ts (cid:1) Tupdate. , k+1 ts Tremove (3) ts Visual Memory Construction Visual memory captures rich visual details that text cannot fully convey, including detailed object appearances, scene dynamics, and precise spatial context. WorldMM explicitly constructs visual memory to ground reasoning in visual evidence. We consider two scenarios in which visual memory is invoked, when the retrieval agent searches for scenes associated with specific keyword, and when the agent has timestamps identified during preceding retrieval steps to inspect the corresponding frames. Therefore, we adopt two complementary strategies for building visual memory: feature-based retrieval via natural language query, and timestamp-based retrieval for precise temporal grounding. Specifically, we partition each video into short, fixedlength segments of duration tv, encoding each segment tv into visual feature using multimodal encoder, forming feature-based visual memory as set of embeddings: Mf = {f 1 , 2 , . . . , v }. (4) In parallel, to support timestamp-based retrieval, each frame is paired with its corresponding timestamp: MI = {(ti, Ii) Ii = (ti), ti [0, len(V )]}. (5) This allows direct access to visual evidence at specific moments in the video. Finally, the complete visual memory integrates both components Mv = Mf by combining feature-level embeddings and frame-level indices. MI 3.2. Adaptive Memory Retrieval In this section, we present how WorldMM dynamically retrieves the most relevant multimodal memories from the appropriate temporal scope for given query. Retrieval Agent Reasoning over long-form videos requires integrating heterogeneous information from multiple memory sources. To handle this, the retrieval agent iteratively decides which memory to access and what query to issue, conditioned on the user question and retrieval history. Leveraging the distinct characteristics of each memory component, it adaptively selects the most relevant source and formulates modality-specific queries. Through successive iterations, the agent progressively refines its retrieval strategy and constructs better knowledge collection. Formally, we define the retrieval agent as multimodal reasoning module that iteratively selects memory source and formulates corresponding query. At each iteration i, takes an input the user query and the set of previous retrieval histories r<i = {r1, . . . , ri1}, and outputs either memoryquery pair or STOP signal: The resulting semantic memory is continuously evolving KG Ms = GM ts , where denotes the final segment index, capturing the videos long-term knowledge. (cid:40) R(q, r<i) = (mi, qi) STOP if r<i insufficient and N, otherwise, (6) 4 where mi {Me, Ms, Mv} and denotes the maximum number of iterations. If the retriever outputs memoryquery pair (mi, qi), it retrieves the relevant information from the memory mi with search query qi and proceeds to the next iteration with the updated context ri. When the retriever outputs STOP, it indicates that sufficient information has been collected. The iterative process then terminates, and all retrieved results {r1, . . . , rn} are passed to the response agent for the final response generation. Episodic Memory Retrieval Episodic memory retrieval is guided by query provided by the retriever, which specifies the desired information from episodic memory. The main challenge lies in determining the appropriate temporal scope, as episodic memory contains multiple graphs covering different temporal ranges. WorldMM adopts coarseto-fine, multi-timescale retrieval strategy. Specifically, for each temporal graph Gti, the model first retrieves top-k candidate captions using graph-based retrieval framework guided by the Personalized PageRank (PPR) score and the query, following Gutierrez et al. [7]. Subsequently, an LLM serves as cross-scale reranker, jointly analyzing the query and retrieved candidates across all timescales. It then selects the most relevant temporal range and refines the retrieved content, producing the final top-m captions as output. By retrieving from multi-scale memory, the model leverages both coarse temporal context and fine-grained details. Semantic Memory Retrieval The semantic memory, also represented as graph, is queried using PPR-based retrieval algorithm. In contrast to episodic memory retrieval which operates over nodes and their temporal structures, semantic retrieval focuses on relational knowledge encoded as edges between entities. Since the standard PPR score measures node-level relevance, we adapt it for edge-based reasoning by assigning each edge score equal to the sum of the PPR values of its two connected nodes. The top-k triplets corresponding to the highest-scoring edges are then selected as the final retrieved results. Visual Memory Retrieval Following Sec. 3.1, visual memory retrieval operates in two complementary modes: feature-based search and timestamp-based access. In feature-based mode, the retrieval agent formulates query q, encodes it into text feature ft using multimodal encoder, and retrieves the top-k relevant video segments from Mf based on the cosine similarity between ft and the visual features. In timestamp-based mode, when specific temporal ranges are identified, typically following episodic retrieval, the corresponding frames are directly fetched from MI v. By combining these two modes, WorldMM enables flexible and effective access to visual information at both semantic and temporal levels. 3.3. Response Generation Finally, once the retrieval agent determines that sufficient information has been gathered, the retrieval process is terminated. The retrieval history, including the selected memories, their corresponding queries, and the retrieved results, is then passed to the response agent along with the original user query. The response agent generates the final answer by grounding its response in the retrieved information. This clear separation between the retriever and the responder allows each component to focus on its respective objective, ensuring effective retrieval and response generation. 4. Experiment Results 4.1. Experimental Setup Datasets and Metrics We assess the performance of WorldMM across five benchmarks that require reasoning over long videos. EgoLifeQA [33] and Ego-R1 Bench [23] contain week-long videos, and HippoVlog [12] features vlog-style content, requiring comprehension of audio and visual streams. We also assess general video understanding on LVBench [25] and Video-MME (long) [5] with hourlevel videos. All benchmarks consist of multiple-choice questions, with accuracy used as the evaluation metric. Please see additional dataset details in the Sec. A. Baselines We compare WorldMM against comprehensive set of baselines spanning base video LLMs, long video understanding models, RAG systems, and memory-based models. Base video LLMs include GPT-5 [16], Gemini 2.5 Pro [3], and Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct [1], while long video understanding models include VideoChat-Flash [11], TimeR1 [28], and Video-RTS [29], which all use uniformly sampled frames within their input capacity. We further evaluate RAG approaches, including text retrieval methods like LightRAG [6] and HippoRAG [7], which retrieve video captions, and Video-RAG [14], which retrieves relevant clips. Finally, we compare with memory-based frameworks for long video reasoning, including EgoRAG [33], EgoR1 [23], HippoMM [12], and M3-Agent [13]. Implementations Details We adopt VLM2Vec-V2 [15] as multimodal encoder for visual memory retrieval. During the memory construction, GPT-5-mini is used for building episodic and semantic memories. We experiment ours with two video LLMs, GPT-5 and Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct, which serve as the retrieval and response agent, respectively denoted as WorldMM-GPT and WorldMM-8B. For temporal segmentation in episodic memory, we apply timescales specific to each dataset. For example, we use 30-second, 3-minute, 10-minute, and 1-hour intervals for EgoLifeQA. Configurations for other benchmarks, more experimental details, and the prompts are provided in Sec. B. 5 Table 1.

Tab. 1 presents the evaluation results of the proposed WorldMM and baseline models. WorldMM significantly outperforms all baselines across various long video understanding benchmarks. In particular, WorldMM-GPT achieves an average score of 69.5%, exceeding the strongest baseline by 8.4%. Compared with base models, both variants of our model surpass their corresponding baselines by more than 8% on average, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in leveraging strong reasoning capabilities without requiring full video processing. On the other hand, models in the long video LLM category show the weakest performance, with all results falling below 50% on EgoLifeQA and Ego-R1 Bench, indicating that these approaches are not effective in days-long videos. Meanwhile, retrievaland memory-based approaches, including ours, achieve scores mostly above 52% on EgoLifeQA and Ego-R1 Bench, suggesting that selective retrieval of relevant segments is more effective for long video understanding than processing full video sequences. Compared with other retrieval-based models such as HippoRAG and HippoMM, which also rely on GPT backbones, our model achieves markedly higher accuracy on average (69.5% vs. 57.0% and 51.8%). These demonstrate that integrating textual and visual memory and adaptively selecting temporal scopes are crucial for effective video reasoning. 4.3. Efficacy of Multimodal Memory To examine the contribution of each memory in our framework, we perform an ablation study that varies the composition of available memories. The evaluation results, summarized in Tab. 2, show consistent improvement in performance as additional memories are incorporated. This 6 Figure 3. Memory type utilization of WorldMM on five distinctive categories in EgoLifeQA. finding confirms that different memories capture complementary forms of knowledge. All following experiments in this section are conducted using WorldMM-GPT. Effect of Episodic Memory To examine the performance differences arising from the retrieved data modality in WorldMM, we evaluate models using only episodic memory (E) and only visual memory (V), and report the results in Tab. 2. Using only episodic memory shows 20% higher performance than using only visual memory on average. This is mostly because textual information can be more readily organized into graph, which enables effective retrieval, while indexing visual frames into structured representation remains challenging. Effect of Visual Memory Visual memory plays particularly important role in categories that demand perceptual understanding, such as object recognition or action interpretation. In Tab. 2, visual memory significantly enhances accuracy in categories like EntityLog and EventRecall of EgoLifeQA and Ego-R1 Bench, as well as Visual and Audio+Visual of HippoVlog. The full configuration (E+S+V) surpasses the non-visual configuration (E+S) by an average margin of 4.2%. This improvement arises because visual information preserves spatial and perceptual details that are difficult to represent in text. As shown in Fig. 4(a), when relying solely on episodic memory, the model fails to capture object details such as the type of baked item, leading to an incorrect response. In contrast, visual memory provides access to corresponding frames that contain complete scene, enabling accurate interpretation of objects and activities. Effect of Semantic Memory Semantic memory proves the most beneficial for categories that require reasoning over long-term dependencies and abstract relationships. This effect is evident in the HabitInsight and RelationMap categories of EgoLifeQA and Ego-R1 Bench. The model equipped with full memory achieves 76.9% accuracy in HabitInsight, representing 23% improvement over the setting without semantic memory (E+V). This substantial gain indicates that semantic memory serves as structured Table 2. Performance of WorldMM across multiple benchmarks using different memory types.

Qualitative results. (a) Episodic memory alone cannot capture detailed visual context. The retrieval agent dynamically retrieves from visual memory, enabling access to fine-grained visual details. (b) To address the limitations of episodic memory in representing relationships or habitual behaviors, the retrieval agent proactively accesses semantic memory, allowing it to incorporate habitual knowledge. knowledge base that captures relational or habitual knowledge accumulated over time. The qualitative example in Fig. 4(b) illustrates this behavior, where episodic memory alone fails to infer habitual actions that extend beyond single event. By contrast, semantic memory captures the repeated use of kitchen wet wipes, allowing the model to infer the correct answer through long-term reasoning. Adaptive Retrieval on Multimodal Memory To further analyze how categories differ in their reliance on distinct memory modalities in WorldMM, we quantify the usage proportion of each memory across all retrieval iterations per category. As shown in Fig. 3, while episodic memory plays foundational role across all tasks, certain categories tend to select it more frequently than other memory types: HabitInsight and RelationMap depend primarily on semantic memory, reflecting their reliance on reasoning over longterm patterns. In contrast, EntityLog and EventRecall benefit more from visual memory, which provides fine-grained perceptual details not fully captured by text. This selective utilization suggests that the model dynamically emphasizes the most relevant memory type for each category, leveraging the strength of each type in context-dependent manner. These results confirm that different types of memory contribute distinct yet complementary strengths. 4.4. Dynamic Temporal Scope Retrieval We evaluate episodic memory retrieval performance across diverse temporal scales of events using temporal intersection over union (tIoU), which measures the overlap between retrieved and ground truth segments as the ratio of their intersection to their union duration. We compare WorldMM with various models in temporal grounding, single-modality retrieval, long-form egocentric video retrieval, and keyframe selection. Details about baselines are given in Sec. C.1. As shown in Tab. 3, WorldMM significantly superior tIoU scores than strong baselines. Notably, reasoning-based retrieval and keyframe selection methods exhibit lower tIoU values, indicating difficulty in handling long input contexts. Moreover, Fig. 5 demonstrates that the superior tIoU is directly correlated with higher overall accuracy, particularly in understanding long videos. 4.5. Efficacy of Multi-turn Retrieval We validate the effectiveness of our models multi-turn approach by limiting the maximum number of retrieval steps. The results in Fig. 7 show that performance consistently improves as the number of iterations increases across all benchmarks.

Accuracy of WorldMM with different maximum retrieval steps. over single-step retrieval. This gain arises because multiple iterations enable the retrieval agent to gather additional relevant information and refine its retrieval strategy when earlier attempts are suboptimal. An example of this refinement is shown in Sec. E.2, where the model corrects an initially irrelevant retrieval to produce more accurate and contextually grounded response. 4.6. Analysis on Efficiency To assess the efficiency of our framework, we measure the end-to-end latency of WorldMM on 100 randomly sampled queries from EgoLifeQA. As shown in Fig. 6, our method achieves superior latencyaccuracy trade-off compared with baselines. Long-video LLMs incur significantly higher inference latency, while still exhibiting relatively low performance. Although RAGor memory-based approaches offer better latency, they often require substantial preprocessing and show significant performance gap. In contrast, by allowing the retrieval agent to adaptively finish iterations and by retrieving only the relevant segments, WorldMM achieves low latency and substantially higher accuracy. 4.7. Efficacy of Memory Modules To enable effective long video reasoning, WorldMM applies different strategies for each memory. Tab. 4 reports the results of WorldMM-8B under various module configurations with details about each method in Sec. C.2. For episodic memory, using fixed single timescale or embeddings instead of graphs results in 6.1% and 4.4% drop in average accuracy, respectively, highlighting the importance of multi-scale structured knowledge. For semantic memory, removing the consolidation process results in approximately 7% drops for the category that requires long-term reasoning, demonstrating the need for continuous integration of knowledge to support long-term reasoning. Finally, for visual memory, disabling its dual-mode retrieval leads to an accuracy drop of about 3%, indicating that each mode contributes complementary benefits for retrieving particular scenes or accessing broader temporal ranges. 5. Conclusion We propose WorldMM, novel memory agent designed to perceive and remember the world as represented in long video streams. To address the challenges of long video reasoning, we introduce multimodal, multi-scale memory that integrates textual and visual information through adaptive retrieval. By constructing separate memories across different modalities and timescales, together with retrieval agent that iteratively identifies relevant information, our approach enables effective and flexible reasoning over long videos. We validate our model on multiple benchmarks ranging from hourto week-long videos, demonstrating that WorldMM provides promising solution capable of robust performance across various long video reasoning tasks."

EgoLifeQA EgoLifeQA [33] is set of questions designed to test the capability of models to understand and remember everyday life from week-long video recordings. It includes questions that require recalling past events, tracking object locations, and reasoning over long-term activities. In our experiments, we use questions from the perspective of single participant (A1: JAKE), along with his corresponding video stream, which spans 44.3 hours. The benchmark is organized into five distinct categories as follows. EntityLog (Ent.) Questions that require recalling information about objects, such as their locations, states, or interactions. (Example: Who used the screwdriver first?) EventRecall (EvR.) Questions that ask about specific past events, including what happened, when it occurred, and (Example: Shure mentioned Tiramisu, relevant context. when was the last time we discussed making Tiramisu?) HabitInsight (Hab.) Questions aimed at identifying persons recurring behaviors or long-term activity patterns. (Example: What food does Alice love to eat?) RelationMap (Rel.) Questions involving understanding social relationships and interactions between people. (Example: Who usually sings when Shure plays the guitar?) TaskMaster (Task) Questions focused on ongoing or pending tasks that require reasoning about what actions still need to be completed. (Example: What are we planning to do in the afternoon?) Ego-R1 Bench [23] is designed as complementary evaluation to EgoLifeQA, but with distinct focus on model reasoning. While both benchmarks focus on the same week-long egocentric video, Ego-R1 Bench targets multistep, tool-augmented reasoning over ultra-long video. We reorganize query types of Ego-R1 Bench to the category adopted by EgoLifeQA, as shown in Tab. 6. Table 6. Classification of queries under the EgoLifeQA category. Category Ego-R1 Category EntityLog, FoodLog, HealthLog, TechLog EventRecall, Event Recollection, Event Memory EntityLog EventRecall HabitInsight HabitInsight, Behavior Habit(s) RelationMap RelationMap, Interpersonal Relationships TaskMaster, Future Plan(s) TaskMaster A.3. HippoVlog HippoVlog [12] contains 25 daily vlog videos with 1,000 multiple-choice questions for continuous audiovisual event understanding. The benchmark evaluates models ability to handle modality-specific information, with Auditory (Aud.) questions requiring reasoning over the audio stream (or transcript) and Visual (Vis.) questions focusing on the visual content. Auditory+Visual (A+V) queries test the models ability to integrate information across both modalities, while Summarization (Summ.) questions assess higher-level reasoning over long temporal spans, requiring synthesis of events and semantic understanding from the continuous video. A.4. LVBench LVBench [25] consists of 103 long videos, typically longer than an hour, with 1,549 multiple-choice questions for extreme long video understanding. The videos cover general and diverse set of domains. Questions include both visual perception for recognizing entities or events in short segments and summarization for higher-level reasoning across extended sequences, evaluating models ability to integrate information over both local and long-horizon contexts. In our experiments, we categorize questions into three groups based on their segment length, defined as the duration of video required to answer the question: Short (<30s), (30s5min), and Long (>5min). We Medium (Med.) excluded 15 questions without segment tags, leaving 1,534 questions in total for evaluation. 11 A.5. Video-MME Video-MME [5] is comprehensive video understanding benchmark with 2,700 questions and varying video durations. In this experiment, we use only the long subset (>30min), containing 900 questions, to assess the models capability on long video reasoning. We adopt the categories provided by the benchmark, with acronyms as follows: Action Reasoning (ARES), Action Recognition (AREC), Attribute Perception (ATTR), Counting Problem (CNT), Information Synopsis (ISYN), OCR Problems (OCR), Object Reasoning (ORES), Object Recognition (OREC), Spatial Perception (SPER), Spatial Reasoning (SRES), Temporal Perception (TPER), and Temporal Reasoning (TRES). B. Additional Implementation Details We provide additional details on the baseline setup (Sec. B.1), the configuration of our proposed WorldMM (Sec. B.2), and the prompts used (Sec. B.3). by authors and set the maximum number of reasoning iterations to 5 to ensure consistent evaluation across all systems. All other implementation details follow the official specifications provided by the respective authors. B.2. WorldMM To construct multi-scale episodic memory, we tailor the temporal resolutions to each datasets duration. For EgoLifeQA and Ego-R1 Bench, which contain week-long videos, we use four broad timescales: 30 seconds, 3 minutes, 10 minutes, and 1 hour. For HippoVlog, LVBench, and Video-MME, which contain shorter recordings averaging about an hour, we adopt shorter timescales of 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes to better match their temporal structure. For semantic memory, triplets with similarity score above 0.6 are consolidated using an LLM, and the top 10 triplets are retrieved at query time. The retrieval agent is limited to maximum of five iterations, consistent with the baseline evaluation setting. B.1. Baseline Setup B.3. Prompts Base Models & Long Video LLMs For all base models and long video LLMs, the video input is uniformly sampled at 0.5 fps and capped at 768 frames, since we cannot process all frames due to context limit, as mentioned in Sec. 1. For Time-R1 [28], we employ the 7B checkpoint1. RAG-based Video LLMs For text-based RAG video models, we construct knowledge base from video captions. Specifically, each video is segmented into 30 second chunks, and set of captions from these segments serve as retrieval pool. LightRAG [6] performs dual-level retrieval, selecting either fine-grained (low-level) or abstracted (high-level) information from the knowledge graph generated from set of captions depending on the query. HippoRAG [7], in contrast, retrieves raw captions ranked by their PPR scores, treating each caption as separate document. For Video-RAG [14] model, retrieval is performed directly on the raw video using tools such as optical character recognition (OCR) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) to extract textual signals. Unless otherwise stated, we follow the retrieval specifications described in each models corresponding paper or implementation. Memory-based Video LLMs Memory-based video LLMs construct explicit memories from the video stream. For EgoRAG [33] and Ego-R1 [23], which build hierarchical textual memories, we use the same temporal granularity applied when constructing WorldMMs memory. For models that perform iterative reasoning, including Ego-R1 [23] and M3-Agent [13], we evaluate the checkpoints released 1https://huggingface.co/Boshenxx/Time-R1-7B To construct and retrieve memory, and to generate the final response of WorldMM, we employ carefully optimized prompts for use with an LLM. In particular, we use prompts for episodic triple extraction (Figs. 9 and 10) and multiscale memory construction  (Fig. 11)  , adapted from Yang et al. [33]. Furthermore, we utilize prompts for multiscale memory retrieval  (Fig. 12)  , semantic triple extraction  (Fig. 13)  , semantic consolidation  (Fig. 14)  , iterative reasoning by the retrieval agent  (Fig. 15)  , and final response generation  (Fig. 16)  . C. Additional Description on Experiments In this section, we provide additional description of the settings used in our ablation experiments. C.1. Dynamic Temporal Scope Retrieval (Sec. 4.4) To evaluate performance on dynamic temporal reasoning with WorldMM, we employ several approaches, including temporal grounding model, embedding-based retrieval models, hierarchical retrieval models, and keyframe selection method. For each method, we measure tIoU using either the returned timestamps or the timestamps of the selected content. For the temporal grounding model, we use Time-R1 [28], with slightly modified prompt that enables it to return both the evidence timestamps and the corresponding grounded responses. We sample videos at 0.5 fps and provide up to 768 frames. For embedding-based and hierarchical retrieval models, we follow the configurations described in Sec. B.1. Additionally, we include Qwen3 Emb., which applies the Qwen3-Embedding-4B [36] text encoder for caption retrieval, and InternVideo2, which encodes each segment using InternVideo2 [27] as an video en12 coder with uniform 16 frame averaging to enable segmentlevel retrieval. Both methods retrieve 30 second segments based on similarity search. For key frame selection, we apply AKS [22], which selects keyframes from the 0.5 fps sampled sequence. For tIoU evaluation, we interpret frames as representing their corresponding 30 second segments. C.2. Efficacy of Memory Modules (Sec. 4.7) To assess the contribution of each component within WorldMMs multimodal memory system, we evaluate several ablated variants in Sec. 4.7. In this section, we detail each variant of WorldMM created by selectively disabling specific component. For episodic memory variants, we first construct fixed timescale variant by replacing hierarchical episodic memory with single fixed timescale memory. Specifically, we use the episodic memory of the finest granularity timescale. We also experiment an embedding retrieval variant in which the models graph-based episodic retrieval is replaced with an embedding-based similarity search using Qwen-Embedding-4B. To examine the effect of semantic consolidation, we use w/o consolidation version that bypasses the consolidation procedure to update the memory and instead store the raw extracted triplets without any update to existing memory. Finally, for visual memory, we ablate components of dual-retrieval mechanism by evaluating systems that rely exclusively on either feature retrieval through natural-language keyword search or timestamp retrieval based purely on temporal indices. D. Detailed Experimental Results Main results Tabs. 7 and 8 present the category-wise performance breakdown of WorldMM and baseline methods. Beyond overall benchmark averages, WorldMM consistently outperforms existing approaches across most categories. Notably, the gains are especially larger in categories that rely on visual information. For instance, in the EntityRecall category of EgoLifeQA, where visual cues can help answering, WorldMM exceeds the previous best method, Ego-R1, by substantial 11.2%. Similarly, on HippoVlog, our model achieves 4% improvement in the Aud. and A+V categories, both of which require visual reasoning. These margins are greater than those observed in categories that do not explicitly depend on visual content, highlighting the strong advantage of our multimodal multi-memory architecture. Efficacy of multimodal memory Fig. 8 shows memory type utilization of our model on HippoVlog benchmark, where categories are grouped by their modality requirements. The Audio category requires reasoning over spoken content and therefore is expected to depend primarily on textual memory derived from caption transcripts, while the Visual category focuses on visual understanding and correspondingly is designed to rely more on visual memory. Our results clearly support these expectations, showing that the Audio category predominantly activates textual memory while the Visual category relies heavily on visual memory, indicating that each category effectively leverages the required memory. Moreover, the Summarization category, which requires long-term reasoning, utilizes semantic memory more than any other category, demonstrating the complementary roles and effectiveness of each memory module in handling different reasoning demands. Together with this distribution of memory usage and the demonstrated performance gains in Tab. 2, these underscore the effectiveness of our multimodal multi-memory framework. Dynamic temporal scope retrieval Tabs. 9 and 10 detail the per-category tIoU and accuracy results for WorldMM and baseline methods. While WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines on average, the results on LVBench particularly highlight the effectiveness of our dynamic episodic memory. In LVBenchs Long category, where answering requires reasoning over more than five minutes of video, WorldMM outperforms the baselines by notably larger margin than in categories that require shorter timescale, underscoring its ability to flexibly retrieve and integrate information over diverse temporal spans. E. Qualitative Results E.1. Memory Construction Tab. 11 presents an example of episodic triplet extraction. Given caption generated from sampled frames of segment along with its corresponding transcript, an LLM is prompted (using the prompt in Fig. 10) to extract episodic triplets. Semantic triplets are extracted using different prompt  (Fig. 13)  , designed to focus on long-term dependencies and capture more abstract relationships across the segments, as shown in Tab. 12. To better capture persistent knowledge across segments, we introduce semantic consolidation, which incrementally updates the semantic graph by integrating new triplets and resolving conflicts. Using embedding-based matching and an LLM, duplicated or conflicting triplets are removed, and new or revised ones are added, generating an evolving semantic memory, as shown in Tab. 13. For instance, the new triplet [I, uses WeChat for, money transfers] is merged with the existing triplet to consolidate redundant information, and conflicting triplets, such as [Lucia, dislikes, overly sweet food] versus [Lucia, likes, sweet desserts], are removed to ensure consistency in the semantic memory. 13 E.2. Multi-turn Refinement WorldMM demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-turn reasoning by progressively refining its retrieval strategy to answer questions, as shown in Tab. 14. In this example, the first round retrieves episodic memory using narrow keyword focused on the discussion of the air conditioning, but it provides insufficient detail about the activity. In the second round, the model expands to more general keyword, air conditioning, which enables retrieval of every scene where the air conditioning is involved to obtain sufficient textual evidence. Moreover, in the third round, since the textual evidence fails to capture specific visual details of the scene, WorldMM refines its strategy to retrieve video frames corresponding to the relevant timestamp. Through this stepwise process, WorldMM effectively refines its search strategy with different keyword strategies and memory types to respond to the question. F. Limitation and Broader Impact While WorldMM serves as an effective multimodal memory agent for long video reasoning, it still requires careful preprocessing, including video captioning, triplet extraction, and semantic consolidation. Yet, this limitation is not unique to our approach but broader constraint shared by existing memory-based video LLMs. For example, M3Agent [13] incurs even heavier preprocessing due to its reliance on entity recognition, and many other approaches operate with offline preprocessing. In contrast, WorldMM is designed for online operation. Memories are updated at fixed intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds), and the required preprocessing for each segment can be performed within these windows. Moreover, new information can be seamlessly integrated into the knowledge graph, and our consolidation mechanism efficiently refines the knowledge base without requiring the reconstruction of memory from scratch. With strong long-term reasoning capabilities and support for real-time updates, WorldMM serves as practical solution for streaming scenarios such as egocentric assistants and embodied agents. This foundation enables richer and more persistent assistance for everyday tasks and accessibility. However, the continuous accumulation of structured knowledge over periods of time raises serious privacy and security concerns. Real-world deployments must therefore enforce safeguard policies, including strict access controls, secure data handling, and privacy protections. 14 Model Base Models Qwen3-VL-8B [1] Gemini 2.5 Pro [3] GPT-5 [16] Table 7.

Prompt for named entity recognition (NER). Recognized named entities are used to extract episodic triplets as shown in Fig. 10. Your task is to construct an RDF (Resource Description Framework) graph from the given passages and named entity lists. Respond with JSON list of triples, with each triple representing relationship in the RDF graph. Pay attention to the following requirements: Each triple should contain at least one, but preferably two, of the named entities in the list for each passage. When resolving pronouns, if the pronoun refers to the first-person (e.g., I, me, my), keep it as instead of replacing with terms like speaker or narrator. For other pronouns, clearly resolve them to their specific names to maintain clarity. Convert the paragraph into JSON dict, it has named entity list and triple list.

Prompt for episodic triplet extraction. 20 As an Event Summary Documentation Specialist, your role is to systematically structure and summarize event information, ensuring that all key actions of major characters are captured while maintaining clear event logic and completeness. Your focus is on concise and factual summarization rather than detailed transcription. # Specific Requirements 1. Structure the Events Clearly - Merge related events: Consolidate similar content into major events and arrange them in chronological order to ensure smooth logical flow. - Logical segmentation: Events can be grouped based on location, task, or theme. Each event should have clear starting point, progression, and key turning points without any jumps or fragmentation in the information. 2. Retain Key Information - The primary characters (I) decisions and actions must be fully presented, including all critical first-person activities. Transitions between different parts, such as moving between floors or starting/ending task, should be seamless. - Any discussions, decisions, and task execution involving the primary character and other key individuals that impact the main storyline must be reflected. This includes recording, planning, and confirming matters, but in concise manner. - The purpose and method of key actions must be recorded, such as ordering takeout using phone or documenting plan on whiteboard. 3. Concise Expression, Remove Redundancies - Keep the facts clear, avoiding descriptions of atmosphere, emotions, or abstract content. - Remove trivial conversations and extract only the core topics and conclusions of discussions. If discussion is lengthy, summarize it into task arrangements, decision points, and specific execution details. 4. Strictly Adhere to Facts, No Assumptions - Do not make assumptions or add interpretationsstrictly organize content based on available information, ensuring accuracy. Every summarized point must have basis in the original information, with no unnecessary additions. - Maintain the correct chronological order of events. The sequence of developments must strictly follow their actual occurrence without any inconsistencies. # Output Format Each paragraph should represent one major event, structured in summary-detail-summary format. Strictly output below 500 words in total. Do not report the word count in the output. Figure 11. Prompt for episodic memory construction to generate coarser-level caption. 21 You are an expert assistant that helps filter and select relevant video captions based on given query. Your task is to analyze the retrieved video captions and determine which ones are most relevant to answer the question. Given the following question and retrieved video captions, select and rank the most relevant captions that should be used to answer the question. Instructions: 1. Consider the nature of the question when selecting captions: - e.g., for queries about specific events, focus on finer granularities; for habitual, relationship, or general queries, consider coarser granularities. - Note that coarser granularity captions may provide broader context, but finer granularity captions often contain more specific details. 2. Each caption shows its time range (start time to end time) 3. Analyze each caption for relevance to the question 4. Select captions that directly help answer the question 5. Return the IDs in ranked order (most relevant first) 6. Only include captions that are truly relevant Return ONLY JSON array of caption IDs in order of relevance (most relevant first), without additional justification. Figure 12. Prompt for episodic memory retrieval to select from multiple timescales. 22 You are tasked with extracting semantic knowledge from episodic triples. Your goal is to infer generalizable information that extends beyond the specific episode. Focus on capturing valid semantic triples that can guide reasoning about behavior, relationships, or preferences. # What to Extract 1. Relationships: social bonds or roles between entities that persist over time (e.g., Alice is friend with Bob, Jason is teacher of Alice). 2. Attributes & Preferences: tendencies, likes/dislikes, personality-like traits, or behavioral habits (e.g., Alice prefers not having dessert, Bob enjoys music). 3. Habits & Capabilities: actions or patterns that suggest what an entity often does, can do, or tends to do (e.g., Alice often helps friends, Jason can give advice). 4. Conceptual Knowledge: directly useful facts that support reasoning, but avoid overly broad taxonomic statements (e.g., Alices office is near Cafe X, Bobs gym is closed on Sundays). # What to Avoid - One-off events or transient states (e.g., ate pizza yesterday, was late once) unless explicitly declared as preference/role - Broad taxonomy or trivia unrelated to behavior (e.g., laptop is electronics, Paris is in France) - Speculative or mind-reading inferences without textual support (e.g., motives, beliefs not evidenced) # Important Notes - Prefer to base semantic triples on multiple supporting episodes. - BUT if single episode clearly reflects role, preference, habit, or capability, it is valid to include it. - Each semantic triple MUST have at least one supporting episodic triple. - Reduce duplication. If multiple episodic triples support the same or very similar semantic knowledge, merge them into one semantic triple rather than repeating. - The episodic evidence[i] list must always point to the indices that support semantic triples[i]. - Aim for broad coverage: extract as many valid semantic triples as reasonably supported by the input. # Output Format - Return ONLY JSON object with the following two keys: - semantic triples (List[List[str]]): Each item is triple [subject, predicate, object]. - episodic evidence (List[List[int]]) : Each item is list of 0-based indices pointing to the input episodic triples that support the corresponding semantic triple at the same position. - The two lists MUST have the same length and aligned order. - If no semantic knowledge is inferable, return: {semantic triples: [], episodic evidence: []} Example: Episodic triples: 0. [Alice, talks to, Bob], 1. [Alice, laughs with, Bob], 2. [Alice, doesnt eat cake, at restaurant], 3. [Alice, shares personal stories with, Bob], 4. [Alice, brings coffee to, Bob], 5. [Jason, talks to, Alice], 6. [Alice, declines dessert, at friends house] Output: { semantic triples: [ [Alice, is friend with, Bob], [Alice, prefers, not having dessert] ], episodic evidence: [ [0, 1, 3], [2, 6] ] } Figure 13. Prompt for semantic triplet extraction. 23 You are tasked with consolidating semantic knowledge by processing new semantic triple against relevant existing knowledge from previous timestamps. Your job is to make two decisions: 1. Which existing triples to remove/pop those that should be merged with the new triple or conflict with it 2. How to update the new triple to capture merged information or resolve conflicts # Consolidation Rules 1. Merge Similar Information: If existing triples express very similar information to the new triple, remove them and update the new triple to contain the most complete/accurate form. 2. Resolve Conflicts: If the new triple conflicts with existing ones, decide which is more accurate/recent and remove outdated ones. 3. Update with Context: Use information from existing triples to make the new triple more specific or more accurate. 4. Preserve Unique Information: Only remove existing triples when they are redundant or conflicting. # Output Format Return ONLY JSON object with the following two keys: - updated triple (List[str]): The new triple, possibly updated [subject, predicate, object]. - triples to remove (List[int]): Indices of existing triples to remove (empty list if none). Example: New triple: [Alice, enjoys, coffee] Existing triples: 0. [Alice, likes, beverages] 1. [Alice, favors, to have coffee after dinner] 2. [Alice, prefers, hot drinks] 3. [Alice, likes to drink, coffee] Output: { updated triple: [Alice, likes, coffee], triples to remove: [1, 3] } Figure 14. Prompt for semantic memory consolidation. 24 You are reasoning agent for video memory retrieval system. Your job is to decide whether to stop and answer, or to search memory for more evidence. When searching, you must select exactly one memory type and form query. # Decision Modes 1. search: Retrieve memory to begin, continue, or extend progress toward the answer - Choose one memory type and form keyword(phrase)-style search query. 2. answer: Stop searching because the accumulated results are sufficient. - No memory type selection is needed. # Memory Types 1. Episodic: Specific events/actions. Stores memories of past events and actions. Query by EVENT/ACTION. 2. Semantic: Entities/relationships. Stores factual knowledge about entities and their relationships, roles, and habits. Query by ENTITY/CONCEPT. 3. Visual: Scene/setting snapshots. Stores visual snapshots of scenes and settings. Query by SCENE/SETTING or TIMESTAMP RANGE. - For timestamp range queries, return in the format: DAY HH:MM:SS - DAY HH:MM:SS. # Context Inputs - Current Query - Round History: Log of past retrieval rounds. Each round is written in this format: ### Round Decision: <searchanswer> Memory: <episodicsemanticvisual> Search Query: <query text> Retrieved: <retrieved items> # Strict Output Rules - If decision = search: Must include selected memory with exactly one memory type and one query. - If decision = answer: Do NOT include selected memory. - Always output in valid JSON only, no extra commentary. # Output Format { decision: search answer, selected memory: { memory type: episodic semantic visual, search query: <str> } # Omit if decision = answer } (Few-shot examples given) Figure 15. Prompt for retrieval agent to decide retrieval strategy. 25 You are an AI assistant that answers questions about egocentric video experiences using retrieved memory context. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions based on this accumulated context. Always choose the most relevant answer from the given choices based on the evidence provided. # Guidelines - Analyze all provided context carefully. - Choose the answer that best matches the evidence. - If evidence is unclear, make the most reasonable inference. # Output Format Provide your answer as single letter (A, B, C, or D) based on the evidence. Figure 16. Prompt for response agent to generate response based on retrieved results."
