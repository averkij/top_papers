Introduction Recent results in LLM reasoning [43] illustrate the potential to improve reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute. Generally, these approaches train models to produce traces that are longer than the Corresponding author(s): yuxiaoq@andrew.cmu.edu; project website: https://cohenqu.github.io/mrt.github.io/. Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning typical correct solution, and consist of tokens that attempt to implement some algorithm: e.g., reflecting on the previous answer [23, 33], planning [9], or implementing some form of linearized search [14]. These approaches include explicitly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for algorithmic behavior, e.g., SFT on search data [14, 31], or running outcome-reward RL [9] against 0/1 correctness reward. While training models to spend test-time compute by generating long reasoning chains via outcomereward RL has been promising, for continued gains from scaling test-time compute, we ultimately need to answer some critical understanding and method design questions. First, do current LLMs efficiently use test-time compute? That is, do they spend tokens roughly in the ballpark of the typical solution length or do they use too many tokens even on easy questions? Second, would LLMs be able to discover solutions to harder questions when run at much larger test-time token budgets than what was used for training? Ultimately, we would want models to derive enough utility from every token (or any semantically meaningful segment) they produce, not only for efficiency but also because doing so imbues systematic procedure to discover solutions for harder, out-of-distribution problems. In this paper, we formalize the above challenges in optimizing test-time compute through the lens of meta reinforcement learning (RL) [49]. To build our approach, we segment the output stream from an LLM on given problem into multiple episodes (Figure 2). If we were to only care about (a) efficiency, then the LLM should only learn to exploit and directly output the final answer without spending too many episodes. On the other hand, if the LLM is solely focused on (b) discovery, then exploration is more desirable, so that the LLM can spend several episodes trying different approaches, verifying and revising them, before producing the final answer. Fundamentally, this is different from traditional RL since the goal here is to learn an LLM that implements explore-exploit algorithms on every test problem. In other words, we aim to learn such algorithms from training data, making this meta RL learning problem. Figure 2: MRT uses dense rewards based on progress throughout the thinking trace (segmented into episodes) to improve final performance and test-time efficiency. Standard fine-tuning only trains models with outcome rewards at the end, thus reinforcing several traces that make subpar progress but somehow succeed (Figure 1(a)). desired meta behavior is one that strikes balance between committing to an approach prematurely (i.e., an exploitation episode) and trying too many high-risk strategies (i.e., an exploration episode). From meta RL literature, we know that optimally trading off exploration and exploitation is equivalent to minimizing cumulative regret over the output token budget. This regret measures the cumulative difference between the likelihoods of success of the LLM and an oracle comparator, as illustrated by the red shaded area in Figure 1(b). By training an LLM to minimize cumulative regret on every query, we learn strategy that is, in way, agnostic of the test-time budget, i.e., when deployed, the LLM spends only the necessary amount of tokens while still making progress when run at larger token budgets. We develop new class of finetuning methods for optimizing test-time compute to produce such solutions called Meta Reinforcement fine-Tuning (MRT), by minimizing this notion of cumulative regret, which also provides metric for evaluating the efficacy of existing reasoning models such as Deepseek-R1 [9] in using test-time compute. 2 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning In particular, we find that SoTA LLMs fine-tuned with outcome reward RL fail to improve their chances of discovering the right answer with more episodes, i.e., they do not make steady progress (illustration in Figure 1(a)), even though this behavior is critical for discovering solutions on hard unseen problems. In fact, much more naïve approach of running substantially fewer episodes coupled with majority voting is often more effective on the harder questions in FLOPs-matched evaluation (Figure 3). In contrast, we show that optimizing for notion of progress in addition to outcome reward naturally emerges when the objective is to minimize regret. Concretely, our fine-tuning paradigm, MRT, prescribes dense reward bonus for RL training (Definition 6.1). Intuitively, this progress reward measures the change in the likelihood of finishing at correct answer, before and after given episode is generated. Empirically, we evaluate MRT in two settings that differ in the way they parameterize episodes. For the first setting, we employ the format of enclosing the reasoning process in between <think> markers and fine-tune base models: DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview [27], DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and DeepSeekR1-Distill-Qwen-7B [9], on dataset of math reasoning problems. We find that MRT consistently outperforms outcome-reward RL, achieving state-of-the-art results at the 1.5B parameter scale across multiple benchmarks in aggregate (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AMC 2023, etc.), with improvements in accuracy over the base model 2-3x relative to improvements from standard outcome-reward RL (GRPO [41]) over the base model, and token efficiency improvements of 1.5x over GRPO and 5x over the base model. For the second setting, we fine-tune Llama3.1 models to implement backtracking, where MRT achieves token efficiency improvements of 1.6-1.7x over both STaR [57] and GRPO [41]. We analyze MRT and show that it attains lower cumulative regret and makes more steady progress, even when extrapolating to 2x larger token budgets than what it was trained on. We also show that, unlike other methods for constraining length, which typically come at the cost of accuracy, MRT reduces the output length while boosting accuracy. We also find that the output length oscillates during RL and that length alone does not imply accuracy. Finally, we show that recipes for iteratively scaling test-time budgetswhich have been noted to be more effective than training with large output budget from scratchalso implicitly maximize progress and, hence, minimize regret. 2. Related Work Scaling test-time compute. Earlier works [48, 50] scale up test-time compute by training separate verifiers [6, 38] for best-of-N [7] or beam search [4], which can be more optimal than scaling data or model parameters [19, 43]. Building on this, recent works [14, 29] train LLMs to simulate in-context test-time search by fine-tuning on search traces. However, gains from such approaches are limited since fine-tuning on search traces that are unfamiliar to the base model can lead to memorization [20, 23, 37]. To prevent this in our setting, we apply warmstart procedure before running on-policy STaR/RL. Reasoning with long chains of thought (CoT). RL with outcome rewards has shown promise for finetuning LLMs to produce long CoTs that can search [24], plan [52], introspect [33] and correct [9, 22]. More recently, several works have considered adding length penalties to the outcome reward objective to discourage length for easier problems [2] and encourage length for harder problems [53, 56]. However, recent work has shown that length may not have direct correlation with accuracy [26, 27, 58], and that existing long CoT models tend to use too many tokens [5]. In our work, we tie this inefficiency to the inability of outcome-reward RL to learn to output solutions that make steady progress. Similar to our approach, concurrent works also leverage dense rewards. For example, [8], which maximizes the likelihood of generating successful traces given partial solution, and [53], which obtains the exploration 3 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning bonus from length penalty or an LLM judge. However, the dense reward design in MRT is inspired by regret minimization and does not require an LLM judge. There have also been efforts to distill the traces generated from existing reasoning models via SFT [30, 45, 46, 54], however, these are orthogonal to our work which focuses on improving RL directly. In addition, recent work shows that RL-trained policies scale test-time compute better than SFT [40]. Meta RL. We formulate optimizing test-time compute as meta RL problem [3, 17, 18]. Concurrently, recent survey [51] posits how-to-think with meta chain-of-thought as promising direction for training the next frontier of reasoning models. In fact, prior work in RL [16, 34] shows that it is necessary to solve meta RL problem to effectively generalize to unseen initial contexts (i.e., new problems), with little bit of interaction (i.e., initial episodes or attempts). Most work in meta RL [1, 12, 28] differs in the design of the adaptation procedure. MRT is closest to meta RL methods that use in-context histories [10, 44], but differs in the design of rewards, striking balance between E-RL2 [44] that does not reward all but the last episode (only exploration), and RL2 [10] that rewards each episode (only exploitation). 3. Preliminaries and Background Problem setup. Our goal is to optimize LLMs to effectively use test-time compute to tackle difficult problems. We assume access to reward function 𝑟(x, ) : 𝒵 {0, 1} that we can query on any output stream of tokens z. For example, on math problem with token output stream z, reward 𝑟(x, z) can check if is correct. We are given training dataset 𝒟train = {(x𝑖, y* of problems x𝑖 and oracle solution traces y* that ends in the correct answer. Our goal is to use this dataset to train an LLM, which 𝑖 we model as an RL policy, 𝜋(x). We want to train LLM 𝜋 to produce stream of tokens on that achieves large 𝑟(x, z) on test problem 𝒫test. Meta RL primer. RL trains policy to maximize the reward function. In contrast, the meta RL problem setting assumes access to distribution of tasks with different reward functions and dynamics. The goal in meta RL is to train policy on tasks from the training distribution such that it can do well on the test task. We do not evaluate this policy in terms of its zero-shot performance, but let it adapt by executing adaptation episodes at test time. Most meta RL methods differ in the design of this adaptation procedure (e.g., in-context RL such as RL2 [10], explicit training [13], and latent inference [34]). 𝑖 )}𝑁 𝑖=1 4. Problem Formulation: Optimizing Test-Time Compute as Meta RL In this section, we will formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as meta RL problem. In the next section, we will show that this meta RL perspective can be used to evaluate if state-of-the-art models (e.g., Deepseek-R1 [9]) are effectively and efficiently using test-time compute. Finally, we will utilize these ideas to develop fine-tuning paradigm, called MRT, to optimize test-time compute. 4.1. Optimizing Test-Time Compute We want an LLM to attain maximum performance on 𝒫test within test-time budget 𝐶0: max 𝜋 Ex𝒫test,z𝜋(x) [𝑟(x, z) 𝒟train] s.t. x, Ez𝜋(x)z 𝐶0. (1) While this is identical to optimizing the test performance like any standard ML algorithm, we emphasize that the budget 𝐶0 used for evaluation is larger than the typical length of correct response. This means that the LLM 𝜋(x) can afford to spend part of the token budget into performing operations that do not actually solve but rather indirectly help the model in discovering the correct answer eventually. For 4 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning example, consider math proof question where the output is composed of sequence of steps. If the policy could on-the-fly determine that it should backtrack few steps and restart its attempt, it may not only increase its chances of success, but also allow the LLM to confidently identify what steps to avoid and be careful about. However, compute budget 𝐶0 does not necessarily equal to the deployment budget. The conventional way of training an LLM to attain high outcome reward [9, 22] given fixed token budget during training is suboptimal. On problems where the typical solution length is well below the maximal token budget in training, this kind of training procedure would encourage redundancy and inefficient use of tokens as the model lacks incentive to develop more succinct responses. Now if the LLM is deployed with budget less than the one used for training, yet sufficient to solve the task, the trained LLM might still not be able to finish responding. While one way to address this issue is to force the model to terminate early if it can, this strategy is suboptimal for complex problems that require the model to potentially spend more budget on attempting to discover the right approach. In other words, training to succeed in the fewest tokens can spuriously cause the model to prematurely commit to an answer upon deployment, though this is not the best strategy. Additionally, training with only outcome reward is again suboptimal since it is unable to differentiate between solutions that are still on track progress and solutions that are not on track, if they both succeed or both do not succeed. We would instead like the model to still be rewarded positively for attempting to explore multiple approaches towards solution and spending more tokens if it is on track and can succeed eventually. We therefore propose different formulation for optimizing test-time compute that trains LLMs to be optimal at spending test-time compute, agnostic of the training token budget utilized, thus alleviating any commitment to particular budget at test time. Budget-agnostic LLMs. The only approach that can guarantee optimal for any test-time compute budget is budget-agnostic strategy that imbues behavior that can work well for multiple large enough budgets. To attain high test performance, an LLM 𝜋 should exhibit behavior that trades off between exploration and exploitation to make the most use of the compute budget available. 4.2. Characterizing Optimal Use of Test-Time Compute To develop training paradigm to effectively use test-time compute, we first need to understand the characteristics of budget-agnostic LLMs that use test-time compute the most optimally. One way to characterize these LLMs is by explicitly segmenting the output stream 𝜋(x) into sequence of meaningful blocks (i.e., episodes), and viewing this sequence of episodes as some sort of an adaptation procedure on the test problem. This segmentation then allows us frame it as meta-RL problem. def = [z0, z1, , z𝑘1]1. These Formally, suppose that can be divided into 𝑘 contiguous segments episodes could consist of multiple attempts at problem [33], alternating between verification and generation [59] such that successive generation episodes attain better performance, or be paths in search tree separated by backtrack markers. Of course, we eventually want the LLM 𝜋 to succeed in the last episode it produces within the total budget, i.e., z𝑘1. However, since we operate in setting where the LLM is unaware of the test-time deployment budget, we need to make sure that the LLM is constantly making progress and is able to 1While there are many different strategies to segment into variable number of episodes, for simplicity we assume fixed number of episodes 𝑘 in our exposition. Note that if particular contains 𝑙 𝑘 natural episodes, we can always choose to merge the last 𝑙 𝑘 episodes into one for the purposes of our discussion. 5 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning effectively strike the balance between exploration, e.g., verifying the previous steps or trying different strategy or producing even wrong tokens that might help in later episodes, and exploitation: attempting to expand on committed approach. Building on this intuition, our key insight is that the adaptation procedure implemented in the test-time token stream can be viewed as running an RL algorithm on the test problem, where prior episodes serve the role of training data for this purely in-context process. Under this abstraction, an optimal algorithm is one that makes steady progress towards discovering the solution for the problem with each episode, balancing between discovery and exploitation. As result, we can use the metric of cumulative regret from RL to also quantify the optimality of this process. Definition 4.1 (Cumulative regret). Given 𝑘 episodes generated from 𝜋(x), another LLM 𝜇 that computes an estimate of the correct response given episodes so far, and the optimal comparator policy given 𝑗-episode budget as 𝜋* 𝑗 , we define cumulative regret parameterized by 𝜇 as: 𝜇 𝑘 (x; 𝜋) def = Ez𝜋(x) 𝑘1 𝐽𝑟(x; 𝜋* 𝑗 ) 𝐽𝑟(x; 𝜇(x, z0:𝑗)) . 𝑗= Here 𝐽𝑟 denotes the expected 0/1 outcome reward attained by LLM 𝜇 when conditioning on prior episodes z0:𝑗1 produced by 𝜋 and 𝐽𝑟(𝜋*) denotes the reward attained by the best possible budgetagnostic comparator 𝜋* that attains the highest test reward and can be realized by fine-tuning the base model, within 𝑗-episode test-time budget. The policy 𝜇, that we call the meta-prover policy, could be identical to or different from 𝜋 itself. For example, if each episode produced by 𝜋 ends in an estimate of the answer, then we can measure 0/1 correctness of this answer in itself for computing 𝜇 and set 𝜇 = 𝜋. 𝑘 If some episodes produced by 𝜋 do not end in final answer (e.g., episodes within the think block), we can use different 𝜇 to help us extrapolate the answer. In our experiments, 𝜇2 is the policy induced by the same underlying LLM, obtained by terminating the think block and forcing the model to estimate the best possible answer. The red colored area in Figure 1 denotes the cumulative regret. If the regret is large or perhaps even increases with the number of episodes 𝑘, then we say that episodes did not actually make meaningful progress. On the other hand, the lower the rate of growth in the cumulative regret, the more meaningful progress budget-agnostic LLM 𝜋 makes as the budget grows. 5. Case Study: Analyzing SoTA DeepSeek-R1 Having defined the notion of cumulative regret, can we now use it to analyze state-of-the-art models, such as derivatives of the DeepSeek-R1 [9] family? While we cannot necessarily assume the oracle comparator 𝜋* is given, we are still able to compare performance conditioned on different numbers of episodes in the thought block. This gives us sense of whether the cumulative regret grows only very slowly in 𝑇 . To this end, we study the behavior of the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on two datasets: AIME 2024 and subset from OmniMATH [15]. In this context, an episode is defined as continuous segment of the models thought (i.e., text enclosed in between the <think> and </think> markers) uninterrupted by words such as Wait and Alternatively which break the current flow of logic. We report our metrics in terms of the [maj@p]j metric, in which we truncate the thought block produced by the LLM to the first 𝑗 episodes (z0:𝑗1) and steer it into immediately producing the final solution 2While 𝜇 and 𝜋 share the same underlying LLM, they represent distinct policies with different trajectory distributions. 6 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (without producing more episodes) conditioned on this truncated thought block. We then sample such immediate answers 𝑝 times and run majority vote over them to produce single answer. 𝑝 and 𝑗 are variables that parameterize the metric [maj@p]j that we measure. We also found that terminating the models thinking process early requires us to incorporate an intermediate prompt that asks the model to formulate final answer based on what it already has because it has already spent enough time on this problem3. Observing [maj@p]j evolve with 𝑗 tells us if adding more episodes helps the model make meaningful progress and discover the correct solution. We compare this against the direct baseline, in which we fine-tune the base model to produce best guess responses directly (Qwen2.532B-Instruct model based on the same base model; see Appendix D). Figure 3: R1 scaling curve on Omni-MATH subset. We compare scaling up test-time compute with direct pass@k for = 1, , 32 and [maj@p]𝑗 for = 1, 2, 4, 8. Each blue point combines 5 episodes together. Analysis results. We plot the average accuracy of the model at different episodes 𝑗 = {0, , 𝑘 1} as function of the test-time compute (measured in tokens and episodes) and the episode index 𝑗 in Figure 3. In particular, we average across solutions that contain similar numbers of episodes (total episodes = 6 - 10, 26 - 30, 41 - 45) to demonstrate the relationship between steady improvement and total episodes. We plot the performance of the direct baseline in orange, and the performance of [maj@1]j at different 𝑗 in blue. The dashed green lines branching from the blue curve extend average accuracy at the end of given episode 𝑗, or alternatively, [maj@1]j (note that maj@1 = average accuracy on the given problem) to [maj@p]j for different number of solutions given the thinking trace. Takeaways. When provided with few episodes (top row in Figure 3; 6 - 10), cumulative regret is low and each new episode continuously reduces regret, whereas [maj@p]j and the direct baseline grow slower. However, in settings that require more episodes (e.g., 41-45 episodes in the bottom row and more examples in Appendix D), we find that the accuracy (blue line) does not increase with each episode, and sometimes degrades with each subsequent episode generated in the output stream. This illustrates that current training does not quite produce traces that optimize regret swiftly (Figure 3), despite it being possible to minimize regret from intermediate episodes using information present in the model (as indicated by the much better performance of [maj@p]j when the total number of episodes [41, 45]). 3We discovered that similar statements are used to limit the thinking time of R1 models when it outputs an exceedingly long solution. Following such statement, R1 would end the thinking block and give final answer. To make sure that rather premature trimming of the thought block results in natural terminations and does not alter the models abilities in detrimental manner, we manually incorporated suffix of this sort when computing [maj@p]j. The exact prompt is shown in Appendix D. Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning This result is even more surprising because: long trace with multiple sequential episodes should be perfectly capable of implementing the [maj@p]j baseline as there is no new knowledge needed to implement this baseline. It should also easily beat the direct baseline, which just reasons in direct/linear chain and does not perform long CoT reasoning. However, reasoning with sequential episodes loses to both baselines when the solution contains more episodes. Inconsistent progress with more episodes implies poor performance as we scale up test-time compute even further: if outcome-reward RL was imbuing the LLM with generalizable test-time scaling, we would expect it to impove consistently. Takeaways: Existing SoTA models do not optimize regret Additional reasoning in models trained with outcome reward RL do not consistently yield performance improvement, particularly for complex problems that require many episodes. Even when better performance can be achieved by implementing naïve strategies such as majority voting on fewer episodes, long sequential chain of thought is unable to implement those. 6. The Meta Reinforcement Finetuning (MRT) Paradigm We will now develop fine-tuning paradigm, meta reinforcement fine-tuning (MRT), that directly aims to learn budget-agnostic LLM, which makes steady progress. Abstractly, MRT fine-tunes LLMs to directly optimize (a surrogate to) cumulative regret. Figure 4: Explore/exploit spectrum. Final reward RL does not reward intermediate episodes encouraging unstructured exploration, whereas SCoRe [23, 33] constrains each episode based on its outcome reward making it too exploitative. MRT strikes balance by assigning an information gain based reward which aims to make progress in budget-agnostic setting. Optimizing outcome reward over long stream does not incentivize meaningful regret minimization over the test-time output stream. As long as the LLM finds some arbitrary way to eventually succeed, all intermediate episodes in this rollout will be equally reinforced without accounting for the contribution of every episode towards the eventual success. This is problematic for two reasons: (i) we may simply run out of the deployment token budget to discover solutions to hard problems if we are not making progress, and (ii) we will waste the token budget on easy problems that could be solved otherwise more efficiently. One way of addressing these issues is to directly optimize for the cumulative regret objective (Definition 4.1). However, this is problematic due to the presence of the optimal comparator policy 𝜋*, which we do not have access to. The inability to access 𝜋* is not new or surprising: even over training of any RL algorithm, we do not have access to the comparator policy for minimizing cumulative regret. The difference here is that this cumulative regret is not measured over training steps but rather on test-time token output on given test query (see Figure 1(b), where the regret corresponds to the shaded red area). As result, in this section, we come up with surrogate objective that trains the LLM to implement regret-minimizing strategy when deployed. This should allow us to strike balance between spending tokens on exploration and exploitation at test time (Figure 4); exploration in the sense of trying new approaches, verifying prior answers, running majority voting and exploitation in the sense of committing to simplifying an expression following given plan. 6.1. Surrogate Objectives for Minimizing Regret The regret (Definition 4.1) cannot be directly optimized since the optimal comparator 𝜋* is not known. Our main idea is that we can minimize cumulative regret over the episodes produced by 𝜋 if we optimize Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for notion of maximal progress of policy 𝜇 as more episodes are produced. To see why intuitively, we provide simple analogy with multi-armed bandit learning problem where we must learn to discover the optimal arm and rewards are not noisy. There are two behaviors that we must tradeoff to minimize cumulative regret in bandit problem: 1) stumbling upon promising but risky arms, and 2) continuing to exploit the best arm known so far. In either case, each subsequent arm pull should lead to non-zero and ideally positive improvement in the performance of an exploitation policy that aims to simply produce the best guess estimate of the optimal arm given the episodes so far. We use this framework to build simple surrogate objective. The episodes z0:𝑘 are analogous to arm pulls in our setting, with the meta-prover policy 𝜇, serving the role of the policy which aims to estimate best arm. We can hope to see regret minimized as long as the meta-prover 𝜇 makes progress, i.e., 𝐽𝑟(𝜇(x, z0:𝑗)) increases with more episodes z𝑗. Note that this does not mean that each subsequent episode z𝑗 must itself contain better solution like SCoRe [23] or RISE [33], but only that it should ideally increase the probability that 𝜇 arrives at the right answer (Figure 4). Following the formalism in Setlur et al. [38], we capture this notion of progress made by 𝜇 via advantage of an episode z𝑖 under 𝜇. Definition 6.1 (Progress). Given prior context and episode z𝑗 𝜋(c), and another meta-prover LLM 𝜇 that computes an estimate of the correct response, we define progress made by z𝑗 as 𝑟𝜇 prg(z𝑗; c) := 𝐽𝑟(𝜇(z𝑗, c)) 𝐽𝑟(𝜇(c)). 6.2. Incorporating Progress as Dense Reward Bonus Defining the standard fine-tuning loss function based on the expected final reward attained by the last episode as the following objective, ℓFT: ℓFT(𝜋) := Ex𝒟train,z𝜋(x) [𝑟(x, z)] , we can train the LLM 𝜋 either with the policy gradient obtained by differentiating Equation 2 or with SFT on self-generated data [42]. We can extend Equation 2 to incorporate progress, giving rise to the abstract training objective (c is the sequence of tokens generated so far): (2) ℓMRT(𝜋; 𝜋old) := ℓFT(𝜋) + 𝛼 x𝒟train 𝑘1 Ec𝑗1𝜋old(x), z𝑗 𝜋(c𝑗1)[𝑟𝜇 prg(z𝑗; c𝑗1)] . (3) 𝑗= The term in red corresponds to the reward bonus and it is provided under the distribution of contexts c𝑗1 consisting of prefixes produced by the previous LLM checkpoint, shown as 𝜋old. The meta prover policy 𝜇 can be any other LLM (e.g., an -instruct model which is told to utilize episodes so far to guess the best answer) or the same LLM 𝜋 itself after its thought block has terminated. Utilizing the previous policy 𝜋old in place of the current policy 𝜋 serves dual purpose: (1) akin to trustregion methods in RL [32, 35], it allows us to improve over the previous policy provably, and (2) it lends MRT amenable to more convenient implementation on top of RL or STaR infrastructure that does not necessarily require running branched rollouts [21], and can make do with an off-policy or stale distribution of contexts. Prior work [38] alleviates the need for branched rollouts by training an explicit value function, but often induces errors. Therefore, we opt to use off-policy contexts but provide additional rewards. We also remark that this additional reward can be provided to the segment of tokens spanning particular episode (per-episode reward) or as cumulative bonus at the end of the entire test-time thinking trace, with alternatives resulting in different variance for the gradient update. 9 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Unlike traditional RL that optimizes outcome rewards and recent approaches that provide step-level supervision, MRT aligns with meta-RL by operating at the meta-step (episode) level, assessing progress across complete reasoning trajectories rather than individual actions. Finally, while this objective might appear similar to that of Setlur et al. [38], we crucially note that the progress is not computed over steps appearing within one attempt (episode) but rather over episodes. With this abstract objective in place, we now write down concrete instantiations for SFT and RL. Key Ideas: The Meta Reinforcement Fine-tuning (MRT) Paradigm Our framework MRT introduces progress (Definition 6.1) as dense reward bonus to minimize cumulative regret over the test-time compute budget. This surrogate objective used by MRT should naturally result in balancing exploration and exploitation, enabling more efficient reasoning across both simple and complex problems. 7. Practical Instantiations: Dense Rewards for Optimizing Test-Time Compute We now instantiate MRT to train an LLM in way that enables it to learn to use test-time compute effectively and efficiently. We parameterize each episode as logical thought block enclosed in between the <think> markers, akin to the DeepSeek-R1 model. As shown in Figure 5 (Left), we refer to this as an openended parameterization since it does not constrain the content of each episode. With this parameterization, we optimize the objective in Definition 3 with STaR [57] and RL [41]. With STaR, this involves sampling on-policy traces, followed by behavior cloning the ones that not only succeed under the outcome reward, but also attain high progress. With RL, this involves either explicitly or implicitly adding reward bonus that corresponds to progress. We also study another backtracking search parameterization (Figure 5, Right) where the model alternates between complete solution attempts and backtracking; details of this approach along with empirical results are provided in Appendix A. We present results for only one evaluation corresponding to the backtracking search parameterization in Section 8.4, and defer the remainder of the results to the appendix. Figure 5: The two settings we study. Left: open-ended parametrization. The model uses explicit thinking markers (<think> and </think>) to work through problem with multiple strategies. Right: backtracking search. The model directly solves the problem with step-by-step solution. In each episode, the model identifies errors at specific steps and backtracks to correct them (returning to step 3, then later to step 7) until reaching the correct answer. 7.1. STaR and RL Variants of MRT We build two variants of MRT that leverage on-policy rollouts to optimize test-time compute by maximizing dense rewards based on progress. The first variant is based on STaR and the other one uses RL. The STaR variant of MRT leverages self-generated rollouts from the base model 𝜋𝑏 to create filtered dataset of high-quality traces for SFT. For each input prompt x, we sample an initial trace between 10 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Figure 6: MRT implementation. Left: The STaR variant begins by generating complete rollout for each query sampled from dataset 𝒟train. Then, MRT segments thinking traces into distinct episodes z𝑗 akin to our analysis in Section 5. For each prefix z0:𝑗, we estimate reward 𝐽𝑟(𝜇(z0:𝑗, x)) by evaluating the average accuracy of solutions produced after terminating the thought block at this prefix. After computing rewards across all prefixes, we calculate progress 𝑟𝜇 prg(z0:𝑗; 𝑥) using Definition 6.1. The STaR variant selectively retains only reasoning traces that maximize progress and are also followed by correct solutions once thinking terminates. Right: The RL variant initiates by generating partial rollout for each query sampled from 𝒟train, terminating after random number of episodes. Then it generates 𝑚 on-policy rollouts that terminate reasoning at the prefix and immediately produce final solutions as well as rollouts that continue reasoning. Normalizing rewards across this set of traces allows us to implicitly compute the progress bonus. Finally, we update the policy with an aggregation of this dense reward and the final 0/1 outcome reward. <think> tags. We then segment the reasoning trace into episodes z0, z1, , z𝑛. The meta-prover policy 𝜇 is implemented as the policy that forcefully terminates the thought block with the time is up prompt (Appendix D; used in our analysis) and forcing the model to produce solution given prefix: 𝜇(x, z0:𝑗) def = 𝜋𝑏(x, z0:𝑗, [time is up], </think>) (4) We compute progress 𝑟𝜇 prg(z𝑗, x) according to Definition 6.1. Now, we filter for episodes z0:𝑗 that satisfy two criteria: (1) they achieve maximum progress, i.e., 𝑗 = arg max𝑗 prg(z𝑘; c𝑘1), where c𝑘1 (x, z0:𝑘1) and (2) they eventually succeed, i.e., if 𝜇(x, z0:𝑗) then 𝑟(x; y) = 1. And finally, we run SFT on these traces, and repeat the process for multiple iterations. 𝑘=0 𝑟𝜇 𝑗 The RL variant of MRT implements similar concept of progress using online RL methods (e.g., GRPO [41] or PPO [36]). For each episode, we first compute rewards for thought prefixes using the meta-prover 𝜇 defined in Equation 4 (Figure 6). The model then samples multiple on-policy rollouts conditioned on this prefix, evenly divided between continuing to reason and terminating right after the prefix of the thinking trace and producing the best-guess solution. During training, we optimize the reward defined in Equation 3 rather than just the binary outcome reward. While this procedure can be implemented with episode-specific reward bonuses or single progress adjusted reward, we opt for the latter approach due to its plug-and-play nature in current outcome-reward RL implementations. 8. Experimental Evaluation We now evaluate the efficacy of MRT in optimizing test-time compute. In particular, we are interested in the efficacy of MRT in attaining the highest possible accuracy, while being the most compute efficient. We discuss our main results below, then compare the efficiency of MRT against other prior methods, and finally end with ablation experiments studying the relationship between token budget and progress. 11 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Base model + Approach DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview outcome-reward RL (GRPO) length penalty MRT (Ours) R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outcome-reward RL (GRPO) MRT (Ours) AIME 2024 AIME AMC 2023 MinervaMATH MATH500 42.8 44.5 (+1.7) 40.3 (2.5) 47.2 (+4.4) 28.7 29.8 (+1.1) 30.3 (+1.6) 36.7 39.3 (+2.6) 30.3 (6.4) 39.7 (+3.0) 26.0 27.3 (+1.3) 29.3 (+3.3) 83.0 81.5 (1.5) 77.3 (5.7) 83.1 (+0.1) 69.9 70.5 (+0.6) 72.9 (+3.0) 24.6 24.7 23.0 24.2 19.8 22.1 22.5 85.2 84.9 83.2 85.1 80.1 80.3 80.4 Avg. 54.5 55.0 (+0.5) 50.8 (3.7) 55.9 (+1.4) 44.9 46.0 (+1.1) 47.1 (+2.2) Table 1: Pass@1 performance of RL-trained MRT models on various math reasoning benchmarks. We compare models trained with MRT, outcome-reward RL with GRPO, and length penalty against baseline models. Results show that MRT consistently outperforms other training approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in its size category. MRT leads to 2-3x improvement in accuracy over the base model compared to that of outcome-reward GRPO. Note that both base models are already trained with RL on potentially larger superset of prompts, or distilled from RL trained models, and thus we should expect the gains from any subsequent fine-tuning to be small in absolute magnitude. Despite this, we observe statistically significant and systematic gain with MRT, which is 2 3 of the gain from outcome-reward training. 8.1. Experimental Setup We use MRT to fine-tune base models that can already produce traces with <think> markers. For the STaR variant, we utilized DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B for our base models. We fine-tune them on 10,000 randomly sampled problem-solution pairs from NuminaMath [25] and estimate the progress bonus for backtracking by rolling out each prefix 20 times. Here, we compare MRT, which incorporates progress as bonus, versus vanilla STaR which only uses outcome reward. For the RL variant, we utilized DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview as base models (omitting the 7B model due to higher training compute requirements), where we compare MRT with outcome-reward RL (vanilla GRPO [41]). We finetuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B with MRT on 4,000 NuminaMath problems, while DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, which had already undergone one round of outcome-reward RL finetuning on 40K MATH problem-answer pairs, was finetuned only on 919 AIME problems from 1989-2023. We also compare MRT to an RL approach that explicitly penalizes the token length. The average number of tokens in response on evaluation prompts is around 8k, therefore, we fine-tune with 16K maximum token budget and evaluate at the same budget. More details are outlined in Appendix B.1, and complete set of hyperparameters can be found in Appendix B.2. 8.2. Results for MRT Following the protocol in Luo et al. [27], we report the pass@1 performance of outcome-reward RL and MRT on multiple math reasoning datasets: AIME 2025, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MinervaMATH, and MATH500, using 20 samples per problem to reduce noise due to limited size. As shown in Table 1, MRT outperforms training on the same dataset without the dense reward bonus. We additionally make number of interesting observations and draw the following takeaways: State-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, our models fine-tuned on top of the DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview base model achieve state-of-the-art performance for their size. The absolute performance gains are small because we train on top of distilled or already RL-trained base models. However, the relative performance improvement from using MRT is about 2-3x compared to the performance improvement obtained from running outcome-reward RL (GRPO). Better out-of-distribution robustness. When fine-tuned on narrow dataset of AIME problems with the DeepScaleR-1.5B model, MRT not only attains better performance on AIME 2024 and 12 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning AIME 2025 evaluation sets (which is perhaps expected), but MRT also preserves performance on the AMC 2023 dataset that is somewhat out-of-distribution compared to outcome-reward RL. Larger gains with weaker models and broader training data. The gains in performance are further exaggerated on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model in comparison, since the DeepScaleR base model is already trained with RL, whereas the latter is not. We also run an additional comparison on top of the DeepScaleR-1.5B model, where we apply an explicit length penalty to improve token efficiency for the model, analogous to the approach of Arora and Zanette [2]. In agreement with the findings of this concurrent work, we find that incorporating length penalty results in worse pass@1 accuracies of the model. Figure 7: MRT (RL and STaR) results on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. We plot maj@k performance of models for = 1, 2, ..., 10 on AIME 2024 (left) and MATH500 (right). The orange lines correspond to MRT and the green lines correspond to outcome-reward training, with denoting RL and denoting STaR / SFT training. 8.3. Token Efficiency of MRT So far we have seen that MRT can improve performance beyond standard outcome-reward RL in terms of pass@1 accuracy. Next, we try to evaluate whether MRT (RL) also leads to an improvement in the token efficiency needed to solve these problems. To plot token efficiency, we train the model with 16K context window and compute maj@K on multiple reasoning and solution traces sampled from the LLM. Plotting maj@K against token usage provides us with an estimate of the model performance per token. As shown in Figure 7, in both STaR and RL settings, MRT outperforms the base model by an average of 5% accuracy given the same number of tokens on AIME 2024. Moreover, MRT (RL) requires 5x fewer tokens on AIME 2024 and around 4x fewer tokens on MATH 500 to achieve the same performance as the base model (DeepSeek-R1 distilled Qwen-1.5B model in this example). In similar vein, MRT improves over outcome-reward RL by 1.2-1.6x in token efficiency. These results demonstrate that MRT significantly improves token efficiency while maintaining or improving accuracy. We also evaluated training 7B base models MRT (STaR). We present these results in Appendix C.1. 8.4. Linearized Evaluations in the Backtracking Search Setting Recall that in this setting the model is constrained to producing solution followed by explicit error detection followed by revision (Figure 5). The details for how the method is implemented is shown in Appendices B.1 and B.3. When training with MRT, we used Llama-3.1-8B and 3B base models. To generate the training data, we use 20K ranomly-sampled question-solution tuples from the NuminaMath dataset, and sample responses and backtracks from Llama-3.1-8B model for warmstart SFT phase before running RL training. Our evaluation uses AIME problems from 1989-2023 as challenging hold-out dataset, where Llama-3.1 8B achieves pass@10 30%, much lower than the 60% on NuminaMATH 13 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Figure 8: Left: MRT (STaR) with 8B base. We plot maj@K performance of models on AIME for [1, 10] against the total tokens spent. We also run linearized search (dashed line) for MRT (rest are parallel). Right: MRT (RL) with 3B base. Similarly to the left plot, we report maj@K against the total tokens spent. training set. We compare to outcome-reward RL, but also compare MRT (STaR) to RISE [33], selfcorrection approach which does not utilize backtracking but just revises the solution. Evaluation protocol. Following prior work [33], in this setting, we evaluate MRT in two modes: (i) parallel mode: sampling 𝑁 independent three-episode traces (generate-backtrack-revise) per problem and computing maj@N for evaluation; and (ii) linearized mode: running 𝑁 sequential episodes of backtracking in sliding window fashion while retaining the last 2048 tokens, which allows for generating very long but coherent outputs, much longer than the allowed context length for training. Note that this kind of sliding window evaluation was not possible for the open-ended parameterization, but the use of more rigid definition of episodes and the Markov property allows us to extrapolate far beyond here. Results for MRT (STaR). We first evaluate the STaR variant of MRT when fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B model. As shown in Figure 8 (left), MRT achieves the highest test-time efficiency in both evaluation modes (parallel in solid lines; linearized in dashed lines) and improves efficiency by over 30% in the linearized evaluation mode. While RISE [33]which does not explicitly model backtracking and does not account for progressalso improves performance, it does so inefficiently, trailing behind MRT in both the peak performance attained and the number of tokens needed to attain this performance. Results for MRT (RL). Finally, we evaluate the RL variant of MRT on top of GRPO [41] when fine-tuning 3B model after warmstart SFT (Section A.2). Figure 8 (right) shows that MRT (RL) improves linearized efficiency by reducing tokens by 1.6x compared to outcome-reward GRPO. Summary of results: MRT improves performance and token efficiency MRT outperforms outcome rewards in both open-ended parameterizations and backtracking search, most notably leading to 2-3x larger relative gains over outcome-reward GRPO. In linearized evaluation with sliding windows, MRT enhances token efficiency by over 1.6-1.7 compared to approaches for self-correction (RISE [33]) and outcome-reward training (GRPO [41]), scaling token efficiency by 1.5 over GRPO trained model, and 5 over the base model. 8.5. Ablation Studies and Diagnostic Experiments Next, we perform controlled experiments to better understand the reasons behind the efficacy of MRT. We aim to answer the following questions: (1) Do MRT (RL) and MRT (STaR) reduce cumulative regret and make more progress compared to outcome-reward RL and STaR? And (2) What is the relationship 14 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Figure 9: Normalized regret of different algorithms at different deployment @token budgets 𝐶0. The first four points are at budgets 4096, 8192, 12288, and 16384. The next four points in dashed lines are extrapolations to 𝐶0 = 20480, 24576, 28672, and 32768, which correspond to 2, 4, 6, and 8 extensions of the output trace, following the budget forcing technique in s1 [30]. In the left plot, we run the STaR variant of MRT and the right plot corresponds to the DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview base model where we run the RL variant. In both cases, we conduct this study on AIME 2025. Observe that MRT leads to the smallest normalized regret, both when evaluating within the maximal budget and when extrapolating to larger budgets, even when outcome-reward training (e.g., Qwen-7B STaR) starts to plateau and collapse to the base model. between token length and progress? How does length evolve during MRT (RL)? In this section, we present some ablation experiments to answer these questions. 8.5.1. Question 1: Progress Made By MRT Compared to Outcome-Reward Training We measure the regret from Definition 4.1 against an optimal theoretical policy 𝜋* that achieves perfect accuracy in one episode. While Definition 4.1 measures regret 𝜇 as function of the number of episodes 𝑘 𝑘, to fairly compare different fine-tuning algorithms, we instead reparameterize regret to be function of token budget 𝐶0 for this study. Since traces from different algorithms can differ in the number of episodes, cumulative regret per token provide more apples-to-apples comparison of progress. Specifically, we measure the scaling curve (blue curve in Figure 1) and cut it off at varying budgets of 𝐶0. We then measure the area ratio between the scaling curve at different values of 𝐶0 and the constant oracle performance of 1.0 (visually depicted as the shaded red area in Figure 1). Finally, we report this regret normalized by 𝐶0 in Figure 9. low and steadily decreasing value of normalized regret indicates that the red area in Figure 1 becomes narrower as the number of tokens increases. Empirically, we see in Figure 9 that the normalized regret for MRT decreases faster compared to both the base model and outcome-reward RL when the total token budget 𝐶0 16384, the token budget used for training. In Figure 9, we also include token budgets that extrapolate beyond training budget, shown in the dashed lines. To do so, we force the model to continue thinking using the budget forcing approach of Muennighoff et al. [30]. Even in extrapolation, MRT continues to have the lowest normalized regret, indicating better progress at larger budgets. We present detailed version of this study in Appendix F. 8.5.2. Question 2: Evolution of Length and Progress over Training Finally, we study the relationship between progress and response length, which is believed to be crucial enabling factor behind the recent results from DeepSeek [9] and others [22]. We are interested in understanding: a) how does length evolve during training with MRT and outcome-reward RL, over an i.i.d. prompt distribution? And b) Can the benefits of increasing output token budget be explained by 15 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning implicitly improving progress? We present results to answer these questions below. a) Evolution of completion length during training. As shown in Figure 10, we find that in general, the average completion length roughly oscillates around given range of 5000 tokens during training with both MRT (RL) and GRPO on the AIME dataset (same setup as Table 1). We also note that compared to GRPO, MRT slightly reduces length (i.e., the orange curve generally falls below the green curve), which aligns with our expectation that optimizing for progress should lead to some amount of reduction in token length (consistent with Figure 7). However, this decrease in response length is not as large as the one seen from an explicit length penalty, which reduces length at the cost of worse performance as shown in Table 1. We observe similar result in the backtracking setting in Figure 20. Figure 10: Evolution of length during RL training. Length largely oscillates around similar values for the most part of training, after an initial increase from the initialization length. b) Progress explains the benefits of increasing output token budget during training. Despite the supposed gains from running RL training with large output budget right from the beginning [9, 22], several analyses and reproduction studies [26, 27, 55, 58] have found that that training at higher budgets (e.g., budget of 16K for AIME evaluations) results in inefficient use of compute. Concurrent work, Luo et al. [27], finds that more performant approach is to instead initialize RL training with smaller output token budget of 8K tokens and then expand this budget to 16K after training for some time. This raises the question: what benefits does curriculum over output token budget provide in this setup? In the following discussion, we argue that the benefits of such curriculum can be explained by increased progress or lower cumulative regret in our formulation. Figure 11: (Source: [27]) DeepScaleRs average response length and training rewards as training progresses. We start by revisiting the trend in completion length and performance observed by DeepScaleR [27] in Figure 11. Observe that when finetuning with an 8K context window (training steps 0 to 1000), performance increases while length reduces, implying that an increase in length is not necessary for performance to go up. More interestingly, this trend also indicates that the LLM makes better progress on average during this phase. In particular, the change in accuracy per token/episode is higher than when the token budget is 16K in Figure 12: Regret for 8K and 16K DeepScaleR checkpoints at different budgets 𝐶0. For budgets beyond 8192, we calculate the normalized regret of the 8K checkpoint by extrapolating it with budget forcing. At nearly all budgets, the 8K checkpoint shows lower normalized regret, indicating better progress. 16 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning the next phase, in which both performance and length increase. To corroborate this claim, we compute the normalized regret in Figure 12. We observe that the 8K checkpoint indeed attains lower regret, meaning each episode in this LLM makes more progress compared to the model trained on 16K. In fact, even when we extrapolate the budget for the 8K checkpoint to 16K evaluation tokens via budget forcing, we attain normalized regret similar to the subsequent checkpoint obtained after growing the budget to 16K tokens. Concurrent work [27, 55] observes that training with length curriculum achieves better performance than training with budget of 16K from scratch. So, the first phase of training on smaller (8K) token budget results in a) higher progress (lower cumulative regret) and b) better performance than training with larger context length, because the latter does not explicitly maximize progress. All of this implies that progress is critical towards driving the benefits of long lengths. Our main takeaway is that while training with long completion length alone does not always encourage steady progress Liu et al. [26], Yeo et al. [55], some form of an iterative budget curriculum or the dense reward bonus in MRT can optimize progress. Similar multi-stage training strategies were found critical by prior work training for self-correction [23, 33]. Of course, it is an open question as to how we should instantiate such an iterative training procedure to maximize progress more directly. Insights from ablations: Progress vs length in optimizing test-time compute Simple length penalties improve token efficiency but ultimately sacrifice peak performance. Using dense rewards in MRT increases performance while slightly reducing length, which is net positive on token efficiency. Existing approaches for using curricula over the training budget or multi-stage training serve as an implicit way to encourage progress during RL training. 9. Discussion, Future Work, and Conclusion We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute from the lens of meta reinforcement learning (RL) and introduce cumulative regret as principled measure of the efficacy of using test-time compute. We then analyze the performance of existing state-of-the-art models trained with outcome-reward RL and find that they do not quite optimize regret and often fail to answer novel questions within the token budget. We localize the problem to be result of maximizing outcome rewards only within fixed token budget during training. This procedure does not contain enough discriminative power to prefer approaches that arrive at the right answer by attaining lower regret and is unable to reward the LLM for making progress, i.e., being on the right track even if it is unable to arrive at the right answer eventually. To address these shortcomings of training with outcome-reward RL, we propose MRT, paradigm that formulates optimizing test-time compute as minimizing cumulative regret. By developing surrogate objective that incentivizes progress at each intermediate episode of generation, we are able to train LLMs that explicitly minimize cumulative regret. In practice, this translates to dense reward bonus based measuring the improvement in the probability of success under policy that guesses the best-possible answer given the current generation. Empirically, MRT demonstrates improved final performance, lower regret (improved efficacy of test-time compute), and better extrapolation to higher test-time budgets. Despite the efficacy of our approach, there are number of limitations, which warrant open problems that we believe the community should study. We discuss few below. Choice of 𝜇 in MRT. In this work, we simply choose 𝜇 to be the policy that produces the best guess solution conditioned on the thinking trace so far. But it remains unclear if this is the best choice of 𝜇. How can we design good 𝜇? What are some desirable properties of this meta-prover 𝜇? Are 17 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning there other 𝜇-free parameterizations of dense reward bonuses that would do even better? Characteristics of the base model for MRT. Another open question is to determine the right set of behaviors in the base model. In particular, we find that all base models in our experiments are restricted to generally producing relatively narrow set of strategies and behaviors when spending test-time compute. We believe that MRT will be even more powerful than outcome-reward RL if the base LLM could choose from broader set of strategies as is also the case with Setlur et al. [38]. Implementation with branched rollouts. We chose to apply dense rewards at the end of the entire trace. This should, in theory, be equivalent to doing so at the rollout level, albeit it increases variance of the policy gradient estimator substantially. How can we implement branched rollouts, from different meta-prover policy, in computationally-efficient manner? Understanding the tradeoff between train-time and test-time compute. MRT requires spending more train-time compute (e.g., sampling more episodes) for better test-time performance over outcome-reward RL. We believe that even under total FLOPs-matched evaluation, akin to Snell et al. [43] and Setlur et al. [38], MRT should outperform outcome-reward RL. It would be interesting to study setting with total FLOPs matched evaluation more systematically and formally."

            "content": "A. MRT with the Backtracking Search Parameterization In addition to the open-ended parameterization discussed in the main text, we explore more structured approach to episode parameterization that we call backtracking search. In this setting, we design episodes to alternate between: (1) an attempt to solve the problem, and (2) an attempt to discover errors in the preceding attempt, followed by determining an appropriate step to backtrack to. This parameterization explicitly encourages the model to develop error detection capabilities and strategic backtracking, without the use of any <think> markers. Note that the use of no specific <think> marker, and the requirement for each alternate episode to end in some estimate of solution makes this parameterization be substantially restricted compared to the open-ended setting. That said, this structural constraint of alternating between generation and verification enables us to extrapolate indefinitely by simply filling the context window with the last few related episodes and letting the model run on these. We refered to this as sliding window based linearized evaluation in the main text. Figure 13: On-policy rollout generation for MRT in the backtracking search setting. MRT allows the model to learn to backtrack (z1) and generate the corrected attempt (z2) with progress-adjusted reward. Figure 14: Different data construction schemes for obtaining warmstart SFT data for the backtracking search setting. MRT traverses two paths with the shared prefix, making use of backtracking, which RISE style approaches. A.1. STaR and RL Variants of MRT in the Backtracking Search Setting In this setting, episodes explicitly alternate between generation solution trace and explicitly implementing process to implement form of error correction and backtracking procedure (Figure 5). Concretely, given an initial response z0 𝜋𝑏(x), the subsequent episode z1 is backtracking episode where the model identifies errors in z0, followed by corrected attempt z2. Similar to the open-ended setting, in the backtracking search setting, the STaR variant filters on-policy traces (generation of on-policy data depicted in Figure 13) based on (1) correctness of z2, i.e., 𝑟(x; z2) = 1, and (2) high progress backtracks, as measured by large value of 𝑟𝜇 prg(z𝑗; c). The RL variant follows similar principle but directly optimizes the progress-adjusted reward rather than the binary outcome, ensuring backtracking leads to meaningful improvements. Finally, we note that although we only train the LLM to optimize for one backtrack, one can run several rounds of backtracks iteratively. A.2. Initialization with Warmstart SFT For the backtracking search setting, we found that base pre-trained LLMs lacked the ability to sample meaningful backtracking operations due to low coverage over such behavior in the pre-training data. This inability to sample backtracks at all, will severely inhibit learning during RL and STaR that rely on self-generated 24 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning rollouts. Therefore, before running MRT in the backtracking setting, we had to run an initial phase of warmstart supervised finetuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with basis of backtracking behavior. To do so without human supervision, we generated multiple solution traces by running beam search against the 0/1 outcome reward on every training problem, using rollouts to replace process reward model (PRM) [43]. We then generated SFT traces by traversing this tree using number of heuristics (see Figure 14). We found that backtracking to nodes in the prefix of an attempt that attain high estimated success rate, followed by completing the solution from there on, resulted in an SFT dataset that was easy to fit without memorization, when normalized for the same token budget. On the other hand, SFT datasets generated by stitching arbitrary incorrect solutions from the beam search tree with correct solution (e.g., RISE) and direct answer traces were both harder to fit as evidenced by the trend in the training loss in Figure 15. Warmstart SFT was not needed for open-ended parameterizations from R1-distilled checkpoints. Figure 15: Training loss for warmstart SFT on multiple data configurations: random stitching (RISE [33]), STaR (rejection sampling), and our warmstart SFT data (Backtrack). lower loss implies ease of fitting this data. A.3. Progress Made by MRT Compared to Outcome-Reward Training We plot the histograms of the progress estimates (Definition 6.1) on episodes obtained by running evaluation rollouts from MRT. We compare them with the progress made by outcome-reward training in Figure 16. Observe that MRT exhibits net positive and higher progress over the backtracking episode compared to RISE and outcome-reward RL respectively. This corroborates the idea that MRT does enhance the progress made by the algorithm. Figure 16: Progress histograms in the backtracking search setting over the backtracking episode for RISE and MRT (STaR) on the left and GRPO and MRT (RL) on right, computed on the evaluation set. In each case, using reward values prescribed by MRT amplifies information gain on the test-time trace, enabling it to make consistent progress. 25 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning B.

Observe that MRT attains the best performance as more tokens are sampled. D. Full Analysis of DeepSeek-R1 In this section we will give more detailed outline on our analysis of DeepSeek-R1 derivates from Section D. We focus our analysis primarily on subset of 40 problems taken from Omni-MATH. We chose Omni-MATH because it is not an explicit benchmark that DeepSeek-R1 reports [9] and is still challenging for many models. We chose 10 problems from each of the difficulty levels 4, 4.5, 5, and 5.5. The reason for doing this is to better capture the models ability to make progress, which would not be apparent if the model got an accuracy near 0 or 100. We additionally also performed our analysis on the 30 problems from AIME 2024, which is commonly-studied benchmark that we also report on in the main text. The first step in our analysis is to generate solutions to problems with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the model in the R1 family that we analyze. For each problem, we sample 4 responses at temperature of 0.7 and 8192 maximum token length. We obtain our direct pass@k baseline with the same settings on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, except that we obtain 32 responses to simulate pass@32. Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct shares the same base model as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, but it is fine-tuned only on direct reasoning chains that do not employ thinking strategies such as backtracking and verification. Construction of episodes. After we have obtained these initial completions, we separate them into episodes by filtering for explicit phrases that indicate disruption in the natural flow of logic. We further constrain each episode to be at least three steps (each step is an entry separated by the delimiter nn) to avoid consecutive trivial episodes. The explicit phrases are listed in Figure 21. If step begins with one of these phrases, then we consider it to be the beginning of new episode. The number of episodes depends on the problem and particular solution that was sampled. The distribution is shown in Figure 23. Due to the large number of episodes, we group the episodes into groups of 5 for Omni-MATH and groups of 3 for AIME, so each point on the blue curve in Figures 24 and 25 represents 5 or 3 episodes. Experimental setup. For each prefix of episodes z0:𝑗1, where 𝑗 is multiple of 5 or 3 respectively (as discussed in the previous paragraph), we ask the model to terminate its thinking, summarize its existing work, and give an answer. This is the way we approximate the computation of the best-guess policy 𝜇(x, z0:𝑗1), as discussed in Section D. To ensure natural termination, we append the prompt shown in Figure 22 to the end of the prefix so that the model computes 𝜇(x, z0:𝑗1). This is repeated 8 times on every prefix to simulate maj@8, at temperature 0.7 and 4096 max tokens. Finally, we compute blue ([maj@1]j at 𝑗 values) and green curves (for each 𝑗, [maj@p]j at 𝑝 = 1, 2, 4, 8) in Figures 24 and 25. Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Explicit step prefixes for separating episodes in R1 solution Wait But wait Alternatively Is there another way to think about this? But let me double-check But hold on Figure 21: Explicit step prefixes for separating episodes in R1 solution. This is list of phrases that indicate disturbance in the natural flow of logic under R1. If step begins with one of these phrases, we consider it the start of new episode. Prompt used to extract answer from R1 {Insert x, z0:𝑗1 here (think tag will be part of z0:𝑗1)} Time is up. Given the time Ive spent and the approaches Ive tried, should stop thinking and formulate final answer based on what already have. think **Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:** 1. ** Figure 22: Prompt used to extract answer from R1. We use the prompt above to simulate 𝜇(x, z0:𝑗1) and extract an answer after episodes.

We compare scaling up the test-time compute for the R1-32B distilled model with direct pass@k for = 1, 2, 8, 16, 32 against [maj@p]𝑗 for = 1, 2, 4, 8 and varying levels of 𝑗. Note that the total episodes matches the length of the blue curve. It is range rather than single number due to the concatenation of episodes into groups of 5 as mentioned in the full analysis. 32 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Figure 25: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scaling curve on AIME 2024 across different episodes. We compare scaling up R1 compute with direct pass@k for = 1, 2, 8, 16, 32 against [maj@p]𝑗 for = 1, 2, 4, 8 and varying levels of 𝑗. It is range rather than single number due to the concatenation of episodes into groups of 3 as mentioned in the full analysis. 33 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning E. Additional regret analysis of MRT models In this section, we perform the analysis in the previous section on our own MRT STaR model fine-tuned from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B to get sense of its ability to make steady progress (Figure 27) and contrast it against the baseline of tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B with STaR (Figure 28) (we repeat the same analysis in the RL setting but omit the intermediate figures since we already show the final results in Figure 26). We further condense these figures and extend the normalized regret analysis in Section 8.5.1 to answer the following question: On different LLMs, how well does [maj@1]j (blue curves in Figure 27) with more episodes 𝑗 perform compared to [maj@k]j (green curves in Figure 27) with fewer episodes 𝑗? In other words, do LLMs make meaningful progress through more sequential episodes compared to the alternative of stopping at an earlier episode and running maj@k? To answer this, we augment the setting in our original regret analysis. Instead of using the theoretically optimal policy that achieves perfect accuracy in one episode, we take the optimal policy to be the best of maj@k from an earlier episode (green curve) and maj@1 from later episode (blue curve). With this optimal policy, the regret is nonzero whenever green curve lies above the blue curve, and zero otherwise (since, in regret, we subtract the optimal policy by the blue curve). The resulting regret measures the difference in performance between [maj@k]j with fewer episodes 𝑗 and [maj@1]j with more episodes 𝑗. Additionally, to get sense of how each reasoning episode contributes to progress, we choose to look at the compute budget in episodes rather than tokens. In both STaR and RL settings, we see that MRT gives the lowest normalized regret compared to the other approaches, implying more progress made in sequential episodes compared to maj@k on fewer episodes. Figure 26: Normalized regret of different algorithms at different episode budgets. Left: MRT (STaR) on DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-7B has lower curve than STaR and Base models, indicating better progress in more sequential episodes compared to maj@k on fewer episodes. Right: MRT (RL) on DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview also shows lower curve compared to Base and GRPO, again demonstrating better progress in more sequential episodes. 34 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Figure 27: MRT STaR (on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) scaling curve on Omni-MATH subset across different episodes. We compare scaling up compute with the direct base model Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct (orange curve) pass@k for = 1, 2, 8, 16, 32 against [maj@p]𝑗 for = 1, 2, 4, 8 and varying levels of 𝑗 (blue curve and green curves). 35 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Figure 28: STaR (on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) scaling curve on Omni-MATH subset across different episodes.

Extrapolation Analysis In this section, we extrapolate our models test-time compute by using the budget-forcing technique from Muennighoff et al. [30]. This requires appending the token Wait to the end of the thought block to push the model to think more. For given thought block, we experiment with doing this procedure 0/2/4/6/8 times, each time stopping when the closing think tag is produced or when we reach maximum budget of 2048 tokens. To ensure that the model does not run into the scenario of endless repeating phrase, we iterate through the options \"Wait\", \"Alternatively\", \"But hold on\", \"But wait\" as the \"Wait\" phrase to append to the end of the thought block. The results for the extrapolation on the Qwen-7B MRT (STaR) model and for the DeepScaleR-1.5B MRT (RL) model as shown in Figure 29. Note that the numbers do not exactly match the numbers in Table 1 due to randomness. Figure 29: Extrapolation by pushing the model to think more with \"Wait\". Left: MRT (STaR). MRT (STaR) on DeepSeekR1-Distill-Qwen-7B extrapolates better than the other two approaches when budget forcing 2/4/6 times, but the performance dips at 8 times, that said the performance of STaR decreases throughout. Right: MRT (RL) on DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview without any extrapolation begins at higher accuracy, but all approaches extrapolate similarly. 37 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning G. Some Concrete Examples G.1. Backtracking Search Example of Backtrack ] ([𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 ) = 𝑎𝑑 𝑏𝑐 . The conjugate of the complex Query: type of operation is defined as follows: ]) number is ______. ([1 + 𝑖 1 3𝑖 2 ]) ([𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 is defined as (𝑎𝑑 𝑏𝑐), but this doesnt appear to be matrix operation. Instead, Solution: it seems to be determinant operation. The problem statement seems to be bit unclear, but if ([1 + 𝑖 1 3𝑖 2 as 2 2 matrix, we can calculate its we consider the given complex number ]) determinant, which would be the conjugate. Step 1: To find the conjugate of the complex number ([1 + 𝑖 1 3𝑖 2 ]) , we first need to calculate the determinant of this matrix using the formula: (𝑎𝑑 𝑏𝑐). Step 2: From the given matrix, we have 𝑎 = 1 + 𝑖, 𝑏 = 1, 𝑐 = 2, and 𝑑 = 3𝑖. Step 3: The determinant of the matrix is ((1 + 𝑖)(3𝑖) (1)(2)) = (3𝑖2 + 2). Step 4: Simplify the expression by substituting (𝑖2) with 1: (3(1) + 2) = (3 + 2). Step 5: Calculate the expression: (3 + 2 = 1). Step 6: The conjugate of complex number (𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖) is (𝑎 𝑏𝑖), so the conjugate of (1) is (1). Answer: 1 Wait, this seems off. Lets try something else. Step these (1 + 𝑖)(3𝑖) (1)(2) = 3𝑖2 + 3𝑖 + 2 = 3 + 3𝑖 + 2 = 1 + 3𝑖. Step 4: However, the conjugate of complex number is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part. Therefore, the conjugate of 1 + 3𝑖 is 1 3𝑖. Step 5: Therefore, the conjugate of determinant Plugging formula, values into the we get 3: the given complex number Answer: 1 3𝑖 ([1 + 𝑖 1 3𝑖 2 ]) is (1 3𝑖)). Figure 30: Example of backtrack trajectory used to train the model. The trajectory shows that the model first try to solve the problem, then it recognized that the prior solution is wrong from step 3, therefore, the model backtrack to step 2 in the prior solution and redo step 3 with correction. The mistake is highlighted in red, the correction is highlighted in green, and the backtracking step detection is highlighted in yellow. 38 Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning G.2. Open-Ended Parameterizations Example of Open-Ended Parameterizations Query: Point (𝑥, 𝑦) is randomly picked from the rectangular region with vertices at (0, 0), (2008, 0), (2008, 2009), and (0, 2009). What is the probability that 𝑥 > 2𝑦? Express your answer as common fraction. Solution: <think> Okay, so have this problem where point (𝑥, 𝑦) is randomly picked from rectangular region with vertices at (0, 0), (2008, 0), (2008, 2009), and (0, 2009). need to find the probability that 𝑥 > 2𝑦. Hmm, maybe should think of it as the area above the line 𝑥 = 2𝑦 within the rectangle. But actually, when 𝑥 > 2𝑦, for each 𝑦, 𝑥 starts from 2𝑦 up to 2008. So, the region is trapezoid or triangle? Let me think. The line 𝑥 = 2𝑦 goes from (0, 0) to (2008, 1004). So, above this line, within the rectangle, is region that is triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (2008, 1004), and (2008, 2009). Is that right? Wait, no. If consider 𝑥 > 2𝑦, then for each 𝑦, 𝑥 starts at 2𝑦 and goes to 2008. So, the region is actually trapezoid with vertices at (0, 0), (2008, 1004), (2008, 2009), and (0, 2009). Hmm, but (0, 2009) is not on the line 𝑥 = 2𝑦, so maybe its trapezoid. Alternatively, when integrating over the region, you can think of slicing horizontally. For each in [0, 1004], 𝑥 runs from 2𝑦 to 2008. For 𝑦 in [1004, 2009], there are no satisfying 𝑥 >= 2𝑦 because 2𝑦 >= 2008. Therefore, the area where 𝑥 > 2𝑦 is the integral from 𝑦 = 0 to 𝑦 = 1004 of (2008 2𝑦)𝑑𝑦 Time is up. Given the time Ive spent and the approaches Ive tried, should stop thinking and formulate final answer based on what already have. </think> First, total area is 2008 * 2009. Favorable area is the integral from 0 to 1004 of (2008 2𝑦)𝑑𝑦. Calculating the integral: The integral of 2008𝑑𝑦 is 2008𝑦. The integral of 2𝑦𝑑𝑦 is 𝑦2. Therefore, evaluated from 0 to 1004: [2008 * (1004) (1004)2] [0 0] = 2008 * 1004 (1004)2 = (2008 1004)1004 = 1004 1004. Hold on, thats clever, it factors into 1004 squared. So the favorable area is 10042. Therefore, the probability is (10042)/(2008 * 2009). The probability is 502/2009 Figure 31: Example of trajectory generated in the open-ended setting. The trajectory shows how the model initially tries to conceptualize the problem within the \"think\" section. It changes its logical approach several times, and ultimately is forced to stop thinking and generate solution."
