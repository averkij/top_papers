Project Page: Link Figure 1 Overview of Region-level 4D Understanding. 4D region-level VQA, e.g., our R4D-Bench, requires MLLMs to be able to track regions (2D), perceive depth (3D), and temporal progression (4D). Baseline MLLMs cannot recognize one or more of these aspects and thus fail to answer questions correctly. With our distillation framework, our 4D-RGPT better perceives these aspects and answers accurately. We note that the regions labeled with (*) are not provided in R4D-Bench; they are visualized for readability. 1. Introduction temporal visual understanding. By integrating visual inputs with Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4], Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex understanding across vision and language modalities. However, current MLLMs, even proprietary models such as GPT-4o [5], often struggle with highly specialized tasks that require fine-grained spatial1 and 1We use spatial in this paper to refer to 3D (i.e., 2D + depth), rather than 2D as in several general video understanding works. In this paper, we advance MLLMs for one such challenging task: Region-level 4D Understanding. This unique problem combines two critical aspects: (1) 4D understanding, which demands answering questions regarding depth information, temporal dynamics, or object interactions in 3D space over time; and (2) region-level understanding, which requires grounding language queries to specific visual regions for controllable input. Region-level 4D VQA is essential for demanding real-world applications, such as au1affiliated with Purdue University. Work done during Chiao-Ans internship at NVIDIA. 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation tonomous driving and industrial inspection, where 4D information is critical and user queries must precisely target specific regions rather than rely on ambiguous descriptions. As an example, in Fig. 1, the 4D question What is the average speed of 𝑅1? specifically targets the speed of the car marked by the purple bounding box 𝑅1. To achieve 4D understanding, previous works mainly rely on conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) [6, 7, 8, 9] or Reinforcement Learning (RL) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] paradigms, optimizing primarily over the final text output using self-curated data. However, due to the difficulty of curating large-scale, well-annotated dynamic video data, these works often struggle with dynamic scenarios. In regionlevel 4D VQA, having strong 4D understanding is even more critical, as it requires tracking region movement over time. More recently, several works [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] exploit external models to inject 3D knowledge into MLLMs to improve spatial understanding capabilities. However, external 3D knowledge mainly helps understand static videos, without fully achieving 4D understanding. Moreover, these approaches often integrate additional modules into the architecture, introducing additional inference burdens. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRGPT, specialized MLLM with effective 4D perception and thus better 4D understanding capabilities. 4D perception refers to the ability to extract low-level 4D perceptual knowledge, e.g., depth and optical flow. Specifically, 4D-RGPT perceives 4D knowledge via our proposed Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D) training-only framework. P4D adopts both latent and explicit distillation processes to effectively distill 4D perceptual knowledge from an expert 4D teacher model into the student 4D-RGPT. Notably, unlike previous works, P4D contains only training-only modules, incurring no additional inference cost. Finally, we introduce Timestamp Positional Encoding (TPE) to provide explicit temporal cues, enhancing MLLMs temporal perception capability. While various 3D/4D VQA benchmarks have been proposed recently [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 18], they often lack either region-prompted questions or sufficient 4D understanding challenges. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, this limitation prevents comprehensive evaluation of region-based 4D VQA capabilities, namely, answering questions about specific regions (e.g., 𝑅1) in 4D context. To bridge this gap, we construct R4DBench, new benchmark containing both static and dynamic scene understanding tasks with region-based 4D questions. Our experiments show that 4D-RGPT improves over the baseline on both non-region-based 3D/4D benchmarks (+5.3% on average across 6 benchmarks) and our region-based R4D-Bench benchmark (+4.3%), while effectively capturing explicit 4D signals. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose 4D-RGPT (Sec. 4.1), specialized MLLM that perceives 4D information for enhanced understanding. We propose the P4D (Sec. 4.2) training framework to distill 4D perceptual knowledge into 4DRGPT without introducing additional inference cost. We introduce R4D-Bench (Sec. 5), region-based 4D VQA benchmark that requires region-level 4D understanding. 2. Related Work 2.1. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) The success of LLMs [1, 2, 27, 28, 4, 29, 3] has inspired various MLLMs [30, 5, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] for multi-modal understanding or generation. While several MLLMs [37, 38, 39, 40, 41] excel at video understanding, they lack specialization in region-level or 3D/4D tasks. Region-Level MLLMs understand specified regions within visual inputs. Earlier works [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] use bounding box coordinates as text prompts, while others [52, 53, 54, 55, 20, 56] extract Region of Interest (RoI) visual features. Visual markers [57, 58, 59, 60] provide intuitive region indication. However, region-level video understanding remains challenging, especially for dynamic scenes where user queries provide sparse region annotations without temporal tracking  (Fig. 1)  . While recent works [61, 20] address this, they do not fully explore 4D dynamic scenarios. We propose 4D-RGPT (Sec. 4.1) to interpret 4D spatio-temporal knowledge without 4D annotations during training. 3D/4D MLLMs focus on spatial and temporal understanding. Previous works [17, 18, 16, 9, 62, 13, 63, 20, 24, 64] enhance MLLMs with depth or 3D reconstruction models but require additional modules, introducing inference costs. Others use SFT [6, 7, 8, 9] or RL [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] with text-based supervision, which is insufficient for 4D perception. We propose P4D (Sec. 4.2) to enhance 4D perception without modifying the architecture. 3DRS [64] employs distillation for static 3D scenes, while P4D addresses dynamic scenes with dual distillation on latent and explicit representations to achieve 4D understanding. 2 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Table 1 Comparison among 3D / 4D VQA Benchmarks. Existing benchmarks either lack dynamic video data or region prompts, while our R4DBench is the first to provide both at scale. All benchmarks are downloaded from official sources as of August 2025, and the numbers of VQA might differ from the original papers. Static videos contain only camera movement, while dynamic videos contain both camera and object movement. We only adopt real-world videos from the VLM4D benchmark. video. For example, 𝑚 can be either depth, which describes the per-pixel depth values, or flow, which describes the per-pixel optical flow between adjacent frames. We denote the input video as 𝑉 = [𝐼 (𝑛)]𝑛=1:𝑁 with each image frame 𝐼 (𝑛) R𝐻𝑊 3. Here, 𝑁 is the number of input frames and (𝐻, 𝑊 ) is the spatial size. Given 𝑉 , we can acquire its 4D latent representation as follows, Input Type FPS # Visual # QA 𝐹4D = E4D(𝑉 ) R𝑁 ℎ𝑤𝑐 , (1) Dataset Regions SAT-real [24] MMSI-Bench [26] OmniSpatial [25] VSTI-Bench [18] STI-Bench [22] Dynamic Video 10 30 VLM4D-real [23] Dynamic Video 12 24 R4D-Bench (Ours) Dynamic Video 10 30 Images Images Images Static Video - - - 24 196 2.5k 561 312 369 600 780 150 1.0k 1.5k 6k 2k 1k 1.5k where 𝑁 , ℎ, 𝑤 are the down-sampled number of frames, height, and width of E4Ds outputs and 𝑐 is the number of output channels. For each 𝑚, the decoder D𝑚 decodes 𝐹4D to its corresponding low-level representation, i.e., 2.2. 3D/4D VQA Benchmarks Several benchmarks evaluate MLLMs 3D and 4D understanding. OmniSpatial [25], VSTI-Bench [18], SAT [24], and MMSI-Bench [26] focus on 3D spatial understanding in images. STI-Bench [22] is pioneering work that introduces 4D VQA on both static and dynamic videos, while VLM4D [23] focuses on semantic understanding in dynamic videos. However, these benchmarks lack region-level prompting or sufficient dynamic video data (Tab. 1). We introduce R4D-Bench (Sec. 5) with region-level prompts and diverse 4D understanding tasks. 𝑃𝑚 = D𝑚(𝐹4D). (2) We use the following 4D modalities ℳ in this work: (a) 𝑚 = depth where 𝑃 (𝑛) depth R𝐻𝑊 1 describes the per-pixel depth values; (b) 𝑚 = flow where 𝑃 (𝑛) flow R𝐻𝑊 2 describes the per-pixel optical flow between adjacent frames; (c) 𝑚 = motion where 𝑃 (𝑛) motion R𝐻𝑊 1 describes whether pixel is moving or static in 3D space; (d) 𝑚 = camray where 𝑃 (𝑛) camray R𝐻𝑊 6 describes the per-pixel Plucker ray maps. 4. Approach 3. Preliminaries We briefly review the background and introduce notation for an MLLM and 4D perception model. Multimodal LLMs extend the understanding capabilities of LLMs to visual inputs such as images and videos. The architecture typically consists of: (a) EV: vision encoder for input visuals, e.g., images or videos; (b) EP: multi-modal projector that aligns the visual and textual features within shared space; (c) LLM: an auto-regressive model that takes in both features and generates output hidden states or tokens in step-by-step manner; (d) Dhead: linear head layer that maps the hidden states to the final vocabulary space for text generation. Overview. Given video 𝑉 and question 𝑄, an MLLM responds with an answer 𝐴 autoregressively. To tackle the complex, dynamic scenes presented in 4D VQA benchmarks, we develop an MLLM that can better answer questions by incorporating 4D knowledge from teacher model and leveraging low-level representations, e.g., depth and flow, over time. To this end, we design 4D-RGPT to capture both latent 4D features and explicit 4D signals from 𝑉 with training-only modules. These 4D representations enable the model to better perceive 4D knowledge during training, without introducing additional inference cost. Additionally, to accurately capture temporal progression for answering 4D questions, we introduce Timestamp Positional Encoding (TPE) to provide explicit temporal cues to the MLLM. 4D Perception Models, e.g., L4P [65], encode latent feature from input visuals for multiple 4D lowlevel representations. They consist of unified encoder E4D and specialized decoders D𝑚 for each 4D modality 𝑚 ℳ. Each 4D modality 𝑚 ℳ describes some per-pixel 4D properties of the input To circumvent the extreme training cost and instability of training MLLMs from scratch, we introduce our Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D) framework to distill 4D knowledge into 4D-RGPT during training. As shown in Fig. 2, our framework leverages frozen expert 4D perception model (teacher) to supervise 3 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Figure 2 Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D) framework for 4D-RGPT. For each frame 𝐼 (𝑖) in 𝑉 , 4D-RGPT extracts 4D representations through training-only modules, i.e., D4DP and D𝑚 for 𝑚 ℳ. This includes both latent features, i.e., ^𝐹4D, and explicit signals, e.g., depth ^𝑃depth or optical flow maps ^𝑃flow. We also incorporate timestamp positional encodings (TPE) to provide temporal cues for 4D-RGPT to be temporally aware. In the P4D framework, the frozen teacher, i.e., 4D perception model, captures 4D expert knowledge from 𝑉 . It is then distilled to the student 4D-RGPT via two strategies. (a) Latent Distillation (LD): We align the latent ^𝐹4D with the teachers intermediate 4D embeddings 𝐹4D. (b) Explicit Distillation (ED): We align the explicit ^𝑃𝑚 with the teachers final 4D signals 𝑃𝑚. 4D-RGPT is optimized end-to-end using both SFT loss and the distillation losses, i.e., ℒLD and ℒED. both latent and explicit 4D representations of 4DRGPT (student). The latent distillation provides intermediate guidance on abstract 4D features, while the explicit distillation ensures accurate extraction of interpretable low-level 4D signals. We describe the 4D-RGPT architecture in Sec. 4.1 and the P4D framework in Sec. 4.2. size of visual features, and 𝑐 is the hidden dimension. We introduce training-only MLP as 4D perception decoder D4DP on top of the MLLM to decode latent 4D representations ^𝐹 (𝑛) . Specifically, we first sample 4D and resize (Rearrange) the hidden 𝐹 (𝑛) to match the target shape of (𝑁 , ℎ, 𝑤) in Eq. 1. Thus, for each down-sampled frame 𝑛 [1, 𝑁 ], we have hidden 4.1. 4D-RGPT ^𝐹 (𝑛) 4D = D4DP ( Rearrange(𝐹 (𝑛) hidden ) ) . (3) 𝑛=1 𝑛=1 Given an input video 𝑉 with 𝑁 sampled frames [𝐼 (𝑛)]𝑁 of each , and the timestamps {𝑡(𝑛)}𝑁 frame, our 4D-RGPT consists of training-only 4D perception modules that can extract 4D representations for distillation in P4D (Sec. 4.2). Moreover, 4D-RGPT can perceive temporal progression by incorporating timestamp positional encodings into input In short, we use 4D perception visual features. decoder D4DP to extract latent 4D features and prediction heads D𝑚 for 𝑚 ℳ to extract explicit 4D signals. Explicit 4D Representations. Although ^𝐹4D can capture rich 4D features, explicit 4D signals, e.g., depth maps, are more interpretable and provide unambiguous supervision. To capture explicit 4D representations for P4D, we extract explicit 4D signals ^𝑃𝑚 given ^𝐹4D via the training-only prediction heads D𝑚 from the frozen 4D perception model. Specifically, for each 𝑚 ℳ, we have ^𝑃𝑚 = D𝑚( ^𝐹4D). (4) Latent 4D Representations. To capture latent 4D representations for P4D, we extract ^𝐹4D from the input video. Through the video encoder EV, multi-modal projector EP, and LLM, each frame 𝐼 (𝑛) is encoded as hidden state features 𝐹 (𝑛) hidden Rℎ𝑤𝑐, where 𝑙 = ℎ𝑤 is the number of per-image tokens, (ℎ, 𝑤) is the spatial Timestamp Positional Encoding (TPE). Accurate temporal perception, such as when an event occurred and how long an action took, is fundamental to 4D VQA. For example, to answer What is the average speed of the car?, even if the MLLM can 4 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation perceive depth and knows its displacement, it still needs to understand the time duration of the video to compute speed. Incorrect temporal perception can lead to significant errors in acquiring the displacement over the correct time duration, i.e., speed. We observe that MLLMs struggle with temporal perception when there are no explicit time cues (see the experiments in Sec. 6.3 and Tab. 6). To provide temporal cues, we encode timestamps directly into the MLLMs visual input as positional encodings. That is, for each input frame 𝐼 (𝑛) from video 𝑉 that is sampled at time 𝑡(𝑛), we add sinusoidal timestamp positional encoding 𝑝(𝑛) R𝐷 to the visual features EV(𝐼 (𝑛)) before feeding them into the EP, where 𝑝(𝑛)[2𝑖] = sin ( 𝑡(𝑛) 𝑇 2𝑖 𝐷 ) and 𝑝(𝑛)[2𝑖+1] = cos ( 𝑡(𝑛) 𝑇 2𝑖 𝐷 ) . (5) Here 𝑇 is the maximum timescale and 𝑖 is the index. 4.2. Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D) To answer 4D questions, MLLMs must understand not only semantic content but also various aspects of 4D knowledge, such as sub-pixel movements and numeric depth values. For example, to answer Is the person moving closer to the camera?, the MLLM must compare the depth values of the person across frames. Recent 3D/4D specialized MLLMs either rely on self-curated training datasets or exploit external models to enhance 3D knowledge. However, both are insufficient for MLLMs to fully achieve 4D understanding. Moreover, introducing external modules results in additional inference costs. Therefore, mechanism that provides direct supervision on the MLLMs internal 4D perception capabilities without introducing additional modules is desirable. To this end, we propose our P4D framework. We leverage an existing 4D perception model as teacher to transfer its expert representations to our student, 4D-RGPT. To ensure comprehensive knowledge transfer, we propose dual-branch distillation: latent distillation and explicit distillation. Latent Distillation. We start by introducing latent distillation to supervise the MLLMs latent 4D representations, i.e., ^𝐹4D, on the latent space. Latent distillation serves as intermediate 4D guidance to the MLLM on the latent space. Specifically, our latent distillation loss ℒLD is defined to pull the margin ΔLD between the latent 4D features from the teacher model 𝐹4D and those from the student model ^𝐹4D: ℒLD = 𝑁 𝑛=1 ΔLD(𝐹 (𝑛) 4D , ^𝐹 (𝑛) 4D ). (6) Explicit Distillation. On the other hand, we introduce explicit distillation to supervise the MLLMs explicit 4D representations, i.e., ^𝑃𝑚, on the signal space. Explicit distillation provides direct, interpretable supervision to ensure the MLLM captures accurate 4D signals in ℳ. Specifically, our explicit distillation loss ℒED is defined to pull the margin Δ𝑚 between the explicit 4D signals from the teacher model 𝑃𝑚 and those from the student model ^𝑃𝑚: ℒED = 𝑁 𝑛=1 𝑚ℳ 𝜆𝑚Δ𝑚(𝑃 (𝑛) 𝑚 , ^𝑃 (𝑛) 𝑚 ), (7) where 𝜆𝑚 describes the loss weights of each 𝑚. Training. We optimize our 4D-RGPT using both SFT and P4D. The overall loss function is combination of the standard cross-entropy SFT loss ℒSFT, latent distillation loss ℒLD, and explicit distillation loss ℒED. We train on various 3D / 4D conversation datasets, including RoboFAC [66], SAT [24], VSTIBench [18] (the training split), and Wolf [67]. Please refer to the supplementary material for more training details. 5. R4D-Bench Recently, there has been significant progress in 3D/4D VQA [22, 23, 24, 26, 25, 18]. Several new benchmarks require MLLMs to have depth perception or understand 3D interactions among objects. However, existing benchmarks do not evaluate MLLMs on 4D region-based understanding in complex, real-world scenarios. As shown in Tab. 1, they lack the following critical properties: Lack of Dynamic Scenes: Most focus on indoor scenes with minimal object interaction or constrained movement, which do not fully capture the complexity of real-world object manipulation and dynamic changes. Lack of Region Prompting: Region prompts allow controlled and intuitive user queries in VQA. Without this ability, an MLLMs interpretability and usability in practical applications are hindered. To address these gaps, we introduce R4DBench (see the rightmost example in Fig. 3), novel benchmark that challenges MLLMs with region-level 4D VQA, where depth and temporal perception are critical. Task Formulation. Given an input video 𝑉 = [𝐼 (𝑛)]𝑛=1:𝑁 of 𝑁 frames, region-prompted 4D question 𝑄, and set of region masks 𝑀 describing the 5 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Figure 3 Curation pipeline of our R4D-Bench. Given existing non-region 4D VQA benchmarks, we (a) first extract the noun keywords from the question as candidates for objects of interest. (b) Next, if ground truth segmentation masks are provided, we use them for step (d). Otherwise, we use off-the-shelf GroundingDINO [68] and SAM2 [69] to extract segmentation masks for each object of interest. (c) We generate SoM [59] image for the first frame. (d) We prompt Qwen-2.5VL [35] with the SoM image and the processed question to match the objects referred to in the question with the regions. (e) Finally, the generated matching results are verified by human experts. objects of interest in 𝑄 in 𝐼 (1), the task is to respond with the correct or most suitable answer from set of options. Benchmark. We curate R4D-Bench based on existing non-region-based 4D VQA benchmarks, i.e., STIBench [22] and VLM4D [23]. Our pipeline  (Fig. 3)  employs hybrid automated and human-verified process to transform conventional VQ pairs into highly specific region-prompted questions. The process begins with non-region-prompted 4D VQA. In the example of Fig. 3, we are given video of two persons and drone with the query question How did the person move the drone? First, we use Qwen2.5-VL [35] to perform keyword extraction (Extract) and identify objects of interest from the query question, e.g., the person and the drone. While videos from some sources, e.g., DAVIS [70], provide annotations of object masks, other real-world videos lack such detailed annotations. Hence, we leverage state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation models, i.e., GroundingDINO [68] and SAM2 [69], to generate accurate object masks (Detect & Segment) for the identified objects of interest. We then apply the segmentation masks with their corresponding keywords onto the video frame to generate an image with Set-of-Marks [59]. This serves as an intermediate and potential portrayal of the region-prompted QA before the final step of checking correctness. Since the objects of interest can be non-unique (e.g., multiple persons) and segmentation masks can be noisy, ensuring correct association between extracted keywords and found regions is critical. We check correctness with both automated and humanin-the-loop processes. We use Qwen2.5-VL [35] to automatically match the generated region marks to the entities in the question (Matching). Finally, human annotators verify and correct any mismatches (Verification). We also trim videos to ensure all RoIs are visible in the first frame. This concludes our region prompting process. The original VQA is transformed into R4D-Bench format, where entities are replaced by region tokens, e.g., How did 𝑅1 move 𝑅2? with their corresponding region masks. Statistics. Our R4D-Bench benchmark consists of 1,517 region-prompted VQAs. Each question is multiple-choice problem with four to five answer options. The benchmark provides region-prompted challenges to semantic and numerical 4D understanding in both static and dynamic scenes. The static split (418 VQAs) includes 3 categories: (1) Dimension Measurement; (2) 3D Video Grounding; and (3) Spatial Relation. The dynamic split (1,098 VQAs) includes 6 categories: (1) Counting objects; (2) Translational movement; (3) Rotational movement; (4) False Positive detection; (5) Speed & Acceleration estimation; and (6) Displacement & Path Length measurement. We provide more details for each question type in the supplementary material. 6. Experiments 6.1. Experiment Setup Benchmarks. We evaluate our 4D-RGPT on various 4D VQA benchmarks, including our R4D-Bench and existing ones, i.e., STI-Bench [22], VLM4D-real [23], OmniSpatial [25], MMSI-Bench [26], SAT [24], and VSTI-Bench [18]. Please note that the first four benchmarks are testing-only benchmarks and are disjoint from our training data. Apart from the numerical questions in VSTI-Bench, where we report relative accuracy, we report the multiple-choice accuracy for all other benchmarks. Comparison Models. We compare our 4DRGPT with various proprietary MLLMs, e.g., GPT4o [5], GPT-5 [2], Gemini-2.5-Pro [32]; open-source generalized MLLMs, e.g., Qwen2.5-VL [35]; and recent 3D/4D specialized MLLMs, e.g., SpatialRea6 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Table 2 Evaluation on non-region-level 3D / 4D benchmarks. We report the average multiple-choice accuracy () on each benchmark.

For the 4D perception model E4D and D𝑚, we follow the exact architecture and weights of L4P [65]. We document training setups in the supplementary material. 6.2. Main Results We present the effectiveness of 4D-RGPT in Tab. 2 and Tab. 3, showing improvements over baseline MLLMs. Non-region-based 4D VQA. In Tab. 2, we evaluate 4D-RGPT on several non-region-level 3D/4D VQA benchmarks, including input modalities of both images and videos. We compare with various stateof-the-art proprietary MLLMs, open-source general MLLMs, and recent 3D/4D MLLMs. 4D-RGPT consistently improves over the baseline NVILA-Lite8B by large margin across all benchmarks, especially on VLM4D [23] and VSTI-Bench [18]. Compared to other MLLMs with similar model sizes, 4D-RGPT achieves SOTA performance over opensource MLLMs and competitive performance with GPT-4o [5]. Please note that SpatialReasoner [12], ViLaSR [10], and SpaceR [13] are all trained with RL Figure 4 VQA comparison among baseline MLLMs and 4D-RGPT on R4D-Bench. For the baseline MLLMs, we use GPT-4o-20241120 [5], Qwen2.5VL-7B-Instruct [35], and NVILA-Lite-8B [36]. We note that the regions labeled with (*) or (*) are not provided in R4D-Bench; they are visualized for readability. to further boost accuracy. In Tab. 3, we present quantitative R4D-Bench. comparisons of our 4D-RGPT on R4D-Bench against other MLLMs. For fair comparison, we use SoM [59] to indicate the regions of interest for all MLLMs. Additionally, for all open-source MLLMs and 4D-RGPT, we use the same number of sampled frames, i.e., 16 frames. We observe that although SpaceR [13] outperforms Qwen2.5-VL [35] in Tab. 2, it falls behind on R4D-Bench, suggesting that SpaceR is highly tuned for non-region VQA and its region understanding is weakened. Overall, 4D-RGPT achieves the best performance among all open-source MLLMs by at least 1.6% on average and 2.6% on the dynamic split. In Fig. 4, we showcase two cases of 4DRGPT against other MLLMs on R4D-Bench. In both cases, the regions of interest are constantly moving. Only 4D-RGPT effectively perceives the 4D dynamics and provides the correct answers. 6.3. Ablation Studies To justify our various designs, we conduct extensive ablation studies and analysis. For most experiments in this subsection, we report results on STI-Bench [22] and the static and dynamic question subsets of R4DBench. Without specific notes, we use the same training data, and all other components are kept identical unless specified. Alternative Strategies. Besides P4D, there are other strategies to utilize 4D conversation data or the latent feature 𝐹4D from the 4D perception models to 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Table 3 Evaluation on R4D-Bench. We report performance on the static split (Sta ), the dynamic split (Dyn), and all 9 tasks of R4D-Bench. For simplicity, we abbreviate them as follows: 3D Video Grounding ( VG ); Dimension Measurement (DM ); Spatial Relationship ( SR); Rotational ( R); Counting (C); Translational (T ); False Positive (FP); Speed & Acceleration (SA); and Displacement & Path Length (DP).

For simplicity, we use the same abbreviations as Tab. 4 and Depth (D), Flow (F), Motion (M), and Camray (C) for each 𝑚 ℳ. Table 4 Alternative strategies for 4D VQA. We compare P4D with direct SFT (4DSFT) and straightforward designs of incorporating 𝐹4D from the 4D perception model, i.e., 4DConcat and 4D-PE. For simplicity, we use the same abbreviations as in Tab. 3 and STI for STI-Bench [22].

We visualize the progress of ^𝑃depth throughout training. enhance MLLMs 4D understanding. First, denoted as 4D-SFT, we apply solely SFT to the entire MLLM without access to 𝐹4D. Additionally, there are two straightforward ways to leverage 𝐹4D. Denoted as 4D-Concat, we directly concatenate 𝐹4D with the 2D visual features 𝐸V(𝑉 ). We note that this requires additional training on EP as the dimension differs from the original visual features. On the other hand, denoted as 4D-PE, we project 𝐹4D to positional encodings (PE) for the visual features, similar to the spatial PE proposed in SR-3D [20]. As shown in Tab. 4, apart from 4D-PE, both 4DSFT and 4D-Concat improve over the Zero-shot baseline. However, they all fall short compared to P4D. Moreover, 4D-Concat and 4D-PE require additional inference costs as they need to compute 𝐹4D for each input during inference. In comparison, P4D requires solely training-only 4D perception modules, making 4D-RGPT as efficient as Zero-shot during inference. Perceptual 4D Distillation. To validate the effectiveness of P4D, we experiment with various distillation strategies used in latent distillation (ℒLD in Eq. (6)) and explicit distillation (ℒED in Eq. (7)). In Tab. 5, we ablate different combinations of distillation on ^𝐹4D and ^𝑃𝑚. We first observe that applying ℒLD alone (LD-only) improves the performance over the Zero-shot baseline by 2.3% on R4D-Bench. For ℒED, adding more 𝑚 ℳ incrementally improves the performance steadily, with 𝑚 = depth and 𝑚 = flow being the most effective ones (see LD+D and LD+D+F). While ℒED alone (EDonly) also improves the performance on R4D-Bench by 1.9%, combining both (LD+ED) achieves the best average performance, showing the complementary benefits of both LD and ED. 4D Perception Visualization. In Fig. 5, we visualize the progress of how 4D-RGPT learns to extract 4D signals through P4D. We show video from our training set [66] with extracted ^𝑃depth at various steps. ^𝑃depth is barely meaningful at first but gradually captures the 3D structure of the scene as training 8 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Table 6 Ablation studies on explicit temporal cues. We experiment without and with different choices of explicit time cues. For simplicity, we use the same abbreviations as Tab. 4. Table 7 Ablation studies on different training designs in 4D-RGPT. We ablate different training designs on whether each module is trainable and whether to use LoRA [78]. For simplicity, we use the same abbreviations as Tab. 4.

This indicates that P4D successfully distills 4D perception capabilities into 4D-RGPT. Timestamp Positional Encoding (TPE). MLLMs often struggle with temporal perception when no explicit time cues are provided. We conduct controlled toy experiment to validate this observation by curating simple benchmark with VQAs that require temporal perception, such as How many seconds have passed in the input video? We observe that NVILALite-8B [36] is naively guessing the answers, resulting in accuracy close to random guessing. This problem is further exacerbated by the inconsistency among multiple sources of data with different frame rates. We detail the toy experiment in the supplementary material. Without introducing additional modules, we test two simple solutions to provide explicit temporal cues to MLLMs. First, denoted as P4D+mark, we add explicit time marks similar to SoM [59] on each 𝐼 (𝑛), such as burned-in text showing the timestamp, e.g., 𝑡(𝑛) Second, denoted as P4D+prompt, we add explicit time information in 𝑄, such as The following video frames are sampled from video 19 seconds long and recorded at 30 frames per second. Both P4D+mark and P4D+prompt, as shown in Tab. 6, can improve 4D VQA performance. However, they require additional data preprocessing, distract MLLMs from the main visual and textual content, and do not generalize well to region-level settings, i.e., R4D-Bench. Our P4D+TPE consistently improves performance across both benchmarks, as shown in the last row of Tab. 6. Architecture Design. In Tab. 7, we ablate different designs on whether EV, EP, or LLM is trainable or frozen. Our Tune-P+LLM achieves the best performance by tuning both EP and LLM, while keeping EV frozen. This is likely because EP requires finetuning for TPE and P4D works best on LLM.

Conclusion We show that existing MLLMs struggle with regionlevel 4D VQA due to not fully perceiving 4D information. Without incurring additional inference cost, our 4D-RGPT effectively improves MLLMs 4D perception by learning from 4D perception model via novel distillation framework, P4D. Additionally, we introduce proper benchmark, R4D-Bench, for this domain, contributing to region-level 4D VQA. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach on both non-region-level and region-level 4D VQA. 8.

            "title": "Appendix",
            "content": "The appendix is organized as follows: In Sec. A1, we provide implementation and training details for P4D and 4D-RGPT, including model architecture, training data, computational resources, and loss functions. In Sec. A2, we provide the detailed design of R4DBench, including the nine question categories and dataset curation process. In Sec. A3, we provide additional experimental results, including results with other NVILA variants, analysis of temporal perception capabilities, training data mixture, more qualitative results, and visualizations. A1. Additional Details A1.1. Model Architecture MLLM. As mentioned in Sec. 6.1, we use NVILALite-8B [36] as our base MLLM in the main experiments. NVILA is unified open-sourced MLLM family that tackles both image and video understanding. Considering the tradeoff between performance and inference efficiency, there are two groups of NVILA variants, e.g., NVILA (Base) and NVILA-Lite, where the latter is more efficient. For example, NVILA-Lite uses 3 3 downsampling kernel in EP while NVILA (Base) uses 2 2. We select NVILA-Lite as our base MLLM due to its competitive performance and higher efficiency. For all NVILA variants, we use their open-sourced weights from HuggingFace [79]. Specifically, we use the following checkpoints: Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-Lite-8B ; Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-Lite-15B ; For vision the use EV, they specifically siglip-so400m-patch14-384 . For the multimodal projector EP, they use 2-layer MLP with hidden dimension of 4,608. encoder [76], (tower) SigLIP 4D Perception Model. As mentioned in Sec. 6.1, we use L4P [36] as our 4D perception model. 40layer ViT-based video encoder from VideoMAEv2 [80] is adopted for E4D, and DPT [81] is adopted for Each D𝑚 has the each D𝑚 where 𝑚 ℳ. same architecture but different output channels depending on the target modality. As mentioned Figure A1 An example from VSTI-Bench [18] training data. The corresponding conversation is as follows: (1) User: These are frames of video. Approximately how far (in meters) did the camera move between frame 14 and frame 20 of 32? Please answer the question using single word or phrase.; (2) GPT : 1.6. in Sec. 3, the output channels are 1, 2, 1, 6 for the depth, flow, motion, camray, respectively. 4D-RGPT. In 4D-RGPT, we design lightweight 4D perception decoder D4DP to efficiently extract 4D perceptual latent from LLMs hidden states. It is 3-layer MLP with hidden dimension of 2,560. We use GELU [82] as the activation function between each layer. For initialization, we use Xavier initialization [83] for all weights and zeros for all biases. Additionally, 4D-RGPT employs Temporal Positional Encoding (TPE) to enhance the temporal understanding of the model. For TPE (Eq. (5)), we use 𝑇 = 10, 000. A1.2. Data Mixture We provide more details about the training data mixture used in our training. VSTI-Bench [18] is new dataset built upon VSIBench [84]. While VSI-Bench focuses on the spatial understanding of static 3D scenes, VSTI-Bench further investigates the spatial-temporal understanding of how spatial relations evolve over time. We use only the training set of VSTI-Bench and do not use the VSIBench. The videos are sourced from ScanNet [85] and ScanNet++ [86]. The training set contains roughly 1.2k unique videos and 130k QA pairs. training sample is shown in Fig. A1. Wolf [67] is large-scale video captioning dataset with high-quality captions generated by VLMs. Wolf provides detailed captions across three domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics. We use the NuScenes [87] portion of Wolf, i.e., the autonomous driving domain. We use Llama-3.1-70BInstruct [4] with the template-based text prompts to generate question-answer pairs based on these captions, creating conversational data suitable for 4D VQA training. The training set contains roughly 5k unique videos and 15k QA pairs. training sample is shown in Fig. A2. 10 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Figure A2 An example from Wolf [67] training data. The corresponding conversation is as follows: (1) User: What traffic participants are around the ego-centric vehicle in the video?

Figure A3 An example from RoboFAC [66] training data. The corresponding conversation is as follows: (1) User: From the video, what task is the robot engaged in?; (2) GPT : Put the fork in the cup and put them in the microwave.. RoboFAC [66] is large-scale dataset for semantic understanding of robotic arm videos, including training split with simulated robotic arm videos involving various actions. We adopt it into our training data mixture due to its stable camera views with limited background variations but rich robotic arm movements. It contains roughly 10k unique videos and 65k conversations. training sample is shown in Fig. A3. SAT [24] is an image-based VQA dataset. Though it is image-based, we consider it helpful for 4D VQA training due to its relevance on dynamic scene understanding across images. The training set contains roughly 190k unique simulated images and 170k QA pairs. training sample is shown in Fig. A4. A1.3. Training Details Our training starts from the pre-trained NVILA weights with an initial learning rate of 1e5. We use cosine learning rate scheduler with warmup ratio of 0.03. We train on multi-node cluster comprising 8 nodes. Each node has NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs and an AMD EPYC 7J13 64-Core Processor CPU. The total batch size is 1,024. We train for 5 epochs over approximately 12 hours. Losses. As mentioned in Sec. 4.2, we train our model with both SFT loss ℒSFT and P4D loss, i.e., latent (b) Second frame. (a) First frame.

The corresponding conversation is as follows: (1) User: Were any of the objects in the initial frame that you can still see in the second frame moved from their original positions?

Specifically, our total loss is ℒ = ℒSFT + 𝛼ℒLD + 𝛽ℒED, (A8) where 𝛼 and 𝛽 are hyperparameters to balance the three loss terms. We set 𝛼 = 0.5 and 𝛽 = 0.1. In Eq. 6, we set ΔLD to be the Smooth-L1 distance function. In Eq. 7, we set each Δ𝑚 to be the SmoothL1 distance function and 𝜆𝑚 to be 1.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05 for 𝑚 {depth, flow, motion, camray}, respectively. A2. R4D-Bench We provide more details about R4D-Bench, including the 9 question categories (Sec. A2.2) and dataset curation process (Sec. A2.1). A2.1. Dataset Curation To construct R4D-Bench, we develop hybrid automated and human-in-the-loop process that converts existing non-region-based 4D VQA benchmarks into region-based format. Recall Sec. 5 and Fig. 3, our curation process consists of the following stages. (a) Keyord Extraction. Given question 𝑄 and the first frame 𝐼 (1) of video, we first identify the objects mentioned in 𝑄. We employ Qwen2.5-VL32B-Instruct [35] to parse the question and extract object references. The model is given the following system prompt. Task: You will receive (1) an RGB image (the first frame of video) and (2) natural-language 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation marked regions. Task: You will receive (1) an RGB image with labeled objects (a frame from video) and (2) naturallanguage question. Instructions: Identify which labeled objects the question refers to Replace object mentions with tokens: <obj_1>, <obj_2>, etc. If no objects match, return the original question with empty obj_classes Output Format: End your answer with ### Final Answer: followed by JSON: { } \"question\": \"...\", \"obj_classes\": [\"id:class_name\", ...] Examples: Q: What is the color of the car? (car labeled as 1:car) A: { } \"question\": \"What is the color of <obj_1>?\", \"obj_classes\": [\"1:car\"] Q: What is the color of the cars? (two cars: 1:car, 2:car) A: { } \"question\": \"What is the color of <obj_1> and <obj_2>?\", \"obj_classes\": [\"1:car\", \"2:car\"] Q: What is the color of the car? (no car labeled) A: { } \"question\": \"What is the color of the car?\", \"obj_classes\": [] (e) Verification. We manually verify all converted questions to ensure quality. We use Label Studio [89] to build simple interface where human annotators can review each QA pair along with the video and the detected regions. Questions where the grounding fails, i.e., no objects detected or object misalignment, are fixed by annotators. If question cannot be fixed, it is filtered out. We trim down the input video if the object appears later in the video instead of the first frame. We exclude VQA sample where the object of 12 Figure A5 An example of SoM visual input in R4D-Bench. We apply SoM [59] on 𝐼 (1) to generate intermediate region-based visual inputs. The corresponding input 𝑄 is At 9.00 sec, what is the positional relationship of the green truck model relative to the teddy bear? question about objects in the image. Instructions: Identify the object(s) mentioned in the question and wrap them with angle brackets <>. Do not change any other part of the text. If no object matches, return the original question. Example: Input: What is the teacher right hand holding? Output: What is the <teacher> right hand holding? If the segmentation (b) Detect & Segment. masks of the identified objects are annotated in the original source, e.g., DAVIS [88, 70], we skip this stage. Otherwise, we extract the 2D bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each identified object using combination of GroundingDINO [68] and SAM2 [69]. Specifically, we use GrondingDINO ( IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base from HuggingFace) to detect objects based on the extracted object classes from (a). We set both detection and text thresholds to 0.25. The detected bounding boxes are then refined using SAM2 ( sam2.1_hiera_large ) to obtain refined segmentation masks. (c) Set of Marks. We leverage Set-of-Mark (SoM) [59] to generate an intermediate region-based visual, serving as bridge to convert non-region-based inputs into our final region-based format. We overlay numbered markers on the detected objects in 𝐼 (1), creating an annotated image where each object is labeled with unique ID and its class name, e.g., 0:cat, 1:table. An example image is shown in Fig. A5. (d) Matching. We feed the annotated image from (c) and 𝑄 into Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct with the following prompt to match the objects in 𝑄 to the 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation interest in 𝑄 is too ambiguous to ground clearly for our human annotators. The final R4D-Bench contains 1,517 region-based QA pairs. A2.2. Question Categories R4D-Bench contains 9 question categories covering both static and dynamic aspects of 4D understanding. Of the 9 categories, 4 of them are sourced from VLM4D [23] and the other 5 are sourced from STIBench [22]. For each category, we provide its defintiion below. We also attach several video examples in the supplementary folder under r4d_examples/ . For (T), Rotational the Translational ( ), Counting (C ), and False Positive ( FP) questions, we follow the definitions in VLM4D [23]. We downloaded the dataset from their official source on HuggingFace, i.e., shijiezhou/VLM4D . However, as of the time of writing, they do not provide the list of QA pairs for each category. Therefore, we leverage Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct [35] and human annotators to classify each QA pair into the 4 categories. Of the region-based QA pairs in R4D-Bench obtained from VLM4D, the distribution across different categories is as follows: Translational: 61.3% Rotational: 10.2% Counting: 15.4% False Positive: 13.1% In comparison, the official VLM4D benchmark has the following distribution: Translational: 55% Rotational: 19% Counting: 17% False Positive: 9% Our categorization results are largely consistent with the official distribution with slight difference. For the 3D Video Grounding (VG ), Spatial Relationship (SR ), Dimension Measurement (DM ), Displacement & Path Length ( DP), and Speed & Acceleration (SA) questions, we follow the definition of STI-Bench [22]. We downloaded the dataset from their official source on HuggingFace, i.e., MINT-SJTU/STI-Bench . We note that the original STI-Bench contains two additional categories, i.e., Ego-centric Orientation and Trajectory Description, where these questions focuses on the ego-centric 4D understanding from the viewpoint itself. Since R4D-Bench focuses on region-based 4D VQA, where another region of interest needs to be provided, these Figure A6 Translational questions in R4DBench. We note that the regions labeled with (*) are not provided in R4D-Bench; they are visualized for readability. questions are not applicable and removed from R4DBench. The followings are the detailed explanations for each category: Translational (T ) questions target the MLLMs capabilities to understand the linear movement of objects. They usually involve the following movementrelated diretion, such as left, right, north, south, away, towards, etc. We provide several examples of R4DBench translational questions in Fig. A6. Rotational ( R) questions, on the other hand, care about the rotational movement of objects. They usually involve the following movement-related words, such as rotate, spin, twist, turn, etc. We provide several examples of R4D-Bench rotational questions in Fig. A7. Counting (C) questions focusing on the MLLMs ability to accurately count the number of objects or occurrences of actions. We provide several examples of R4D-Bench counting questions in Fig. A8. False Positive (FP ) questions are designed to trick the MLLM. The questions will intentionally describe events that do not actually occur within the video, e.g., asking about movements when no object is mov13 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Figure A7 Rotational questions in R4D-Bench. We note that the regions labeled with (*) are not provided in R4D-Bench; they are visualized for readability. ing. We note that the original VLM4D false positive questions also ask about objects that do not exist in the video. Due to the nature of region-based 4D VQA in R4D-Bench, we do not include these types of questions since the regions cannot refer to nonexistent objects. We provide several examples of R4D-Bench false positive questions in Fig. A9. 3D Video Grounding ( VG ) questions ask MLLMs to retrive the 3D bounding box of objects. The options are formatted as JSON with dimension (size) R3, central point (coordinate) R3 and orientation R3, (i.e., yawn, pitch, and roll) or camera heading R1. We provide an example in Fig. A10. As shown in the example, the MLLM needs to be fairly precise to answer these questions correctly, as the differences between options can be quite small. Spatial Relationship (SR ) questions assess the 3D spatial relationship between selected objects or the camera. The options usually involve relative positioning terms, such as left, right, front, back, up, down, etc. We provide an example of R4D-Bench spatial relation questions in Fig. A11. Dimension Measurement ( DM ) questions care about the physical measurements of objects, such as size and distance. They usually require MLLMs to Figure A8 Counting questions in R4D-Bench.

We note that the regions labeled with (*) are not provided in R4D-Bench; they are visualized for readability. Fig. A12. Displacement & Path Length (DP ) questions measures the travel distance of objects. They often involve MLLMs to track motion across selected frames. We provide an example of R4D-Bench displacement and path length questions in Fig. A13. Speed & Acceleration ( SA ) questions estimate the motion dynamics of objects. The MLLM needs to consider both the displacement and time intervals to answer them correctly. We provide an example of R4D-Bench speed and acceleration questions in Fig. A14. A3. Additional Results More NVILA variants. In Tab. A1 and Tab. A2, we provide additional results using NVILA-Lite-15B as the base MLLM on non-region-based 4D VQA and R4D-Bench, respectively. We observe consistent performance improvements across various benchmarks. Temporal Perception. As discussed in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 6.3, we observe that MLLMs tend to struggle with temporal perception. To demonstrate such deficiency, we conduct toy experiment. As shown in Fig. A15, we curate TimeBench, simple set of VQA 15 4D-RGPT: Toward Region-level 4D Understanding via Perceptual Distillation Table A1 Evaluation on non-region-level 3D / 4D benchmarks.

All videos are acquired from the STI-Bench [22] and VLM4D [23]. We note that these two benchmarks have 4 different frame rates, ranging from 10 to 30, as shown in Tab. 1. This makes it even more challenging for MLLMs to infer time duration. To avoid ambiguity in answers, we provide 4 extra options for each question, ranging from 0.25 to 4 of the actual time duration. Table A3 Ablation studies on explicit temporal cues. We experiment without and with different choices of explicit time cues. For simplicity, we use the same abbreviations as Tab. 4.

A3 show that without cues, MLLMs struggle to know how much time has passed in the input frames. The baselines are naively guessing the answers, resulting in an accuracy close to random guessing (20%). This problem is furFigure A15 TimeBench VQA. We curate toy benchmark to evaluate MLLMs temporal perception. We note that the (𝑀 ) indicates the multiplier between the wrong option and the correct one. They are not provided in the actual question but are shown here for clarity. ther exaggerated by the inconsistency that different sources of training data and evaluation benchmarks have different frame rates. We observe that both P4D+mark and P4D+prompt can greatly improve the performance on TimeBench, which is expected since they provide explicit temporal cues. However, they require additional data preprocessing and distract MLLMs from the main visual and textual content. This toy experiment inspires us to develop methods that can provide temporal cues without modifying the input data, i.e., our TPE. Training Data Mixture. We conduct an ablation study on the training data mixture for 4D-RGPT. We incrementally add different datasets to analyze their contributions. In Tab. A4, we observe that compared to the Zero-shot baseline, adding the training data from VSTI-Bench [18], Wolf [67], or RoboFAC [66] improves the performance on both non-region-based (STI-Bench) and region-based 4D VQA (R4D-Bench). Though SAT [24] is an image-based VQA dataset, adding it also brings moderate performance gains, i.e., +0.6% on STI-Bench and +0.4% on R4D-Bench. Table A4 Incremental training data mixture. We incrementally add different datasets to analyze their contributions to 4D-RGPT. For simplicity, we use the same abbreviations as Tab. 4 and the following for each dataset: VSTI-Bench [18] (V); Wolf [67] (W); RoboFAC [66] (R); and SAT [24] (S).

In Fig. A20, we provide additional visualizations of the 4D-RGPT explicit signals ^𝑃𝑚 at different training steps. In earlier steps, we observe inaccurate predictions with grid-like structures. We hypothesize that this is due to the tokenization process in hidden states of the LLM transformer, i.e., 𝐹hidden. However, as training proceeds, the grid-like structures gradually diminish, leading to smoother and more reasonable predictions. We demonstrate that our 4D-RGPT can effectively learn to extract explicit 4D perceptual signals through the training of P4D.
