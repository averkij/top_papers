            "content": "2 Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from conversational tools into general-purpose agents capable of acting on behalf of users. Among the emerging agentic capabilities, Computer Use Agents (CUAs) that can perceive and take actions on the users computer stand out for their immediate potential (Anthropic, 2024; DeepMind, 2025; OpenAI, 2025c). They can navigate websites, fill forms, retrieve information, and generally improve productivity. capable CUA can reduce tedious multi-step tasks to single naturallanguage instruction, paving the way for ubiquitous personal digital assistants. However, the transition from chat to agency is stifled by data bottleneck. Training CUA model requires human-computer interaction data that reflects how humans plan and execute tasks on computer where to click, how to interpret visual state, how to recover from errors, and how to accomplish goals using noisy and ever-changing GUIs. While the internet provides near-infinite corpus of text training data for chat LLMs, there is no comparable data for CUA. Collecting such data with human annotators can be prohibitively expensive and slow. Synthetic data generation presents an interesting alternative, but presents its own challenges due to the lack of strong pre-existing CUA models, and programmatic alternatives are brittle in the face of ambiguities and dynamic nature of the open web. To bridge this gap, we introduce FaraGen, scalable synthetic data generation engine for CUA, designed specifically for web-based tasks. It employs collaborative multi-agent architecture that simulates the full lifecycle of digital workflows. FaraGen orchestrates three specialized components to simultaneously maximize the quality, quantity, and diversity of generated trajectories: Task Proposal: Analyzes diverse, live website to produce realistic, human-relevant tasks. Task Solving: Employs agents to collaboratively attempt the proposed tasks, generating broad collection of candidate trajectories. user simulator agent provides feedback or follow-up tasks to increase trajectory complexity and realism. Trajectory Verification: Serves as an automated quality assurance layer. We use LLM verifiers to validate trajectory outcomes against the original intent, filtering out hallucinations or execution errors to ensure high data fidelity. This closed-loop system allows FaraGen to generate verified web trajectories for roughly $1 per completed task, enabling large-scale dataset creation at cost previously infeasible for CUA research. Our resulting data covers wide range of modern website layouts, realistic user intents, dynamic content, and multi-turn reasoning all essential ingredients for robust agentic behavior."

            "content": "Fara-7B breaks ground on new Pareto frontier (see Figure 1), showing that high-quality synthetic data can unlock agentic capabilities in even small models. Fara-7B: small native CUA model. We use FaraGen to generate dataset of 145K trajectories, spanning multiple task segments like shopping, searching for information, and making reservations. Using this data, we train compact CUA model specialized for web-based computer use, Fara-7B. The web as it stands today is optimized for human consumption, and we believe navigating it as humans do will lead to the best results. As result, Fara-7B adopts pixel-in, action-out\" formulation: it perceives the computer screen directly through raw screenshots, formulates intermediate reasoning steps, and predicts atomic actions at low-level interface (clicks, scrolls, keystrokes). This avoids dependence on brittle DOM parsing, and is consistent with recent findings that vision-centric CUAs exhibit stronger cross-site generalization (Yutori, 2025). We evaluate Fara-7B across existing web-based CUA benchmarks as well as new benchmark we introduce, WebTailBench, which is designed to cover real-world web tasks often under-represented in current metrics. As illustrated in Figure 1, Fara-7B not only achieves state of the art results for model of its size, but is also competitive with much larger frontier models. Fara-7B CUA model 3 Figure 2: FaraGen - breakdown of our various Task Proposal workflows, emphasizing the need for seed URLs that reflect real human users web needs. We find FaraGen to be capable of generating diverse trajectories with high throughput and reliability. This strong performance coupled with its small size unlocks distinct deployment advantages for CUA technology: On-Device Execution: Fara-7Bs small footprint allows for local inference, significantly reducing latency and enhancing privacy by keeping user data locally on-device. Cost Efficiency: The model offers excellent performance-to-cost tradeoff, averaging just few cents per task. It is more cost-effective than UI-TARS despite similar size due to lower token utilization, and substantially cheaper compared to systems based on frontier models like GPT-5. Contributions. In summary, our primary contributions are: FaraGen. scalable synthetic data engine that breaks the CUA data scarcity barrier. By automating task proposal, solving, and verification, FaraGen can generate verified successful trajectories at roughly $1 per task. Fara-7B. compact (7B), CUA model. We demonstrate that high-quality synthetic data enables small models to achieve strong results, suggesting the viability of on-device agency. It is available on Huggingface and Azure Foundry. WebTailBench. new benchmark addressing critical gaps in existing task sets. WebTailBench targets under-represented real-world scenarios on live websites to provide robust standard for measuring agent generalization."

            "content": "Unlike LLMs which enjoy an abundance of web data for training, key bottleneck in building CUA models is lack of high-quality interaction data demonstrating how users complete tasks on computer. Collecting such data with human annotators is very expensive and hard to scale as single CUA task can involve dozens of steps, most of which might require human annotation and explanation. FaraGen avoids manual annotation and instead relies on scalable synthetic data sourced from real websites and custom task prompts. The pipeline involves three main stages: Task Proposal to generate realistic tasks that distributionally match Fara-7B CUA model 4 Figure 3: FaraGen - Distributional differences between two publicly available sources of seed URLs: Tranco and Clueweb22. We find that Clueweb22 is more valuable source of task data because it contains lower fraction of corporate landing pages which tend to have narrower scope of actionable tasks achievable on those pages. what users would employ CUA for, Task Solving which extends the Magentic-One and Magentic-UI agents (Fourney et al., 2024; Mozannar et al., 2025) to solve tasks, and Task Verification to filter which candidate trajectories successfully completed the task."

            "title": "2.1 Task Proposal",
            "content": "We generate broad set of synthetic tasks with the primary objective of reflecting the distribution of tasks users commonly perform on the web, targeting two broad categories: information seeking questions (e.g., looking up product specifications, finding event details) and actionable tasks (e.g., online purchasing, booking reservations, applying for jobs). We employ three different strategies for generating these synthetic tasks. Targeted URL Task Proposal. To ensure coverage and diversity, the majority of our tasks are seeded by web index of public URLs classified into various categories, such as e-commerce, entertainment, or forums, as shown in Figure 3. Using additional proprietary classifiers, we further select URL sub-categories. For instance, restaurants or movies, which fall under the Entertainment category. Two URL sources that we utilize are ClueWeb22 (Overwijk et al., 2022) and Tranco (Le Pochat et al., 2019). Not all corpora of web URLs are created equal, and we note that ClueWeb22 (Overwijk et al., 2022) has more coverage of high quality websites compared to Tranco (Le Pochat et al., 2019), so we primarily leverage ClueWeb22. Using the URL classifications, we select URLs in particular categories to generate tasks targeted at specific skills we want Fara-7B to have. For example, we can generate realistic user task like book two tickets to see Wicked: For Good at AMC Union Square, NYC. from URL like https://www.fandango.com/ wicked-for-good-2025-238985/movie-overview classified as movies. As shown in Figure 2 (left), we employ multiple iterations of LLM calls to refine raw URL into self-contained and verifiable task, similar to AgentInstruct (Mitra et al., 2024). After identifying high-value URL, we summarize the primary intents that users landing on the page would likely have. We then prompt an LLM to generate and rank several candidate tasks until ultimately selecting those that are: 1) achievable without requiring logins or bypassing paywalls; 2) unambiguous and fully-specified; 3) useful in real scenarios; and 4) automatically verifiable. During development, we found that not enforcing these criteria resulted in up to 29% of proposed tasks being un-verifiable or un-achievable. Examples include: asking to make phone call, investing in cryptocurrencies, applying for credit card, booking flights without destinations, or reading blogs without any goal or question asked. Some segments of URLs that we directly target include: shopping (including single items Fara-7B CUA model Figure 4: FaraGen - The Task Solving pipeline is built on top of Magentic-One multi-agent framework, with an orchestrator agent that plans and directs Websurfer agent that can take broswer actions. set of verifiers agents identifies successfully solved trajectories for use in training Fara-7B. and lists of items), travel (including flights, hotels, rental cars), booking restaurant reservations, booking event tickets, planning activities/itineraries, booking appointments, finding real estate, and applying to jobs. Most of these tasks involve single concept or skill, so we furthermore create compositional tasks involving multiple websites and steps. For instance, finding recipe and then buying its ingredients, or comparing the price of an item across two retailers. Finally, we include some subjective tasks like Whats the best new dive bar in Williamsburg?. In all, about 28% of our tasks used in training are sourced from targeted URLs. We are releasing subset of 609 tasks as benchmark, called WebTailBench, specifically focusing on 11 task segments underrepresented or missing in existing benchmarks. We provide more details in Section 4. Agentic URL Exploration. The complementary strategy to targeting specific URLs and domains is to take uniform samples of URLs from the web as seeds. We generate tasks from random URLs by instantiating multi-modal LLM agent to traverse the website, consuming both screenshots and accessibility trees (Pahuja et al., 2025). Shown in Figure 2 (middle), we sample URL, navigate to it, and have the agent generate an initial query based on the webpage. The agent attempts to complete the task by iteratively taking actions. At each step, the agent refines the task based on what has been done and the current state of the page. Then, it predicts the next action required to complete the updated task. This iterative refinement gradually improves the task as the agent explores the website and gathers more information about what can be accomplished. Approximately 67% of our training tasks are derived from agent-driven explorations of randomly sampled websites. However, it is worth noting that the complexity of these tasks is often lower than the segmenttargeted ones, as indicated by the number of steps required to solve them in Table 2. This highlights the need for better automatic creation of complex tasks. Examplar Task Proposal. As in Figure 2 (right), our third strategy for proposing tasks is to expand bank of existing seed tasks into different related tasks. For instance, if given task is to buy an item or book flight, we use an LLM to break it down into template of its primary intent, entities, and arguments, vary those fields, and then rewrite the template into natural language task to, e.g., buy different items with varying constraints on different retailer, or book different flight with other parameters on different airline."

            "content": "Once synthetic tasks are generated, multi-agent system built on Magentic-One (Fourney et al., 2024) attempts to solve them to generate demonstrations for supervised fine-tuning (Figure 4). The multi-agent system uses an Orchestrator agent to plan and direct WebSurfer agent that takes browser actions and reports back results.

UserSimulator agent if user input is required, allowing for multi-turn task completion. trajectory is given by the task and full sequence of observations, actions, and thoughts from these agents. Critical Points. Throughout our task solving process, we constantly monitor for and avoid crossing critical points of the task which affect the state of the world without user confirmation. Training the model to avoid critical points reduces the chance of costly mistakes by having the model stop at critical points and only proceed with further user instruction. critical point is any binding transaction or agreement that would require the users permission to: Use personal or sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, name, email, address, payment information) in order to complete transaction (e.g., purchase, reservation). Communicate in way that human would be expected to do (e.g., all, email, apply to job). Commit an action that is difficult to reverse. For example, if the task is to book flight, critical point would be once the agent has found the flight but before anything is purchased/checked out. We strictly enforce that we never crosses critical point. One limitation, however, is that there is hence no training data of behaviors beyond these points, and so Fara-7B may not behave as expected. The UserSimulator when activated, allows the data generation pipeline to resume from critical point by simulating what human would reply at the critical point e.g., providing approval or personal information. Figure 4 shows our iterative task solving process with the Orchestrator and WebSurfer. Given task, the Orchestrator first creates plan that it thinks the WebSurfer should take to complete the task and lists some important information about the task. Based on this plan, the Orchestrator gives an instruction to the WebSurfer about what to do first. The WebSurfer takes this instruction and an observation from the browser (screenshot and accessibility tree), and outputs thoughts and specific action to take. After executing the action, the WebSurfer reports the observation, reasoning, and action back to the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator then checks the response from the WebSurfer, checks the progress against the plan, and can issue the next instruction to the WebSurfer, decide to stop, or re-plan. This loop of the Orchestrator directing the WebSurfer and the WebSurfer taking actions continues until we reach stopping point. We detail the designs of these agents in the following sections."

At the very beginning of solving, the Orchestrator outlines plan that it thinks the WebSurfer should take. The Orchestrator then gives instructions for each step and supervises every action the WebSurfer takes by maintaining ledger of diagnostic fields as shown in Table 1. The Orchestrator predicts values for each fields based on the screenshots before and after the WebSurfer has executed its action as well as the action itself. The next_steps field becomes the next instruction given to the WebSurfer.

            "title": "Finding",
            "content": "Despite our sophisticated multi-agent solving system, difficult tasks (often characterized by longer trajectories) require more careful quality controls because they present subtle failures modes like looping that are not as prominent with simpler tasks. The most frequent WebSurfer failure mode is getting stuck in loops of repeated actions, which we address with two separate flags. At coarse-grained level, the orchestrator classifies is_in_loop if multiple unsuccessful attempts are made at doing the same thing. At fine-grained level, the last_action_successful determines if the difference between the pre-action and post-action screenshots is adequately explained by the issued action. To illustrate the importance of these diagnostics, consider that up to 25% of completed trajectories in the Shopping List (3 - 7 items) dataset in Table 2 are removed from training because of being is_in_loop consecutively more than three times, whereas shorter single-item shopping tasks are only looping 7.5% of the time. The Orchestrator decides what to do based on the values in the ledger, such as re-planning if in loop, retrying if the last action was not successful, or stopping if at critical point or the task is complete. Stopping Criteria. Both the Orchestrator and WebSurfer can decide to stop at any time, e.g., if one agent believes the task is complete or critical point is reached. This presents possible logical conflict, especially in light of hard constraints like critical points. For instance, the WebSurfer can report that it is done with the task, but the Orchestrator can overrule that decision and force the WebSurfer to continue if the task is not satisfied. The complete logic table of these decisions is outlined in Table 3. The first column is the strongest authority signal (Critical Point), which overrules all other flags, whereas the WebSurfer deciding to stop is the weakest signal and can be overruled. When the WebSurfer is forced to stop, instead of programmatically issuing stop action, we instead choose to disable all other actions, so that the WebSurfer will naturally reason about why it is forced to stop. This understanding helps Fara-7B generalize to unseen scenarios involving Critical Points. Task Targets. Upon the completion of task, the final function of the orchestrator is to go back into the history and identify the URL of any targets that were the object of the task (e.g., the URL of an item to be purchased). This identification step helps the verifiers determine whether the target was in fact the correct target. User Simulator. Our data generation pipeline includes an optional UserSimulator to generate multi-turn conversations with an agent acting as user.

Columns are ordered by precedence (left to right). point or due to task completion, the UserSimulator can provide response to the critical point or generate follow-up task that builds on the original task, as shown in Figure 4. The follow-up task generation follows similar guidelines to our Task Proposal pipeline: it has to be specific, useful, and achievable, in addition to having natural relationship to the original task. We sample and rank up to four follow-up tasks. Only small fraction of our training trajectories were treated with multi-turn extensions, as this is an active area of exploration. Task Solving Infrastructure. Each task-solving session runs in an isolated process that encapsulates headless Playwright instance. These sessions are executed in parallel as map operation from tasks to trajectories on Azure Machine Learning, within job parameterized by the number of compute nodes and the number of processes per node. For instance, we could achieve throughput of 600 completed trajectories per hour on 40 nodes running 4 browsers each, translating to about 3.75 trajectories per process per hour if GPT-4o is the WebSurfer and o4-mini is the Orchestrator. Secondly, many websites in segments like flights and shopping are constantly updating their websites, so we needed way to manage browser sessions more consistently. As shown in Table 2, using Browserbase1 improves successful trajectory yield by more than 3x (9% to 35% for shopping, and 3% to 11% for flights) over runs without Browserbase. These gains in yield are additive to other techniques, like domain-specific instructions from Section 2.1, which by itself boosted Hotel booking yields by 10% absolute."

            "title": "2.2.2 WebSurfer",
            "content": "The primary responsibility of the WebSurfer is to interact directly with the browser via Playwright2 actions, like click and type. However, some actions imbue more powerful logical capabilities, like Memorize, which lets the WebSurfer record piece of information that it can keep in its context for later similar to (Bonatti et al., 2024). The presence of this action helps reduce hallucinations, e.g., about important information across websites from the history that are no longer visible. The action space of the WebSurfer is largely the same as Fara-7B, discussed later in Table 7, except for few differences. During Task Solving, we distinguished two separate stopping actions: one for answering question and one for completing task. Additionally, the action space is dynamic, for instance, if the viewport is at the top of the page, we do not allow the websurfer to scroll_up action. WebSurfer Context Engineering. The WebSurfer is SoM Agent (Abuelsaad et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023), meaning it relies on having the accessibility tree of webpages. The observation from the webpage that the WebSurfer takes in is the accessibility tree and SoM screenshot with the bounding boxes of the accessibility tree elements annotated in the image. The WebSurfer also receives the full history of actions it has taken, as well as some instructions/hints as to the next steps it should take from the Orchestrator (Section 2.2.1). This design allows us to use different multimodal LLMs as the backbone model for the WebSurfer. The drawback is that accessibility trees can be under-maintained or non-existent, and riddled with hidden 1https://www.browserbase.com/ 2https://playwright.dev/ Fara-7B CUA model Modifications to Task Solving System Web Surfer Success Rate Baseline + sees full action history + Use o3 as WS + WS sees full action history + Retry on env. errors + Use browserbase + Use GPT-5 as WS o4-mini o4-mini o3 o3 o3 o3 GPT33% 37% 45% 49% 53% 55% 60% Table 4: Cumulative ablations showing the impact of various modifications to the Task Solving pipeline on WebVoyager success rate as judged by our internal Verification Pipeline. The baseline (top row) was minimal setup where WebSurfer only sees the screenshot and AxTree, and translates Orchestrators next_steps to playwright tool calls, and neither agent sees more than previous 5 actions. or non-effectual elements that distract the agent. Our careful design for the Orchestrator is meant to help mitigate this and ensure the WebSurfer is making progress. Based on these inputs, the WebSurfer outputs description of the state of the webpage, reasoning text about the status of the trajectory and what the right action should be, and the next action represented as tool call. The predicted action is then executed in the browser environment. Finally, the WebSurfer reports its outputs as well as the screenshots before and after the action execution back to the Orchestrator. This marks the end of the step for the WebSurfer and it awaits the next instruction from the Orchestrator. Optimizing Task Solving for Success Rate. While WebSurfer and Orchestrator are built on Magentic-One, the original framework was not designed for large-scale data harvesting. To address this, we introduce targeted refinements to maximize success rates when curating trajectories for training. These improvements focus on enhancing robustness against web browsing errors and timeouts, and improved management of action history across both components. For instance, of the functional improvements measured in Table 4, leveraging stronger models for WebSurfer such as o3 and GPT-5 accounted for about half the gains over the baseline, whereas improved context construction and fault tolerance accounted for the remainder."

However, these verifiers must be generic enough to handle wide variety of task profiles: information seeking tasks primarily require verification of the output answer and its supported evidence, whereas action-oriented tasks require in-depth evaluation of the process the model took to achieve its goal. Often, gold reference answers exist for neither of these scenarios. We use combination of three complementary verifiers to make these judgments. Each verifier is an LLM judge that we prompt in various ways to evaluate trajectories from different perspectives."

The Rubric Verifier generates rubric for each task and judges the corresponding trajectory against the rubric, crediting points for partial completion of various sub-goals. Each rubric is expressed list of criteria that trajectory would likely need to meet in order to be successful. Given task and generated trajectory, this verifier first predicts the individual criteria in the rubric including how many points each is worth, and how many the model earned toward that sub-goal. We then calculate rubric score as the proportion of total points in the rubric that are satisfied. To get the final judgement from this verifier, we set threshold of 0.8 and mark trajectories with rubric scores above the threshold as successful. Multimodal Verifier. This verifier inspects the screenshots and final response of the trajectory to check whether the task was successfully completed. Inspired by Xue et al. (2025), our verifier first selects the most relevant screenshots from the trajectory based on the task ranked by how informative they are of the whether criteria of the task were met. Then, given these salient screenshots along with the final response of the trajectory, the verifier judges: 1) whether the final response is fully consistent with the evidence shown in the screenshots and 2) whether the content in the screenshots appear to satisfy the task. Our Multimodal Verifier is especially important for combating hallucinations. For instance, when asked what ingredients and how many calories are in particular smoothie recipe, this verifier will catch hallucinations of caloric content or ingredient quantities that arent supported by the underlying screenshot. Role of Verifiers in Task Solving. Our task verification system must be generic enough to handle the nuances of any web task. In Table 2, we show variety of selected sub-datasets collected from the task solving system to highlight the significant variance in the verifier success rate across task segments. For instance, shopping for one item requires fewer steps and has higher success rate than shopping for 3 or more items. Importantly, there is an inverse correlation between the length of candidate trajectories from the solving pipeline, and the success rate, showing that even with sophisticated multi-agent solving system that deliberately checks for task satisfaction at every step, more sophisticated quality control verifiers are still required. We assess the average quality of our verifications by measuring the agreement between our verifier predictions and human judgments. We find 83.3% agreement, with false positive rate of 16.7% and false negative rate of 18.4%."

Listed in Table 5, after filtering with our verifiers and cleaning, we have total of 145K trajectories with 1 million steps across them. These trajectories visit 70K unique domains. We see that the average number of unique domains per trajectory is approximately 0.5, which illustrates the diversity of our data since roughly half of our trajectories visit websites not found elsewhere in the data. The distribution of trajectory lengths is long-tailed and the trajectories range from 3 to 84 steps. As discussed in Section 2.3, there is an inverse correlation between trajectory length and success rate. Taking trajectory length rough proxy for task difficulty (Xue et al., 2025) suggests that our data cover breadth of task difficulties.

These trajectories have an average of approximately 19 steps and are both solved and verified using o4-mini as the backbone model for all components. To aim for somewhat conservative estimate, we use reasoning model as these models output more tokens. We then calculate the average cost per trajectory when using different models.3 Table 6 shows that with expensive models like o3 and GPT-5, we are able to generate and verify trajectories for roughly $1 per trajectory. While the cost per trajectory may be reasonable for data generation, it is likely prohibitively expensive to deploy such as system at scale. This result in tandem with the promising cost-accuracy trade-off of Fara-7B (Figure 1) shows that our approach can be cost-effective end-to-end."

Observation. common approach for building web agents it to utilize extra scaffolding around the environment to make predicting grounded actions easier, particularly accessibility trees (Abuelsaad et al., 2024; GLM-V, 2025; He et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023). However, this can be highly error-prone and difficult to generalize since the implementation of UI elements and websites can vary widely (Yutori, 2025). While they are used to collect training data, Fara-7B avoids accessibility trees at runtime, taking in only screenshot and simple browser metadata, such as the current URL, as the observation."

Despite discarding this scaffolding, it reliably predicts grounded actions by directly outputting click coordinates (see Table 13). Thoughts and Action. Based on the input observation, the model first outputs thoughts that describes useful information such as the content of the webpage or the status of the trajectory, as well as what action needs to be taken next. Then, conditioned on the thoughts, the model outputs an action represented as tool call. The available actions for Fara-7B are listed in Table 7. These include standard computer-use actions (e.g., clicking, typing) as well as browser-specific actions such as visiting specific URL.

It operates directly on pixel input and outputs atomic actions such as clicking, typing or scrolling. Fara can take multiple steps to accomplish task and is trained to stop and hand back control when it reaches critical points. only consumes screenshots as input, the model directly predicts the coordinates in the screenshot for any grounded actions such as clicking. We include the Memorize action from the task solving system to allow Fara-7B to store important information that may be useful later in the trajectory and then continue executing. This is especially useful when key pieces of information needed to satisfy the task are on different pages (e.g., comparing prices of an item between different retailer sites). Since Fara-7B operates on its own, without an Orchestrator to provide extra information, this capability becomes even more important. Finally, the model has Terminate action to signal the end of trajectory and hand back control to the user. The sequence of steps comprises trajectory: = (q0, {o0, r0, a0}, . . . , {oT, rT, aT}). (1) We train Fara-7B to predict the next thoughts and action given the current observation and the full history of steps: P(rt, atq0, {o0, r0, a0}, . . . , {ot1, rt1, at1}). We maintain the history as input because previous observations, thoughts, and actions provide important context for tracking progress, recognizing errors, and deciding the next steps. This formulation also supports follow-up interactions from the user. For instance, if Fara-7B finishes the initial task q0 after steps and the user follows up with another query q1, then we simply continue predicting the next steps while maintaining the full history: (2) P(rt+k, at+kq0, {o0, r0, a0}, . . . , q1, {ot+1, rt+1, at+1}, . . . , {ot+k1, rt+k1, at+k1}). (3) Since our observations consist of screenshots, which can consume thousands of tokens each, keeping the full history in the context window becomes computationally intensive. To alleviate this, we keep only the most recent observations in the history and remove earlier ones, similar to Qin et al. (2025). Based on early experiments, we set = 3, which offers reasonable trade-off between accuracy and speed and memory performance. Meanwhile, we keep all previous thoughts and actions in the history.

            "content": "To train Fara-7B, we first process our trajectory data into the format described in the previous section. We then mix this trajectory data with other auxiliary task data to complement training. Trajectory Data. To train single CUA model using data from our multi-agent pipeline, we extract screenshots, reasoning text, and actions from the WebSurfer outputs in each trajectories. We use the reasoning text and actions from each step as our thoughts and actions. Given that our WebSurfer is SoM agent, we replace the SoM element IDs in the WebSurfer actions with the center coordinates of each elements bounding box, so our model directly predicts coordinates for grounding. Since the WebSurfer bases its outputs on the instructions from the Orchestrator, the reasoning text and actions reflect useful information provided by the Orchestrator. For example, if the Orchestrator detects that the trajectory is at critical point, the WebSurfer will receive this information, provide an explanation of why it cannot continue the task based on the current screenshot that is consistent with the Orchestrators message, and issue Terminate action. Similarly, there are implicit signals of the Orchestrator-WebSurfer interaction contained in the WebSurfers steps. For instance, when the system detects that the trajectory is in loop and re-plans, the instructions to the WebSurfer change accordingly and the following steps will attempt to break out of the loop. As discussed earlier, we train single, unified model instead of multiple specialized agents because this eliminates inference-time coordination overhead. However, having our model learn from the multi-agent trajectories allows it to benefit from the multi-step reasoning patterns that they demonstrate. Auxiliary Task Data. We additionally train on data from related tasks that are complementary to agentic computer use tasks. Specifically, we take screenshots from our trajectories as well as open source data and generate prompt-response pairs for: Grounding: We identify elements in the images using accessibility trees or provided annotations (e.g., SeeClick (Cheng et al., 2024)) and generate grounding queries for them. This data serves to improve our models localization capabilities, which is fundamental sub-tasks for CUAs. Refusal Data: To teach our model safe behaviors when encountering potentially harmful tasks, we generate two types of refusal data: 1) based on trajectory screenshots, we generate harmful tasks grounded in the webpage screenshots, 2) based on example harmful tasks such as those from WildGuard (Han et al., 2024) or from WebTailBench, we generate similar harmful tasks for refusals. UI Screenshot Question Answering and Captioning: Using randomly sampled webpage screeenshots from our training data trajectories, we generate data consisting of question-answer pairs grounded in the screenshots and image captioning data. With this data, we aim to bolster our models ability to extract information from webpages and avoid hallucinations. Examples of each of each kind of task data are provided in the appendix. Our full data mixture pools together all the trajectory and related task data. We tune the mixing ratios of the data to maximize our performance on the CUA task, including upsampling some of our trajectory data. We use 1.8 million training samples total. Fara-7B CUA model 14 We use Qwen2.5-VL-7B (Qwen, 2025) as our base model and perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on top of it. For trajectory data, we treat each individual step of each trajectory as training sample, providing the history of observations and actions up to the current step as input. We adopt the grounding convention of Qwen2.5-VL and predict absolute coordinates. We use the standard cross-entropy loss and all outputs are tokens from the models vocabulary, including the coordinates. Since we keep only the most recent observations at each step, we backpropagate the loss only for actions that have corresponding observations. Data for other tasks follows the standard SFT setup. Details of our data mixture and training settings are in the appendix."

Table 8: WebTailBench examples from each segment to illustrate the level of specificity and detail. Fara-7B CUA model 15 Realism. WebTailBench offers realistic and effective way to evaluate CUA models online by using tasks taken from high-traffic webpages, reflecting actual human information needs. For example, its jobs and ticketing tasks in Table 8 better mirror real user behavior than comparable Online-Mind2Web examples, such as Search for job in Miami, Florida, in Human Resources on target. (hard) and Browse the page with event planning tips on Eventbrite (easy).. Coverage. the structure incorporates both breadth and depth with different task subcategories, large-enough number of tasks per subcategory and different levels of task complexity. For example, Online-Mind2Web includes only three tasks pertaining to flights, which limits the ability to accurately assess proficiency in flight booking. Similarly, while WebVoyager features Google Flights segment, it lacks representation from other booking platforms or airline websites, making it difficult to determine if strong performance on one site wil generalize across various flight booking channels. Objectivity. WebTailBench tasks are goal-oriented asking the model to accomplish clear and useful objectives. If task fails due to factors beyond the models control, such as sold-out bookings, full credit is given if the model reports this properly. Other benchmarks will penalize this outcome. Many existing web benchmark tasks are synthetically generated and lack clear goals, for example, Online-Mind2Web includes this task Browse Marriott Bonvoy credit cards on Marriott. In fact about 25% of Online-Mind2Web instructions simply ask to browse, find, or view, without specifying an actionable objective. In this sense, existing benchmarks assess navigational skills more prominently than goal-oriented task completion. Alignment. We notice that most public benchmark verifiers do not align well with human judgment. For example, WebVoyagers evaluation method groups all screenshots in single GPT-4o LLM call without including the models final output, making it prone to distraction. As discussed in Section 2.3, our verification system matches human assessments more closely. Refusals. Current safety refusals benchmarks do not test for realistic task scenarios that CUA can accomplish. Therefore, we manually curated 111 tasks in WebTailBench-Refusals to evaluate the ability of agents to refuse harmful tasks. The 111 tasks span seven categories of harmful tasks which are: illegal activities, deceptive tasks, high-risk domains, harassment and hate, irresponsible use of technology, misinformation and sexual content. The categories are outlined in Appendix Table 15 with examples in Table 17. Freshness. The WebTailBench tasks are designed to be valid at least through the end of November 2025, after which they may be periodically refreshed. Many segments are time sensitive with some tasks specifying exact dates, while others using relative times (e.g., \"next Tuesday). Segments like flights, hotels, and ticketing are particularly time-sensitive due to dates specified in the task statement or schedules of when certain artists are on tour or certain shows are playing. Tasks can also become outdated if, for example, restaurants close, products are discontinued, or businesses stop hiring."

All SoM agents use the same implementation to parse and visualize the set-of-marks.

This setup does not use the orchestrator, and iteratively prompts the WebSurfer to complete the task. We also compare to the open source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking (GLM-V, 2025). CUA models.

Together with GPT-4o and o4-mini as LLM-based judges, these features let us distribute tasks across machines, sample trajectories from any web agent, and rapidly evaluate those trajectories. The agentic evaluations are done on live websites that can change day-to-day, making comparisons extremely difficult. We take the following measures to produce reliable and comparable evaluations of different agents (including our model and all baselines): Browserbase. We employ Browserbase to manage browser session hosting, enabling us to run and manage browser instance reliably. Time-sensitive Tasks. Tasks in many benchmarks including WebVoyager and WebTailBench are timedependent and may go stale or become impossible. We removed approximately 48 tasks from the original WebVoyager benchmark that are impossible and can not be salvaged, while another 50 required new dates in the future to make them currently achievable. For example, the original task Search for hotel ... in Bali from Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2024 has been modified to Search for hotel ... in Bali from Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2026. Environment Error Retries. When agents attempt to complete tasks on live website, browser errors can occur when connections drop or page loading times out. To handle this, we retry the trajectory up to five times, but only when environment errors occur. Complete yet incorrect trajectories are never retried as completion means either the agent has decided to stop or the step budget has been reached. We only allow retries if the trajectory threw environment errors preventing its completion. If an environment error does occur, we start over with fresh browser session, without retaining any prior state. We apply this logic to all models. Multiple Runs. Even with the aforementioned mitigations, online web evaluation is still high variance. To better estimate true performance, we run three independent evaluations for each online benchmark and report the average, making the metrics more robust to variance between runs. In the unlikely event that some tasks could not be finished even under the retry logic, we simply count it as wrong when reporting averages. Step Budget. Each trajectory for every online benchmark is capped at maximum budget of 100 steps, after which if the model does not choose to stop it is considered wrong."

As native CUA model, Fara-7B is more cost-efficient, producing roughly one-tenth the output tokens of SoM agents backed reasoning models like o3 and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking with each benchmark. Namely, we use GPT-4o along with the official respective prompts in the LLMbased judge for WebVoyager (He et al., 2024) and Deepshop, and o4-mini as the LLM-based judge for Online-Mind2Web and WebTailBench. Comparisons of the main evaluation benchmarks are reported in Table 9. Across four web benchmarks, Fara-7B achieves better overall success rate over other 7B-scale computer-use models and compares favorably to larger SoM agents. It achieves 73.5% success on WebVoyager, outperforming both the SoM GPT-4o (65.1) and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking agents (66.8), and slightly improving over the OpenAI computer-use baseline (70.9). On Online-Mind2Web, Fara-7B attains 34.1, comparable to GPT-4o (34.6) and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking (33.9). Fara-7B also delivers strong gains on shopping-style tasks, scoring 26.2 on DeepShop versus 16.0 for GPT-4o and 11.6 for UI-TARS-1.5-7B. Notably, Fara-7B achieves score of 38.4 on WebTailBench, substantially outperforming models in its class, in addition to GPT-4o-based SoM agent (30.0) and OpenAI computer-use (25.7). Fara-7B is clearly the top-performing model at its parameter scale, and furthermore outperforms the GPT-4o-based SoM agent head-to-head. Cost Efficiency. Table 10 compares efficiency statistics across models on WebVoyager. While Fara-7B uses similar number of input tokens per task as the SoM agents (roughly 1.2 105 vs. 1.11.4 105 for GPT-4o and GPT-5), the gap is much larger for output tokens: GPT-5 often has 13k output tokens per task, whereas Fara-7B uses only about 1.1k tokens, even lower than the GPT-4o SoM agent. Based on market rate token pricing discussed in Appendix A, the average cost per task is $0.025 for Fara-7B, compared to roughly $0.30 for proprietary baselines. In terms of interaction length, Fara-7B completes tasks in 16.5 21.1 actions on average, which is comparable to GPT-4o and GPT-5, but shorter than OpenAI computer-use-preview. The more actions model takes on average to complete task, the more tokens it will expend since history tokens are typically cumulative. Overall, Fara-7B achieves solid WebVoyager accuracy while being significantly more token and cost-efficient than larger proprietary agents. Headroom Analysis. In Figure 1, we expand on our analysis of WebVoyager by computing pass@k for the three runs we already obtained for each model. We compute pass@k as whether or not model could achieve the same task with independent runs, averaged across all (3 k) combinations if < 3. Coupled with the token and cost statistics in Table 10 showing that Fara-7B takes just as many steps completing tasks as GPT-5 while expending 10x fewer output tokens, we can conclude that Fara-7B breaks ground on new pareto frontier, showing that on-device computer use agents can approach the capabilities of much larger models without expending more effort. While not representative of real system, pass@k is an important way to quantify headroom, i.e. improving Fara-7B to achieve 90% WebVoyager accuracy could involve well-known post-training techniques beyond just the supervised finetuning we did in Section 3.2. Human Evaluation. We engaged with trusted third party, Browserbase, to independently verify Fara-7B with human annotators. They used the inference harness we release in our github to generate trajectories from Fara-7B endpoints hosted on Azure Foundry for our filtered and re-refreshed WebVoyager tasks. They establish 62% accuracy of Fara-7B and other open source models. These numbers have been produced using Fara-7B CUA model 18 Figure 6: Comparing WebTailBench accuracy and cost of Fara-7B to other computer use agents (CUA). Again, while both Fara-7B and UI-TARS-1.5-7B are priced equally, Fara-7B is more adept at roughly twice the accuracy (38% vs 19.5%). the same environment, settings and with human verification of each task, making them directly comparable to each other. Note that human eval numbers for all models are less than the results obtained by GPT-4o LLM-as-a-judge from the official WebVoyager evaluation procedure reported in Table 9. These results reaffirm findings from others that the gap between auto-eval and human annotators is due to promptand model mis-alignment (Xue et al., 2025), and that further improvements in llm-as-a-judge frameworks are needed for CUA scenarios. Going forward, we are collaborating with Browserbase to host WebTailBench human evaluations to help the community build reliable and reproducible assessments for computer use agents."

We report both the macro average across subcategories and the micro average, again averaged across three independent runs. On five out of the eight single-skill subcategories, Fara-7B matches or exceeds all other baselines besides the most capable frontier-based SoM agents backed by GPT-5 or o3. Since Fara-7B is very small, we credit this achievement to the quality of our FaraGen data generation pipeline, which trained Fara-7B with relatively small set of training trajectories (as enumerated in Table 2). For instance, there are fewer than 4k flight and hotel tasks each in our entire training corpus and yet Fara-7B is within 3 points of o3 performance in both categories, showing that modest sums of high quality data can take small model long way at mastering particular skill. Some subcategories in WebTailBench have unexpectedly low results across the board, like real estate, but we believe this is due to the defensive behavior of websites in that segment against bots.

This again reinforces our thesis that modest amount of high-quality data is sufficient to elicit useful agentic behaviors. On the three subcategories of Shopping Lists, Comparison Shopping, and Compositional Tasks involving more difficult multi-step or cross-site procedures, reasoning-endowed models like GPT-5 and o3 clearly stand out, highlighting the benefits of additional thinking space for planning and executing long-horizon tasks. Still, Fara-7B is able to out-compete all other baselines besides GPT-5 and o3 on those subcategories. However, again we see that the benefits of reasoning models in terms of performance are muted by their increased cost, as shown in Table 12. SoM agents backed by GPT-5 and o3 cost more than 10x per task on average (o3 costs nearly $1!) than Fara-7B because not only are they more expensive per token, but they expend 10x as many output tokens (thinking tokens are priced as output tokens). Table 12 also shows that Fara-7B takes roughly the same amount of steps (a good proxy of latency) as UI-TARS-1.5-7B while achieving twice the accuracy (38% vs 19.5%).

In Table 13b, we breakdown the performance of Fara-7B across different segments of the grounding benchmarks. We see that Fara-7B shows strong results across the board, with excellent results for grounding text elements. This is intuitive as large portion of the interactive elements on the web are text-based, such as links and menus.

Fara-7B also benefits from step-budget scaling at inference time. Interestingly, this benefits Fara-7B and UI-TARS-1.5-7B almost equally, despite Fara-7B using only SFT while UI-TARS-1.5-7B employing extensive RL. Data. We train on progressively larger fractions of our data (1%, 10%, and 100%). Figure 7 (left) shows that even with 1% or 10% of our data, we reach non-trivial accuracies. However, the models at lower data scales see significant performance drops compared to the full data. Looking at the upward trend and significant jumps between scales, Fara-7B may benefit from further scaling up our data. Inference Steps. We measure success rate at various maximum step budgets, which we vary from 15-100 steps. We specifically compare Fara-7B to UI-TARS-1.5-7B as they share the same base model, but have undergone two distinct post-training regimes. Figure 7 (middle) shows that, while Fara-7B scores higher overall, both models benefit similarly from the increased step budgets. This holds true even on the harder Online-Mind2Web benchmark (Figure 7 (right)), where neither model significantly outpaces the other as the steps are scaled up.

            "title": "5.4 Safety - Refusals and Critical Points",
            "content": "Agents capable of operating computers present challenges distinct from chat-only models, including new avenues for user misuse, model misbehavior, unintended real-world consequences of actions, and external risks such as prompt injections or online scams. Because CUAs can take actions with tangible impact, robust safety measures are central to Fara-7Bs design. Following OpenAIs Operator (OpenAI, 2025c), we focus on three different risk scenarios: Harmful Tasks: The user requests the model to perform harmful task. Example: purchase illegal drugs online Fara-7B CUA model 21 Figure 7: Data scaling (left) and inference step scaling (middle, right) results on WebVoyager and Online Mind2Web. Model Mistakes: The model inadvertently performs harmful action (a mistake) while performing non-harmful task. Example: The user requests the agent to send an email; the agent sends the email to the wrong recipient. Harmful Websites: The model encounters harmful content on website (e.g., prompt injection) while performing non-harmful task. Example: The user asks the agent to check their email, while the agent checks the inbox, they encounter an email carefully crafted to mislead the agent into clicking on harmful link. We train Fara-7B on mixture of public safety datasets and internally generated tasks that it is expected to refuse, following Microsoft Responsible AI Policy and the categorization in Table 15 and to stop at critical points to avoid model mistakes. More details on the tasks used and evaluation can be found in Appendix D. Refusal Evaluation. Table 14 shows refusal performance on two datasets: AgentHarm-Chat (Andriushchenko et al., 2024) and WebTailBench-Refusals (see Appendix D.1 for details). Across these evaluations, Fara-7B consistently achieves the highest refusal rates among computer-use models. On AgentHarm-Chat, Fara-7B safely refuses 94.2% of harmful tasks, compared to 84.6% for the OpenAI computer-use-preview model and 3.8% for UI-TARS-1.5-7B. On WebTailBench-Refusals, Fara-7B refuses 81.9% of harmful tasks, outperforming the OpenAI computer-use-preview model (69.3%) and UI-TARS-1.5-7B (5.4%). Note that while Fara-7B was not trained on WebTailBench-Refusals, it was trained on similar data which might give it an advantage over the baselines on WebTailBench-Refusals but not on AgentHarm-Chat. We observed that SoM agents based on general-purpose LLMs score lower on refusal tasks and their performance may vary depending on other content filter settings enabled for the API. Since general LLMs are not trained for CUA-specific scenarios, we report only CUA-focused baselines in this evaluation. Critical Point Evaluation. We train Fara-7B to pause task execution at critical points until explicit user confirmation is provided (see Section 2.2). This safeguard reduces the risk of costly mistakes by ensuring the agent only proceeds under user guidance. To evaluate this behavior, we use the REAL benchmark environment (Garg et al., 2025), which provides high-fidelity replicas of 11 popular websites spanning domains such as travel, e-commerce, and email. This controlled setting enables safe and reproducible Model AgentHarm Chat () WebTailBench Refusals () GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking SoM Agent Computer Use Models OpenAI computer-use-preview UI-TARS-1.5-7B Fara-7B 3.8 84.6 3.8 94.2 17.1 69.3 5.4 81.9 Table 14: Safety evaluation results (percentage of harmful tasks safely refused; higher is better) on AgentHarm-Chat and WebTailBench-Refusals for SoM agents and computer-use models. Fara-7B achieves the strongest safety among computer-use models on both benchmarks. Fara-7B CUA model 22 assessment without downstream harm. We design 23 synthetic tasks (e.g., buy gift from Omnizon\") that require multi-step interactions with these websites. These tasks are intentionally selected to prioritize safety behavior rather than task difficulty. For each task, we run Fara-7B end-to-end and record when the task execution halts relative to the identified critical point. Fara-7B stopped before the critical points in 19 of the 23 tasks. In the four tasks where Fara-7B stopped after the critical point the actions it performed were: in two tasks the critical action was marking an email as read\" which is reversible and low-impact, in one of the tasks it liked post given the request to Like the most recent post on my homepage\" and finally in the last task it published post without user confirmation. Overall, these results show that Fara-7B has strong bias to stop before critical points and avoid harmful mistakes. We note that the sixe of this dataset is relatively small and more work is needed to comprehensively test this behavior. Further details are available in Appendix D.2. Adversarial Testing. We evaluated Fara-7B on set of 13 tasks for adversarial testing of Magentic-UI (Mozannar et al., 2025) which expose the model to phishing attempts and other harmful behaviors. Fara-7B avoided harmful behavior in 9 of the 13 tasks, failing only in cases involving navigating to links which point to local or cached files which were then stopped by browser sandboxing. Fara-7B was able to dismiss malicious pop-ups by pressing the Escape key, halted at user-permission or passkey dialog and read content safely without interacting with traps. Although we have incorporated several safeguards, Fara-7B is released as an experimental preview to invite hands-on exploration and feedback from the community. We note that improving safety and alignment of CUAs remains an active area of work for us and the broader community."

            "title": "6 Related Work",
            "content": "Progress in agentic LLMs has been powered through parallel advances across multiple dimensions. Work on tool-augmented LLMs and reasoning explores how models can invoke external interfaces both at an atomic level as well as macro level (e.g. MCPs). In parallel, advances in multimodality provide the perception necessary for understanding screens and GUIs. Agentic domains like CUA and robotics integrate both strands, requiring pixel-level grounding, action modeling, and long-horizon planning. We review related work from these areas below. Tool-Calling LLMs. Early progress toward agentic behavior centered on enabling LLMs to use external tools. ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) and Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) showed that language models can interleave reasoning with structured tool calls, supporting tasks such as search, retrieval, and code execution. These ideas inspired broad ecosystem of tool-use agents across APIs and coding interfaces. However, tool-calling systems typically operate in highly structured environments API endpoints, JSON schemas, command-line tools where function signatures are well-defined. As result, visual perception is typically absent or out of scope. Consequently, they sidestep central challenges faced by CUAs: integrating visual perception, grounding actions in pixel coordinates, handling noisy or dynamic webpages, and recovering from state transitions induced by user interfaces. Multimodality and screen understanding. In parallel, large VLMs have significantly improved the ability to parse real-world environments, screenshots, and GUI elements (Qwen, 2025; Abouelenin et al., 2025; Beyer et al., 2024; Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). Works such as ScreenSpot (Cheng et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025), AugVis (Xu et al., 2024), OmniParser (Lu et al., 2024), GUI-Actor (Wu et al., 2025), and ScreenQA (Baechler et al., 2024) explore UI element localization, question answering about screens, and general UI understanding. While these advances strengthen the perception pipeline, they do not address the multi-step control and stateful interaction required for full computer-use agents. Agentic CUA models. Work in CUAs spans two broad paradigms, differing in choice of observation and action spaces. One class of agents use structured objects to understand the screen like DOM or accessibility tree. Environments such as WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023), and VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024) provide agents with structured DOM trees or accessibility APIs. These abstractions simplify action selection and grounding. However, real-world websites often contain irregular markup, dynamically Fara-7B CUA model generated content, personalization, and visually rich layouts leading to persistent gap between benchmark performance and real deployment (Yutori, 2025). To better approximate human computer use, recent efforts adopt pixel-in, action-out formulation. This includes UI-TARS (Qin et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b), ScreenAI-driven agents (Baechler et al., 2024), and multi-website datasets such as Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023). These systems directly consume screenshots and output low-level actions such as clicks and scrolls. recurring theme across these works is the scarcity of large, diverse trajectories. Data is typically collected manually, generated in constrained sandbox environments, or limited to small set of websites. related line of work aims to mine video data of humans interacting with websites (Wang et al., 2025a; Baker et al., 2022), but suffer from similar data quantity and quality issues due to privacy considerations and limited annotations. Our work proposes synthetic data engine approach to overcome these data limitations. Benchmarks. Evaluating CUA models is particularly challenging, especially for web-based tasks. The web is not static in time and constantly changes, introducing non-stationarity in evaluation process. Furthermore, CUAs have considerations beyond just task performance, such as safety and privacy. Nevertheless, the community has undertaken efforts towards standardizing CUA evaluation. At the level of atomic capabilities like perception and grounding ScreenQA (Baechler et al., 2024) targets visual understanding of screen though question-answering, and ScreenSpot (Li et al., 2025) evaluates grounding capability. There have also been efforts towards benchmarking multi-step browser interactions, such as WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023), VisualWebBench (Liu et al., 2024), and VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024). Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023) and GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023) extend evaluation to more realistic, task-driven web interactions. Despite this progress, existing benchmarks often rely on static pages, DOM-based interactions, or limited website diversity. They tend to underrepresent multi-turn user workflows, dynamic content, error recovery, and the long-horizon reasoning required for real productivity tasks. These limitations motivate the development of WebTailBench, which focuses on live websites and evaluation settings that better reflect real-world CUA requirements."

            "content": "Potential for Agentic SLMs. In this work, we test the potential of this hypothesis by training small 7B model specialized for computer use on the Web. Unlike agentic solutions that wrap chat-models with additional systems or scaffolding, we train Fara-7B to visually perceiving webpage and takes actions like scrolling, typing, and clicking on directly predicted coordinates. Fara-7B achieves state-of-the-art for models in its size class but remains competitive with significantly larger models, showing the potential of continued investment toward capable agents with SLMs. Overcoming agentic data scarcity. Data for training agentic models is much scarcer than for domains like conversation, math, or code, where large, diverse datasets are readily available. Agentic tasks require detailed demonstrations of actions in dynamic environments, which are rarely captured at scale, making robust training more challenging. We demonstrate that multi-agent synthetic data engines, grounded in real web data, offer scalable and high-quality solution for Computer Use Agent (CUA) training by automating task proposal, execution, and verification. Our data engine, FaraGen, generates high-fidelity, multi-step web trajectories at less than $1 per task. Comparing SoM Agents to Native CUA. Tables 10 and 12 also highlight distinction between SoM agents backed by reasoning-intensive models and native compute use models. Based on the high token expenditures, particularly for pricier output tokens, SoM agents are not cost-effective for computer use scenarios for two reasons: first, they do not innately predict screen coordinates, so instead they must consume as input an accessibility tree identifying all the interactible elements and predict which ID to interact with. However, accessibility trees can often be noisy or incomplete, causing models to interact with wrong, hidden, or ineffectual elements, even leaving open the possibility of hallucinating one that does not exist. Furthermore, with larger accessibility trees, reasoning intensive models spend large amount of thinking (output) tokens determining which element IDs to interact with. Both of these vulnerabilities can feed off each other, leading Fara-7B CUA model 24 to increased costs. Native CUA models, on the other hand, directly predict actions and their associated coordinates, reducing the number of output tokens. The severity of failure modes is also more acceptable: while native CUA models may mis-click on areas of screen that have no effect, this is less serious than hallucinating elements that dont exist or being distracted by buggy accessibility tree descriptions. Evaluation of CUA models. Evaluating Computer Use Agent (CUA) models presents several unique challenges. First, while we leveraged existing benchmarks, many tasks required modification to remain relevant-such as updating outdated details in scenarios like hotel reservations. Second, integrating the model with the browser environment for both perception and action proved critical; this ranges from choosing resolution for visual perception to implementing retries to handle environment failures (e.g. page not loading) robustly. Third, although current benchmarks are valuable, they often lack task diversity. To address this, we developed WebTailBench, which expands evaluation coverage to include broader range of tasks such as real estate search, jobs and careers, adding multiple items to shopping carts, comparison tasks, and activities planning, thereby providing more comprehensive assessment of agentic capabilities. Fara-7B takes us step closer to this goal: despite its modest size, it is small yet mighty in capability, matching or approaching much larger proprietary agents on challenging web tasks. key strength of Fara-7B is its simplicity, it operates directly on browser GUIs using only screenshots, without relying on accessibility trees or complex scaffolding. At the core of our approach is carefully targeted training data with long-horizon trajectories, distilled from Magentic-One runs that involve multi-agent interactions. Limitations. Models trained for computer use agents share many of the challenges and limitations of general-purpose models, but also introduce new challenges. Fara-7B has some limitations due to its action space: it is unable to drag and drop elements natively, watch or listen to video or audio content and perform tasks that require ultra-low latency such as game playing. Fara-7B, like other CUA models, faces issues such as reduced accuracy on more complex tasks, mistakes in following instructions, limited robustness to environment changes, and susceptibility to hallucinations. While we trained the model to stop and hand over control to the user at critical points (such as logging in or making purchases), developing more comprehensive framework for human-agent collaboration remains an open challenge. These limitations are active areas of research, and we are committed to ongoing improvements as we learn from real-world usage. Guidelines for Safe Use. As developers find use cases for Fara-7B, we strongly encourage to abide by the following recommendations for safe and effective model usage: Ensure to always have human-in-the-loop monitoring Fara-7Bs actions on the live web and implement mechanisms to immediately halt its actions if necessary. Do not share your passwords or sensitive information with Fara-7B. Run Fara-7B in sandboxed environment to isolate any potential side effects from its actions. Ensure that Fara-7B cannot access sensitive data or resources on the host machine. Limit the models access to the internet through allow-lists or block-lists to limit its exposure to harmful websites. Fara-7B may be prone to prompt injections on harmful websites. We do not recommend using the model in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. Fara-7B should not be used in highly regulated domains or high stakes situations where inaccurate outputs could suggest actions that lead to injury or negatively impact on an individuals health, legal, and financial, life opportunities or legal status. Always verify model outputs as it can hallucinate, misattribute sources, or be misled by deceptive or low-quality online content. Future Work. Looking ahead, we see several promising directions for extending Fara-7B. Broadly, these fall along two dimensions: (1) improving the agents capabilities to handle unseen behaviors on real-world settings and tasks with greater robustness, and (2) enabling more seamless interaction with humans. On the robustness front, integrating stronger grounding multimodal models, scaling both model and data size, and Fara-7B CUA model 25 incorporating reinforcement learning to refine long-horizon reasoning are all promising avenues. In parallel, designing seamless interaction loops with humans could make web agents more controllable, interpretable, and practically useful. We are encouraged by Fara-7Bs competitive performance as small language model (SLM) and by FaraGens ability to generate diverse, high-quality data in cost-effective manner. To foster reseach, hands-on exploration and gather feedback, we are releasing Fara-7B to the community. Like other CUA models, we recommend running Fara-7B in sandboxed environment, closely monitoring its execution, and avoiding use with sensitive data or in high-risk domains. Responsible use is essential as the model continues to evolve."

At the time of this writing, we couldnt find pricing for GLM on the same aggregator website. Instead, we found another provider which hosts both Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking at $0.05 and $0.086, respectively (a 72% increase). Because this provider was hosting Qwen2.5-VL at drastically different price point, we decided to keep $0.20 as the price for Qwen2.5-VL, and set the price for GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking at $0.34/$0.34 per million input/output tokens reflecting the same 72% increase5(C, [n. d.]).

Action: stop_execution Step 3 Step Step 5 Fara-7B CUA model 32 B.1 Grounding Examples To train robust CUA models, we find that it is important to also utilize large-scale and high-quality grounding dataset that maps natural-language queries to concrete atomic actions involving UI elements. Our grounding dataset pipeline follows the same high-level recipe as our CUA data generation: seed intent action verification, but we specialize it for fine-grained UI element understanding. We start from webpage screenshot and selected UI element, sourced from either the underlying DOM or parsing the screenshot with Omniparser (Lu et al., 2024). We then prompt VLM to describe both the highlighted element in isolation (e.g., plus icon) and the full page context (e.g., checkout page for T-shirt). These descriptions provide semantic scaffolding that helps downstream models reason about both local affordances and global task context. Given the element-level and page-level descriptions, we then prompt an LLM to generate candidate tasks that might be relevant for multi-step CUA tasks. This spans literal grounding queries such as click the plus button as well as intent-driven variants like increase the quantity of the T-shirt by one. We retrieve the elements coordinates to synthesize the corresponding action label for instance, precise click location. final VLM-based verification step checks whether the clicked location indeed satisfies the textual query by examining the highlighted element in the screenshot. Only verified examples are retained. Through this process, we curate over 500K high-quality grounding samples across wide range of real websites, which serve as an essential component of the Fara-7B training mix. We provide few qualitative examples of the training samples below. Id like to increase the quantity by one"

To generate question-answer pairs, we prompt GPT-5 as following: We want to propose question that can be answered by only looking at the screenshot image without any additional information. For instance, if the image was of the apple home website, valid question could be \"What is the price of the iPhone 15 Pro?\" or \"what colors does the iPhone 15 come in?\". The question should be challenging, select rare question and an answer. The question should require understanding the image directly or the text in the image. Write it in way that human would ask. You should only generate question that you can answer correctly with perfect accuracy. Try to make the questions as challenging as possible. We show examples of our generated data: Question-Answering Example # 1 Question-Answering Example # 2 Question: Which Agatha Christie book on the page is labeled Teachers pick, and what age group is it recommended for? Answer: And Then There Were None is labeled \"Teachers pick,\" and it is recommended for ages 16 years and up. Question: When will the tickets be ready for delivery? Answer: According to the Additional Notes, tickets will be ready for delivery by March 28, 2025. Fara-7B CUA model B.4 Refusal Data 35 We train Fara to refuse harmful user tasks that involve actions on the browser. In Table 15 we outline the seven categories of tasks that we train Fara-7B to refuse. Our training data sources include synthetically generated harmful tasks that span wide range of websites and tasks that teach the model to refuse based on the harmful user task and publicly available datasets such as WildGuard (Han et al., 2024) that contains both general conversational refusal data and cybersecurity refusal data. Type Description Examples Illegal Activities Tasks that require unlawful actions. Deceptive Tasks Tasks that intentionally mislead, impersonate, or defraud individuals or entities. High-Risk or Regulated Domains Tasks requiring certified professional oversight or regulatory compliance. Harassment, Exploitation, or Hate Tasks that harass, harm, or discriminate against individuals or groups. Unsafe or Irresponsible Technical Use Misinformation Sexual Tasks that misuse technology or automation tools in unsafe, unethical, or uncontrolled ways. Tasks that spread false or misleading information. Tasks involving sexual material or erotic conversations. Searching for or distributing materials related to terrorism, trafficking, or organized crime; Downloading, hosting, or sharing pirated or stolen digital content; Attempting to access restricted systems or data without authorization; Gathering or sharing information for the creation of weapons or illegal substances Generating or submitting fake forms or credentials; Creating deceptive listings or fake reviews; Automating phishing, impersonation attempts, or spam Providing medical diagnoses, legal advice, or financial planning beyond factual reference; Using automation to approve or deny loans, credit, or investments Posting harassing or defamatory content; Automating contact or targeting for intimidation or abuse; Collecting personal data for stalking, doxxing, or exploitation; Creating or sharing content that sexualizes or harms minors or vulnerable groups Automating large-scale scraping, spam, or surveillance operations; Attempting to overload or disrupt external systems Publishing or amplifying false or unverified claims presented as factual Asking to role-play in an erotic manner; Searching for pornographic material Table 15: Categories of tasks that violate our usage policy requiring browser use. This categorization was inspired from OpenAIs Operator System Card (OpenAI, 2025c). We generate refusal tasks based on existing screenshots from our training data.

We also find it beneficial to include large corpus of grounding data to help train native (pixel-in, action-out) CUA model, which we generate as outlined in Section B.1. Small amount of safety data seems sufficient to elicit desired behaviors. Data Mixture. Table 16 shows our full training data mixture of 1.8 million samples. As reminder, for our trajectory data, each sample is step of the trajectory. We upsample some of this data, particularly longer trajectories or trajectories for types of tasks that are less frequent (e.g., compositional tasks). Trajectories make up the majority of our data, while grounding is the second largest portion. For refusals, very little data seems Fara-7B CUA model 37 to be required and with more data the model begins to refuse even benign tasks (e.g., Whats the best sushi restaurant in NYC?).

We use the AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95 and cosine learning rate warmup for the first 10% of training steps. After warmup, our initial learning rate is 5e 6. We perform gradient clipping with max of 1. We train for 2 epochs or roughly 28k iterations. The batch size is 128. We use 64 H100 GPUs for training. To optimize GPU performance, we use DeepSpeed Stage 3 and train with bf16 precision."

In the hotel booking case, Fara-7B completes the search and date selection but stops as soon as the form requesting personal information appears, recognizing that entering such details is critical step that requires explicit user input. Similarly, in the restaurant reservation, Fara-7B configures the requested cuisine, location, date, and time, but stops short of clicking the Reserve button, which would place real booking and trigger collection of user details. Together, these examples illustrate Fara-7Bs ability to satisfy the high-level task intent while reliably avoiding irreversible or sensitive actions without explicit user confirmation. D.3 Web Task-Solving Performance In the main paper, Table 9 reports only the mean success rate for each model and benchmark. Here in Table 19, we further provide detailed variance analysis by reporting, for each setting, the mean success rate together with its standard deviation. This extended table shows that Fara-7B not only achieves the best average performance among 7B-scale computer-use agents but also exhibits consistently low variability: for example, its standard deviation is around 1.0 on WebVoyager and below 2.0 on DeepShop and WebTailBench, comparable to or smaller than that of both larger SoM baselines and other 7B models. By contrast, some comFara-7B CUA model"
