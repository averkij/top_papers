            "title": "1 Introduction\nSketching is one of the most accessible and intuitive ways for users\nto visually convey dynamic authoring intent, i.e., how they wish\nelements to change over time and space, particularly in expressive\ncontent domains such as film and animation [4, 7]. Traditionally,\nsketches are used in two complementary ways to express dynamic\nintent. The first is as storyboards [27]. From early Disney anima-\ntion [51] to contemporary film production [52], sketches are com-\nbined with scripts to depict keyframes and narrative flow. The\nsecond is as free-form annotations, where marks such as arrows,\ndashed lines, and curves are used to suggest temporal evolution\nor spatial transformations [13]. Together, these practices enable\npeople to represent sequences of motion and interaction without\nrequiring full implementation, offering a lightweight yet powerful\nfoundation for subsequent production.",
            "content": "Building on these practices, research has explored how to interpret users authoring intent from sketches and translate that intent into final content. For example, generative models can add and remove objects in video based on sketch drawn on single video frame [44, 45], or generate an entire video sequence from storyboard sketch [43, 75]. Beyond generation, sketches have also been explored for incremental authoring [14, 31, 34], where users construct animations step by step and each stroke is recognized [66] or matched to predefined command [14], triggering corresponding system actions (e.g., appearing, translating, or morphing) that gradually accumulate into complete animated result. However, these approaches often constrain the expressive potential of sketches, limiting them either to static layout representations or to predefined visual forms that encode specific animation commands. As result, sketches shift from being an approach for open-ended creativity to functioning as rigid control tokens, missing the opportunity to harness their flexibility and spontaneity for expressing free-form dynamic intent, such as motion and interaction [63]. We aim to investigate how free-form sketches can effectively capture dynamic intent and be leveraged as foundation for generating dynamic content. Fortunately, recent advances in visionlanguage models (VLMs) have introduced powerful visual understanding capabilities, including the ability to interpret abstract and informal sketches. Such capabilities have been demonstrated in recent works such as CodeShaping [69], though primarily in the domain of code generation. We select motion graphics as our starting point, as they offer accessible yet expressive animations with clear motion dynamics, making them practical setting for investigating the alignment between sketches and generated animations. Specifically, we focus on explainer-style motion graphics with the roles of teaching aid and visual discourse [11], which are widely used across diverse domains and age groups [29], prioritizing the clarity of motion over visual realism to effectively communicate concepts [24]. Building on this foundation, we conduct three-stage study to explore how sketch-based interactions can drive dynamic content creation. In the first stage, to study sketch expressiveness and VLM interpretation, we provide unified web interface where users can draw free-form sketch storyboards to generate animated videos through code-based rendering. The results highlight the strong potential of free-form sketches to convey animation intent with minimal, intuitive input (see Fig. 5 for collection of such examples), though their inherent ambiguity often leaves user intention underspecified. To address this, the second stage introduces clarification cue that adaptively matches sketch ambiguity level, offering lightweight interface interactions for users to intervene in the VLMs interpretation. Findings suggest that clarification turns sketch ambiguity into resource for intent articulation, but some intentions only become concrete when users view the generated output and refine it accordingly. Therefore, in the last stage, we develop an intuitive visual editing approach that allows users to express their intent on top of the generated result directly. The refinement mechanism closes the gap between system output and user intent, allowing precise control with low effort. In general, rather than pursuing high-quality video results, our contribution lies in reactivating the expressive freedom of sketches, which are casual and intuitive drawings that anyone can produce to freely convey dynamic intent without any constraints. Here are our contributions: We propose sketch-based dynamic intent expression paradigm where sketches are not predefined forms or fixed commands, but as open-ended prompts, in which sketch ambiguity, VLM interpretation, and user intervention collaboratively shape dynamic content. We implement SketchDynamics, proof-of-concept instantiation of this paradigm, using free-form sketch storyboards to generate explainer-style motion graphics, supported by an adaptive clarification interface and multimodal input for iterative refinement. Through three-stage user study, we validate the effectiveness of this paradigm. We demonstrate its capacity to support diverse free-form sketches, enabling users to articulate precise dynamic intent with minimal interaction.

            "title": "2 Related Work\n2.1 Understand Authoring Intent in Sketch\nSketching has long been valued for its ability to convey authoring\nintent through just a few strokes, making it a widely adopted prac-\ntice in early-stage ideation across fields such as architecture [38, 72],\nart, animation, and user interface design [34]. Numerous HCI re-\nsearchers have explored how sketches can produce meaningful\nresults for rapid prototyping, emphasizing their immediacy and\nfluidity as a medium [10].",
            "content": "A major part of this research treats sketches or single strokes as predefined symbols or commands [55, 66, 71]. With simple stroke recognition methods [19] like the $1 recognizer [66], the system could classify sketches and trigger specific operations. seminal example is SILK [34], which allowed interface designers to hand-draw UI widgets and manipulate them with drawn strokes. Lineogrammer [73] extended this idea by beautifying sketches into clean diagrams and introducing more flexible action sketches, such as joining lines or lasso selection, enabling intuitive manipulation without tool switching. Using similar technical pipeline, K-Sketch [14] introduces an interface that enables novice users to create 2D animations through informal sketches. These interfaces provided immediate feedback by recognizing drawn shapes as components and commands, preserving the speed and informality of sketching. However, as shown in Fig 2, these systems interpret sketches through rigid one-to-one mappings, translating recognized symbols (e.g., arrows, lassos) directly into predefined graphical transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) or specific animation effects (e.g., morphing, fading). To support such mappings, designers needed to predefine gesture categories and their corresponding actions, meaning that users had to learn and conform to the systems sketchaction vocabulary. As result, while interaction felt informal and fluid, the semantic space of motion intent remains constrained to what had been explicitly encoded, preventing sketches from expressing abstract, causal, or contextual forms of motion intent. Therefore, some research has moved beyond hand-coded sketch mapping, learning to infer higher-level intent behind sketch [26]. Instead of asking what symbol was drawn?, these systems learn to ask what does the user mean by this drawing? In user interface design, Swire [22] exemplifies this shift by training neural network on thousands of drawn UIs: it can interpret free-form sketch of UI layout in terms of its semantic similarity to existing interface examples. Samuelsson et al. [56] conducted an elicitation study with software engineers to understand how sketches might express code editing commands. Building on such insights, Code Shaping [69] introduced an interactive environment where developers draw directly over their source code to invoke edits. Behind this is the ability of current visionlanguage models: rather than simple classification, such models can understand quite abstract sketches, interpret them, and generate new content. However, VLMs cannot always understand what users want to express in free-form drawings. Beyond the limitations of current algorithms for sketch understanding, an important reason is that sketches inherently carry ambiguity [63]. Some prior work has addressed this by imposing additional constraints to guide the AIs interpretation. For example, Code Shaping ultimately introduced command brushes, restricted set of sketch shapes each mapped to specific edit operation, in order to improve recognition reliability. While this approach improved accuracy, it effectively reintroduced symbolic shorthand, thereby limiting the expressive freedom of sketching. In contrast, we view ambiguity not as flaw to be eliminated but as feature that can drive creative workflows [17]. Our approach further explores engaging users in co-interpretation, where the system proposes an interpretation and the user iteratively refines or corrects it. This paradigm is especially well-suited to animation and dynamic media authoring, where sketches are inherently provisional and iterative refinement aligns with how creators naturally explore temporal ideas [13]."

            "title": "2.2 Sketch as a Generation Prompt\nSketches have been widely explored as prompts for generative algo-\nrithms due to their intuitive and expressive nature. Since sketches\nprovide a quick and intuitive way to communicate spatial struc-\nture and layout, they have been widely used to guide the gen-\neration of static content such as images [9, 41, 67, 74], 3D mod-\nels [48, 49], websites [2, 58]. Building on these applications, recent\nwork [25, 32, 43, 45, 75] has begun to explore the use of sketches\nin dynamic content generation, where conveying temporal and se-\nmantic change becomes essential. In pixel-based video generation,\nsketches can be drawn directly onto images to indicate motion tra-\njectories or directional flow, serving as intuitive cues for generating\nanimated sequences [32]. Alternatively, sketches are used as masks\nor editing guides, allowing users to specify which regions of a video\nshould change and how those transformations evolve over time\ntime [45, 61, 68].",
            "content": "While sketch cues overlaid on images are effective for indicating short-term motion or localized edits, recent works [12, 16, 18, 35] have begun exploring sketch storyboards to support longer-range structure and narrative purely through sketch. Traditionally used in early-stage film and animation ideation, sketch storyboards offer sequence-based representation of motion and narrative intent, making them natural fit for guiding generative algorithms [20]. Different systems adopt sketch storyboards in domain-specific ways. SketchVideo[43] treats sketches as static illustrations of each keyframes visual structure, using carefully drawn outlines to guide photorealistic image generation. Sketch2Anim[75], on the other hand, relies on predefined sketch format, typically stick figure combined with trajectory, to represent skeletal movement across frames. In both cases, the sketch input is tightly constrained and tailored to the specific task. While effective for domain-specific tasks, these constrained sketch representations fall short for motion graphics video creation, where compositions often feature multiple vector-based elements moving in abstract, stylized, or non-physical ways [5, 33]. Such sketch formats impose rigid structural or pose constraints, limiting users ability to articulate complex and unconventional animation ideas [69]. To overcome these limitations, we adopt free-form sketch storyboards that support open-ended drawing without constraints, enabling richer expression of spatial, temporal, and stylistic intent. This flexibility allows sketches to function not as fixed blueprints but as adaptable cues that guide generation. Building on this foundation, our system further supports an interactive, iterative authoring CHI 26, April 1317, 2026, Barcelona, Spain Boyu Li, Lin-Ping Yuan, Zeyu Wang, and Hongbo Fu Figure 2: Prior systems [14, 2931] treat sketches as symbols to be mapped to animation commands (Top). In contrast, we treat sketches as semantic expressions of motion intent (Bottom), leveraging VLM-based commonsense reasoning and human-AI clarification to interpret why and how motion happens. process, allowing users to refine their animations over multiple rounds rather than relying on one-shot generation."

            "content": "Creating motion graphics or vector animations traditionally requires substantial expertise and professional tools such as Adobe After Effects [15]. HCI research has long sought to lower this barrier by developing more intuitive authoring paradigms. Early sketchdriven systems such as Draco [30] and Kitty [29] let users draw scenes and motion cues directly on the canvas, inferring causal animations without requiring keyframe editing, while SketchStory [36] applied similar ideas to animated data storytelling. These works emphasize continuous, pen-on-canvas interaction over traditional timelines. Building on this, more recent end-to-end systems scaffold the entire workflow for novices: Katika [24] guides users from storyboards or scripts to finished videos via libraries of pre-designed animations, and DancingBoard [8] streamlines motion-comic production with guided steps and automated animation suggestions. Some works focus on more specialized domains of vector animation. In data visualization, tools such as Data Illustrator [47] and Data Animator [60] enable designers to create animated charts as if drawing static graphics, automatically interpolating between states. For text animation, works like The Kinetic Typography Engine [37] and TextAlive [28] demonstrated powerful systems where users could algorithmically define and control motion. Piet [57] further extends this direction by providing targeted interfaces that facilitate color authoring in motion graphics videos. Most recently, AI-driven authoring has emerged: Keyframer [62] and AnyAni [54] use large language models to translate natural-language prompts into editable vector animations, supporting iterative refinement through text or direct manipulation. Building on this trajectory, researchers have begun to explore how visionlanguage models (VLMs) can support motion graphics generation. MoVer [50] introduces motion verification DSL that encodes spatio-temporal properties of animations in first-order logic, demonstrating how formal reasoning can be applied to ensure correctness of motion behaviors. LogoMotion [46] analyzes vector graphics (SVGs) to automatically suggest motion designs, showing how pre-existing assets can be transformed into animations. These works highlight the potential of AI models to reason about both semantics and temporal logic in vector-based media. However, gap remains. Existing systems have largely focused on short, self-contained examples with relatively few animated elements, often suited for toy demos or tightly scoped use cases. In contrast, many real motion graphics videoseven simple explainersalready involve multiple objects evolving over time, which introduces additional complexity for authoring and interpretation. Supporting such scenarios requires more direct and flexible visual guidance, enabling creators to express dynamic intent without relying solely on predefined templates or textual prompts. In this paper, we explore freeform sketches as visual guidance mechanism. Sketches offer an intuitive way to externalize spatialtemporal ideas, while VLMs can interpret these abstractions into vector animations. This combination bridges informal creative expression with structured animation output, extending bi-directional editing [21] to non-programmers."

In this stage, we implemented unified interface that understood sketch storyboards from users and transformed them into motion graphic videos (Sec. 4.1). We explored how participants naturally expressed animation intent through free-form sketches and how these sketches were interpreted when directly converted into videos. The study findings revealed that participants tended to use highly diverse and abstract sketches for quick prototyping. However, even though the VLM demonstrated impressive capacity to interpret many inputs, it still often failed when confronted with ambiguous sketches. Stage 2: Investigating ambiguity in sketch interpretation. Through empirical use in the first stage, we identified recurring cases where user sketches were too abstract or ambiguous for the system to interpret reliably (e.g., an arrow could indicate either translation or rotation). This led us to investigate lightweight way for enabling users to intervene in the machines interpretation process. In this stage, we proposed clarification cue mechanism (see Sec. 5.1), which separated ambiguity into four levels and provided adaptive interfaces for user input. Our study showed that participants generally considered clarification requests reasonable and helpful, noting that such prompts not only reduced misinterpretation but also assisted them in further shaping their intent. Stage 3: Exploring more intuitive iterative editing. Not all ambiguities could be resolved in the early stage, as some sketches were too underspecified to be faithfully interpreted until video was generated to provide additional context. In this stage, we investigated how users could refine the output when it did not meet their expectations, introducing frame-based interaction method (see Sec. 6.1) that combined keyframe extraction and annotation to offer clearer guidance toward the desired result. Our study showed that the refinement strategy was efficient and intuitive, allowing participants to annotate video frames to express intent with minimal effort."

The interface consisted of three connected views\n(Fig.4). In the sketch view (Fig. 4-A), users drew on a central canvas\nusing freehand strokes.

We tested two input strategies: (1) feeding each sketch individually with its script, and (2) compositing all sketches and text scripts into single storyboard input. Results indicated that the second approach produced more coherent and temporally consistent animations, likely because the model could better reason across sequential sketches. This strategy was therefore adopted in subsequent development. The second step was to render the generated code into video. We instructed the VLM to output executable Manim [1] Python code, which was then compiled into animations. Manim, declarative animation library widely used for educational explainer videos, provided the rendering backend. This code-first design not only enabled fine-grained control at the script level (e.g., timing, trajectories, styles) but also ensured that animations were built from scalable vector-based primitives, making the video extensible and well-suited for future iterative editing."

Instead, we asked participants to imagine creating short explainer video for concept of their choice. To keep the task manageable while still showcasing the workflow, we provided three guidelines: (1) the video should illustrate concept that can be reasonably explained through basic shapes, (2) participants should avoid overly complex shapes or animation techniques, and (3) the storyboard should be concise, consisting of around four sketches. Specifically, we limited concepts to logical explanations to evaluate functional accuracy; We restricted visuals to basic shapes to abstract away illustrative details, allowing participants to focus their cognitive effort on articulating dynamic logic (e.g., causality, flow) rather than static aesthetics; and we focused on fundamental animation primitives (e.g., displacement, deformation) rather than high-dimensional tasks like character animation, as their complexity makes it difficult to verify the specific animation intent. We conducted the experiment on desktop interface with mouse-based interaction, as our focus was not on the precision of sketching. We restricted visuals to basic shapes to abstract away illustrative details, allowing participants to focus their cognitive effort on articulating dynamic logic (e.g., causality, flow) rather than static aesthetics Procedure. Participants began the experiment by completing survey to gather information on their prior experience with video creation and sketching (Appendix. C). Next, they were given brief overview of the project and shown the core features of the interface. Some example cases were presented to illustrate the expected input and outcome. We specifically presented examples of free-form sketches and encouraged participants to use more flexible sketching methods to express their ideas, with less emphasis on scripting. Following the introduction, participants had 10-minute exploration phase, where they could experiment with the sketching tools, test the generation of animation previews, and become familiar with the interfaces capabilities. Participants then moved on to the creation phase, where each participant was tasked with creating three separate videos, each representing different content.

Expanding the Role of Sketches. In our study, sketches served not only as way to specify layout or static elements, but also as medium for expressing animation intent. When attempting to represent dynamics, participants resorted to wide variety of abstract conventions such as arrows (Fig. 5-B), onion skinning for future states (Fig. 5-D), or index numbers for sequencing (Fig. 5-C). However, these conventions were highly diverse and often idiosyncratic, shaped by individual habits and prior experiences. For instance, P3 emphasized that everyone has their own way of drawing arrows, mine is from engineering class, while P6 noted that sometimes just use circles, sometimes line, it depends on what comes to mind first. This diversity meant that the same animation could be represented in multiple ways, and similar sketches could point to different intentions. As P4 reflected, the arrow could mean movement, or just attention, it depends on the context. Indeed, 7 out of 8 participants explicitly remarked that they have their own strategies to depict movement, often no regulation (P2) or quite random (P5). This means that free-form sketching opened up broad expressive space, but one that was highly individualized and semantically unstable, requiring interpretation and negotiation when used to communicate temporal behaviors. CHI 26, April 1317, 2026, Barcelona, Spain Boyu Li, Lin-Ping Yuan, Zeyu Wang, and Hongbo Fu Sketch Interpretation Beyond Expectations. Participants often experimented with sketches that were highly abstract or loosely defined, yet many of these were still interpreted meaningfully by the model. Several participants created inventive sketch forms to convey intentfor example, using gesture line or symbolic marks to indicate motion or transformation. Despite this, 6 out of 8 participants admitted that, at the beginning, they doubted whether such free-form drawings could be understood by the machine. P8 further reflected that some sketches were inherently ambiguous, different people could read it differently. While some outputs indeed diverged from their expectations, participants often adapted by redrawing their sketches or supplementing them with short text scripts to clarify intent. Interestingly, in 7 cases, participants reported being positively surprised when the system successfully captured the essence of their sketches in ways they had not anticipated. Although the user ratings  (Fig. 12)  indicate that most participants felt the animations were not perfect match to their intended outcome, they still perceived the results as capturing their intent to some extent and described them as unexpected but meaningful. Semantics over geometry. recurring theme was that the VLM often prioritized semantic intent rather than literal geometric fidelity. Instead of replicating sketches exactly, the model tended to generate canonical or cleaned-up versions of the intended motion. For instance, when P6 drew wobbly sine curve, the output appeared as smooth sinusoid. P6 described this as beautified, appreciating that the messy strokes became clearer in the final animation. Similarly, P9 noted that their rough arrows were rendered as consistent trajectories, which they found nicer than expected. However, this abstraction also created moments of mismatch. P4, who attempted to specify very precise trajectory, complained that the output ignored the exact angle drew. Likewise, P11 commented that it feels like it understood the idea but not the detail. In total, 7 of 8 participants remarked that the system often generalized their sketches to capture meaning rather than form, with reactions ranging from surprise and delight to mild frustration. Several (e.g., P3, P5) responded by redrawing shapes or adding text notes to enforce precision. Balancing detail and abstraction in sketching. Participants varied in how much detail they invested in their sketch storyboards. At one extreme, some treated the canvas almost like frame-byframe storyboard, drawing each scene carefully to make their intent explicit. While this approach produced clearer outputs, participants also described it as tedious (P3) and too much effort for short video (P7). In contrast, many preferred using abstract marks that conveyed animation intent more quickly. As P6 explained, this was the fastest way to show the idea, even though it sometimes made the systems interpretation less predictable. P8 similarly noted that abstract cues save time but leave ambiguity. This trade-off reflects central tension: detailed sketches improve clarity but increase workload, while abstract sketches reduce effort but demand stronger interpretive support from the model. Reflecting this tension, P5 emphasized that although they were willing to rely on abstract sketches, they expected the system to just understand the sketch without needing additional textual specification."

            "content": "Rather than treating ambiguity as an error to be eliminated, we approached it as variable condition to be managed. Our design philosophy was to preserve the freedom of freehand sketching while offering just-in-time interventions to clarify intent when needed. This philosophy echoes early ideas of free-form sketch beautification [23], supporting multiple candidates for ambiguity and requesting the users interaction. To this end, we adopted layered prompting strategy that adaptively maps the degree of ambiguity to different levels of system intervention. This draws on the principle of progressive disclosure: users only encounter as much clarification effort as the ambiguity of their sketches demands, thereby minimizing disruption while maintaining interpretability. Concretely, based on previous research [3, 14] about sketch ambiguity and empirical results from the first stage, we developed four complementary mechanisms that align with increasing levels of sketch ambiguity, ranging from low to very high, each offering progressively richer forms of clarification, as shown in Fig. 6. Quick confirm. For low-uncertainty cases such as uncertain strokes or vague geometry [64], the system generates primary guess SketchDynamics: Exploring Free-Form Sketches for Dynamic Intent Expression in Animation Generation CHI 26, April 1317, 2026, Barcelona, Spain Figure 6: Illustration of ambiguity clarification.

Top: different types of ambiguities in storyboards, Bottom: the corresponding types of information needed to resolve them, mapped to our clarification strategies. and asks the user for yes/no confirmation (e.g., Should this line be used as motion path?). Multiple choice. When sketch could plausibly mean several different things [17], the system presents alternative previews and asks the user to pick the intended one (e.g., curved arrow could be shown as either rotation or decorative arrow). Fill value. For actions that are recognized but lack specific parameters, the interface asks for numeric or scalar values. While many aspects of the video could in principle be parameterized, we prompt only for those with significant impact on the outcome. For example [14], the system may ask how long ball should take to traverse path, while leaving minor details such as fade-in duration to sensible defaults. Text or upload resources. In cases where sketches are highly abstract or symbolic [17, 63], the system allows users to provide free-form clarification, either as short text note or by uploading an external reference asset. After completing sketch storyboard, users proceed to generation in the AI video view. When they press [Generate Script], if the VLM confidently interprets the sketches, the interface produces the animation code and renders preview video directly. When ambiguities are detected, however, the interface does not produce arbitrary results; instead, it pops up clarification panel. For example, if curved arrow could be read as either rotation or decoration, the interface presents two animated previews for the user to select the intended one. In another case, if users symbol is too abstract, they can upload custom SVG asset (e.g., heart icon to represent an object appearing with pop effect). For implementation, as shown in Fig 7, the clarification mechanism is supported through prompt engineering and contextual memory. The VLM is explicitly instructed to request clarifications only when necessary and only on aspects that critically affect the generated animation, avoiding excessive or redundant queries. When the user provides input, such as selecting between preview options or uploading an external SVG asset, these responses are added as supplementary context for regeneration. In addition, the system maintains an intention disambiguation memory, which records user-provided clarifications and automatically reuses them when the same sketch is edited and regenerated later."

The system detects ambiguities in sketches, classifies them by level, prepares them as JSON for the interface generator, and prompts users with lightweight clarifications (e.g., confirmation, choice, value input, or asset upload). User responses are used as supplementary prompt for regeneration and stored in an intent disambiguation memory to avoid repeated queries in future generations. the cues as opportunities to make their intent explicit and avoid wasted generations. Overall Cue Usage. Figure 8 summarizes the distribution of cue types per attempt in the form of heatmap. The pattern shows that multiple choice cues were triggered most frequently, reflecting the prevalence of sketches with more than one plausible interpretation, which is the most common ambiguity. Quick confirm cues were relatively rare, as the model often resolved low-ambiguity cases confidently without further questioning. Fill value cues also appeared infrequently because the system was designed to ask only for parameters with major impact on the outcome, and that case is relatively uncommon. By contrast, text/upload cues occurred at moderate level, indicating that participants frequently drew highly abstract or symbolic sketches (e.g., rough icons) that required extra resources or textual hints. In these cases, the prototype demonstrated its ability to reason semantically about the sketch and prompt the user for relevant supplementary information. The heatmap also reveals strong variation across attempts. We did not include detailed per-attempt breakdowns of cue types in the paper, as these would be too granular, but the heatmap variation and density of cue usage across the study are meaningful. Some creations, such as T5 and T13, required dense sequence of cues (up to 56 within one attempt), while others (e.g., T7, T14) proceeded with almost no intervention. This disparity highlights how cue demand was closely tied to the degree of abstraction in the sketch. For instance, P3 commented that only needed help when drew something unusual, whereas P8 described the cue prompts as relief when was not sure if the sketch was understandable. User Reactions to Cue. Participants generally responded positively to the clarification cues, with 7 out of 8 noting that they helped avoid misleading outputs and made them more aware of the ambiguity in their sketches. Quick confirm cues were described as lightweight and easy to dismiss, while multiple choice cues were seen as the most necessary since arrows and curves often admitted multiple interpretations. For example, in T10 participant drew looping arrow and appreciated being asked to choose between rotation and decorative arrow. Fill value cues divided opinions: some found specifying duration or speed helpful, while others felt it broke the free-flow nature of sketching. Text/Upload cues, though requiring more effort, were valued when rough sketches stood in for specific icons. In T23, participant drew rough star sketch, which triggered clarification cue suggesting the upload of pentagram icon. P8 remarked that they were surprised the system could interpret such an abstract mark as symbolic request for sparkle effect. Overall, all participants felt that the clarification cues made sense in resolving sketch ambiguities. According to the user rating  (Fig. 12)  , compared with stage 1, clarification cues generally align the users intention with the final animations, and participants did SketchDynamics: Exploring Free-Form Sketches for Dynamic Intent Expression in Animation Generation CHI 26, April 1317, 2026, Barcelona, Spain Figure 8: Heatmap of clarification cue usage across 24 tasks (T1 to T24).

The Result after Cue. After clarification, 19 out of 24 attempts produced outputs that participants rated as closer to their intended animation, compared to the initial generation. In 7 attempts, users explicitly described the cue as the turning point that made the result usable (e.g., P6: the timing became right only after entered the value). Fill value cues directly improved temporal qualities: in T13 and T21, entering duration smoothed otherwise abrupt motions. Text/Upload cues often corrected semantic mismatches: in T23, replacing hand-drawn star with an SVG asset transformed the effect into what P8 called finally what had in mind. By contrast, Multiple choice cues mainly resolved directional intent; in T10, choosing rotation instead of arrow symbol shifted the system output to match the participants storyboard. Failures still occurred: 2 attempts involving physical dynamics remained unsatisfactory even after cues, suggesting limits in the models reasoning rather than the cue mechanism. Taken together, the logs show that cues did not simply add extra interaction but often directly determined whether sketch led to usable animation. Workflow Integration. Participants emphasized that the clarification cues were most valuable when integrated smoothly into the overall authoring workflow, rather than appearing as separate steps. In practice, cues were triggered inline during generation and resolved within few clicks, which participants described as not disruptive (P3) and just part of the flow (P6). Several participants noted that without these cues, the system might guess wrong (P5) or return outputs that look nothing like what wanted (P2). By contrast, lightweight confirmations or multiple-choice previews felt like natural checkpoints that improved trust in the system. Importantly, participants highlighted that the cues helped them understand how the model interpreted their sketch, giving them sense of control. As P8 put it, can see what the AI thinks, and fix it right away. Overall, rather than slowing down creation, clarification cues were seen as seamlessly woven into the workflow, balancing automation with user agency."

In 10 of the 12 final outputs, users reported that the unaffected portions of the video remained stable, which they considered crucial to maintaining creative momentum. In the user ratings  (Fig. 12)  , although completing animations in this stage took longer than in the previous stages, participants did not report corresponding increase in perceived effort. This suggests that the interface interaction is efficient even with the added steps, and the improved animation outcomes justified the additional time. In interviews, six participants noted that this locality reduced frustration: dont have to start over againjust fix the part dont like (P4). Compared to Stage 1, where small sketch changes could lead to unrelated alterations, Stage 3s refinement preserved coherence and increased trust in the system. Preferred Strategies. Different editing strategies were observed. Some participants (P3, P5, P7) intervened early, pausing the video within the first few seconds to adjust motions before they propagated. Others (P1, P2, P8) preferred to watch complete draft first and then make targeted corrections. These choices also influenced how edits were sequenced. For instance, as shown in Fig. 10, P8 ensured that the overall structure of the neural network animation was correct before refining details such as layer-wise flow and color changes, describing the process as just small fixes once it was understood. In contrast, P5 followed step-by-step approach, editing the rockets trajectory and fall before addressing the explosion and pacing, noting preference to go scene by scene. Strategy selection was shaped not only by personal preference but also by the nature of the task and the systems prior knowledge. In P8s case, the VLM correctly recognized the rough sketch as fully connected network and applied concepts such as backpropagation, which made the creation process more automatic and reduced the need for lowlevel specification. As P8 remarked, it felt like the system already knows what mean, which shaped his choice to focus on high-level adjustments rather than redrawing details. User Perception of Control. Seven out of eight participants reported that refinement cues gave them stronger sense of control than in previous stages. They valued being able to tell the AI exactly whats wrong, instead of hoping it guesses right (P7). This contributed to perceived shift from one-shot generation to an iterative, collaborative process. However, two participants also tested the system with higher-level semantic requests (e.g., make this look more natural), which were not successfully interpreted. These limitations revealed boundaries of the refinement mechanism: while effective for concrete spatial-temporal edits, it struggled with abstract stylistic or semantic adjustments. Nonetheless, participants widely agreed that refinement cues transformed the interaction into more predictable and empowering authoring experience."

Bottom: corresponding output video frames. systems attempt to address this by increasing output diversity, they often lack precise alignment with user intentions due to limited vision-language understanding capabilities. Other systems rely on complex, multi-step prompt engineering workflows to help users refine their ideas, but these often interrupt the creative flow. We argue that sketching provides lightweight and effective medium for expressing and gradually refining animation intent. Prior systems, such as K-Sketch [14], have highlighted that traditional animation tools are often too complex for novices due to their emphasis on frame-by-frame control. In contrast, simple sketches can allow users to communicate temporal dynamics without extensive effort, making the process significantly more accessible. In our exploration, users can either draw rough sketches from scratch or annotate on top of generated results. This supports more fluid, back-and-forth interaction with the VLM understanding and generation. For example, during Stage 3 of our study, users often began sketching without clear goal in mind. It was only when presented with clarification cuessuch as candidate suggestions or disambiguation optionsthat they began to consciously shape their intent. This observation echoes findings from recent work like AnyAni [54], where novice users struggled to articulate animation needs and required iterative refinement through system feedback. Crucially, we avoid traditional end-to-end generation pipeline in which the AI produces complete result in one shot, leaving little room for user intervention. Instead, we preserve the opportunity for users to continually influence and reinterpret how the AI understands their sketches. This not only allows users to refine the output but also helps them reflect on and reshape their own ideas. Through this iterative, co-creative loop, the final animation gradually emergesbalancing the strengths of both human intuition and AI generation."

            "content": "low-level sketches, such as precise motion paths or data diagrams, when finer control was needed. Because our system relies primarily on the reasoning capabilities of VLMs, it was more effective at interpreting high-level sketches that conveyed semantic intent, while its ability to handle low-level details was less consistent. In practice, this meant that abstract annotations were readily understood, substantially lowering the entry barrier for novice users [13, 14], whereas capturing accurate shapes or trajectories often depended on chance alignment with the models visual interpretation. More generally, the two levels demand different forms of technical support. Low-level sketches require specialized algorithms to preserve geometric fidelity and temporal precision, as in ControlNet [74], whereas high-level semantics benefit more from the broad reasoning capacities of VLMs [46]. Future work should explore hybrid authoring workflows that fluidly integrate both modalities. Adaptive systems that allow users to begin with high-level, accessible annotations and selectively refine with low-level precision sketches could enable smooth transitions between rapid ideation and detailed specification, aligning authoring effort with creative goals. In our analysis, we found participants used two main ways to sketch dynamic intent. The first was in-image motion annotations, where they drew arrows, motion curves, or ghosted outlines directly onto single frame. This was concise way to define specific trajectory or transformation. The second was across-frame sequencing, the classic storyboard method where they conveyed motion by drawing successive keyframes. This approach naturally encoded temporal evolution and was better for showing complex compositional changes. This duality reflects clear trade-off between efficiency and precision. In-image annotations were fast and preferred for simple translations or rotations. Sequencing, while more work, offered far more control over timing and complex interactions. Interestingly, each mode created unique problems for the VLM. frame crowded with in-image annotations could become mess of conflicting cues. Yet with sequencing, if the temporal gap between two frames was too large, the model might misinterpret single moving element as two completely separate objects.

Sketch2Anim: Towards Transferring Sketch Storyboards into 3D Animation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.19189 (2025). SketchDynamics: Exploring Free-Form Sketches for Dynamic Intent Expression in Animation Generation CHI 26, April 1317, 2026, Barcelona, Spain User Rating in Three Stages Fig. 12 illustrates the cumulative benefit of our design interventions across the three stages. We observe substantial upward trend in Alignment and Control, shifting from predominantly negative ratings in Stage 1 to highly positive ones in Stage 3. This validates that while the VLM alone (Stage 1) often struggles with interpretation, the integration of clarification and refinement effectively bridges the gulf between user intent and system output. Notably, despite the additional interaction steps introduced in the final system, Effort ratings improved compared to Stage 1. This suggests that users perceived the targeted refinement process as significantly less laborious and frustrating than the repetitive trial-and-error redrawing required in the baseline. Furthermore, Flow and Ease remained consistently high, indicating that the added mechanisms were seamlessly integrated without disrupting the creative momentum. Visual Understanding Capability Experiment Before the main study, we conducted pilot tests to check feasibility, focusing on prompt design and the VLMs ability to interpret freeform sketches. The results were encouraging: the prompts guided the model effectively, and the VLM showed strong potential in handling abstract input. Here we show how the VLM with prompt engineering interpreted several Stage 1 sketches, illustrating how rough or symbolic drawings were mapped into animation concepts. This is not part of our core contribution but serves as an important foundation for the paper. User Study Survey and Interview Questions This appendix provides the detailed instruments used in our threestage user study to evaluate SketchDynamics. These include the participant background survey, the post-task Likert scale questionnaire, and the semi-structured interview guide. C.1 Pre-study Questionnaire: Background and"

Ease: The interface was easy to use and understand. Flow: The workflow felt smooth without disrupting my creative process. Control: felt in control of how my input was interpreted. Effort: The effort required to use the system was reasonable. Explore: The system encouraged me to try new ways of expressing my ideas. Semi-structured Interview Guide C.3 The following questions guided our qualitative analysis across the three stages of the study: C.3.1 General Questions (All Stages). What was your primary strategy for translating animation ideas into free-form sketches? Were there specific animation intents that you found particularly difficult to express through sketching? Did the systems interpretation of your sketches surprise you? In what way? C.3.2 Stage 2: Clarification Cues. How did you perceive the clarification requests (e.g., multiplechoice, fill-value)? Did they feel like interruptions or helpful checks? Did the clarification process help you better define animation details (like timing or speed) that you hadnt initially considered?. C.3.3 Stage 3: Refinement Cues. How does the experience of refining generated video compare to redrawing storyboard from scratch? Did the ability to edit specific video frames increase your sense of control over the AI collaborator? Which did you find more useful for refinement: drawing on the frame or providing text prompts? Why? Demographics: Age, Gender, and Handedness. Motion Graphics Experience: How often do you watch motion graphics or explainer videos? (1: Never, 7: Daily). Have you ever created motion graphics using tools such as After Effects, CapCut, or others? Rate your proficiency in video editing and animation software (1: Novice, 7: Expert). Sketching Experience: How often do you use sketching for ideation or communication? (1: Never, 7: Daily). Rate your comfort level with drawing/sketching (1: Very Uncomfortable, 7: Very Comfortable).
