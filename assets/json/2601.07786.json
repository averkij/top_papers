While these systems increase productivity, they also introduce novel forms of risk and uncertainty. Developers must evaluate, correct, and maintain code partially written by non-human agents. Code comments, particularly those that self-admit technical shortcomings, offer unique window into how developers interpret and manage AI-assisted contributions. In software engineering, self-admitted technical debt (SATD) signals areas requiring future improvement. When such comments reference LLMs, they reveal not only perceived code deficiencies but also evolving conceptions of accountability between human and machine collaborators. Figure 1 shows one such example, where developer notes that function was generated by Gemini and remains unfinished, illustrating how AI involvement and deferred implementation converge to create potential debt. While prior research has established taxonomies and automated methods for identifying SATD [2, 3, 20, 25, 26], little is known about how technical debt manifests in code influenced by generative AI. Early studies on AI-assisted development highlight productivity benefits [4, 8], but also point to challenges of correctness, explainability, and trust. What remains unclear is how developers themselves recognize and document these challenges in practice, and whether AI involvement reshapes the kinds of debt that are self-admitted during development. This study explores SATD in the context of generative AI-assisted software development. By analyzing code comments that explicitly reference both LLM use and technical debt markers, we investigate how developers identify and articulate shortcomings in AI-generated code. Specifically, we ask: RQ1: What types of self-admitted technical debt emerge in developer comments that acknowledge both LLM involvement and technical debt? We observed that developers most frequently report Design Debt (33/81), followed by Requirement Debt (17/81) and Test Debt (17/81). Compared to prior SATD distributions, design-related issues are proportionally lower, while requirement and testing debts are higher, indicating that AI-assisted development tends to shift self-admitted Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Abdullah Al Mujahid and Mia Mohammad Imran debt toward later development stages, particularly requirement completion and validation activities. RQ2: How do developers attribute the role of AI in generativeAI induced SATDs? We found that developers often attribute AI-assisted code as trigger for potential issues, expressing uncertainty about its completeness and correctness and noting the need for more verification or revision (34/81 cases). In several instances, developers hold AIassisted code responsible for errors, redundant logic, or unstable behavior that must be resolved later (22/81 cases). At the same time, they also recognize AI assistance as beneficial for improving, refining, or validating existing implementations which contributes to resolving existing technical debts (19/81 cases). Our findings show that AI-assisted development reshapes the distribution of technical debt, with fewer design-related issues but higher prevalence of requirement and testing debts. Beyond these shifts, we identify distinct form of debt is emerging when AIgenerated code is adopted without full developer understanding or confidence. We term this GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that systematically examines self-admitted technical debt explicitly linked to generative AI usage in source code comments. Looking ahead, our work posits several directions to examine how AI involvement influences the emergence and evolution of technical debt across the software development life cycle (SDLC), and how development tools or team practices might adapt to identify, document, and manage these AI-related debts more effectively.

            "content": "(GIST) We observed recurring pattern that developers are integrating AIassisted code into their production codebases despite i) uncertainty about its correctness, and ii) limited understanding of its internal logic. We introduce this notion as conceptual interpretation grounded in observed self-admitted comments. This pattern appears across multiple SATD types discussed in Section 3.2.1. For example, TODO: Fix the Mess Gemini Created: Towards Understanding GenAI-Induced Self-Admitted Technical Debt Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA in the comment, TODO: Copilot suggested this function (I have no clue what the regex is doing), the developer acknowledges incorporating an AI-generated function without understanding its behavior. Similarly, TODO: This is totally GPT generated and Im not sure it works expresses uncertainty about correctness, and TODO: generated by ChatGPT, dont know how reasonable this is reflects doubt about the plausibility of the AI output. Collectively, these comments illustrate recurring form of uncertainty-driven technical debt that we refer to as GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST). The observed pattern is consistent with prior work on automation bias, where developers rely on automated suggestions despite uncertainty about their correctness or rationale [1, 27]. Research in human-AI interaction has shown that such reliance can influence judgment, verification behavior, and trust in automated systems [1, 27, 33]. In our study, we observe how automation-related uncertainty is documented as self-admitted technical debt in source code comments. GIST characterizes situations in which uncertainty about AIgenerated code is not immediately resolved but instead deferred, creating latent burden for future development and maintenance. This form of debt manifests through two recurring dimensions: Knowledge Deficit and Deferred Quality Assurance: Developers integrate AI-generated code without full understanding of its underlying logic or correctness, creating gap between the artifact and their mental model of the system. This partial comprehension often leads to postponed validation or testing, as developers defer closer examination to later stage. Such deferral constitutes cognitive form of technical debt: understanding is temporarily outsourced to the AI, leaving uncertainty that may resurface during maintenance or modification. Lack of Trust and Delegated Responsibility: Developers uncertainty about the reliability or rationale of AI-generated code may erode their confidence in the system as whole. To manage this uncertainty, responsibility for verifying or improving the AIs output is implicitly shifted to other team members or future revisions. This delegation reflects an operational dimension of GIST, where provisional integration of AI output allows unverified code to persist, creating ambiguity around ownership and long-term accountability."
