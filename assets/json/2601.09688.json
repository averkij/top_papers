            "content": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has initiated significant shift in AI capabilities, moving from passive text generation toward the development of agentic systems capable of tackling complex real-world tasks (Liu et al., 2025; Kimi et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025; Gemini, 2025; OpenAI, 2025a). Within this broader transition toward agentic intelligence, deep research systems have emerged as Corresponding Author 1 Figure 1: Overview of deep research systems performance on our benchmark. The upper section reports quality evaluation results across deep research systems, with Gemini2.5-Pro achieving the highest score (8.51/10). The bottom section reports factual correctness, where Manus achieves the highest ratio of correct statements (82.3%). one of the representative paradigms (OpenAI, 2025b; Gemini, 2025; Team et al., 2025; Perplexity, 2025). They autonomously conduct investigative processes that involve iterative web browsing, targeted information retrieval, cross-source verification, and multiperspective synthesis. Through this structured workflow, deep research systems ultimately generate comprehensive, citation-grounded reports that traditionally require substantial human effort, e.g., Please review AI compute investments in 2025 and looking ahead to the trends of 2026. With the transition of the technological paradigm, evaluating long reports generated by deep research systems poses key challenge, as it differs subSeveral stantially from conventional QA tasks. benchmarks have been proposed to assess long-form, research-style outputs, however most existing benchmarks suffer from three limitations: i) they rely on expert-driven task construction, which is annotationintensive (Yao et al., 2025; Du et al., 2025; Abaskohi et al., 2025; Gou et al., 2025); ii) they employ static quality evaluation dimensions shared across tasks (Fan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025); and iii) they verify only citation-linked statements for factuality, leaving uncited factual claims unexamined (Du et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2025; Gou et al., 2025). To bridge these gaps, we present DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. To address the scarcity of high-quality deep research tasks and the high cost of expert annotation, we propose persona-driven pipeline, which constructs tasks anchored in specific personas, ensuring realistic needs and high complexity. We then apply the Task Qualification Filter that assesses whether task truly requires up-to-date evidence aggregation and multi-source investigation, and the Search Necessity Filter that discards simple questions solvable using an LLMs internal parametric knowledge. As result, we retain 100 persona-driven, high-quality deep research tasks across multiple domains. On the evaluation side, we develop an agentic evaluation pipeline with two key components. (i) Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation preserves fixed set of general evaluation dimensions shared across all tasks, while additionally generating task-specific dimensions, criteria, and corresponding weights for each task, allowing fine-grained and interpretable scoring tailored to individual deep research tasks. (ii) Active Fact-Checking performs active verification: it extracts verifiable statements (e.g., numbers, events, dates, entities), retrieves external evidence, and assigns structured labels (Right/Wrong/Unknown), thereby enabling factual verification of both cited and uncited claims. While factual correctness is an inherently core component of overall report quality, we treat it as standalone evaluation module due to its distinct verification process, which requires external evidence retrieval, and its critical role in ensuring the reliability of deep research reports. We apply our framework to evaluate leading deep research systems, spanning proprietary generalpurpose systems (e.g., Gemini Deep Research (Gemini, 2025), OpenAI Deep Research (OpenAI, 2025b)), and agentic generalists with deep research capabilities (e.g., Manus (Manus, 2025)). In total, we evaluate 900 deep research reports, comprising 100 tasks per system across 9 deep research systems. As shown in Figure 1, our comprehensive evaluation reveals clear strengths and weaknesses across different dimensions of deep research capability. Gemini Deep Research achieve the strongest performance in report quality evaluation, reflecting superior coverage, insight, and structural coherence. Manus and Gemini Deep Research attain the highest scores in factual evaluation, showing stronger robustness against hallucinations and citation errors during complex multisource report synthesis. Additionally, we observe consistent gap between general and task-specific evaluation: across all systems, task-specific scores are systematically lower than those on fixed general dimensions. This gap indicates that current deep research systems often fail to meet task-specific success criteria, motivating task-adaptive evaluation beyond fixed general dimensions, precisely what our benchmark is designed to capture."

The emergence of deep research systems has motivated broad range of benchmarks targeting different agentic capabilities (Gou et al., 2025; Mialon et al., 2024; Phan et al., 2025; Du et al., 2025; Wong et al., 2025; Wan et al., 2025; Abaskohi et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Lei et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025; Han et al., 2025). Early benchmarks such as GAIA (Mialon et al., 2024) and Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025) focus on general reasoning and tool use, while others emphasize persistent web navigation and retrieval, including WideSearch (Wong et al., 2025) and BrowseComp variants (Wei et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025). More recent benchmarks move toward report-level evaluation, including DeepResearch Bench (Du et al., 2025), LiveResearchBench (Wang et al., 2025), and DRBench (Abaskohi et al., 2025); however, they remain annotation-intensive, rely on fixed task-agnostic evaluation dimensions, and often restrict factual verification to cited statements, leaving uncited claims unchecked. In contrast, DeepResearchEval introduces an automated framework for task construction and agentic evaluation. As summarized in Table 1, it uniquely combines automatic task generation, reference-free evaluation, adaptive task-specific quality dimensions, and active fact verification over both cited and uncited statements for deep research systems."

To address these limitations, we introduce an automated persona-driven deep research task collection pipeline that mirrors real-world production workflows. As shown in Figure 2, we generate diverse personas conditioned on specific domains, which serve as seeds to produce expertise-aligned tasks, followed by multiple quality filtering stages to ensure high-quality final set of deep research tasks.

To ensure our evaluation covers diverse spectrum of real-world information needs, we draw upon the domain taxonomy defined in (Wettig et al., 2025) and curate ten representative categories specifically suitable for deep research tasks, forming domain set that encompasses: Transportation, Politics, Finance & Business, History, Software Development, Industrial, Sports & Fitness, Health, Science & Technology, and Education & Jobs. For each domain D, we prompt an LLM to generate personas that are closely related to the domain while exhibiting diverse backgrounds. Each persona is specified by attributes including affiliation, role, background, name, and subdomain. We generate five personas per domain, resulting in total set of 50 personas. Task Construction. For each persona , we prompt an LLM to generate candidate deep research tasks conditioned on the personas background. To ensure high task complexity, we enforce generation 3 Figure 2: The proposed three-stage pipeline for constructing persona-driven deep research tasks. schema requiring: (i) multi-round web searches; (ii) integration of evidence from diverse sources (e.g., papers, reports, and forums); (iii) sufficient analytical depth covering recent developments, data analysis, trend assessment, and comparative analysis; and (iv) concrete deliverables with explicit time constraints and 1050 word descriptions. We generate four tasks per persona, yielding total set of 200 candidates. Task Filtering. To further ensure the quality of our benchmark, we employ two-stage filtering pipeline for the candidate deep research tasks: Task Qualification Filter and Search Necessity Filter. Task Qualification Filter: This distinguishes deep research tasks from simple tasks. An LLM-based evaluator assesses candidates on four criteria: requirement for up-to-date knowledge, multi-source evidence integration, multi-layered in-depth investigation, and personas background and expertise alignment. Only tasks with confidence score > 0.7 are retained. Search Necessity Filter: To exclude tasks solvable by internal knowledge, an LLM attempts each retained task using only parametric knowledge (no external tools). separate evaluator assesses this non-search baseline across dimensions like accuracy, depth, and timeliness, professionalism, and structure. Tasks achieving high quality scores without search are filtered out, resulting in 155 retained tasks. Human Verification of Retained Tasks. To validate the automated pipeline, we invited seven domain experts holding Ph.D. degrees to independently evaluate the 155 retained tasks against deep research criteria, including multi-round search, multi-source Table 2: Distribution of expert approval counts for the 155 retained tasks."

As illustrated in Figure 4, the pipeline comprises two components: (1) an adaptive point-wise quality evaluator that actively derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and relative weights conditioned on the given research task, enabling fine-grained and 4 Agentic Quality Evaluation Framework. Formally, for given task t, the evaluator first defines four general evaluation dimensions Dgeneral: Coverage, Insight, Instruction-following, and Clarity, capturing essential report qualities applicable across tasks. Dimension definitions are provided in Appendix D.1. Then the evaluator generates set of task-specific dimensions Dtask, tailored to task t. For instance, in task that compares policies across different countries and requires the specification of quantitative indicators, the task-specific dimensions include Metric Utility and Comparative Synthesis, which are important evaluation metrics in political analysis but may not apply to more general tasks (see Appendix for an example). The full dimension set is: = Dgeneral Dtask, The evaluator assigns normalized weight Wd to each dimension such that (cid:80) dD Wd = 1, where higher weights indicate greater importance of dimension for evaluating the task. For each dimension d, set of criteria {c} are generated along with their corresponding weights wd,c, where (cid:80) wd,c = 1. Given report R, the evaluator scores each criterion on scale of [1, 10]: sd,c = LLMθ(R, c) , sd,c [1, 10], (1) The final evaluation score for task is computed as: Squality = (cid:88) dD (cid:88) Wd wd,c sd,c. (2) The evaluator generates task-specific overall quality score, offering greater relevance to the evaluation context. Furthermore, it enables granular analysis of individual dimensions and criteria, ensuring more comprehensive understanding of report quality. Details on prompts, LLM configurations, and full dimension set, dimension-level weights, criteria, and criterion-level weights can be found in Appendix D.1."

            "title": "4.1 Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation",
            "content": "The deep research system produces long-form reports that vary substantially across tasks and domains, making it insufficient to evaluate all outputs using fixed and uniform rubric. Prior work (Du et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2025) typically relies on small set of pre-defined dimensions, which limits their ability to reflect task-specific evaluation aspects. Meanwhile, manually constructing customized rubrics for each task (Gou et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025) is labor-intensive and does not scale. To address these challenges, as illustrated in Figure 4, we propose an adaptive point-wise quality evaluation framework. For each task, the evaluator combines fixed set of general dimensions with automatically generated task-specific dimensions, and assigns normalized weights to all dimensions to reflect their relative importance. Each dimension is further instantiated with weighted evaluation criteria, enabling fine-grained, criterion-level scoring. The final quality score is obtained by aggregating criterion scores within each dimension and then combining all dimensions according to their task-specific weights. 5 Figure 4: Overview of the proposed pipeline. (Top) Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation augments Dgeneral with task-specific Dtask. An LLM scores criteria sd,c, aggregating them into Squality via weights Wd and wd,c. (Bottom) Active Fact-Checking extracts statements Si from report segments {pi}. An agent verifies claims using MCP-based retrieval, producing JSON labels (Right, Wrong, Unknown). citations; ii) claims appear in uncited segments; and (iii) citation-based verification checks whether cited source supports claim, rather than its factual correctness. To address these issues, we propose an active fact checking framework that actively retrieves and examines external evidence to assess the factual consistency of the entire report, as shown in Figure 4. Agentic Fact-Checking Framework. Built upon MiroFlow (MiroMind, 2025), our agent iteratively invokes MCP tools to retrieve external evidence. Rather than relying solely on citations, it proactively identifies and verifies claims to ensure comprehensive statement-level checking. Given generated report that requires factual evaluation, our fact-checking agent follows structured, multi-stage pipeline to support fine-grained, statement-level verification of long-form reports. To reduce the challenges associated with long-context processing in lengthy reports and to enable parallel verification across segments, the agent first segments into set of smaller parts = {p1, p2, . . . , pN }, For each input part pi, the agent extracts set of statements Si = {si1, si2, . . . } involving verifiable entities such as numbers, news, events, dates, locations, or people. For each statement Si, the agent invokes retrieval tool to search the web and collect relevant evidence E(s). Although verification is performed at the statement level, the agent holds the full segment context pi as well as the associated deep research task, enabling context-aware and task-consistent judgments. Based on the consistency between and the retrieved evidence, the agent assigns one of three labels: y(s) {Right, Wrong, Unknown}. Right denotes support, Wrong indicates contradiction, and Unknown marks insufficient evidence, explicitly distinguishing unverifiable claims from errors. Results, including labels, evidence, and reasoning, are returned in JSON format. Implementation details and examples are in Appendix D.2 and G. Finally, the Ratio metric of factual evaluation is defined as the proportion of right statements over all statements: Ratio = NRight NStatements ."

We observe clear stratification: Gemini-2.5-Pro Deep Research achieves the highest average score (8.51) and leads across all dimensions, followed by Claude-Sonnet-4.5 Deep Research (7.53). This advantage is driven by Coverage, Insight, and Instruction-following, where these top systems exceed 8.5, indicating strong abilities in information gathering, synthesis, and execution of complex instructions. DeepSeek and Manus show moderate Instructionfollowing (7.2, 8.3) but lag in Coverage and Insight, resulting in lower overall scores (5.25, 5.95). Perplexity and Grok4 improve substantially in Coverage (> 8.2) and Instruction-following (9.3, 9.6), reflecting stronger retrieval and planning. Doubao and Qwen-3-235B-A22B further enhance analytical depth, with Qwen achieving high Insight score of 7.9. Finally, OpenAI and Claude-Sonnet-4.5 exhibit balanced performance across dimensions. Notably, task-specific scores are consistently lower than general scores across all systems. This indicates that while systems excel at general synthesis, they often fail to optimize for task-specific criteria. This gap motivates our adaptive dimensions, which capture quality aspects missed by fixed rubrics. Ultimately, generating high-quality task-specific content remains key challenge for current deep research systems. Factual Evaluation. Table 4 presents factual evaluation results where our agent assesses statements per report. We report average checkable Statements and counts for Right, Wrong, and Unknown claims (defined in Sec. 4.2). Models are ranked in ascending order by factual Ratio. Top performers like Manus, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek achieve ratios > 76%, indicating superior reliability. In contrast, Perplexity and Claude-Sonnet4.5 exhibit lower ratios, implying more unverifiable or incorrect statements. Substantial variation exists in statement volume: Gemini-2.5-Pro and Doubao produce notably more claims (86.99, 80.75), yielding denser reports, whereas DeepSeek adopts conservative strategy (25.08). These results suggest potential trade-off between maintaining high factual accuracy and increasing the volume of reported statements.

Our personadriven task construction enables generation of realistic, complex tasks without manual annotation. We propose an adaptive point-wise quality evaluation for report assessment, together with an active factchecking via external evidence retrieval. Experiments on nine deep research systems reveal substantial performance differences, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework in evaluating generated long report."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Despite its effectiveness, the proposed framework has several practical limitations. The current implementation is largely English-centric: although the persona-driven task construction and adaptive evaluation mechanisms are language-agnostic, the benchmark tasks, evidence sources, and reporting pipelines are grounded in English-speaking information ecosystems. As result, performance in multilingual settings and the ability to synthesize evidence across diverse languages remain unexplored. In addition, the agentic evaluation pipeline incurs substantial computational and financial costs. The framework relies on frequent interactions with frontier models, using Gemini-2.5-Pro for quality scoring and GPT-5-mini for factual verification, alongside extensive Google Serper API usage. While the fact checking agents multi turn, tool intensive design enables high evaluation depth, it constrains scalability Zijian Chen, Xueguang Ma, Shengyao Zhuang, Ping Nie, Kai Zou, Andrew Liu, Joshua Green, Kshama Patel, Ruoxi Meng, Mingyi Su, and 1 others. 2025.

The model is used with default temperature settings, maximum of 128K new tokens, 190K maximum context length, top-p = 1.0, and top-k = 1. For retrieval, we use the Google Serper API to conduct searches and scrape website content. The number of returned results is set to 10, with maximum of 5 retry attempts. For our agent workflow, we set the maximum number of turns to 30, with up to 10 tool calls allowed per turn. The agent interacts with the MCP server tool-search. The MCP tools available on the tool-search server mainly include google_search() for search, scrape_website() for retrieving webpage content, and wiki_get_page_content() for obtaining content from specific Wikipedia pages corresponding to target entities. Active Fact-checking Prompt. We present the prompt used to segment Deep Research report into multiple paragraphs, after which each paragraph is independently evaluated by fact-checking agent. We further show the agent system prompt used in the 14 MiroFlow framework, along with the task description prompt for fact-checking. Finally, summary prompt aggregates the evaluations into structured JSONformatted result."

Reasoning: The arXiv paper reports 2.788M H800 GPU hours (i.e., approximately 2.788 million hours). The statement incorrectly uses 2,788M, which implies 2,788 million (i.e., 2.788 billion) GPU hours, introducing threeorders-of-magnitude unit error. In addition, the $5.6M figure is community-derived estimate based on assumed GPU hourly costs, rather than training cost explicitly reported in the paper. Therefore, the claim as written is incorrect. Evidence: arXiv: Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training.

Case 2 Statement The FIBA Europe Coaching Certificate (FECC), two-year, mentorship-intensive program run by elite European coaches, is specifically designed to elevate the knowledge base of coaches working with players aged 1520. Model Response Verification: Unknown. Reasoning: The FIBA Europe Coaching Certificate (FECC) is real and highly regarded coaching program focused on the development of youth coaches in Europe. Publicly available sources confirm its prestige and its emphasis on developing coaches working with young players. However, descriptions of the program vary regarding its duration, with some sources referring to three-year structure, and publicly available materials do not consistently substantiate the precise phrasing two-year, mentorship-intensive nor explicitly specify target player age range of 1520. Due to these inconsistencies and insufficient public detail, the exact claim cannot be fully verified. Evidence: FIBA Europe: The FIBA Europe Coaching Certificate (FECC) program has established its position as one of the most prestigious coaching programs in European sport. FIBA Europe Coaching: The graduates from the FECC will receive an extremely rare and valuable qualification and they are FIBA Europe approved coaches for developing young players. African Sports Monthly: The exclusive 18 three-year coaching program, which focuses on the development of young players, has limited intake of 60 up-and-coming European coaches...

However, official descriptions do not explicitly specify player age range of 1520, and the program duration is described inconsistently across sources. As result, the claim cannot be fully verified and is appropriately classified as Unknown. Correct Case 3 Statement European Union: Dutch and EU-wide measures broadened controls on advanced lithography and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (e.g., immersion DUV tools, EUV pellicles). Model Response Verification: Unknown. Reasoning: Public documentation from the Dutch government and ASML confirms that the Netherlands expanded export license requirements on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, notably including immersion DUV lithography tools, in September 2024. However, no publicly available primary EU regulatory documents were found that explicitly demonstrate an EU-wide measure adding EUV pellicles to the EU dual-use export control list by the relevant time frame. Because the statement jointly attributes such controls to both Dutch national measures and EU-wide actions, including EUV pellicles, the combined claim cannot be fully verified. Evidence: Government of the Netherlands: As of 7 September 2024, the national export control measure applicable to advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment will be expanded."
