BACKGROUND Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed globally, with an estimated 1.5 million new diagnoses in 2022 alone, according to the World Health Organization [1]. Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, alone accounted for 330,000 new diagnoses and 60,000 deaths that same year. With the incidence rate of skin cancers rising driven by factors including but not limited to: ageing populations, rising life expectancy, increased sun exposure, and environmental factors [2], [3], the incidence rate of melanoma is projected to double every 10-20 years [4]. This burgeoning global burden of skin diseases, estimated to be over 42 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) in 2019 [5], coupled with projections of declining dermatologist-to-population ratio [6], strongly motivates the research and development of automated methods for dermatological image analysis.

            "title": "Segmentation of skin lesions is a crucial",
            "content": "Dermoscopy is widely-used non-invasive imaging technique for the examination of pigmented skin lesions, allowing clinicians to visualize both morphological surface features and subsurface structures otherwise obscured to the naked eye [16][18]. Studies have shown that when used by trained experts, dermoscopy significantly improves both the sensitivity [19], [20] and specificity [21], [22] of melanoma diagnosis. Dermoscopy has also been the target modality for automated skin image analysis. For example, almost 3 decades ago, Binder et al. [23] used artificial neural networks for detecting malignant melanomas from dermoscopic skin lesion images. task in the automated skin lesion image analysis pipeline. Rule-based diagnosis clinical prediction rules, including the most widely used [24], [25] ABCD (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Differential structure) [26], rely on an accurate delineation of the skin lesion boundary. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based skin image analysis methods rely on segmentation either as an end-goal, an intermediate task (e.g., analyzing wide-field images, tracking the evolution of skin lesions, removing imaging artifacts, and enhancing the interpretability of DL models), or as benchmark for evaluating massive foundation models [27], [28]. We direct the interested reader to comprehensive surveys on automated skin image analysis in general [29] and DLbased skin lesion segmentation (SLS) in particular [30]. However, although crucial, SLS remains challenging task due 2025. This manuscript version is made available under the arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license 1.0. to the presence of imaging artifacts (e.g., hair, gel bubbles, dark corners), lesion size and shape variability, varying skin tones, variable contrast and illumination, and ambiguous lesion boundaries [30], all of which affect the annotation of true ground truth segmentation. This variability in medical image segmentation, including in skin lesion images, is an active area of research, spanning several related yet distinct goals: studying variability in expert segmentations [31][35], aggregating multiple segmentations to model single gold standard segmentation [36][41], learning to model individual annotator-specific segmentation preferences [15], [42], [43], modeling the underlying distribution of segmentations [44] [47] and discovering the underlying segmentation styles [48], among others. Table lists all the publicly available SLS datasets, spanning the two popular skin imaging modalities: dermoscopic and clinical. Existing datasets sizes vary from little as 200 images (PH2 [9]) to just over 10,000 images (HAM100000 [14]), but despite the inherit ambiguity in segmentation, all these datasets contain only one segmentation mask per image. There is only one SLS dataset that contains multiple annotations per image: ISIC 2019-Seg [15], but with only 3 segmentations for each of its 100 images, it is quite small for effectively modeling annotator-specific tasks, especially compared to multiannotator datasets from other medical imaging modalities such as CT (e.g., LIDC-IDRI [49]) and fundus photography (e.g., RIGA [50]). The ISIC Archive, maintained by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), hosts the worlds largest collection of digital skin images. At the time of writing this article, the ISIC Archive contains over 1.2 million images, of which more than 120,000 are publicly available dermoscopic images. The Archive also contains subsets that were released as part of ISICs Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Segmentation Challenges over the years (20162018). In fact, recent survey by Mirikharaji et al. [30] found that of the 177 papers on SLS that they reviewed, 168 (95%) of the papers used at least one ISIC dataset, underlining the importance of the ISIC Archive to the skin image analysis community. Motivated by the lack of large multi-annotator SLS datasets and the popularity of ISIC Archive, we collect and publicly release ISIC MultiAnnot++ (IMA++ hereafter). With 14,967 images segmented by 16 annotators, the IMA++ contains total of 17,684 segmentations. Of these 14,967 images, 2,394 have at least 2 segmentations per image. To the best of our knowledge, IMA++ is the largest publicly available skin lesion segmentation dataset, multi-annotator or otherwise. Additionally, to establish segmentation consensus for images that have multiple segmentations, we also include segmentation masks using two consensus algorithms, increasing the number of segmentations to 22,472. The IMA++ dataset presents the following meritorious properties: Inter-annotator variability: IMA++ captures wide range of segmentation styles, reflecting differences in annotator preferences, tools used, and manual review process (varying skill levels). Realistic multi-annotator scenario: Most multiimage segmentation datasets [49], annotator medical 2 Fig. 1. breakdown of the IMA++ dataset: (a) distribution of number of segmentations per image and annotation factor-wise segmentation counts: (b) annotator, (c) tool, and (d) skill level. every image segmented by every [51][55] have thus forming complete bipartite graph annotator, between the set of images and the set of annotators. IMA++, on the other hand, real-world annotation scenarios where multiple annotators contribute images, and therefore features an to subset of incomplete bipartite graph. This means that every image in IMA++ is segmented by at least one annotator, but not all images are segmented by all annotators. simulates Tool-specific segmentation styles: Because of the availability of tool and skill level information for the segmentations, IMA++ allows for the exploration of how variations in these often-overlooked factors affect segmentation variability. These features make IMA++ an extremely valuable dataset for researchers working on variety of open problems including: (1) skin lesion image classification; (2) skin lesion segmentation, e.g., multi-annotator segmentation preference modeling, multi-expert segmentation consensus modeling, learning the distribution of segmentations and discovering the underlying segmentation styles from multi-annotator masks, and studying inter-annotator agreement among experts; and, (3) multi-modal (dermoscopic images and rich metadata) and multi-task (diagnosis, segmentation, IAA prediction) skin image analysis, and other tasks. Subsets of IMA++ have been used in two recent papers: (a) to evaluate the discovery of unique annotation segmentation styles in the absence of annotator-segmentation correspondence [48] and (b) to examine statistical association between the inter-annotator segmentation agreement levels (IAA hereafter) and the malignancy of skin lesions and to evaluate the feasibility of predicting IAA from skin lesion images directly without requiring any segmentations [56]. II. COLLECTION METHODS AND DESIGN A. Data Collection The ISIC Archive exposes public API for automated fetching of its contents. The images and raw segmentations in IMA++ are originally obtained from the ISIC Archive using the now-deprecated ISIC application programming interface (API) v1 [57]. The new ISIC API v2 [58] and its associated command line interface (CLI) [59], however, do not have endpoints for fetching segmentations. This leads to situation where although the images are available for download on the ISIC Archive, the corresponding segmentations or the segmentation-associated metadata are not currently available through the API, CLI, or web-interface. To address this gap, we gathered the complete list of segmentations and metadata by combining previously downloaded segmentations and by contacting sources to obtain the metadata for these masks, followed by anonymization and appropriate organization to build the IMA++ dataset. The scripts used for all the data collection, processing, and analysis are available on GitHub [60] at https://github.com/sfu-mial/IMAplusplus. B. Data Filtering As an initial quality control for the segmentation masks, we subject the masks to the following quality checks: empty masks (59), masks covering the entire image (3), and masks touching the image border (1,129). Of these checks, only empty masks i.e., masks that do not have any object (lesion) pixels, affect the utility, and therefore we remove these masks from our dataset. Similarly, we checked for images with missing metadata and found 59 images to not have any associated metadata. For IMA++ to be truly useful as multimodal dataset, all images contained therein should have metadata (Table II). Therefore, we remove these images, and finally, we are left with 14,967 images that have between 2 and 5 segmentations per image, resulting in 17,684 segmentation masks in total. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of segmentations per image in the IMA++ dataset. Of the 14,967 images, 12,573 have one segmentation mask per image, whereas the remaining 2,394 have multiple segmentations, leading to total of (12, 573 1) + (2130 2) + (209 3) + (51 4) + (4 5)=17,684 segmentations. C. Data Processing Next, we process the segmentation masks and their metadata (Table III). First, we assign unique identifiers to the three 3 annotation factors that determine the variability in the segmentation masks: annotator, tool, and skill level of the manual reviewer. Annotator mapping: We sort the annotators in decreasing order of the number of segmentation masks produced, and assign them unique identifiers accordingly: {A00, ..., A15}. Tool mapping: IMA++ contains three different tools that were used to draw the segmentation masks, and we assign them the following tool IDs: T1: manual polygon tracing by human expert, T2: semi-automated flood-fill with expert-defined parameters, and T3: fully-automated segmentation reviewed and accepted by human expert. Skill level mapping: Next, we have two skill levels of the manual reviewer: S1: expert and S2: novice. Finally, to avoid file corruption issues during data handling, we compute the MD5 hashes of the segmentation masks and add them to the metadata, so that users can verify data integrity. The counts of segmentations in IMA++ broken down by these three annotation factors is presented in Figure 1 (b, c, d). Similar to the number of segmentations per image, the annotator-segmentation counts also exhibit skewed distribution: six annotators (A00 A05) contribute approximately 78% of the segmentations (13,748 out of 17,684). Tools T1 and T3 account for 81% of the segmentations (14,247 out of 17,684), and 70% of the segmentations were manually reviewed by an S1 skill level reviewer (12,454 out of 17,684). D. Computing Segmentation Consensus Of the 14,967 images in the dataset, 2,394 images have multiple (2-5) annotations of the lesion segmentation per image. To compute consensus among these segmentations, as is standard for multi-annotator medical image segmentation challenges and datasets [54], [55], [61], [62], we employ two popular consensus algorithms: Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) [36] and majority voting using SimpleITKs STAPLEImageFilter and LabelVotingImageFilter, respectively. This allows us to study the agreement between the original annotations and the consensus masks w.r.t. the annotation factors (discussed later) and also allows usage of IMA++ for the training and evaluation of SLS models without multi-annotator set-ups. Figure 2 shows few representative samples from the IMA++ dataset, with two rows each for images with (from top to bottom) five, four, three, and two segmentations per image, respectively. For each of these sets of multi-annotator masks, the two consensus algorithms outputs are also shown: majority voting (MV) and STAPLE (ST). E. Data Splits While the availability of consensus masks allows IMA++ to be used for lesion diagnosis, single-segmentation-per-image SLS, and multi-modal multi-task set ups, the data preparation for multi-annotator segmentations is nuanced and requires Fig. 2. consensus segmentation masks computed using majority voting (MV) and STAPLE (ST). Sample image-segmentation pairs from IMA++: 2 rows each for images with {5, 4, 3, 2} segmentations per image along with the corresponding careful consideration while splitting the data into training, validation, and testing partitions. Therefore, we split the 2,394 images that have two or more segmentation masks per image stratified by 2 criteria: segmentation count per image: The proportions of images with {2, 3, 4, 5} segmentations per image are similar across the three partitions, yielding (1493, 144, 37, 1) with (2, 3, 4, 5) annotations in the training partition, with corresponding numbers being (214, 19, 6, 1) and (423, 46, 8, 2) in validation and testing partitions, respectively. inter-annotator agreement: We quantify the interannotator agreement (IAA) for each image by calculating the per-image averaged pairwise Dice coefficient between segmentation masks, and then categorize the images as having low IAA (i.e., Dice [0, 0.5)), medium IAA (i.e., Dice [0.5, 0.8]), or high IAA (i.e., Dice (0.8, 1.0]). We then use these IAA levels to stratify the splits, ensure that the proportions of these levels are similar across partitions. yielding (165, 403, 1107) images with (low, medium, high) IAA in the training partition, with corresponding numbers being (24, 58, 158) and (47, 115, 317) in validation and testing partitions, respectively. Based on these two criteria, we split the 2,394 images 5 Fig. 3. UpSet plot showing the distribution of segmentations across the 16 annotators (A00 A15).

These standardized data partitions for the multi-annotator segmentations of IMA++ allow researchers to systematically report and compare results across methods.

Visualizing annotator overlap We visualize the distribution of the segmentations across the 16 annotators using an UpSet plot [63] in Figure 3. We choose an UpSet plot because relationships among our 16 sets (16 annotators) are too complex to represent with Venn diagrams, which do not scale well beyond 3 sets. Co-occurence matrices are also insufficient, since they only describe pairwise interactions and do not reveal higher-order interactions across the rows correspond to multiple sets. In this UpSet plot, the number of segmentations generated by each of the 16 annotators (A00 A15). For each row, the cells (denoted by dots) that are part of set are filled in, and their counts are denoted by the respective bars along the columns on the top. If column has multiple cells that are filled in, they are connected with line and the column count denotes the size of the intersection of the corresponding sets. For example, the bottom row corresponds to the annotator A00. Traversing the bottom row shows that there are nine unique sets that A00s segmentation masks appear in: {A00}: 2,319 masks (2nd vertical bar at the top), {A00 A03}: 726 masks (7th vertical bar), {A00 A03 A08}: 91 masks, {A00 A09}: 68 masks, {A00 A08}: 39 masks, {A00 A06}: 35 masks, {A00 A08 A09}: 5 masks, {A00 A03 A09}: 2 masks, and {A00 A03 A06}: 1 mask. Since these are the segmentations that A00 contributed, their total 2, 319 + 726 + 91 + 68 + 39 + 35 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 3, 286 is indicated in the horizontal bar corresponding to A00 (along the bottom row). With 16 annotators, 216 1 unique non-empty intersections of annotators are possible. On the other hand, if the images were annotated in complete bipartite manner, only 1 unique intersection would be possible, i.e., all images would be segmented by all the annotators. We observe that with an incomplete bipartite annotation set-up, IMA++ has 57 unique annotator intersections, yielding rich variety of multiannotator interactions. B. Analyzing interand intra-factor agreement in IMA++ Studying the extent of (dis)agreement between annotators is commonly explored area with multi-annotator set-ups. For instance-level labels, this inter-rater agreement (IAA) is often measured using widely used statistics such as Cohens kappa, Krippendorffs alpha, and Fleiss kappa. For segmentation masks, however, IAA is measured by computing the similarity between the masks, generally using overlap-based (e.g., Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard index) or boundary-based (e.g., Hausdorff distance, boundary F1 score) measures. For our analysis of IMA++, we choose the most popular measure of each of these categories: Dice coefficient (DC) and 95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95). We extend our analysis beyond just annotators, and visualize these 7 Fig. 7. All images (n = 23) in IMA++ that have entirely non-overlapping segmentations (black and magenta contours) from multiple annotators. Best viewed online. similar pattern emerges when analyzing tools and skill levels. Notably, tools T1 and T3 show much higher agreement with each other than with themselves or T2, whereas T2 exhibits the opposite pattern: high intra-tool agreement but low inter-tool agreement. C. IMA++ versus other datasets Table shows that of these, ISIC 2019-Seg [15] is the only dataset with multiple annotations per image, however, its small size (100 images, 300 segmentations) makes it challenging to both conduct multi-annotator analysis as well as model the variability among the segmentations. On the other hand, while HAM10000s scale (10,015 images with single segmentation per image) is appealing, the lack of multi-expert labels limits its utility beyond traditional single segmentation modeling. Among all the single-annotator and multi-annotator publicly available SLS datasets covering both dermoscopic and clinical skin imaging modalities, IMA++ is the largest with 14,967 images and 17,684 total segmentations (Table I), allowing researchers to leverage the data for wide variety of tasks. Another desirable attribute of IMA++ is the number of new skin lesion images for which the segmentation masks are unique from past ISIC challenges. The official ISIC Segmentation Challenges dataset from 2016 through 2018 exhibit considerable overlap among each other, with 706 images being common across the three datasets [66]. To conduct thorough analysis of the overlap among all the public SLS datasets in Table I, we visualize their image identifiers in an UpSet plot 5. As expected, we find varying degrees of overlap between ISIC {2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019-Seg} datasets. Unsurprisingly, we also discover that small number of images in IMA++ also appear in the previously released ISIC datasets, albeit with Inter-annotator agreement distribution, as measured by Dice and Fig. 6. HD95, for all combinations of annotators that segmented at least 50 images. measures (DC and HD95) computed between pairs of segmentations in Figure 4 for all the factors: {annotator, tool, skill level}, and also include the consensus masks (MV and ST) in our analysis. Note that high DC and low HD95 correspond to higher levels of agreement. Since both DC and HD95 are symmetric, lower-triangular matrix-based visualization allows us to study both intra-factor (diagonal entries) and inter-factor (off-diagonal entries) agreements. Combinations of factors that are not present in the dataset have been grayed out. There are some key observations from the analysis of annotators: (i) some annotators (A01, A03) have lower levels of intra-annotator agreement, (ii) one annotator (A08) has generally low agreement with all the other annotators as well as the consensus masks, (iii) surprising pairs of low (e.g., {A00, A06}, {A03, A12}, {A04, A11}) and high (e.g., {A03, A05}, {A06, A07}) agreements emerge, which has also been observed in previous study [64], and (iv) even majority voting and STAPLE do not exhibit very high degree of agreement, emphasizing the value of multiple consensus algorithms.

However, the majority of the images in IMA++ (11,081 images out of total 14,967; 74%) are new, and their segmentation masks, singleor multi-annotator, differ from all the previous ISIC challenge datasets. IV. RECORDS AND STORAGE The list of all files available in the Zenodo repository [65] is presented in Table IV. single ZIP file contains all the segmentation masks in flat directory structure, which includes all the 17,684 masks obtained from the 16 annotators and the consensus masks (majority voting and STAPLE) for all the images with multiple segmentations, leading to total of 22,472 segmentation masks. Since the corresponding skin lesion images are already publicly available and accessible on the ISIC Archive, they are not included in this repository, and can be downloaded using the ISIC API v2 [58], [67]. The IMA++ contains rich metadata for both the images and the segmentations, whose fields are listed in Tables II and III, respectively. The images metadata contains patient (e.g., age, gender, lesion location) and clinical (e.g., type of dermoscopy, how the diagnosis was confirmed, malignancy status, hierarchical diagnosis labels, melanoma thickness, whether concomitant biopsy was taken) information. The segmentations metadata, on the other hand, contains information previously discussed: unique identifiers about the annotator, tool used, and skill level of the manual reviewer, as well as object identifiers (mskObjectID) and the MD5 hash of the segmentation file. The segmentation mask files have been richly named to contain all this information, so that even in the absence of dedicated metadata file, all the necessary information can be fetched directly from the filename. Both these metadata CSV files share column used to store the unique ISIC identifier of the skin lesion images, and this column can be used as the primary key for merging the two metadata files. V. INSIGHTS AND NOTES A. Understanding Zero Overlap Scenarios notable insight from calculating the IAA metrics (DC and HD95) was the wide variability in agreement. Focusing on the multi-annotator intersections from Figure 3 with at least 50 images segmented by two or more annotators, Figure 6 shows the distribution of Dice and HD95 for these 8 annotator sets. We observe skewed distribution of agreement levels, with high density at high agreement values and long tail extending towards low agreements, particularly evident in DC values. This is observed throughout the entire dataset as well: although most images exhibited reasonably high degree of agreement (DC: 0.866 0.187; inter-quartile range of 0.161), substantial number of images showed poor agreement. Specifically, 236 images had mean DC below 0.5, 43 below 0.1, and 23 images had segmentations with zero overlap. These 23 images and their corresponding segmentations are shown in Figure 7. Understanding what leads annotators to completely disagree on their skin lesions localizations for these 23 images might be worthwhile direction to explore. B. Inter-annotator variability, malignancy, and ABCD Multiple studies have shown, for example, that lesion segmentation variability exists in the clinic, with expert dermatologists favoring tighter segmentations [32], [34]. Recently, Abhishek et al. [56] demonstrated statistical association between IAA, measured by Dice, and the malignancy of the underlying skin lesion, showing that lower IAA values are linked to malignant lesions. This raises an important question: if clinical prediction criteria such as the ABCD rule rely on an accurate segmentation to compute the features, how does variability in segmentation impact ABCD calculations and, consequently, the diagnosis derived from these rules? Investigating the effect of segmentation variability on clinical decision-making could therefore be an interesting and important direction for future research. C. Beyond Pairwise Multi-Annotator IAA limitation of all existing measures for quantifying interannotator agreement in medical image segmentation is that they are restricted to pairwise (dis)agreement. Consequently, when reporting image-level agreement values, the (cid:0)N (cid:1) pairwise agreements computed from segmentations must be aggregated (e.g., using mean or median), which inevitably loses information about the full distribution of agreements across the segmentations. truly groupwise IAA measure is its development currently missing from the literature, yet could be highly valuable. The incomplete bipartite graph of annotators in IMA++ provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the robustness of such measure. 2 VI.
