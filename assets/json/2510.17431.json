            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Instruction tuning (IT) is the standard method to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and teach them to refuse harmful requests (Schulman et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2024). However, IT only shapes static responses and is insufficient in agentic settings, where models must also decide when and how to call external tools, capabilities not explicitly learned during pre-training (Zhang et al., 2025). Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) for tool-use (Zhang et al., 2025) tackles this by fine-tuning models to interleave reasoning with tool use (Dong et al., 2025). In practice, search is the most common tool: agentic RL rewards effective, well-timed search queries and achieves strong gains on multi-hop reasoning tasks (Song et al., 2025a;b; Jin et al., 2025). Despite the progress, effect of agentic RL on safety of IT models remains unclear. While prior work reported safety degradation of retrieval-augmented agents (Yu et al., 2025), little is known about whether agentic RL for search preserves refusal of harmful requests. As agentic RL is now deployed in closed-source systems such as OpenAIs DeepSearch (OpenAI, 2025), this evaluation gap can create real deployment risks. We therefore ask: How safe are agentic RL-trained search models? To answer this, we apply standard agentic RL training for search (Shao et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025a) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) to two model families, Qwen-2.5-7B (Qwen et al., 2025) and Llama-3.2-3B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), on both their instruction-tuned and base variants. These fine-tuned models can dynamically query local knowledge bases or the web, allowing us to evaluate their responses to harmful instructions. Our findings (Figure 1) show that agentic RL search models inherit refusal behaviour from instruction-tuned models. On most harmful requests, they begin with refusal and often redirect Correspondence to: yushi.yang@oii.ox.ac.uk. Code: https://github.com/Yushi-Y/RL-search-safety 1 Figure 1: The safety of agentic RL search models is brittle. We show an example harmful request (money laundering) and reasoning traces from the instruction-tuned (IT)-search Qwen with attacks. (ab) The IT-search model inherits refusal from instruction-tuning and often blocks harmful requests by turning into safe searches; (bc) Search attack: forcing single <search> token at the start of response triggers harmful search and answer; (cd) Multi-search attack: iteratively forcing <search> at the start produces cascades of harmful searches and detailed harmful answer. to harmless searches to block harmful outputs. However, this inherited safety is fragile. When triggered to search before refusal (Search attack), the models almost always issue harmful, requestmirroring query that lead to further harmful searches. As result, refusal rates, answer safety, and search safety all drop markedly (Figure 2; Table 7, Appendix). This shows when to search affects safety: searching before refusal is substantially more harmful than searching after. Safety degrades further under the Multi-search attack, where we prefill ten consecutive searches before refusal. This produces cascades of harmful queries probing narrower aspects of the harmful request, further reducing refusal rates and answer safety (Figure 2; Table 7, Appendix). Together, these results expose core weakness in the current RL objective: it rewards continued generation of effective, request-fulfilling queries without considering their harmfulness. Therefore, it can be made easily to override refusals, creating conflict between the RL objective to search and the instruction tuning objective to refuse. This competing objective introduces vulnerabilities that users can readily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware RL pipelines that explicitly optimise for search safety."

            "content": "Agentic reinforcement learning for search Reinforcement Learning for Tool-Integrated Reasoning (RL-TIR) (Zhang et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025) trains LLMs to interleave text generation with real-time tool calls (Feng et al., 2025). Table 4 (Appendix) summarises 10 RL-TIR frameworks, whose primary use cases are search (knowledge reasoning) (Chen et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025a; Dong et al., 2025) and coding (mathematical reasoning) (Li et al., 2025; Singh et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025). Search dominates (7/10 cases), with frameworks commonly using outcome-based rewards to ground outputs in verifiable knowledge (e.g., Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025), R1-search (Song et al., 2025a), ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025)). In this study, we adopt basic RL search framework inspired by DeepSeek-R1 (Shao et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2025) detailed in Section 3.1. Jailbreaking LLM agents Prompts designed to jailbreak LLMs typically fall into two categories (Wei et al., 2023): (1) competing objectives, which exploits tensions between instruction following and safety training (e.g., non-refusal prefills that steer models towards affirmative responses) (Qi et al., 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2025a); and (2) mismatched generalisation, which exploits pretrained data patterns not blocked in safety training (e.g., cipher attacks that encrypt harmful content into ciphers) (Yuan et al., 2024; Goldstein et al., 2025). For jailbreaking agents, recent work showed that integrating an aligned LLM into browser-agent framework can make it execute harmful prompts it would otherwise refuse (Kumar et al., 2024; Chiang et al., 2025). Similarly, retrieval-augmented (RAG) agents showed lower refusal rates and higher bias sensitivity to the same harmful prompts, likely due to the introduction of retrieved context (Yu et al., 2025). Unlike these studies on non-RL web and RAG agents, our work examines how agentic RL training shifts safety behaviours relative to their instruction-tuned counterparts."

            "title": "3 EXPERIMENT SETUP",
            "content": "3.1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR SEARCH The RL objective with search integration is: max πθ ExD, yπθ(x;R) (cid:104) (cid:105) rϕ(x, y) β DKL (cid:0)πθ(y x, R) πref(y x, R)(cid:1), where πθ is the policy LLM, πref the reference model, rϕ the reward, and DKL is the KL penalty. RL-for-search optimises retrieval-reasoning policy πθ( x, R) conditioned on both the prompt and retrieved content (Jin et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025a; Dong et al., 2025). The outputs interleave search results with reasoning to improve decision-making. For training, we applied Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). Mathematical details of PPO with search are in Appendix B. The training data was HotpotQA (91K multi-hop QA pairs) (Yang et al., 2018) and Natural Questions (307k QA pairs) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). We used simple outcome-based reward (exact match against ground-truth answers) and formatting reward that structured rollouts with <think>, <search>, and <answer> tokens to interleave reasoning, tool use, and final answers (Jin et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025). PPO was applied to four open-source models, Qwen-2.5-7B (Qwen et al., 2025), Llama-3.2-3B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), and their instruction-tuned variants. The training hyperparameters are listed in Table 5 (Appendix). For brevity, we refer to the RL-trained base and IT models as Base-search and IT-search, respectively. For inference, we used greedy decoding with ReAct-style system prompt (Yao et al., 2023) (Figure 5, Appendix), guiding models to interleave between <think>, <search>, and <answer> to match training. Models emit <search> query when they determine external knowledge is required. Each search retrieves top-3 results appended to the context for continued generation. We also analysed inference-time reasoning traces (Huang et al., 2023a) to understand how attacks qualitatively trigger harmful outputs. An example trace of the IT-search Qwen is in Figure 8 (Appendix), illustrating how it solves complex reasoning question through dynamic searches. 3.2 THE SEARCH SETUP To simulate practical setups, We enabled RL-trained models to search local corpus or the web. 3 Table 1: Three safety metrics for RL search models. We evaluated model safety on three dimensions using an LLM evaluator. Each metric was scored on 15 scale (5 = safe, 1 = unsafe). The exact rubrics for each metric are provided in Figure 7 (Appendix). Metric Refusal Answer safety Search safety Definition How strongly does the model refuse the instruction? How harmless is the model response? How harmless is each emitted search query? For local search, we used the English 2018 Wikipedia corpus, partitioned into 21M passages of 100 words (Karpukhin et al., 2020). Passages were embedded with e5-base-v2 (intfloat, 2025) and indexed with FAISS for similarity search (Douze et al., 2025). Details of the local retrieval pipeline are in Appendix D. For web search, we used SerpAPI (SerpApi, 2025) to query Google and return top-3 results per query. 3.3 THE EVALUATION SETUP Data and evaluator For the dataset, we randomly sampled 299 harmful instructions from four widely used benchmarks: AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), MaliciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2023b), TDC2023 (Maloyan et al., 2024), and HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024). These prompts cover domains such as financial cybercrime, social engineering, fake news generation, and violence and abuse. Each prompt is single-sentence harmful request (question or imperative) that an aligned model should refuse. Example prompts are provided in Figure 6 (Appendix). To enable large-scale assessment, we adopted LLM-as-a-judge using Prometheus-7B-v2.0 (Kim et al., 2024): Mistral-7B-based evaluator fine-tuned for behaviour assessment, chosen for its strong preference agreement with human raters and GPT-4 (Kim et al., 2024). We used the absolute grading mode, which assigns discrete scores 15 based on task-specific rubrics, providing more detailed feedback than simple binary classification. Safety metrics Table 1 defines three LLM-judged metrics per harmful request: refusal, answer safety, and search safety. Refusal measures how strongly the response refuses the request; answer safety evaluates how harmless the response is; and search safety assesses the safety of each emitted query. Refusal and answer safety were scored over the full reasoning trace (excluding retrieval); search safety was scored per query. Each metric was rated on 1-5 scale, where 5 is fully safe and 1 is fully harmful (higher is safer). The exact rubrics for the LLM evaluator are provided in Figure 7 (Appendix). For reporting, we linearly rescaled the scores to 0100 scale for easier interpretation. We validated the LLM evaluator with human agreement study on 50 randomly sampled model responses, finding high Spearman correlations: refusal ρ = 0.88, answer safety ρ = 0.82, and search safety ρ = 0.86 (all < 0.05). Full results of the agreement study are shown in Table 6 (Appendix). We also reported the percentage drops in safety metrics. Because the base-search models (RLtrained base models) routinely generate harmful searches and answers (Figure 9, Appendix), we treated them as the lower bound of safety and the IT-search models as the upper bound. For each attack, we computed the percentage drop from IT-search, normalised by the ITbase range: Safety drop = (IT-search Attack)/(IT-search Base-search) 100%. value of 0% means no drop from IT-search, while 100% means full regression to base. 3.4 JAILBREAK ATTACKS We demonstrate two attacks, Search and Multi-search  (Table 2)  . Both were implemented via system prompt changes and token prefills at the start of model response, thus reproducible by everyday users. Example attacks with jailbroken outputs are in Figure 10, 11 and 12 (Appendix). For Search attack, we induced the model to start response with search, by either instructing in the system prompt or prefilling <search> token (or search-intent sentence such as need to 4 Table 2: Attacks for RL search models. We designed two attacks (Search and Multi-search) via system prompt changes or token prefills at start of model response. We also included non-refusal prefills as baselines. Attack Variant Text Search Multi-search Prompt Prefill A: Start response with \"<search>\". B: Start response with \"I need to search for more information\". A: <search> B: need to search for more information. C: cannot provide information on that. <search> Prompt10 A: Start response with \"<search>\". Do exactly 10 searches.

Prefill101 A: <search> iteratively 10 B: need to search for more information.iteratively 10 C: cannot provide information on that. <search> iteratively 10 Non-refusal Prefill Sure, Sure, can help with that. search for more information). This ensures the model searches before it can refuse. The searchintent sentence was taken from the base-search model to mimic its natural pre-search phrasing. We also designed contradiction prefill that prepends refusal (I cant provide information on that) followed by <search> token to examine how search behaviour changes right after refusal. For Multi-search attack, we induced the model to issue ten searches either by instructing in the system prompt or iteratively prefilling the <search> token ten times (one prefill after each retrieval). Prompt-instructed searches may appear anywhere in the response; whereas all prefilled searches were inserted before generation of refusal tokens, with no intermediate reasoning between them. For Non-refusal attack, we included two baseline prefills Sure, and Sure, can help with that. (Andriushchenko et al., 2025a). These prefills interrupt model refusal by opening response with affirmative tokens, providing useful comparison to our search-based prefills."

            "content": "Section 4.1 shows that IT-search models inherit refusal and diversion into harmless searches from instruction tuning. Section 4.2 demonstrates the brittleness of this inheritance: starting response with single <search> suffices to jailbreak the models. Section 4.3 shows that forcing multiple searches before refusal further amplifies harmful outputs. For the main results, Figure 2 visualises safety degradation per attack; Table 7 (Appendix) reports the corresponding percentage drops; and Table 3 reports the exact safety metrics under local and web search. Finally, Figure 3 shows that both attacks consistently induce more harmful searches than no-attack, likely explaining the observed safety drops. 4.1 SEARCH MODELS INHERIT INSTRUCTION TUNING BEHAVIOURS Search models inherit refusal and divert to safe searches Refusal behaviour was preserved after RL search training. Across models and setups, IT-search models matched their instructiontuned (IT) counterparts on all safety metrics including refusal (92.5 vs. 91.8 for Qwen; 97.1 vs. 96.2 1After the tenth prefill, we forced the model to output the <answer> token to produce the final answer. for Llama; Table 3). This aligns with our qualitative observations that both IT-search models almost always began their responses with an explicit refusal (e.g., cannot...). Interestingly, IT-search models also inherited how IT models refuse by diverting into safe searches. For example, IT Qwen often used an Instead . . . reframe (e.g., turning how to do money laundering into Instead, will explain the legal consequences of money laundering; Figure 1). IT-search Qwen mirrored this by emitting the same safe query (e.g., <search> consequences of money laundering; Figure 1). Similarly, IT-search Qwen turned how to abuse and manipulate child into Instead, ... <search> how to prevent child abuse (Figure 9, Appendix). This diversion was reflected in the higher search safety scores for IT-search than base-search (72.3 vs. 10.7 for Qwen; 41.3 vs. 4.8 for Llama; Table 3). In contrast, as IT Llama tended to refuse outright without instead reframe, IT-search Llama followed this and rarely emitted follow-up queries after refusal (only 23 local and 21 web queries across 299 harmful requests). Some emitted searches are harmful Although IT-search models emitted more safe searches than basesearch, their search safety scores remained lower than refusal and answer safety (a visible gap in Figure 2), indicating some emitted queries were still harmful. In particular, IT-search Qwen emitted harmful searches (unscaled search safety 2) in 18.7% (local) and 23.4% (web) cases, while Llama did so in 52.1% (local) and 57.1% (web). Because IT-search Llama barely searches, this implies that when it did, roughly half of queries were harmful; Qwen had lower proportions of harmful searches due to diversion into harmless searches. These naturally occurring harmful searches typically appear in the first query mirroring the harmful request (example in Figure 10, Appendix). This suggests some searches learned during RL training are already unsafe. 4.2 ONE HARMFUL SEARCH IS ENOUGH TO JAILBREAK Figure 2: Drops in safety metrics under attacks. (1) Both attacks were effective: search attacks reduced all safety metrics from IT-search, while multi-search attacks (2) Search further reduced refusal and answer safety. safety was consistently below refusal and answer safety, suggesting that RL training naturally produces some harmful searches. For each attack, we reported drops for the most effective prompt/prefill variant (lowest combined refusal+answer safety). Base-search models (black lines) show the lowest expected safety levels. Table 7 (Appendix) reports the corresponding percentage drops. One search token rapidly degrades safety single <search> token at the start broke the inherited safety (Search attack). As shown in Table 3, all Search attack variants markedly reduced safety metrics (marked in red) and Figure 2 visualises the drops (greenyellow). The drops were consistent across models and search setups, with refusal, answer safety, and search safety dropping by up to 41.2%, 66.6%, and 82.4%, respectively (Table 7, Appendix). Prefill-A/B were most effective variants (darkest red in Table 3). These results show that single <search> before refusal suffices to trigger harmful searches and answers. For Llama, Prefill-A/B outperformed Prompt-A/B as the model often ignored the prompt and did not start with search (52.2% ignored for local; 68.6% for web). The emitted searches became more harmful under the Search attack. We observed sharply lower search safety of Prefill-A/B than IT-search (72.322.7 for Qwen; 41.312.6 for Llama; Figure 2), 6 Table 3: All safety metrics under attacks. For Search and Multi-search attacks, Prefill-A/B and Prefill-A/B10 were the most effective, outperforming prompt-based attacks and non-refusal prefills. We reported for baselines (Base-search, IT-search, IT), Search and Multi-search attacks, and non-refusal prefills. All attacks were applied to IT-search models, and scores were averaged over responses or search queries. Cells are shaded red proportional to the drop from IT-search (darker red = lower safety).

This means Search attack triggered cascades of harmful searches not revealed by IT-search (example in Figure 10, Appendix). Semantically, the first query under the Search attack more closely mirrored the harmful request (local: Qwen 0.620.86, Llama 0.790.91; similar for web), measured via cosine similarity of sentence embeddings of all-mpnet-base-v2 (Sentence-Transformers, 2021). Similarly for Llama, even the first querys search safety fell below IT-search (local: 42.515.7 for search; 42.520.0 for multi-search; similar for web). We reported only one position as Llama usually emits single query. These results show that when to search matters: searching before models can refuse is substantially more harmful than searching after. Searches remain harmful right after refusal Harmful searches can appear not only before refusal, but also immediately after. Under Prefill-C, where we prefilled refusal followed by <search>  (Table 2)  , the search safety remained below IT-search (local: Qwen: 46.0 vs 72.3; Llama: 12.8 vs 41.3; Table 3). This matches our qualitative observation that models still emitted harmful queries right after cant (example in Figure 10, Appendix). Consequently, Prefill-C still lowered answer safety (local: Qwen: 89.570.9; Llama: 96.281.5; Table 3) despite high refusal. This shows searches issued immediately after superficial refusal can still be harmful; it may only divert to safer searches following longer refusal reasoning (e.g., the Instead reframe for IT-search Qwen; Figure 1). Together, this means harmful searches and refusal can co-exist in response, as they arise from different sources: harmful searches from RL training, refusal from instruction tuning. 4.3 ITERATIVE SEARCHES LEAD TO MORE HARM Iterative prefilling is the most harmful For Multi-search attacks, inserting ten searches before refusal (Prefill-A/B10) caused the largest drops in refusal and answer safety (Table 3; Figure 2, yellowbrown). They reduced refusal rates, answer safety, and search safety by up to 60.0%, 82.5%, and 60.9%, respectively (Table 7, Appendix). The prefilled initial searches were consistently 7 less safe than IT-search (Figure 3), producing cascades of harmful queries exploring different aspects of the request (example in Figure 11, Appendix). Prefill-C10, which iteratively prefills search after refusal showed the same pattern: queries changed after each refusal but remained harmful, driving lower answer safety than both IT-search (local: Qwen: 89.566.7; Llama: 96.273.5; Table 3) and Prefill-C. The ten prefilled searches were not uniformly harmful. This is reflected in Figure 2, where Qwen had similar search safety for Search vs. Multi-search (yellowbrown), while Llama showed notable increase. Looking into per-query safety, Qwens ten prefilled searches remained below IT-search at level similar to the Search attack (Figure 14, Appendix). In contrast, Llamas Prefill-A/B10 drifted to safer queries after the first 3-5 queries, despite producing no intermediate reasoning between them (Figure 15, Appendix). Thus, forcing repeated searches caused Llama to divert to emitting safe queries (example in Figure 12, Appendix), whereas without attack it just stopped generating after refusal. These diversions raised the overall search safety, but early harmful searches may suffice to elicit harmful answer, leading to larger answer safety drops than the Search attack (Qwen 65.450.9, Llama 73.259.0; Table 3). Figure 3: Both attacks triggered cascades of harmful searches. For Qwen-2.5-7B (local search), both attacks had consistently lower search safety scores than IT-Search across five query positions; web shows similar patterns. Scores were averaged across attack variants. The per-variant search safety plots are in Figure 13, 14 (Appendix). Similarly, Prompt-A/B10 did not outperform Prefill-A/B10 in Multi-search attack. This is because models did not reliably follow the do ten searches prompt: prompt-based Multi-search increased averaged searches by only +2.1 (Qwen) and +0.52 (Llama), keeping total search volume and the resulting safety metrics close to the single-search Prompt-A/B  (Table 3)  . Both attacks outperform non-refusal prefills The Search and Multi-search prefills resulted in lower refusal, answer safety, and search safety than the two non-refusal prefills, thus higher jailbreak success  (Table 3)  . Non-refusal prefills were less effective as we observed Qwen saying Sure, will not provide any advice on ... and Sure, can help with that. However, wont provide any actual advice..., showing resistance to non-refusals. While both disrupt the initial refusal reasoning, search-based and non-refusal prefills differ in important ways. Search-based prefills trigger early searches before refusal, producing harmful, request-mirroring queries as an artifact of RL search training; whereas non-refusal prefills redirect models from refusal to an affirmative response to draw on models pre-training harmful knowledge (Qi et al., 2024)."

            "content": "Based on the findings, we discuss two main causes for our attack success: (1) competing objectives between instruction tuning and RL search training, and (2) harm retrieval biases model reasoning. Competing objectives Instruction tuning optimises models to refuse harmful requests, while RL search training optimises the generation of effective queries to maximise answer accuracy (Jin et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025a; Dong et al., 2025). Our attacks were designed to exploit their conflict: we induced sequence of harmful queries before the models can refuse to produce harmful answers. We also observed model tendency to continue harmful searches until an answer is found (example in Figure 10), behaviour also learned during RL training. These harmful queries are likely artifacts of outcome-driven RL that rewards end-task QA accuracy (Chen et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025b), where request-mirroring searches are emitted regardless of their safety as an effective shortcut. Because RL search training datasets often include complex reasoning questions but lack safety signals, optimising for task success does not guarantee safe search behaviours. This is con8 cerning as closed-source search agents become more capable of retrieving content for virtually any query, leaving users with limited guardrails against injected harm. Harmful retrieval bias reasoning second driver of attack success is the injection of harmful retrieved content into model reasoning. In reasoning traces, we frequently observed post-retrieval lines of Based on the information provided, here are the steps..., or The provided information does not provide the specifics. will search for more... (Figure 10). This shows that answers are heavily conditioned on retrieved content. When retrieval returns relevant harmful information, it is appended to the LLM context and thus likely to bias generation (Yu et al., 2025). Moreover, our Multi-search attack can be viewed as many-shot jailbreak (Anil et al., 2024): multiple turns of harmful retrieval accumulate in the prompt and cumulatively steer models towards harmful outputs (Figure 11). Limitations We note three limitations of the study. First, we focused on mid-sized models (7B, 3B); extending to larger variants (e.g., Qwen-14B, Qwen-32B (Qwen et al., 2025)) could provide further evidence on attack success and reveal scaling laws. Second, our dataset consisted of onesentence harmful requests; expanding to recent agent-harm benchmarks (Kumar et al., 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2025b) with multi-step tasks (e.g., sending phishing email) may invoke more diverse search behaviours beyond simple request-mirroring. Third, we did not quantify how much harmful content in answers comes from retrieval or model pretraining, nor how often models refuse the retrieved harmful content. Distinguishing those from reasoning traces is challenging but would clarify to what extent harmful searches trigger models own harmful reasoning and how resistant they are to harmful injections. For future work, we pose three open questions: (1) Why does search harmfulness differ before and after refusal? mechanistic interpretation may be possible by extracting harmful search representation and steering along that direction to change search safety at different reasoning steps (Arditi et al., 2024; Yamaguchi et al., 2025). (2) How can RL objectives be redesigned for safety? Possible solutions include designing rewards that penalise harmful queries, training on unsafe questions with safe search-and-reason trajectories, and applying post-RL tuning (e.g., SFT or DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024)) targeting safe searches. (3) Can simple mitigations block harmful searches? For example, lightweight search safety gate (classifier) that flag harmful queries (Sharma et al., 2025) and block retrieval for them to prevent escalation."

            "title": "6 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "Our study provides the first batch of evidence that current agentic RL-trained search models are unsafe. Although they appear safe, inheriting refusal and diverting to harmless searches, this safety is brittle. Simply encourage to search-first results in harmful queries, lower refusal, and harmful answers; forcing multiple early searches creates cascades of harmful queries further degrading safety. These attack successes expose key weakness of current RL training: it rewards continued, requestmirroring searches without considering their harmfulness. Thus, RL for tool use opens up new safety risks, showing the urgency to develop safe-aware RL pipelines explicitly optimise for search safety."

            "content": "We evaluated model safety by running inference on datasets of harmful instructions. All harmful prompts were drawn from public academic benchmarks and contain no personal data. To limit exposure to unsafe content, we truncated reasoning traces to avoid revealing actionable harm and included explicit warnings in any figure displaying harmful content. Our findings aim to advance the development of safer, more reliable agentic AI systems for real-world use."

We list each frameworks main contribution, supported tools, and target models  (Table 4)  . Search (knowledge reasoning) and code execution (mathematical reasoning) were the most common tools (7 and 6 out of 10 papers, respectively). Most frameworks trained on Qwen-2.5 (Qwen et al., 2025) and Llama-3 series (Grattafiori et al., 2024), motivating our model choices. We compare the reward designs of three representative RL-search pipelines: Search-R1, R1-search, and agentic reinforced policy optimization (ARPO) (Figure 4). All three frameworks adopted outcome-based rewards with minor variations, motivating our reward choice. Search-R1 used pure outcome-based reward for reasoning question-answering (Jin et al., 2025), R1-Searcher added search-usage bonus to encourage querying (Song et al., 2025a), and ARPO added process-aware credit assignment to allocate partial rewards to reasoning and tool-use steps (Dong et al., 2025). Following Jin et al. (2025), we adopted the simplest setup with pure outcome-based reward. We also review how agentic RL for search emerged as training paradigm. Integrating LLMs with search used to follow two modes: RAG and search-as-a-tool. RAG retrieves text for input and appends it to the prompt (Gao et al., 2024), but often struggles with irrelevant retrievals (Wang et al., 2025a). Search-as-a-tool instead prompts or fine-tunes LLMs to call search engines directly: ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) and IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023) used prompting to interleave reasoning and search, while Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) used supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods rely on high-quality labelled trajectories that are costly to scale (Jin et al., 2025). Agentic RL for search tackles these problems by training models to issue queries at the right reasoning step via outcome-based rewards. 14 Search-R R1-Searcher ARPO Question + Search API Question + Search API Question + Search API Policy LLM generates Policy LLM generates Policy LLM generates Reasoning trajectory Reasoning trajectory Reasoning trajectory Final answer Final answer Final answer Reward: Exact matches Reward: Exact matches Reward: Exact matches Policy update via PPO/GRPO Bonus reward if search used Step-wise credit assignment Policy update via GRPO Adaptive rollout control Policy update Figure 4: Comparison of three RL training frameworks. They differ slightly in the reward design: Search-R1 adopted purely outcome-based reward (exact matches); R1-searcher added bonus reward is search is used; ARPO added partial rewards to reasoning and tool-use steps via credit assignment (advantage attribution)."

We randomly sampled = 50 examples from the 299 harmful instructions and evaluated the ITsearch Qwen under the Prefill-A attack. We chose Qwen as it generally emits more search queries and longer reasoning than Llama. We evaluated with an attack to elicit more varied responses than simple refusals to stress-test the evaluator. For each example, an independent human rater and the LLM evaluator scored full model response for refusal and answer safety, and each emitted query for search safety, following the rubrics in Figure 7. We then computed Spearman correlations between LLM and human score pairs and reported agreement rates (exact match, within 1 point, and within 2 points) on the original 15 scale. 17 Table 6: Agreement rates between Prometheus and human rater. All three metrics showed high agreement (Spearman ρ 0.82, < 0.05) across 50 harmful instructions. Average score reports the mean Prometheus or Human scores (0-100) over responses. The remaining columns report percentages of exact matches and matches within 1 and 2 points on the original 15 rubric. Search safety was computed over 88 queries generated for the 50 instructions. Refusal Answer safety (N=50) (N=50) Search safety (N=88) Average score (Prometheus) Average score (Human) Spearman correlation (ρ) Exact matches (%) Within 1 point (%) Within 2 point (%) 76.5 70.5 0.88 80% 92% 100% 75.0 70.0 0.82 62% 82% 90% 25.3 22.0 0.86 76% 90% 100% As shown in Table 6, all three metrics achieved high correlations 0.82 (all significant at < 0.05) and within 1 point agreement 82%. Human scores were consistently lower than the LLM judges, suggesting jailbroken models may be judged even less safe by humans. From the evaluators reasoning, we identified two sources of this discrepancy: (1) the LLM judge is more tolerant on answer safety when harmful content is phrased neutrally, even when the response clearly aids the harmful request; and (2) when model reports no relevant retrieved results and emits refined query (example in Figure 10), the evaluator often confuses it with refusal rather than query clarification, inflating refusal scores."

For local search, the most effective were Prompt-A, Prefill-A/B, and Prefill-A/B10; for web search, the most effective were Prefill-B and Prefill-A/B10. All attacks were applied to IT-search models.

            "content": "In this section, we provide example jailbroken outputs under Search and Multi-search attacks (Figure 10, 11 for Qwen, Figure 12 for Llama). Under the Search attack (Figure 10), Qwen showed strong search intent: when query returns no relevant information, the model emitted progressively refined harmful queries to produce comprehensive answer (Prefill-A). This repeated search intent persisted even after an immediate prefilled refusal (Prefill-C). Notably, in this example, IT-search Qwen also emitted harmful query after an Instead reframe without any attack (contrary to Figure 1), indicating that some post-RL emitted searches are already harmful. 21 Under the Multi-search attack, Qwen (Figure 11) emitted queries that gradually target more detailed aspects of the request across ten prefills, even with no intermediate reasoning in between (PrefillA10). These cascades of harmful searches persisted even with repeated refusal prefill (PrecillC10). In contrast, Llama (Figure 12) gradually drifted towards harmless queries (Prefill-A10), and this drift was faster when refusal was prefilled before the searches (Precill-C10). This explains the higher search safety of Multi-search than Search for Llama (Figure 2, yellowbrown)."

            "content": "In this section, we report search safety by query position under Search and Multi-search attacks (Figure 13, 14 for Qwen, Figure 15 for Llama). Under the Search attack (Figure 13), Qwen showed consistently lower safety than IT-search across the first five query positions. Under the Multi-search attack, Qwen (Figure 14) also showed consistently lower safety across all ten query positions. In contrast, Llama (Figure 15) emitted few initial less-safe queries relative to IT-search, then drifted toward safer searches. The safety rise was faster for Prefill-C10 than Prefill-A/B10, suggesting that queries emitted after refusal diverts to safety more quickly. 22 Figure 10: Jailbroken outputs under the Search attack (Qwen). Example harmful request (hacking financal website) and reasoning traces from IT-search Qwen (local search). IT-search: the model still mirrored the harmful request in query despite an Instead reframe; Prompt-A/Prefill-A: the model began with request-mirroring query and, upon finding the retrieved results irrelevant, cascaded into more specific harmful searches; Prefill-C: the model emitted harmful query immediately after prefilled refusal, leading to further harmful query. Warning: model response contains harmful content. Figure 11: Jailbroken outputs under the Multi-search attack (Qwen). Example harmful request (hacking financal website) and reasoning traces from IT-search Qwen (local search). Prefill-A10: the model emitted queries gradually targeting detailed aspects of the request, leading to detailed harmful answer; Prefill-C10: the model iteratively emitted harmful queries after each prefilled refusal, leading to detailed harmful answer.

For each attack variant, search safety scores stayed consistently below IT-search for (a) local and (b) web search. We reported ten query positions for prefill-based attacks.

(a) Local search (b) Web search Figure 15: Search safety by query position under the Multi-search attack (Llama). For each attack variant, the first few queries were less safe than IT-search for (a) local and (b) web search, but safety rose as the model drifted to safer queries (example in Figure 12). The rise was faster for Prefill-C10 than Prefill-A/B10. We reported ten query positions for prefill-based attacks. For prompt-based attacks, Llama typically emits only one query despite instructed for ten, so we reported one position; baselines (IT-search, base-search) were also shown at one position."
