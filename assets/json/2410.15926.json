            "content": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) [46, 45, 84, 71, 6, 15, 5] have drawn increasing attention from the AI research community due to their impressive power in understanding the visual world and unprecedented ability to interact with humans via conversations. Their capability to process multimodal sequences has opened up new possibilities for wide range of vision and language tasks [32, 2], such as handling interleaved image-text inputs [4, 35] and interactive user queries [82]. However, existing LVLMs still suffer from object hallucination [57, 41, 44, 14], tendency to generate inaccurate responses that are not factually aligned with image inputs. Such phenomenon challenges the faithfulness and reliability of LVLMs in practical use, impeding their deployments to real-world applications [14]. wide range of approaches have been proposed to mitigate object hallucination in LVLMs. One straightforward approach involves post-hoc correction using revisor models [73, 83], reducing occurrences of hallucinated responses. Another viable approach is to improve supervised fine-tuning by diversifying instruction tuning data [43] or additionally aligning model responses with human preference [62, 76]. Despite their effectiveness in mitigating LVLM object hallucination, acquiring high-quality annotations can be labor-intensive, making these approaches costly to implement. Recently, several studies explore training-free mitigation of object hallucination by rectifying fallacies in LVLM autoregressive decoding [26, 34]. However, the need to compare among many candidates inevitably slows down the decoding process, making these approaches less efficient during inference. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).

For each of visual tokens Svision, we aggregate its information flow to instruction tokens Sinstruct and reshape the aggregation ). Applying RoPE on visual tokens introduces long-term decay as results to 2-D ( illustrated in (c), referring to the phenomenon where information flowing from visual tokens to instruction tokens gradually decays from lower-right region (rightmost visual tokens in the 1-D sequence) to upper-left region (leftmost visual tokens). For instruction tokens, they have much less direct interaction with leftmost visual tokens as compared with rightmost visual tokens, leading to inferior multimodal alignment in the trained LVLMs. (b) and (c) are derived from the adversarial subset of the 3k POPE [41] image-instruction pairs.

            "content": "Distinct from previous efforts, we attend to Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) [61], widely used positional dependency modeling design in LVLMs [46, 84], and investigate how it may affect object hallucination in LVLMs. Similar to sinusoidal function [65], RoPE is proposed to encode position information into representations, enhancing models ability in understanding sequential order of input tokens. In spite of its success in modeling natural language [53, 63, 64], this design leads to long-term decay [61] in multimodal alignment, phenomenon where information flow from visual tokens to instruction tokens1 gradually diminishes with increasing relative distance. We analyze the impact of long-term decay [61, 53] on LVLMs. For every visual token in multimodal sequence, we aggregate its information flow to all instruction tokens and examine how these aggregations distribute across all visual tokens. As presented, in contrast to information flows of visual tokens without RoPE (Fig. 1, (b)), applying RoPE attenuates information flows of leftmost visual tokens, which are located the farthest from instruction tokens in the sequence (Fig. 1, (c)). Such long-term decay benefits natural language modeling [61], but induces insufficient interactions between visual tokens and instruction tokens, leading to inferior multimodal alignment and object hallucinations in the trained LVLMs (see our experiments in Sec. 3 for details). To this end, we propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), novel position alignment method for training LVLMs with mitigated object hallucination. CCA consists of position reorganization module for visual tokens and an accompanying causal mask rectification module for modeling 2-D continuous positional dependency. Instead of following raster-scan 2 sequential order of existing LVLMs, CCA starts from peripheral of 2-D images and ends in centers. Such position alignment strategy enjoys two merits: 1) relative distance from instruction tokens to visual tokens are significantly reduced, alleviating limitations brought by long-term decay in RoPE; 2) rectified causal attentions follow 2-D spatial locality of images, as compared to 1-D causal attention originally designed for natural languages. We carry out pre-training and instruction tuning as [46] and verify our trained model on multiple object hallucination benchmarks [41, 57, 20] (+4.24% on Accuracy and +2.73% on F1 score, as compared to the state-of-the-art method [34] on POPE). From broader perspective, our method also improves general perception capability of LVLMs. Preliminary experiments show that our positional alignment approach surpasses the baseline consistently over 6 multimodal benchmarks [36, 48, 22, 28, 49, 8]. 1Information flow here refers to self-attentions from instruction tokens to visual tokens. 22-D image tokens are flattened from left to right, top to bottom, into 1-D visual token sequence. 2 Our contributions are three-fold. First, we perform in-depth analysis on correlation between rotary position encoding and object hallucination in large vision-language models. Second, motivated by our analysis, we propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), simple yet effective method to mitigate LVLM object hallucination caused by RoPE long-term decay. Third, experiments on multiple benchmarks and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods support efficacy of our design."

            "content": "Large Vision Language Models. Language modeling has made notable progress in recent years, evolving from robust representation models [17, 56, 55] to instruction-tuned conversational chatbots [63, 64, 12, 1]. These achievements have driven research in creating Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) that can manage multimodal inputs [72, 46, 45, 84, 71, 6, 67, 40, 51, 39]. Pioneering studies in this field [2, 4, 38, 37] connect vision-only encoder with powerful frozen language-only model to bridge modality gap, enabling dense interactions across visual and textual features. Powered by instruction-tuned LLMs [12], LLaVA [46], InstructBLIP [15] and MiniGPT4 [84] allow interactive conversations between trained models and users. On top of these studies, LVLMs are empowered with more advanced capabilities, such as engaging in referential dialogues [7, 74, 81, 54, 77], handling interleaved image-text data [2, 4, 35] or understanding visual prompts, like point or box inputs from users [54, 82, 9, 77]. Despite advancements in LVLMs, many of these models still generate inaccurate responses not aligned with visual inputs. Object Hallucination refers to common problem of existing LVLMs [14, 44, 21, 41, 68, 52, 3, 19, 66]. Specifically, LVLMs tend to generate inaccurate responses that are not factually aligned with image inputs. To address this issue, several recent explorations [73, 83, 33] resort to post-hoc correction of model hallucinated outputs. These methods rely on either external models [47] to correct hallucinated responses [73] or on self-correction techniques [33, 70]. However, both of these methods break end-to-end inference scheme. In contrast, [43, 76, 62, 29, 78, 75] ground their approaches on improving instruction tuning, by either diversifying instruction data or aligning model responses with human feedback. However, acquisition of more instruction data or preference data is labor-intensive. Recently, several studies attempt to mitigate object hallucination in training-free manner [26, 34, 10]. However, the need to compare among many candidates inevitably slows down the decoding process, making these approaches less efficient during inference. From distinct perspective, we ground our design in correlation between widely adopted rotary position encoding and object hallucination. Position Encoding in Transformers. Transformer models [65] do not inherently comprehend sequential information of input tokens, which is inferior for modeling sequential data like natural language as compared to recurrent structures like [24]. To mitigate this issue, [65] introduces sinusoidal position encodings to incorporate position information to input embeddings. In addition, several studies resort to learnable position encodings [18], which allow their models to update positional parameters during training. In contrast to absolute position encodings, relative position encodings [59, 31, 23, 27] focus on relative position among tokens. They integrate position information in self-attentions, presenting potential for modeling sequences with variable lengths [61, 53]. Among these studies, Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) [61] encodes position information by multiplying input embeddings with rotation matrices. In comparison to other position encoding designs, RoPE is capable of equipping linear self-attention with relative position encoding, which is proven effective for pre-training large language models [63, 64]. few recent studies explores RoPE for vision tasks [13, 50, 69], showcasing its potential to domains beyond natural language. In this paper, we investigate the role of RoPE in LVLMs and how it affects object hallucination in these models."

We begin with brief introduction to the widely adopted LVLM architecture and how RoPE [61] is applied in LVLMs. Then, we highlight the long-term decay in RoPE [61, 53], which benefits language modeling but is under-explored for multimodal alignment. Finally, we examine the role of RoPE in LVLM object hallucination through comparative experiments, which forms strong foundation of our design. 3 LVLM. Typically, an LVLM is composed of pretrained vision encoder Fv, large language model Ft and projector module that maps visual embeddings to textual space. Given an image input Iv and instruction input It (e.g., please describe this image in detail), encodes these two inputs into multimodal sequence = {Svision, Sinstruct}, where Svision = (Fv(Iv)) = {wm}V m=1 and Sinstruct = Ft(It) = {wm}T m=1 represent visual and instruction tokens of lengths and , respectively. In such sequence, visual and instruction tokens share the same dimension d, noted as wm Rd. Rotary Position Encoding in LVLM. In LLMs like LLaMA [63] and its multimodal successors, RoPE [61] encodes position information with input tokens by multiplying every token wm with rotation matrix Rd θ,m, Rd θ,m = cos mθ1 sin mθ1 cos mθ1 sin mθ1 0 0 0 0 ... ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 cos mθ2 sin mθ2 cos mθ2 sin mθ2 ... ... 0 0 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 ... cos mθd/2 sin mθd/2 cos mθd/2 sin mθd/2 (1) where [1, ..., + ] indicates position of input token wm and {θi = 100002(i1)/d}, [1, 2, ..., d/2]) are pre-defined sinusoidal function values following [65]. In LVLMs like LLaVA [46], rotary matrices Rd θ,m are applied to query and key tokens in all decoder layers, such that relative position dependency among tokens are modeled and integrated in self-attentions across the network. In comparison to absolute position encodings [65] and learnable position encodings in ViT [18], RoPE captures relative distance among input tokens and has the potential to extend the input context window beyond fixed length [53].

The long-term decay refers to the decrease of ai,j as the relative distance increases. As presented in Fig. 1 (c), visual-to-instruction information flow (i.e., instruction-to-visual self-attention) is less significant when is large and vice versa. This is favorable for pre-trained LLMs like LLaMA [63], as it aligns with language modeling intuition: pairs of tokens with long relative distance should have weaker connection. However, we observe that this property brings negative effect in multimodal alignment, in which case visual tokens far from instructions are less attended. This is not expected for multimodal alignment, as the connection between instruction tokens and visual tokens should not be attenuated by their relative distances. Pilot Experiment. We quantitatively examine the effect of RoPE long-term decay on LVLM object hallucination. To determine how object hallucination is influenced by the distance between visual and instruction tokens, we first train two LVLMs 3 following [46] with two different position alignment strategies, including: (raster-scan): it follows [46] the position alignment strategy on visual tokens Svision. Under this scenario, visual tokens follow sequential order, starting from upper-left corner 3Training details for these two models are in Appendix C.1. 4 Figure 2: Motivation Experiment. Given an image Iv with object Ov, we crop Ov and paste it to various spatial positions {v1, ..., vk} within pre-defined template. For every pasting position, we ask two LVLMs (Fb and Fr) if object Ov is in this template, where Fb refers to baseline model that follows raster-scan positional alignment strategy and Fr refers to model that resorts to reversal raster-scan position alignment strategy. The total number of correct responses at different pasting positions {v1, ..., vk} is reported in (a) and (b), which refers to results from model Fb and Fr, respectively. We observe that LVLM Fb are more likely to generate correct responses when pasting object Ov to lower region, while Fr are less hallucinated when pasting object Ov to upper region. Pasting positions with the most and the least correct responses are highlighted in solid-line and dotted-line red boxes. More details are provided in Appendix C.1. Best viewed in color. to lower-right corner of input 2-D visual features, row by row. The order of multimodal sequence is in format of {1, 2, ..., V, + 1, ..., + }.4 (reverse raster-scan): it reverses the sequential order of visual tokens Svision. In this case, sequence order of visual tokens starts from lower-right corner of input 2-D visual features to upper-left corner, row by row. The order of full multimodal sequence is in format of {V, 1, ..., 1, + 1, ..., + }. The reverse raster-scan model alters relative positions between visual tokens Svision and instruction tokens Sinstruct. For example, for instruction token wV +1, its relative distance to visual token wV changes from 1 to , resulting in weaker correlations between wV and wV +1. Our experiment setup is as follows. Given an image Iv, we follow [41] and ask questions in polling-base manner. Specifically, for an object Ov in image Iv, we follow the instruction format of is there a/an {object} in this image? to test our models. We crop region of object Ov from Iv according to its bounding box annotation and paste the cropped object over different positions of pre-defined image template (more details are covered in Appendix C.1). This results in new images {Iv1, ..., Ivk }, where {v1, ..., vk} indicates different pasting positions. We carry out these testing over images from [42] and aggregate correct responses with respect to pasting positions {v1, ..., vk}. RoPE affects object hallucination. The quantitative results of model and are visualized in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), respectively. For model b, we find that the response is less likely correct when object Ov is pasted on the upper part of the image, and it is more likely correct when object Ov is pasted on the lower part of image template. This is in stark contrast to experimental results: model responses are more likely to be correct when pasting image crop Ov on the upper part of images, while less likely to be correct when pasting position is the lower part. For model r, we note that visual tokens of lower part is far from instruction tokens in relative distance, corresponding to worse performance in object hallucination. We can thus conclude that RoPE long-term decay affects object hallucination for LVLMs, which requires special care to mitigate this issue. 4For demonstration purpose, we assume visual tokens are pre-pended before instruction tokens. For implementation, we adapt our design for flexible structure of multimodal sequences."

Our methodology is guided by two key principles, Alleviate the effect of long term decay on object hallucination by minimising overall relative distance between visual tokens Svision and instruction tokens Sinstruct. Mitigate performance discrepancy between raster scan model and reverse raster scan model r. Figure 3: An overview for Concentric Causal Attention. Left: Visual Token Re-organization. In comparison to raster-scan positional alignment in (a), we design concentric position alignment in (b) which shortens visual-instruction distance and retains spatial locality for 2-D data like images. Right: Concentric Causal Masking. By default as in (c), visual token attends to all preceding visual tokens in 1-D sequence. In contrast, our concentric causal attention in (d) models 2-D continuous positional dependencies among visual tokens, where center visual tokens attend to peripheral ones. Causal masks are by where in this case is 36 for demonstration purpose. Best viewed in color. , which diverges from spatial locality of 2-D visual features. Concentric Positions. In existing LVLMs such as LLaVA [46], visual tokens are perceived in 1-D continuous sequence (raster-scan position alignment as illustrated in Fig. 3 (a)) and concatenated with instruction tokens for multimodal alignment. We note that such row-by-row positional alignment strategy is not natural for 2-D image data, as it breaks spatial continuity on column dimension. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, information flow from visual token wm to wm+1 differs from that to wm+ Instead of adopting raster-scan sequential order, we design concentric positional alignment strategy as illustrated in Fig. 3 (b). In our design, position of visual tokens are organized in form of 2D concentric square, which increases from the peripheral of 2-D inputs to the center. In comparison to sequence order of {1, 2, ..., } for visual tokens Svision, such concentric positional alignment reduces relative distance between visual and instruction tokens Sinstruct. For visual token sequence of length and instruction token sequence of length , the maximum distance between visual tokens Svision and instruction tokens Sinstruct is ( 2 + 1). This concentric sequential ordering also better maintains 2-D spatial locality of visual tokens. Under this scenario, visual tokens that are closer in euclidean distances are causally correlated when position increases. Meanwhile, visual tokens that share the same position are correlated in visual self-attention. We note that such design 6 mitigates negative effect from RoPE long-term decay, via decreasing relative distances between Svision and Sinstruct while keeping causal inference scheme in pre-trained LLMs like LLaMA [64]. Concentric Causal Masking. Another part of our method resorts to modification of default causal attention masking towards our concentric visual token reorganization. As presented in Fig. 3 (c), query feature qm (derived from wm) only attends to preceding key features k<=m. Likewise for our method, we follow the same principle to force causal attention masking in 2-D visual inputs. We visualize our masking in Fig. 3 (d), where the total length of visual tokens are 36 (6 by 6). Combining visual token re-organization with concentric causal masking, our method models 2-D continuity for visual inputs and effectively mitigates the object hallucination issue brought by long-term decay in RoPE."

For greedy decoding, our model surpasses baseline model [46] by 3.2% while maintaining high object recall (80.3% v.s. 80.4%) for long-response generation (by setting max new tokens to 512). Note that longer textual responses suggests more significant distance between visual and instruction tokens, leading to higher hallucination rates [83], which can be improved by our approach that reduces relative distance between visual and textual tokens. Our results are comparable against LLaVA-RLHF [62] over this setup. On short responses, our model also outperforms baseline model by 2.8% on sentence-level and 0.8% on instance-level while maintaining high object recall. Our approach is also effective when using beam search for autoregressive decoding. We surpass the baseline by 0.8% and 0.5% on long-response generation, and 2.2% and 0.5% on short-response generation for CS and CI , respectively. Our approach is also complementary to OPERA [26]. In comparison to baseline model that using OPERA decoding, our approach are 1.8% and 1.1% better for CS and CI on long-response setting. We observe consistent performance gains in short-response generation (1.6% for CS and 0.9% for CI ). Quantitative evaluations on open-ended generation indicates importance of better positional alignment strategy and efficacy of our design."

            "content": "In this paper, we aim to mitigate object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). We perform in-depth analysis on correlation between object hallucination and Rotary Position Encoding, widely used positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. We find that LVLMs are more likely to hallucinate when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in 1D multimodal sequence, due to long-term decay in RoPE. To this end, we propose Concentric Causal Attention, simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that reduces relative distances between visual and instruction tokens, alleviating negative impact brought by RoPE long decay on object hallucination. Experimental results over multiple evaluation benchmarks supports our design, indicating importance of better position alignment strategy. Limitation. While this study shows improvements on mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs, our focus is only limited to handling of image-text inputs. We consider positional alignment strategy for other modalities of input data as future works, such as audio or video inputs that differs from image-text modalities."

As our approach is validated on LLaVA which constitutes CLIP, Vicuna and LLaMA, our trained models may inherit risks from these pre-trained visual encoders and large language models, including handling malicious inputs, hallucination or potential biases. We mitigate these issues following other LVLMs."

As Fig. 4 shows, RoPE is densely involved in LLaMA [63, 64], namely in all self-attention layers. This is architectually distinct from how positions are involved in ViT, where absolute PEs are only added once right after patch embedding layer. As most open-source LVLMs are using LLaMA as their language backbones [46, 84, 15, 67, 30, 79], it is noteworthy to study how RoPE may affect multimodal perception when we connect pretrained vision models (e.g., CLIP) with LLaMA. Figure 4: RoPE in LLaMA. schematic view for LLaMA where RoPE is highlighted, and an example illustration on how RoPE is applied over query or key feature. We use short input sequence with length of 4 and feature dimension of 4 for demonstration purpose. Input tokens are rotated with angles, subject to token positions.

C.1 Pilot Experiment Training. As described in Sec. 3 of main paper, we train baseline LVLM Fb that follows raster-scan positional alignment and another LVLM Fr that follows reversal raster-scan position alignment. For these two models, we carry out two-stage training following [46], except for the second stage we train both models for 20K steps with LoRA [25] due to resource limitations. Both experiments share the same training hyper-parameters as 665K full schedule training. Inference. We sample 3,000 annotations from COCO VAL 2014 [42] to carry out our motivation experiments. For each annotation with its corresponding image, we crop an object according to its bounding box and paste it within pre-defined template (a visually gray image), which is initialized with ImageNet [16] average pixel values. We test spatial positions {v1, ..., vk}, where is set to 144, resulting in resolution of 12 by 12 for both aggregated results in Fig. 2. Workflow on how we construct such synthetic data is further presented in Fig. 5. 15 Figure 5: Workflow illustration on how we synthesize testing data. Given an image and box annotation for one object instance, we crop it and paste it on template image, initialized with ImageNet mean pixel values. We paste every cropped region on every spatial position. Resulting data constitutes large amount of questions about object existence, diverse in spatial positions. C."

            "content": "D.1 Comparison over Multiple-Choice Benchmarks Beyond the scope of visual hallucination, we consider our proposed positional alignment as general approach for improving perception capability for LVLMs. We further evaluate our trained model over six benchmarks that examines LVLMs general perception capability, including SEED-Bench [36], ScienceQA [49], GQA [28], Vizwiz [22], MMBench [48] and MMStar [8] which evaluates LVLMs perception capability with multiple choice questions. We use lmms-eval [80] to do our comparison. For details of our evaluation benchmarks, SEED-Bench [36] consists of 19k multiple choice questions with human annotations, while spanning 12 evaluation dimensions, including both image and video data. MMBench [48] also examines LVLMs on general perception capabilities using wide range of tasks. We also present our comparisons on ScienceQA [49], Vizwiz [22] and GQA [28] that examines certain perception capability, like knowledge and relation. Note that MMStar [8] is vision-indispensible benchmark, which requires better visual grounding in trained LVLMs. We present our results against baseline model [46] in Tab. 5. In comparison to our baseline model LLaVA, our positional alignment approach achieves non-negligible gains across all six 16 benchmarks, without introducing additional computation during training. Such performance gains highlight potential of Concentric Causal Attention on enhancing general visual perception capability of LVLMs. Table 5: Evaluation on Multiple-Choice Benchmarks.

            "title": "NeurIPS Paper Checklist",
            "content": "1. Claims Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the papers contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the claims made in the paper. The claims match experimental results and reflect that our method can be expected to generalize to other settings. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Sec. 6 for limitations. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. The authors are encouraged to create separate \"Limitations\" section in their paper. The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on few datasets or with few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that arent acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. 19 The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide short proof sketch to provide intuition. Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 4. Experimental Result Reproducibility Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Sec. 5.1 in the main text and Sec. C.1 for training our models. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. If the paper includes experiments, No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. If the contribution is dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to hosted model (e.g., in the case of large language model), releasing of model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is new model (e.g., large language model), then there should either be way to access this model for reproducing the results or way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results. 5. Open access to data and code Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance. Guidelines: The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/ guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so No is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for new open-source benchmark). The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/ guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. 20 The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. 6. Experimental Setting/Details Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Sec. 5.1 in the main text for training details while Sec. 5 in the main text and Appendix D.1 for evaluation details. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material. 7. Experiment Statistical Significance Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: Error bars are not reported since training of LVLMs is computationally expensive. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to library function, bootstrap, etc.) The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report 2-sigma error bar than state that they have 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. 8. Experiments Compute Resources Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix for GPUs we use and execution time for training LVLMs. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. 21 The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didnt make it into the paper). 9. Code Of Ethics Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require deviation from the Code of Ethics. The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction). 10. Broader Impacts Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please find Broader Impacts in Appendix A. Guidelines: The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). 11. Safeguards Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We use open-sourced models and data only. We have properly cited original papers of our training and evaluation data. The license for assets used in this paper are under CC-BY 4.0. Our models in this paper will be under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. Released models that have high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 22 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make best faith effort. 12. Licenses for existing assets Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have properly cited original papers of our training and evaluation data. The licenses for models we use include CLIP, which is under MIT License, and LLaMA2, which is under Apache2.0. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include URL. The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. For scraped data from particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of dataset. For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the assets creators. 13. New Assets Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. 14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review."
