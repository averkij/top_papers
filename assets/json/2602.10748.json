In addition, the Subject reliability of the entire KG depends not only on the correctness of these atomic facts, but also on the way they are interconnected [8, 50].1 crucial step after the creation of the KG is assessing the veracity of its facts [23, 51]. This involves determining how accurately the data reflects real-world entities, relationships, and phenomena. Fact validation presents significant challenge and is expensive [36, 37]. The most reliable option involves manual or computer-assisted annotation by human experts [42, 66]. However, this process is extremely time-consuming [12, 43]. Since experts often need to audit facts relying on multiple external reference sources, in large-scale KGs (e.g., DBpedia [33] or YAGO [22]), verifying each individual triple can take several minutes, making manual inspection and correction of errors infeasible at scale. As result, automated fact-checking methods [11, 14, 58, 62, 63], often based on rules and enforceable constraints [10, 40], have emerged as more scalable alternatives to address the time and cost limitations of human-based solutions. While these methods are effective for well-defined and frequently occurring facts [29]), they fall short when it comes to generalizing across the wide variety of facts found in real-world KGs. Manual definition, on the other hand, is both difficult and expensive. Therefore, (semi-) automatic methods that extract rules and constraints can be employed. Nonetheless, these methods predominantly cater to rules that identify frequent positive instances and encounter difficulties with cases pertaining to infrequent facts or necessitate the application of negative rules [45]. These limitations have led to the adoption of fact-checking systems with machine/deep learning solutions [17]. In this realm, viable approach could be to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for fact-checking, as they have demonstrated near-human-level performance on various tasks [46]. Within this framework, LLMs offer various advantages: they can extract contextual information from text, comprehend the semantics of statements, and possess an extensive internal knowledge base [48, 65]. However, current LLMs generate hallucinated and unfaithful responses [60]. Additionally, recent work has highlighted that LLMs are particularly problematic for fact validation tasks, exhibiting systematic biases and knowledge gaps that can affect their reliability [59]. To combat the limitations caused by knowledge cutoff and hallucination in LLMs, current systems built on top of LLMs often implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach in which the LLM is supplemented with data from external sources to improve their responses [28]. However, despite all the recent progress in LLM research and the capability of LLMs to tackle wide range of tasks, there appear to be no existing benchmarks specifically measuring the performance of LLMs in KG fact validation [51]. Hence, we present FactCheck, general-purpose benchmark designed to assess LLMs in the validation of KG facts across three 1We use the terms fact, statement, and triple interchangeably depending on the context. EDBT 26, 24-27 March 2026, Tampere (Finland) Shami et al. principal dimensions: (1) LLM internal knowledge; (2) external evidence through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and, (3) synthesized knowledge from multiple models. FactCheck relies on validation pipeline that transforms structured triples into natural language statements for evaluation of their factual accuracy. The validation procedure begins with KG entities and relations, derives structured triples, checks them against reliable sources, and calculates accuracy scores. FactCheck is driven by the following research questions (RQs): RQ1: How effective are LLMs at KG fact-checking when relying only on their internal knowledge? RQ2: Does external evidence improves the ability of LLMs to factcheck KGs? RQ3: Does aggregating predictions from multiple LLMs lead to more reliable validation of KG facts? RQ1 targets recent debate concerning LLMs functioning as Knowledge Bases (KBs), aiming to evaluate how factual and complete the internal knowledge of an LLM is, for both previously seen and unseen knowledge [19, 20, 71]. We do not prompt the LLM to retrieve knowledge to evaluate its completeness and accuracy. Instead, we ask the LLM to judge the accuracy of externally provided facts, which requires it to depend solely on its internal knowledge. Our focus is directed towards this research approach, acknowledging that studies indicate querying an LLM for the verification of information accuracy produces more favorable outcomes compared to prompting it to generate or assess its own content [27, 31]. RQ2 targets the effectiveness of augmenting LLMs with external evidence to improve KG fact-checking, contributing to ongoing discussions around RAG and its role in factual verification [28, 53, 70]. While classical RAG approaches often outperform LLMs that rely solely on internal knowledge, recent findings indicate that RAG effectiveness can diminish in complex or multi-turn settings, where context management and evidence selection become more error-prone [32]. Moreover, integrating external evidence can introduce contextual bias, where the model overly trusts retrieved content [34]. With FactCheck, we aim to foster research on whether and under what conditions external evidence helps KG fact validation, to what extent, and under which conditions. RQ3 targets growing body of work investigating whether aggregating outputs from multiple LLMs can lead to more accurate or reliable factual verification [7, 54]. While individual LLMs may vary in factual accuracy, reasoning patterns, and susceptibility to hallucinations, recent studies suggest that combining multiple models via voting, consensus, or arbitration mechanisms can mitigate individual model biases and increase robustness [64, 67]. However, this approach introduces its own challenges, including disagreement resolution, scaling cost, and the risk of amplifying shared misconceptions among models trained on overlapping data. FactCheck can help explore whether ensemble-style reasoning from multiple LLMs can improve the reliability of KG fact-checking. Contributions. We propose FactCheck, benchmark for KG fact validation using LLMs, which comes with several advantages: (1) FactCheck integrates various LLMs for KG fact validation. The benchmark evaluates these models using both their internal knowledge and external evidence through RAG. It also explores consensus-based verification via majority voting strategies. Experiments with mid-sized (79B parameters) and commercial LLMs highlight the challenges of the task. (2) FactCheck is built upon three real-world KG datasets: FactBench [14], YAGO [43], and DBpedia [38], covering broad spectrum of knowledge, ranging from everyday facts to complex, domain-specific information, ensuring diverse and representative evaluation of fact validation capabilities. (3) FactCheck includes large-scale RAG dataset featuring several questions paired with corresponding Google Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The dataset comprises 2M+ documents covering broad range of factual information, making it one of the most comprehensive and publicly available RAG resources for KG fact validation. FactCheck includes mock API that simulates real search APIs, allowing users to reproduce data retrieval, test retrieval methods, and extend RAG methods without direct access to search engines. (4) dedicated web application (https://factcheck.dei.unipd.it/), enabling users to visually explore and analyze each step of the verification process, also featuring error analysis modules that categorize reasoning errors, enabling systematic identification of LLM limitations in fact-checking scenarios. (5) FactCheck enables comprehensive evaluation by combining performance metrics with resource usage analysis. Model predictions are evaluated against gold-standard labels to assess accuracy and reliability. The benchmark also tracks computational costs (inference time and token usage). Evaluation with different methodologies and datasets highlights the difficulty and inherent complexity of the fact validation task in KG. The main insights of our work are three-fold: First, while LLMs show promising capabilities in KG fact validation, they are still far from being reliably deployed in real-world validation scenarios. Second, integrating external knowledge through RAG yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches at significantly higher computational costs. Finally, consensus-based strategies using multiple models are unable to consistently outperform individual models. Altogether, these results highlight the tasks difficulty and complexity, underscoring the need for dedicated benchmark to drive progress. Outline. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related work on automated KG fact-checking and benchmark development. In Section 3, we introduce the FactCheck benchmark. We detail the FactCheck construction in Section 4, covering both dataset selection and RAG corpus creation. Section 5 outlines the experimental setup, with results discussed in Section 6. Section 7 provides qualitative error analysis of failure cases. Finally, in Section 8, we draw final remarks."

Unstructured text, webpages, and search snippets given statement. KLinker, on the other hand, focuses on discovering relational paths that link entities to each other. COPPAL [61] proposes corroborative meta-path to find statement-supporting paths. These approaches focus only on positive evidential paths and are heavily restricted due to the incomplete nature of KGs. Approaches like PredPath [57] attempt to utilize both negative and positive paths to cover broader range of factual statements. PredPath assigns weights to discriminative predicate paths by considering only correct examples, ignoring counterexamples. This can lead to improperly weighted rules. In addition, Kim and Choi [29] presents an unsupervised rule-based approach that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches in this area. They calculate truth score for the given statement by finding positive and negative evidential paths in KG, generating examples for the training phase, creating model for learning from positive and negative rules, and scoring the triple based on established evidence. While these methods are effective, they rely entirely on the underlying KG, which may contain errors or be incomplete; thus, they cannot be used to assess the accuracy of the KG itself. (2) External Evidence-Based Fact Checking. DeFacto [14] is supervised learning method that validates KG triples using evidence retrieved on the Web. To compute an evidence score, this method integrates trustworthiness metrics with textual evidence. Syed et al. [62] proposed fact validation method that uses textual evidence from static reference corpus as external knowledge. They verbalized triples into natural language, queried search engine to retrieve similar corpus sentences, and then extracted evidence and features from these sentences to estimate each KG triples confidence with trained model. Recently, Boylan et al. [5] introduced KGValidator, framework for the automatic evaluation of KG completion models using LLMs. KGValidator assesses predicted triples by leveraging multiple sources of context, including the LLMs internal knowledge, user-provided textual documents, and web resources. In contrast to this methodological contribution, FactCheck focuses on providing the supporting evaluation infrastructure i.e., datasets, metrics, and curated evidence corpora needed to systematically assess and compare such validation approaches. Aligning with prior work that incorporates external sources for fact verification [5, 14, 62], FactCheck allows LLMs to employ external evidence retrieved from Web SERPs. Additionally, FactCheck offers several LLM-based baselines, enabling comparative evaluation of LLM with external evidence-driven solutions. Moreover, FactCheck assesses LLM performance across three real-world KG datasets (13,530 facts) tailored for the task, supported by 2M+ retrieved documents as external evidence."

            "content": "4, 409 Question-Answer pairs spanning five domains and eight question categories. To simulate realistic usage scenarios, CRAG offers mock APIs for web and KG searches. The benchmark specifically targets challenges such as answering less popular or rapidly evolving facts, assessing LLM performance across varying levels of entity popularity and temporal relevance. While CRAG and FactCheck both utilize RAG, they address fundamentally different problems with distinct evaluation goals. Indeed, FactCheck evaluates KG fact validation, prioritizing accuracy and consistency. CRAG cannot replace FactCheck because high-performing QA models often fail at the strict, granular logic required to validate isolated KG triples. Additionally, FactCheck provides detailed information on computational costs and resource efficiency, both aspects not extensively covered by CRAG. Hence, although related, these benchmarks address different aspects of factual verification. Beyond CRAG, there are several pipelines and shared tasks for fact-checking purposes targeting textual claims. RumourEval [15] evaluated classification systems by analyzing social media posts by stance detection and rumor veracity verification, employing dataset containing data from Twitter and Reddit. CLEF CheckThat! [1] offers sentence-level subjectivity detection in news articles. ClaimBuster [2] introduced an automated end-to-end fact-checking pipeline integrating claim detection, matching, and verification. As said, these benchmarks primarily target unstructured textual claims and cannot be used for KG fact verification. Few datasets have been proposed for KG verification [14, 38, 43]. key one is FactBench [14], built from DBpedia [33] and Freebase [4] KGs to evaluate validation systems on systematic errors. Other datasets include YAGO [43] and DBpedia [38], which consist of samples drawn from their respective KGs and manually annotated by experts for correctness. While these datasets have been employed in both manual and automated verification settings, they have seen minimal to no use with LLM-based approaches. Hence, we employ FactBench, YAGO, and DBpedia in FactCheck, as they capture complementary aspects of fact verification challenges, enabling multifaceted evaluation of LLM-based strategies. Another related dataset is FactKG [30], designed for fact verification over KGs. However, FactKG uses KGs to verify textual claims, whereas our work takes the opposite direction: using external evidence to help LLMs validate KG facts."

If models output is non-conformant, the system triggers reprompting, explicitly flagging the non-compliance. Responses that repeatedly fail to meet the criteria are marked as invalid. We consider both zeroand few-shot settings. In the few-shot setting, we include small set of correctly evaluated triples as examples to guide the models understanding of the task.

            "content": "In the Triple Transformation phase (1), structured KG triples are converted into human-readable sentences. This transformation is performed using an LLM to address the substantial variability in how different KGs represent 𝑆, 𝑃, 𝑂 data. KGs follow heterogeneous conventions for encoding triples, and these source-specific formats often hinder effective information retrieval. Common issues include (1) KG-specific namespaces (e.g., dbpedia.org/resource/:term:); (2) special notation such as underscores or camelCase (e.g., isMarriedTo, Alexander_III_of_Russia); and (3) predicates that lack sufficient grammatical or semantic context. Such representations can restrict search results to the original source pages from which the triples were extracted, thereby introducing retrieval bias and limiting coverage during evaluation. By contrast, natural language reformulations facilitate the discovery of broader range of relevant web sources. We define this process as transformation function 𝑠 = 𝑓LLM (𝑡) that maps triple 𝑡 to natural language sentence 𝑠. In the Question Generation and Ranking phase (2), for any given sentence 𝑠, we prompt an LLM to generate set of candidate queries Q𝑠 = {𝑞1, 𝑞2, . . . , 𝑞𝑘𝑞 }. The goal of generating multiple questions is to broaden the semantic coverage of the original triple, improving the chances of retrieving relevant evidence even when the input is ambiguous, noisy, or underspecified. Generating multiple questions also helps mitigate the paraphrasing bias that the LLM may introduce when turning triples into natural language. By formulating several distinct questions, we broaden the range of possible interpretations of given triple, thereby weakening the link to any single facet that might otherwise be imposed by one particular LLM-generated paraphrase. To identify the most informative queries, we apply cross-encoder model (jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en), which corresponds to the normalized dot product between the cross-encoders final representation and learned relevance vector (i.e., sigmoid-scaled dot-product score). This score reflects the semantic proximity between candidate query 𝑞 Q𝑠 and the original sentence 𝑠. The resulting set is Qranked = {𝑞 (1), 𝑞 (2), . . . , 𝑞 (𝑘𝑞 ) }, where sim(𝑞 (𝑖 ), 𝑠) sim(𝑞 (𝑖+1), 𝑠) for all 𝑖 {1, 2, . . . , 𝑘𝑞 1}. We retain 𝑠 Benchmarking Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Validation EDBT 26, 24-27 March 2026, Tampere (Finland) the top-𝜏 queries, denoted as Q𝜏 𝜏 [0, 1] to ensure only the most relevant queries are used. 𝑠 , using predefined threshold In the Document Retrieval and Filtering phase (3), we issue each query in Q𝜏 𝑠 to Google Search using specific parameters to ensure consistency. We set lr = lang_en and hl = en to enforce English content and interface settings, and gl = us to standardize the geolocation to the United States, thereby mitigating local personalization bias. Using num = 100, we collect the top 𝑛max = 100 retrieved webpages, denoted as (𝑞) = {𝑤1, 𝑤2, . . . , 𝑤𝑛max }. For each webpage 𝑤𝑖 (𝑞), we extract its textual content, denoted as text(𝑤𝑖 ). The set of documents retrieved for given query 𝑞 is then defined as (𝑞) = {𝑑𝑖 = text(𝑤𝑖 ) 𝑤𝑖 (𝑞)}. To obtain the full document pool associated with the original triple 𝑡, we take the union over all queries in Q𝜏 𝑠 (𝑞). To ensure evidence independence and avoid circular verification, we define SKG as the set of original KG sources for instance, Wikipedia entries when verifying facts from DBpedia and FactBench datasets. We use this set to filter out any retrieved documents that directly originate from these sources. The resulting filtered document set is defined as Dfiltered = {𝑑 source(𝑑) SKG}. 𝑠 : = (cid:208)𝑞 Q𝜏 Finally, in the Document Processing and Chunking phase (4), we use cross-encoder to identify the 𝑘𝑑 most relevant documents with respect to the sentence 𝑠. For each document 𝑑 Dfiltered, similarity score sim𝑑 (𝑑, 𝑠) is computed using the same approach as above. The top 𝑘𝑑 documents, ranked by similarity, form the final set Dfinal = {𝑑1, 𝑑2, . . . , 𝑑𝑘𝑑 }. Each document in Dfinal is segmented into smaller, overlapping passages using sliding window chunking strategy. These chunks are subsequently used as contextual input in the LLM prompt during the fact validation stage."

Positive (correct) facts are sourced from DBpedia and Freebase, while negative (incorrect) facts are generated systematically by altering the correct ones ensuring adherence to domain and range constraints. We use configuration with proportion of positive facts of 𝜇 = 0.54, achieved by mixing correct facts with incorrect ones generated through various negative sampling strategies [37]. YAGO is an evaluation dataset sampled from the YAGO KG, originally introduced by Ojha and Talukdar [43] and widely adopted for KG accuracy estimation [12, 36, 37]. It comprises 1, 386 facts spanning 16 distinct predicates, with an average of 1.69 facts per entity. All facts are annotated by crowdworkers, resulting in gold standard accuracy of 𝜇 = 0.99. This high accuracy presents unique challenge for fact-checking, as LLMs may be biased toward classifying all facts as correct, thereby inflating performance metrics.

It was constructed using combination of sampling and active learning techniques, with both expert and layman annotators involved to ensure high annotation quality.

We constructed RAG dataset comprising questions derived from KG facts and corresponding search results. This dataset was created as support to effectively evaluate LLM performance in fact validation tasks involving external knowledge. The dataset consists of two main components: the generated questions and their associated search results obtained from Google SERPs. For Questions, we used an LLM to generate 𝑘𝑞 = 10 distinct questions for each transformed triple 𝑠, aiming to explore different facets of the underlying fact. For dataset construction, we included all questions that were successfully extracted from the models output. Each question is published along with its corresponding similarity score, computed with respect to the transformed triple.

Each question is assigned similarity score 𝛿 [0, 1] that quantifies its semantic closeness to the transformed triple. Across all questions, the similarity scores exhibit mean of 𝜇𝛿 = 0.63 and median of 𝛿 = 0.66. The standard deviation is 𝜎𝛿 = 0.25, indicating moderate variability. The first quartile is 𝑄1 = 0.44 and the third is 𝑄3 = 0.84, resulting in an Inter Quartile Range (IQR) of IQR = 𝑄3 𝑄1 = 0.40, which confirms substantial variation in similarity scores across the dataset. To further analyze this distribution, we categorize the questions into three similarity tiers: high similarity (𝛿 0.70), constituting 45% of the dataset; medium similarity (0.40 𝛿 < 0.70), accounting for 34%; and low similarity (𝛿 < 0.40), making up the remaining 21%. This distribution shows that 79% of the dataset consists of questions with at least moderate similarity to the transformed triple (𝛿 0.40), and nearly half show high similarity. This range of similarity levels covers both semantically close and more loosely related interpretations of each fact. Regarding Google Search Results, for each fact, we submitted the transformed original triple along with the top three generated questions ranked by their similarity scores to Google Search. After parsing the HTML responses, we retrieved each URL using the GRequests Python library. The content of the resulting webpages was extracted using the newspaper4k 2 Python package. The corpus consists of 𝐷 = 2,090,305 documents across 13,530 triples. Each triple 𝑡 is linked to 𝑑𝑡 documents, with min(𝑑𝑡 ) = 0, max(𝑑𝑡 ) = 337, mean 𝜇𝑑𝑡 = 154.51, and median 𝑑𝑡 = 160. The slightly higher median indicates mild negative skew, with most triples having document counts around or just above the mean. We define Etext 𝐷 as the subset of documents with empty text content. This subset contains Etext = 263, 515 documents, representing the 13% of the entire collection. Consequently, the text coverage rate i.e., the proportion of documents presenting text content is 1 Etext/𝐷 = 0.87 (87%). This high coverage rate supports the reliability of the constructed document collection. 2https://newspaper4k.readthedocs.io Table 3: Summary of average time and token usage for each step in the RAG dataset generation pipeline.

Time Avg. tokens Question Generation Get documents (Google pages) Fetch documents for each triple 9.60 sec 3.60 sec 350 sec 672.58 In Table 3, we report the time consumption and token expenditure incurred during the generation of the RAG dataset. Overall, question generation requires an average of 9.60 seconds per fact, whereas the complete Google results retrieval process takes approximately 364.4 seconds. To ensure fairness and reproducibility in evaluation, we generated all questions and collected the corresponding Google SERP results in advance. This provides consistent evidence base for LLMs, avoiding discrepancies caused by changes in live search outputs. The complete dataset is publicly available on our HuggingFace project page and accessible via the mock API.3 Mock API. In FactCheck, we integrate web search-like API for content retrieval to simulate realistic scenarios for RAG. This API facilitates reproducible benchmarking by offering standardized access to pre-collected search data, thereby removing temporal variability in search results. For each fact in the considered datasets, we issued queries using both the transformed triple and the top three generated questions. We stored the first 100 results for each query from Google SERP, and subsequently retrieved and preserved the actual content of each linked webpage. As previously discussed, we filtered out sources directly related to the original fact to avoid circular verification. We implemented standardized endpoints that emulate conventional web search APIs while returning consistent results from our dataset. Through this mock API, researchers can perform identical retrieval operations across multiple experimental runs, ensuring fair comparisons between different LLM configurations, prompting strategies, and verification approaches. The mock API can be accessed at https://factcheck-api.dei.unipd.it/. Full documentation is available on GitHub."

This analysis is organized around the three key research questions introduced earlier. RQ1. Table 5 provides an overview of the evaluation results concerning the internal knowledge capabilities of LLMs. The analysis employs three verification paradigms: Direct Knowledge Assessment (DKA), as well as Guided Iterative Verification in both zero-shot (GIV-Z) and few-shot (GIV-F) contexts. We observe sensible performance variability across models and datasets. In the FactBench dataset, Gemma2 achieves the robust capabilities across both classes, reaching 0.79 for 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) and 0.76 for 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) in the GIV-F setting. In contrast, GPT-4o mini shows distinct performance asymmetry. While its detection of incorrect facts is comparable to other models 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) 0.71, its ability to verify true facts is consistently lower 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) [0.48, 0.52]. This finding challenges the prevailing view that commercial or larger models outperform smaller or open-source counterparts. Among the datasets, FactBench appears to be the most favorable for internal knowledge evaluation, as most models maintain reasonable balance between 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) and 𝐹 1(𝐹 ). On the other hand, YAGO proves to be the most challenging due to its large nomber of correct facts. While models achieve high 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) scores (up to 0.92), the 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) scores are negligible (0.01 to 0.03). This drastic discrepancy indicates strong model bias toward positive classifications, which hinders the detection of rare incorrect facts in highly imbalanced contexts. In comparison, DBpedia yields intermediate results; most models achieve respectable 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) scores [0.53, 0.89], yet they struggle to reliably identify incorrect information, with 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) values generally remaining below 0.40. Notably, the few-shot setup (GIV-F) consistently outperforms both DKA and GIV-Z settings. For instance, on FactBench, Mistral improves from 0.68 (DKA) to 0.81 (GIV-Z), while its performance on false claims remains stable around 0.73.. These gains are particularly pronounced for mid-tier models, which benefit more from structured prompting and exemplar-based guidance. By contrast, already well-performing models such as Gemma2 show relatively smaller performance gains. Finding 1: Open-source models, such as Gemma2 or Mistral, outperform commercial alternatives like GPT-4o mini when relying exclusively on internal knowledge. Moreover, few-shot prompting consistently enhances performance, although the degree of improvement is influenced by dataset characteristics such as class balance and label distribution. RQ2. We evaluate the performance of the RAG methodology across all models and datasets, and then compare it against the internal knowledge-based approaches in Table 5. Overall, RAG achieves the highest performance across nearly all experimental settings. In particular, for the FactBench dataset, RAG delivers substantial improvements: for example, Qwen2.5 achieves 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) of 0.89, compared to 0.55 in the DKA setting. This trend holds across evaluated models, including GPT-4o mini, which shows marked increase in performance rising more than 25% in both 𝐹 1 scores when external evidence is incorporated. However, the impact of RAG varies significantly across datasets. FactBench and YAGO show the greatest absolute gains, likely due to their broader diversity of factual content. In contrast, Dbpedia exhibits minimal improvements or even slight performance degradation in some cases. This may be attributed to schema diversity, which can complicate the retrieval process and diminish the relevance of the extracted evidence. Finding 2: Incorporating external evidence via RAG represents promising path to high-accuracy fact validation. However, its effectiveness is dependent on dataset characteristics. RQ3. We investigate the effectiveness of multi-model consensus strategies, applying majority voting across our four opensource models. In cases of ties, we introduce tie-breaking mechanism using either higher-parameter variants or commercial model (GPT-4o mini). Table 7 summarizes the results. Multi-model consensus provides more reliable performance across internal knowledge settings (DKA, GIV-Z, and GIV-F), although it does not consistently outperform all individual models. In many cases, it stabilizes performance across varying conditions rather than providing top results. Interestingly, the choice of tie-breaking model has minimal influence on final performance.

This suggests that the majority vote mechanism effectively captures the most reliable signal, and the specific choice of arbitrator is less impactful than having consistent tie-resolution strategy in place. Our consistency analysis, shown in Table 6, further reveals that agreement among models increases with methodological complexity. For instance, RAG results in lower tie rates ranging from 6% to 9% compared to 21% to 26% in GIV-Z. This reinforces the notion that external evidence not only improves individual model performance but also enhances cross-model alignment. However, this increased agreement may also reflect stronger influence of shared contextual evidence, potentially reducing reliance on internal knowledge and thereby introducing uniformity at the cost of model individuality or specificity.

While it does not always outperform individual models, it mitigates the impact of weaker ones. The specific choice of arbitrator has limited impact. Moreover, external evidence promotes greater model alignment, though care must be taken to avoid overfitting to contextual bias. Computational Efficiency. Beyond accuracy metrics, we evaluate the computational efficiency of different approaches. Table 8 reports execution times ( 𝜃 , in seconds) for fact validation using the four open-source LLMs across the three reference datasets. Within each dataset, DKA yields the lowest execution times, ranging from 0.21 to 0.30 seconds on FactBench, from 0.19 to 0.31 seconds on YAGO, and from 0.24 to 0.37 seconds on DBpedia. GIV-Z shows an increase over DKA, with approximately double the execution time on FactBench and YAGO, such as an increase from 0.18 to 0.40 seconds on Qwen2.5 for FactBench. GIV-F requires more time than GIV-Z, with values reaching up to 0.78 seconds. RAG results in the highest execution times across all datasets and models, with values including 2.73 seconds on Llama3.1 for FactBench and over 2.5 seconds for several models on DBpedia. The comparison within each dataset indicates that, as expected, RAG incurs the greatest computational cost, often exceeding DKA by factor of six or more. The increase in execution time follows the progression from DKA to GIV-Z to GIV-F to RAG in all configurations. This pattern suggests direct relationship between the methodological complexity of the verification strategy and its computational cost. On different note, multi-model consensus can be parallelized, meaning that inference latency is bounded by the slowest model rather than the sum of all models. In practice, if models exhibit varying response times (e.g., 0.30.5 seconds), consensus inference requires waiting for the slowest response, resulting in slightly higher latency compared to selecting only the fastest model. Tie-breaking further adds inference overhead, as it requires an additional model query. Moreover, the coordination and resource allocation across multiple models introduce minor but non-negligible computational overhead. Despite this, consensus brings benefits: the trustworthiness of the predictions increases due to the aggregation of diverse model perspectives.

Multi-model consensus results are shown with hatching, and the red dotted line indicates the guess rate. Figure 3: Trade-off analysis between computational cost ( 𝜃 ) and verification performance (𝐹 1(𝐹 ) and 𝐹 1(𝑇 )). The dashed line represents the Pareto frontier, highlighting configurations that achieve optimal efficiency (highest accuracy for given time budget). To characterize the balance between predictive accuracy and computational expense, we examined the Pareto efficiency of our methods across the different models (Figure 3). This analysis reveals clear separation in the utility of each strategy: RAGbased techniques generally cluster in the upper-right quadrant, especially with respect to the 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) metric, indicating that their increased latency (1.6s2.9s) is exchanged for enhanced detection of false claims. Conversely, DKA setups dominate the high-speed regime, delivering sub-second inference times (<0.3 s) that are appropriate for latency-sensitive use cases, albeit with lower sensitivity. The Pareto frontier indicates that mid-range approaches such as GIV-F (particularly when paired with Gemma2 and Mistral) strike an attractive trade-off, attaining competitive accuracy at times even exceeding RAG on the 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) metric while incurring substantially less computational cost than full retrieval-based systems. Benchmarking Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Validation EDBT 26, 24-27 March 2026, Tampere (Finland) Finding 4: Computational efficiency varies widely across methods. On the one hand, RAG requires up to 10 more processing time compared to internal knowledge approaches. On the other hand, consensus strategies can be parallelized to ensure only modest latency increases with respect to internal knowledge methods. locations, or teams. Geographic/Nationality Errors (E4): Information about places or national affiliations is inconsistent with the context. Genre/Classification Errors (E5): The model miscategorizes movies, genres, or creative works connected to individuals or studios. Identifier/Biographical Errors (E6): Identifiers or biographical fact, such as award names, are inaccurate. Cross-Dataset Generalization and Stability. To assess the generalization capabilities and stability of LLM-based fact validation, we analyze the performance across different methods and aggregation strategies, which are visualized in the bar charts (Figure 2). The plots display the 𝐹 1 scores for the True class (left chart) and False class (right chart) ranked by performance. The red dashed line represents the Random Guessing baseline, which sits at approximately 0.62 for 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) and 0.29 for 𝐹 1(𝐹 ), and this reflects the underlying class distribution challenges in the dataset. RAG demonstrates the most consistent robustness. In the 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) chart, which typically represents the harder task of identifying incorrect facts, RAG-based methods and their aggregations dominate the top rankings. On the other hand, GIV-F (blue bars) exhibits high variance. Although Mistral (GIV-F) achieves the absolute highest peak in the 𝐹 1(𝑇 ) chart (0.88), other models using the same strategy, such as gpt-4o-mini, perform drastically lower at 0.40. This result falls significantly below the random guessing baseline and suggests that while GIV-F can prompt high recall for true facts in specific models, it lacks the stability of RAG. The DKA (red bars) methodology generally occupies the middle-to-lower tier, particularly in the 𝐹 1(𝐹 ) analysis, which indicates that reliance on internal parametric knowledge alone is often insufficient for distinguishing false claims. Finally, the aggregation methods denoted as agg-consconsistently appear in the upper echelons of both charts. This confirms that ensemble reasoning, specifically majority voting strategies, effectively mitigates the volatility of individual models and smoothes out the noise observed in strategies like GIV-Z and GIV-F. Finding 5: RAG offers the strongest cross-dataset generalization, consistently outperforming internal knowledge methods in detecting false claims. Some GIV-F models reach top performance on True facts but are highly volatile. Notably, several internal knowledge methods perform below Random Guessing, showing that poor methodology can degrade reasoning to below coin-flip baseline. Thus, consensus-based aggregation remains essential for stability and reducing model-specific bias."

As shown in Table 9, E4 errors form the predominant challenge in FactCheck. In addition, we extended this analysis on the DBpedia dataset using the stratification and topic modeling from Marchesin et al. [38] to understand the impact of fact popularity and domain. The results reveal that error rates decrease in partitions representing common knowledge and domains like Education and News yield lower error rates, while Architecture and Transportation remain more challenging. The entire verification process and the error analysis presented here can be interactively interpreted and visualized using our web-based platform available at https://factcheck.dei.unipd.it/ [55]. To study how the models complement each other, we examined overlaps in their predictions using UpSet plots [35]. As illustrated in Figure 4, the largest intersection generally corresponds to facts correctly predicted by all four models, indicating that opensource LLMs share much of their internal knowledge as well as their error profiles. This agreement is most pronounced in the RAG setting, where common external evidence steers the models toward the same conclusions, thereby reducing variance. GIV-Z, however, departs from this pattern: the all-model intersection shrinks markedly relative to DKA (from roughly 4,600 to about 3,200) and is replaced by stronger pairwise overlaps (e.g., between Qwen2.5 and Gemma2). This pattern suggests that zero-shot prompting leads to more heterogeneous reasoning trajectories and greater disagreement among models. In contrast, GIV-F restores stronger consensus, raising the all-model intersection to over 5,200, indicating that few-shot demonstrations effectively harmonize model behavior. Overall, the limited true complementarity among models may explain why consensus methods stabilize predictions but rarely outperform the best single model."

            "content": "EDBT 26, 24-27 March 2026, Tampere (Finland) Shami et al. (a) DKA (b) GIV-Z (c) GIV-F (d) RAG Figure 4: Intersection of correct predictions across models. Bars show the number of correct samples by the specific combination of models indicated by the connected dots below. on three real-world datasets included in FactCheck FactBench, YAGO, and DBpedia yielded several key findings. First, opensource LLMs, such as Gemma2, achieve promising verification performance, with 𝐹 1 scores up to 0.79 and 0.76 using internal knowledge alone and exceeding 0.89 when augmented with RAG. Second, RAG improves performance across most settings, though at significant computational cost being roughly 10 slower than other methods. Third, multi-model consensus mitigates errors and provides more reliable responses than single-model predictions, in particular when relying on internal knowledge. At the same time, we also identified several limitations: (1) dataset-specific challenges, such as class imbalance in YAGO and schema diversity in DBpedia; (2) infrastructure constraints, including 0.08% retrieval failure rate due to network issues and regional restrictions; and (3) content filtering in hosted deployments, such as blocked factual content on sensitive topics for Azures GPT-4o-mini. Hence, FactCheck advances the study of LLMs factual reasoning by leveraging the structured semantics of KGs, unlike prior benchmarks focused on unstructured claims or general-domain QA. It provides controlled environment for reproducible, finegrained analyses of model behavior, including internal knowledge use, retrieval effectiveness, and multi-model interactions. As robust testbed, FactCheck supports the development of new prompting strategies, model architectures, and retrieval techniques for fact validation. By releasing it publicly, we aim to promote transparency, collaboration, and faster progress toward trustworthy, scalable KG validation systems. Looking ahead, our findings suggest several promising research directions. First, fine-tuning or pretraining LLMs for KG fact validation could help mitigate limitations from imbalanced datasets. Second, hybrid retrieval strategies that combine structured KG traversal with unstructured web data may enhance retrieval quality, particularly for datasets like DBpedia. Finally, the benchmark can be extended to support the evaluation of factverification systems that also leverage logical rules in the KG, for example by exploiting the ontologies on which the KG is based (e.g., using transitivity, domain/range constraints, and other properties to assess the correctness and reliability of triples).
