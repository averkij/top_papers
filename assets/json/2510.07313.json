            "content": "Wrist-view observations play central role in visionlanguageaction (VLA) models because they directly capture the fine-grained handobject interactions that underlie precise manipulation. However, most large-scale robotic datasets provide only limited wrist-view coverage (Ebert et al., 2024; Mandlekar et al., 2018; Collaboration et al., 2025), producing substantial and practically important gap between abundant anchor (third-person) views and scarce wrist-centric recordings. Models pretrained on external perspectives therefore often underperform when tasks require detailed wristcentric perception or control. Collecting wrist-view data at scale is expensive: it demands extra sensors, careful calibration, and specialized recording setups. While world models have been proposed for data completion and synthesis (Wang et al., 2025c; Yang et al., 2023; Zhen et al., 2025), existing approaches are not designed to close the anchor-to-wrist gap in realistic, dynamic manipulation settings. Many of them (Liao et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024) require wrist-view first frame as condition and thus cannot generate wrist-view sequences from anchor views alone. This raises natural question: can we enrich existing third-person datasets with automatically generated, geometrically consistent wrist-view sequences that support both perception and control? However, bridging anchor views to wrist views is highly challenging: First, scenes are dynamic and dominated by articulated arms and manipulators that cause severe, time-varying occlusions. Second, the target wrist perspective is often not seen during training of current viewpoint transfer methods. Third, geometric reconstructions from anchor views are typically sparse and temporally inconsistent, making na√Øve view-synthesis prone to spatial or temporal artifacts (Liu et al., 2024). To address these challenges, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that synthesizes wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. Motivated by recent advances in visual geometric modeling (Wang et al., 2025b) and diffusion-based video synthesis (Blattmann et al., 2023), WristWorld features two-stage pipeline that explicitly enforces both geometric and temporal consistency. In the Reconstruction stage, we extend VGGT with dedicated wrist head that encodes the extreme viewpoint transform and estimates geometrically consistent 4D point clouds and wrist-view camera poses. novel Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) loss is proposed to enforce alignment between 2D correspondences and the reconstructed 3D/4D geometry, improving spatial fidelity. In the Generation stage, diffusion-based video generator conditioned on the reconstructed wrist projections and CLIP-encoded anchor-view features synthesizes temporally coherent wrist-view videos that respect the recovered geometry and scene semantics. We validate WristWorld on Droid (Khazatsky et al., 2024), Calvin (Mees et al., 2022), and Franka Panda setups. Results show state-of-the-art wrist-view video generation with superior spatial consistency, and practical downstream gains for VLA: on Calvin we increase average task completion length by 3.81% and close 42.4% of the anchorwrist performance gap. Importantly, WristWorld can be used as plug-in to extend existing single-view world models with multi-view capability without requiring new wrist-view data collection. Our contributions are three-fold: novel two-stage framework for anchor-view to wrist-view video generation that achieves both temporal Consistency and geometric consistency. Leveraging wrist head, SPC loss, and CLIP-encoded anchor-view features to synthesize consistent wrist-view sequences from anchor views. Experiments showing that our approach improves VLA performance and can be applied in plugand-play manner to extend single-view world models into multi-view settings."

            "content": "3D Reconstruction for Robotic Perception. Accurate multi-view 3D reconstruction and camera pose are key for manipulation, yet many frameworks assume fixed calibration or static views. Recent work injects geometry into policies; e.g., GNFactor jointly optimizes NeRF scene model and manipulation policy, sharing one 3D representation for multi-task learning (Ze et al., 2023). Transformer-based vision models have also been explored; for instance, VGGT encodes multi-view 2 observations into fused geometric features for 3D prediction (Wang et al., 2025b). Still, moving wrist-camera pose is rarely modeled, and large datasets rely on manual calibration instead of online wrist-centric pose prediction. Cross-view consistency remains crucial in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (Wang et al., 2025d; Hu et al., 2025), with MTVCrafter introducing 4D motion tokens to enforce coherence (Ding et al., 2025). Video Generation Models for Manipulation. Diffusion-based video generators let planners imagine robot futures. Web-scale text-to-video models look realistic but struggle with novel objectaction combinations. RoboDreamer improves compositionality by factorizing generation via language parsing (Zhou et al., 2024). This&That adds gesture conditioning for controllable plans beyond text-only inputs (Wang et al., 2025a). Coupling prediction with control, VideoAgent iteratively self-refines diffused plans to reduce hallucinations (Soni et al., 2025), and action-conditioned diffusion in generative predictive control approximates dynamics for policy improvement (Qi et al., 2025). Synthetic data routes like DreamGen synthesize diverse dream trajectories for stronger generalization (Jang et al., 2025). For spatial consistency, EnerVerse combines multi-view diffusion with 4D reconstruction (Gaussian splatting) to produce geometry-consistent futures and better long-horizon planning (Huang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). Large frameworks such as UniPi use text-guided video generation to learn universal multi-task policies (Du et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2025a). VisionLanguageAction (VLA) Robotics Models. VLA policies learn directly from paired visual and linguistic inputs without constructing an explicit world model. GR-1, GPT-style videoconditioned policy, is pretrained on large human video corpora and fine-tuned to achieve state-ofthe-art multi-task performance on CALVIN (88.9% to 94.9%) with zero-shot generalization to novel scenes (Wu et al., 2023; Mees et al., 2022). GR-2 scales training to 38M videotext pairs, producing generalist agent capable of executing 100+ manipulation tasks by grounding instructions in action sequences (Cheang et al., 2024). Beyond internet video pretraining, Vid2Robot maps human video demonstrations to robot policies via cross-attention (Jain et al., 2024), and MimicPlay derives hierarchical plans from unstructured human play (Wang et al., 2023). Label-free alignment has also been explored by grounding frozen video generator into continuous actions through goal-conditioned self-exploration (Luo & Du, 2024). Conversely, human-in-the-loop fine-tuning attains high dexterity yet forgoes an explicit visual world model (Luo et al., 2025; Chi et al., 2025b)."

            "title": "3 METHOD",
            "content": "Our method is two-stage 4D Generative World Model designed to synthesize geometrically consistent wrist-view videos from third-person observations. The first reconstruction stage estimates wrist poses and generates condition maps via point cloud projection. The second generation stage synthesizes temporally coherent wrist-view sequences conditioned on these maps and enriched by semantic guidance. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2. 3.1 PRELIMINARY Video Diffusion Models. Recent advances in video synthesis are largely driven by diffusionbased generative models. video = {xt}T t=1 is first compressed into latent representation t=1 RT CHW using video VAE, which reduces spatial and temporal resolution Z0 = {zt}T while preserving content semantics. The diffusion framework then defines forward noising process that gradually perturbs Z0 into Gaussian noise, and learned denoising model œµŒ∏ that reverses this process. At training time, the objective is to predict the added noise given the noisy latent ZœÑ at step œÑ and the conditioning signal S: Ldiff = EZ0, œµ, œÑ œµ œµŒ∏(ZœÑ , œÑ c)2 2 , where œµ (0, I) and ZœÑ is obtained by variance-scheduled corruption of Z0. In Diffusion Transformer (DiT), conditioning is typically realized as text embeddings, which are projected into conditioning tokens and injected into the transformer blocks, thereby guiding the denoising process. Visual Geometry Models. To capture multi-view geometry and establish dense cross-view correspondences, we build on VGGT (Wang et al., 2025b), large Transformer that encodes multicamera observations into fused features and predicts 3D quantities such as point clouds and correspondences. Given query point uj in image Iq, the matching head predicts corresponding points Figure 2: Overview of our method. We introduce two-stage 4D Generative World Model. In the reconstruction stage, VGGT Wang et al. (2025b) is extended with wrist head to regress wrist pose, guided by Spatial Projection Consistency Loss that supervises directly from RGB without depth or extrinsics. The predicted pose projects point clouds into the wrist view. In the generation stage, these projections, combined with external-view CLIP embeddings, condition video generator to synthesize wrist-view sequences. Without first-frame guidance, the model produces additional wrist views for VLA datasets, yielding substantial performance gains. }N {ÀÜuj query points. The resulting correspondences are i=1 in other views {Ii}, where is the number of anchor views and the number of sampled = {(uj q, ÀÜuj )}j=1,...,M i=1,...,N , providing dense pixel-level matching across anchor and wrist views. We adopt the pinhole camera model, where 3D point ÀÜy R3 projects to pixel R2 via camera intrinsics K, extrinsics (R, T), and projection function Œ†(): = Œ†(K, R, T, ÀÜy). 3.2 RECONSTRUCTION STAGE Wrist Head Design. To estimate the wrist-mounted viewpoint, we extend VGGT with specialized wrist head. Based on the aggregated multi-view features F, we introduce set of learnable wrist queries that attend to these tokens through Transformer decoder. The wrist head regresses the wrist camera extrinsics, denoted as rotation Rw SO(3) and translation Tw R3: (Rw, Tw) = WristHead(F, qw), where qw are the wrist queries. This design allows the model to capture hand-centered motion and implicit camera pose even when wrist-view data is unavailable. Spatial Projection Consistency Loss. Direct supervision of wrist extrinsics or depth maps is often missing. To address this, we propose Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) loss that enforces 4 geometric consistency from RGB correspondences alone. As shown in Figure 3, given dense 2D 2D correspondences = {(uj j=1 between an anchor view Iq and the wrist view Iw, and reconstructed point cloud = {ÀÜyk} from anchor views, we associate each anchor pixel uj with its corresponding 3D point ÀÜyj Y. This yields set of 3D2D pairs w)}M q, ÀÜuj = {(ÀÜyj, ÀÜuj w)}M j=1, linking reconstructed world points to wrist-view pixels. For each pair (ÀÜyj, ÀÜuj by uj positive depth values and Sback for negative ones. The SPC loss consists of two terms: w), the projection of ÀÜyj under the predicted wrist pose (Rw, Tw) is denoted = Œ†(K, Rw, Tw, ÀÜyj), where is fixed by the dataset. We then divide points into Sfront for Lu = 1 Sfront (cid:88) ÀÜyj Sfront MSE(uj w, ÀÜuj w), Ldepth = 1 Sback (cid:88) zj. ÀÜyj Sback where zj is the depth value of point ÀÜyj in the wrist camera coordinate frame. Finally, the projection loss is defined as Lproj = ŒªuLu + ŒªdepthLdepth, where Œªu and Œªdepth control the balance between reprojection consistency and depth feasibility. Condition Map Generation. With the estimated wrist poses across frames, reconstructed 3D scenes are projected into the wrist-view image plane to form temporally aligned sequence of condition maps. These maps provide frameconsistent structural guidance for the subsequent video generation stage. 3.3 GENERATION STAGE Video Generation Model. We adopt DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2022) for video synthesis and introduce two targeted modifications. First, the conditioning comprises third-person CLIP features together with text embeddings to modulate the DiT. Second, we modify the patch embedding to ingest the concatenated latent stream t=1 RT 2CHW , exZ0 = {[ zt panding the standard input from (T, C, H, ) to (T, 2C, H, ). w; zt ]}T Spatial Projection Consistency Figure 3: (SPC) loss. We first establish anchorwrist 2D point matching and then lift the matched pixels to 2D3D correspondences using the reconstructed point cloud. The 3D points are subsequently projected into the wrist view with the predicted wrist pose, after which the SPC loss is computed to enforce geometric consistency. Wrist-View-Projection-Guided Generation. Since the projected condition maps are geometrically aligned with the wrist viewpoint, they directly provide spatial structure. We encode each wrist view projection Ct into latent representation zt using VAE, and concatenate it with the noisy wrist latent zt w: zt = [ zt ; zt ], which is then processed by the video generation model. This integration allows the model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view sequences that remain consistent with 3D geometry. CLIP-Encoded Anchor-View Semantics. Because condition maps may miss global semantics (e.g., small or blurred objects from point-cloud projection), we introduce an external semantic pathway. Each third-person frame from anchor views is encoded by CLIP image encoder to obtain per-frame, per-view features: Eclip = (cid:8) et,i (cid:9) i=1,...,N ; t=1,...,T R(N )dc, where et,i denotes the CLIP embedding of the t-th frame from the i-th external view. text prompt is also encoded, and both modalities are projected into shared conditioning space: Eclip = Wc Eclip, Etext = Wt Etext. 5 Figure 4: Visualization of our generation result. As illustrated in the figure, we compare our generated condition maps against the 3D Base (VGGT without the SPC Loss), where our approach demonstrates superior viewpoint consistency. Furthermore, in comparison to the WoW 14B (Chi et al., 2025c) baseline which based on Wan 14B (Wan et al., 2025), our method achieves both higher generation quality and improved viewpoint alignment accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework and underscore its potential to serve as training data for downstream VLA models.

Calvin (Mees et al., 2022). To benchmark vision-language-action learning in simulation, we adopt the Calvin environment. Calvin provides multi-view demonstrations across multiple task splits; in this work we focus on the split and use 10% of the data for training. For downstream VLA models, we follow the standard Task configuration for training and evaluation. 3. Franka Panda. Beyond simulation, we collect 1700 demonstrations on real Franka Panda manipulator. Our setup includes three static cameras (left, right, top) and one wrist-view camera. Videos are captured at 30 fps and downsampled temporally by factor of three. For evaluation, we hold out 100 videos from this collection. Training. Our framework is trained in two stages: reconstruction and video generation. During pretraining on the Droid dataset, the reconstruction stage is optimized on 8A800 GPUs for 12 hours with batch size of 4 and resolution of 640480, followed by the video generation stage on 8A800 GPUs for 24 hours using condition token length of 512. Building upon this, we perform cross-view fine-tuning with the Franka demonstrations. The reconstruction stage fine-tuning requires 8 GPUs for 6 hours, while the generation stage is trained on 8 GPUs for 12 hours under the same batch size, resolution, and token length settings. Model. Our framework consists of two stages: reconstruction and generation. In the reconstruction stage, VGGT backbone encodes multi-view features, and dedicated wrist head predicts wrist camera parameters through attention-based token fusion and transformer refinement, supervised by projection and optional L1 losses. In the generation stage, We use the VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013) compresses frames into latent sequences, while the DiT applies spatio-temporal attention on tokenized latents. Conditioned jointly on text and visual features, the DiT generates geometrically consistent and temporally coherent videos. 4.2 VIDEO GENERATION QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION We compare against recent baselines on Droid and Franka-Panda (Tab. 1). Our method surpasses prior work across all metrics (FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2019), LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018), SSIM (Wang et al., 2004), PSNR) without first-frame guidance, achieving large FVD gains (temporal coherence) and improved perceptual and structural fidelity. Even on the challenging Franka-Panda dataset with viewpoint variation, our framework consistently outperforms all baselines. Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6. In Fig. 4, our wrist view projection yield more viewpoint-aligned generations than both the 3D Base and WoW 14B. On Calvin  (Fig. 5)  , our approach improves spatial/viewpoint consistency over SVD. On Franka Panda data  (Fig. 6)  , our wrist-view generations closely match ground truth, showing strong third-to-wrist generalization. 7 Wrist view Projection Ext view clip embedding SPC Loss FVD LPIPS SSIM PSNR 3091.74 790.10 474.32 421.10 0.74 0.59 0.44 0.39 0.55 0.47 0. 0.64 10.42 10.75 13.67 14.78 Table 4: Ablation on wrist view projection, clip embeddings, and SPC loss. Figure 5: Visualization on the Calvin (Mees et al., 2022) benchmark. We compare our generated wrist-view videos (bottom row) with the ground truth (second row) and baseline method (third row, Stable Video Diffusion (Blattmann et al., 2023)). Our approach achieves better spatial and viewpoint consistency than the baseline, while also producing more faithful wrist-view frames. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method in bridging anchor-view and wrist-view perspectives. Together, these qualitative and quantitative results highlight that our generated videos not only serve as high-quality reconstructions but also provide valuable data for downstream VLA models. 4.3 DATA-DRIVEN VLA ENHANCEMENT We evaluate whether synthesized wrist-view videos improve visionlanguageaction (VLA) policies. Our framework generates wrist-view sequences from anchor-view rollouts and augments the training data of an unchanged VLA model (Video Prediction Policy, VPP (Hu et al., 2024)), without adding demonstrations, losses, or architectural changes. On Calvin, this augmentation increases average task completion length by 3.81%, narrows the anchorwrist gap by 42.4%, and improves full five-task completion by 5%. These results show that wrist-view generation provides effective supervisory signals and yields measurable VLA gains without extra data collection. Similarly, on Franka-Panda demonstrations (Tab. 3), generated wrist views consistently improve task performance, confirming that the synthetic data is realistic and beneficial. Overall, wrist-view generation enriches robot datasets and yields measurable VLA gains. 4.4 PLUG-AND-PLAY EXTENSION TO SINGLE-VIEW WORLD MODELS Our framework serves as plug-and-play add-on to an existing single-view world model (SVWM) while leaving the SVWM unchanged. In the baseline, the SVWM takes an anchor-view first frame and predicts an anchor-view rollout; with our module, that rollout is then converted into temporally 8 Figure 6: Visualization on Franka real-robot data. Multiple input anchor views (left) are used to generate wrist-view sequences (top right), which are compared with ground-truth wrist observations (bottom right).

This plug-and-play design improves spatial consistency and perceptual quality across different baselines, while still delivering high-quality results with fewer anchor views. aligned wrist-view video without wrist first frame required. This post-hoc wrist synthesis resolves the core hurdle for multi-view extension, namely cross-view consistency without wrist initialization, while enriching the observation space without additional data. As shown in Tab. 5, integrating our module with WoW (Chi et al., 2025c) improves spatial and perceptual fidelity, and the gains persis 4.5 ABLATION STUDY We conduct an ablation study to disentangle the contribution of different components, as summarized in Tab. 4. The results show that the wrist view projection plays the most critical role: removing it leads to drastic drop in video quality, as reflected by large increase in FVD and degraded perceptual metrics. Moreover, the SPC loss proves essential for ensuring that the condition map carries accurate guidance information; without it, the model struggles to align wrist-view synthesis with external observations. The combination of condition map, external-view embeddings, and tracking loss yields the best performance across all metrics. Although experiments without projection embeddings are still in progress, we estimate that their performance will be similarly poor, further reinforcing the necessity of projection-based conditioning for coherent multi-view generation."

            "content": "In this work, we introduced WristWorld, two-stage 4D framework for synthesizing geometrically and temporally consistent wrist-view videos from anchor-view inputs. In the reconstruction stage, 9 wrist head and SPC loss augment geometric transformer to estimate poses and generate condition maps without explicit wrist supervision. These maps are then fused with CLIP semantics and text guidance in diffusion transformer, producing high-fidelity wrist-view sequences aligned with geometry and task semantics. Experiments on Calvin, Droid, and Franka Panda validate our framework: WristWorld achieves strong video generation across metrics and visual quality, while the synthesized wrist-view videos significantly boost downstream VLA learning. By augmenting datasets with wrist-centric views, WristWorld bridges the exocentricegocentric gap and provides scalable, data-driven solution for robotic training."

            "content": "A.1 DATASETS Calvin. The Calvin benchmark (Mees et al., 2022) (Composing Actions from Language and Vision) is simulated environment designed for studying long-horizon, language-conditioned robotic manipulation. It defines set of five core manipulation tasksopening and closing drawers, switching lights, placing objects in containers, pushing blocks, and rotating knobswhich can be composed into multi-step instructions. Each demonstration is collected via teleoperation in simulation and includes synchronized RGB observations from multiple static cameras, robot states, low-level actions, and the corresponding language command. The benchmark further provides different environment variations, enabling controlled evaluations of generalization to new objects, layouts, and task compositions. CALVIN thus serves as standardized testbed to validate whether synthesized wrist-view videos can enhance task-conditioned learning in controlled simulation setting. Droid. The Droid dataset (Khazatsky et al., 2024) (Distributed Robot Interaction Dataset) is one of the largest collections of real-world robotic demonstrations. It contains approximately 76k trajectories spanning 350 hours, collected across 564 unique scenes and 86 manipulation tasks by over 50 contributors from multiple institutions. To ensure consistency, each robot setup follows unified configuration: Franka Panda 7-DoF manipulator, two ZED 2 stereo cameras for external anchor views, and ZED Mini wrist-mounted camera for egocentric observations, along with standardized calibration. Each trajectory records synchronized multi-view RGB-D streams, camera intrinsics and extrinsics, joint states, and control commands. The scale and diversity of DROID make it challenging but rich source of anchor-view data, while the presence of dedicated wrist camera offers an opportunity to validate generated views against ground-truth egocentric observations. Franka Panda demonstrations. To further evaluate our method on controlled real-robot setup, we collected dataset of 1.7 demonstrations using Franka Panda manipulator. The hardware setup mirrors that of DROID, with multiple fixed anchor cameras and wrist-mounted camera, but data collection was conducted entirely in-house. Demonstrations span diverse manipulation skills such as grasping, transporting, and placing objects under natural occlusions from the robot arm. For each sequence, we log synchronized anchor-view and wrist-view videos, as well as proprioceptive states and control commands. While smaller in scale than DROID, this dataset captures calibration imperfections and actuation variability, making it particularly valuable for fine-tuning and validating wrist-view generation under true physical dynamics. A.2 TRAINING AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS This section provides the full setup for both stages of WristWorld in the 1.3B configuration, with emphasis on novel components and implementation details. We also include short explanations of key terms to aid readers unfamiliar with video generation or geometric reconstruction. Implementation Details. The wrist head is implemented as lightweight transformer decoder with 3 layers, 8 attention heads per layer, and an embedding dimension of 1024. It attends to aggregated multi-view tokens from VGGT and directly regresses wrist camera extrinsics (Rw, Tw). The Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) loss is computed using dense 2D2D correspondences. For each 3D point ÀÜyj, we project it into the wrist view as uj = Œ†(K, Rw, Tw, ÀÜyj), where is the dataset-provided intrinsics. We then split the projected points into Sfront = {ÀÜyj zj > 0} and Sback = {ÀÜyj zj < 0}, with zj denoting the depth value in the wrist frame. The loss is defined as Lu = 1 Sfront (cid:88) ÀÜyj Sfront and Lproj = ŒªuLu + ŒªdepthLdepth. MSE(uj w, ÀÜuj w), Ldepth = 1 Sback (cid:88) zj, ÀÜyj Sback For video generation, we use wrist-view projections as conditioning inputs. Each frame is encoded by VAE into latents zt and concatenated with the noisy wrist-view latents zt w. The patch embedding of the DiT is modified from standard 2 2 convolution, expanding input channels to 32 to accommodate concatenated latents. CLIP features from anchor views are projected from 512 dimensions into the DiT token space, while text embeddings from T5 are 4096-dimensional. Temporal and view embeddings are added to capture sequence alignment and camera identity. Reconstruction stage (VGGT + Wrist Head). We adopt VGGT-1B with point, depth, and camera heads (frozen) and train new wrist head. Training images are resized to 518518, and intrinsics are scaled accordingly. Two anchor views (ext1, ext2) are inputs, and the wrist pose is predicted relative to ext1. SPC loss enforces consistency: visible points are supervised with normalized reprojection error, while back-facing points are penalized if their predicted depth is negative.

A.3 VISUALIZATION To assess appearance fidelity and viewpoint stability under realistic manipulation, we run inference on Franka Panda platform for all compared video generation methods, including ours, using identical input trajectories and pre-processing. For each generated clip, we visualize the middle frame so as to emphasize long-horizon behavior and to minimize the bias introduced by the initial condition. The compared models comprise Pix2Pix (Isola et al., 2017), SVD (Blattmann et al., 2023), Wan 1.3B (Wan et al., 2025), Wan 14B, Cosmos-Predict2 (NVIDIA, 2025), and Ours. Following common practice for controllable synthesis, SVD, Wan 14B, and Cosmos-Predict2 are evaluated CFG balances diversity and fidelity in diffusion sampling by mixing conditional and unconditional generations. higher value yields sharper but less diverse outputs (Ho & Salimans, 2022). Figure 7: Qualitative visualization on Franka Panda. For each method, we generate videos and visualize the middle frame of each sequence to probe long-horizon stability. Rows denote methods (the top row shows ground-truth wrist-camera frames), and columns denote different manipulation scenes from the Franka Panda setup. Our approach maintains superior geometric consistency (crisp boundaries, coherent occlusions, stable perspective/scale) and wrist-following behavior (viewpoint motion aligned with end-effector motion and consistent object-relative poses) compared with prior models. with first-frame guidance, while the remaining methods use their public default settings. Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 7. Across diverse scenes, our method exhibits the strongest geometric consistency and wristfollowing capability. By geometric consistency we refer to coherent object shapes and boundaries, stable perspective and scale, and physically plausible occlusions (e.g., handobject and objecttable contacts). By wrist-following we mean that the synthesized wrist-camera view remains aligned with the end-effector motion, yielding stable object-relative poses and camera parallax over time. In contrast, baselines frequently suffer from accumulated drift in the middle of the sequence: textures smear or dissolve, straight edges warp, object scale fluctuates, and the rendered viewpoint decouples from the manipulator pose, producing noticeable misalignment between the camera motion and the underlying action. Methods that rely on first-frame guidance preserve appearance early on but tend to exhibit background and pose drift as the sequence proceeds; methods without guidance avoid overfitting to the first frame but often display ghosting and fine-detail loss under fast motions or partial occlusions. While our approach may still blur very small, fast-moving details in rare cases, its overall spatial coherence and cameramotion coupling are substantially more reliable, which agrees with the improvements observed in video quantitative metrics. A.4 FRANKA PANDA SETTING As shown in Figure. 8, we employ Franka Emika Panda manipulator in our experimental setup, augmented with multiple Intel RealSense cameras to provide diverse visual perspectives. Specifically, wrist-mounted camera enables close-up views of the manipulation workspace, while topmounted camera captures overhead information. In addition, left and right side cameras provide complementary viewpoints for robust perception. This multi-view sensing arrangement facilitates both accurate 3D reconstruction and reliable visual feedback for manipulation tasks. Figure 8: Experimental setup with the Franka Panda manipulator. The system is equipped with multiple Intel RealSense cameras: wrist-mounted, top, left, and right. This configuration enables multi-view visual input for robust perception and manipulation."
