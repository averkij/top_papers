            "content": "However, this approach faces significant challenge: reasoning chains distilled from LRMs often contain numerous functional elements that, while reflecting human problem-solving processes, possibly produce unnecessarily verbose outputs [7, 32, 4]. In typical mathematical scenario, an LRM might solve problem by establishing an initial solution path, verifying calculations, identifying Corresponding authors. Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: Our PIR framework (implemented as LIMO-P) optimizes the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff in LLM reasoning across AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks: it consistently enhances accuracy while concurrently reducing response tokens, thus improving computational efficiency, demonstrating that selectively pruning low-importance functional steps produces more concise, faster, and more accurate reasoning chains. errors, revising the approach, and ultimately confirming the final answer. This thorough process generates lengthy reasoning chains with redundant or marginally valuable steps. When these verbose chains are used to fine-tune target models, the resulting models inevitably adopt similar behaviors, producing equally elaborate reasoning sequences despite many steps contributing minimally to solution accuracy. Consequently, inference time increases substantially, along with computational demands and response latency. This inefficiency poses considerable obstacle to implementing reasoning-enhanced LLMs in practical applications where timely, precise responses are essential. To address this challenge, we introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), novel framework that systematically refines reasoning chains to optimize the efficiency-effectiveness balance. Our refinement approach builds upon three key innovations that work in concert: (1) We develop systematic methodology to classify functional patterns in complex reasoning chains, identifying four distinct modesprogressive reasoning and three types of functional steps: verification, multimethod validation, and error correction. (2) Through comprehensive analysis across diverse problem domains, our analysis indicates that progressive reasoning forms the essential logical backbone, directly advancing solution derivation, and must be preserved intact. In contrast, functional steps frequently introduce computational overhead with redundancies that can be strategically pruned without compromising solution integrity. This differential treatmentpreserving progressive reasoning while selectively optimizing functional elementsmaintains the core problem-solving logic while significantly improving computational efficiency. (3) Building on (1) and (2), we propose the PIR metric, which quantitatively measures each functional steps contribution to the final solution by comparing answer perplexity with and without specific steps. This perplexity-based evaluation provides principled mechanism to refine reasoning chains by identifying and selectively removing low-importance functional steps while preserving the progressive reasoning chain. By selectively targeting only non-essential functional components, our refinement approach maintains the logical coherence of the solution process while significantly reducing verbosity. 2 By applying our refinement framework to datasets distilled from different foundation models (LIMO [37] from Deepseek-R1, S1 [20] from Gemini Flash Thinking [2], and LIMO-V2 [37] from QwQ), we create PIR-optimized training datasets. Models fine-tuned on these refined datasets maintain or enhance accuracy while significantly reducing response length compared to models trained on the original unrefined data. Our experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PIR-refined models consistently outperform their counterparts in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to 71% efficiency improvement. The contributions of our work include: 1. novel perplexity-based refinement framework (PIR) for quantifying the importance of reasoning steps and optimizing reasoning chains, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. 2. systematic analysis of reasoning patterns in reasoning problem-solving, providing insights into the structure and function of different reasoning elements. 3. Comprehensive empirical validation showing that PIR-refined models achieve improved accuracy (+0.9% to +6.6%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3% to -41%) across diverse benchmarks. 4. Demonstration of the frameworks generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets. Our work addresses critical gap in current approaches to LLM reasoning enhancement, offering practical solution for more efficient reasoning without sacrificing solution quality. By systematically refining training data to preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant functional steps (verification, validation, and error correction processes), we enable LLMs to produce concise yet equally effective reasoning chains, advancing the practical deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs across scenarios where response time and computational resources are valuable constraints."

            "content": "Reasoning chains produced by LRMs typically contain numerous functional stepsincluding verification processes, multiple solution approaches, and error correctionsthat mirror human problemsolving but significantly increase computational overhead without proportionally enhancing solution accuracy. This section presents our Perplexity-based Importance Refinement (PIR) framework, which quantitatively evaluates reasoning step importance and systematically refines reasoning chains by preserving essential solution elements while removing less valuable components. 2.1 Problem Formulation In this paper, we address the challenge of optimizing reasoning chains for complex reasoning tasks. Formally, we consider dataset containing question-reasoning-answer triplets (q, r, a), where represents reasoning problem, is the reasoning chain, and is the answer. We define reasoning chain as sequence of intermediate steps {s1, s2, ..., sn}, where each step si represents logical deduction that bridges the gap between the question and the final answer. Our goal is to refine each reasoning chain into an optimized version such that: (1) The answer accuracy is preserved: (q, r) = (q, r) = a; (2) The token length is reduced: < r; (3) The essential reasoning logic is maintained without harming the quality of the dataset. 2.2 Theoretical Foundations Cognitive Reasoning Patterns Through extensive analysis of reasoning patterns, we identify four representative distinct modes [9, 8] that characterize problem-solving processes: (1) Progressive Reasoning, characterized by forward-chaining inference that follows deductive logical progression from premises to conclusion, forming the essential backbone of solution development; (2) Verification, which represents metacognitive monitoring processes where previous calculations are systematically validated for accuracy, often using phrases like Let me check; (3) Multi-method Validation, demonstrating convergent thinking by applying diverse methodological approaches to reinforce conclusions, potentially introducing redundancy; and (4) Error Correction embodies self-regulatory mechanism through which logical inconsistencies, computational errors, or potential mistakes are identified and remediated. This pattern captures the process of recognizing when path of reasoning may be flawed, reassessing assumptions, and correcting course. While progressive reasoning constitutes the critical path to solution derivation, the other three functional patterns, though valuable in human-like reasoning, often contain redundancies that can be optimized without Figure 2: PIR framework pipeline for reasoning optimization: raw reasoning is segmented into logical steps, step is classified into reasoning patterns, PIR value is calculated to quantify step importance, and low-value functional steps are filtered while preserving progressive reasoning, resulting in more efficient reasoning chains. compromising solution integrity. Details about the four reasoning patterns and corresponding cases can be found in Appendix A. PIR: Perplexity-Based Importance Refinement of Reasoning Steps PIR quantifies reasoning step importance by measuring perplexity changes when specific steps are removed. The indicator compares answer perplexity with and without particular reasoning step: PIRθ(xix1:n) = log (cid:18) PPLθ(R {xi}) PPLθ(R) (cid:19) (1) Where PPLθ(R) and PPLθ(R {xi}) represent perplexities calculated by model θ with and without step i: PPLθ(R) = exp PPLθ(R {xi}) = exp 1 1 (cid:88) j= (cid:88) j=1 log pθ(ajx1:n, a<j) log pθ(ajx1:i1, xi+1:n, a<j) (2) (3) Here, represents the number of answer tokens, aj is the j-th answer token, x1:n represents all reasoning steps, and x1:i1, xi+1:n represents all steps except step i. The perplexity calculations are performed using model θ. higher PIR value indicates greater step importance: when critical reasoning step is eliminated, the model becomes significantly less confident in generating the correct answer, lacking essential information for solution derivation, resulting in higher perplexity and thus higher PIR score. 2.3 Analysis and Optimization of Reasoning Chains Our approach first employs hierarchical decomposition process where reasoning chains are segmented into logical steps by Claude 3.7 Sonnet [1], with each step typically comprising multiple coherent sentences that form cohesive reasoning unit. For classification, we implement two-phase system: initially, rule-based pattern matching component identifies steps containing characteristic linguistic markers (such as Let me check for verification or made mistake for error correction). For steps lacking explicit markers, we again apply Claude 3.7 Sonnet to perform contextual analysis, capturing more nuanced reasoning structures and assigning appropriate pattern classifications. 4 Table 1: Dataset Statistics. For each dataset, we report the data source, number of samples, total token count, and the distribution of tokens across four distinct reasoning patterns. Dataset Source Samples Tokens Progressive Reasoning Verification Multi-method Validation Error Correction S1K LIMO LIMO-V Gemini DeepSeek-R1 QwQ 1,000 817 800 4,509,505 5,144,004 8,866,950 71.4% 59.7% 64.3% 9.2% 11.8% 9.8% 13.9% 10.9% 12.7% 5.5% 17.6% 13.2% To validate our classification methodology, we randomly select 5% of classified steps across our datasets for human evaluation. Four postgraduates independently assess whether each step is correctly classified according to our defined patterns. Steps are considered correctly classified only when all four annotators unanimously agree with the systems classification. This rigorous evaluation protocol revealed that 93.4% of the steps are unanimously verified as correctly classified, demonstrating the robust performance of our hybrid classification approach for reasoning step categorization. Building on this classification system and the PIR metric, we implemented targeted pruning approach that selectively identifies and removes low-importance functional steps while maintaining data quality and preserving reasoning integrity. This process is shown in Figure 2. Unlike approaches that might indiscriminately compress reasoning chains, our method specifically targets functional steps (verification, multi-method validation, and error correction) while preserving all progressive reasoning steps, which constitute the essential deductive core of the solution process. For each identified functional step, we compute its PIR value to quantify its importance based on the impact its removal has on answer prediction confidence. The process then selectively removes functional steps with the lowest PIR values according to predefined ratio threshold, resulting in more concise reasoning chains that maintain effectiveness while significantly reducing verbosity. This selective pruning approach creates more efficient reasoning chains that maintain the integrity of core problem-solving logic while eliminating redundant verification processes. The resulting optimized chains are both more efficient to process and more effective as training exemplars for downstream models, without sacrificing the quality and completeness of the essential reasoning. The Algorithm 1 in the appendix demonstrates this whole process. In our experiments, we apply Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to calculate PPL."

            "content": "3.1 Experimental Setup Training Dataset To empirically validate our proposed PIR reasoning refinement framework, we conduct experiments using established datasets from prior work. As demonstrated in Table 1, our approach leverages three representative reasoning datasets: LIMO (distilled from DeepSeek R1), LIMO-V2 (distilled from QwQ), and S1K (distilled from Gemini Thinking). These datasets, distilled from different foundation models, represent diverse reasoning patterns and problem-solving approaches. Applying our framework across these varied sources allows us to validate the generalizability of our method across different data sources, ensuring that the PIR optimization is robust and not dependent on specific characteristics of any single source model. We apply our PIR framework to these datasets to create optimized versions: LIMO-P, LIMO-V2-P, and S1K-P. Additionally, we construct several variant datasets by implementing different refinement ratios to investigate the optimal balance between conciseness and effectiveness. Detailed information regarding different refinement ratios and the specific token counts of the optimized datasets is provided in the Appendix B.1. Benchmark Datasets To rigorously assess our methodology, we utilized three representivate reasoning-intensive benchmarks: (1) AIME24 evaluation set encompasses 30 challenging problems from the American Invitational Mathematics Examination administered in early 2024, requiring sophisticated reasoning across mathematical domains; (2) GPQA Diamond corpus incorporates 198 doctoral-level scientific inquiries across biological, chemical, and physical disciplines, presenting formidable challenges that even subject matter experts struggle to master fully; (3) AMC23 includs 40 problems from the AIMO progress prize competition.

We utilize Qwen2.5-Math evaluators [35] to systematically assess solution correctness across all solutions, with each sampling conducted at temperature setting of 0.7 to balance deterministic reasoning with exploration of solution paths. Building on our effectiveness measure, we quantify reasoning efficiency (EFF) as the ratio between model performance and resource utilization: EFF = ACC/TOK, where TOK represents the average number of response tokens across all benchmark problems. This efficiency metric captures the utility produced per unit of test-time resource consumption, effectively highlighting the critical trade-off between performance and computational cost. Evaluation of PIR Framework Across Multiple Training Datasets We establish baseline models (LIMO, LIMO-V2, and S1-32B) that were trained on the original unmodified datasets using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [35]. These baseline models were obtained from their official Hugging Face repositories.1 To test our PIR framework, we fine-tune the same Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct base model on the pruned datasets: LIMO-P, LIMO-V2-P, and S1K-P, using identical training scripts as described in the original papers and yielding our PIR-optimized models: LIMO-P, LIMO-V2-P, and S1-32B-P. All evaluations follow consistent testing protocols across methods to maintain comparative validity. Comparison Against Alternative Reasoning Optimization Methods We compare our PIR framework with other competitive reasoning optimization methods. First, we establish S1-32B as our primary baseline trained on the original unmodified S1K dataset without any reasoning optimization. We then compare against two leading competing methods from prior work: Prompt Reduction [6], denoted as S1-PROMPT, which develops innovative prompting strategies that encourage LLMs to use shortcuts to quickly exploit reasoning clues and bypass detailed procedural steps. We apply this method for model S1-32B as baseline; and SPIRIT [5], denoted as S1-SPIRIT, which applies non-discriminative pruning approach for all reasoning steps based solely on perplexity values. We apply this method to the S1K dataset to get pruned dataset, and fine-tuning Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct with the pruned dataset. Unlike our PIR method that selectively preserves essential progressive reasoning steps, S1-SPIRITs uniform filtering risks removing critical components necessary for accurate solutions. Additionally, we include an ablation of our method, Rule-based Filtering (denoted as S1-RULE), which identifies functional step categories but randomly removes steps from these categories without using PIR metrics to determine their importance.2 1https://huggingface.co/ 2We specifically chose S1K dataset for these comparisons because competing methods like SPIRIT require perplexity calculations for all sentences, which would be computationally prohibitive for the significantly larger LIMO or LIMO-V2 datasets, resulting in excessive computational costs and processing time. 6 Table 3: Experimental results comparing PIR(S1-32B-P) with different optimization approaches.

The PIR-optimized variants achieve superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across all model families. S1-32B-P shows remarkable improvements on AIME with 4.2 percentage point accuracy increase alongside 29% token reduction, yielding 56% efficiency improvement. Similarly, LIMO-P demonstrates consistent gains with enhanced accuracy (+6.6, +1.9, and +4.0 percentage points across AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond, respectively) while reducing token consumption by up to 15%, achieving efficiency improvements of 32%, 7%, and 9% across the three benchmarks. LIMO-V2-P exhibits comparable enhancements with token reductions of 12%, 7%, and 13%, paired with accuracy improvements of 4.9, 2.2, and 3.0 percentage points. These consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks confirm that our PIR framework effectively identifies and preserves high-value reasoning steps while eliminating low-importance functional components. Generalizability to Different Data Sources The substantial performance improvements across models trained on data distilled from diverse foundation models (S1 from Gemini Flash Thinking, LIMO from DeepSeek-R1, and LIMO-V2 from QwQ) suggest PIRs strong generalizability potential. While individual gains vary in magnitude, the consistent pattern of simultaneous accuracy increases and token reductions across these different data sources indicates that our framework successfully identifies important reasoning patterns independent of the original distillation source. This suggests that PIR captures fundamental aspects of reasoning quality rather than exploiting source-specific characteristics. Comparison with Alternative Optimization Methods Table 3 demonstrates our PIR frameworks superior performance compared to other reasoning optimization approaches. PIR (S1-32B-P) consistently outperforms all alternatives across benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over the baseline S1-32B model with accuracy gains of 4.2, 2.2, and 0.9 percentage points alongside token reductions of 29%, 16%, and 41% on AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond respectively. Notably, our approach of selectively pruning only functional steps while preserving all progressive reasoning components proves superior to whole-sentence pruning methods (S1-SPIRIT), which apply filtering indiscriminately across all reasoning steps. The superior accuracy of S1-32B-P over S1-SPIRIT, particularly on AIME (5.0 percentage point advantage), empirically validates our hypothesis that progressive reasoning steps constitute the essential solution backbone and should remain intact. 3.3 Analysis 3.3.1 Generalizability to Test-Time Scaling Test-time scaling represents critical dimension of LLM reasoning deployment, where more computational resources are allocated during inference. To evaluate whether our PIR optimization framework maintains its effectiveness across varying inference-time token budgets, we conducted experiments measuring accuracy as function of token budget constraints. Figure 1 presents the test-time scaling curves across three benchmarks of LIMO and LIMO-P. The results demonstrate that PIR-optimized models consistently outperform their non-optimized counterparts across most token budget levels. The superior performance of PIR-optimized models across different token budgets demonstrates the generalizability of our approach to different resource constraints. This makes our PIR framework particularly valuable for real-world applications where inference efficiency and response latency are crucial considerations. The ability to maintain performance advantages highlights the robustness of our optimization methodology to different deployment scenarios. 7 Figure 3: Impact of pruning ratio on model performance. This figure displays relative performance metrics (normalized to baseline) across different pruning ratios for AIME and AMC benchmarks. The horizontal dashed line represents the baseline performance (ratio=0). Figure 4: Impact of PIR refinement across model sizes and benchmarks. Heatmaps show relative percentage changes between models trained with pruned versus original datasets. Blue indicates improvement: higher accuracy, shorter response length, or better efficiency. 3.3.2 Impact of ratios We investigated the impact of various pruning ratios on model performance by creating multiple LIMO dataset variants with different proportions of functional reasoning steps removed. As shown in Figure 3, our experiments revealed clear performance trade-offs across metrics. For the AIME benchmark, lower pruning ratios (0.2-0.3) yielded optimal accuracy improvements over the baseline, while higher ratios (0.8) achieved the greatest response length reduction. For AMC, moderate pruning ratio of 0.3 delivered peak accuracy while maintaining efficiency gains. Test time efficiency consistently improved with pruning across both benchmarks, with particularly strong gains on AIME. These results demonstrate the existence of an optimal refinement threshold that balances the removal of redundant functional steps with the preservation of critical reasoning components. Excessive pruning beyond this threshold leads to declining accuracy as valuable reasoning elements are removed, even when categorized as functional steps. This pattern validates our PIR frameworks approach of selectively identifying and preserving high-value reasoning steps based on their quantitative importance scores. 3.3.3 Generalizability to Model Size To evaluate PIRs generalizability across parameter scales, we conducted experiments using Qwen2.5 models ranging from 3B to 32B parameters, comparing the performance of models trained with optimized LIMO-P versus original LIMO datasets. As shown in Figure 4, our method demonstrates robust scalability with performance improvements across most model sizes. The benefits of PIR refinement become increasingly pronounced as model size increases, particularly for the AIME benchmark where the 32B model shows impressive gains across all metrics (11.8% accuracy improvement, 15.3% response length reduction, and 32.0% efficiency increase). For AMC, mid-sized models (7B-14B) yield the strongest efficiency improvements (up to 23.0%). The consistent pattern of enhancement for most model sizes suggests that our methods scalability and practical utility across various model sizes."

            "content": "4.1 Test-Time Scaling of LLMs Test-time scaling [12, 26, 29, 10] enhances LLM reasoning by increasing inference-time computation. Approaches include non-training methods, which optimize existing model inference strategies, and training-based methods, which modify model parameters. Non-training techniques encompass Best-of-N sampling [18, 27], majority voting [31, 3], and tree search [36, 30] for exploring multiple reasoning paths. Training-based approaches divide into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). SFT methods train on high-quality reasoning traces [20, 37, 16, 15], with S1 and LIMO demonstrating improved performance through careful sample selection. RL approaches [24, 10, 12, 29] have yielded exceptional results, with DeepSeek-R1 using GRPO and OpenAIs o1 and QwQ enabling autonomous development of reasoning chains that adaptively allocate computation based on problem complexity. Our work focuses on optimizing SFT-based approaches through perplexity-based refinement to improve efficiency while preserving accuracy. 4.2 Efficient Reasoning Research on efficient reasoning has gained significant traction as LLMs face challenges with computational overhead and verbosity. At inference time, various optimization approaches have emerged without requiring parameter updates. Length budgeting techniques like Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning [11] enforce token limits via prompting, while S1 [20] appends end-of-thinking delimiters. Dual-process inspired system switching methods alternate between fast intuitive and deliberative reasoning; Dualformer [28] selectively drops reasoning traces during training, while System 1.x [23] employs controller to assess task difficulty. Model switching approaches such as BiLD [14] and EAGLE [17] leverage speculative decoding with smaller models for initial predictions, while RouteLLM [21] routes queries based on complexity. For supervised fine-tuning, C3ot [13] preserves essential information while reducing redundancies, and TokenSkip [34] omits less important tokens. SPIRIT [5] prunes low-importance reasoning steps. RL-based methods either incorporate explicit length penalties [19, 25] or balance exploitation with exploration [22]. Most closely related to our work, SPIRIT [5] calculates perplexity for all reasoning steps and filters them based on predetermined ratio. Our approach fundamentally differs by distinguishing between reasoning step types rather than treating all equally. We preserve all progressive reasoning stepsthe essential solution backbonewhile only pruning less critical functional components (verification, multi-method validation, and error correction), ensuring core reasoning integrity and avoiding the risk of removing critical solution elements."

First, our evaluation primarily focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks and science tasks; future work should validate PIRs effectiveness across broader reasoning domains including logical, commonsense, and causal reasoning. Second, our refinement strategy relies on perplexity as the primary importance indicator, which may not fully capture the semantic contribution of certain reasoning steps. Alternative metrics incorporating semantic relevance could enhance refinement precision. Third, the optimal pruning ratio may vary across different reasoning tasks and model architectures, suggesting the need for adaptive refinement strategies. Finally, our approach currently requires access to model perplexity outputs, which may limit applicability with closedsource models. Addressing these limitations could further advance efficient reasoning frameworks for real-world applications."

Limo: Less is more for reasoning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.03387, 2025. 12 Reasoning Refinement: Reasoning Optimization Framework A.1 Phrases Used for Pattern Matching In our rule-based pattern matching system for reasoning step classification, we identify four distinct cognitive reasoning patterns characterized by specific linguistic markers. Table 4 presents these patterns alongside their characteristic phrases. Figure 5 demonstrates one sample from S1K containing the four patterns. Progressive Reasoning constitutes the critical path to solution derivation, characterized by forwardchaining inference that follows deductive logical progression from premises to conclusion. This pattern forms the essential backbone of solution development and is indicated by phrases that signal logical advancement, such as Lets solve, First/Then/Next, and Therefore. Verification represents metacognitive monitoring processes where previous calculations are systematically validated for accuracy. This pattern is identified through phrases like Let me check, Let me verify, and Double-check, which signal when the model reviews its prior work. Multi-method Validation demonstrates convergent thinking through the application of diverse methodological approaches to reinforce conclusions. This pattern is recognized through expressions indicating alternative approach consideration, including Alternatively, Another way, and Lets try different approach, potentially introducing redundancy. Error Correction embodies self-regulatory mechanism through which logical inconsistencies or computational errors are identified and remediated. This pattern is captured by phrases acknowledging mistakes, such as This is wrong, The mistake was, and This contradicts. Table 4: Cognitive Reasoning Patterns and Associated Phrases Cognitive Reasoning Patterns Phrases Progressive Reasoning Verification Multi-method Validation Error Correction Lets solve First/Then/Next Therefore We need to Given that Wait Let me check Let me verify Double-check Going back to Alternatively Another way Lets try different approach Using another method We can also verify This is wrong The mistake was Thats impossible This contradicts The error is A.2 Prompt used for Pattern Recognition Our hybrid classification system combines rule-based pattern matching with contextual analysis using Claude 3.7 Sonnet for more nuanced reasoning pattern recognition. In Figure 6 and 7, we present the prompts used for the sophisticated pattern recognition of Claude 3.7 Sonnet. 13 Figure 5: case where one training sample contains the four patterns. A.3 The Pseudocode of the Pipeline of PIR Algorithm 1 outlines the complete pipeline of our Perplexity-based Importance Refinement (PIR) framework. Our PIR framework implements streamlined three-phase process for optimizing reasoning chains. First, Claude 3.7 Sonnet performs hierarchical decomposition of reasoning into coherent steps, which are classified using our hybrid system combining rule-based pattern matching and contextual analysis. Second, we quantify each functional steps importance by calculating its PIR valuethe logarithmic ratio between the perplexity of generating the answer with and without that step using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Finally, we apply pattern-specific selective pruning, preserving all progressive reasoning while removing only low-value functional components (verification, multimethod validation, and error correction) based on their PIR scores, thereby maintaining solution integrity while significantly reducing verbosity. 14 Figure 6: The prompt to segment coherent sub-thinking sentences into cohesive reasoning steps."

            "content": "B.1 Dataset Statistics This section provides comprehensive statistics for the datasets used in our experiments before and after applying the PIR optimization framework at different thresholds. Table 5 presents the number of examples and total token counts for each dataset variant. The original datasets (S1, LIMO, and LIMO-V2) were derived from three different Large Reasoning Models: Gemini Flash Thinking, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ, respectively. Each dataset was then processed using our PIR framework at varying optimization ratios (from 0.2 to 0.8), where higher values indicate more aggressive pruning of functional reasoning steps. B.2 Main Results with Training Tokens Table 6 presents comprehensive evaluation of our PIR optimization approach across three challenging benchmarks: AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination), AMC (American Mathematics Competition), and GPQA Diamond. We include training token counts alongside accuracy, response length, and test-time efficiency to highlight the relationship between data efficiency and model performance. The baseline modelsR1-Distill-Qwen-32B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and QWQestablish performance references across the benchmarks. QWQ demonstrates superior accuracy but requires substantially longer responses, which impacts its test-time efficiency. Qwen2.532B-Instruct offers the highest efficiency due to its concise responses, albeit with lower accuracy. For our optimized models, we observe consistent patterns across all three dataset families (S1, LIMO, and LIMO-V2): S1 datasets: The PIR-optimized variant (S1-32B-P) achieves higher accuracy on AIME (+4.2%) and AMC (+2.2%) while using 4.4% fewer training tokens. The average response length decreases by 29% for AIME and 16% for AMC, resulting in efficiency improvements of 56% and 22%, respectively. LIMO datasets: The PIR-optimized model (LIMO-P) demonstrates accuracy improvements across all benchmarks (+6.6% on AIME, +1.9% on AMC, +4% on GPQA) while requiring 8.8% fewer training tokens. Response length reductions of 15% for AIME and 5% for AMC translate to efficiency gains of 32% and 7%, respectively. LIMO-V2 datasets: PIR optimization (LIMO-V2-P) achieves the consistent accuracy improvements (+4.9% on AIME, +2.2% on AMC, +3% on GPQA) while using 5.3% fewer training tokens. Response lengths decrease 15 Figure 7: The prompt to categorize the steps into reasoning patterns consistently (12% for AIME, 7% for AMC, 13% for GPQA), yielding efficiency improvements of 23%, 10%, and 22%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our PIR framework effectively reduces training token requirements while simultaneously improving both accuracy and efficiency across diverse reasoning tasks. The consistent performance improvements across different model families validate the generalizability of our approach. Notably, the LIMO-V2-P model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks while maintaining competitive efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of optimizing reasoning chains by preserving essential progressive reasoning while removing less valuable functional steps. B.3 Impact of Cognitive Reasoning Patterns Our empirical analysis of cognitive reasoning patterns reveals distinct performance characteristics across the evaluated benchmarks. As shown in Figure 8, the four identified reasoning patterns exhibit different trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. Progressive Reasoning (PR) provides solid baseline, while PR+Error Correction demonstrates the most balanced performance improvement on several datasets, delivering notable accuracy gains with competitive or even improved efficiency. These findings validate our PIR frameworks approach of quantitatively evaluating reasoning step importance to identify and selectively preserve high-value steps while pruning those with minimal contribution, creating optimized reasoning chains that balance accuracy gains with computational demands. The observed performance variations highlight that different reasoning patterns contribute differentially to model performance, with certain patterns delivering more substantial benefits in specific contexts. This suggests that selectively preserving the most valuable functional reasoning components while removing redundant steps can effectively optimize the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in reasoning chains. 16 Algorithm 1: Reasoning Chain Optimization via PIR Input: solution: original reasoning chain, answer: solution answer, ratio: pruning threshold, θ: evaluation model Output: solutionopt: optimized reasoning chain // Step 1: Segment and classify reasoning chain steps steps SegmentIntoLogicalSteps(solution, θ); classif ied_steps ClassifyReasoningPatterns(steps, θ); unctional_steps FilterByPatterns(classif ied_steps, {Verification, Multi-method, Error correction}); // Step 2: Calculate baseline perplexity with complete reasoning Lθ(R) CalculatePerplexity(solution, answer, θ); // Step 3: Evaluate importance of each functional step foreach stepi unctional_steps do solutioni RemoveStep(solution, stepi); Lθ(R {stepi}) CalculatePerplexity(solutioni, answer, θ); stepi.P IR log (cid:16) Lθ(R{stepi}) Lθ(R) (cid:17) ; end // Step 4: Selectively prune low-importance steps by pattern type solutionopt solution; foreach pattern {Verification, Multi-method, Error correction} do pattern_steps FilterByPattern(f unctional_steps, pattern); threshold CalculatePruningThreshold(pattern_steps, ratio); steps_to_prune SelectLowPIRSteps(pattern_steps, threshold); solutionopt RemoveSteps(solutionopt, steps_to_prune); end return solutionopt; Figure 8: Impact of reasoning patterns on model performance across different benchmarks. Each subplot displays the relative accuracy (y-axis) versus relative test time efficiency (x-axis) compared to the Progressive Reasoning (PR) baseline. PR represents the model trained with only progressive reasoning steps. PR+Verification (PR+V) is trained with the dataset that includes progressive reasoning and verification steps. PR+Error Correction (PR+EC) stands for the model trained with progressive reasoning and error correction steps. PR+Multi-method Validation (PR+MV) is trained with progressive reasoning and multi-method validation steps. B.4 Case Study To illustrate the effectiveness of our Perplexity-based Importance Refinement (PIR) framework, we present detailed case study examining how models trained on refined reasoning chains differ in their inference behavior. Figure 9 provides side-by-side comparison of responses generated by two models: one trained on the original LIMO dataset (left) and another trained on our PIRoptimized LIMO-P dataset (right), when presented with an identical mathematical problem. The model trained on original LIMO data exhibits characteristically verbose reasoning patterns inherited from its training data (left panel, 3,234 tokens). Despite reaching the correct answer, this model produces extensive verification steps, redundant calculations, and multiple self-checking procedures. The response includes numerous instances of recalculation, approach reassessment, and duplicate validationsreflecting the verbose nature of the LRM-distilled training data it was fine-tuned on. In striking contrast, the model trained on PIR-optimized data produces significantly more concise response while maintaining solution accuracy (right panel, 1,612 tokens). This model has learned to focus on essential progressive reasoning pathways while minimizing unnecessary verification steps. The 50% reduction in output token count demonstrates that models trained on PIR-refined data effectively internalize more efficient reasoning strategies without compromising problem-solving 17 Table 5: Statistics of Dataset Variants after PIR Optimization Source"

Qualitative analysis of both responses reveals that while the token count differs substantially, both models arrive at the correct solution (204 minutes). However, the PIR-trained model achieves this with greater efficiency, focusing on core mathematical operations and direct solution paths rather than extensive self-verification. This confirms that models inherit the reasoning patterns present in their training datawhen trained on strategically refined examples, they learn to generate more streamlined responses. This case study highlights critical advantage of our approach: by optimizing training data through selective removal of low-importance functional steps (based on our PIR metric), we influence downstream model behavior to favor efficiency without sacrificing effectiveness. The PIR-trained model demonstrates that the extensive verification processes prevalent in LRM reasoningwhile mimicking human problem-solvingcan be substantially reduced in practical applications without compromising solution quality. 18 Figure 9: Comparison of reasoning chains between model LIMO (left, 3,234 tokens) and PIRoptimized LIMO-P (right, 1,612 tokens) for the same mathematical problem. The model trained with PIR-optimized dataset maintains essential progressive reasoning while eliminating redundant verification steps, resulting in 50% reduction in token count without sacrificing solution accuracy."

            "title": "NeurIPS Paper Checklist",
            "content": "1. Claims Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the papers contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 1 Introduction Guidelines: The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Line 319-329 Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. The authors are encouraged to create separate \"Limitations\" section in their paper. The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on few datasets or with few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that arent acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. Theory assumptions and proofs Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] 20 Justification: 2.2 Theoretical Foundations Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced. All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide short proof sketch to provide intuition. Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 4. Experimental result reproducibility Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 3.1 Experimental Setup Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. If the paper includes experiments, No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. If the contribution is dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to hosted model (e.g., in the case of large language model), releasing of model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is new model (e.g., large language model), then there should either be way to access this model for reproducing the results or way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results. 5. Open access to data and code Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? 21 Answer: [Yes] Justification: Abstract Guidelines: The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so No is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for new open-source benchmark). The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. 6. Experimental setting/details Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 3.1 Experimental Setup Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material. 7. Experiment statistical significance Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our paper does not include error bars or traditional statistical significance tests, which is appropriate given the nature of our primary evaluation metric. We evaluate model performance using Pass@1 accuracy on reasoning benchmarks, which by definition is the expectation of the success rate across tasks. Since Pass@1 already represents an expected value, it inherently accounts for variability across problems, making additional statistical significance tests unnecessary in this context. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). 22 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to library function, bootstrap, etc.) The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report 2-sigma error bar than state that they have 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. 8. Experiments compute resources Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report these settings in the GitHub link. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didnt make it into the paper). 9. Code of ethics Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: we preserve anonymity. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require deviation from the Code of Ethics. The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction). 10. Broader impacts Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 1 Introduction Guidelines: The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. 23 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). 11. Safeguards Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: no risk. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. Released models that have high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make best faith effort. 12. Licenses for existing assets Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have cited the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include URL. The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. For scraped data from particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of dataset. For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. 24 If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the assets creators. 13. New assets Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 3.1 Experimental Setup Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 2.3 Analysis and Optimization of Reasoning Chains Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [Yes] Justification: 2.3 Analysis and Optimization of Reasoning Chains Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review. 16. Declaration of LLM usage 25 Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required. Answer: [Yes] Justification: 2.3 Analysis and Optimization of Reasoning Chains Guidelines: The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components. Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) for what should or should not be described."
