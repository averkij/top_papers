            "title": "1 INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Vector graphics, especially in the form of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), play an essential role in digital arts such as icons, clipart, and graphic design. By representing visual elements as geometric shapes, SVGs provide resolution independence, compact file sizes, and flexibility for layer-wise manipulation, making them highly favored by designers. Given the challenges of creating high-quality vector graphics, many recent works [Jain et al. 2022; Thamizharasan et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2023; Xing et al. 2024] have proposed algorithms in text-to-vector (T2V) generation. However, these methods overlook an important need in practical applications - style customization. Designers often customize set of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and aesthetic coherence. This is crucial for ensuring design quality, particularly in contexts like branding, user interfaces, and themed illustrations. Simply extending existing T2V methods for style customization is difficult. Current T2V methods can be categorized into 1 optimization-based and feed-forward methods. Optimization-based T2V methods, which either optimize set of vector elements (e.g., cubic Bézier curves) to fit the images generated by T2I models [Ma et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2023b], or directly optimize shape parameters using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss [Poole et al. 2022] based on T2I models [Jain et al. 2022; Xing et al. 2023b; Zhang et al. 2024], can be extended for style customization by fine-tuning T2I model on user-provided style examples. Although effective in adapting to new styles, these methods are time-consuming and often produce fragmented or cluttered paths. Such outputs overlook the inherent structural regularity and element relationships within SVG designs, making them difficult to edit or refine further. Feed-forward T2V methods, on the other hand, are trained on SVG datasets using large language models (LLMs) [Rodriguez et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2023] or diffusion models [Thamizharasan et al. 2024; Xing et al. 2024], maintaining SVG regularity and attaining high-quality outcomes within their respective training domains. However, style customization of the T2V model presents significant challenges. The absence of large-scale, general-purpose text-SVG datasets makes it difficult for the T2V model to disentangle content and style semantics, limiting its ability to generalize to new styles. Consequently, straightforward approach of fine-tuning base T2V model with only few exemplar SVGs, following T2I customization techniques [Hu et al. 2021; Kumari et al. 2022; Ruiz et al. 2022], often leads to overfitting on the exemplar SVGs. Nevertheless, acquiring sufficient number of consistent style sample SVGs for fine-tuning is impractical due to the scarcity of such data. Addressing these limitations, we propose novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation using only few exemplar SVGs. It combines the strengths of feed-forward T2V methods to ensure SVG structural regularity and T2I models to acquire powerful customization capabilities. In the first stage, we train T2V model on black-and-white SVG datasets to focus on learning the contents and structures of SVGs. In the second stage, we learn various styles of SVGs by distilling priors from different customized T2I models. Our two-stage pipeline also helps the T2V model explicitly disentangle content and style semantics. The aim of the first stage is to train T2V generative model tailored for style customization. Considering that LLM-based methods generate SVG code in an autoregressive manner, limiting their ability to utilize raster images as supervision, we adopt diffusion model as the base model to enable customization from the T2I model. As for the representation, global SVG-level representations [Xing et al. 2024] suffer from limited expressivity constrained by the dataset [Rombach et al. 2022], and point-level representations [Thamizharasan et al. 2024] are inefficient for complex SVGs. Thus, we select path-level representation [Zhang et al. 2024] that ensures both compactness and expressivity. In this stage, our path-level T2V diffusion model learns to generate SVGs that feature text-aligned content and exhibit structural regularity. In the second stage, we distill styles from T2I diffusion model to enable style customization for the T2V diffusion model. Specifically, we fine-tune the T2I model using small set of style images to generate diverse customized images, which serve as augmented data for training the T2V model. To facilitate image-based training, we employ reparameterization technique [Song et al. 2020] to compute SVG predictions and render them as images, enabling the T2V 2 Peiying Zhang, Nanxuan Zhao, and Jing Liao model to be updated via an image-level loss. After training, the T2V model can generate SVGs in learned custom styles corresponding to text prompts in feed-forward manner. We evaluate our method through comprehensive experiments across vector-level, image-level, and text-level metrics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in generating high-quality vector graphics with valid SVG structures and diverse customized styles, given input text prompts. Examples of style customization results produced by our framework are shown in Figure 1. Our key contributions are: We propose novel two-stage T2V pipeline to disentangle content and style in SVG generation, which is also the first feedforward T2V model capable of generating SVGs in custom styles. We design T2V diffusion model based on path-level representations, ensuring structural regularity of SVGs while maintaining diverse expressive capabilities. We develop style customization method for the T2V model by distilling styles from customized image diffusion models."

CLIP-based methods [Frans et al. 2022; Schaldenbrand et al. 2022; Song et al. 2022; Vinker et al. 2022] maximize image-text alignment within CLIP latent space. Recent works exploit Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss [Poole et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023b] to capitalize on the strong visual and semantic priors of T2I diffusion models. These methods can produce static [Iluz et al. 2023; Jain et al. 2022; Xing et al. 2023a,b; Zhang et al. 2024] or animated [Gal et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2024] SVGs aligned with text prompts. However, each optimization typically requires tens of minutes per SVG, making them impractical for real design scenarios. Alternatively, some commercial tools [Illustrator 2023; Illustroke 2024] integrate T2I models with vectorization techniques [Dominici et al. 2020; Favreau et al. 2017; Hoshyari et al. 2018; Kopf and Lischinski 2011; Ma et al. 2022; Selinger 2003] to convert raster images into SVGs. Despite their visually appealing results, these methods often include multiple fragmented paths and lack coherent layer relationships in SVGs, complicating further edits. While some methods [Warner et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023b] adapt paths from an exemplar SVG via semantic correspondences to preserve layer structure, they are unsuitable for style customization when the source and target differ significantly in semantics."

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods [Mangrulkar et al. 2022] propose modifying only specific network components, such as low-rank weight offsets [Frenkel et al. 2025; Hu et al. 2021], crossattention blocks [Kumari et al. 2022; Ye et al. 2023], or adapter layers [Mou et al. 2024; Sohn et al. 2023].

To preprocess the data, we follow the same steps as IconShop [Wu et al. 2023] to obtain valid SVG data and their corresponding text descriptions. Examples from the dataset are shown in Figure 3(a). For the raw SVG data, we convert all other primitive shapes (e.g., lines, rectangles and ellipses) into cubic Bézier curves, which are encoded as path embeddings as described in Section 4.1. Since the number of paths varies across SVGs, we pad the sequences of path tensors with zeros to fixed length of 32 and filter out SVGs with more paths.

By applying the DreamBooth-LoRA method [Hu et al. 2021; Ruiz et al. 2022], we create distinct LoRAs for each style. After fine-tuning, we concatenate unique token [𝑉 ] with the text prompt (e.g., \"in [𝑉 ] style\") to generate customized images in the corresponding style using the specific LoRA. Inspired by distillation techniques in T2I diffusion models [Luhman and Luhman 2021; Yin et al. 2024], which generate noise-image pairs by running the sampling steps of the teacher diffusion model 1https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 4 Style Customization of Text-to-Vector Generation with Image Diffusion Priors to train the student model, we apply similar approach to generate customized images as guidance for training.

Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the quality of our results from vector-level, image-level, text-level perspectives. For vector-level evaluation, we use path VAE [Zhang et al. 2024] trained on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset to encode SVG paths into latent vectors. We calculate the FID between these latents and the ground truth paths from FIGR-8-SVG, to evaluate how well the paths align with welldesigned vector graphics. For image-level evaluation, we evaluate the style alignment and the visual aesthetics of SVGs. We measure style alignment by calculating the average cosine similarity between ClIP image features of style references and rendered SVG images [Sohn et al. 2023]. We use the Aesthetic score [Schuhmann 2022] to evaluate the overall image quality. For text-level evaluation, we calculate the CLIP cosine similarity [Radford et al. 2021] between the text prompt and the rendered SVGs to measure semantic alignment. Baselines. We compare our proposed pipeline with two types of T2V generation schemes: optimization-based methods and feedforward methods. Optimization-based methods rely on pre-trained T2I models, so we first perform style-tuning on T2I diffusion models using the method described in Section 5.1. For vectorization with T2I methods, we generate customized images and optimize the SVGs to fit the images using two distinct vectorization techniques: traditional method, Potrace [Selinger 2003], and deep learning-based method LIVE [Ma et al. 2022]. For text-guided SVG optimization, we compare three approaches: VectorFusion [Jain et al. 2022] using SDS loss, SVGDreamer [Xing et al. 2023b] and T2I-NPR [Zhang et al. 2024], which use VSD loss. We use 64 paths for SVG optimization. To enhance alignment with the exemplar style, we begin by using the vectorized outputs from customized images as the initial SVGs. Feed-forward methods include language-based and diffusionbased approaches. For the former, we use GPT-4o [Achiam et al. 2023] to generate customized SVGs via providing curated in-context examples in the prompts. Specifically, we supply raster images and corresponding SVG scripts of the exemplar style and let GPT-4o act as an SVG code generator, to generate SVGs that match the style of the exemplars with the given text prompts. For the latter, since no diffusion-based T2V models are publicly available yet, we reproduce VecFusion [Thamizharasan et al. 2024] as base T2V model. To achieve style customization, we compare two approaches: (1) an vector-based fine-tuning method, in which we fine-tune VecFusion with small set of exemplar SVGs [Ruiz et al. 2022]; (2) neural style transfer (NST) method for SVG [Efimova et al. 2023], where we first generate an SVG using the base model, then select an exemplar SVG as the style reference and apply style transfer to the models output."

            "content": "We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing it with baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. The quantitative results are provided in Table 1 and the qualitative results are presented in Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 9 and Figure 10. As shown in Table 1, our method outperforms the others from comprehensive perspective. Comparisons with Optimization-based Methods. Vectorization with T2I methods reconstruct customized images through colorbased image segmentation and curve fitting. However, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 9(c), while Potrace [Selinger 2003] produces visually appealing outputs by faithfully reconstructing the customized images, it struggles with overly complex vector elements and lacks layer organization, as indicated by the higher Path FID in Table 1. This results in disorganized structures, reduced semantic clarity, and increased complexity in the SVGs. Such issues are common in image vectorization methods and contradict professional design principles, which prioritize simplicity and clarity in vector graphics. LIVE [Ma et al. 2022] faces similar challenges, producing SVGs containing numerous irregular and broken paths. Zoomed-in illustrations in Figure 9 highlight the issues of overcomplicated and fragmented paths (shown within green boxes). Text-guided SVG optimization methods leverage score distillation in T2I diffusion models to optimize set of shapes. VectorFusion [Jain et al. 2022] and SVGDreamer [Xing et al. 2023b] directly optimize the control points of paths to generate text-conforming SVGs. However, due to the high degrees of freedom, the paths may undergo complex transformations that result in jagged and cluttered shapes, leading to visually unappealing outcomes. T2V-NPR [Zhang et al. 2024] tackles the issue of irregular paths by learning latent representation of paths and reduces fragmentation by merging shapes with similar colors. However, while it produces smooth paths, it cannot guarantee the semantic integrity of the shapes, as the merging operation overlooks their semantic meaning. This can lead to semantically ambiguous paths, such as the merging of an owls eye with its wing, as shown in the first row of Figure 4. Overall, optimization-based methods that rely only on image supervision overlook the inherent design principles and layer structure of SVGs. Consequently, the generated SVGs often contain redundant shapes and disorganized layers, making them difficult Peiying Zhang, Nanxuan Zhao, and Jing Liao Table 1: Quantitative comparison with existing methods.

Moreover, these methods are time-consuming due to their iterative optimization, typically requiring tens of minutes per SVG, which makes them impractical for real design scenarios. In contrast, our T2V diffusion model learns vector properties, such as valid path semantics and layer structure, by training on well-designed SVG dataset. Our novel two-stage training strategy enables feedforward generation of well-structured SVGs in few seconds, while achieving visually appealing results in diverse custom styles. Comparisons with Feed-forward Methods. Regarding languagebased methods, though provided with in-context SVG examples, GPT-4o [Achiam et al. 2023] can only generate simple combinations of basic primitive shapes (e.g., circles and rectangles) to align with text prompts, as illustrated in Figure 5(a). It fails to produce the complex geometric details required for professional SVGs, resulting in outputs inadequate for graphic design. Although the original VecFusion model [Thamizharasan et al. 2024], trained on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset, generates high-quality 6 Style Customization of Text-to-Vector Generation with Image Diffusion Priors Figure 6: User Study. We show the human preferences in %. results within its trained domains, it cannot be extended to style customization using existing methods. When applying an vectorbased fine-tuning approach, where VecFusion is fine-tuned with small set of exemplar SVGs [Ruiz et al. 2022], its limited generalization ability prevents it from generating semantically correct SVGs in new custom styles. Instead, the model overfits to the exemplar SVGs, simply reconstructing them rather than adapting to diverse prompts. As result, the generated outputs exhibit high Style Alignment but poor Text Alignment in Table 1. NST [Efimova et al. 2023] applies style transfer to the SVGs generated by VecFusion using style loss in image space. Although this method directly inherits the original layer-wise properties, the optimized SVGs often have messy visual appearances. Furthermore, it struggles to capture fine-grained style features, leading to poor style consistency. In contrast, our method excels at adapting to the style, effectively capturing details from user-provided style, such as color schemes and design patterns. It achieves high visual quality while preserving the structure of the output SVGs."

We randomly selected 20 text prompts from the dataset and generated SVGs using both the baseline methods and our approach. Each question presented the results of different methods in random order, and 30 participants were given unlimited time to select the best result among five options for each evaluation metric. Figure 6 demonstrates the superior performance of our method, as it achieves the highest preference in all evaluation metrics. Specifically, our method obtains 53.2% of votes for overall SVG quality, 51.8% for style alignment, and 51.7% for semantic alignment. The results show the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality SVGs in custom styles from text prompts that align more closely with human perception."

Instead of using our path-level representation for training the T2V diffusion model, another baseline is to use global SVG-level representation. Following the DeepSVG [Carlier et al. 2020] architecture, we train transformer-based VAE on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset, where all paths with their properties (including the path order, control points and color) are encoded into single latent vector.

However, the global SVGlevel representation is constrained by the geometry and color limitations of the dataset, which restricts its ability to generate SVGs in only fixed style. As result, it fails to adapt to new custom styles, as shown in Figure 7(a). In contrast, our path-level representation maintains both compactness and expressivity, allowing for flexible and diverse SVG customizations. Ablation on Style Customization with Image Diffusion Priors. We compare our image-based style customization method with vectorbased fine-tuning approach. Specifically, in the second stage, we directly fine-tune our T2V model using small set of exemplar SVGs, following the fine-tuning techniques of T2I diffusion models [Ruiz et al. 2022]. However, as shown in Figure 7(b), this method leads to overfitting on the exemplar SVGs, causing the model to simply reconstruct them rather than aligning with the text semantics, as reflected by high style alignment score and low text alignment score in Table 2. In contrast, our style distillation method from image diffusion takes advantage of the strong visual priors in T2I diffusion models to generate customized images as augmented data, enabling diverse style customizations of SVGs."

For example, as shown in Figure 8(a), semantic elements like \"cello\" and \"cupcake\" are inaccurate when the text descriptions exceed the training domains capacity. This could be mitigated with larger and higher-quality SVG dataset with detailed annotations. Second, it may lose fine-grained stylistic details for overly complex style references, as depicted in Figure 8(b).
