Introduction Todays frontier Vision-Language Models (VLMs)GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro (et al., 2025), and Qwen3VL (Qwen Team, 2025)can describe images, answer questions, and perform general-purpose reasoning over visual content. Building upon foundational vision-language models such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), LLaVA (Li et al., 2023a), and BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023b), these systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding. Yet they remain fundamentally limited: they operate as monolithic inference engines that generate descriptive or conversational outputs but cannot act on visual data with precision, determinism, or compositional control. They lack the fine-grained tool integration, multi-step planning, and structured validation required for production-grade visual workflows. Orion is visual agent framework that can take in any modality and generate any modality, using an agentic framework with multiple tool calling capabilities geared towards visual AI tasks to generate state-of-the-art results. The frameworks core innovation lies in its ability to seamlessly process and produce diverse data typesimages, videos, documents, audio, and textwithin unified agentic architecture. This multi-modal flexibility enables Orion to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that require understanding, transformation, and generation across different data formats, from extracting structured information from documents to generating visual content from textual descriptions. The system integrates the cognitive capabilities of large VLMs with the precision of tens of hyper-specialized computer vision toolsincluding Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction, detection for object identification, segmentation for pixel-level analysis, pointing for spatial localization, diffusion for image generation, and geometric analysisorchestrated through an agentic architecture inspired by ReAct-style agent frameworks (Yao et al., 2023) and tool-augmented language models (Patil et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023). The agentic framework enables Orion to dynamically reason about task requirements, select appropriate tools from its extensive library, and compose them into sophisticated multi-step workflows. Unlike baseline VLMs that generate single-step responses, Orion dynamically constructs and executes multi-step workflows from natural language instructions, achieving higher degree of task success through intelligent tool orchestration and iterative refinement. Table 1 Comprehensive capability comparison showing unique features of Orion. Unlike monolithic LargeLanguage Models, Orion delivers comprehensive capabilities across all modalities and tasks. Specialized Skills refers to tasks such as object localization, segmentation, image generation/editing, or geometric tools typically found in specialized computer vision applications. In the table below, the symbols represent the following: Full support, No support, Partial support. Modality Task Orion GPT-5 Image / Video Document Understanding Reasoning Structured Outputs Specialized Skills Tool-Calling Understanding Reasoning Structured Outputs Specialized Skills Tool-Calling Gemini 2.5 Claude Sonnet 4.5 Qwen3-VL 235B The frameworks multiple tool calling capabilities enable it to tackle wide spectrum of visual AI tasks that 2 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution were previously intractable for monolithic models. By combining specialized tools for document understanding, image analysis, video processing, and cross-modal reasoning, Orion can perform complex operations such as extracting structured data from invoices, analyzing medical imaging, tracking objects across video sequences, and generating contextually appropriate visual content. The agentic nature of the framework allows it to adapt its approach based on the specific requirements of each task, selecting the optimal sequence of tools and adjusting its strategy based on intermediate results. This marks the transition from passive visual understanding to autonomous, tool-augmented visual intelligencea new category of agentic AI platform capable of combining deep neural perception, symbolic reasoning, and structured automation within unified system. Orion does not merely enhance existing multimodal models; it redefines what visual AI systems can achieve in complex, open-ended, and productioncritical environments. The frameworks ability to generate state-of-the-art results across diverse visual tasks stems from its unique combination of large-scale neural reasoning, specialized tool precision, and intelligent orchestration, enabling it to outperform both general-purpose VLMs and task-specific systems. Comprehensive evaluation across 46 diverse visual tasksranging from object detection and segmentation to complex multi-step visual reasoning, document analysis, and image generationdemonstrates that Orion consistently outperforms frontier VLMs including GPT-5 (Achiam et al., 2023), Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro (et al., 2025), and Qwen3-VL (Qwen Team, 2025). Evaluations span established benchmarks including MMMU (Yue et al., 2024), MMBench (Liu et al., 2024), and DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2021). As shown in Figure 17, Orion achieves superior performance across all evaluated categories, establishing it as the leading system for production-grade visual tasks that require precision, multi-step reasoning, and specialized tool integration. 3 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution 2. System Overview 2.1. System Architecture Figure 2 System architecture of Orion, illustrating the visual agent and its interaction with various visual tools, skills and code execution environments. Orion supports text, image, video and document inputs to answer questions (in multiple steps if possible) that may involve captioning, tagging, detection, generation or external tool-calling. See capabilities 3 section for more details. 2.1.1. Unified Orchestration with Planning, Execution and Reflection Orion implements ReAct-style agent controller (Yao et al., 2023) that combines large-language-model (LLM) based planner with multi-modal tool-calling execution engine and vision-language (VLM) based verifier. The core controller operates through three distinct phases (Plan-Execute-Reflect) in closed-loop: Plan Orion analyzes the users request to identify task intent and generates structured execution plan, leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) to decompose complex visual tasks. This planning phase determines the sequence of tool invocations, establishes data dependencies between operations, and evaluates the optimal choice of tools and execution order. The controller reasons about which visual processing capabilities are required and how they should be orchestrated to achieve the desired outcome. Execute The planned sequence of tools is executed according to the established execution plan. Tools are invoked either sequentially or in parallel, depending on dependency constraints and computational cost considerations. This flexible execution model allows Orion to maximize throughput while respecting data dependencies between operations. The execution engine integrates with multi-modal tool-calling capabilities including GPU-accelerated tool invocation to enable complex, multi-step visual reasoning and structured output validation. Reflect Intermediate and final outputs are evaluated against expected types and values to ensure correctness and consistency. This reflection phase identifies potential inconsistencies, validates visual output quality with respect to the inputs, and determines whether to retry failed operations, refine intermediate results, or finalize the completion request. The reflection mechanism enables Orion to course-correct and iteratively improve output quality throughout the execution process. 2.1.2. Multi-Modal Tool Execution Orion provides first-class visual reasoning and execution capabilities through comprehensive suite of specialized tools organized into four functional categories. The tool library comprises suite of distinct tools spanning document understanding, image analysis, video processing, and cross-modal reasoning tasks. Image Tools These tools include object detection for identifying and localizing visual entities, face recognition for identity verification, segmentation for pixel-level classification, and visual question answering for image-based reasoning tasks. 4 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution Document Tools These tools include Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction, layout detection for structural analysis, table extraction for tabular data parsing, form understanding for structured document processing, and keyword search for content retrieval within documents. Video Tools These tools include long-form visual transcription for video-to-text captioning, scene segmentation for temporal boundary detection, object tracking for motion analysis, and action recognition for activity classification. Mixed-modality Tools This category encompasses cross-modal retrieval for finding related content across modalities, visual redaction for privacy-preserving content masking, and region-level content extraction for targeted information retrieval. Each tool exposes standardized input/output interfaces that enable the controller to interpret and react to tool outputs dynamically. This standardization allows interleaved reasoning and re-interpretation of visual outputs, incorporating results from one tool as inputs to subsequent execution steps. The uniform interface design ensures composability and enables the controller to construct complex multi-step workflows without manual intervention. 2.1.3. Multi-Modal Context and Session Management The Orion system handles diverse input modalitiesincluding images, videos, documents, audio, and text, making it especially challenging to manage context without loss of information within the agents context window. The system implements adaptive context management that selectively retrieves only the context relevant to the current instruction, rather than maintaining the entire conversation history. This approach enables efficient processing in multi-turn conversations extending beyond 25 turns while maintaining coherent session state across complex, long-running interactions. 2.1.4. Reflection with Visual Judges The Orion system employs VLM-as-a-Judge (Lee et al., 2024) models to visually evaluate tool outputs against expected schemas, identify potential inconsistencies, and determine whether to retry, refine, or finalize the workflow. This reflection mechanism enables closed-loop control over the agents execution ensuring that intermediate and final results meet structural and semantic requirements of the original instruction. Conditional Execution & Closed Loop Control: The reflection framework enables conditional invocation of VLM-as-a-Judge tools to evaluate the outputs of other tools within the execution plan. By incorporating these evaluation checkpoints, the system iteratively refines outputs and course-corrects the overall visual reasoning and execution trajectory. This feedback loop allows the controller to detect errors early, trigger corrective actions, and progressively improve result quality without manual intervention, enhancing both robustness and reliability across complex multi-step workflows. 2.2. Key System Features Orion provides several distinctive capabilities enabling robust, flexible, and scalable multi-modal reasoning and execution in single unified API. Natively Multi-Modal Orion is truly multi-modal, with native support for handling images, videos, documents, audio, and text within the same conversation. All modalities are processed consistently, enabling seamless cross-modal reasoning and execution without requiring separate workflows or manual format conversions. Dynamic Routing Orion implements dynamic routing of complex instructions and tasks to more sophisticated models and tools as needed. When the controller detects that task exceeds the current agents capabilities, it can dynamically escalate to more powerful models or specialized tools, with graceful fallbacks ensuring robustness when preferred resources are unavailable. Dual-Mode Agent Design Orion supports dual-mode agent design, operating in both chat and structuredoutput modes to serve conversational and API-driven use cases. Chat mode provides natural-language interaction for exploratory workflows (e.g., visual chat - https://chat.vlm.run), while structured mode delivers type-safe, schema-validated outputs for deterministic execution with high reliability. Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution Closed-loop Reflection Orion incorporates closed-loop reflection to improve output quality and correctness. By evaluating intermediate and final results against expected schemas and semantic requirements, it iteratively refines outputs, detects errors early, and course-corrects execution trajectories without manual intervention. 2.3. Key API Features Orion exposes comprehensive API surface designed to support diverse integration patterns and use cases, from interactive conversational interfaces to programmatic batch processing pipelines. See our docs page for more details: https://docs.vlm.run/agents/introduction. Multi-Modal Input Support The API provides native support for passing images, videos, documents, audio, and text within the same conversation. Content can be provided via file identifiers or direct URLs, enabling flexible integration with existing storage systems and content delivery networks. This unified input mechanism eliminates separate endpoints or pre-processing steps for different modalities. 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 from vlmrun.client import VLMRun # Initialize the client client = VLMRun(base_url=\"https://agent.vlm.run/v1\", api_key=\"...\") # Example: Chat completion with multi-modal inputs image_file = client.files.upload(\"logo.jpg\") video_file = client.files.upload(\"racing.mp4\") messages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Place this logo in the racing ad video?\"}, {\"type\": \"input_file\", \"file_id\": image_file.id}, {\"type\": \"input_file\", \"file_id\": video_file.id} ]} ] # Perform chat completion chat_completion = client.agent.completions.create( model=\"vlmrun-orion-1:auto\", messages=messages, ) print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content) Streaming Chat Completion Interface The streaming interface supports real-time interaction by delivering responses incrementally as they are generated. This enables agents to reason, act, and respond incrementally, providing immediate feedback to users and allowing downstream systems to begin processing results before the entire response is complete. The streaming mechanism reduces perceived latency and enhances the interactive experience for conversational use cases. This can be done by simply adding stream=True to the client.agent.completsion.create call above. OpenAI Compatibility Orion implements fully OpenAI-compatible chat completions API, ensuring seamless integration with existing tools, libraries, and workflows built around the OpenAI ecosystem. The API includes streaming support for real-time interaction, enabling low-latency responses and progressive result delivery. 6 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 20 import openai from vlmrun.common.image import encode_image # Initialize the OpenAI client client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=\"https://agent.vlm.run/v1/openai\", api_key=\"...\") # Example: Chat completion with an image input messages = [ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What's in this image?\"}, {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": encode_image(image), \"detail\": \"auto\"}}, ]} ] # Perform chat completion chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"vlmrun-orion-1:auto\", messages=messages, ) print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content) Structured Outputs API Orion provides structured output capabilities with type-safe output validation. Results conform to predefined schemas and are validated against expected types and constraints before delivery. This ensures that downstream systems receive well-formed, predictable data structures suitable for programmatic processing, reducing integration complexity and improving reliability in automated workflows.

Extensions and Future Work Orion is designed with extensibility in mind, and several planned enhancements will further expand its capabilities and flexibility. Tool-Calling Support Future versions will provide the ability to call external or user-defined tools and services, enabling seamless integration of custom processing modules into the execution plan. This capability allows users to extend Orion with domain-specific algorithms, proprietary APIs, or specialized processing pipelines without modifying core system components. Code-Generation and Execution Planned support for automatic generation of computer-vision tools 7 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution on-the-fly will enable dynamic creation and execution of custom processing modules within the execution plan. This capability allows Orion to synthesize specialized tools tailored to specific task requirements, reducing the need for pre-built modules and enabling more flexible problem-solving approaches. Deeper LLM Integration The architecture will evolve to support hot-swappable model architecture compatible with all leading frontier model architectures. This includes open-source model families such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) and Qwen (Qwen Team, 2025; Team et al., 2024), as well as frontier model families including OpenAI GPT (Achiam et al., 2023), Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini (et al., 2025). This flexibility enables users to select models based on performance requirements, cost constraints, deployment environments, and specific task characteristics. 8 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution 3.

Structured Outputs core capability of Orion is robust, type-safe structured outputs for every step of agentic reasoning and execution. Unlike conventional LLM systems that produce free-form text, Orion emits outputs in strict, schemavalidated formatsenabling precise downstream processing, reliable tool chaining, and seamless integration into applications and APIs. Schema-driven Outputs Agents and tools are driven by explicit schemas, defining the required output types (e.g., arrays, key-value objects, tagged regions, time segments, entities). This ensures each step can be programmatically consumed and reliably orchestrated. Multi-modal Structured Data Multimedia outputs, returned in the form of pre-signed URLs, can include mixed-modality values (e.g., image crops, video clips, or generated documents) in single response, enabling unified downstream processing and interleaving of modalities across agent workflows. API Ready and OpenAI-Compatible All outputs conform to Pydantic-compatible JSON output formats, supporting direct integration into developer pipelines, evaluation systems, or end-user applications with minimal custom handling. This structured output paradigm unlocks agentic planning, iterative tool invocation, reliable evaluation, and advanced workflow composition within Oriontransforming visual reasoning from opaque black-box outputs to transparent and verifiable computation. 18 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution 4. Quantitative Evaluation We evaluate Orion across image, document, and video inputs, comparing its understanding, reasoning, and execution capabilities, against all frontier vision-language models. The benchmarks measure performance on diverse tasks including (but not restricted to) visual question answering, accurate text/object/face detection in images, document/video parsing and summarization, and more. 4.1. Benchmark Performance Our evaluation spans established multi-modal benchmarks including MMMU (Yue et al., 2024), MMBench (Liu et al., 2024), DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2021), and other comprehensive evaluation suites (Liu et al., 2023). In the coming weeks, we will be updating these sections with additional benchmarks and updated numbers as our agent evolves.

Bold indicates highest score per benchmark. 4.2. Human Evaluation Methodology To comprehensively assess Orions performance across diverse visual tasks, we conducted qualitative human evaluation comparing outputs from Orion, ChatGPT (GPT-5), Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across 46 diverse visual tasks. This evaluation methodology was designed to provide rigorous, unbiased assessment of model outputs across wide spectrum of visual AI capabilities, from object detection and segmentation to complex multi-step visual reasoning, document analysis, and image generation. Evaluation Design. To ensure objective assessment, we implement double-blind evaluation protocol where all model outputs are presented to evaluators in randomized order, labeled only as Model A, B, C, or D. Each task is evaluated by at least three independent evaluators who undergo calibration training to establish consistent scoring standards. Composite Overall Score. We develop composite overall score (010) that aggregates multiple dimensions of output quality. The score is calculated as weighted combination of four components: Helpfulness (30%), measuring whether the model addresses all the requested requirements; Correctness (35%), assessing factual correctness; Presentation (20%, for visual outputs), evaluating presentation and artifact-free rendering; and 19 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution Instruction Following (15%), determining whether the output meets specified constraints and requirements. Evaluation Process. Ten independent evaluators assess 46 diverse visual tasks spanning object detection, multi-step reasoning, medical image analysis, document processing, and image generation. For each task, evaluators receive the input and prompt, along with outputs from all four models in randomized order, and score each output independently across all four dimensions. Results and Analysis. The human evaluation results, visualized in Figure 17, demonstrate Orions superior performance across the majority of evaluated tasks. The double-blind design and multi-dimensional scoring ensure these results reflect genuine performance differences, establishing Orion as the leading system for production-grade visual tasks requiring precision, multi-step reasoning, and specialized tool integration. 4.3. Performance Analysis and Comparison As shown in Table 2, Orion demonstrates superior performance across multiple vision capabilities when compared to frontier vision-language models. The comprehensive benchmark results reveal that Orions agentic architecture, which orchestrates specialized computer vision tools, enables it to achieve more accurate and reliable performance across diverse visual understanding tasks compared to monolithic models. For an interactive version of the results showcased in the table 2, see our showdown page at https://chat.vlm.run/showdown. Reduced Hallucination and Enhanced Accuracy Orion exhibits significantly lower hallucination rates compared to other frontier models, as evidenced by its state-of-the-art performance on hallucination detection benchmarks. The systems ability to leverage precise visual analysis toolsincluding object detection, segmentation, and spatial reasoningenables it to ground its responses in actual visual content rather than generating hallucinated details. This tool-augmented approach provides built-in verification mechanisms that help the system distinguish between real visual information and spurious patterns, resulting in more trustworthy and accurate outputs across all vision tasks. Superior Multi-Capability Vision Performance. Orion demonstrates enhanced accuracy across multiple vision capabilities compared to other frontier models. The systems specialized tool suite enables precise execution of diverse visual tasks including object detection and localization, semantic and instance segmentation, optical character recognition, spatial reasoning, and multi-image understanding. Unlike monolithic models that rely solely on learned representations, Orion can invoke specialized tools to perform exact visual computationssuch as precise bounding box detection, pixel-level segmentation masks, and character-level OCRresulting in more accurate results across these fundamental vision capabilities. Comprehensive Visual Understanding. The benchmark results demonstrate that Orion achieves competitive or superior performance across wide spectrum of visual understanding tasks, from general visual question answering to specialized document analysis, chart interpretation, and multi-image reasoning. The systems ability to seamlessly integrate multiple vision tools within single agentic workflow enables it to handle complex visual scenarios that require combining multiple capabilitiessuch as detecting objects, extracting text, analyzing spatial relationships, and reasoning about visual contentmore accurately than models that attempt to perform all these tasks through single neural architecture. 20 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution Figure 17 Comprehensive evaluation results showing Orions superior performance across 46 diverse visual tasks compared to frontier Vision-Language Models. The evaluation demonstrates Orions consistent advantage in complex visual reasoning, specialized skill execution, and multi-step workflow completion. Production-Ready Reliability. The consistent performance improvements demonstrated across benchmarks indicate that Orions tool-augmented approach provides more reliable and accurate vision capabilities suitable for production deployment. The systems reduced hallucination rates and enhanced accuracy across multiple vision tasks make it particularly well-suited for real-world applications where precision and trustworthiness are critical. By combining neural reasoning with symbolic visual tools, Orion achieves balance between the flexibility of learned models and the precision of specialized computer vision algorithms, resulting in superior overall performance on image understanding and analysis tasks. 4.4. Future Work While Orion demonstrates significant capabilities in multi-modal reasoning and tool use, several directions remain for future exploration: Enhanced Benchmarking and Evaluation. Current multi-modal benchmarks predominantly focus on singleturn interactions and relatively simple tasks. This limitation stems largely from the difficulty of evaluating complex, multi-step outputs that require visual verification. We are developing comprehensive suite of benchmarks specifically designed to assess performance on intricate, multi-turn tasks where outputs must be visually validated against ground truth. Improved Tool Integration. Expanding the repertoire of available tools and refining the tool selection mechanism could further enhance the systems capabilities. This includes integrating domain-specific tools for specialized applications and developing more sophisticated strategies for tool composition. Efficiency Optimizations. While the current system achieves strong performance, there remain opportunities to optimize computational efficiency, particularly in reducing the number of inference calls required for complex tasks and improving the speed of tool execution. Robustness and Error Recovery. Enhancing the systems ability to detect and recover from errors, particularly in long-running multi-step tasks, represents an important area for improvement. This includes developing better mechanisms for self-correction and validation of intermediate outputs. 21 Orion: Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution Table 3 Comparison of Orion with frontier vision-language models across diverse tasks.

Discussion and Future Work Orion represents new paradigm in visual AI: agentic tool-augmented reasoning that combines the flexibility of large vision-language models (Li et al., 2023a,b; Radford et al., 2021) with the precision of specialized computer vision tools, extending the principles of tool-augmented language models (Patil et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023) to the visual domain. 5.1. Limitations and Challenges While Orion demonstrates strong performance, several challenges remain: Tool Selection Accuracy In complex scenarios with overlapping tool capabilities, the agent occasionally selects suboptimal tools. Future work will focus on learning from historical tool selection patterns, implementing cost-aware tool selection, and enabling dynamic tool specialization based on domain-specific requirements. Long-Horizon Planning For workflows exceeding 30+ steps, success rates decline due to error accumulation across many steps, difficulty maintaining coherent state over long sequences, and limited ability to backtrack and revise early decisions. Computational Cost While referencing multi-modal objects improve efficiency, complex workflows still require significant compute. Multiple LLM calls for planning and reflection, parallel tool execution infrastructure requirements, and the trade-off between quality and cost remain areas for optimization. 5.2. Broader Impact The introduction of tool-augmented visual agents has implications beyond technical performance. Democratizing Computer Vision Orion makes sophisticated computer-vision capabilities accessible to non-experts, enabling rapid prototyping of visual applications, allowing domain experts to build custom workflows without engineering teams, and reducing the barrier to entry for visual AI adoption. Interpretability and Trust Unlike black-box models, Orion provides transparent execution traces showing tool usage, explicit reasoning about tool selection, and the ability to audit and verify each step, fostering greater trust and accountability. Ethical Considerations The systems capabilities require careful consideration of privacy implications related to face recognition and tracking, potential misuse for surveillance or manipulation, bias propagation through tool selection and execution, and the need for human oversight in sensitive applications. We are committed to responsible development and deployment, working with domain experts and ethicists to establish appropriate safeguards."
