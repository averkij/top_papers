            "content": "Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in task planning in instruction-following tasks (Ahn et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022; Kovalev and Panov, 2022; Sarkisyan et al., 2023; Grigorev et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2024). However, it can be challenging for an agent, as some natural language instructions (NLI) from humans are ambiguous because of the natural language limitations in application to real world complex environment (Pramanick et al., 2022; Chuganskaya et al., 2023; Hu and Shu, 2023). distinct line of research focuses on developing methods for requesting user feedback, which is essential for handling tasks that are ambiguous and 1 Figure 1: Ambiguity types in the Ambik dataset. challenging even for humans. However, such methods (Zhang and Choi, 2023; Chen and Mueller, 2023; Su et al., 2024; Testoni and Fern√°ndez, 2024) are often developed for question answering (QA) tasks and do not take into account important features of embodied tasks. They differ from nonembodied scenarios in their need for task specificity, grounding, and real-world interactivity. Unlike chatbots, which operate in virtual domains, embodied systems must interpret instructions within physical contexts, ensuring safety, object awareness, and interactive adaptability. As emphasized in Madureira and Schlangen, 2024, clarification exchanges do not normally appear in non-interactive setting. Clarifications consist about 4% of spontaneous conversations, in comparison with 11% in instruction-following interactions. Therefore, advancing research in ambiguity detection is important for embodied agents. To address this task, some studies in robot task planning (Ren et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024) formulate the next action prediction problem as Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) task and use conformal prediction (CP) (Vovk et al., 2005) to derive subset from set of candidate options. If the subset contains single action, the robot executes it; otherwise, it requests clarification from the user. To compare the performance of these methods with the focus on ambiguous tasks, specialized benchmarks are needed. Existing datasets such as DialFred (Gao et al., 2022) and TEACh (Padmakumar et al., 2022) contain some ambiguous tasks, but they lack sufficient annotations to support dedicated ambiguity detection research. KnowNo (Ren et al., 2023) cannot be used as text-only benchmarks suitable for any LLM-based ambiguity detection methods, as it contains simple instructions with limited and inconsistent ambiguity types. Moreover, since the human-robot interaction pipeline typically includes many subparts, it is crucial to measure the LLM performance separately to improve the models ability to deal with unclear instructions. In our work, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the English language fully textual dataset for ambiguity detection in the kitchen environment. AmbiK consists of 2000 paired ambiguous and unambiguous instructions with description of the environment, an unambiguous counterpart of the task, clarifying question with an answer, and task plan. The kitchen domain was selected because it contains wide variety of objects with diverse sizes, complexities, and functions, providing rich environment for evaluating robots on multiple tasks. It is also commonly included in benchmarks and environments. Moving ahead of previous work, the types of ambiguity in AmbiK are based on the knowledge needed to resolve the ambiguity (see Figure 1). Ambiguous tasks are divided into three categories: HUMAN PREFERENCES, COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE, and SAFETY. Depending on the type, we expect an effective model to either ask for help or refrain from doing so. AmbiK allows for the comparison of both prompt-only and CP-based ambiguity detection methods. We evaluated three methods which use conformal prediction (KnowNo (Ren et al., 2023), LAP (Jr. and Manocha, 2024), and LofreeCP (Su et al., 2024)) and two baseline methods on the proposed dataset. The experiments are conducted on GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023b), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023c), Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) and Llama-3-8B (AI@Meta, 2024) models. The experiments demonstrated that handling ambiguity in AmbiK remains challenging for all tested methods. The main contributions of our paper are as follows: (i) We propose AmbiK, fully textual dataset in English for ambiguity detection in the kitchen environment. (ii) We propose definition of ambiguity and classify ambiguous tasks into three types PREFERENCES, COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE, and SAFETY based on our expectation of when the robot should trigger help; this classification is considered in measuring the robots performance. (iii) We evaluate three popular methods of ambiguity detection on the proposed dataset using SOTA LLMs. One of the methods was firstly used in the embodied agent task. (iv) We demonstrate that AmbiK presents significant challenge for the tested methods and that LLM logits are likely an inadequate approximation of uncertainty. The dataset, an environment list, and the prompts used in data collection are available online1."

            "content": "2.1 Datasets with Ambiguous NLI Clarification requests are part of many datasets: SIMMC2.0 (Kottur et al., 2021), ClarQ (Kumar and Black, 2020), ConvAI3 (ClariQ) (Aliannejadi et al., 2020) for general questions, but, as Madureira and Schlangen (2024) state, clarification exchanges more often appear in instruction-following interactions (Benotti and Blackburn, 2021; Madureira and Schlangen, 2023). Specialized instructionfollowing datasets in interactive environments often include comprehensive and grounded sessions of interactions. However, they tend to focus primarily on task completion rather than addressing ambiguities in natural language instructions. To such datasets belong Minecraft Dialogue Corpus (Narayan-Chen et al., 2019), IGLU (Kiseleva et al., 2022), CerealBar (Suhr et al., 2022), and LARC (Acquaviva et al., 2023). In DialFRED (Gao et al., 2022) and TEACh (Padmakumar et al., 2022) datasets, interactions occur in simulated kitchen environments, in the CoDraw game (Kim et al., 2017) the interaction is on the canvas for drawing. All these datasets have the same dialogue participants: commander who gives instructions and an instruction follower who executes them. Min et al. (2024) presents the Situated Instruction Following (SIF) dataset, which embraces the inherent underspecification of natural communication and includes ambiguous tasks. However, this ambiguity concerns only multiple locations for searching for objects and does not encompass linguistically complex diverse instructions. In the SIF dataset, ambiguous intents should be disambiguated through holistic understanding of the en1https://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset 2 Table 1: Comparison of datasets with ambiguous NLI. 2.2 Ambiguity Detection Methods m o C I 1639 480 2 636 480 Fully textual? Number of household tasks Ambiguous instructions Multiple ambiguity types Clarification questions Can be used as textual benchmark? 2000 1000 170 vironment and the humans location, rather than by triggering human assistance. Tanaka et al. (2024) focus on ambiguity defined as the unexpressiveness of the users intent (requests that are implied but not directly stated) and should be addressed proactively by the robot. This interpretation of ambiguity differs from ours (see Section 3.1). The KnowNo dataset (Ren et al., 2023) is completely textual and contains ambiguous tasks, but they constitute small part of the dataset (170 samples). These tasks do not come with questions to resolve ambiguity or other hints for the model. The tasks in KnowNo are one-step and simply formulated, with only about three or four objects in the scene. Tasks are divided into multiple subtypes, but the division is not fully consistent. For instance, along with the unambiguous type with direct object naming, there is separate type of naming the objects using referential pronouns. However, in an unambiguous setting, this is common ability of LLMs and can hardly be considered separate type alongside different ambiguous types. Situational Awareness for Goal Classification in Robotic Tasks (SaGC) (Park et al., 2023) is intended to classify tasks into certain, infeasible (regarding robot specialization), and ambiguous tasks. However, ambiguity in their sense is just underspecification of the task (like cook something delicious) which can have multiple true ways of ambiguity resolution that do not necessarily assume communicating with human. When using only textual data and considering ambiguous instructions, the existing datasets are insufficient for comparing methods of LLM uncertainty. To address this gap, we introduce AmbiK, dataset specifically designed for this purpose (see Table 1 for comparison). 2SIF authors report 480 tasks, but since each can appear in both ambiguous and unambiguous forms, the total number of tasks can be considered 960. 3 In interactive robotics, the simplest approach to determining when to request clarification is to fewshot prompt an LLM with examples of seeking assistance, as demonstrated in Mandi et al. (2023); Dai et al. (2024). While these methods are applicable to both black-box and white-box models, they offer the least transparency. Most approaches addressing this problem rely on model logits to provide more systematic and interpretable measure of uncertainty and ambiguity. In some works (Chi et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2022) uncertainty is measured through heuristics such as the difference in confidence scores (entropy) between the top two predictions if it falls below user-defined threshold, the model should seek clarification. separate line of research focuses on applying conformal prediction (Vovk et al., 2005) to measure LLM uncertainty and make decisions based on these measurements. Conformal prediction (CP) is model-agnostic, distribution-free approach for deriving subset of candidate options, ensuring, with user-defined probability, that the subset contains the correct option. As in Ren et al. (2023); Liang et al. (2024), If CP narrows the set of candidate actions to single option, the robot executes it; otherwise, the robot requests the user to clarify the action to be performed. CP is compatible with various uncertainty estimation methods (see an overview of uncertainty estimation methods in Fadeeva et al. (2023); Huang et al. (2024)), for instance, SoftMax scores can be used as an uncertainty measure (Angelopoulos and Bates, 2022). The study in Lidard et al. (2024) suggests an improvement of KnowNo (Ren et al., 2023) by considering the risk associated with uncertain action selection. Although heuristic uncertainty estimation recent work introduced is required for CP, LofreeCP (Su et al., 2024), CP-based approach that is compatible with logit-free models and outperforms logit-based methods. In this work, we implemented two CP-based methods originally introduced in the robotics domain (KnowNo and LAP) and one logit-free method (LofreeCP), marking the first application of this method to our task. Additionally, we implemented two simple methods, Binary and No Help, which served as baselines in the KnowNo paper."

            "content": "3.1 Ambiguity Definition For the purposes of this work, we define instruction ambiguity as follows: An instruction is said to be ambiguous if, given the state of the environment, at least one step in the process of constructing plan allows for multiple possible choices. wrong choice at that step may lead to undesirable consequences. Conversely, unambiguous instructions typically do not present such choices. This definition is suitable for testing ambiguity detection methods in paired setting, as it allows for the comparison of models uncertainty between similar unambiguous and ambiguous tasks. In this work, ambiguity is considered in zerocontext setting, meaning that we do not account for previous sessions of human-robot interaction. For instance, in real setting, we expect no confusion if robot receives the task Put the cup on the kitchen table after the task Bring me the ceramic cup, even if multiple cups are given. In AmbiK, the task Put the cup on the kitchen table would always be ambiguous with multiple cups in the environment. We impose zero context to allow for fair comparison of methods and to keep PREFERENCES consistently ambiguous; the setting is unrelated to task plans, as we allow the context of previous actions within the scope of single task. The sentences in pairs of AmbiK tasks are linguistically minimal in their differences and are grounded in the same textual environment. Compared to similar unambiguous tasks, ambiguous instructions offer more interpretations and are more likely to result in choice of the next action given the set of objects in the environment. For example, an instruction like Pick up the cup may be ambiguous in one scene (with multiple cups) but not in another (with only one cup). The same is true for the intended action sequence, manner of action (e. g., the sauce added to the dish either abruptly or slowly) or other forms of ambiguity."

            "title": "3.2 Ambiguity Types in AmbiK",
            "content": "There are many ways to categorize ambiguous tasks. For instance, the division can be based on linguistic ambiguity (such as ambiguous references and synonyms/hypernyms), spatial ambiguity, safety ambiguity, or the degree of creativity required for the task, as seen in the Hardware Mobile Figure 2: Examples of ambiguous tasks in AmbiK across ambiguity types. For COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE, it can be unclear to the robot which kitchen item to use for toasting bread (a toaster). In SAFETY which plate to use for buffalo wings (any microwave-safe one). Manipulator dataset (Ren et al., 2023). However, such classifications lack an internal system, as such semantic and linguistic divisions do not correlate with various action strategies of the robot receiving such tasks. For instance, spatial ambiguity is not really different from object ambiguity in the sense that in both cases, the robot needs clarifications. Moreover, restricting to objects and space is not exhaustive, as we can come up with unlimited ways of overlapping semantic classes (ambiguity on manner of action, speed of action, final object location, temporary location, etc.). Thus, ambiguity types in AmbiK are aligned with various ways the embodied agent should act in ambiguous situations. We divide ambiguous tasks into (HUMAN) PREFERENCES, COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE and SAFETY types, see Figure 1 for the data distribution over types. This distribution corresponds to 42%, 42.5%, and 15.5% of the task pairs, respectively. The examples for each type are presented in Figure 2. For PREFERENCES, the good model should ask question in all the cases, as the human preferences can be inherently variable and unpredictable. For SAFETY and COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE, the model should limit its question frequency to align with human behavior patterns. We examine safety ambiguity separately from common sense knowledge because incorrect choices in response to ambiguous instructions are associated with more serious risks for both humans and the robot. It is also less undesirable for the robot to ask obvious questions if they concern safety. We propose this division into types because we assume that humans interact with embodied agents nearly as they interact with other humans and that they consider cooperative principles, also called Grices maxims of conversation (Grice, 1975). Cooperative principles describe how people achieve effective conversational communication in common social situations and are widely used in linguistics and sociology. According to Grice, we are informative (maxim of quantity content length and depth), truthful (maxim of quality), relevant (maxim of relation) and clear (maxim of manner), if humans are interested in the communicative task completion. For this reason, for example, we do not expect LLMs to ask whether vegetables should be washed before making salad, as it is generally understood that they should be. If human prefers unwashed vegetables, it becomes their responsibility to inform the robot of this preference. 3.3 AmbiK Structure In total, AmbiK contains 1000 pairs of tasks, categorized by ambiguity type (UNAMBIGUOUS and three ambiguity types). In this section, we describe the data structure using examples. See Table 4 in Appendix for other details. All tasks have the environment description in the textual forms, such as ceramic mug, glass mug, clean sponge, dirty sponge, coffee, coffee machine, milk glass, green tea bag. The task in AmbiK is represented in the form of unambiguous and ambiguous formulations. For example, the unambiguous task Kitchen Robot, please make coffee by using the coffee machine and pour it into ceramic mug. has an ambiguous counterpart Kitchen Robot, please make coffee by using the coffee machine and pour it into mug. These tasks differ at the certain point of the instruction plan (pouring the coffee). As there are multiple mugs in the scene, the robot can not be sure about this point. The ambiguity type of this task pair is PREFERENCES, because we expect the agent to ask clarifying question. Each task pair is associated with user intent the action assumed in the task, which can be expressed through multiple concepts and formulations (see Appendix A). The ambiguity shortlist is defined only for tasks of type PREFERENCES that exhibit uncertainty regarding objects. It comprises set of objects among which we anticipate human indecision (a glass mug, ceramic mug). Variants are used only for methods with the calibration stage, as they require all possible correct answers to define the CP values. For each task, AmbiK also includes questionanswer pair to facilitate task disambiguation. However, since the tested methods typically do not offer concrete approach for generating clarification questions, we do not evaluate them based on their ability to formulate the relevant question. AmbiK structure enables testing different ambiguity detection methods in task planning with LLMs. Furthermore, AmbiK is suitable for testing methods that rely on list of objects in the environment (such as LAP), and it supports experimental settings both before and after human-robot dialogue, where ambiguity needs to be resolved. 3.4 Data Collection The data were collected with the assistance of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a) and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) models, then validated by humans. Firstly, we manually created list of more than 750 kitchen items and food grouped by objects similarity (e.g. different types of yogurt). We randomly sampled from the full environment (from 2 to 5 food groups + from 2 to 5 kitchen item groups) to get 1000 kitchen environments. From every group, the random number of items (not less than 3) is included in the scene. Some kitchen items (a fridge, an oven, kitchen table, microwave, dishwasher, sink, tea kettle) are present in every environment. For each of the 1000 scenes, we generated an unambiguous task using Mistral and manually selected the best 1000 without hallucinations. For every unambiguous task, we generated an ambiguous task and question-answer pair using ChatGPT. We used three different prompts, each corresponding to one of the ambiguity types in AmbiK. Based on the ambiguous task, we then manually selected the ambiguity type which corresponds to the ambiguity, which could occur in real human-robot interaction. See Appendix for all used prompts. Finally, we manually reviewed all the answers according to specially created annotation guidelines (see Appendix I). Three people from our team annotated the data, achieving an inter-annotator agreement of over 95%."

The methods we compared on AmbiK differ in how initial notions of uncertainty are calculated. We also test two simple methods which do not use CP: Binary and No Help (Ren et al., 2023). For all ambiguity detection methods, the few-shot prompting was used for generating options by LLM, see Appendixes and H. KnowNo. This method was the first popular method that used CP with LLM in embodied agents. In KnowNo, LLM is asked to generate multiple answer options and to choose the best option. SoftMax of logprobs, which correspond to all option letters are utilized as inputs for CP. LAP. This approach is similar to KnowNo, but the received log probabilities of generated variants are additionally multiplied by affordance scores. For every option, Context-Based Affordance indicates whether all mentioned objects are in the environment, Prompt-Based Affordance equals the probability that LLM answers True to the request if it is possible and safe to execute the action.

As choosing model for the experiments with methods which require it (see Section 4), we also used the Flan T57 model (Chung et al., 2022) for choosing between 4 options in the experiments in KnowNo and LAP and certainty statements in Binary. Experiments with the Flan-T5 model were conducted on half of the dataset. All experiments using local models were performed on single NVIDIA A100 GPU. 3The Help Rate is standard metric for CP-based approaches, as it follows the idea of asking for help when the CP set contains more than one element (Ren et al., 2023; Su et al., 2024).

            "content": "In this section, we present and analyze the experimental results. Figure 3 and Table 8 in Appendix present the ICR performance of different models across types of ambiguity in AmbiK. Methods generally perform worse on ambiguous tasks compared to UNAMBIGUOUS tasks for both models. Using GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5 leads to improved performance for the LAP and LofreeCP methods, while results either remain the same or worsen for the KnowNo and Binary methods. Notably, when using Llama-2 as both the generation and the choosing model results in zero performance. HR and CHR for the experiments are given in Table 9 in Appendix E. Generally, CHR is low regardless of the method, and it is often either 0 or 1, regardless of ambiguity type, indicating that the CP set size of the methods is usually similar for ambiguous and unambiguous tasks. In Figure 4, SSC scores for all experiments with CP-based methods (KnowNo, LAP, LofreeCP) are shown. The results indicate that the size of the CP sets does not change depending on ambiguity types, usually remaining at 0. In Table 3, AmbDif scores for all experiments on AmbiK are provided. None of the tested methods, except for LofreeCP, achieve even 10% on the metric, demonstrating their inability to distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous tasks. Overall, the evaluated methods perform poorly on AmbiK, with all tested LLMs. Based on these results, we conclude that AmbiK is highly challenging dataset for modern SOTA ambiguity detection methods. Specifically: 1. No Help method performs the worst: relying solely on the Top-1 prediction is insufficient. 2. No method achieves even 20% of SSC (Figure 4), indicating that CP sets are not aligned with the actual ambiguity sets. 3. The embodied agent typically either never requests help or always does so, indicating inability to handle ambiguity effectively (Table 9 Appendix E). 4. LLM cannot distinguish between examples from the pair, leading to confusion due to the linguistic similarity of the tasks (Figure 3). Next, we delve into detailed examination of the specific aspects of the results. Performance depending on ambiguity type. The ICR performance on PREFERENCES, COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE and SAFETY tasks (Figure 3, graphics b-d) is particularly weak compared to UNAMBIGUOUS tasks (graphics), meaning that ambiguity presents significant challenge for LLMs to handle effectively. This underscores the importance of including ambiguous instructions in benchmarks to better evaluate and improve the models capabilities. CP-based methods vs. Binary. While the tested methods show minimal differences in HR and CHR performance, significant variability arises in ICR efficiency (Figure 3). Contrary to expectations that CP-based methods would surpass simpler approaches, the one-step Binary method produced more accurate prediction sets than KnowNo, LAP, and LofreeCP in most cases. These results suggest that the Binary method may be more effective for this purpose than CP-based alternatives. 7 Table 3: Ambiguity Differentiation on AmbiK. The notation Llama-2-7B + FLAN-T5 indicates that Llama2-7B generates MCQA variants while FLAN-T5 selects among the options. LofreeCP and NoHelp involve only single round of querying the LLM and, consequently, do not employ choosing model (NA in the table). KnowNo, LAP, and Binary methods follow two-step process.

Among the four methods achieving non-zero performance, the two that do not rely on internal model information outperform the logitbased methods. This supports the previous observation that model logits are often miscalibrated and lead to degraded performance (Lin et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024). Human intervention and LLM confidence. According to the HR, most methods rarely trigger human intervention. This is likely because the models (GPT especially) assign much higher scores to the Top-1 option compared to other options. Consequently, the CP set typically contains only one option. This behavior would be particularly beneficial only for ambiguous tasks of the PREFERENCES type. Our findings align with previous observations 8 that LLMs fine-tuned with RLHF, and GPT models in particular, tend to be overconfident (Lin et al., 2022; Kadavath et al., 2022; He et al., 2023). For more comprehensive understanding of the results, we conducted additional experiments in two specific scenarios: (i) testing the same methods using the KnowNo dataset and (ii) prompting the LLM with single action, rather than the full plan of actions up to the current step. AmbiK vs. KnowNo dataset. We hypothesize that the high metric values achieved by the KnowNo approach stem from the simplicity and uniformity of the tasks in its test sample. To assess whether more challenging benchmark is warranted, we replicated the KnowNo experiment from the original paper using GPT-3.5 (in place of text-davinci-003 from the original study). The experiment was conducted on the KnowNo Hardware Mobile Manipulator dataset (300 tasks). The findings (Help Rate8 = 0.8, Success Rate = 0.79) are consistent with the original KnowNo results. Furthermore, we tested other methods on KnowNo data, finding that their performance fell short compared to the KnowNo approach (see Table 7 in Appendix E). While the metrics in the KnowNo and AmbiK experiments are not directly comparable, our findings indicate that all approaches yield significantly lower performance on the more complex AmbiK benchmark. Prompting LLM with single action vs. fullplan context. In the original works, the KnowNo and LAP methods were tested on one-step instructions (e.g., pick up an apple). However, AmbiK includes multi-step plans for more complex tasks. We experimented with forming the input for these methods both with and without the previous steps of the task plan. In the latter case, the task is reduced to one-step action (the potentially ambiguous step). Due to the limited budget, we conduct this experiment on GPT-3.5-Turbo. Table 6 in Appendix compares ICR of tested methods in both full-plan and action-only settings. There is no significant difference in the performance of the methods when previous actions are included as input. However, providing plans slightly improves the ICR score for KnowNo and LAP. For the Binary method, giving only one action performs better on ambiguous tasks but worse on unambiguous ones. For LofreeCP, the results are identical. 8Note that while we calculate metrics based on the original pipeline, we have different perspective on assigning the same Help Rate value to both ambiguous and unambiguous tasks. The findings suggest that providing the previous actions can be beneficial for CP-based methods, probably because the LLM gets more context."

            "content": "The evaluation of three CP-based and two straightforward ambiguity detection methods on AmbiK reveals the significant challenges current SOTA methods face when addressing ambiguity, as they generally performed poorly across all ambiguity types and various LLMs. The findings highlight the limitations of using logits as proxy for uncertainty and the essential need to re-query the model to achieve better performance. We hope that the AmbiK dataset, with its multi-step, real-world scenarios, will advance the field."

            "title": "7 Limitations\nWhile the AmbiK dataset provides a valuable re-\nsource for advancing research in handling ambigu-\nous tasks in kitchen environments, there are several\nlimitations that must be acknowledged.",
            "content": "Using Only Textual Data. In this work, we rely solely on list of objects as the scene description, without considering relationships between these objects, either in textual form or as scene graphs. Additionally, we do not incorporate images or other forms of representations, as our focus is specifically on testing LLMs. This approach aligns with practices in other methods, such as KnowNo (Ren et al., 2023), which similarly utilize object lists for their descriptions. Extending our approach to include richer descriptions, such as object relationships or visual data, would be valuable avenue for future research, but it falls outside the scope of this study. Focus on Ambiguous Tasks with One Intent. In AmbiK, all ambiguous tasks are designed to have only one interpretation intended as correct by the user. However, in real-life settings, robot might receive instructions such as Bring me something sweet, which could have multiple valid interpretations. While the approach presented in this paper is readily extendable to handle such cases, we focus exclusively on tasks with single correct interpretation in the current study. Focus on Uncertainty Handling. Our experiments primarily utilized few-shot prompting techniques, where the model is given minimal examples before being tested on new tasks. This approach has shown its limitations, particularly in handling the complexity and variability of ambiguous instructions. Few-shot learning is useful for rapid prototyping, but it often falls short in scenarios that require deep understanding and nuanced disambiguation. Fine-tuning can yield better performance and more reliable handling of ambiguities. Few-Shot Evaluation Limitations. The primary objective of the AmbiK dataset is to evaluate models ability to handle uncertainty and ambiguity in instructions rather than to develop comprehensive plan for given task. This focus means that the dataset and associated evaluations are designed to test how well model can identify and resolve ambiguities, rather than its overall task planning capabilities. While this is critical aspect of Embodied AI, it does not address other important elements of task execution and planning. Domain Constraints. The dataset is limited to actions performed by robot in kitchen environment. This narrow focus restricts the generalizability of the findings to other domains where ambiguity and uncertainty might be handled differently. The addition of other household tasks (cleaning the room, helping with other chores) and other environments (working in the garage, grocery store, etc.) we consider important for further research. Cultural and Linguistic Variability. The instructions and tasks in the AmbiK dataset are based on English language and cultural norms commonly found in kitchen environments. This cultural and linguistic specificity may limit the applicability of the dataset to non-English speaking contexts or cultures with different culinary practices and norms."

Preprint, arXiv:2306.13063. Appendix AmbiK Structure Details The full structure of the dataset with examples is presented in Table 4. Additional information about the annotation of AmbiK is given below. User intents. User intents represent the action assumed in the task and can be expressed through multiple concepts. These concepts are typically one or few words, separated by comma. Words that are included in user intents are not necessarily full English words; they can be any substrings expected to be present in the correct action (for instance, we expect the substring heat when both answers heat and preheat are correct). They can also include whitespace characters. If concept can be named in multiple ways, all variants are separated using (e. g., fridgerefrigerator). If concept should not be present in the correct action, minus sign is used before the concept (one word or words separated by , e.g. -oven mitts). Compared to other datasets, complex user intents allow for the calculation of various metrics based on the principle that the more concepts from the intent are included in the LLM-generated option, the better. This approach distinguishes partially correct answers from completely wrong ones. Variants. Variants are only used during the calibration stage. For PREFERENCES, the variants duplicate the ambiguity shortlist. For other examples, the correct variants duplicate the user intents, as there is limited number of common-sense and safety-related correct options in the defined environment. The separator for variants is an enter; otherwise, the notation rules are the same as for user intents. Thus, we constructed the variants from the ambiguity shortlist and user intents and revised them manually. Appendix AmbiK Statistics In this section, more details on AmbiK statistics are provided. Environment. The environment is represented in textual form. Each task consists of at least 4 objects, excluding kitchen appliances, which are always present in the task.

            "content": "(1) ICR is directly related to task performance quality. The ideal model in this task is not only one that asks for help when needed but also understands the source of the ambiguity and can ask the appropriate clarification question. This goes beyond simply determining whether to ask for help. Help Rate (HR). Whether the robot asks for help, assuming it does it when its Prediction Set Size SS (after applying Conformal Prediction) is greater than 1. (cid:40) HR = 1, if SS > 1 0, otherwise (2) This metric is particularly important for understanding the models behavior across different ambiguity types. For example, suppose model has zero HR for Safety tasks (which theoretically is optimal) but also fails to ask for help in other ambiguous situations. In that case, this indicates an inability to handle ambiguity effectively. Additionally, HR is standard metric for embodied ambiguity detection tasks and is included for consistency with prior work, ensuring easier comparability. Correct Help Rate (CHR). How often planner correctly chooses whether to ask for clarifications from user. Given that we expect the model to behave differently depending on the type of ambiguity (see Figure 1), CHR is calculated using one of two formulas. For PREFERENCES: (cid:40) CHR = 1, if HR = 1 0, otherwise (3) For COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE, SAFETY, UNAMBIGUOUS tasks: (cid:40) CHR = if HR = 1 1, 0, otherwise (4) CHR is equivalent to accuracy but is framed in the context of our task deciding whether to ask for help. The naming emphasizes its direct connection to HR, helping readers relate the two metrics. Set Size Correctness (SSC). The accordance of Prediction Set (P S) and Correct Set (CS) options, calculated as their Intersection over Union. SSC = CS CS (5) We consider Set Size Correctness only for tasks that represent ambiguity over objects in the PREFERENCES type. This is because the prediction set for this category can be clearly defined by imagining the objects between which person might be ambiguous. Set Size Correctness was inspired by the Prediction Set Size metric, which is commonly used in works that employ the Help Rate. 14 Table 6: Intent Coverage Rate of GPT-3.5 with plans (before the slash) and without plans (after the slash) on AmbiK.

(cid:40) AmbDif = if SSamb > SSunamb 1, 0, otherwise (6) AmbDif = 1 holds if SSunamb = 0. For the Binary method, AmbDif = 1 if the unambiguous task is labeled certain, while its ambiguous pair is labeled uncertain, and 0 otherwise. Ambiguity Differentiation is specifically designed for our dataset and our definition of ambiguity, although similarly calculated metrics are used for various paired datasets. Unlike the CHR or F1 score, AmbDif is pair-specific and is calculated based on whether the model can recognize subtle differences in ambiguity and adjust its behavior accordingly. This makes it independent of the other metrics and essential for understanding the models performance.

We tested all considered methods on KnowNo data, finding that their performance fell short compared to the KnowNo approach.

Annotators were also encouraged to ask any questions regarding the instructions or seek clarification on difficult examples. Instruction for AmbiK data labelling There are two parts in this instruction: Part 1 is general description of the dataset, its structure, the task for which it was created, and the definition of ambiguity; Part 2 describes the procedure for specific actions during labelling (with examples). This instruction is large because it is detailed, but in fact, labelling one row of the dataset (two tasks: unambiguous in two versions and ambiguous) takes no more than 3-4 minutes. Do not hesitate to ask questions, you can write to the mail <MAIL> or <SOCIAL MEDIA CONTACT>. Thanks! Part 1: Description of the dataset. AmbiK (Dataset of Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment) is textual benchmark for testing various methods of detection and disambiguation using LLM. Domain: housework tasks for embodied agents (robots). The AmbiK dataset is in English, the environments for the tasks are compiled manually, and the tasks are generated using Mistral and ChatGPT, so we ask you to check what they have generated. One row of the dataset contains pair of unambiguous-ambiguous tasks. We consider unambiguous tasks to be tasks that person with knowledge about the world that people usually have could perform in given environment without clarifying questions. We consider ambiguous tasks to be those that would raise questions from human OR that might not be obvious to robot if it does not have some knowledge about the world that humans possess. (The examples will be clearer later!) The unambiguous task is presented in two formulations (see Table 10 below). An ambiguous task is obtained from an unambiguous one by eliminating part of the information (for example, an indication of specific object that the robot needs to take), i.e. unambiguous and ambiguous tasks are almost the same. At the moment there are 250 unambiguous + 250 ambiguous tasks, the goal is to collect another 750 pairs of tasks. The complete structure of the dataset is shown in Table 10 below (using the example of one row). Dataset <LINK>: The final tab is an example of what should happen. Columns L-W (highlighted in color) are intermediate (i.e. they are deleted in the final version of the Table 10: Dataset Structure.

Part 2: The layout of the dataset fields It is better to view and complete each line of the dataset in the following order: 1. unambiguous_direct: This task (unambiguous and with clear name of the objects) was generated using Mistral and previewed. check for adequacy, correct if necessary If the example is completely strange (a recipe for mixing wine and mayonnaise), delete the line completely. check that all the objects mentioned in the task (food and appliances) are in the environment (environment_short/environment_full) or in the list of objects that are always there: fridge, an oven, kitchen table, microwave, dishwasher, sink and tea kettle If several objects are missing, you need to add them to environment_short without an article and to environment_full with an article (or without an article, if English grammar requires it) 2. unambiguous_indirect: This task (unambiguous and with vague naming of objects paraphrasing, using demonstrative pronouns, etc.) was generated using ChatGPT. check for adequacy and compliance within the meaning of unambiguous_direct. Conventionally, person should read unambiguous_direct and unambiguous_indirect and equally understand what to do. 3. ambiguity_type, ambiguous_task: Ambiguous tasks of all three types and question-"

            "content": "answer pairs were generated using ChatGPT. pref_raw, common_raw and safety_raw columns, you need to choose ONE of the most successful (logical and natural-sounding) ambiguous tasks. These columns correspond to the ambiguity types preferences, common sense knowledge, and safety. The types of tasks and examples for each type are described in Tables 11 and 12 below. It is necessary to view the options for ambiguous tasks in the order safety > common sense > 22 preferences, because the type of safety is the most difficult type to collect. The easiest one is preferences. If safety sounds adequate, you need to choose it, even if you prefer preferences. The primary task is to collect more ambiguous tasks like safety. All types of ambiguous tasks, especially safety and common sense knowledge, can be very similar to each other in specific cases. For example, what is considered the robots clarification do wash vegetables? for the make salad task: minimum safety precautions, general knowledge of the world (not washing vegetables is not very dangerous, but they are usually washed) or the preferences of the user (a specific person in theory may want salad of unwashed vegetables)? In such cases, you can reason like this: if stranger told me to make salad, would ask if need to wash the vegetables? If not, then, apparently, this is some kind of safety knowledge/common sense knowledge about the world that people usually do not express (because they assume that other people also have this knowledge). So this is definitely not user preference. For user preferences (imagine stranger giving you instructions), you always need to clarify the task. The boundary between safety and common sense knowledge about the world is conditional (in fact, safety regulation is part of general knowledge about the world, but it is important for us to evaluate it separately), therefore, in your opinion, if it is rather dangerous not to wash vegetables, then it can be attributed to safety, otherwise to common sense knowledge about the world. Important: as result, there should be only one type of ambiguity, that is, you need to choose 1 ambiguous task and 1 corresponding pair of questionanswer to it! The selected task can be slightly adjusted, if you consider it necessary. The task must be adjusted if, for example, you understand from questionanswer pair what ambiguity was meant, but the ambiguous task turned out to be unambiguous. This task should be written to ambiguous_task, and the type of the selected task should be written to ambiguity_type. Often, the task generated by the chat is unambiguous, but the question-answer for each task can restore, which could be ambiguous here. There should be one ambiguity for this environment and this task, i.e. we change tasks like Put yogurt into bowl if there are two types of yoghurts Behavior of good model always asks for clarification usually doesnt asks usually doesnt asks Table 11: Description of the types of ambiguous tasks. Task type What is needed for disambiguation preferences unique and fickle desires of the user safety common _sence _knowledge general knowledge of the world: safety rules common knowledge about the world: knowledge about the size of things (any spoon fits in the sink, but not any pan, for the task Put it in the small pot is most likely about an egg, not about kilogram of potatoes); knowledge about what objects are usually done with and what commands the robot could receive (Wash it and put it on the table hardly applies to microwave or chips; to wash the dishes, you need to take clean sponge with detergent, not dirty); other knowledge that they normally possess people Table 12: Examples of unambiguous tasks in AmbiK."

The eggs. chicken Can use the microwave to heat up water for the tea? Which type of eggs should the robot use for cracking into the blender? Example: task type preferences Table 14: Example of ambiguity_shortlist in AmbiK. Example: environment large mixing bowl, small mixing bowl, frying pan, grill pan, sauce pan, oven mitts, cabbage, cucumber, carrot, muesli, corntomato paste, flakes, mustard, ketchup Example: unambiguous_direct Kitchen Robot, please chop the cabbage, cucumber, and carrot into small pieces and place them in large mixing bowl. Example: ambiguous_task Kitchen Robot, please chop the cabbage, cucumber, and carrot into small pieces and place them in mixing bowl. Example: amb_shortlist large mixing bowl, small mixing bow 24 and 2 types of bowls in the environment. Such tasks can always be turned into single-ambiguity task by simply removing one ambiguity parameter. 4. question, answer: By following this structured approach, the pipeline can be seamlessly extended to new domains while maintaining consistency in task generation. select from the columns of the selected task type, check for adequacy, edit if necessary. Appendix Example outputs of different methods The question should be logical, that is, before the question, an ambiguous task should be incomprehensible to person (in the case of preferences) or the work is not very clear (in the case of safety and common sense knowledge), but after the question and receiving an answer to it, the task should be understandable to both person and robot. See Table 13 for examples. 6. amb_shortlist: Only for tasks of type PREFERENCES: set of objects between which ambiguity is eliminated. See Table 14 for examples. Write and check that the set consists of at least 2 objects. Thank you for helping! Appendix Applying the data generating pipeline to other domains The pipeline used for AmbiK generation (see Section 3.4) can be readily adapted to other domains by following the same procedure. All prompts and annotation guidelines are provided in the appendices above. For instance, to create similar dataset for household tasks in living room, the process would involve the following steps: 1. Object Categorization: Manually compile lists of objects grouped by semantic class (e.g., different types of chairs, electronic devices, etc.). 2. Unambiguous Task Generation: Sample environmental objects and use the prompts provided in Appendix to prompt an LLM to generate unambiguous tasks specific to each environment. 3. Ambiguous Task Generation: For each unambiguous task, generate ambiguous counterparts using type-specific prompts. 4. Human Annotation: Conduct manual annotations following the guidelines in Appendix to ensure data quality and consistency. In this section, we present examples of the final selected variants of KnowNo, LAP and LofreeCP methods. These were obtained through the application of Conformal Prediction to MCQA answers received from LLMs. All answers are compared on the same three pairs of tasks using GPT-3.5 + GPT-3.5 as the LLM. In the Plan sections, we provide plans for both ambiguous and unambiguous tasks. The variable parts of the plans are indicated within brackets. The text before the slash pertains to the ambiguous task, while the text after the slash pertains to the unambiguous task. It is important to emphasize that the examples provided are chosen at random and do not indicate the effectiveness or performance of the method.
