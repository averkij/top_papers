From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? 1. Introduction Recent progress in agentic reinforcement learning (RL) increasingly hinges on experience-driven scaling: as agents improve, further gains demand larger, more diverse, and more challenging environments (Tong et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a). Unlike static pretraining corpora, however, experience must be collected through interaction. As agents scale, this reliance exposes fundamental experience bottleneck: realistic environments are non-adaptive, difficult to scale, and limited in coverage, which become key limiting factors for progress in agentic RL (Guo et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025). key lever for alleviating this bottleneck is world modeling (Hafner et al., 2024, 2025; Hu et al., 2025a; Zhao et al., 2025). Effective learning from interaction requires agents to maintain internal models of the environment that track latent state, predict action outcomes, and learning beyond immediate observations. By internalizing environment dynamics and enabling learning from imagined interaction, world models help close the interaction loop and enable more efficient and effective learning. Meanwhile, LLM trained at massive scale via next-token prediction, exhibit strong generalization and encode rich world knowledge (Grattafiori et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2025b; Qwen et al., 2025). This naturally raises the question: Can large language models serve as effective world models, thereby improving agents to learn from experience? While prior work has explored LLMs as simulators, experience generators, or planning interfaces (Chen et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2025; He et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025), it remains unclear how to learn world model and when it is reliable enough to improve downstream agents. useful world model must go beyond locally plausible text, maintaining coherent state over time, remaining robust to distribution shift, and providing measurable utility. To address these questions in controlled setting, we focus on text-based environments as unifying interface between language modeling and world modeling. This abstraction preserves core challenges of agentic-environment interaction while reframing the objective from next-token prediction to next-state prediction under fixed interaction protocol. Through this lens, we formalize three-level framework for characterizing world modeling capabilities in agent learning. Fidelity and Consistency: Examine whether world model maintains coherent latent states over short and long horizons, forming the foundation for reliable world modeling. Scalability and Robustness: Characterize how world modeling capabilities scale and generalize under varying conditions, providing practical guidance for world model development. Agent Utility: Evaluate whether high-fidelity world models translate into measurable improvements for downstream agents. Studying five representative text-based environments, our analysis yields three main findings: (i) LLMs can function as reliable world models: they exhibit internal latent dynamics that support in-context world modeling, and supervised fine-tuning substantially improves short-term predictive fidelity and enables consistent long-horizon rollouts in well-structured domains. (ii) The development of reliable world models requires systematic scaling of model capacity and data volume with environment complexity, and maintaining robustness to distribution shift through broad behavioral coverage and diverse environment exposure. (iii) Fidelity world models provide practical benefits to agents by enabling verification of high-stakes actions to prevent irreversible failures, and by generating synthetic trajectories and warm-starting reinforcement learning to improve learning efficiency and effectiveness. 2 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? Taken together, these findings illuminate both the promise and the limits of LLM-based world models in text environments. From words to worlds, from next-token to next-state prediction, we provide an empirical foundation for treating LLMs as general-purpose world models for agentic learning and chart path toward domains beyond text. 2. Related Works Large language models have recently been explored as world models across variety of text-based and structured settings. Prior efforts in world modeling largely focus on predicting environment dynamics through structured or discrete state representations. Patch-based approaches prompt LLMs to estimate state deltas in ByteSized32 (Wang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), while in web navigation, systems such as WMA (Chae et al., 2025) and RLVR-World (Wu et al., 2025) reason over updates to the Accessibility Tree. Other lines of work adopt closed-form prediction schemes where the model outputs predefined symbolic labels or categories, including preconditions and effects in cooking environments (Xie et al., 2024), disaster impact ratings (Li et al., 2025a), or classifier-head predictions trained on LLM embeddings (Yang et al., 2025). Although these methods illustrate the utility of structured prediction for specific settings, they generally depend on environment-specific abstractions and fixed output space tailored to particular domains. In contrast, we formulate world modeling as multi-turn natural language simulation task, where the LLM generates next-state transitions in free text, enabling more general and compositional interaction patterns. Regarding model adaptation, much prior work employs zero-shot or few-shot prompting (Li et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Zuo et al., 2025) or attaches lightweight classifier heads for closed-form prediction (Yang et al., 2025). While such settings highlight the latent capabilities of LLMs, they often yield limited accuracy and constrains their applicability in downstream tasks. Moving beyond prompting-based adaptations, we finetune LLMs on large-scale multi-turn interaction trajectories to better internalize environment dynamics over extended horizons. Prior evaluation efforts largely center on single-step prediction accuracy in limited environments and domains (Chae et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) , and rarely examines long-horizon consistency or compounding errorsfactors that are critical for using world models as reliable simulators. Consequently, it remains an open question whether LLM-based world models can produce coherent multi-step trajectories that are executable in real environments. To address this gap, we conduct systematic evaluation across five representative environments, measuring not only one-step fidelity but also rollout stability, WM-to-Real transfer, and generalization across agents, environments, and scales. 3. LLM as Text-based World Models 3.1. Formalization of World Models We formalize the interaction between an agent and text-based world model as multi-turn language-based decision process, where both perception and action are represented in natural language. Agent text-based agent operates in ReAct style (Yao et al., 2023b), yielding simple, unified interface where each step involves internal reasoning and external action. Formally, the agent is defined as: : {𝑆0, (𝑇𝑖, 𝐴𝑖, 𝑆𝑖)𝑛 𝑖=1 } (𝑇𝑛, 𝐴𝑛), (1) 3 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? where 𝑆𝑖 denotes the textual observation (or environment response) at step 𝑖, 𝑇𝑖 represents the agents internal reasoning trace, and 𝐴𝑖 denotes the explicit action expressed in natural language. World Model The environment or its surrogate world model defines the complementary mapping: : {𝑆0, ( 𝐴𝑖, 𝑆 𝑖 )𝑛1 𝑖=1 , 𝐴𝑛} (𝑆 𝑛, 𝑅 𝑛), (2) 𝑛 denotes the next state predicted by the world model, and 𝑅 where 𝑆 𝑛 {0, 1} is binary reward indicating task success or termination. value of 𝑅 𝑛 = 1 corresponds to successful completion, while 𝑅 𝑛 = 0 denotes either an unfinished or failure state (e.g., triggering validation at the wrong time). Through these textual transitions, the world model functions as an implicit next-state predictor of environment dynamics. This capability can be realized through in-context learning, where the model leverages few-shot examples of state transitions in its prompt, or through supervised fine-tuning on trajectory data to learn the underlying dynamics. Note that in practice, text-based environments are inherently POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes): the true environment state is richer than what is described to the agent in text. For example, in ALFWorld room may contain objects and spatial details that are never mentioned (e.g., what is inside closed drawer), yet these hidden factors matter for predicting how the world evolves. Thus, although the agent only receives partial view of the initial state 𝑆0, the world model can be initialized with more complete context such as full environment configurations or randomized setups, allowing it to better approximate the latent dynamics of the environment. Interactive Process Together, the agent and world model form an iterative process: 𝑛, 𝑅 𝑆 𝑛 = (cid:0)A (𝑆0, (𝑇𝑖, 𝐴𝑖, 𝑆 𝑖=1 )(cid:1), 𝑖 )𝑛1 which unrolls into multi-turn textual trajectory generated within the world model: Correspondingly, the real environment produces the trajectory 𝜏wm = {𝑆0, 𝑇1, 𝐴1, 𝑆 1 , . . . , 𝑇𝑇 , 𝐴𝑇 , 𝑆 𝑇 }. 𝜏real = {𝑆0, 𝑇1, 𝐴1, 𝑆1, . . . , 𝑇𝑇 , 𝐴𝑇 , 𝑆𝑇 }, (3) (4) (5) which serves as the reference for evaluating the fidelity and consistency of W. By formulating text-based environments as multi-turn interactive processes, the world model can be prompted with few-shot examplars or trained on real trajectories 𝜏real to predict next-state transitions. This formulation enables to capture long-horizon dependencies and cumulative effects across interaction steps. While prior works (Wang et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025) primarily focus on next-state prediction accuracy, we explicitly model, train and evaluate the world models long-horizon consistency, which is critical for applications such as data synthesis, test-time simulator, and model-based reinforcement learning. 3.2. Text-based Environments To examine the range of knowledge and dynamics required for text-based world modeling in broad way, we adopt five representative environments spanning both structured and open-ended settings. The structured environments ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021), SciWorld (Wang et al., 4 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? 2022), and TextWorld (Côté et al., 2018) feature bounded state spaces. They provide deterministic or rule-governed transitions grounded in embodied, scientific, or narrative regularities. In contrast, the open-ended environments WebShop (Yao et al., 2023a) and StableToolBench (Guo et al., 2025) exhibit broad, compositional, and open-world dynamics, with diverse entities and flexible task formulations that require stronger generalization beyond fixed schemas. Table 5 in Appendix A.1 summarizes these environments and their key characteristics, with examples in Appendix B. Together, these settings provide comprehensive and diversified testbed for evaluating language models as text-based world simulators. 4. World Model Training and Evaluation We summarize the world model training and evaluation setup and defer full implementation details to Appendix A.1. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments follow the default settings described in this section. Data We collect interaction trajectories using GPT-4o as the behavior policy. To match environment complexity (see Section 6.1), we gather 40K trajectories each for ALFWorld, SciWorld, and TextWorld, and 70K for WebShop. We retain both successful and failed episodes to broaden behavioral coverage for world model training.1 For StableToolBench, we use the public single-turn dataset with 160K samples. Initialization Context For ALFWorld and SciWorld, the world model is provided with full initial state descriptions (see Figures 8 and 9 in Appendix A.4). In contrast, TextWorld does not expose complete initial states, and WebShop/StableToolBench are inherently partially observable. This setting places greater demands on history-based state tracking and prior knowledge to infer unobserved state variables. Finetuning Models We use Qwen2.5-7B (base) and Llama-3.1-8B (base) as backbone models for text-based world modeling. comparison across different model sizes is provided in Section 6.2. Training Each trajectory is formatted as multi-turn dialogue of alternating agent actions and environment responses (see Eq. 5). During supervised fine-tuning, the world model predicts the next environment response conditioned on the dialogue history and the current action. , 𝐴𝑛} and predicting the next state and reward (𝑆 Metrics We evaluate world models along two dimensions: one-step prediction fidelity and multi-step rollout consistency. Fidelity. We compute exact-match (EM) accuracy by conditioning on real trajectory prefix {𝑆0, ( 𝐴𝑖, 𝑆𝑖)𝑛1 𝑛). prediction 𝑖=1 is correct if (𝑆 𝑛, 𝑅 𝑛) matches the ground-truth (𝑆𝑛, 𝑅𝑛). For TextWorld, EM is conservative lower bound since multiple surface forms can describe the same underlying state. For StableToolBench, whose outputs are highly open-ended, we additionally report word-level F1. Consistency. We report: (1) Real: success rate in the real environment; (2) WM: success rate inside the world model; (3) W2R: success rate when replaying WM actions in the real environment; and (4) Consistency Ratio: CR = W2R/Real, where higher values indicate better long-horizon transfer (CR may exceed 1 when world model rollouts are more successful than real world). 𝑛, 𝑅 1The success/failure mixture is induced by GPT-4os native success rate without additional filtering. 5 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?"

STBF1 denotes the word-level F1 score for StableToolBench, given its open-ended output space. 5. Fidelity & Consistency 5.1. Next-state Prediction Fidelity Table 1 demonstrates that pretrained LLMs exhibit meaningful in-context world modeling ability. Models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and Claude-sonnet-4.5 achieve strong next-state prediction in structured environments like ALFWorld and SciWorld, where handful of demonstrations provides substantial improvements (e.g., Claude rises from 56.83 to 73.08 accuracy on SciWorld with only three examples). This suggests that contemporary LLMs encode latent knowledge of environment dynamics and can rapidly adapt their transition rules with minimal supervision. However, these capabilities do not fully transfer to open-ended settings such as WebShop, where few-shot prompting plateaus around mid-50s, indicating that implicit world knowledge alone is insufficient for generating unconstrained, context-dependent state updates. Supervised fine-tuning yields substantial improvements. Open-source models trained directly on transition trajectories achieve 99%/98% accuracy on ALFWorld and SciWorld and reach 49% F1 on StableToolBench. These results indicate that robust world modeling requires dynamics-aligned training: prompting alone cannot capture the full diversity of transition patterns, whereas supervised fine-tuning enables even relatively small models to internalize them effectively. Findings 1: [Short-term Fidelity] LLMs exhibit internal latent dynamics that support in-context world modeling, while high-fidelity transition modeling depends on dynamics-aligned fine-tuning.

Real, WM, and W2R denote the success rate under real environment, world model, and world model-to-real execution. The last column reports the consistency ratio (CR=W2R/Real), with higher values (darker green color) indicating better rollout fidelity. 5.2. Rollout Consistency reliable world model requires not only high single-step prediction accuracy, but more critically, the ability to maintain consistency during extended interactions with agents. We examine two key dimensions: (1) whether small local errors compound into significant failures over long-horizon rollouts, and (2) whether the world model generalizes across different agent behaviors beyond its training distribution. Table 2 reports consistency metrics across four environments and multiple agents; StableToolBench is omitted due to its single-turn nature. Consistency Across Environments World models largely preserve single-step fidelity in longhorizon rollouts, especially in structured environments. In ALFWorld, SciWorld, and TextWorld, the fine-tuned Qwen2.5 world model attains high consistency ratios of 96%, 91%, and 92%, indicating that multi-step trajectories generated within the world model remain executable when transferred to the real environment. WebShop, however, exhibits lower consistency (typically below 80%), primarily due to its open-ended nature and diverse search results that the world model struggles to simulate accurately. This error can be substantially mitigated by grounding model rollouts with real observations. When the rollout is initialized with real search results, the consistency with GPT-4o agent increases dramatically from 56% to nearly 100%, demonstrating that partial real-environment anchoring effectively reduces simulation drift. Findings 2: [Long-term Consistency] World models maintain consistent long-horizon rollouts in well-structured domains, but tend to drift in open-ended environments due to high diversity, necessitating anchoring to real-world signals. How does behavior shift affect consistency? Beyond environment-specific factors, world model consistency also depends on how well agent behaviors match the training distribution. Lower-capacity agents such as GPT-4o-mini yield consistency ratios frequently below 70%, whereas stronger agents 7 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?

Smaller models (1.5B) capture structured dynamics effectively, whereas more complex settings benefit markedly from increased model capacity. like GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Claude reliably exceed 90%. This disparity stems from weaker agents taking actions misaligned with task objectives, causing their trajectories to drift outside the training distribution. In contrast, higher-capacity agents preserve goal-directed behavior that aligns with the expert policy (GPT-4o) used for trajectories sampling, enabling higher consistency. These results highlight the importance of diversifying training trajectories rather than relying solely on single strong agent, as further discussed in Section 6.5. 6. Scalability & Robustness 6.1. Data Scaling Laws for World Models To investigate how world model performance scales with data, we vary training trajectories from 1K to 160K and evaluate single-step accuracy. As shown in Figure 2, structured environments (ALFWorld, SciWorld, TextWorld) improve rapidly and saturate around 20K trajectories, consistent with their low-entropy, rule-driven dynamics. In contrast, open-ended environments scale more gradually: WebShop benefits from additional data up to roughly 70K trajectories, while StableToolBench shows no saturation at 160K samples due to long-tail linguistic variation and highly compositional API behaviors. These results indicate that world modeling exhibits environment-dependent scaling: structured environments are highly data-efficient, whereas open-ended domains require substantially larger datasets. 6.2. Model Size Effects We next analyze how model capacity shapes world model performance (Figure 3). Mirroring datascaling trends, model size interacts strongly with environment complexity. In structured environments, performance saturates quickly: 1.5B models already capture core transition dynamics, with further 8 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? Figure 4 Task success rate (%) in ALFWorld under different OOD settings. Success rate averaged over different agents, with full results provided in Table 10 of Appendix C. World models maintain strong performance even when layouts or room types change. scaling yielding only marginal improvements. In open-ended environments, however, capacity matters substantially. Smaller models struggle to represent rich linguistic variability and compositional tool usage, whereas larger models offer steady accuracy gains. Together with the data-scaling results, these findings indicate that success in open-ended world modeling requires both extensive trajectories and sufficient model capacity to internalize long-tailed, high-entropy dynamics. Findings 3: [LLMs are Scalable World Models] World modeling performance scales systematically with data volume, model size and environment complexity. 6.3. Beyond Memorized Environments central question in world model design is how well they generalize across unseen settings. Using ALFWorld as representative case, we analyze two out-of-distribution test splits following the original environment settings (Shridhar et al., 2021): OOD-Seen, which keeps the room type but alters the layout, and OOD-Unseen, which introduces entirely new room types or unseen layout configurations. As shown in Figure 4, the world models maintain success rates closely aligned with the real environment across both OOD settings even when the spatial configuration shifts or novel room types appear. These results indicate that the LLM world model captures transferable transition dynamics rather than memorizing specific layouts, demonstrating strong robustness to structural variations in environment state space. 6.4. Cross-Env Transfer via Joint Training Training world models in isolation often limits their ability to generalize beyond single environment, motivating us to investigate whether jointly training on multiple environments can yield transferable gains. We therefore evaluate three mixed-training configurations: Mix3 (ALFWorld, SciWorld, TextWorld), Mix4 (with WebShop), and Mix5 (with StableToolBench), allocating 1K trajectories per environment to match the data budget of individually trained models. As shown in Figure 5, mixed training consistently accelerates learning and improves final accuracy, with particularly strong gains in TextWorld and WebShop, suggesting that the model effectively internalizes and reuses shared physical, procedural, and narrative dynamics across tasks. The exception is StableToolBench, whose schema-centric, single-turn structure is underrepresented in the mixture, causing separately trained model to outperform. Overall, these results show that mixed data provides stable positive gains and, importantly, enables practical deployments where single world model can robustly serve multiple environments.

Figure 5 Next-state prediction accuracy under mixed and separate training on Qwen2.5-7B, with 1K samples per environment. We begin by mixing structured environments (ALFWorld, SciWorld, TextWorld) and then progressively incorporate open-ended environments (WebShop, StableToolBench), yielding the Mix3, Mix4, and Mix5 settings."

Behavioral Coverage for Robust World Modeling As behavior shifts reduce consistency, we ask whether broader behavioral coverage improves generalization. We train world model on mixed-agent trajectories and compare it to GPT-4o-only baseline. Table 3 shows marked OOD gains for weaker agents: GPT-4o-minis consistency ratio rises from 0.49 to 0.81, and GPT-4-turbo also improves. This indicates that expert-only trajectories are insufficient under distribution shift; incorporating diverse agent behaviors is crucial for improving generalization and rollout stability. Findings 4: [World Models Learn Generalizable Dynamics] World models generalize beyond memorized configurations and transfer across environments and agent policies, where coverage of environments and diversity of agent behaviors play critical roles. 7. Agent Utility 7.1. Can World Models Prevent Irreversible Mistakes? In real-world decision-making, some actions are irreversible and costly, creating safety bottleneck: single mistaken commitment can end an episode or cause unrecoverable loss. This motivates using world models as rewindable imagined world to evaluate high-stakes actions before execution. WebShop exemplifies this setting: once the agent checks out, the episode ends and errors cannot be 10 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?"

The numbers in parentheses indicate the improvement over the baseline without verification. undone. We therefore use the world model as lightweight pre-execution verifier. Before committing to checkout, the agent simulates the outcome; it executes the action only when the prediction indicates success, otherwise it continues interacting with the environment. We vary the verification budget (0, 2, 4, 10, 50). As shown in Table 4, verification improves success rates for all agents, with the largest gains for medium-capacity models. However, returns are not monotonic, since repeated verification changes the trajectory context and shifts the agents action distribution, inducing distribution shift that can weaken alignment between imagined and real outcomes. In practice, moderate budgets (e.g., 210 checks) provide the best trade-off, reducing irreversible failures without destabilizing behavior. Findings 5: [As Rewindable Safety Verifier] By simulating irreversible actions and gating execution on predicted success, world models help agents avoid costly commitments and achieve higher task success. 7.2. Synthetic Data Competes with Real When real interaction is expensive, slow, or constrained, agents face an experience bottleneck. world model can potentially alleviate this bottleneck by synthesizing trajectories that substitute for portion of real experience. To examine this, we collect 1,000 successful trajectories from either the real environment or the world model2, and construct four SFT datasets for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct: Real 1K, Syn 1K, 0.5K+0.5K, and 1K+1K mixture, all trained under identical procedures. Figure 6 shows that world modelgenerated trajectories are highly competitive with real data. In SciWorld, Syn 1K matches Real 1K, while the 1K+1K mixture outperforms either source alone. In WebShop, synthetic data remains similarly effective, and mixed regimes yield the most stable gains. Overall, these results suggest that synthetic experience can reduce reliance on real-environment interaction, providing an alternative pathway for scaling agent learning when real experience is limited. 7.3. Early Experience for Policy Learning Recent work (Zhang et al., 2025b) suggests that exposing model to environment dynamics before explicit policy learning can provide useful inductive bias: anticipating consequences may reduce unguided exploration and stabilize early RL. To study this in our text-based decision environments, we compare (1) standard Agent-SFT RL baseline; and (2) world-model warmup pipeline (WM-SFT Agent-SFT RL), where the agent is first exposed to environment dynamics with same objective 2Implementation details in Appendix A. 11 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? Figure 6 Task success rate (%) of Qwen2.5-7BInstruct SFT trained agents with different data synthesis strategies in SciWorld and WebShop. Figure 7 Task success rate (%) of Qwen2.5-7BInstruct RL trained agents with and without early experience in ALFWorld and SciWorld. as world model training3. Figure 7 indicates that early experience delivers consistent gains on both ALFWorld and SciWorld. By exposing the agent to environment dynamics before policy learning, early experience stabilizes RL training, reducing failures driven by incorrect commonsense priors, and ultimately yields higher final success rates than the baseline. Overall, early experience provides promising direction for improving learning effectiveness. Findings 6: [Learning from World-Model Dynamics] By providing both scalable supervision and early dynamics exposure, world models reduce reliance on real interaction and improve learning efficiency, enabling agents to learn more effectively from experience. 8. Conclusion This work set out to investigate simple yet far-reaching question: can the paradigm that enables large language models to model words also enable them to model worlds, and in turn support more effective agent learning from experience? Using text-based environments as controlled testbed, we recast world modeling as multi-turn next-state prediction under interaction, and introduce systematic framework for evaluating fidelity, scalability, and agent utility. Our results provide strong evidence that LLMs can serve as implicit text-based world models. When trained with dynamics-aligned supervision at sufficient scale and coverage, they maintain coherent latent state over extended horizons and yield tangible benefits for downstream agents, including safer decision making, scalable experience generation, and improved learning efficiency. At the same time, these gains are not universal: robustness depends critically on behavioral coverage, distributional alignment, and environment complexity, delineating concrete regimes in which world modeling meaningfully supports agent learning. Taken together, these findings establish an empirical foundation for treating LLMs not merely as sequence predictors, but as learned simulators of interactive worlds. By bridging next-token prediction with next-state modeling, this work points toward unifying view of language models as world models for agentsand opens the door to extending these ideas beyond text to richer, multimodal, and embodied domains. 3Implementation details in Appendix A. 12 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?"

Task examples are provided in Figures 1418 in Appendix B. Data Sources and Sizes For ALFWorld, SciWorld and WebShop, we follow the data splits provided in AgentGym4 (Xi et al., 2024). For TextWorld, we follow the official TextWorld repository5 to generate game files and randomly split into 2.5K training games and 200 test games. For StableToolBench, 4https://github.com/WooooDyy/AgentGym 5https://github.com/microsoft/TextWorld 17 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? we filtered the StableToolBench MirrorAPI dataset6 and remove samples with errors or incomplete information, and use 160K API pairs for training and 2K pairs for testing. The data sizes for different environments are summarized in Table 6. Trajectories Collection We utilize the AgentGym (Xi et al., 2024) framework to collect long-horizon interaction trajectories using GPT-4o as the agent across four interactive environments: ALFWorld, SciWorld, TextWorld, and WebShop. We maintain consistent system prompts (Appendix D), interaction protocols, environment configurations as in AgentGym. The sampling temperature is set to 1.0 with Top-p of 1.0, and maximum of 50 interaction turns per trajectory. System prompts used for trajectory collection are provided in Figure 19 to 23. Ultimately, we collect 40K trajectories each for ALFWorld, SciWorld, and TextWorld, and 70K trajectories for WebShop on their respective training sets, as summarized in Table 6."

A.2. Synthetic Data Competes with Real To compare the quality of world-modelsynthesized trajectories with those from the real environment, we construct matched SFT datasets using 1,000 successful trajectories collected from (i) the real environment and (ii) the world model. To control for the behavior policy used during data collection, both datasets are generated by the same agent: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct policy trained via direct RL (i.e., without any SFT). This design avoids reusing the world-model training policy (GPT-4o) as the collector, thereby reducing the risk that the world model self-replays trajectories through the behavior policy. For world-model rollouts, trajectory success is determined by the models own predicted outcome. A.3. Early Experience for Policy Learning Early Experience (WM-SFT) To provide early dynamics exposure before policy learning, we warmstart the agent with world-model style supervised objective (Eq. 2): predicting the next environment response and termination signal conditioned on the dialogue history and the current action. We use the same data sources described in Appendix A.1 and sample 1,000 trajectories to construct the WM-SFT dataset. Training follows the same SFT hyper-parameters as world model training  (Table 7)  . For the baseline without early experience, this stage is skipped. Agent Warmup (Agent-SFT) After WM-SFT, we perform standard policy warmup stage by supervised fine-tuning on real-environment trajectories collected in Appendix A.1. Specifically, we sample 1,000 trajectories and fine-tune the agent to generate its next turn (reasoning trace and action; Eq. 1) from the interaction history. We use the same SFT hyper-parameters as in Table 7. 19 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? Reinforcement Learning (Agent-RL) We utilize the AgentGymRL framework8 (Xi et al., 2025) to run GRPO training for agent policy training, with the suggested hyper-parameters as suggested in the paper.

World Model Initialization Context In ALFWorld and SciWorld, each game instance involves random initialization of the environment. For example, in ALFWorld, the positions and contents of objects within rooms vary, while in SciWorld, the connectivity of houses changes with each initialization. Consequently, even for humans, accurately predicting the next state of the environment based solely on task descriptions is challenging. Similar to RAWM (Yang et al., 2025), we include the initial state information of the environment for the world models predictions. This design aligns with practical applications where the world model is used with knowledge of the initial environment state. In data synthesis scenarios, such random states can be sampled through similar random generation methods, enhancing the diversity and generalization capabilities of the world model. Examples of initial state information are provided in Figure 8 and 9. While TextWorld lacks full initial state information due to environment limits. WebShop and StableToolBench are inherently open environments where comprehensive initial state information cannot be provided, so they also do not include initial state information. 8https://github.com/WooooDyy/AgentGym-RL From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? # Environment Information (Only visible to Assistant) === Objects on Receptacles === - cabinet 1 is closed, if opened, in it, you see nothing. - cabinet 2 is closed, if opened, on the cabinet 2, you see dishsponge 1 - cabinet 3 is closed, if opened, on the cabinet 3, you see mug 1 - cabinet 4 is closed, if opened, in it, you see nothing. - cabinet 5 is closed, if opened, on the cabinet 5, you see soapbottle 3 - cabinet 6 is closed, if opened, on the cabinet 6, you see plate 1 - On the cabinet 9, you see mug 3 - On the countertop 1, you see bread 1, dishsponge 3, egg 2, fork 2, mug 2, pen 2, peppershaker 1, potato 1, potato 2, winebottle 2, winebottle 3 - On the diningtable 1, you see apple 1, bowl 1, bowl 2, butterknife 1, butterknife 2, butterknife 3, fork 1, glassbottle 1, glassbottle 2, knife 1, knife 2, lettuce 1, pen 1, pot 1, saltshaker 1, saltshaker 2, soapbottle 1, soapbottle 2, spatula 1, spatula 2, winebottle 1 - drawer 2 is closed, if opened, on the drawer 2, you see dishsponge 2, pencil 1 - fridge 1 is closed, if opened, on the fridge 1, you see bowl 3, cup 1, lettuce 2, tomato 1 - On the garbagecan 1, you see apple 2, egg 1 - microwave 1 is closed, if opened, on the microwave 1, you see apple 3 - On the sinkbasin 1, you see glassbottle 3, spoon 1 - On the stoveburner 1, you see pan 1 - On the stoveburner 3, you see pan 2 - On the stoveburner 4, you see pan 2 # User Environment Information (Displayed to User) You are in the middle of room.

Figure 22 Agent System Prompt for TextWorld Trajectory Collection 34 From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models? Imagine you are an API Server operating within specialized tool, which contains collection of distinct APIs. Your role is to deeply understand the function of each API based on their descriptions in the API documentation. As you receive specific inputs for individual API calls within this tool, analyze these inputs to determine their intended purpose. Your task is to craft JSON formatted response that aligns with the expected output of the API. The JSON scheme is: { \"error\": \"\", \"response\": \"\" } The error field should remain empty, indicating no errors in processing. The response field should contain the content you formulate based on the APIs functionality and the input provided. Ensure that your responses are meaningful, directly addressing the APIs intended functionality. The key is to maintain the JSON formats integrity while ensuring that your response is an accurate reflection of the APIs intended output within the tool. Please note that your answer should not contain anything other than json format object, which should be parsable directly to json. Note that: - your response should contain rich information given the api input parameters. - your response must be effective and have practical content. API calls may fail for various reasons, such as invalid input parameters, authentication issues, or server errors. Your goal is to generate response that accurately reflects the APIs intended functionality, even if the input parameters are incorrect. Your response should be informative and relevant to the APIs purpose, providing clear and concise explanation of the expected output based on the input provided. Here is an example: API doc: { \"api_name\": \"List Languages\", \"api_description\": \"Get list of currently supported languages. We are constantly adding more every few weeks.\", \"required_parameters\": [], \"optional_parameters\": [], \"tool_description\": \"Introducing our cutting-edge text to speech service, designed to provide you with the most realistic human-sounding voices at an affordable price.
