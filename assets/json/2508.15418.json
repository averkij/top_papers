In the visual domain, this has led to the rapid maturation of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), *Corresponding Author 1This research is supported by EIT-NLP Lab and Logic Intelligence Technology.

For each task, scores are normalized by setting the best-performing models result to 1. Details are in Table 13. where established paradigms, such as leveraging CLIP-style encoders (Radford et al., 2021), have enabled effective and scalable alignment between vision and text (Awadalla et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025; Cocchi et al., 2025). In contrast, the development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) remains in more nascent and fragmented stage. The field currently lacks consensus on fundamental architectural principles, with competing approaches that include external feature fusion (Radford et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b), dedicated cross-modal attention mechanisms (Kong et al., 2024a; Elizalde et al., 2024), and implicit alignment strategies (Chu et al., 2024). This architectural divergence is compounded by lack of transparency in existing research. While several open-source LSLM initiatives have emerged (Chu et al., 2023; DÃ©fossez et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024), many are only partially open. Model weights may be released, but the underlying training data and crucial configurations are often withheld. This opacity makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons, as performance differences can be attributed as much to proprietary data or undisclosed training strategies as to architectural merit, hindering systematic progress. resources, we aim to lower the barrier to entry and foster new wave of systematic, community-driven progress in large-scale speech-language modeling. To address these challenges of fragmentation and opacity, we introduce LLaSO: fully open, end-toend framework designed to establish foundational standards for LSLM research. LLaSO consists of three core, publicly available components: 1. LLaSO-Align: 12M-instance speechtext alignment corpus aggregated from diverse sources, including conversational read narraspeech (Chen et al., 2021), tives (Panayotov et al., 2015), audio books (Ito and Johnson, 2017; Pratap et al., 2020), and accented speech (Veaux et al., 2016). 2. LLaSO-Instruct: 13.5M-instance instruction-tuning dataset covering 20 tasks across linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic domains. It supports three distinct modality configurations: audio instructions with audio inputs, textual instructions with audio inputs, and audio instructions with textual inputs. 3. LLaSO-Eval: reproducible benchmark of 15,044 stratified samples designed for comprehensive evaluation of instruction-following capabilities of LSLMs. To validate our framework and provide the community with strong, reproducible baseline, we developed LLaSO-Base, 3.8B-parameter reference model that adapts the successful LLaVA architecture to the speech domain. Trained exclusively on LLaSO-Align and LLaSO-Instruct, and evaluated on LLaSO-Eval, our model achieves normalized score of 0.72, outperforming the next best comparable model (0.65). As illustrated in Figures 1 and 8, LLaSO-Base is designed not for state-of-the-art performance, but to demonstrate the power of an open, extensible, and reproducible workflow. Our evaluation shows that while broader training improves overall performance, models still struggle with generalization, leaving substantial gaps on unseen tasks and pure audio settings. Investigating potential solutions for this weakness, we found that models equipped with interleaving and parallel decoding mechanisms exhibit far greater robustness in these challenging scenarios. In summary, LLaSO provides the first fully open, end-to-end stack for LSLM research, comprising large-scale training datasets, standardized benchmark, and reference model. By releasing these"

            "content": "Vision-Language Modeling. Vision-language modeling has rapidly advanced through standardized two-stage paradigm: modality alignment followed by instruction tuning (Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023c). The rapid progress in this field has been facilitated by two essential types of open resources. First, public training datasets and standardized evaluation benchmarks (Ma et al., 2023; Hsieh et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024b; Fu et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025) have become widely adopted, enabling fair comparison and transparent reproducibility across models and tasks. Second, open-source implementations with modular codebases such as LLaVA (Lin et al., 2023) and OpenFlamingo (Awadalla et al., 2023) have significantly lowered the technical barriers to development and fostered rapid iteration across the community. Together, these practices have fostered shared research infrastructure where new models and tasks are often built upon existing resources (Liu et al., 2023a; Yin et al., 2024). This has allowed vision-language research to focus more on advancing scientific capabilities rather than reimplementing foundational components. Speech-Language Modeling. Compared to vision-language modeling, progress in speechlanguage systems has been less cohesive (Su et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2024). First, most leading models such as Audio Flamingo (Kong et al., 2024b; Ghosh et al., 2025), Qwen-Audio (Chu et al., 2023, 2024), and Kimi-Audio (KimiTeam et al., 2025) rely on proprietary data, limiting reproducibility (Peng et al., 2025; Pandey et al., 2025). Second, most models support only narrow modality configurations (e.g., text-plus-audio), with few (Tang addressing more compositional et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). Third, existing datasets largely focus on semantic reasoning (Fang et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024; Mei et al., 2024), with limited coverage of prosody and emotion. Lastly, few open-source stacks unify models, datasets, and benchmarks; most systems (e.g., LauraGPT (Du et al., 2023), Moshi (DÃ©fossez et al., 2024), Westlake-Omni (Xinchen-ai, 2024)) lack full releases, hindering reproducibility and community development. tasks"

Audio Type refers to whether the dataset is comprised of real recordings (Collected), synthetic data, or both (Mixed). / indicate the presence or absence of released alignment data. LLaSO-Eval: stratified benchmark designed for consistent evaluation across tasks. These components together support the full training pipeline of LSLMs, modality alignment, instruction tuning, and evaluation (see Figure 2). To advance LSLMs beyond vision-language paradigms, we anchor our benchmark design in two core properties of speech: Inherent Paralinguistics: Speech conveys rich, essential information beyond words such as speaker identity, accent, emotion, and prosody. These paralinguistic cues are omnipresent and crucial for natural human communication. Flexible Modality Roles: In LSLMs, both audio and text can serve as inputs or instructions, enabling diverse interaction patterns e.g., audio-instruction with text input, text-instruction with audio input, or audioinstruction with audio input. To better reflect the needs of real-world systems, we adopt balanced task weighting approach that corrects for limitations in existing corpora: Semantic Tasks (8%): Intentionally underweighted, as their success often reflects language modeling capacity rather than speech understanding (Rouditchenko et al., 2025), and they are already well-represented (Gong et al., 2023b; Fang et al., 2025). Paralinguistic Tasks (40%): Prioritized to address their underrepresentation in current resources (Jiang et al., 2025; yu Huang et al., 2024). We ensure diversity by combining realworld metadata with synthetically generated variations. Figure 2: Overview of LLaSO Corpus, comprising LLaSOAlign, LLaSO-Instruct, and LLaSO-Eval. It encompasses 25.5M audio-text pairs spanning 20 task types, including 18 paralinguistic tasks, and supports linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic abilities. Instances include both real (73%) and synthetic (27%) audio, covering multiple input combinations and tasks. Further statistics are detailed in Table 12."

LLaSO-Instruct: multi-task instructiontuning dataset spanning linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic tasks. 3 Figure 3: LLaSO Corpus construction pipeline. We first aggregate heterogeneous sources, including text-based QA corpora and speech datasets covering acoustic, paralinguistic, and semantic tasks, then normalize format, sample rate, and instruction style, etc. We construct LLaSO-Align (12.0 M) for aligning speech and text modality via ASR, while LLaSO-Instruct (13.5 M) for multi-task instruction tuning including classification, recognition, and AQA. When synthesize audio, we use vocal style mixing strategy as Figure 4 by utilizing controllable TTS and voice-cloning for richer speaker variation, enabling pure-audio, text plus audio, and audio plus text formatted samples with diverse gender, accent, speed, and tone. Linguistic Tasks (52%): Dominated by ASR, which remains foundational to grounding speech in linguistic structure and is critical for general performance. The final LLaSO Corpus includes 71% realworld audio and 29% synthetic speech, and covers broad range of modality configurations where both audio and text flexibly act as inputs and instructions (see Table 1). This design ensures robust coverage of the full speech landscape, supporting the development of unified and adaptable LSLMs."

            "content": "To establish robust semantic foundation for speech-language modeling, we adopt ASR as the core alignment task in LLaSO Corpuss first stage. Following vision-language best practices, this approach grounds speech representations directly in textual semantic space through explicit instructionresponse pairing. LLaSO-Align contains 12M instruction-formatted ASR samples, each consisting of an audio input, natural language instruction, and reference transcription. Unlike traditional ASR datasets that offer only raw audio-text pairs, we introduce 18 manually designed instruction templates that frame the task with varying specificity and constraints. These include prompts such as Transcribe the audio precisely. Return only the text with no added commentary, encouraging models to attend more carefully to instructions and simulate real-world usage scenarios. To ensure diversity in content and speaker profiles, we collect data from wide range of public ASR corpora, including conversational speech (Chen et al., 2021), single-speaker narration (Panayotov et al., 2015), audio books (Ito and Johnson, 2017; Pratap et al., 2020), and accented English (Veaux et al., 2016). This allows the corpus to capture broad distribution of acoustic environments, accents, age groups, and speech styles. All samples undergo standardized preprocessing pipeline to ensure consistency and quality (see Figure 3). Corrupted or unreadable files are removed, and valid audio is resampled to 16 kHz and converted to WAV or FLAC format. Transcriptions are filtered to retain only English content with standard characters, then normalized to follow conventional grammar and formatting (e.g., proper capitalization, spacing). Each cleaned sample is paired with randomly selected instruction template, and the final dataset is packaged in unified JSON format. By reframing ASR as an instruction-following alignment task and curating diverse, high-quality dataset, LLaSO-Align lays the groundwork for downstream speech-language understanding across modalities."

            "content": "Building on the aligned speech-text representations from LLaSO-Align, we present LLaSO-Instruct, 4 multi-task instruction tuning dataset designed to advance speech-language modeling with greater task diversity and richer modality configurations. Unlike previous instruction datasets that focus primarily on semantic tasks with limited input modalities, LLaSO-Instruct fully embraces the inherently multimodal and paralinguistic nature of speech. It systematically expands both the scope of tasks and the variety of modality pairings, offering comprehensive framework for training instruction-following speech-language models. Figure 4: Overview of the Vocal Style Mixing. Vocal style mixing is strategy in our data construction pipeline in Figure 3, where utterances are systematically synthesized with diverse speaker traits. This strategy is applied across all three modalities input, expanding acoustic diversity and simulating realistic multi-speaker scenarios, resulting wide range of speech-language interactions in Figure 5. Task Coverage. LLaSO-Instruct spans 20 tasks grouped into three categories: linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic. While linguistic tasks (e.g., ASR) and semantic tasks (e.g., audio-based QA) cover foundational capabilities, the majority of tasks are paralinguistic, designed to capture speaker traits and contextual acoustic cues crucial for socially-aware interaction. These include speaker-centric tasks such as emotion or accent recognition, and content-centric tasks such as phoneme or intent classification. We present the statistics of all included tasks in Appendix L. To construct this wide range of tasks, firstly, we collect task-specific datasets with rich metadata, enabling the same audio sample to be repurposed for multiple tasks using associated labels such as gender, accent, and age. When label distributions are imbalanced, we implement targeted sampling strategies such as downsampling overrepresented classes or trimming the extremes of long-tail distributions. 2 Secondly, for each task we manually construct 20 text instructions spanning four prompt styles including standardized, contextualized, stylistic variation, and fine-grained task prompts. Representative examples are provided in Appendix H. For ASR and AQA, all instructions are open-ended, inviting free-form responses from the model. In contrast, paralinguistic tasks predominantly employ closed-ended instructions, where the model must select an answer from predefined list without additional analysis. To address diverse task requirements, we construct training samples at multiple levels of granularity, so that some paralinguistic tasks also include open-ended variants. 3 We display task prototypes in Figure 5II and the open/closed-ended mapping in Table 12. As to linguistic and semantic task categories, we will discuss in the following paragraph. Modality Coverage. To reflect speechs flexible role as both input and instruction, LLaSO-Instruct supports three core modality configurations: 1. Text instruction with audio input 2. Audio instruction with text input 3. Pure audio for both instruction and input An overview is provided in Table L. Linguistic tasks retain their native modality pairings, with one million ASR samples carried over 2For example, in the Meld accent dataset, we address the pronounced long-tail in accent labels by removing the rarest and trimming the most dominant classes. Similarly, while VCTK was originally introduced for ASR, we repurpose its gender metadata for speaker gender classification; given that its gender labels are imbalanced (approximately 20K female versus 15K male samples), we downsample the female subset to achieve balanced 1:1 ratio. 3For example, in age classification, we provide three levels: coarse-grained (e.g., twenties, fifties, sixties10-year spans), medium-grained (e.g., 15-19, 20-24, 25-295year spans), and fine-grained where the model is required to predict the exact age as an integer between 18 and 80. from LLaSO-Align. Semantic QA tasks are derived from high-quality textual instruction datasets (e.g., OpenOrca and Alpaca) and converted into multimodal samples using advanced audio synthesis (see Figure 4). Each instance may yield multiple variants (e.g., text-with-audio and audio-with-text) to support robust cross-modal learning. 4 Paralinguistic tasks are primarily configured as text-instruction with audio input, but where feasible, we also construct fully speech-driven formats by synthesizing both instruction and input as audio. This enables training in pure audio scenarios that better simulate human-human interaction. Overall, LLaSO-Instruct provides rich, flexible instruction-tuning corpus that strengthens speechlanguage models across wide range of semantic and paralinguistic tasks while supporting diverse modality combinations."

            "content": "To complete our data trio, we introduce LLaSOEval, held-out evaluation suite designed to accompany the LLaSO training set. Derived from the same underlying corpus but strictly separated from the training split, LLaSO-Eval supports comprehensive model assessment across diverse set of speech understanding tasks. LLaSO-Eval consists of 15,044 evaluation samples spanning 20 tasks, which are grouped into three broad categories: linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic. It fully supports the three major modality configurations and is designed to test both withinand cross-modal generalization. Table 2 provides detailed breakdown of the task types, categories, and modality distributions. From task perspective, LLaSO-Eval enables comprehensive evaluation of model capabilities across three major categories: linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic tasks. Within the paralinguistic category, we further distinguish between speaker-centric tasks such as gender, age, and accent classification and content-centric tasks like intent prediction, phoneme recognition, and entity extraction. This distinction enables fine-grained analysis of how models handle both speaker identity and acoustic-semantic information. 4When instruction and input segments are suitable for audio synthesis, English-only, properly normalized, nonduplicated, excluding special tags (e.g., <img>, base64), and sufficiently long for error-free synthesis, each textual QA instance yields both text-with-audio and audio-with-text variants. (I) Interaction formats supported in LLaSO Corpus. (II) Task prototypes. (a) closed-set classification; (b) multigranularity/open-set recognition; (c) open-ended AQA. Figure 5: Qualitative overview of the formats and task categories covered by LLaSO Corpus. Panel (I) visualises the three instruction-input configurations supported end-to-end; panel (II) illustrates the three task prototypes. Those compositional flexibilities are absent from previous speech-language datasets that are mainly restricted to single instruction-input patterns. These examples also serve as case-study references in Section 5.5. We present text instructions style and granularity details in Appendix and I. From modality perspective, LLaSO-Eval not only evaluates model performance on modality configurations seen during training, but also stresses cross-modal generalization, testing the models robustness to novel input-output combinations. To evaluate instruction-following capabilities, LLaSO-Eval includes both open-ended and closedended prompts. Open-ended tasks test models ability to engage in free-form comprehension and reasoning, while closed-ended tasks, especially common in the paralinguistic category, require strict selection from predefined label sets. This allows for quantitative measurement of instruction adherence through metrics such as abstention rate."

This straightforward yet empirically validated structure mirrors successful visionlanguage instruction tuning paradigms, so we refer to and verify whether this architecture is still applicable in speech domain, despite its various modality configurations. We choose Whisper-large-v3 (Radford et al., 2022) as our speech encoder, as its rich intermediate semantic representation and strong consensus in community (Zhang et al., 2024; Gong et al., 2023a). And we retain only its encoder component, comprising two convolutional downsampling layers followed by 32 Transformer blocks, approximately 640M parameters. During preprocessing, audio is resampled to 16kHz, then converted into 128-channel mel spectrograms using 25ms window and 10ms hop length. In addition, pooling layer with stride 2 reduces the audio representation length. As result, each encoded frame approximately corresponds to 40ms segment of the original audio. SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019) is applied during training to enhance robustness. Formally, given an input audio a, representing either instructions instruct, content input, or both combined instruct+input, the speech encoder 7 Fae() produces audio features Za = Fae(X a). We use the features from the last Transformer layer in our experiments. Next, we consider trainable two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation to project audio features into text embedding space, for its empirical effectiveness and simplicity compared to more complex cross-modal alignment modules (Tang et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2024a; Lin et al., 2024). Concretely, given the encoder outputs Za, the projector maps them to the corresponding audio embeddings in the LLMs textual embedding space, denoted as = Fproj(Za), with Za = Fae(X a), yielding sequence of projected audio embeddings a. representational capacity."

The concatenation preserves the natural order of the audio and textual components. The concatenation procedure is flexible, uniformly supporting all three modality configurations, text instruction with audio input, pure audio, and audio instruction with text input, illustrated as Figure 6 (Top Left). We employ Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024) as the LLM backbone, mainstream choice. It is decoder-only Transformer with 28 layers, hidden dimension of 3072, and approximately 3.21B parameters.

Specifically, we construct and employ our LLaSOAlign, in which each training example comprises of textual instruction instruct, an audio input input, and the corresponding ground-truth transcript answer. The instruction and audio jointly prompt the model to transcribe the audio content, with the transcript serving as the target output. During this stage, we freeze both the audio encoder and the LLM, updating only the parameters of the MLP projector by maximizing the objective in Eq. 2, i.e., with trainable parameters Î¸ in Fproj. This approach enables the projector to map speech features into the pre-trained LLM word embedding space, establishing cross-modal semantic consistency for downstream instruction tuning, while preserving the knowledge in the frozen encoder and LLM. Stage 2: Instruction Tuning. After completing modality alignment, we train the model on LLaSO-Instruct, enabling it to acquire compositional instruction-following abilities across broad spectrum of speech-language tasks and modality configurations.

Cell shading , and no shading denotes each models relative ranking in given modality (best worst) by average GPT-4o score. , complete model outputs. However, certain tasks require an intermediate step of extracting structured answers from the model outputs prior to evaluation; such cases are explicitly noted in their respective metric descriptions below. Task-specific metric assignments are detailed in Table 2. WER and CER. Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) (Morris et al., 2004; huggingface, 2023; Chen et al., 1998) quantify transcription accuracy derived from Levenshtein distance (Navarro, 2001) between the model prediction and the ground-truth transcript. WER operates at the word level, while CER operates at the character level. Both metrics are employed for ASR and SCR tasks. Lower values indicate better accuracy. Typically, WER and CER scores range from 0 (perfect match) to 1, although values exceeding 1 can occur due to excessive insertions or substitutions. PER. Phoneme Error Rate (PER) is analogous to WER and CER but specifically measures the Levenshtein distance between the predicted and groundtruth phoneme sequences with (brianlan, 2017), providing phoneme-level accuracy assessment. Similar to WER and CER, lower PER values indicate superior performance, typically ranging from 0 upwards, with 0 representing perfect phoneme prediction. We apply this metric exclusively to the PR task. Accuracy. Accuracy is defined as the proportion of exact matches between the models prediction and the ground-truth label. This metric is applied to all closed-ended tasks, as specified in Table 12, which also indicates which tasks are openversus closed-ended. For closed-ended tasks, the model must select single answer from predefined label set, and response is marked correct only if it precisely matches the reference label; predictions containing multiple candidate labels or irrelevant content are treated as incorrect. Accuracy ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. Additionally, the metric is also computed for the open-ended PSSL task, where models rate sentence-level pronunciation across three dimensions, accuracy, prosodic, and fluency. Given that model outputs are typically free-form, we use regular expressions to extract numeric scores from responses, accommodating variations such as accuracy is 8, fluency: 7, or 9 for prosodic. Responses providing valid numeric scores for all three dimensions are retained; others are excluded. For each sample, we compute the average of the exactmatch accuracies across these three dimensions, then report the overall accuracy averaged across all evaluated samples. Further, we complement this rule-based measure with an additional GPT-4o evaluation to ensure comprehensive assessment. MAE. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is adopted for tasks requiring numerical predictions, such as AR and PR. In these tasks, the model is explicitly instructed to generate single numeric value. However, many LSLMs produce free-form textual outputs rather than direct numeric predictions (Adlakha et al., 2024), necessitating an answer extraction procedure prior to metric calculation. For the AR task, the predicted numeric value represents age and thus must be extracted reliably from the model output. Employing regular expression, our script"

For outputs containing descriptive keywordsadult without numeric information, we substitute canonical age value 22. The PR task requires evaluation of the models ability to predict MIDI note values ranging from 0 to 127. Specifically, our extraction function sequentially attempts integer conversion, rounded float conversion, and finally, averaging numeric ranges. Strings containing pitch-related keywords (e.g., \"midi\", \"pitch\", \"hz\") but lacking numeric values are marked as invalid predictions. Only predictions within the MIDI range of 0 to 127 are considered valid for metric computation. In all cases, if valid numeric value cannot be extracted from either the models prediction, that instance is omitted from the calculation. The final MAE is computed as the mean absolute difference between extracted predictions and ground-truth numeric values across all valid instances. Lower MAE values indicate better numerical prediction performance. GPT-4o Score. For AQA and other open-ended generative tasks, where model responses are unconstrained and may vary widely in form and content, thus we employ GPT-4o (OpenAI, gpt-4o-mini, Version 2024-07-18) as an automatic evaluator. Fol11 lowing standardized evaluation template, GPT-4o assigns an integer score from 1 to 5, reflecting both the relevance and accuracy of the models response relative to the reference answer. Further details of the evaluation prompt are provided in Appendix K, and task-specific metric assignments are summarized in Table 2. Abstention Rate. Some LSLMs may abstain from answering tasks involving unfamiliar modality formats or instructions, fail to follow instructions, or explicitly state their inability to process audio. To quantify such behavior, we report the abstention rate for closed-ended tasks, defined as the proportion of responses in which the model either refuses to answer, returns irrelevant content, or fails to select valid label from the predefined set. An abstention is counted whenever the models output does not comply with the task requirement to select label.

LLaSOBase achieves the highest overall score among all evaluated models. Notably, models with broader task coverage outperform those focusing primarily on AQA, such as Llama-Omni and Mini-Omni by significant margin, which are mostly optimized for similar semantic tasks or narrow tasks. This performance gap emphasizes the effectiveness of diverse task training. more detailed inspection of model behaviors across specific tasks and modality configurations is provided in Section 5.4. In Table 3 and 4 we present 11 LSLMs performance results across three modality configuarations and across all tasks, together with their abstention rate. We made the following observations. Firstly, there is notable variation in the distribution of across modality configurations. For instance, the two bestperforming models, LLaSO-Base and Kimi-Audio, exhibit performance drops exceeding 0.25 points across modalities. This variability confirms that our benchmark adequately evaluates model capabilities to diverse input formats. Additionally, we observe substantial differences in task-specific performances. Kimi-Audio achieves outstanding scores in AQA tasks across all modalities and demonstrates low abstention rates on paralinguistic tasks, yet scores notably lower on tasks like AR. These findings validate the benchmarks ability to comprehensively assess models across varied task domains. Secondly, we notice that LLaSO-Base not only performs well on the majority of tasks but also in maintaining low abstention rates, suggesting the models capacity for instruction following and its ability providing responses more aligned with user queries. This underscores the critical importance of incorporating task and modality diversity. Thirdly, it can be observed that models ranking lower overall tend to be speech-to-speech systems with narrow task focus, excelling mainly at AQA related objectives but performing less competitively on other tasks. However, these models demonstrate greater robustness to modality shifts. We hypothesize it benefiting from interleaving or parallel decoding strategies that help bridge the gap between textual and auditory modalities. Overall, while current LSLMs exhibit some capability in handling diverse speech-language tasks, our findings underscore the continued need to expand both task and modality diversity to drive further progress.

            "content": "We find that LSLMs perform poorly on unseen tasks and unfamiliar modality formats, with especially weak instruction-following in unseen tasks. LSLMs perform worse on unseen modality configuration. Most existing LSLMs only support one or two modality configurations. We evaluate their generalization across three different input formats. Specifically, we select representative models and calculate their average performance on AQA task across all major input modality configurations with results summarized in Table 3. We observe that 12 model performance in the audio instruction with text input setting drops consistently compared to the familiar text instruction with audio input configuration. At the same time we find that Qwen2Audio is an outlier, showing that it and its variant Audio-Reasoner obtain similar results in both formats. Notably, from human perspective, audio instruction with text input should be no more difficult and is arguably even simpler, since only the (typically brief) instruction needs to be heard, while the main input remains directly readable as text, as illustrated in Figure 5I (b, c). Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate that LSLMs still struggle with modality configurations outside their explicit training coverage. Pure audio modality configuration may still challenging. We illustrate the performance of 11 models three major modality formats in Figure 9 (Bottom). In most cases, models demonstrate substantially lower performance on pure audio formats than on the more common text instruction with audio input setting, even when they are explicitly trained to handle pure audio via speech-to-speech or spoken-query-based QA (SQQA) tasks. Notably, for some of these models, the performance drop from text with audio to pure audio is even greater than the decline observed on modality formats they have never seen during training, such as audio instruction with text input. Interestingly, only handful of models such as Qwen2.5-Omni, GLM-4-Voice, and the Mini-Omni family achieve comparable performance across pure audio and text + audio modalities. Nonetheless, for most current LSLMs, the pure audio configuration remains notably challenging setting. Interleaving and parallel decoding strategies help bridge performance gaps across modality configurations. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 9 (Bottom), nearly all models achieve their best results on the common text instruction with audio input setting. To assess model robustness to modality shifts, we compute the sum of absolute performance differences between this common configuration and the other two input formats. We present the results in ascending order of stability in Figure 9 (Top). Among the eleven models evaluated, the top eight with the exception of Qwen2-Audio and its variant employ interleaving or parallel decoding strategies (see Appendix for benchmarking model details), and exhibit notably reduced modality gaps. These outliers may reflect factors outside of modality combination design. Overall, our results provide empirical evidence that interleaving and parallel decoding can bridge the performance gap between text and audio modalities. Figure 9: Stability and modality-wise performance of LSLMs. Top: Model stability across modality configurations, quantified by the sum of absolute differences between each models average GPT-4o score on the primary modality (TA) and those on the other two modalities, i.e., TA PA + TA AT. Lower values reflect greater robustness to modality variation. Bottom: Average GPT-4o score of each model on the three major modality configurations. Colors are consistent across both plots for direct comparison. Abbreviations: PA = pure audio; TA = text instruction + audio input; AT = audio instruction + text input. Broader task coverage leads to better performance and lower abstention rates. We present the overall performance, closed-ended task performance, and closed-ended task abstention rates for 11 models, alongside the number of tasks each model was trained on, in Figure 10. For models with private, incomplete, or ambiguously reported training data, we use the number of evaluation tasks as proxy for task coverage. The results show that models exposed to wider range of tasks achieve higher performance in both overall and closedended tasks, and fewer abstentions. This finding suggests that, in creating LSLMs for speech understanding, one should diversify the tasks as much as possible, to improve the model performance and reduce the abstention rate. 13 for current LSLMs and highlighting an important area for future improvement.

            "content": "Figure 5 provides qualitative evidence of the compositional flexibility and unified modeling offered by our framework. Panel (I) demonstrates that LLaSO-Base seamlessly accommodates all three instruction-input modality pairings. In particular, the pure audio example highlights the systems ability to disentangle instructions from content solely within the audio stream. For the other formats, LLaSO-Base reliably grounds reasoning and response generation in the correct modality, adapting to instructions and content presented in any combination. We present some task prototypes unified by our system in Panel (II) and present more cases across different instruction-input structures and tasks in Appendix E. These examples show that, unlike models limited rigid instruction-input structures, LLaSO-Base generalizes across both categorical and compositional tasks without requiring task-specific modules or post-processing. Figure 10: Task coverage vs. model performance and abstention. Each scatter plot visualizes 11 models by their Task Count (number of training tasks; for models with private, incomplete, or ambiguously reported training data, we use the number of evaluation tasks as proxy for task coverage). (a) Overall performance (min-max normalized over all LLaSOEval tasks, cf. Figure 8). (b) Average Closed-ended task performance. (c) Average abstention rate on closed-ended tasks. Closed-ended scores and abstention rates are calculated only on tasks that require categorical selection. Higher scores indicate better performance; lower abstention rates indicate stronger instruction following. LSLMs may prefer content related tasks. To further analyze model performance on paralinguistic tasks, we present dumbbell plot in Figure 11, contrasting content-centric and speaker-centric results for each model. We observe that most models achieve higher performance and lower abstention rates on content-centric tasks than on speakercentric ones. This disparity likely arises because content-centric tasks are more tightly linked to the semantic content, which LLM-based decoders are naturally equipped to process. In contrast, speakercentric tasks demand more nuanced inference of latent speaker attributes, posing greater challenge 14 the instruction and content as audio, yet responds with counter-question: What is the answer to the question? This indicates that while the model has some prior exposure to SQQA tasks, it fails to correctly interpret or respond to this particular modality configuration where both instruction and content are delivered as audio. In Figure 12 (I)(c), where an audio instruction is followed by textual input, the spoken instruction assigns generic task, prompting the model to generate an answer, while the accompanying text presents tweet and asks for its sentiment, providing two answer options. The relevant information for reasoning is contained within the text input, and the instruction directs the model to perform classification. However, the model does not follow the instruction; instead, it merely repeats the sentiment options, 1. negative 2. positive, without making decision. We observe similar results in Llama-Omni across modality formats, illustrated in Figure 12 (II). This model is primarily trained on pure audio modality, and this is directly reflected in the sampled cases. In (II)(a) where both the instruction and input are delivered as audio, the model answers successfully classifying the object as non-living, demonstrating effective handling of its core modality. Nonetheless, when presented with configurations outside this primary distribution, the model fails to execute the intended tasks. In the text plus audio modality format (II)(b), it is unable to infer the speakers aim from the speech and instead requests further contextual details. Under (II)(c) the modality configuration of audio instruction paired with textual input, the model follows speech instruction but overlooks the explicit negation in the text input and incorrectly judges the two sentences as equivalent. Taken together, this observation highlights the importance of comprehensive modality coverage for multimodal instruction following. To provide an intuitive comparison of model performance on covered versus uncovered tasks, we sample cases for representative baselines in Figure 13. Figure 13 (I) illustrates this contrast for Typhoon-Audio model. In (I)(a) we present sample from the entity extraction task, which is not included in the models training. Here, the query requests identification of entities from the speech, but the model misinterprets the task as speaker gender classification, responding with The speaker is female. We present pronunciation scoring sentence-level (PSSL) task sample in (I)(b), where the model is instructed to evaluate the speech for ac- (I) Three evaluated cases from Salmonn across the primary modality configurations. The correct one corresponds to the models supported training format; the two errors are from modality formats with limited or no training exposure. (II) Three Llama-Omni responses sampled from the three major modality configurations. The correct example comes from its supported format; the two errors are from its unsupported modality configurations. Figure 12: Cases comparing model behaviors under different modality configurations in LLaSO-Eval. These cases highlight the importance of supporting multiple modality configurations to ensure instruction following across real-world scenarios. To better understand the challenges across modality configurations and tasks, we further present cases under the same benchmark. As shown in Figure 12 (I), we sample three representative cases for Salmonn across the primary modality configurations. In case (I)(b) with textual instruction and audio input, the models familiar modality configuration, Salmonn correctly follows the user instruction. The textual instruction asks the model to determine whether the first sentence in the speech content can be used to define the term in the second sentence, and to answer yes or no. The audio provides definition of database in the first sentence and describes MySQL in the second. The model correctly interprets both the instruction and the speech, and returns the correct answer yes. In contrast, when the modality configuration shifts outside the models primary training distribution, distinct failures emerge. Under the pure audio setting (I)(a) the model receives both 15 These findings underscore the essential role of comprehensive task coverage in building models across diverse speech-language tasks."

We Table 5 and 6. evaluate ASR performance both immediately after the alignment stage and following the subsequent instruction-tuning phase. After alignment, the model achieves strong results (WER = 0.05, CER = 0.01). After multi-task instruction tuning, ASR performance declines slightly (WER = 0.08, CER = 0.03), yet remains competitive, due to we include ASR samples within the LLaSO-Instruct dataset for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. (ii) Encoder Fine-tuning. We ablate the effect of unfreezing the audio encoder during the instructionfollowing stage, comparing the results of freezing versus jointly training the encoder, projector, and LLM on LLaSO-Instruct. When the encoder is unfrozen, ASR performance drops more substantially (WER = 0.14, CER = 0.07), relative to the frozen configuration. In contrast, AQA (semantic) tasks see modest improvements (see Table 5), while paralinguistic tasks exhibit slight decline (see Table 6). This suggests that while joint fine-tuning may benefit certain high-level reasoning tasks, it may compromise low-level speech recognition and nuanced paralinguistic abilities."

However, it only provides plain transcription and omits the required scoring. In contrast, when evaluated on task present in its training, the model demonstrates accurate performance. For the ASR task presented at (I)(c) the model successfully transcribes the speech to text as instructed without additional information. Similar results are evident with GLM-4-Voice in Figure 13 (II). In (II)(a) tasked with synthetic speech detection, the model avoids providing categorical decision and instead produces an off-topic statement. When we prompt the model for emotion recognition, it generates generic conversational reply, neglecting to engage with the specified sentiment classification task as in (II)(b). Nevertheless, we can observe that the model successfully completes an audio question answering task in (II)(c), owing to the presence of this task in its training. In addition to our quantitative analysis, closer manual inspection of model outputs reveals several distinct patterns and recurring issues that warrant discussion. For example, Qwen2-Audio occasionally misinterprets the SV task as SGC. On other tasks, Although this model achieves relatively strong quantitative scores on the open-ended PP task, qualitative check reveals that large proportion of its outputs are empty strings (41 cases) or single periods (30 cases) among 112 samples in the text instruction plus audio input configuration. For the VC task, the abstention rate is especially high. In our manual review, 82 out of 100 samples in the same modality setting resulted in single period (.) as the response. As to Typhoon-Audio, it occasionally responds in Thai to English prompts, which is likely attributable to the inclusion of Thai data during fine-tuning.

Metrics follow earlier tables. with pure audio or audio plus text modality input, often refuses to answer, asks clarifying questions, or claims the audio contains no content; this may stem from its limited exposure to pure audio instruction data (approximately 20K SQQA task samples from WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015)) and to the modality configuration of audio instruction with text input, restricting its ability to generalize. Additionally, in the ASR task, Salmonns outputs for most samples consist entirely of uppercase English letters, which explains its poor quantitative performance on this task. GLM-4-Voice frequently generates responses in Chinese and at times misinterprets the audio input as part of the conversational context, rather than as content to be analyzed. similar pattern is observed in the Mini-Omni family, which occasionally interprets the audio input, such as speakers utterance to be classified, as either an instruction or as primary content. For example, in ASR task with the text plus audio input configuration, approximately 43% of Mini-Omni and 53% of Mini-Omni2 responses begin with phrases like It sounds like..., reflecting tendency to treat the input as dialogue. Meanwhile Llama-Omni exhibits high rate of refusals in tasks beyond AQA, suggesting limited coverage of tasks. Manual inspection of its ASR task outputs further reveals that over 10% of samples are explicit abstains, likely because the model was not trained on ASR data. These phenomena further illustrate the necessity for broad and balanced coverage across both tasks and modality configurations in model development. Audio-Reasoner presents different set of challenges, often exhibiting hallucinated completions such as appending the answer is or fabricating multiple-choice options like E, F, or S. Since it is trained on Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with chainof-thought data, this tendency may stem from exposure to reasoning-style supervision. Kimi-Audio, when performing the PR task, sometimes treats the input as an ASR query or outputs sequence of isolated phonemes, which leads to lower evaluation scores. Qwen2.5-Omni occasionally shows similar confusion between PR and ASR, and routinely appends conversational phrases like feel free to ask me more. While such additions might be intended to improve user interaction, they can undermine instruction following if overfitting, as some tasks in our benchmark explicitly requires models to return only the answer. Taken together, these observations offer practical insights into persistent issues in instruction following, task differentiation, and output format consistency. We hope these manual inspections are helpful for the community and can inform future model development and evaluation."

            "title": "A Limitation",
            "content": "While our work establishes unified, open-source foundation for compositional speech-language instruction tuning, several limitations remain. First, LLaSO Corpus is currently limited to English, which constrains its direct applicability to nonEnglish and low-resource languages. Extending the dataset and benchmark to multilingual scenarios is an important direction for achieving broader impact and inclusivity. Second, despite surpassing prior datasets in task diversity and modality coverage, the granularity and availability of source materials inherently influence our corpus composition, particularly in the underrepresented paralinguistic categories and rare interaction scenarios. Third, our reference model, LLaSO-Base, intentionally prioritizes reproducibility and extensibility over achieving SOTA performance. Consequently, its architecture and model size (3.8 billion parameters) are modest compared to larger models, and our evaluations have primarily included similarly sized or smaller baselines. Assessing and benchmarking significantly larger LSLMs would provide further insights into scaling behaviors and capabilities. Fourth, certain challenging multimodal interactions such as open-ended dialogues involving overlapping speech, or zero-shot generalization to entirely new domains are only partially addressed within our current benchmark and model architecture. We encourage the research community to build upon our foundation to tackle these limitations, further"

            "title": "D Task Category Definitions",
            "content": "To facilitate comprehensive and interpretable evaluation, both our training and evaluation datasets are systematically organized into three principal categories: linguistic, semantic, and paralinguistic. This categorization is designed to capture the spectrum of speech-language understanding, from core speech processing and factual reasoning to the nuanced interpretation of speaker traits and acoustic context. Next will describe the definitions of each categories. D.1 Linguistic Category Linguistic tasks are aimed at assessing models basic speech processing ability, primarily through ASR. This foundational category evaluates how accurately model can transcribe spoken language into text, serving as the backbone for subsequent semantic or paralinguistic inference. D.2 Semantic Category The semantic category tests models ability to extract explicit meaning and perform higher-level reasoning over audio input. In our benchmark, this is represented by the AQA task, which requires models to interpret audio content, combine it with contextual cues, and deliver factual or reasoning-based responses. Although limited to AQA, this category is critical for evaluating the transition from basic perception to comprehension and inference. D.3 Paralinguistic Category Paralinguistic tasks are structured to probe models sensitivity to information that lies beyond the literal linguistic content. We further distinguish between speaker-centric and content-centric paralinguistic tasks. Speaker-centric tasks focus on characteristics inherent to the speaker such as gender, age, accent, emotion, and identity capturing traits that are independent of the message being delivered. In contrast, content-centric tasks emphasize cues embedded in the audio signal that reflect content or context, such as phoneme recognition, intent prediction, or entity extraction, irrespective of speaker identity."
