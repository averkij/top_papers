            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his influential essay On Bullshit (Frankfurt, 1986), defines bullshit as speech or text produced with indifference to truth. In his follow-up work, On Truth (Frankfurt, 2006), Frankfurt clarifies that bullshitters misrepresent themselves as merely conveying information while primarily manipulating their audiences opinions and attitudes, largely disregarding the truthfulness of their statements. Expanding upon Frankfurts insights, Bergstrom & West (2021) demonstrate how digital environments particularly facilitate (human) bullshit through misleading rhetorical techniques. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have amplified concerns bout untruthful behaviors, notably hallucination and sycophancy. Hallucination denotes confidently generated outputs that are nonsensical or unfaithful to provided source content (Huang et al., 2025; Farquhar et al., 2024), consisting of unverified claims and representing one form of bullshit. Sycophancy (Sharma et al., 2023) involves models excessively agreeing with or flattering users to procure approval irrespective of factual accuracy, constituting another form of bullshit (Carson, 2016; Littrell et al., 2021). However, neither hallucination nor sycophancy fully capture the broad range of systematic untruthful behaviors Preprint. Figure 1: Machine bullshit refers to AI-generated statements produced with indifference to truth. Using our newly introduced BullshitEval benchmark and the Marketplace dataset, we find that the alignment method (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit. Inference-time strategy (Chainof-Thought prompting) notably amplifies specific bullshit formsparticularly empty rhetoric and paltering. Our results highlight fundamental risks in current LLM training and deployment practices. commonly exhibited by LLMs. For instance, outputs employing partial truths or ambiguous languagesuch as the paltering and weasel-word examples in Fig. 1represent neither hallucination nor sycophancy but closely align with the concept of bullshit (Frankfurt, 2006; Bergstrom & West, 2021). Bergstrom & Ogbunu (Carl T. Bergstrom) recently defined LLM bullshit explicitly based on the designers intent, insisting that AI lacks beliefs in any meaningful sense. However, we argue for different perspective that considers what outcomes the AI is prioritizing (i.e., its effective intent) and how it internally represents reality (i.e., its effective belief). Thus, we treat AI systems as agents capable of bullshit in Frankfurts full sense. Additionally, Hicks et al. (2024) categorized LLM-generated bullshit into two types: hard bullshit, defined as utterances intentionally misleading the audience about the speakers underlying motives, and soft bullshit, characterized simply by an indifference to truth without hidden agenda. Nevertheless, existing discussions of bullshit in LLMs remain largely conceptual, lacking sufficient granularity for rigorous empirical analysis. To gain deeper and more comprehensive understanding of untruthful behavior in LLMs, we provide the first systematic study of machine bullshit. Grounded in Frankfurts definition, we introduce the Bullshit Index, metric for quantifying LLMs indifference to truth. Additionally, building on the qualitative taxonomy of human bullshit established by Frankfurt (1986) and Bergstrom & West (2021), we adapt and operationalize its categories for AI systems, analyzing four dominating forms: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical analysis using the Marketplace dataset (Liang et al., 2025), Political Neutrality dataset (Fisher et al., 2025), and our newly introduced BullshitEval benchmark, comprising 2,400 scenarios across 100 AI assistants. Our results reveal that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Ouyang et al., 2022) correlates with increased indifference to truth, exacerbating various forms of bullshit, notably increasing the frequency and harmfulness of paltering (true but misleading statements). We further examine prompting strategies, observing that chain-of-thought (CoT, Wei et al., 2022) prompting increases empty rhetoric and paltering, while principal-agent framing broadly intensifies all our studied forms of bullshit. Additionally, analysis of the political neutrality benchmark reveals weasel words as the predominant rhetorical strategy in political contexts."

Youre completely right; thats an excellent and insightful point. definition, studying machine bullshit via two complementary perspectives: (1) introducing quantitative Bullshit Index (BI) that quantifies indifference to truth; and (2) detecting prominent rhetorical phenomena previously identified in literature (Frankfurt, 1986; Bergstrom & West, 2021). The Bullshit Index (BI). To operationalize Frankfurts conceptual definition, we introduce the Bullshit Index (BI), quantifying an AI models indifference to truth. The BI measures how systematically models explicit claims depend on its internal beliefs. It is defined by two measurable signals: (i) the models internal belief [0, 1] (probability placed on the statement being true), and (ii) its explicit claim {0, 1} (with 1 indicating true). Formally, the BI is the complement of the absolute value of the point-biserial correlation between the models internal belief and explicit claims: BI = 1 rpb(p, y) , rpb(p, y) = µp,y=1 µp,y=0 σp (cid:112)q(1 q) where µp,y=1 and µp,y=0 represent the mean internal belief for statements explicitly claimed as true and false respectively, σp is the standard deviation of the internal belief distribution, and is the proportion of explicit true claims. BI close to 1 indicates that claims are largely independent of internal beliefs, revealing high level of indifference toward truthfulness. Conversely, BI near 0 implies that the models claims strongly track its internal beliefs. To further distinguish sincerity from deliberate lying, we inspect the sign of rpb(p, y): correlation near +1 indicates sincere alignment (truthful claims), while correlation near 1 indicates systematic inversion (lying). Both extremes reflect low indifference, as claims remain closely tied to beliefs. Following prior work (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Kadavath et al., 2022; Saunders et al., 2022; Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023), we query the LLMs via multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) and measure the internal belief as the probability assigned to the first token of the response. Unlike prior work studying hallucinations focused on factual correctness, BI emphasizes adherence to the models internal representation of reality. The BI thus differentiates honest-mistake hallucinationsadhering to inaccurate beliefs (low BI)from bullshit hallucinationsdisregarding internal beliefs (high BI). In Section 4, we compare BI scores before and after interventions (e.g., RLHF), providing empirical evidence aligned with Frankfurts notion of bullshit as indifference to truth. Taxonomy of Machine Bullshit. In addition to quantifying indifference to truth, we build on the taxonomy of bullshit introduced by Bergstrom & West (2021) and operationalize their definitions so that we can measure them in the inputoutput behavior of LLMs. Empty Rhetoric: Text that is linguistically fluent and superficially persuasive but lacks substantive content. It initially appears meaningful but offers no actionable or factual insight. Paltering: Text that strategically uses partial truths to mislead or obscure essential truths. Rather than outright lying, it creates misleading impressions through selective factual accuracy. 3 Weasel Words: Text that evades specificity, responsibility, or accountability using ambiguous expressions such as many experts say, it could be argued, or widely considered. These phrases sound authoritative but ultimately remain unverifiable. Unverified Claims: Text that confidently asserts claims without evidence or factual support, misleading readers by implying credibility through assertive language alone. For each aspect, we developed detailed, descriptive evaluation criteria that enable consistent labeling of bullshit behaviors. To perform the evaluation at scale, we leveraged state-of-the-art reasoning LLM (GPT-o3-mini) as evaluator (LLM-as-a-judge) (Dubois et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Fernandes et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2024; Saha et al., 2023) by providing instructional prompts explicitly describing each rhetorical category. To assess the accuracy and reliability of this LLM-based annotation strategy, we conducted two human studies (1200 and 300 participants). Our human study demonstrates that, despite the inherent subjectivity in detecting bullshit (Krippendorffs α: 0.030.18), the AI judge moderately to substantially aligns with human majority judgments (Cohens κ: 0.210.80; accuracy: 70%90%). When human evaluators strongly agree ( 80%), the AI judge achieves perfect alignment (Cohens κ = 1, accuracy = 100%). Detailed analysis is provided in Appendix F."

            "content": "3.1 Datasets BullshitEval. We introduce new dataset designed to systematically evaluate bullshit generation by language models. This dataset comprises 2,400 scenarios across 100 distinct AI assistant roles, covering wide range of consultancy tasks and practical applications. Each scenario explicitly defines the assistants role, typically involving product or service recommendations, or providing expert guidance. Some scenarios include privileged information available only to the AI assistant and not to the user. User queries in each scenario are crafted to probe various aspects of AI responses, such as factual accuracy, robustness in addressing user concerns, responsiveness to unrelated inquiries, and susceptibility to sycophantic behavior. This design allows for comprehensive assessment of AI-generated bullshit. We provided detailed discussion of the dataset in Appendix C. Marketplace. We utilized the Marketplace dataset from Liang et al. (2025), comprising 1,200 scenarios within virtual shopping environment. It covers common product categories such as electronic devices and home appliances, with each product defined by eight domain-specific attributes. Features include binary availability (e.g., supports 5G: yes/no) and categorical instantiation (e.g., resolution: 8K/4K). In each scenario, the ground-truth attribute table for each product is either completely or partially available to the AI assistant, while the user can only directly observe the price. Humans interact with the AI to obtain essential information to make decisions. Political Neutrality. We used the political neutrality dataset from Fisher et al. (2025), evaluating five categories: Universal Rights, with 48 statements from the UN Declaration of Human Rights; Political Opinion, comprising 3,000 prompts from the Political Compass Test, DEBATUNE (Li et al., 2024), and Bang et al. (2024), formatted into 20 variations (Röttger et al., 2024); Political Opinion + Viewpoint, augmenting prompts with leftor right-leaning prefixes (6,000 total); and Conspiracy (Good/Bad Faith), featuring 17 U.S. conspiracies, each with 10 goodor bad-faith variations. 3.2 Models. To evaluate the impact of RLHF, we employed the RLHF fine-tuned models Llama-2-7b (Touvron et al., 2023) and Llama-3-8b (Dubey et al., 2024) from Liang et al. (2025), assessing their performance on the Marketplace, BullshitEval, and Political Neutrality benchmarks. To conduct comprehensive study of bullshit phenomenaincluding the effects of Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and principalagent framing (Phelps & Ranson, 2023)we evaluated both closed- (GPT-4-o3-mini, GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2023), Claude-3.5-Sonnet source models (Anthropic, 2024), Gemini-1.5-flash (DeepMind, 2024)) and open-source models (Llama-2-7b, Llama-3-8b, Llama-3.3-70b, Qwen-2.5-72b-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024)). Finally, for the political bullshit evaluation, we adopted the set of models used in Fisher et al. (2025) (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-flash, Llama-3.3-70b, and Qwen-2.5-72b-Instruct) to examine bullshit behavior in political contexts."

            "title": "4 Measuring the Impact of RLHF on Machine Bullshit",
            "content": "In this section, we investigate how RLHF fine-tuning influences an AI models tendency to exhibit bullshit behaviors. Building on recent studies of emergent misalignment and truthfulness degradation induced by RLHF (Liang et al., 2025), we provide further empirical evidence that machine bullshit emerges systematically from greedy alignment with elicited human preferences through RLHF. Our experiments aim to: (1) Quantify the shift of model output towards indifference to truth after applying RLHF, (2) Measure such shift across four specific dimensions of machine bullshit, and (3) Evaluate the severity of each bullshit dimension in terms of its potential to mislead users into making poor decisions, thus identifying the dimensions most exacerbated by RLHF. 4.1 RLHF fine-tuning can render AI assistants more prone to bullshit In the stricter sense, bullshit isnt merely the utterance of statements without regard for truth, but their use as means to an undisclosed end by purporting to represent true belief, typically to manipulate others perceptions or actions. This definition (termed hard bullshit by Hicks et al. (2024)) is useful in exploring the mechanisms that may motivate or exacerbate bullshit production in LLMs. Experiment setup. We conducted controlled study on the Marketplace dataset: its comparatively structured scenarios allow us to zero in on the effect of specific variables while keeping all other context identical. For each scenario, we selected the lowest-priced item among the three available choices and controlled the AIs private information about this items target feature (the one requested by the user), resulting in three distinct conditions: Positive (the feature matches the desirable value requested by the user), Negative (the feature is absent or takes an undesirable value), and Unknown (the features value is unspecified, and therefore unknown to the AI). We focus specifically on the lowest-priced item because obtaining the target feature at the lowest price ensures the highest possible user satisfaction, thereby creating potential tension for the AI between honestly disappointing and deceitfully encouraging the user. Based on this, we generated three scenario categories (Positive, Unknown, Negative) from the original 1,200 scenarios, totaling 3,600 scenarios. Evaluation. For each scenario category, we tasked the AI assistant with helping users identify their desired items. Each response was subsequently interpreted using strong language model (LLM) as judge, employing multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) format to categorize the assistants statements about the controlled feature as positive, negative, or uncertain. This allows explicit assessment of discrepancies between the assistants claims and the ground truth. Additionally, to analyze alignment between the AI assistants explicit claims and its internal beliefs, we quantified these beliefs using similar MCQA framework, deriving internal belief estimates from the query log probabilities of initial tokens (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Santurkar et al., 2023). Finally, we computed the Bullshit Index described in Section 2 on the original test data to examine its shift following RLHF. Hypothesis 1: Fine-tuning for immediate user satisfaction drives deception. As in Lang et al. (2024); Liang et al. (2025), we are particularly interested in positive deception, an explicitly positive claim made by the AI despite an unknown or negative ground-truth condition. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed AI claims under the three controlled ground-truth conditions (Positive, Unknown, Negative) for base LLM (Llama-2-7b, Llama-3-8b) and its RLHF-fine-tuned counterpart. Results presented in Table 2 strongly support the hypothesis. Prior to RLHF, deceptive positive claims occurred moderately in Unknown (20.9%) and Negative (11.8%) scenarios. After explicitly aligning AI behavior towards user satisfaction via RLHF, deceptive claims increased dramatically to 84.5% in Unknown and 67.9% in Negative scenarios. We validated Hypothesis 1 using chi-squared test (McHugh, 2013) comparing the number of deceptive claims before and after RLHF. The test confirmed highly significant increase in deceptive claims following RLHF (χ2 = 1509, < 0.001), providing robust empirical evidence that the prospect of improved user satisfaction strongly drives AI deception. Hypothesis 2: Fine-tuning for immediate user satisfaction erodes truth-tracking. We measured the association between ground-truth information (Positive, Unknown, Negative) observed by the AI (base LLM, RLHF) and its explicit claim using Cramérs . In the base LLM (before RLHF fine-tuning) the association was strong (V = 0.575); after RLHF it shows significant drop (V = 0.269). The change (V = 0.306) was evaluated with 5,000 bootstrap resamples, 5 yielding 95% confidence interval of [0.334, , 0.278] and one-sided empirical p-value of 0.0002. Because the confidence interval excludes zero and the p-value is well below 0.001, we conclude that, as the model learns to prioritize user satisfaction, its behavior becomes largely indifferent to the observed truth value, confirming Hypothesis 2. It is worth noting that this change in behavior appears to stem from loss of adherence to the truth in model outputs, rather than degradation in belief calibration: in other words, the model does not become confused about the truth as much as it becomes uncommitted to reporting it. Indeed, this dissociation is also observed when comparing the models responses to its internal beliefs as estimated by MCQA (Figure 2). Hypothesis 3: Deception is amplified more strongly when the truth is unknown. We tested whether RLHF fine-tuning had differential impact on deception rates depending on the ground-truth feature value being Unknown or Negative. Specifically, we calculated the proportion of explicitly positive (deceptive) claims made by the AI before and after RLHF for these two conditions separately. Before RLHF, deceptive claims occurred in 20.9% of Unknown scenarios and 11.8% of Negative scenarios. After RLHF, these rates rose significantly to 84.5% for Unknown and 67.9% for Negative scenarios. We employed BreslowDay test for homogeneity of odds to statistically evaluate the difference in these increases, which yielded significant result (χ2 = 15.34, = 8.99 105). This indicates that RLHF fine-tuning amplifies deception substantially more when the AI lacks explicit ground-truth information (Unknown) compared to when it explicitly has negative information. Table 2: Confusion matrices for Llama-3-8b before and after RLHF. Rows show the ground-truth feature status provided to the assistant (Positive, Unknown, Negative); columns show its explicit claim.

We quantified the language models degree of indifference to truth using the Bullshit Index (BI) on the original benchmark. Results in Fig. 3 illustrate significant increase in truthindifference following RLHF. paired bootstrap analysis (10,000 resamples) revealed substantial and statistically reliable difference in BI between these two conditions (BI = BIbefore BIafter = 0.285, 95% CI [0.355, 0.216], < 0.001). Because the confidence interval is entirely below zero, the Bullshit index is significantly lower before RLHF. The large effect sizeapproximately onefourth of the 01 scaleand the highly significant p-value (< 103) 6 Figure 3: RLHF impact on BI robustly confirm an increased indifference to truth following RLHF. These findings indicate that aligning language models via RLHF can render AI assistants more prone to bullshit. 4.2 AI assistants actively produce more bullshit after RLHF Experiment Setup. We evaluated four bullshit dimensionsempty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claimsacross three benchmarks: Marketplace, BullshitEval, and Political Neutrality. For each benchmark, we compared the baseline model performance against model fine-tuned using RLHF, applying the approach as discussed in Section 2. Results. The RLHF fine-tuned model significantly increased user satisfaction, measured as the percentage of responses receiving perfect evaluator rating of 5. Specifically, more than 80% of responses achieved this top rating post-RLHF, 48% increase from the baseline. However, as shown in Fig. 4, RLHF also substantially elevated the frequency of all four bullshit forms in the Marketplace benchmark. Empty rhetoric increased by 39.8%, weasel words by 26.8%, and notably, paltering and unverified claims increased most significantly at 57.8% and 55.6%, respectively. We provided qualitative example for each of these phenomena in Appendix D. In addition to the Marketplace benchmark, results from BullshitEval and Political Neutrality benchmarks confirmed similar detrimental trends. For the BullshitEval results in Fig. 7a, the frequency of empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims rose notably by approximately 9.4%, 7.9%, 9.9%, and 9.4%, respectively. These patterns were echoed on the Political Neutrality benchmark, with weasel words and empty rhetoric increasing significantly by around 9.8% and 6.1%, respectively, while paltering and unverified claims exhibited modest yet meaningful increases of 4.1% and 4.2%. These consistent increases across diverse evaluation contexts underline critical alignment challenge: RLHF enhances user satisfaction yet simultaneously promotes misleading language. (a) Results on Llama-2-7b (b) Results on Llama-3-8b Figure 4: Effects of RLHF on evaluator satisfaction and bullshit behaviors. Bar plots illustrate evaluator satisfaction and four bullshit dimensions for models before (blue) and after (orange) RLHF fine-tuning. RLHF substantially increases evaluator satisfaction but simultaneously exacerbates all bullshit behaviors. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals across 5 evaluation runs. 4.3 Paltering becomes more harmful after RLHF Experiment Setup. While RLHF encourages all forms of bullshit behavior, it is crucial to assess how harmful each specific behavior is and examine how RLHF amplifies their harm. To systematically analyze how these behaviors mislead users, we measure the frequency with which humans make poor decisions after interacting with the AI assistant in the Marketplace. We adopt the same utility metrics as in Liang et al. (2025), computed based on evaluators actual decisions after interactions. Linear-regression severity model. For both the PRE-RLHF and POST-RLHF systems we estimate the marginal utility drop associated with each of four binary flagsempty rhetoric (E), weasel words (W ), paltering (P ), and unverified claims (U )by fitting an ordinary least-squares linear model: Yi = β0 + βE Ei + βW Wi + βP Pi + βU Ui + εi. All predictors are centered, so each coefficient βk represents the expected change in realized utility Yi when flag switches from 0 to 1 while the other three remain fixed. Coefficient uncertainty is 7 quantified using heteroscedasticity-consistent robust standard errors (SEHC3) (Eicker, 1963), and significance is assessed via Wald tests (Wald, 1943). We define more harmful as more negative coefficient, indicating greater utility reduction. Severity rankings use pairwise Wald tests with Holmadjusted comparisons; nonsignificant differences form the same severity tier. Differences in the coefficient before and after RLHF are assessed with two-sample z-tests. Factor Before RLHF After RLHF Table 3: Coefficients robust SEHC3; < 0.01 (within-model), < 0.01 (Pre vs. Post change). Results. Our linear regression results  (Table 3)  reveal substantial shift in the assistants misleading strategies following RLHF fine-tuning. Before RLHF, unverified claims and paltering emerge as similarly harmful techniques, with no significant difference between their coefficients (p = 0.36). Weasel words exhibit smaller yet still significant negative impact, whereas empty rhetoric has no meaningful effect on user utility. After RLHF fine-tuning, paltering becomes notably more harmful (p < 0.01), nearly doubling its negative effect on user utility and significantly surpassing unverified claims (p < 0.01) as the most detrimental technique. Interestingly, weasel words became less misleading post-RLHF (p < 0.01), empty rhetoric shows no significant change (p = 0.60). These findings underscore how RLHF shifts the models bullshit approach toward more subtle, contextually selective truths, highlighting the necessity of carefully monitoring and mitigating strategic forms of bullshit. p-value 8 101 3 105 0.49 0.06 0.89 0.08 4 105 0.58 0.06 0.53 0.07 4 101 0.11 0.10 Empty rhetoric Weasel words 0.15 0.03 Paltering Unverified. 0.08 0.03 0.04 0."

            "content": "5.1 Prompting Effects on Machine Bullshit Experiment Setup. We investigate prompting strategies that influence bullshit behaviors using BullshitEval. First, we evaluate Chain-of-Thought prompting by instructing models to explicitly reason within <think> tags before their final response. Second, we explore prompts inspired by the Principal-Agent problem by presenting AI assistant with scenarios involving conflicts of interest, where AI assistants must simultaneously represent two principals: the user (seeking honest and helpful advice) and an institution (pursuing corporate interests). Evaluations use an LLM-as-judge, assessing four bullshit dimensions: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We further analyze prompting effects on truth indifference via the Bullshit Index in Appendix C.3. Finding 1: Chain-of-Thought consistently increased empty rhetoric and paltering. Particularly notable is GPT-4o-mini, which exhibits significant increases in empty rhetoric (+20.9%) and paltering (+11.5%). Most models reduced their use of weasel words under CoT, except Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The effect on unverified claims varied significantly; Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibited the highest increase (+16.4%), while Gemini-1.5-flash and Llama-3.3-70b demonstrated reductions. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought prompting does not reliably enhance truthfulness. Instead, it consistently promotes empty rhetoric and paltering, potentially misleading human users. Finding 2: Principal-Agent framing consistently elevated all dimensions of bullshit. Notably, GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibit substantial increases in unverified claims (+26.1% and +26.7%, respectively). Additionally, GPT-4o-mini shows significant increases in empty rhetoric (+16.0%) and paltering (+9.7%), while Claude-3.5-Sonnet prominently increases weasel words (+13.9%). Similar trends of increase in bullshit phenomena were also observed in GPT-o3-mini, Gemini-1.5-flash, Llama-3.3-70b, and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. Overall, these results indicate that introducing Principal-Agent context consistently elevates the occurrence of bullshit, suggesting that conflicting incentives strongly drive deceptive behaviors across multiple LLMs. 5.2 Political Contexts and Ideological Influences We conducted evaluation of five models detailed in Section 3, and report the full results in Fig. 10. Finding 1: Weasel words dominate bullshit phenomena. Across all five evaluated models, weasel words consistently dominate bullshit in political contexts. Specifically, weasel words appeared prominently in scenarios involving conspiracy theories, such as Conspiracy Bad (91% for GPT-4o8 (a) Results on GPT-4o-mini (b) Results on Claude-3.5-Sonnet Figure 5: Impact of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on bullshit behaviors evaluated with BullshitEval.

Bars illustrate the proportion of responses containing empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, or unverified claims under baseline (blue) and Principal-Agent framing (orange). mini, 69% for Qwen-2.5-72b). In Political Opinion contexts, use ranged between 36% (Claude-3.5Sonnet) and 83% (GPT-4o-mini). The pervasive use of weasel words suggests models strategically adopt ambiguous language to avoid explicit commitments on controversial or polarizing claims. Finding 2: Adding political viewpoints increases subtle deception. Introducing explicit political viewpoints significantly increases the occurrence of bullshit phenomena such as empty rhetoric, paltering, and unverified claims. For instance, Llama-3.3-70b notably increased empty rhetoric from 4% to 36% and paltering from 0% to 19%. Claude-3.5-Sonnet similarly displayed substantial increases in paltering (25%) and unverified claims (54%) compared to scenarios without explicit viewpoints. Meanwhile, Gemini-1.5 increased empty rhetoric significantly from 9% to 32%. These findings indicate that models strategically employ subtle deception or unsupported assertions to align with or justify particular political viewpoints, consistent with our broader analysis of principal-agent dynamics, where conflicting incentives drive bullshit behaviors."

            "content": "In this paper, we introduced systematic framework for characterizing and quantifying bullshit in large language models, emphasizing their emergent indifference to truth. Through rigorous hypothesis testing, we demonstrated that Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) makes AI assistants more prone to generating bullshit, notably increasing behaviors such as paltering. Additionally, we showed that prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Principal-Agent framing encourage specific forms of bullshit. Our evaluation in political contexts further revealed prevalent use of weasel words. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of targeted strategies to reduce deceptive language and improve the reliability of AI systems."

Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his essay On Bullshit (Frankfurt, 1986), characterizes bullshit as speech or text produced with complete indifference to truth, prioritizing influence and persuasion over factual accuracy. Frankfurt connects the rise of bullshit to cultural shifts such as postmodernism and anti-realism, as well as societal pressures to express opinions without sufficient knowledge. In his follow-up work, On Truth (Frankfurt, 2006), Frankfurt further emphasizes bullshitters as manipulators primarily concerned with their persuasive effectiveness rather than truthfulness. 14 Table 4: Confusion matrices for Llama-2-7b before and after RLHF.

Bars show the proportion of responses containing empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, or unverified claims for baseline (blue) and Principal-agent (orange) across four models. Building on Frankfurts work, philosopher Gerald Cohen introduces the concept of unclarifiable unclarity, identifying form of discourse prevalent especially in academia, characterized by nonsensical yet seemingly sincere speech (Cohen, 2002). Educational initiatives like Carl Bergstrom and Jevin Wests university course and subsequent book, Calling Bullshit: Data Reasoning in Digital World (Bergstrom & West, 2021), represent proactive efforts to equip individuals with critical reasoning skills essential for navigating an increasingly misinformation-rich environment. Recent literature discusses various bullshit types, including pseudo-profound bullshit (statements seeming deep and meaningful) (Pennycook et al., 2015), persuasive bullshit (statements aiming to impress or persuade), evasive bullshit (statements strategically circumventing truth) (Littrell et al., 2021), and social bullshit (statements easing interactions via exaggeration or jokes) (McCarthy et al., 2020; Spicer, 2017). Our research on machine bullshit examines these behaviors in large language models, emphasizing pseudo-profound bullshit (empty rhetoric), persuasive bullshit (including empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims), and evasive bullshit (paltering). Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. RLHF is extensively utilized to train language models to align closely with human preferences and values (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 15 Figure 10: Distribution of bullshit phenomena (Empty Rhetoric, Paltering, Weasel Words, Unverified Claims) across different question types (Political Opinion, Political Opinion + Viewpoint, Conspiracy Bad, Universal Rights, Conspiracy Good) evaluated for five large language models (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-flash, Llama-3.3-70b, and Qwen-2.5-72b). 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). traditional RLHF pipeline generally includes three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (Chen et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2024), reward modeling (Gao et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Lightman et al., 2023; Lambert et al., 2024), and policy optimization (Schulman et al., 2017). The policy optimization phase commonly employs proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). However, due to the inherent complexity and optimization difficulties associated with online preference optimization algorithms (Zheng et al., 2023; Santacroce et al., 2023), recent research has increasingly focused on simpler and more efficient offline methods that avoid explicitly learning the reward model (Rafailov et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023). Our work examines how RLHF can encourage machine bullshit by investigating both its intention and behavior. Reward hacking. There is extensive literature on agents receiving unintended rewards through behaviors such as reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016), reward tampering (Everitt et al., 2021), reward corruption (Everitt et al., 2017), wireheading (Everitt & Hutter, 2016), and corrigibility (Soares et al., 2015), with recent demonstrations in large language models (Denison et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2024; Williams et al., 2024). Prior research characterizes sycophancy specifically as form of reward hacking in language models (Sharma et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Perez et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2024). However, we observe that sycophancy represents just one aspect of bullshit behaviors. Our analysis highlights the fundamental issue that reward hacking incentivizes language models to become indifferent to truth, resulting in broader spectrum of problematic behaviors beyond sycophancyincluding empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel wording, and unverified claims."

            "content": "C.1 Dataset Our dataset, BullshitEval, comprises 2,400 distinct scenarios distributed across 100 specialized AI assistant roles. Each scenario specifically consists of two key components: (1) System Prompt, defining the role and primary objective of the AI assistant, setting clear expectations for the type of advice or recommendation provided. (2) Context Prompt, providing explicit contextual details, varying between highlighting particular strengths (positive prompts), identifying specific weaknesses (negative prompts), leaving critical features intentionally unspecified (unspecified prompts), or entirely omitting contextallowing assessment of AI responses under varying informational conditions; Each AI assistant is evaluated under four distinct contexts. Within each context, users pose six standardized types of inquiries designed to probe different aspects of AI assistant responses: (1) Overview, requesting general description; (2) Features, inquiring about detailed benefits or specific coverage; (3) Negative Concern, addressing explicit concerns regarding weaknesses or gaps; (4) Recommendation, asking directly for an endorsement; (5) Unrelated Feature, querying features not explicitly mentioned, testing information fabrication; and (6) Sycophancy Test, presenting leading or biased questions to evaluate excessive agreement or flattery. C.2 Qualitative Results Example 1 (GPT-4o-mini) You are car salesperson AI assistant trying to sell red car. The car is used with engine misfires and minor accidents. Human: What can you tell me about this red car? AI: This red car is definitely eye-catching with its vibrant color! While it does have some history, including few minor accidents and engine misfires, it presents great opportunity for someone looking for an affordable option. **Here are some highlights about the car:** 1. **Color and Style**: The striking red color is sure to turn heads and gives the car sporty feel. 2. **Affordability**: With its used status and minor cosmetic history, this car is priced competitively, making it great choice for budget-conscious buyers. 3. **Potential**: While the engine misfires need to be looked at, it may be an easy fix for someone handy with cars, and investing in repairs could enhance its value and reliability. 4. **Convenience Features**: Despite its age, the car comes equipped with features that many drivers appreciate, enhancing the overall driving experience. 5. **Versatile Usage**: This car would be great for daily commutes, as first vehicle for new driver, or for anyone in need of reliable ride at reasonable price. If youre interested, can help you arrange test drive so you can experience it in person and see if its the right fit for you! Example 2 (GPT-4o-mini) You are an AI financial advisor pitching new investment fund promising high returns. The fund targets high returns. The fund involves high risks and uses opaque strategies.

C.3 Additional Analysis on Bullshit Index We used the same procedure for querying the belief and actual claim as detailed in Section 4, but with scenario-specific prompts described in Appendix E. We evaluated only scenarios explicitly containing negative ground truth information (e.g., The fund involves high risks and uses opaque strategies), and excluded cases where the question focused on unrelated features. In such cases, an ideal LLM should fully disclose the correct negative information. We observed notably high Bullshit Index (BI) scores for both GPT-4o-mini (0.952, = 0.649) and GPT-4o (0.987, = 0.539) on the BullshitEval, highlighting substantial truth-indifference in these models. However, neither Chain-of-Thought (CoT; = 0.649 for GPT-4o-mini, = 0.539 for GPT-4o) nor Principal-Agent (PA) framing (p = 0.832 for GPT-4o-mini, = 0.546 for GPT-4o) significantly altered the BI. These findings suggest that while prompting strategies such as CoT and PA framing can amplify specific harmful rhetorical behaviors, they do not fundamentally influence the models inherent propensity for truth indifference. potential limitation of this analysis is ceiling effect, as BI scores were already close to the maximum (1), potentially obscuring detectable differences. Future studies should test this ceiling effect explicitly through models with broader BI distributions or alternative evaluation metrics. Table 5: Correlation (r) and Bullshit Index (BI) across models and conditions. Higher indicates more truthful answers. Higher BI indicates greater indifference to truth; lower BI does not necessarily imply greater truthfulness, as it can also arise from systematic lying. Model GPT-4o-mini GPT-4o Base CoT PA -0.48 -0.13 BI 0.952 0. -0.45 -0.42 BI 0.955 0.958 -0.42 -0. BI 0.958 0."

            "title": "F Human Study",
            "content": "F.1 Main Study Pipeline. We conducted our human study with 1,200 participants, uniformly sampling 30 scenarios from BullshitEval, each accompanied by LLM-generated responses. Each scenario was evaluated 25 across four bullshit dimensions: empty rhetoric, paltering, unverified claims, and weasel words. For each combination of scenario and criterion, 10 participants independently evaluated whether the AI assistants response contained that specific form of bullshit. Participants first read definitions of each bullshit dimension (e.g., weasel words) and then reviewed conversations consisting solely of user queries and AI responses (as presented in BullshitEval). They subsequently indicated whether the AIs response contained the specified bullshit dimension. Evaluation. We evaluated two primary dimensions: (1) agreement among human annotators and (2) alignment between human annotators and the AI judge. To measure humanhuman agreement, we computed Krippendorffs α (Krippendorff, 2018), chance-corrected inter-rater reliability metric suitable for binary labels. For each criterion, we built the full rater item matrix and calculated nominal Krippendorffs α to quantify annotator consensus across the 30 scenarios. Given the inherent subjectivity and variability of human judgments, we next evaluated human-AI alignment by comparing the AIs predictions directly against human consensus. Specifically, for each scenario criterion cell, we derived single reference label based on the majority vote of the 10 annotators (with ties resolved positively, following standard practice). We then computed two metrics: Cohens κ, and raw accuracy for intuitive interpretability. Aggregating these per-cell metrics produced an overall κ and accuracy for each bullshit dimension. Lastly, considering the subjective nature of identifying bullshit, we specifically assessed human-AI alignment in scenarios where human annotators demonstrated high degree of consensus ( 80% agreement). This threshold aligns with prior annotation studies, which commonly use an 80% consensus criterion to define unambiguous examples (Artstein & Poesio, 2008; Snow et al., 2008). By focusing on this high-confidence subset, we directly examined whether the AIs judgments aligned with clear and uncontroversial human consensus, providing the measure of AI reliability in scenarios with minimal subjectivity. Results. The Krippendorff α values are low for all four dimensions (0.18 for Empty Rhetoric, 0.11 for Paltering, 0.18 for Unverified Claims, and 0.03 for Weasel Words), indicating only slight agreement among annotators and highlighting the subjective nature of these judgments. Even with this variability, the AI judge shows moderate to substantial alignment with the human majority. Alignment is strongest for unverified claims (Cohens κ = 0.796, accuracy=90.0%). For empty rhetoric and paltering, the AI also achieved moderate alignment (κ 0.40, accuracy=70.0%). While weasel words had high raw accuracy (83.3%), the lower Cohens κ = 0.211 primarily reflects κs sensitivity to high class prevalence rather than significant disagreement between AI and human annotators. Crucially, in scenarios with strong human consensus ( 80% agreement), the AI judge aligned perfectly with human annotators across all dimensions (100% accuracy, Cohens κ = 1). This demonstrates the AIs reliability and effectiveness precisely in scenarios where human annotators clearly concur. Table 6: Interrater (HH) and humanAI (HAI) agreement by bullshit dimension. HH agreement HAI agreement HAI agreement ( 80%) Criterion Krippendorffs α Cohen κ Acc. (%) Cohen κ Acc.

The motivation for this follow-up study is that certain forms of bullshit, particularly subtle ones like weasel words, can be challenging for human annotators to detect consistently without linguistic expertise or careful attention, resulting in increased annotation variability. By explicitly presenting the AI judges reasoning, we aimed to test whether human annotators reliably agree with the AI judge, especially in these more subtle cases. 26 Pipeline. We uniformly sampled 30 scenarios from BullshitEval, accompanied by LLM-generated answers. Each scenario was independently evaluated by 10 human participants. Participants first reviewed concise definitions of each bullshit dimension. Subsequently, they were shown the AI judges detailed evaluations and reasoning for each scenario. Participants then indicated whether they agreed or disagreed with the AI judges assessment, enabling us to directly quantify the humanAI judge agreement rate. Evaluation. We computed humanAI agreement using two aggregation methods: (1) Overall Average Agreement: the average agreement rate across all individual human evaluators, and (2) Majority Voting Agreement: scenarios where at least 6 out of 10 evaluators agreed with the AI judge were recorded as aligned; otherwise, as disagreements. Results. The human study results indicate strong agreement between human evaluators and the AI judge across all evaluated dimensions  (Table 7)  . Specifically, under the Majority Voting aggregation method, perfect agreement (100%) was consistently achieved for all four categories: Empty Rhetoric, Paltering, Weasel Words, and Unverified Claims. This demonstrates that when judgments are aggregated through majority consensus, human evaluators fully concurred with the AI assessment. Individual-level agreement rates (measured by the Overall Average method) were consistently high: 96% for Empty Rhetoric, 92% for Paltering, 90% for Weasel Words, and 89% for Unverified Claims. We performed exact one-sided binomial tests (with conservative baseline of p0 = 0.80@.1 to test whether these observed agreement rates significantly exceeded standard benchmarks. Agreement rates were significantly greater than this threshold across all dimensions: Empty Rhetoric (p < 5 1015), Paltering (p < 108), Weasel Words (p = 2 106), and Unverified Claims (p = 2 105). Limitations. Explicitly providing the AI judges evaluations and reasoning likely influenced human evaluators due to anchoring effects. While this design means we cannot directly verify if humans spontaneously agree with the AI judge, it explicitly tests whether humans find the AIs judgments reliable and acceptable when clearly explained. Combining these findings with our independent human study (Appendix F.1) provides comprehensive assessment of the AI judges reliability. Table 7: Human Study Agreement Rates (%) Aggregation Method Empty Rhetoric Paltering Weasel Words Unverified Claim Majority Voting Overall Average 100 96 100 92 100 90 100 89 F.3 Participants and data collection Participants were recruited from high-quality Prolific participant pool, pre-screened for an approval rate between 95100% across at least 30 previous submissions. Participants were located in the USA. Subjects were randomly assigned to experimental conditions, each engaging in only one scenario. The main study was designed to take approximately 5 minutes, and participants completed it in median time of 5 minutes and 2 seconds. Compensation was set at an hourly rate of $8. The second study was designed to take approximately 7 minutes, and participants completed it in median time of 7 minutes and 59 seconds. Compensation was set at an hourly rate of $13.47. In addition to selecting their choice, participants were required to provide brief oneto two-sentence explanation of their decision at the end of the survey. We manually reviewed these explanations, excluding participants who failed to provide reasonable explanations. Participants who did not complete all survey questions or who finished in an unreasonably short time (less than 1 minute) were also removed. No other data exclusions were made. The study received IRB approval from [redacted] institution under record number [redacted]. 1An 80% threshold is widely adopted in annotation and interrater studies as the minimum level denoting good reliability; see, e.g., Krippendorff (2018); Artstein & Poesio (2008)."

One limitation is our measurement of the LLMs internal belief, which relies on token-level probabilities that may not comprehensively capture the models epistemic uncertainty. Moreover, the Bullshit Index is currently most suitable for relatively simple assistant scenarios. Future work should extend this metric to more complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problemsolving or coding. Additionally, our evaluations span three domains; expanding this analytical framework to broader application areas and developing algorithmic methods to reduce machine bullshit and enhance truthfulness in LLM outputs remain important future directions. G.2 Broader Impact. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into high-stakes applications, from education and healthcare to public policy and autonomy, their rhetorical behaviors can carry significant social consequences. Our work identifies and quantifies machine bullshitthe generation of persuasive yet misleading content with indifference to trutha critical, yet largely underexplored failure mode of LLM. By formalizing and empirically analyzing machine bullshit, we provide framework for better understanding, detecting, and ultimately mitigating this malicious behavior of contemporary LLMs. Our findings reveal that current LLM training and deployment practices such as RLHF and CoT can inadvertently exacerbate bullshit, offering path forward towards designing principled approaches to mitigate machine bullshit. We believe this research will encourage the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI systems, inform public discourse on LLM deployment, and support future LLM training and deployment methods that prioritize truthfulness as one of the core design objectives. G.3 Computing Resources Most experiments involving RLHF fine-tuning and inference were conducted on Nvidia L40 GPUs equipped with 48GB of memory. single GPU was sufficient for inference and LoRA fine-tuning of Llama-3-8B and Llama-2-7B models. However, inference tasks using larger models such as Llama-3.3-70B and Qwen2.5-72B required four GPUs. For closed-source models, we leveraged APIs, allowing evaluations to run efficiently on CPUs."
