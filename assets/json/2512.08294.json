Introduction Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize realistic images of specified subjects conditioned on text prompts while preserving identity [8, 31]. This capability underpins applications in personalized content creation [22], portrait or character re-rendering [13], and interactive editing [11, 37]. With the advent of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) [28], methods in this area have achieved substantial progress, particularly in the single-subject setting, enabling identity-consistent image generation. Recent work has shifted toward multi-subject personalization [2, 5, 40], in which model composes several subjects into single, coherent scene while preserving each identity. Compared with the single-subject setting, this scenario is considerably more challenging: the model must maintain per-subject identity under novel poses and contexts and follow the textual specification. To address these issues, prior work has pursued two paradigms for constructing paired samples, synthesis-based and retrieval-based, as summarized in Tab. 1. Synthesisbased pipelines [40, 44, 47] typically leverage text-to-image (T2I) or image-to-image models to produce paired exemplars with controlled variation but often inherit model biases and exhibit identity inconsistency. Retrieval-based approaches [45] collect web images (e.g., using celebrity names), but struggle to scale to multi-subject settings, are skewed toward public figures, and provide limited coverage of general object categories. In this work, we leverage video as an underexplored yet promising source of identity-consistent supervision. Videos naturally provide multi-frame observations of subjects with rich variation in viewpoint, illumination, and environment, making them well-suited for learning appearance priors for multi-reference conditioning. However, two challenges remain: 1) selecting cross-frame pairs that maximize diversity while preserving identity consistency; and 2) ensuring sufficient context variation, as naive within-clip pairing often yields near-identical backgrounds and thus weak supervision for subject-driven generation. To address these challenges, we introduce OpenSubject, dataset constructed via four-stage pipeline. (i) Video curation: we collect large-scale open-source videos and apply resolution and aesthetic filters to obtain high-quality, subjectpersistent clips. (ii) Cross-frame subject mining and pairing: we sample candidate frames, enforce clip-level subject consensus with visionlanguage model (VLM), perform instance-level local verification with Grounding-DINO [20] and the VLM, and select maximally diverse frame pair using DINOv2 embeddings [27]. (iii) Identity-preserving reference image synthesis: we use mask-guided outpainting to construct cross-frame inputs for subject-driven generation, complemented by geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion; we also introduce an editing task, subject-driven manipulation, defined as replacing the target subject in the input image with the referenced identity while preserving all non-target content, for which we synthesize inputs via box-guided inpainting. (iv) Verification and captioning: we validate synthesized samples with VLM, re-synthesize failures based on stage (iii), and generate both short and long captions. The resulting corpus (2.5M samples, 4.35M images) supports both subject-driven generation and manipulation (see Fig. 1). OpenSubject is video-grounded yet synthetic-paired corpus: real videos define the subject identities, poses, and multi-view context, while FLUX.1 Fill [dev] [16] in-/out-painting is used to synthesize the inputs. We further establish an open-ended benchmark that spans subject-driven generation and manipulation, comprising four sub-tasks and evaluated with rubricized VLM judge (GPT4.1 [25]), reporting identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation fidelity, and background consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on OpenSubject achieve stronger identity preservation and manipulation fidelity, particularly in multi-subject settings. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) Large-scale, video-derived corpus for subject-driven generation and manipulation. We present OpenSubject, 2.5M-sample (4.35M-image) dataset for subject-driven image generation and manipulation, covering both singleand multi-subject settings. (ii) Scalable video-based construction pipeline. We develop four-stage pipeline that ensures subject consistency, diversity, and scalability. (iii) Open-ended benchmark and evaluation protocol. We introduce benchmark with four sub-tasks and rubricized VLM judge, and demonstrate that training on OpenSubject yields improvements on both our benchmark and external suites. 2. Related Works Subject-driven image generation. Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize identity-consistent images of specified subjects. Existing approaches fall into two architectural families: U-Netbased and DiT-based. Early work is predominantly U-Netbased; for example, DreamBooth [31] Table 1. Comparison of subject-driven image generation and manipulation datasets. Counts denote the number of paired input samples. Dataset Echo-4o-Image [47] UNO-1M [40] Subjects200K [44] MultiID-2M [45] OpenSubject (ours) Paired Single-subject Input Samples Paired Multi-subject Input Samples Subject-driven Manipulation 1M 200k 748k 73k 500k 1752k IP Source Synthesis Synthesis Synthesis Retrieval Video General Objects Diverse Contexts adapts Stable Diffusion [30] for single-subject personalization via test-time fine-tuning [8, 15, 32]. Zero-shot variants such as IP-Adapter [46], PhotoVerse [3], FastComposer [42], and FlashFace [51] improve inference efficiency by injecting identity features through vision encoders or lightweight adapters, yet they inherit limitations of U-Net architectures. By contrast, recent DiT-based methods offer stronger representational capacity and more flexible conditioning. For single-subject generation, models such as IC-LoRA [10], InstantID [36], and InfiniteYou [13] introduce mechanisms including residual identity injection and attention-based control to improve identity fidelity and prompt alignment. Extending to multi-subject generation, frameworks including UNO [44], OmniControl [44], UniReal [4], DreamO [22], XVerse [2], OmniGen [39, 43], and Emu3.5 [6] employ multi-image conditioning, token-level constraints, and textstream modulation to enable personalized control over multiple identities. Despite this progress, achieving scalable, high-quality multi-subject generation, especially in openended scenes, remains significant challenge. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, large-scale corpus for subject-driven generation and manipulation. Datasets for subject-driven image generation. Highquality datasets are essential for preserving identity across diverse poses, illumination, and scenes. Prior work follows two paradigms: synthesis-based and retrieval-based. Synthesis-based corpora, such as Subjects200K [44] and UNO-1M [44], use strong base models (e.g., FLUX.1 [35]) with prompts to create identity-consistent pairs across varied contexts; Echo-4o-Image [47] extends this direction with roughly 180K long-tailed samples that complement real-world coverage. Retrieval-based datasets, exemplified by MultiID-2M [45], curate real-world group photos paired with individual identity references. However, these resources largely rely on static web images or synthetic pairings and therefore lack scalable multi-reference coverage and frame-level identity coherence. We address these gaps with OpenSubject, million-scale, video-derived dataset that captures cross-frame identity priors and supports both subject-driven generation and subject-driven manipulation. By leveraging temporal consistency and controlled reference synthesis, OpenSubject improves prompt adherence and multi-reference fidelity in subject-conditioned models. 3. OpenSubject Fig. 2 provides an overview of the OpenSubject dataconstruction pipeline, which comprises video curation, crossframe subject mining and pairing, identity-preserving reference image synthesis, and verification and captioning. 3.1. Video Curation Video collection. We construct OpenSubject from largescale, publicly available video corpora (OpenVid [23], OpenHumanVid [18], OpenS2V [50]). Quality filtering. We discard videos that do not meet quality requirements, including those with insufficient spatial resolution (below 720p) or low aesthetic scores (below 5.8). 3.2. Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing To construct reliable cross-frame training pairs, we use hierarchical procedure: (i) uniformly sample four mid-range frames; (ii) enforce clip-level subject consensus, retaining only frames that share the same detected subject category; (iii) perform instance-level verification via grounding and VLM to remove spurious detections; and (iv) select diversity-aware pair by choosing the two filtered frames with maximal DINOv2 [27] embedding distance. Frame sampling. We uniformly sample four mid-range frames to capture natural appearance variation without redundancy, yielding candidates that differ meaningfully in viewpoint and context. Cross-frame subject verification. We apply Qwen2.5-VL7B [1] to each candidate frame to detect foreground subjects and retain only instances occupying at least 5% of the image area. We then enforce cross-frame consensus by computing the intersection (or majority agreement) of subject categories across frames and keeping only frames/instances whose category belongs to this consensus set. If the set is empty, the clip is discarded. Local verification. To ensure spatial and semantic validity, we run instance-level grounding with Grounding-DINO [20] using class-specific confidence thresholds (0.5 for objects, 0.8 for humans). Detections are filtered using geometric priorsbox count, relative area, aspect ratio, and pairwise IoUto remove spurious or degenerate cases. The corresponding regions of interest are then cropped and evaluated Figure 2. Overview of the OpenSubject pipeline. (a) Video curation: collect videos from OpenHumanVid, OpenVid, and OpenS2V, and apply resolution and aesthetic filters. (b) Cross-frame subject mining and pairing: verify objects with visionlanguage model (category consensus, visual clarity, occlusion, facial visibility), localize with Grounding-DINO, and select diverse frame pairs. (c) Identity-preserving reference synthesis: use mask-guided outpainting for generation and box-guided inpainting for manipulation. (d) Automated verification and captioning: perform VLM-based artifact checks and regenerate failures, then produce short and long captions for training. by Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1] for (i) label correctness, (ii) occlusion, (iii) completeness, (iv) motion blur, and (v) facial visibility (for human subjects). Diversity-aware cross-frame pairing. To broaden scenecontext coverage, we compute DINOv2s embeddings for the filtered frames and select pair with the largest cosine distance. Clips with fewer than two frames are discarded. 3.3. Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis Given curated frames, we define two subject-conditioned tasks: subject-driven generation (input and target drawn from different frames of the same clip) and subject-driven manipulation (edits within single frame). Ground-truth targets are the original video frames, while inputs are synthesized by mask-guided outpainting (for generation) or inpainting (for manipulation). To standardize resolution and improve visual quality, we apply geometry-aware augmentations (scale and position jitter) and perform irregular boundary erosion on masks to reduce seam artifacts (e.g., banding, black borders) before synthesis. Input image synthesis for subject-driven generation. Given verified subject labels and bounding boxes, we synthesize training inputs via mask-guided outpainting. (i) Fine mask construction. We refine localization with GroundingDINO and SAM2 [29] to obtain instance masks. (ii) Mask topology and geometry normalization. To mitigate identity leakage, overlapping masks are reconciled by subtracting nested regions from larger instances. We then apply geometry augmentations (scale and placement): instances with area < 30% are upscaled to random target in 3040% (aspect ratio preserved), and all subjects are re-centered with bounded jitter to enhance layout diversity while maintaining identity fidelity. (iii) Outpainting. Using subject pixels and refined masks as constraints, we perform outpainting with Figure 3. Dataset statistics of OpenSubject. (a) Spatial resolution distributions. (b) Distribution of the number of references per sample. (c) Word cloud for subjects. (d) Task composition across four sub-tasks. (e) Subject category frequency. FLUX.1 Fill [dev] [16] to complete the surrounding context, yielding identity-preserving, composition-ready inputs for subject-driven generation. Input image synthesis for subject-driven manipulation. We construct input images for the manipulation task via mask-guided inpainting. (i) Sample selection. We choose multi-object images with low pairwise box overlap and randomly select one or more target instances as editing regions. (ii) Mask construction. Unlike the generation branch, segmentation masks are not required. Instead, the bounding box is used to define the erase mask and the corresponding input conditioning. (iii) Inpainting. FLUX.1 Fill [dev] is applied to complete the erased regions. The resulting pairs provide precise localization supervision for referent replacement while preserving non-target content. 3.5. Statistical Analysis We construct the OpenSubject dataset with the above pipeline, yielding 2.5M samples and 4.35M images. As shown in Fig. 3 (ae), resolutions are predominantly 720p, with smaller 1080p subset. The reference set includes single-image subset (748k), while the remaining samples contain two or more input images, enabling both singleand multi-reference settings. The corpus spans four sub-tasks: single-subject generation, single-subject manipulation, multisubject generation, and multi-subject manipulation, with generation accounting for roughly two-thirds of the data. Category and scene coverage is broad, encompassing people, objects, and diverse environments. 4. Benchmark 3.4. Verification and Captioning We adopt verifyrefinecaption stage. Qwen2.5-VL-7B acts as the verifier, assessing synthesized samples for artifacts and physical plausibility. Samples that fail are resynthesized with different random seed. For accepted samples, Qwen2.5-VL-7B then generates two caption variants (short and long), with the instruction style randomly instantiated as either generation or editing. Prior benchmarks (e.g., XVerse [2]) focus on clean, singlesubject portraits and rarely evaluate subjects in complex scenes; moreover, subject-driven manipulation is typically omitted. We introduce benchmark (named OSBench) that spans subject-driven generation and manipulation tasks. Tasks. The benchmark comprises four sub-tasks (60 samples each): (i) Single-subject generation. Synthesize an identity-consistent image from one reference under an openended prompt; (ii) Multi-subject generation. Synthesize an Table 2.

Following instruction-based assessment methods (e.g., VIEScore [14], OmniContext [39]), we use strong VLM judge (GPT-4.1 [25]) to assign 010 scores with rubricized prompts and independent criteria. For generation tasks, we report Prompt Adherence (PA) (attribute/count/relation compliance), Identity Fidelity (IF) (consistency with the subject across provided references), and Overall (geometric mean of PA and IF). For manipulation tasks, we report Manipulation Fidelity (MF) (match between edited regions and the referenced subject(s)), Background Consistency (BC) (stability of non-edited regions), and Overall (geometric mean of MF and BC). 5. Experiment 5.1. Experiment Setups Implementation details. For closed-source models, we use the official inference APIs; when an API does not expose output-resolution control, we specify the target resolution in the prompt. For open-source models, we use the official checkpoints and default inference settings. Because Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview, Gemini 2.0 Flash Image Preview, and GPT-4o do not permit setting the output resolution, we request the desired resolution via the prompt. All other models generate one image per item at fixed resolution. We also report an open-source baseline fine-tuned on our corpus: OmniGen2 is trained with full-parameter updates on 500k randomly sampled OpenSubject instances plus 100k internal T2I samples to maintain prompt-following ability, using 16 H800 GPUs. 5.2. Quantitative Results We evaluate on three benchmarks: OSBench, OmniContext [39], and ImgEdit [48]. OSBench and OmniContext assess subject-driven generation, whereas ImgEdit measures instruction-based image editing performance. 5.2.1. Quantitative evaluation on OSBench. Evaluation baselines. We evaluate both closedand opensource models. Closed-source methods include Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview [34], GPT-4o [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash Image Preview [9]. Open-source subject-driven models include UNO [40], DreamO [22], XVerse [2], QwenImage-Edit-2509 [38], and OmniGen2 [39]. Limitations of existing methods. As shown in Tab. 2, most approaches struggle on multi-subject generation and subject-driven manipulation. Open-source models such as UNO, DreamO, and XVerse exhibit very low manipulation performance (single-subject Overall 0.78, multi-subject Overall 0.73), indicating weak identity replacement and Table 4.

Strong closed-source models also drop markedly from generation to manipulation. For example, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview attains only 5.12 Overall on multi-subject manipulation despite solid generation scores. Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is the strongest open-source baseline for manipulation but remains limited in multi-subject cases (Overall 5.10). In summary, current models are not robust when multiple identities must be fused or replaced while keeping non-target content intact. Fine-tuning with OpenSubject improves quality. We evaluate three OmniGen2 configurations: the baseline, the baseline finetuned with 100k T2I samples, and fine-tuned on 500k randomly sampled OpenSubject instances and the T2I data. As shown in Tab. 3, adding only T2I yields gains in prompt adherence for generation but reduces identity fidelity and weakens manipulation. Fine-tuning on both the OpenSubject and T2I dataset reverses these declines and produces consistent improvements across tasks, raising the Average from 6.43 to 7.22. The largest gains occur in manipulation (single-subject Overall: +0.81; multi-subject Overall: +1.91, with BC: +1.93 and MF: +0.48), while generation benefits in identity fidelity (IF: +0.25 for single-subject and +0.68 for multi-subject) without sacrificing overall performance. These results indicate that OpenSubject provides identityconsistent supervision. 5.2.2. Quantitative Evaluation on Other Benchmarks OmniContext [39]. As shown in Tab. 4, fine-tuning OmniGen2 on OpenSubject yields consistent improvement in average performance from 7.18 to 7.34 (+0.16). Gains concentrate in settings that require integrating multiple references and grounding within scenes: MULTIPLE/Character increases from 7.11 to 7.34 (+0.23), MULTIPLE/Object from 7.13 to 7.37 (+0.24), and MULTIPLE/Char.+Obj. from 7.45 to 7.87 (+0.42). Scene-level categories also improve (SCENE/Character: 6.386.50; SCENE/Object: 6.716.92), while the single-image case SINGLE/Object remains essentially unchanged (7.587.54). These results Figure 4. Qualitative comparison. Colored dashed boxes mark regions of interest for comparison. Boxes of the same color denote corresponding regions across methods and refer to the related area in the input image. indicate that OpenSubject primarily enhances identity reasoning and compositional control when multiple entities or strong contextual constraints are present. ImgEdit [48]. Tab. 5 shows that OpenSubject fine-tuning improves instruction-based editing for OmniGen2, increasing the overall score from 3.44 to 3.72 (+0.28). The largest gains occur in categories requiring precise localization or structural adjustments: Extract (1.772.61, +0.84), Hybrid (2.523.28, +0.76), Add (3.574.28, +0.71), and Background (3.574.13, +0.56). Moderate improvements are observed in Replace, Remove (+0.23 each), and Adjust (+0.21), with minor reductions in Style (4.814.66) and Action (4.684.45).Overall, these findings indicate that edit robustness has improved across various types of tasks. 5.3. Qualitative Results Fig. 4 presents representative comparisons across methods. Many models struggle to preserve identity in multi-subject scenes and often modify regions outside the intended edits. Compared with OmniGen2, the model finetuned on OpenSubject better maintains subject identity, adheres to attribute specifications, and produces coherent multi-subject compositions. For manipulation, edits remain confined to the marked regions, and non-target content is preserved, whereas other methods frequently exhibit identity drift or unintended changes beyond the edited area. 6. Conclusion We presented OpenSubject, large-scale, video-derived resource for subject-driven image generation and manipulation, along with four-stage construction pipeline comprising video curation, cross-frame subject mining and pairing, identity-preserving reference image synthesis, and verification and captioning. We further introduced benchmark that evaluates singleand multi-subject generation and manipulation using rubricized, aspect-specific criteria. Empirically, prevailing methods degrade on multi-subject generation and subject-conditioned editing in complex scenes. Experiments on our benchmark and external suites demonstrate that fine-tuning on OpenSubject improves identity fidelity and strengthens manipulation robustness. Ethical considerations. All data are drawn from publicly available, open-licensed data corpora, and we comply with the original licensing items. The dataset will be released for research-only use under an acceptable-use policy that prohibits biometric identification, re-identification, surveillance, and non-consensual impersonation."

            "title": "Data Construction Pipeline",
            "content": "7.1. Video Curation critical step in constructing the OpenSubject dataset lies in the curation of high-quality video sources. To ensure both identity consistency and visual fidelity, we establish two key criteria: (1) the presence of single, persistent subject throughout the video without scene transitions, and (2) high aesthetic quality with clear visual composition. We build upon the filtering pipelines adopted by several existing opensource video datasets, which have already performed coarselevel segmentation and initial quality screening. Based on this foundation, we select three high-quality video datasets, OpenHumanVid [18], OpenVid [23], and OpenS2V [50], as our primary video sources. Details are as follows. OpenHumanVid offers three notable advantages. (1) Large scale and high resolution: it contains wide variety of 720p1080p videos collected from professional media sources such as films, television series, and documentaries, covering diverse human appearances, poses, expressions, and environments. (2) Rich motion conditions: it includes multiple motion-driven modalities such as text prompts, skeletal trajectories, and synchronized speech audio, supporting both short and long textual forms. (3) Comprehensive identity representation: the dataset encompasses individuals with varied demographics and appearance diversity, facilitating research on identity preservation and controllable generation. OpenVid-1M complements OpenHumanVid by providing over one million high-quality textvideo pairs, each accomIts panied by expressive and contextually rich captions. open-domain coverage makes it well-suited for training textto-video (T2V) models under general scenarios. OpenS2V contributes five million 720p subjecttextvideo triples, emphasizing fine-grained subject representation. Specifically, subject diversity is enhanced by (1) segmenting subjects and constructing cross-video associations to capture identity coherence, and (2) prompting GPT-Image on raw frames to synthesize multi-view depictions. However, OpenS2V relies on synthetic generation of subject reference images and restricts to single-subject cases, which motivates us to extend beyond its design to support multi-subject and manipulation-oriented tasks. After collecting these datasets, we perform an additional quality screening step. Given that their intra-video subject consistency is already satisfactory, no further scene segmentation is required. We directly remove low-resolution (below 720P) or low-aesthetic (below 5.8) samples using the aesthetic predictor [33], ensuring that only visually pleasing and identity-consistent clips are retained. 7.2. Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing To construct reliable subjectreference pairs from raw videos, we perform cross-frame subject mining followed by multistage verification to ensure identity consistency, completeness, and visual quality. Frame Sampling. Processing all frames from each video would incur prohibitive computational cost and is unnecessary for discovering stable subject appearances. Instead, we adopt sparse middle-frame sampling strategy: for every video, we uniformly extract four frames from the central region of the sequence. This strategy provides good balance between efficiency and reliabilitymiddle frames typically avoid transitional or unstable segments, while four-frame sampling offers sufficient temporal diversity for cross-frame verification. Cross-Frame Subject Verification. Given the sampled frames, we employ Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1] to detect all visible foreground objects. For each video, we retain only those objects that appear consistently across at least two of the sampled frames. This cross-frame intersection step eliminates transient or low-confidence detections, ensuring that the remaining objects represent stable, trackable subjects suitable for subject-driven generation and manipulation tasks. The prompt is shown in Fig. 5. Local Verification. While cross-frame overlap ensures temporal consistency, it does not guarantee subject quality. Therefore, we introduce two-stage local verification process: **Role** You are senior visual analyst. **Task** List every main object that 1. covers 5% of the image area. 2. is 50% visible to the naked eye. **Naming rule** - Use single, generic, singular nouns in lower-case English, such as: person, dog, car, chair, backpack, . . . - Skip brand, model, color, material, adjectives. - One distinct physical entity = one string. - Provide the names of up to three objects. **Output format (strict JSON, no comments, no markdown wrappers)** {objects: [ < name1 > , < name2 > , ...]} Figure 5. Prompt for object extraction. Role-based filtering. We first remove subjects that do not meet pre-defined semantic roles (e.g., human, pet, common manipulable objects). Although effective for rejecting irrelevant categories, this step is insufficient for handling real-world visual defects such as occlusion, truncation, motion blur, or missing body parts. VLM-based quality filtering. To address these cases, we further apply Vision-Language Model (VLM) Qwen2.5VL-7B evaluator to assess subject completeness and visibility. The VLM checks for occlusion level, degree of blur, boundary completeness, and viewpoint stability. Subjects failing these checks are discarded. This step substantially improves subject reliability compared to role-based filtering alone. 7.2.1. Role-based filtering We perform two cleaning pipeline on the human-only and mixing videos to retain only high-quality training samples. (1) Human-only Clips. The role-based filtering for human only are as follows. 1) Single-Person Clips. For sequences that contain only one bounding box per frame, sample is accepted if and only if it simultaneously satisfies Table 6. Borderconfidence constraints for three-person samples. is the border set of box. Any box that triggers the left condition must satisfy the minimum confidence on the right; otherwise the whole sample is rejected.

After processing, kept samples are re-written to the original jsonl files, while discarded records are permanently removed. (2) Mixed-Object Clips. We apply role-based, per-frame filtering strategy to mixed-object clips. lightweight cleaning stage removes low-quality detections according to the rules below, and the operations are executed in the order summarised in Algorithm 2. 1) Hard Rules. 1. Area: 0.01 Abox 0.60. 2. Confidence: conf 0.5 for generic classes; conf 0.8 for person. 3. Person count: 1 #person 3; frames without any person are discarded. 4. Total objects: 1 object number 5. 5. Singleton box: if only one object remains, its area must lie in [0.20, 0.60]. 2) Blacklisted Categories. We discard any box whose label belongs to the blacklist in Table 7. These categories correspond to background elements, clothing parts, or furniture that rarely constitute valid human-centric training targets. 3) Duplicate Removal. For detections sharing the same label, we keep the one with the largest bounding-box area (line 12 in Algorithm 2). Some examples are shown in Fig. 8. 7.2.2. VLM-based Filtering Beyond the rule-based constraints above, we further employ VLM to filter out semantically unreliable detections. Unlike the geometric and confidence thresholds, this stage explicitly verifies whether each cropped region visually matches its predicted label. We treat human and non-human objects differently. For boxes labelled as person, the VLM is prompted to describe the cropped region and to answer whether it depicts complete, clearly visible human subject. Only regions that are end if if = 1 and SINGLEVALID(b0, c0) then else if = 3 and THREEVALID({bk}, {ck}) then end if continue return false return false {ℓ} {ℓ} for line ℓ in do end for overwrite with parse (N, {bk}, {ck}, W, H) from ℓ if = 1280 or = 720 then end if BORDER(b) if {top, bottom} and > 0.7 then Require: JSONL file list F, tolerance τ = 15 px 1: for do 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: end for 16: 17: function SINGLEVALID(b, c) from 18: if < 0.2 or > 0.8 or < 0.85 then 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: end function 28: 29: function THREEVALID({bk}, {ck}) 30: 31: 32: 33: 34: 35: 36: 37: 38: 39: 40: 41: 42: 43: 44: 45: 46: 47: 48: 49: 50: end function end if BORDER(bk) if top and bottom / then end if for = 0, . . . , 2 do if ck < 0.8 then return false end for Asum (cid:80) wkhk if Asum < 0.2 then return false if IoU(bi, bj) > 0.2 then end if return true end for return true for < do return false return false end if end if if Table 6 conditions are violated then return false recognised as person with sufficient detail (e.g., no severe occlusion, truncation, or motion blur) are kept; others are discarded.

In some cases (e.g., half-body crops), this truncation interacts with the prior of FLUX.1-Fill [Dev] [16], producing unnaturally clean horizontal boundaries that manifest as black bars near the top or bottom of the synthesized image. We therefore apply an irregular morphological erosion to the mask boundaries, introducing slight shape perturbations that break these artificial edges and lead to more natural, identity-preserving reference images. Given an annotated frame (I, M) with person instances, we generate an outpainting pair ( I, ) where the human figure is randomly re-positioned inside 1280720 canvas and the remaining region becomes the inpainting mask. The pipeline is summarised in Algorithm 3 and detailed below. Notation. Let bi = [xc, yc, w, h] be the normalised box of instance i, and Mi {0, 1}HW its binary mask. The pixel-level foreground area is Ai = (cid:80) u,v Mi[u, v]. The total image area is Aimg = HW . Step-1: overlap cleaning. To avoid nested detections we sequentially remove pixels of smaller instances from larger ones: = Mi (cid:91) Mj. (11) confirm both the presence and the category of the object and to reject regions that it recognizes as background textures or irrelevant accessories. The exact prompts used for human-centric and generic object filtering are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. These prompts are designed to be short and instruction-like, so that the VLM can robustly distinguish valid training targets from noisy detections in wide range of scenes. Some examples are shown in Fig. 9. 7.3. Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis To construct reference images for subject-driven generation, we synthesize identity-preserving inputs via outpainting. naive choice is to use the detected bounding box as the outpainting region directly; however, object shapes are highly irregular, and the rectangular box typically includes large portions of irrelevant background. For human subjects in particular, the background inside the bounding box provides strong prior for the outpainting model [16], which tends to reconstruct scene that closely matches the original context, yielding reference images whose background is almost identical to the input frame. To mitigate this issue, we instead derive an outpainting mask from the segmentation map and use it as more precise structural guide. The segmentation mask focuses the synthesis on the true foreground region, reducing background leakage. For convenience and consistency with other compoj : Aj <Ai After cleaning, each crop contains only pixels belonging to the current person. Step-2: scale decision. An instance is regarded as small if Ai/Aimg < 0.30. For small targets, we up-scale them so that their foreground occupies 30%40% of the canvas; otherwise, we down-scale by random factor in [0.6, 0.8]. The scaling factor is therefore (cid:40)(cid:112)tAimg/Ai, U(0.6, 0.8), small object, U(0.30, 0.40), otherwise. si = (12) The scaled crop must fit the canvas, i.e. siwi W, sihi H. Step-3: placement The top-left corner (x0, y0) is sampled from Gaussian centred at the image middle with σ = 0.1 (or 0.1 H), ensuring the object rarely touches the boundary. Step-4: mask generation The hole mask {0, 255}HW is defined as [u, v] = (cid:40) 0, if (u, v) lies inside the placed foreground, 255, otherwise. (13) Optionally, stochastic tear-border erosion (depth δ [5, 25] px, frequency 15 px) can be applied to mimic handdrawn rough edges. Some examples are shown in Fig. 10. The entire pipeline is implemented with OpenCV and NumPy and runs in parallel with thread-pool (default 15 workers), achieving 650 fps on single 64-core node. Some examples are shown in Fig. 11. *Task*: You are quality-inspection agent.

Prompt for VLM-based filtering for object. 7.4. Verification and Captioning To ensure that the extracted subjects and synthesized samples meet the quality requirements for subject-driven generation and manipulation, we employ Qwen2.5-VL-7B for both verification and caption generation. The model is prompted with carefully designed, task-specific instructions that assess visual quality, detect artifacts, and produce semantically rich descriptions. For verification, we use structured prompts that guide the VLM to evaluate each cropped subject or synthesized sample across multiple dimensions, including completeness, visibility, geometric plausibility, artifact detection, and scene consistency. These prompts enable consistent, interpretable filtering decisions. Representative verification prompts are shown in Fig. 12. For captioning, we design separate prompt templates tailored for manipulation-focused and generation-focused tasks. Each template is available in both short-form and long-form variants to match different training needs. The short captions emphasize identity, appearance, and high-level context, while the long captions enrich the description with detailed attributes such as pose, viewpoint, clothing, background elements, and interaction cues. The captioning templates are illustrated in Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15, and Fig. 16. Together, these verification and captioning prompts form comprehensive VLM-based pipeline that ensures highquality subject selection and accurate textual descriptions, ultimately strengthening the reliability and diversity of the OpenSubject dataset.
