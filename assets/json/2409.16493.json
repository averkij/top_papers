            "title": "1 INTRODUCTION\nEffective notetaking is crucial for capturing and organizing in-\nformation, allowing users to record essential details for later re-\nview. Whether in academic, professional, or personal settings, notes\nhelp individuals track important points, revisit information when\nneeded, and maintain focus on the task at hand without getting\noverwhelmed by the flow of information. However, notetaking can\nbe very challenging in a fast-paced environment, such as when\nwatching information-dense videos or videos that are difficult to\npause. Users may struggle with the high mental demands, forcing\nthem to divide their attention between absorbing new content and\ndocumenting it [30, 63, 64]. For example, when taking notes from\ninformation-dense videos, people often pause the video frequently\nin order to write notes, which disrupts the natural flow of content\nengagement [9] and forces the user to dedicate mental and physical\neffort to the mechanical act of notetaking. The inability to pause\n(e.g. in some live-streamed content or content on platforms that\nlack full media controls) adds even more pressure, often resulting in\nincomplete notes that may be difficult to interpret later [19, 34, 47]",
            "content": "\"The more content you try to capture during lecture or meeting, the less youre thinking about whats being said. You burn through most of your attention parroting the source.\" - Ryder Carroll [10] With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs,) people have explored building automated notetaking tools, such as NoteGPT [54, 55, 58]. These tools typically work by automatically generating notes or summaries from the video transcript or live lecture recordings in one go. Thus, the generated notes lack personalization [6]. For example, the notes may be too general and not tailored to the users specific needs. user may only be interested in specific topics of the material, or they might prefer their notes to be written in particular style that reflects how they process information. Automated notes can feel impersonal and robotic [6]. Prior studies have observed that, in fast-paced notetaking situations, people often resort to shorthand techniques like micronotes[43]. For example, they may jot down short keypoints containing shortened words or informational notations in order to write things down more quickly (see Figure 1a). However, while micronotes help users keep up with the pace, they are often too brief or vague to be useful during the later review. As result, these micronotes are often abandoned and not revisited [37]. Thus, we observed gap between quickly capturing information and having detailed, meaningful notes that can be revisited with clarity. In this work, we leverage the practice of micro-notetaking and build an assistive tool around this practice, specifically for videos. Video content presents unique challenge for notetaking due to its temporal nature and often being information-dense, which leaves little time for users to capture important details. We introduce NoTeeline1, an interactive notetaking assistance tool that aims to automatically expand user micronotes into complete notes in realtime that also aligns with their personal writing style. We propose novel pipeline that leverages window of the video transcript as well as handful of examples of the users previous notes. Through within-subjects user study, we found that NoTeeline helps users effectively capture notes with minimal disruption (e.g., reduced video pauses), capturing more content using fewer words and shorter time compared to manual notetaking baseline. Participants rate the generated note expansions as high quality (average 6.0 on 7point Likert scale, higher is better), align with the participants micronote content (relatively high semantic similarity between micronotes and expanded notes measured with SBERT score [66]), are consistent with participants writing style (8.33% improvement in chi-squared Distance [36]), and the notes contain low hallucination (93.2% factual correctness score measured with HHEM score [80]). In summary, this work makes the following contributions. (1) We designed NoTeeline, an interactive notetaking tool built around the concept of micronotes. NoTeeline helps users write quick notes in fast-paced contexts and utilizes LLMs to expand micronotes into full-fledged notes. (2) We conducted within-subjects user study to evaluate the performance and utility of NoTeeline. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that with NoTeeline, users can take high-quality notes with higher efficiency and satisfaction, compared to manual notetaking baseline."

            "title": "2 RELATED WORKS\n2.1 Tools for Supporting Active Notetaking\nActive notetaking has been long practiced as an efficient strategy\nto store and retain information [4, 62]. Past research has intro-\nduced several interactive notetaking tools to support live-notes\nwriting [26, 27, 45, 77, 79, 81], inking [9, 20, 92], information scaf-\nfolding [5, 74] and note organization [25, 49, 70, 73]. NoteLook\nsupports multimedia note taking in meetings in an integrated con-\nference room [13]. VideoSticker proposes a visual notetaking tool\nfor lecture videos utilizing object symbols to create multimodal,\nnon-linear notes [9]. AQuA introduces a question-answering inter-\nface that helps users to watch software tutorial videos to get quick\ninformation [85]. Livenote allows students to take lecture notes and\nannotate lecture slides cooperatively [35]. NoteLink allows students\nto link their hand-written notes with the relevant video so that they\ncan replay it easily [71]. Although these tools help users to organize\nand link source materials faster, users still have to write the whole\nnote manually, often requiring additional laborious revisions and\nmanual effort, causing a significant cognitive barrier [64]. On the\ncontrary, NoTeeline focuses on automatically generating the text\nof full notes from micronotes to shift effort from text notation to\ncapturing key ideas during active notetaking with users’ own note\npoints.",

P7 details the additional difficulties imposed by being non-native English speaker. P11 finds it challenging to take notes while listening to podcasts, especially during physical activities like running on treadmill. They describe the cumbersome process to jot down: have to slow down.. and then type it down in [a few words]... then again need to speed up the treadmill and continue. The user emphasizes how the ad hoc nature of this process complicates effective notetaking, making it difficult to capture details in real time. C2. Lack of agency in AI-assisted notetaking tools (𝑛 = 6). Users expressed the desire to maintain agency over AI-assisted notetaking tools. This is important given concerns about LLM hallucinating non-existent content [32]. P1 says would, at the end of the day, want some kind of source of truth... based on what the notes are going to be. They reported to prefer using automated note features as compliment to whatever that [theyre] using while always going to take [their] notes no matter how, because of the lack of trust in it. P2 further explains her thought - hope its tool for me... to help me get better understanding of the video, not tool for me to tell me what should know because still want myself to have the control of what the tool is doing. C3. Complex features and workflow of current tools. (𝑛 = 7). Participants highlighted that the complex features and fragmented workflow of current notetaking tools often hinder usability. One common challenge involved managing two separate applicationsone for watching videos and another for taking noteswhich made the Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Faria Huq, Abdus Samee, David Chuan-en Lin, Xiaodi Alice Tang, and Jeffrey P. Bigham process cumbersome. They expressed desire for having notetaking features within the video application, as this would facilitate more seamless interaction, especially if the notes are linked to specific video segments to aid in later review. Furthermore, participants reported that the overwhelming nature of feature-rich tools like Notion discouraged full utilization. As P5 described, dont end up using the extent of features that Notion has to offer... its so overwhelming .. so [I prefer] simple interface but with the ability that as you go forward, you can start to explore more. In other words, the features are not well-situated or contextualized within the workflow, and presenting them all at once can overwhelm users, preventing them from fully utilizing the benefits."

The tool should support the quick creation of micronotes and be able to automatically expand it into full note so that users do not need to write down all the details (C1). Even if the micronote includes grammatical errors or is extremely short, the system should be able to comprehend it. While transforming micronotes, it should be aware of the context, i.e., the topic being discussed in the video. The system should also support iterative editing of micronotes. D2. Maintain consistency with users writing style and preferences to ensure user agency. The system should take into account the specific writing styles of the user and remain consistent with their personal style. At the same time, the final note should exclude information users are not interested in and should not include any hallucinated information (C2). D3. Each component is linked to specific stage of the notetaking process to enhance ease of use. The system should link each component to specific stage in the notetaking processcreation, editing, and revision. It should allow users to engage selectively with these features based on the current stage, providing ease of use throughout the notetaking process (C3)[52, 61]."

            "content": "Micronote Expansion. To construct the full note, we have an atomic expansion operation. For expansion, we utilize these pieces of information in the prompt: micronote, video transcript where the micronote was written, and reference examples from onboarding. The transcript helps to infer abbreviated symbols and fix potential typographical errors (D1) [78]. Reference examples help to understand users writing style (D2). Figure 3 shows an example of micronote expansion. Note Organization by Theme. To rearrange the note points by emerging themes, we have an atomic order by theme operation. To order by theme, we pass the generated notes to the LLM and instruct it to return the output in structured, parseable format by using the few-shot prompting technique [33, 56]. We refer users to view the corresponding prompt Figure 14 in the Appendix to learn more about the structure we chose to use. Figure 4 shows an example of how the note organization operation works. Note Modification. To edit individual micronotes or the expanded output from LLM and/or the automatically generated theme name (D3), users can click on the button next to each point. Note Rearrangement. To enable users rearrange their notes (D3), we have drag and drop operation. Users can drag individual note points and reposition them under different theme using this operation. Users can also revert the note to its original serial by order by time operation. Cue Question Generation. To enable users review their notes, we have Cue Question Generation operation, which generates 5 questions on-the-fly. If users want new questions, they have the option to initiate Regeneration operation, which generates five new questions. The cue column is hidden by default to provide more space for writing to the users (D3). Cue question is generated in similar structured fashion to order by theme operation. Please view the corresponding prompt (Figure 15) in the Appendix for details. Summary Generation. To generate personalized summary, we have Summarize operation. The generated summary needs to reflect the users note as well as the video context (D2). Hence, we passed the full video transcript and expanded the note to LLM for the summary."

They were divided into four subgroups to counterbalance and mitigate any ordering bias. Table 3 shows the distribution of participants across these subgroups. User Study Procedure. We first gave an overview of the study procedures to the participants. Participants were given the NoTeeline web app link to browse from their laptops. They began with the onboarding session where we collected their personalized writing examples (B.1). After onboarding, participants were given two videos (B.2) to watch and take notes under the two study conditions. To prevent potential fatigue, participants were given 5-minute break in between each video. After each video notetaking session, users were asked to complete questionnaire [7, 24, 68]. Finally, we asked participants to try out NoTeeline with video of their choice. Each session was one hour long. Baseline. To compare NoTeeline with baseline, i.e., basic notes app, we used simplified view of our interface by hiding all advanced features (i.e., the synthesis functions described in 5.1.3). This setting mimics the standalone Macbook Notes app, which most of the participants reported using. We also want to compare the utility between the personalized summary in NoTeeline and the automatically generated summary in existing tools. Hence, we kept the summary feature in the baseline which is similar to NoteGPT [54], i.e., summary that is not conditioned on user notes, rather just summarizes the video transcript."

This also helps users to deeply concrete without disrupting their focus by pausing or rewinding. P4 directly speaks to this advantage: felt like had to.. take every note [in Baseline].. you saw me like pause and rewind... Whereas in [NoTeeline], felt like could just watch it all the way through and not have to rewind. The higher frequency of notes also shows that NoTeeline does not hinder the notetaking process in any way, rather it helps them to write it with less effort."

Eight participants also specifically remarked that the expanded note reflected their writing style. P11 says If my note was seven words or eight words then it went like one and half lines if mine was small and then it was also like not trying to bring in too much content so that felt it was trying to match with my style of what Im trying to put. Impact of Generated Themes. 11 out of 12 participants reviewed some aspects of the generated themes positively. P8 believes the impact of Order by Theme would become more evident in longer videos. P10 discusses how it would have greater impact in video with more discursive content. In that regard, P11 expresses excitement about using the Order by Theme in such context where the conversation may not usually flow through on one topic. Five reviews specifically point out the utility of the Order by Theme feature for aiding the review, retrieval, and organization of content. Impact of Cue Questions. 11 out of 12 participants reviewed some aspects of the cue questions positively, with critical feedback from five participants tending to focus on increased cue question complexity. P9 identified that multiple choice questions may not be applicable for concepts [that] are more open to interpretation. Six participants specifically brought up positive impressions of the cue questions aiding in the video/note review process, four participants mentioned that they viewed the cue questions as way to identify potential shortcomings in their notes, and three Figure 10: Participants responses to utility and usability of NoTeeline interface and various features (7-point Likert scale, higher is better). Impact of Note Expansion. All 12 participants reviewed some aspect of the expanded note favorably. All critical feedback, present in four of the responses, focused on the potential for verbosity and redundancy in the expanded notes (refer to 8.2 for demonstration of how NoTeeline still improves upon the baseline for measures of redundancy). Still, nine reviews expressed appreciation for the quality/level of detail in the expanded note, and five reviews brought up that the expanded note captured details/context they would have otherwise missed, due to such reasons as cognitive and time Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Faria Huq, Abdus Samee, David Chuan-en Lin, Xiaodi Alice Tang, and Jeffrey P. Bigham participants highlighted the perceived relevance of cue questions to the video content. Impact of Summary. 11 out of 12 participants reviewed some aspect of the summary feature positively. Four responses brought up satisfaction with the summarys ability to capture the gist/important contexts from their notes. Three responses mentioned preference for notes versus the generated summary for reviewing purposes: P1 prefers reviewing small details while P3 and P6 find the length too long. However, opinion on length is not uniform, as five responses (P5, P7, P8, P10, P12) reflected positively on the length of the summary. Four responses described desire for more formatting features, such as bolded or highlighted text. General Reception of AI Assistance. We conclude the thematic analysis with general review of reception to NoTeelines AI assistance during notetaking. Across the user study, ten participants specifically addressed the relationship between their labor and the AI features in NoTeeline impacting their workflows. P1 speaks to the division of labor in which they capture the smaller details while the machine... take[s] over the higher level summary. P1, P3-P4, P6-P8, P10-P12 speak to how the automated features distributed throughout NoTeeline provide enhancement or safeguard beyond their individual laborwhether capturing missed details/context, correcting typographic and grammatical errors or otherwise refining their writing, or surfacing unrecognized themes or shortcomings in their understanding of the material."

            "content": "While one might argue that spending more time to write individual notes is better way to get deeper engagement with the materials, and NoTeeline might seem to deviate users from writing effective notes, we argue that NoTeeline does not detract, but rather enhances the engagement in more meaningful ways. First, users are still responsible for initiating which parts of the material to take notes for and what information they want to capture, with NoTeeline simply helping to transform their input into fuller structured notes more suitable for later review. In contrast to existing fully automated tools, users are actively involved in notetaking. Second, NoTeeline reduces the disruption in watching videos caused when taking full notes (e.g., constantly having to pause the video) and freeing them from the mechanical task of writing. Thus, It helps maintain the uninterrupted flow of information. Third, NoTeeline also allows deeper involvement in note analysis and revision stages. After the users have finished taking the notes, they can always come back to it and edit, reorganize, and revise based on their needs. Our system provides features to review notes by the cue question, to manually edit the automatically expanded notes, to jump to the location where the note was taken, and to organize the notes in their desired structure and themes. These features were inspired by the Cornell notetaking system with their long history of improving long-term knowledge retention [18, 38, 88]. All these factors altogether enable users to deeply engage with content in NoTeeline."

            "content": "Based on our findings from the design and evaluation of NoTeeline, we highlight three insights to inform the future design of human-AI collaborative notetaking systems. First, our findings reveal that the greatest benefit of NoTeeline is the affordance of the micro note and its expansion. Being able to continue writing notes within their usual workflow while enjoying LLM assistance sparks interest. The ability to toggle back and forth between the original and modified notes enhances their overall experience by providing control over the content, critical factor in fostering user trust [31]. Future tools should support iterative processing, including automatic cleaning of grammatical errors, and offer both LLM-assisted and manual options for editing and organizing notes. Second, collaborative notetaking systems should provide granular user control. In our needfinding study, users mention concerns about LLM hallucination and lack of control in AI-assisted tools (4.2). Prior Research shows that trust in human-machine teaming can be positively impacted through transparency [1]. By giving users the ability to control precise moments to take notes and writing styles to maintain instead of relegating the generation task entirely to software NoTeeline can increase transparency in the notetaking process. Finally, an AI-assisted system should leverage implicit guidance [29] from users to regulate its generation quality. In NoTeeline, users would take micronotes as usual while implicitly guiding the system about what to focus on in the generated note. Such support for implicit guidance does not require additional effort from the user such as writing custom prompts for their individual requests every time."

While our study demonstrates that NoTeeline significantly reduces cognitive load and improves notetaking efficiency by minimizing writing effort and time, we did not measure the long-term effect of NoTeeline on information retention. The primary goal of this work was to evaluate the systems ability to facilitate efficient note-taking, not to assess how the generated notes impact user learning outcomes. This follows standard practice in prior research, as seen in works like Rambler[44] and VideoSticker[9]. Nonetheless, for future work, we could investigate how NoTeeline can influence information retention through longitudinal study."

While existing\ntools can automatically generate notes, they do not necessarily\ncapture the details and stylistic nuances users care about. Our\nneedfinding study reveals that users often do not prefer automati-\ncally generated notes due to concerns about accuracy and lack of\ncustomization. On the other hand, NoTeeline leverages rich contex-\ntual information to generate more accurate and more personalized\nnotes. Our user study reveals that NoTeeline helps write notes\nfaster with 93.2% correctness and achieves closer stylistic charac-\nteristics to users’ handwritten notes.

            "content": "SOCIETAL IMPACT By helping users take notes faster, NoTeeline has the potential to make notetaking more accessible for individuals who might otherwise struggle with factors such as language fluency (e.g., as demonstrated by P7s comments about difficulties of being nonnative English speaker) and physical disabilities. While there exist arguments about whether over-reliance on AI-generated content may lead to passive engagement or diminish personal organizational skills, we show how our tool exists to amplify, not override, user engagement in the generation process. We also expect this to decrease the risk of AI biases that might otherwise occur in fully autogenerated notes without any sort of user engagement.

We extracted 15-20 second snippets from each video and stored the timestamps. The videos are listed below: 1) How Mitochondria Produce Energy (Science); 2) How to get motivated even when you dont feel like it (Psychology); 3) Apple Vision Pro VS Meta Quest 3! HONEST Comparison! (Blog). B.2 Video Selection Criteria for User Study We picked two videos for the two conditions. The videos met the following criteria: 1) not too long (< 5 minutes); 2) information heavy where users are exposed to scientific concepts ( so that they feel the need to take note); 3) interesting to wide range of audience. Based on these criteria, we selected two TED-Ed videos entitled How memories form and how we lose them (url1) and Is it possible to lose weight fast? (url2). Both videos relate to Human Biology, are 4 minutes long, and have been viewed over 2 million times, reflecting their wide appeal. If time permitted, we also encouraged participants to try out NoTeeline with video of their choice to stir personal interest. For this, we explicitly asked participants to freely explore NoTeeline and observed no carry-over biases. Similar ordering of reproduction task and free creation task has been adopted by previous HCI works [8, 83, 84]."

PROMPTS USED FOR NOTEELINE D.1 Prompt for Note Expansion Figure 13 shows the prompt that we use for expanding the micronotes of the user. It specifies some rules explaining what kind of expanded notes are expected. The rules ask to resolve any grammatical mistakes, generate single sentence as the expanded note point, and avoid some specific phrases to start the expanded sentence. The onboarding transcript, onboarding micronotes, and the onboarding full notes are supplied as examples to the prompt. Moreover, the transcript of the YouTube video and the microntes of the user are also passed to the prompt for expansion. D.2 Prompt for Note Organization by Theme This prompt can be seen in Figure 14. It explains the structure of the theme that is expected as response. As an example, some points and their corresponding themes are incorporated into the prompt for better theme generation. Like the note expansion prompt, some rules have also been mentioned here. These rules tell how many points are to be grouped into one theme topic and that all points should be assigned detailed theme topic. D.3 Prompt for Cue Question The prompt here in Figure 15 asks to generate five multiple-choice questions based on the expanded note that has been provided. It also shows in what format the response is expected. topic and five multiple-choice questions have been added to the prompt. D.4 Prompt for Summary The prompt for summary in Figure 16 consists of context and some keypoints. The context here is the preprocessed transcript in Langchain and the keypoints are the expanded note points. It strictly asks to generate summary in 4 sentences and use the context only for additional information.

Expanded Note Summary Encoding is done with bidirectional LSTM , and the attention mechanism allows the decoder to treat encoded representations as form of memory to reference and highlight whats important at any time. In the lecture, the use of bidirectional LSTM in encoding is highlighted , with the attention mechanism enabling the decoder to utilize encoded Sequence to sequence models employ an encoder and decoder framework to handle tasks like building an end-to-end differentiable machine translation system. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be unrolled either from left to right or from right to left , encoding linear locality. Recurrent neural networks encode linear locality with computational complexity that is linear in terms of the sequence length. representations as memory form, focusing on relevant parts at any given time . This approach is foundational in sequence to sequence models , particularly in creating end-to-end differentiable machine translation systems , where an encoder and decoder framework is pivotal. The lecture also touches upon the nature of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which can be unrolled in both directions , thus capturing linear locality and maintaining computational complexity that is linear with respect to sequence length. This linear encoding of locality by RNNs contrasts with the quadratic computational complexity challenges faced by transformers, underscoring the evolution and adaptation within NLP technologies.

What are your main pain points with the current notetaking process? Do you use any existing AI software to assist with your notetaking? If so, please briefly describe their pros and cons. Are there any additional notetaking features that you would like to have in the tools you are using now? Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Faria Huq, Abdus Samee, David Chuan-en Lin, Xiaodi Alice Tang, and Jeffrey P. Bigham want you to act as personalized note-taking assistant. Users will give you keypoint and the YouTube transcript. Your task is to expand the keypoint into note point, by taking additional context from the transcript. The note should be full sentence in simple English. Follow these rules: 1. Resolve any typos or grammatical mistakes that arise in the keypoint. 2. The note should not be longer than 1 sentence. 3. Remember that the keypoint can be very abstract and as short as an abbreviation. Use the transcript to get additional information to ensure good quality note expansion. 4. Just write single note point, and users will request repeatedly for new points they want to add. 5. Write it in way user would write in notepad. Do not use sentences such as This video talks about..., The speaker explains.. etc. Make sure that the note aligns with the users writing style so that they can read it easily. Use the same writing style as shown below. Here are three examples: Transcript: Onboarding Transcript Keypoint: Onboarding Micronotes Note: Onboarding Full Note The keypoint refers to the high-level keypoint provided by the user and your task is to write full Note point. Make sure that your expanded note point matches the writing style of Note in the provided examples. Expand the provided keypoint into one sentence note. Transcript: Input Transcript Keypoint: Input Micronotes Note: Figure 13: Prompt used for note expansion Given list of points, Your task is to perform topic modeling over them. Arrange the points into topics and provide name for each topic. Please mark the topic within <Topic></Topic>tags. the points are marked with <p>tag as well. Follow these rules: 1. Each topic should have more than one point. 2. Every point should be assigned under one topic. No point should be unassigned. 3. The topic should not be very high-level, make them as detailed as possible. Here is an example: Input points: 1.
