            "content": "Warning: The content in paper may be distressing or offensive for some readers. To combat hate speech (e.g., antisemitism), social media platforms moderate content according to set of policies, but these moderation policies are complex, nuanced, and dependent on local laws and societal norms (Common, 2020). This complexity makes developing and deploying automated systems, like various machine-learning models, challenging beyond technical efforts, and practical implementation involves interdisciplinary stakeholders. For example, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) provides starting point for identifying antisemitism and that has been 1Code and resources available at: https://github.com/ idramalab/quantify-llm-explanations 2Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference Figure 1: Evaluation of open-source LLMs using an incontext policy-oriented guideline for the classification task of detecting antisemitism. adopted by many governments and institutions, including the U.S. Department of State (IHRA, 2024; IHRA-USA, 2024; IHRA-MEMBERS, 2024). Ultimately, moderation policies are socio-technical specification. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising directions for moderating (e.g., detecting) harmful content online (Roy et al., 2023; Piot and Parapar, 2024; AlKhamissi et al., 2022; Thapa et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2025). Becker et al. (2024) fine-tuned proprietary GPT3.5 model for antisemitism detection using nonpublicly available annotated dataset of about 22K samples. However, fine-tuning has its challenges: it requires an annotated dataset, which is timeconsuming, lacks universal harm taxonomy, and lacks the scalability to keep up with the changing social media landscape (Chen et al., 2024a; Palla et al., 2025). Researchers have investigated alternatives to fine-tuning, like in-context prompting with reasoning approaches, e.g., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its adaptive variants, which aim to enhance reasoning by including multiple perspectives or abstract reasoning guides (Just et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025). However, LLMs utility in sensitive tasks remains limited due to its safety-tuned release (Vijjini et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), raising concerns about fully utilizing LLMs for nuanced tasks like detecting antisemitism. To explore this avenue further, we evaluate eight open-source LLMs to detect antisemitism via in-context learning without finetuning, e.g., explicit policy-oriented guideline (the IHRA definition with contemporary examples) in the prompt. We explore multiple prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot, CoT, and newly designed Guided-CoT, followed by an ablation study to identify more or less important in-context thoughts for our task. Additionally, we examine how the models perform when policy is provided in the prompt, across different decoding strategies and prompting techniques. Furthermore, we investigate the quantitative differences in LLM-generated explanations between content classified as antisemitic and non-antisemitic. Through quantitative analysis, we identify paradoxical behaviors in some models that may help facilitate strategic interpretability audits to assess their robustness and reliability. At last, we conduct qualitative analysis to identify cases where all LLMs misclassify antisemitism. Below, we summarize our main findings and contributions across eight models we study: We present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for antisemitism detection, demonstrating differences in utility (refusal rates, ambiguity, and repetitive generation) and performance traceable to model selection ( A). Across nearly all models, our engineered Guided-CoT consistently outperforms ZeroShot and Zero-Shot-CoT, regardless of decoding strategy, model size, or reasoning capability ( 4). Using Self-consistency, Guided-CoT improves positive-class F1-scores by at least 0.03 up to 0.13 compared to Zero-Shot-CoT and reduces refusal rates to nearly 0%, thus enhancing model utility. Providing additional context (in our case, the IHRA definition with contemporary examples as policy instead of short definition) does not necessarily improve model performance under Zero-Shot or Zero-Shot-CoT prompts, with some models experiencing even decrease in performance ( 4.5). In such cases where there is need to provide policy in the prompt, Guided-CoT can help. We introduce metrics to quantify model explanations and find that Zero-Shot prompts result in homogeneous responses across models, yet individual models distinguish between antisemitic and non-antisemitic cases significantly ( 5). In contrast, CoT-based prompts, especially Guided-CoT, highlight differences in explanations across all models, while these differences between positive and negative classes are not significant for most models. Qualitative analysis reveals that LLMs struggle to understand contextual cues in writing patterns ( 6). LLMs label posts as antisemitic solely because they contain stereotypical or offensive terms; additionally, LLMs mislabel quoted text and news-style reports, as well as neutral or critical opinions. Interestingly, LLMs flag typos (e.g.,kikes intended as likes) and proper nouns (e.g., Kiké) that resemble slurs as antisemitic."

            "content": "2.1 Defining Antisemitism Previous work on antisemitism (and other forms of hate speech) has used variety of definitions, which comes with degree of subjectivity, with many being ad-hoc and directly developed by researchers or used only within academia. This paper uses the definition of antisemitism created by the IHRA: Antisemitism is certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Along with the definition, the IHRA also includes several contemporary examples of antisemitism (see Fig. 14). Although the IHRAs definition has been controversial, it has been widely adopted, including by the U.S. Department of State (IHRA-USA, 2024), numerous universities integrating it into discrimination policies (Moses, 2025; Smith, 2025), and legislative bills at the state level (Hanshaw, 2025) referencing it to address antisemitism. Potential issues with the definition. We acknowledge that concerns about free speech have been raised regarding the IHRAs definition, primarily due to its explanatory note and contemporary examples, especially Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of State of Israel is racist endeavor. At the same time, prior to the examples, the explanatory note says that manifestations [of antisemitism] might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as Jewish collectivity but also that criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Some may see these statements as contradictory or argue that claiming Israels existence is racist endeavor is not antisemitic. While we briefly discussed potential issues, understanding how LLMs can be used to understand this definition is critical due to their real-world applications. 2.2 Related Work Numerous datasets have been published to facilitate hate speech detection research (Mathew et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2023; Hartvigsen et al., 2022; Nghiem and Daumé III, 2024), and researchers have studied it extensively across many social media platforms (Jahan et al., 2024; Casula and Tonelli, 2024; Tahmasbi et al., 2021; Zannettou et al., 2020; Antypas and Camacho-Collados, 2023). However, training and deploying adaptable classifiers to the evolving social media landscape remains challenging. Although LLMs capabilities in detecting harmful content have been studied (Kumarage et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2023; Kikkisetti et al., 2024; Nirmal et al., 2024), effective moderation requires an understanding of socio-cultural context (Kumar et al., 2024b), nuanced definitions and policies (Huang, 2025; Goldberg et al., 2024) related to hate speech. Hate-speech moderation faces fairness and bias-related issues: early work shows demographic bias in classifiers (Sap et al., 2019), and LLM-based systems yield inconsistent judgments across models (Fasching and Lelkes, 2025). LLMs can be oversensitive and poorly calibrated for implicit hate (Zhang et al., 2024), and remain vulnerable to adversarial prompting that elicits toxic outputs despite guardrails (Dutta et al., 2024). Aldreabi and Blackburn (2023) showed that changes in the definition lead to variations in toxicity scores. In LLM-related benchmarking study, Balachandran et al. (2024) examined model discrepancies in toxicity detection, reporting that almost all models they evaluated show an accuracy gap of 10% for detecting toxicity targeting Jewish individuals. Despite the wide adoption of IHRAs definition by institutions globally, to our knowledge, this study explores the first-ever LLMs capabilities in detecting antisemitism using IHRAs definition as policy. Researchers have improved LLM performance on downstream tasks through CoTs (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Vishwamitra et al., 2024), Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2024), emotion prompts (Li et al., 2023), and echo prompts (Mekala et al., 2023). Kolla et al. (2024); Goyal et al. (2025) and Zheng et al. (2024) used Reddit and Facebook community guidelines, respectively, highlighting the strengths and limitations of LLMs in applying comprehensive policy definitions. Furthermore, Balachandran et al. (2024) observed that while some models achieve high accuracy in toxicity detection, they also exhibit high refusal rates, limiting their practical utility. Explainability remains central aspect in utilizing LLMs. Yang et al. (2023) shows that stepby-step LLM rationales can improve implicit hate detection; however, Di Bonaventura et al. (2024) finds that LLM-generated explanations often lack usefulness and trustworthiness, warranting caution. Shaikh et al. (2022) shows that Zero-Shot-CoT can increase the production of harmful or undesirable output in socially sensitive tasks, but can also decrease it with improved instructions. To explore this further, our study introduces Guided-CoT, CoT-like prompting designed to enhance the understanding of in-context policy, performance, and utility of sensitive classification tasks. Additionally, we propose quantitative metrics for analyzing LLM-generated rationales for better interpretability and reliability for content moderation."

            "content": "LLMs3. We evaluate eight open-source LLMs from five families, including reasoning and nonreasoning: Gemma-3 12B, Gemma3 27B, Mistral2410 8B, Mistral-2501 24B, Llama-3.1 8B, Llama3.1 70B, QwQ 32B, and DeepSeek-R1-DistillLlama 70B (see Table 2). We use quantized versions for larger models (i.e., Llama-3.1 70B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B). 3NB: Not all models responded to classification; some refused to classify, while others provided labels other than Yes or No. We exclude the posts with invalid responses to ensure direct comparison between models for individual analysis. For simplicity, we refer to models by name and size (e.g., Gemma 12B), DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama as DS-R1-Llama, Zero-Shot as ZS, and use _q to denote quantized versions. Figure 2: (a) Percentage of invalid responses per model by prompting technique. (b) Greedy decoding. (c) Selfconsistency. (d) Guided-CoT ablation. Red indicates performance drop when excluding thought from Guided-CoT; green indicates improvement. Metrics: F1-score from positive class. Prompting Techniques. Tam et al. (2024) finds that model performance significantly declines when restricted to generating content under formatting constraints. Therefore, we design our prompts that allow models to generate free-form text to start the response, followed by summary and classification label at the end of its response. Overall, we explore Zero-Shot and CoT (Schulhoff et al., 2024) prompting techniques and propose new prompt design, Guided-CoT. ZS-(AS): We create ZS-(AS) to evaluate the models foundational knowledge in detecting antisemitic content and compare it to more sophisticated prompting techniques, treating this as baseline (see Fig. 15). Zero-Shot (IHRA): We instruct models to classify social media post by designing two Zero-Shot variants: 1) ZS-α: Model classifies post as Yes (antisemitic) or No (not antisemitic) according to the IHRAs definition without any additional context, like contemporary examples (see Fig. 16). 2) ZS-β: Building on the ZS-α, this includes IHRAs definition with contemporary examples (767 tokens) in the system prompt, with the same user prompt as ZS-α (see Fig. 17). ZS-CoT: This prompting technique uses the phrase Lets think step by step, encouraging the model to reason through the classification process. Guided-CoT (Ours): We design this CoT-like prompt to mimic human annotators thought processes (e.g., develop codebook to guide the annotation process (Halterman and Keith, 2024; Ling et al., 2022)) in labeling posts for antisemitism. We guide the model through the steps (see Fig. 19): 1) Break down the post to understand the authors written pattern, 2) Identify hidden tones like sarcasm, criticism, coded language, ambiguous phrasing, quoted statements, news, and reporting, 3) Check if the author is calling out to promote Antisemitism or spreading awareness, 4) Evaluate whether the post aligns with the IHRAs definition and contemporary examples, 5) Based on the above steps, analyze whether the authors stance toward the Jewish community is favorable. Dataset & Metrics. We use an existing dataset (Jikeli et al., 2023a, 2024b) labeled by human annotators based on the IHRA definition. This dataset consists social media posts collected from Twitter (now known as X) covering diverse conversations about Jews, Israel, and antisemitism between January 2019 and April 2023. It contains 11,315 social media posts (i.e., tweets), of which 9,362 are non-antisemitic, and 1,953 (17%) are antisemitic. As the dataset highly unbalanced, we select F1, precision, and recall for the positive class to measure the model performance."

            "content": "4.1 Differences in Generated Responses We first examine differences in LLMs responses based on greedy decoding (temperature set to zero), focusing on cases where models refuse or fail to provide valid responses. Based on our prompt design, response contain three things: free-form text, summary, and classification label. We categorize model responses into three groups: 1) Valid responses include summary and an explicit antisemitic label (Yes or No), 2) Indeterminate responses include summary and decision label, but the label is neither Yes nor No. E.g., Potentially, Ambiguous, or Cannot be determined without context, and 3) Failure responses either exceed the maximum token length (set to 2048) or the model explicitly refuses to respond, indicated failure-exceed and failure-refusal, respectively. Four models, Gemma 12B (15.34% posts), Gemma 27B (3.55%), Llama 8B (3.92%), and QwQ 32B (5%), frequently generate invalid responses (either type of Indeterminate or Failure); percentages are calculated across all five prompting variants (see Fig. 2 (a)). Prompting style substantially affects these behaviors: Guided-CoT reduces Llama 8Bs refusal rate to only 0.07% compared to Zero-Shot and ZS-CoT, while QwQ 32B exceeds the 2048-token limit primarily when the IHRA definition with contemporary examples is added. In Apx. C, we discuss differences across other axes. 4.2 Deterministic Evaluation Some models generate invalid responses, so we exclude those posts and responses from the analysis. We evaluate models with greedy decoding for valid responses (see Fig. 2 (b)), subset of 8,555 posts (7,031 non-antisemitic and 1,524 antisemitic). We examine changes in models performance from ZS-(AS) to ZS-α, from ZS-α to ZS-β, and so on. ZS-(AS) baseline reflects models inherent understanding of antisemitism, as we do not provide an explicit definition. Under ZS-(AS), Llama 70B_q performs best, while Gemma models perform worst (high recall with low precision), indicating bias in labeling content as antisemitic (see Fig. 9). Adding the IHRA definition (ZS-α) yields mixed performance, most models either slightly decrease or remain unchanged, except QwQ 32Bs performance increases (+0.03). The IHRA definition, including contemporary examples (ZS-β), improves performance for most models, except Llama 8B and Mistral 24B. To investigate this behavior, we prompt all models to define antisemitism and find that only Llama 8B, Mistral 24B, and DSR1-Llama 70B_q do not reference the IHRA definition, potentially resulting in less exposure during training (details in Apx. B.1). ZS-CoT yields mixed performance, except Llama 70B_q (0.02). Guided-CoT improves performance across all models. Overall, most models gain performance from more straightforward to sophisticated prompts. NB: We exclude Gemma models for low performance and potential bias in labeling, and also exclude the ZS-(AS) baseline from further analysis. 4.3 Non-deterministic Evaluation studies Previous that prompt deindicate sign (Sclar et al., 2023; Atreja et al., 2024), non-determinism (Song et al., 2024), and hyperparameters (Renze and Guven, 2024) can affect LLM performance. While we engineered our prompts by experimenting, we can leverage the Selfconsistency method (Wang et al., 2022), which has shown robustness to imperfect prompts and can help us compare models true performance over complete dataset. We run 30 inferences on all 11,315 data points (temperature 0.6, top_p 0.9), determining final classification decisions by majority voting. Llama 70B_q achieves the highest overall F1-score (0.66), with an increase of 0.09 compared to ZS-β and ZSCoT (see Figs. 2 (c) & 10). Interestingly, the midsized Mistral 24B performs similar to the reasoning model QwQ 32B (F 1 = 0.58). Guided-CoT improves performance across all models compared to ZS-CoT, with substantial 0.13 increase for Llama 8B. Our results confirm that Guided-CoT paired with self-consistency consistently yields higher performance, regardless of model size or reasoning capability. Comparison to Existing Work. Our work uses Jikeli et al. Version 3 (Jikeli et al., 2024a) of (2023a)s dataset. Becker et al. (2024) used Version 1 (Jikeli et al., 2023b) of the same dataset, comprising 6,941 posts, to evaluate their fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model trained to detect antisemitism. We compare our best-performing model on Version 1 to the evaluation results from Becker et al. (2024)s study (see Table 4). Using Guided-CoT, Llama 70B_q achieves an F1 Score of 0.72 with greedy decoding and 0.73 with self-consistency, outperforming fine-tuned GPT-3.5 (F1=0.70). NB: We do not have access to Becker et al. (2024)s training dataset or the fine-tuned GPT-3.5; we rely on the metrics reported in their study for comparison. 4.4 Guided-CoT Ablation We now conduct an ablation study for Guided-CoT to identify which thoughts contribute the most to models performance, excluding one thought at time (out of 5 thoughts). For example, prompt A1 excludes thought A1 while retaining thoughts A2, A3, A4, and A5 (more details in Apx. E). For ablation analysis, we have subset of 10,442 posts (8,594 non-antisemitic and 1,848 antisemitic), excluding the posts with invalid responses in one or more ablation conditions. To measure performance, we calculate the difference (delta) over F1-score, e.g. A1 = {A2, A3, A4, A5} Vs. Guided-CoT = {A1, A2, A3, A4, A5}. For instance, Mistral 8B scores 0.44 with prompt A1 and 0.49 with GuidedCoT, showing about 0.05 decrease in performance when A1 is excluded (see Fig. 2 (d)). For all models, important thoughts to improving performance are: 1) explicitly mention checking for sarcasm and criticism (A2), 2) explicitly instruct to check whether post promotes antisemitism or spreads awareness (A3), and 3) thought that encourages the model to reflect on analyzing whether the authors overall stance is favorable toward the Jewish community (A5). Conversely, breaking posts into chunks (A1) does not improve performance, except for Mistral 8B, which benefits substantially from it (0.05 increase in F1). Surprisingly, instructing explicit alignment with the IHRA definition (A4) may have improved performance for most models if excluded from Guided-CoT. 4.5 Impact of Additional Context across Decoding and Prompting We previously discussed performance changes resulting in the progression from simpler to more sophisticated prompts. Now, we focus on how models handle additional context; the key research question is: How does performance change when using just the IHRA definition versus adding policy (i.e., the IHRA definition with contemporary examples) across different configurations? Setup: We compare three configurations: 1) Greedy, 2) Sampling-based, and 3) Selfconsistency. We use the same hyperparameters for Greedy decoding and Self-consistency as described earlier. For the sampling setup, we run the dataset 5 times (temperature of 0.6 and top_p of 0.9) and average the results. For this analysis, we include 8,624 of the 11,315 data points (7,086 nonantisemitic and 1,538 antisemitic), excluding the posts with invalid responses. We use ZS-α as the base and pair it with other prompting to observe performance differences (), calculated by subtracting the F1 score from ZS-α Figure 3: Comparing transition from ZS-α to other prompting across different decoding strategies. Figure 4: indicates decrease in performance, and + denotes an increase when transitioning from ZS-α to the selected prompting. to selected prompting (see Fig. 3). For example, the ZS-α to ZS-β pair looks at the performance change when we add additional context (the IHRA definition with contemporary examples). The performance differences across prompting techniques remain consistent regardless of the decoding strategy (see Fig. 4). For instance, transitioning from ZS-α to ZS-β decreases Llama 8B and Mistral 24B performance across all three configurations. Similarly, ZS-α to ZS-CoT does not improve performance for three models: Llama 8B, Mistral 24B, and Llama 70B_q. ZS-α to Guided-CoT consistently improves performance for all models and configurations. Overall, all models gains the performance with Guided-CoT, except for Mistral 8B with greedy decoding, where the improvement is not as good as ZS-CoT."

            "title": "5 Quantifying Models’ Explanations",
            "content": "We examine the differences in the model-generated responses; the key research questions are: To what extent do LLMs generate distinct explanations from other models? How do these explanations differ when they label post as antisemitic versus non-antisemitic? Understanding these differences is important for model selection, as their ability to explain can help us identify biases or assess reliability. the average median distance, which we call Semantic Cross-Model Divergence (SCMD), capturing the models overall divergence across other models (see Eq. 3). Now, we examine differences along two axes: 1) Rank. We use SCM to rank models. high value indicates distinctive explanatory pattern that diverges from the norm, while low value reflects alignment with other models responses. For instance, SCMD of Mistral 8B is 0.12 (See Table 5). CoT-like prompting has higher SCMD for any given model than Zero-Shot. However, no consistent ranking pattern emerges between models. Llama 70B_q consistently demonstrates the lowest SCMD, indicating its explanations closely align with other models. 2) Cluster. Using Principal component analysis (PCA), we project each models 7-dimensional vector, SDV (Eq. 2), into 2D space, assuming that models that share explanatory patterns may appear closer regardless of the differences in predictions (see Fig. 5). Under ZS-β, models responses appear relatively closer, except for both reasoning models and Gemma 12B. ZS-CoT further separates both reasoning models and Gemma 12B from the rest. Guided-CoT further amplifies divergence for all models except Llama 70B_q, and Mistral 24B appears closer. Overall, Zero-Shot prompts yield homogeneous responses and Guided-CoT surfaces latent stylistic differences. Semantic divergence offers insights beyond accuracy, informing model selection where explanatory power is important for nuanced tasks like hate-speech detection. 5. Intra-Model Difference Analysis We now investigate intra-model differences, specifically how single models responses differ when labeling posts as antisemitic versus non-antisemitic. This analysis isolates differences within models rather than between them. Differences: For each model, we compute pairwise cosine distances (normalized [0,1]) from 15dimensional embeddings, producing an distance matrix (N = 9,725), reordered by predicted label, grouping antisemitic and non-antisemitic responses. If models explanations are semantically similar, the heatmap shows cooler colors; if diverse, it shows warmer colors. We visualize three groups (G) for discussion: 1) G++: LLMgenerated responses of all posts classified as antisemitic, 2) G: Responses of all posts classified Figure 5: Projection of each models Semantic Distance Vector (SDV) into 2D space using PCA. and axes represent the first two principal components. Setup: This analysis includes 9,725 posts with valid responses from eight models under three prompting strategies (ZS-β, ZS-CoT, GuidedCoT) using greedy decoding. We generate embeddings of LLM-generated responses using llm2vec (BehnamGhader et al., 2024) and reduce them to 15 dimensions via UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018). NB: We exclude intermediate thinking tokens for reasoning models to embed responses. 5.1 Cross-Model Difference Analysis The differences examined through this analysis highlight the organic variations in generated responses, capturing rationale, classification decision, and possible ubiquitous templating patterns, especially when using Guided-CoT. We recognize that simply embedding complete response as it is may not accurately reflect contextual differences, as responses may follow designed format and may include elements from the original social media posts. However, this approach provides useful first view on how models diverge. dA,n = Dc(eA , en ), SDVA = (cid:2)median(dA,n)(cid:3) 1 (cid:88) fA SCM DA = nN , (1) (2) (3) For each model pair (e.g., Llama 8B and Mistral 8B), we compute the normalized cosine distance (0: highly similar to 1: substantially different) between their embedded responses. At this step, we have distribution dA,n, shown in Eq. 1, where is the set of the other seven models (n ), {responses by model A}, {responses by model n}, and Dc is cosine distance (see Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13). Now, we represent each model by 7-dimensional vector, which we call Semantic Distance Vector (SDV), SDVA, indicating model As semantic mediandistance to every other model. Finally, we calculate H0: D+ = H0: D+ <= D, Ha: D+ > H0: D+ >= D, Ha: D+ < Model ZS-β ZS-CoT G-CoT ZS-β ZS-CoT G-CoT ZS-β ZS-CoT G-CoT Mistral 8B Mistral 24B Gemma 12B Gemma 27B Llama 8B Llama 70B_q QwQ 32B DS-R1-Llama 70B_q 0.11 0.03 0.43 0.05 0.06 0.02 0.04 0.07 0.11 0.01 0.44 0.07 0.11 0.04 0.04 0.09 0.00 0.03 0.12 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.07 0.12 0.06 0.36 0.06 0.11 - 0.06 0.26 0.00 - 0.36 0.01 0.11 - - 0.00 - 0.06 0.10 - - - - 0.26 0.55 0.86 0.51 0.19 0.07 - 0.95 0.95 0.56 - 0.51 0.19 0.07 - - 0.95 - 0.86 0.00 - - - - 0.

We interpret this positively, as Guided-CoT encourages adhering to the policy-oriented IHRA guideline, regardless of the classification accuracy. 2) For the Gemma family, exhibiting distinct, tile-like patterns for and G++, with G++ being more similar than G. We hypothesize that the Gemma models may differentiate responses based on different topics in input content, but further qualitative assessment is needed. 3) Reasoning models display clear separation across all groups in their heatmaps. Significance: We conduct significance test to determine if the differences observed through heatmap are statistically significant (more details in Apx. F). Because the G++ and groups differ in size, we randomly sample (k=1,500) responses per group without replacement. Next, we calculate the cosine distance between every pair of responses within each group. From these distances, we form two distributions: D+ and D. For instance, the D+ represents the average distances between responses labeled as positive. Under the Zero-Shot setting, all models except Llama 70B_q show significant differences, indicating that G++ differ from those for G. With ZS-CoT, the differences are significant for only four models, and with Guided-CoT for only three. Guided-CoT neutralizes response differences in models like Mistral 8B, Gemma 27B, and Llama 8B, compared to ZS-CoT, operating as stylistic regularizer. This behavior is meaningful as it may reduce hallucinations and biases, allowing models to focus on the task at hand. Interestingly, Llama 70B_q shows no significant differences between explanations for G++ and across prompting. Additionally, we use one-sided KS-test to compare D+ and D, checking if semantic distances for G++ are significantly larger or smaller than (a) ZS-β (b) ZS-CoT (c) Guided-CoT Figure 6: Heatmap of models responses grouped by antisemitic prediction (bottom-left) vs. non-antisemitic (top-right). as non-antisemitic, and 3) G+: Responses of all posts classified as antisemitic compared to classified as non-antisemitic. Under ZS-β, we observe clear distinctions in G+, especially in reasoning models. In contrast, G++ and appear visually similar, except for the Mistral family. For the Mistral family, explanations differ visually between antisemitic and nonantisemitic classifications but remain consistent within each group. Under ZS-CoT, the separation in G+ weakens for the Llama models and Mistral 24B, and explanations in G++ and become highly similar, with G++ showing higher similarity G. NB: We perform this test only where D+ and are significantly different. Under ZS-β, all models reject one-sided KS-test, indicating that D+ is not larger or smaller than D. This paradoxical behavior suggests bimodal or skewed distributions (crossing CDFs) in semantic differences, furthering the need for qualitative analysis to reveal potential biases or failure cases. Under ZS-CoT, this crossing behavior is observed only for Gemma 12B and Llama 8B, and under Guided-CoT, only for Mistral 24B. These three models require focused scrutiny, as their antisemitic responses cannot simply be categorized as uniformly more or less cohesive; rather, they exhibit distinct subgroupings, extremely cohesive for some responses and highly divergent for others."

            "title": "6 Misclassification Analysis",
            "content": "In this section, we qualitatively analyze the misclassified posts by sampling 260 posts (out of 8,555, for which we report performance in 4.2) that have the same predictions from all eight models but do not match the ground truth. Two authors categorize these posts manually into: 1) Quotes/NewsReporting (Q/NR), 2) Tone/Language/Stereotypes, 3) Opinion, 4) Religious, 5) Sarcasm, and 6) Contextual Mismatch. After both annotators independently completed the annotations (inter-rater agreement of Cohens Kappa 0.75 - considered high), we resolved the disagreements to finalize the categories. As result, we find the category-wise distribution as: Tone/Language/Stereotype (28%); Q/NR (25%); Opinion (21%); Contextual Mismatch (8%); Sarcasm (6%); and Religious (6%). We detail the codebook in the Apx. G. We observe that 28% of misclassified posts fall under Tone/Language/Stereotype, followed by 25% under Q/NR. For example, the post Weapons made in Israel are used for genocide, for ethnic cleansing L: https://t.co/NkCuaP3nkW C: https://t.co/2uyaexvQzw criticizes actions of Israel; all models flag it as positive, yet it is not antisemitic because it does not invoke an antisemitic trope according to IHRAs definition. Under Q/NR, the post Palestinian journalist Laila Ouda has been fired by France 24 for supporting her peoples cause and exposing Israels crimes and violations of international law. https://t.co/wsXvjK2asZ illustrates false negative. Most false positives fall under Tone/Language/Stereotype, whereas most false negatives fall under Q/NR. We also observe that user opinions contribute about 21% of errors. For instance, @CathyHigginsWY @VP @POTUS Whoaaaaaaaaaa. This makes me question my whole belief system. Next youre gonna tell me that Soros doesnt control all Jews and that rural folk arent subsidized by the devil worshipping city fags who eat curry and smoke jazz cigarettes is false positive. We identify contextual mismatch type in 8% of posts. Typos where users write kikes instead of likes lead models to misclassify content as antisemitic (e.g., RT @Purbita9: #AdiZaMountThisAward Aditi Rathore is daring she directly kikes adiza VMS). Proper nouns containing Kike are also misinterpreted as slur kikes (e.g., So sad missed kikes booblehead night because of work but at least got to see him walk off , reference to the Dodgers bobblehead night for player Kiké Hernández). Overall, models frequently struggle to assign correct label when posts include offensive language, tone, or stereotypes, as well as quoted statements or opinions, posing critical challenge to using these models in an automated fashion for social media content moderation. Our findings complement the previous study (Roy et al., 2023). Although experimenting with additional context is outside the scope of this work, prior studies (Kumar et al., 2024a) find that adding additional context improves the model performance."

            "content": "We conduct comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs, focusing on their classification performance and generated explanations for detecting antisemitism. We introduce an engineered CoTlike prompting, Guided-CoT, comparing its influence on model performance, generated explanations, and how effectively it handles in-context guidelines. Additionally, our quantitative approach to assessing LLM-generated responses reveals paradoxical behavior in some models. Through extensive experiments across various decoding strategies, prompting techniques, and the explanations they generate, we highlight key behaviors that may limit their utility and reliability, as well as their strengths and shortcomings, in nuanced task like detecting antisemitism. Future research can use these findings to audit models qualitatively, enhancing our understanding of the limitations associated with misclassification and potential biases."

            "title": "8 Limitations",
            "content": "Dataset. The human-annotated dataset used in our study to design and evaluate the guided-CoT prompting technique has two primary limitations: First, it only encompasses the mainstream platform Twitter and tweets only in English, limiting the evaluation of our prompt design in multilingual setting. more comprehensive evaluation may include platforms like Reddit (Chen et al., 2024b), as well as alternatives, like Scored (Patel et al., 2024) and Lemmygrad (Balci et al., 2025b), where Israeland Jewish-related topics frequently appear. Additionally, multimodal contexts, specifically videocentric platforms like YouTube and Rumble (Balci et al., 2025a, 2024), have also revealed discussions on this domain, providing researchers with an opportunity to investigate how models interpret moderation policies. Second, the absolute performance of studied models may vary slightly, as annotators of the Twitter dataset were allowed to look at additional context during labeling, e.g., attached images, hyperlinks, replies, likes, and comments. Upon qualitatively examining false negatives, we find cases where the models explanations explicitly request more context, instances where the authors of this study also agree that additional context would be necessary, contradicting the ground truth, which is labeled antisemitic. Evaluation. We evaluate our prompting strategies across three decoding strategies: 1) Greedy, 2) Sampling, and 3) Self-consistency. However, we limit the hyperparameters for sampling and self-consistency to single set, recognizing that alternative hyperparameter configurations could result in slight variations in the presented numbers. Nonetheless, we run extensive self-consistency evaluations across all data points for six models, with each instance evaluated 30 times. Since Self-consistency can reduce the measurement errorrate as we increase the inferences and are robust to prompt formats, our empirical findings about the comparison of models are robust as per Selfconsistency. We use UMAP for dimensionality reduction to reduce LLM-generated responses, specifically reducing the embeddings to 15 dimensions. Selecting an appropriate dimensionality is challenging, as different models may benefit optimally from different dimensions. We conduct systematic grid search of UMAP hyperparameters to avoid arbitrary selection, selecting dimensionality based on maximizing the trustworthiness metric (van der Maaten, 2009; Pedregosa et al., 2011). Moreover, we also back up our observations of LLM-generated responses with significance test. Guided-CoT. Our proposed Guided-CoT prompting shows benefits across evaluated models; however, the scope of our contribution is limited to eight models, two baseline prompting techniques (Zero-Shot and Zero-Shot-CoT), and one policy guideline (the IHRA definition). Additionally, we only evaluate Guided-CoT on single dataset collected from Twitter. We acknowledge that the generalizability aspect of Guided-CoT is limited and under-explored for diverse datasets, multiple social media platforms, multilingual contexts, and different moderation policies. Thoughts we include in the Guided-CoT are engineered for our task and might not generalize to other downstream tasks. Our work primarily explores whether LLMs can effectively leverage in-context instructions for antisemitism detection. Nonetheless, researchers can directly utilize the methodology and insights from this study for their work. Guided-CoT using Llama 70B outperforms finetuned GPT-3.5, evaluated on about 6.9K data points. Again, we rely on the numbers reported in Becker et al. (2024)s study and do not have access to more details on when and how the model was trained. Although the comparison lacks specific details, we aimed to measure carefully engineered prompting technique versus fine-tuned proprietary model, not to claim the superiority of our prompting, which could be generalizable for any task. Analyses on Subset of Dataset. One of the challenges in evaluating and understanding the use of LLMs for detecting antisemitism is the safetyaligned release from developers. During our initial experiments, we find that some models generate invalid responses that we cannot assess for our analysis. Therefore, we slice the dataset into subsets for particular analyses to address this. However, we treat each analysis independently to maximize the number of usable data points, and this may not be an ideal comparison. Conversely, if we had used the same subset across the entire study, we would have been limited to approximately 62% of the data. We recognize this limitation and, as result, do not compare results across different analysis setups. For example, to answer the question, How do models perform under deterministic decoding? we hold subset-X constant across all eight models and report the findings accordingly."

            "title": "9 Ethical considerations",
            "content": "This study examines antisemitism detection using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliances (IHRA) working definition (IHRA, 2024). We emphasize that the authors did not develop this definition, but it is widely recognized and actively adopted by numerous governments and international bodies (IHRA-MEMBERS, 2024). For instance, the United States uses the IHRAs definition, highlighting its substantial real-world impact beyond academic contexts (IHRA-USA, 2024). Our utilization of the IHRA definition does not reflect our judgment regarding its validity. Instead, it highlights its practical significance and applicability in moderation policies implemented by platforms and governing bodies worldwide. Our analyses are conducted with datasets annotated according to the IHRA definition by prior researchers (Jikeli et al., 2023a, 2024b). Any potential biases inherent to these datasets or annotations are comparable to those in other hate speech and toxicity datasets widely used in the literature. We stress that our work does not involve subjective judgments by the authors regarding specific political or religious contexts beyond the explicit content of the IHRA definition and accompanying examples. We affirm that our primary goal is to advance research on hate speech detection to facilitate more effective moderation systems. We recognize the importance of cautious interpretation and application of our research findings in real-world scenarios, particularly given automated content moderation systems complexities and potential societal impact."

A.1 Utility Different models exhibit distinct patterns of invalid responses. Gemma-family models generate the highest number of ambiguous classifications rather than providing explicit Yes/No labels. Llama 8B exhibits the highest refusal rate among all evaluated models. This behavior is potentially due to differences in their postalignment training process. QwQ 32B often gets stuck in repetitive generation under greedy decoding. Guided CoT reduces Llama 8Bs refusal rate to nearly Zero percent and lowers ambiguous responses from Gemma-family models. For all the models, important thoughts to improving antisemitism detection performance include: 1) explicitly mention checking for sarcasm and criticism, 2) explicitly instruct to check whether post promotes antisemitism Model Size Release Time Multilingual Reasoning Quantized Developer Mistral 2410 Mistral 2501 Gemma 3 Gemma 3 Llama 3.1 Llama 3.1 DS-R1-Llama QwQ 8B 24B 12B 27B 8B 70B 70B 32B Oct, 2024 Jan, 2025 Mar, 2025 Mar, 2025 Jul, 2024 Jul, 2024 Jan, 2025 Mar, Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No No No No Yes Yes No No No No No Yes Yes No Mistral AI Mistral AI Google Google Meta Meta DeepSeek Qwen Table 2: Models being evaluated in this study with their attributes. or spreads awareness, and 3) including guiding step that encourages the model to reflect on analyzing whether the authors overall stance is favorable toward the Jewish community. A.2 Performance Llama 70B_q achieves the highest overall performance using greedy decoding, while Gemma-family models consistently perform the worst across all prompting techniques evaluated. When used with Guided-CoT, the mid-sized model Mistral 24B demonstrates performance comparable to reasoning models QwQ 32B and DeepSeek-R1-Llama 70B_q. Guided-CoT, with greedy decoding, substantially improves antisemitism detection performance across all models compared to ZeroShot and Zero-Shot-CoT, except Mistral 8B, which shows only marginal improvement. A.3 Reliability Zero-Shot prompting results in homogeneous responses, and under Zero-Shot-CoT, notable divergence is seen in reasoning-oriented models. Guided-CoT further amplifies latent differences, particularly within smaller models and reasoning models; however, Llama 70B_q and Mistral 24B are seen very close to each other. Under the Zero-Shot setting, all models except Llama 70B_q exhibit significant semantic distance from all the posts classified as antisemitic toward those classified non-antisemitic. The absence of this difference in Llama 70B_q, consistent across ZeroShot-CoT and Guided-CoT prompts, indicates strong adaptability in following task-specific policies for antisemitism classification. Intra-model analyses reveal significant differences in response distributions for antisemitic versus non-antisemitic classifications under Zero-Shot. Three models exhibit bimodal or crossing distributions (e.g., Gemma 12B, Llama 8B, Mistral 24B), indicating subsets of posts with complex behaviors for interpretability, requiring deeper qualitative review. Strategic interpretability audits guided by these statistical insights are essential for uncovering subtle biases and ensuring robust moderation practices. A.4 Prompting Techniques Transitioning from Zero-Shot-α to Zero-Shotβ (i.e., IHRA definition with contemporary examples) or to Zero-Shot-CoT (adding reasoning instructions along with full IHRA definition) decreases performance for certain models (e.g., Llama 8B, Mistral 24B, and Llama 70B_q), indicating that simply providing more context or prompting model to reason does not ensure improvements. Guided-CoT consistently yields the highest F1 gains regardless of the decoding strategy chosen, except Mistral 8B with greedy decode. Our ablation study suggests potential reason for this: removing one thought may have improved Mistral 8Bs performance by 0.04 on F1. Prompting techniques substantially influence how closely each models explanations align, on average, with those of other models. However, no consistent pattern emerges across different prompting methods. Llama 70B_q consistently generates the most cohesive responses close to other models, regardless of the prompting technique. Figure 7: CDF of total number of generated tokens for all posts across eight models and all prompting variants. NB: X-axis is log-transformed (i.e., 10x). Among non-reasoning models, Gemma-family models generate the longest responses. QwQ 32B generates the longest responses out of the reasoning models. Guided-CoT generates longer responses than other prompting techniques studied."

Table 3 provides mean response lengths (output tokens) generated by different models across these techniques.

Reasoning models produce more tokens due to built-in thinking capability before generating responses. Refusal Response (Llama 8B with ZS-β) cannot create content that could be used to promote or glorify antisemitism. Is there anything else can help you with? Figure 8 non-reasoning models for the same prompting variants. Additionally, Mistral 8B fails to generate reasoning chain in the ZS-CoT setting despite including the explicit instruction Lets think step by step, and we found that forcing the model to reason required presenting this phrase independently without any additional text surrounding this phrase. Guided-CoT consistently generates the longest responses across all models studied. On average, Guided-CoT generates approximately twice the number of tokens compared to ZS-CoT. Reasoning models generate longer responses across all prompting strategies due to inclusion of thinking tokens. Specifically, QwQ 32B generates very long responses, highlighting substantial generation of thinking tokens before providing an answer. QwQ 32B generates about 1.5 times more tokens with Guided-CoT than ZS-CoT, whereas DeepSeek-R1Llama 70B_q shows only marginal increase. C.2 Generation We categorize model responses into three groups, as discussed in 4.1. Further examination reveals distinct response patterns across models, indicating varying behaviors likely arising from their specific training or post-alignment methods. Gemmafamily models primarily generate responses categorized as indeterminate, offering uncertain or Interestingly, context-dependent classifications. Gemma-family models show reduced invalid responses with CoT-like prompting, Zero-Shot-CoT, and Guided-CoT. We hypothesize that CoT-style prompts may compel these models to recognize ambiguity, leading them to provide cautious or noncommittal responses when the context is insufficient. In contrast, Llama 8B often explicitly refuses to generate responses, interpreting the given task as generating antisemitic posts rather than classifying them (see Fig. 8). QwQ 32B frequently exceeds the 2048-token response limit due to getting stuck in repetitive token generation under greedy decoding and this means we dont get an answer.

One-sided (greater) test: H0 : +(x) (x) Ha : +(x) > (x) for all for some x. Intuition: Is the antisemitic curve shifted left (toward lower scores)? Rejecting H0 implies antisemitic explanations are, on average, more cohesive (semantically closer, meaning distance is less) than non-antisemitic ones. One-sided (less) test: H0 : +(x) (x) Ha : +(x) < (x) for all for some x. Intuition: Is the antisemitic curve shifted right (toward higher scores)? Rejecting H0 indicates antisemitic explanations are, on average, less cohesive (at distant) than their non-antisemitic counterparts. Note: If the two-sided test is significant but only one one-sided test is significant, the difference is monotonic: antisemitic responses are either consistently closer or consistently distant. If both onesided tests are significant, the ECDFs must cross. Antisemitic responses are closer in one part of the distribution but distant in another, indicating complex and non-monotonic (bimodal or skewed) pattern that merits qualitative inspection."

Next youre gonna tell me that Soros doesnt control all Jews and that rural folk arent subsidized by the devil worshipping city fags who eat curry and smoke jazz cigarettes Ground Truth: Non Antisemitic Zero-Shot-β: This Twitter post contains several elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Specifically, it mentions George Soros, Jewish billionaire often targeted by antisemitic conspiracy theories, and implies that he controls all Jews. This is classic example of mendacious and stereotypical allegation about Jews as collective, which is listed as an example of antisemitism in the IHRA definition. Additionally, the post employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits, such as implying that Jews are part of group that is devil worshipping and engaging in other derogatory behaviors. This kind of language is also consistent with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Summary: The post contains antisemitic language and conspiracy theories. Antisemitic: Yes Zero-Shot-CoT: To classify the Twitter post, lets analyze it step by step according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism. 1. The post mentions Soros, likely referring to George Soros, Jewish billionaire often targeted by antisemitic conspiracy theories. 2. The phrase Soros doesnt control all Jews implies that Soros has control over some or many Jews, which is classic antisemitic trope about Jewish people being controlled by single individual or group. 3. This statement is an example of making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective (IHRA definition). Based on the analysis, the post contains antisemitic content. Summary: The Twitter post contains antisemitic content by perpetuating conspiracy theory about Jewish people being controlled by George Soros. Antisemitic: Yes Guided-CoT: Lets break down the Twitter post step by step: 1. The post is broken into several chunks: - The initial expression of surprise and questioning of the authors belief system. - The mention of Soros, implying connection to Jews. - The statement about rural folk being subsidized by \"devil-worshipping city fags who eat curry and smoke jazz cigarettes,\" which appears to be derogatory and unrelated remark. 2. The post appears to be mix of sarcasm and coded language. The author seems to be using irony and hyperbole to express their surprise and skepticism. However, the mention of Soros and the connection to Jews is common antisemitic trope. 3. The post does not appear to be calling out to promote antisemitism or using statements to spread awareness about antisemitism. Instead, it seems to be using coded language to perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes. 4. The post potentially aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, specifically the example of \"Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.\" The mention of Soros controlling Jews is common antisemitic conspiracy theory. 5. Based on the analysis, the posts stance is not favorable to the Jewish community, as it perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories. Summary: The post contains antisemitic language and perpetuates conspiracy theories about Jews.

Llama 70B_q Twitter Post: RT @Purbita9: #AdiZaMountThisAward Aditi Rathore is daring she directly kikes adiza VMS Ground Truth: Non Antisemitic Zero-Shot-β: The Twitter post contains the term kikes, which is derogatory and offensive term used to refer to Jews. This term is classic example of antisemitic language and is often used to express hatred or contempt towards Jews. Summary: The Twitter post contains antisemitic language. Antisemitic: Yes Zero-Shot-CoT: To classify the Twitter post, lets break it down step by step: 1. The post contains the word kikes, which is derogatory and offensive term used to refer to Jews. 2. The IHRA definition states that antisemitism can be expressed in speech, writing, visual forms, and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. 3. The use of the term kikes is classic example of antisemitic language, as it is pejorative term that has been used to demean and dehumanize Jews throughout history. Based on the IHRA definition, the Twitter post can be classified as antisemitic. Summary: The Twitter post contains antisemitic language and employs derogatory term to refer to Jews. Antisemitic: Yes Guided-CoT: Lets analyze the Twitter post step by step: 1. Breaking the post into chunks: - The post starts with RT @Purbita9, indicating that its retweet of someone elses content. - The hashtag #AdiZaMountThisAward seems to be related to specific topic or event, possibly an award or competition. - The text Aditi Rathore is daring she directly kikes adiza VMS is the main content of the post. 2. Identifying the type of post: - The post appears to be statement or an opinion, rather than sarcasm, criticism, news, or reporting. - The language used is informal and seems to be from personal perspective. 3. Checking the intent: - The post does not seem to be calling out to promote antisemitism or using statements to spread awareness about antisemitism. - However, the use of the word kikes is derogatory term for Jews, which raises concerns. 4. Assessing alignment with IHRA definition: - The post does not directly target the Jewish community, Israel, or Jewish institutions. - However, the use of the word kikes is classic antisemitic trope, which is listed as an example of antisemitism in the IHRA definition. 5. Deciding on the stance: - The posts use of derogatory term for Jews suggests that the authors stance is not favorable to the Jewish community. Summary: The post contains derogatory term for Jews, which raises concerns about antisemitism. Antisemitic: Yes Table 7: [False Positive (Contextual Mismatch), Guided-CoT] Sample response across prompting techniques for Llama 70B_q. IHRA Definition with contemporary examples Antisemitism is certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations: Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for why things go wrong. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to: * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as people, or Israel as state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of State of Israel is racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. Antisemitic acts are criminal when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries). Criminal acts are antisemitic when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews. Antisemitic discrimination is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.
