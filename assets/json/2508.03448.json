Samples, code, model, dataset, and demo are all available through https://amaai-lab.github.io/SonicMaster/ Introduction Music tracks produced in amateur settings often suffer from variety of audio quality issues that distinguish them from professionally mastered recordings (Wilson and Fazenda 2016; Mourgela et al. 2024; Deruty and Tardieu 2014). For instance, an enthusiast recording vocals in garage may introduce excessive reverberation, making the voice sound distant and echoey. Similarly, using inexpensive microphones or misconfigured interfaces can lead to distortion and clipping when loud peaks exceed the recording range, resulting in harsh crackles or flattened dynamics (Zang et al. 2025). Tonal imbalances are also common: home recording might sound overly muddy or tinny if certain frequency bands dominate or vanish due to poor room acoustics or improper microphone placement. Even the stereo image can be narrowed or skewed, reducing the sense of space in the mix. Figure 1: SonicMaster pipeline: flow-matching model trained on the SonicMaster dataset (19 simulated enhancements across EQ, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, stereo) takes an input music waveform and text prompts to produce high-fidelity enhanced output. In practice, engineers address these problems with separate specialized tools: e.g., dereverberation plugins to remove room echo, declipping algorithms to reconstruct saturated peaks, equalizers to rebalance frequencies, and stereo enhancers to widen the image. Mastering flawed track thus becomes labor-intensive process requiring expert skill and multiple stages of manual adjustment. The need for an automated all-in-one solution is evident. Creators with limited resources often lack the expertise to apply the right combination of restoration tools, and piecemeal approach may fail to fully recover tracks fidelity. This motivates SonicMaster, unified approach to music restoration and mastering that can correct broad spectrum of audio degradations within single model. We introduce single flow-based generative framework that simultaneously performs dereverberation, equalization, declipping, dynamic-range expansion, and stereo enhancement. The backbone is trained on curated corpus of polyphonic music rendered through combinatorial grid of simulated degradations, enabling the network to learn the joint statistics and cross-couplings of common artifacts rather than treating them in isolation. This joint training eliminates the need for error-prone cascades of task-specific modules and reduces inference to single forward pass. SonicMaster is conditioned on free-form text prompts that encode high-level production intent. prompt such as reduce the hollow room sound attenuates late reFigure 2: SonicMaster dataset creation pipeline and overview. flections without suppressing desirable early reverberation, whereas increase the brightness selectively enhances the treble frequencies while while preserving spectral balance elsewhere.When the prompt is omitted, an automatic mode leverages learned perceptual heuristics to produce balanced master suited to non-expert users. Existing models (e.g. VoiceFixer (Liu et al. 2021)) fail on musicfocused pipelines typically address artifacts sequentially, ignoring their mutual influence. By unifying restoration and mastering tasks under single, prompt-driven generative model, SonicMaster delivers professional-grade improvements while affording fine-grained creative control. In the absence of text-conditioned music-restoration data, we build new large-scale corpus for controllable restoration. From 580 Jamendo recordings we retain 25 high-quality 30-s segments, balanced across 10 genre groups by production quality score. Each clean clip is corrupted with one to three of 19 common effects drawn from five categoriesEQ, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereoproducing paired degraded versions. Every degraded sample is accompanied by natural-language prompt describing the artifact or required fix, and all random effect parameters are stored as metadata. This genre-diverse collection of tens of thousands of promptaudio pairs underpins SonicMaster training and offers rigorous benchmark for controllable music-restoration research. Our main contributions are as follows: We present SonicMaster, flow-matching model that corrects 19 common degradationsincluding reverb, EQ imbalance, clipping, dynamic-range errors, and stereo artifacts in single generative pass, while allowing freeform textual prompts for fine-grained creative control. To train and evaluate such system, we curate and release the first text-conditioned music-restoration corpus: 25k high-fidelity Jamendo segments spanning 10 genres, each paired with 7 degraded versions of itself, detailed parameter metadata, and natural-language instruction describing the required fix, resulting in 175 audio pairs. Related Work Restoring and mastering audio spans speech + music enhancement, audio inpainting, and source separationareas that have mostly been handled separately (Zaviˇska et al. 2020). Diffusion-based generative models and text-guided audio editing (Hou et al. 2025; Jiang et al. 2025) now let us tackle these problems together. We review these advances, their uses, and the gaps that SonicMaster aims to fill. Audio Inpainting and Declipping: Early signal-model and interpolation methods could patch only very short gaps (< 10 ms), leaving longer dropouts unresolved. Deep generative models now bridge that gap: diffusion-based systems convincingly regenerate missing music sections and clipped peaks (Moliner and Valimaki 2023). The authors in (Wang et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2023) extend this with instructionguided diffusion for audio inpainting, while VoiceFixer (Liu et al. 2021) jointly denoises, dereverbs, and declipse speech, though it is restricted to voice and does not offer user control. In music, (Imort et al. 2022) removed heavy guitar distortion (including clipping) with neural networks, surpassing sparse-optimization baselines in quality and speed. Equalization and Tonal Restoration: Research on learning-based equalization is still emerging. In recently proposed work (Mockenhaupt, Rieber, and Nercessian 2024), the authors introduce CNN based approach to automatically equalize instrument stems by predicting parametric EQ settings, showing improvements over earlier heuristic methods. Notably, the VoiceFixer (Liu et al. 2021) addressed bandwidth extension essentially restoring high-frequency content as part of its speech restoration, which can be seen as form of equalization correction. Similarly, diffusion-based restorers like MaskSR (Li, Wang, and Liu 2024) treat lowfrequency muffling as distortion to fix, using discrete token prediction to restore balanced spectrum. In Text2FX (Chu et al. 2025), CLAP (Elizalde et al. 2023) is used in inference mode to steer the parameters of EQ and reverb audio effects."

            "content": "Dataset Due to the absence of natural language instruction-prompted music restoration datasets, we have generated SonicMaster music restoration and mastering dataset with text prompts. We source 580k recordings from the Jamendo1 under cre1https://www.jamendo.com/ simulate three types of rooms: Small, Big, and Mixed. For our fourth Reverb function, we utilize 12 selected room impulse responses from the openAIR library dataset (Howard and Angus n.d.), which give us audio with more real-life properties. The resulting impulse responses from all the functions are convoluted with the clean signals. Amplitude: This category consists of two functions: Clipping and Volume. We clip the audio by raising the maximum amplitude to predefined levels, which causes distortion to arise. In Volume, we reduce the volume to very low (barely audible) range, which decreases the signal-toquantization noise ratio. Stereo: This category contains one function to de-stereo the audio recording. First, the track is analyzed for suitability of this operation (whether it is stereo enough) by taking the standard deviation of the difference betwen the left and the right channels and comparing to set threshold of 0.08, then, if eligible, the left and right channels are combined to create mono audio recording. Each ground truth yields 7 corrupted variants: 4 with single, 2 with double, and 1 with triple degradation. In multidegradation, we sample at most one effect from each of the 5 categories, so an EQ choice, for instance, blocks further EQ picks. To avoid duplicates in the single-degradation set, high-probability effects with narrow parameter ranges: Stereo, Clipping, and Punchare, are used only once. Each degradation is linked to one-sentence instruction randomly selected from 810 expert-written options; these sentences are concatenated into the full prompt, and we store two prompt variants per clip for robustness. We also record every applied effect and its parameters (gain, absorption), supporting tasks such as parameter prediction. For Compression and Reverb there is 15% chance of injecting hidden clipping with no corresponding instruction. When neither hidden clipping nor an Amplitude effect is present, the audio is peak-normalised to random level between 0.8 1.0. Further details can be found in Appendix. SonicMaster Architecture SonicMaster combines Multimodal DiT (Esser et al. 2024) with subsequent DiT blocks (Peebles and Xie 2023). As outlined in Figure 3, the stereo waveform (44.1 kHz) (xt) is first encoded by VAE codec (Evans et al. 2024) into compact spectro-temporal latent. Restoration therefore occurs entirely in this learned space, allowing large receptive fields without sample-level overhead. The MM-DiT block receives the degraded latent and the text embedding from frozen FLAN-T5 encoder (Chung et al. 2024), and the conditioned representation is then passed to DiT layers that further process it to predict the velocity vt steering the latent toward its clean target ˆxt. Prompts like reduce reverb bias this prediction trajectory to suppress decay tails, while the downstream DiT layers also refine musical coherence. pooled-audio branch, active in 25% of training cases, concatenates temporally averaged 515 sec clean cue with the pooled prompt embedding and injects it at every MMDiT/DiT layer, enabling seamless chaining of 30 sec segments for long-form generation while degrading gracefully when no reference is supplied. Figure 3: Overall architecture of SonicMaster. ative commons licence using the official Jamendo API. To ensure equal representation of genre, we defined 10 groups, where each group consists of multiple related genre tags, e.g., Hip-Hop genre group containing the following tags: rap, hiphop, trap, alternativehiphop, gangstarap. The full list can be viewed in Appendix. To pick songs for each genre group, we started by deploying the Audiobox Aesthetics toolbox (Tjandra et al. 2025) to assess the production quality of all the recordings. Then, we selected 2, 500 songs for each genre group by filtering songs based on the production quality with an adaptive threshold between 6.5 8, depending on the current genre group. We strived to strike balance between representing all the subtags in each genre group sufficiently enough while maintaining high enough production quality scores. Finally, we extracted random 30 sec excerpt from each track, positioned between 15% and 85% of its total duration. The full data-generation pipeline is illustrated in Figure 2. We train SonicMaster by applying 19 distinct degradations to the audio and pairing each with matching editing instruction. The degradations span five classes: (i) EQ, (ii) Dynamics, (iii) Reverb, (iv) Amplitude, and (v) Stereo. Equalization (EQ): Spectral degradations cover 10 effects: Brightness, Darkness, Airiness, Boominess, Muddiness, Warmth, Vocals, Clarity, Microphone, and X-band. Brightness, Darkness, Airiness, Boominess, and Warmth are emulated with lowor high-shelf EQ; Clarity with Butterworth low-pass filter; Vocals and Muddiness with Chebyshev-II band-pass filters. Microphone applies one of 20 Poliphone transfer functions (Salvi et al. 2025), while Xband uses an 812-band, logarithmically spaced peaking EQ with 6 dB gain per band. Dynamics: This category contains 2 functions, Compression and Punch: modeled by feedforward compressor and transient shaper, respectively. Both these effects are applied in the time domain with lossy, irreversible nature, as constructing an exact inverse of these is an ill-posed problem. Reverb: The Reverb category contains four functions. Three of them utilize the Pyroomacoustics library (Scheibler, Bezzam, and Dokmanic 2018), which simulates acoustic environments with the image source method. We Audio and text encoding: We adopt the Stable Audio Open VAE (Evans et al. 2024) to encodedecode stereo signals sampled at 44.1 kHz, yielding compact latent representation while retaining high-fidelity reconstruction. Text instructions are embedded with FLAN-T5 Large (Chung et al. 2024); the resulting tensor ctext RBStextDtext (with Dtext = 1024) is fed to the model as conditioning signal. Training with the rectified flow: We train SonicMaster using rectified flow (Liu, Gong, and Liu 2022; Esser et al. 2024), to predict the flow velocity from degraded to clean audio in latent space, unlike other models that map noise to output distributions (Fei et al. 2024; Hung et al. 2024). We assign timestep = 1 to the latent representation of the degraded audio x1, and = 0 to the latent representation of the clean audio target x0. During training, we feed the model with samples xt, which are interpolations of degraded input x1 and clean target x0 on straight line: xt = tx1 + (1 t)x0 (1) where timestep is drawn from skewed distribution with increasing probability for higher as follows: p(t) = 0.5U (t) + 0.5t, (2) where represents uniform distribution. This skewed distribution gives emphasis to more degraded inputs given the interpolation of training data in Eq. 1. [0, 1]"

The ctext condition is also passed through pooled projection and used to control the scale and shift factors of the adaptive layer-norm layers in both MM-DiT and DiT blocks. The training loss is then given as: L(θ) = Et,x1,x0 ˆvtvt2 2 = Et,x1,x0fθ(xt, t, ctext)vt2 2 (5) During inference, the degraded audio input x1 is converted into clean audio output x0 by integrating the predicted velocity ˆvt using the forward Euler method: xt+h = xt + ˆvt (6) where [0, 1] is the step computed as the inverse of total timesteps dedicated for integration. Inference During inference, SonicMaster takes in an audio input and text instruction given by user to perform desired restoration/mastering operation. Inference is possible without text input in the so-called auto-correction mode. To process full-length songs, SonicMaster operates on chunks of 30 sec and then connects the segments together. After the first segment is inferred, the last 10 sec of this output are used to condition the next segment inference through the audio pooling branch. The overlapping regions of the resulting segments are then linearly interpolated over the overlapping 10 seconds to connect the segments together."

We adopt classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans 2022) by (i) dropping the text prompt in 10% of samples and (ii) replacing it in another 10% with one of four generic phrases (Make it sound better!, Master this track for me, please!, Improve this!, Can you improve the sound of this song?). In 25% of cases, the model is additionally conditionedvia the pooling branchon the first 10 of clean audio. Unless stated otherwise, all experiments follow these conditioning settings while comparing multiple SonicMaster variants and baselines. To enable thorough comparison, we benchmark several baselines along with different configurations of SonicMaster: (i) Degraded inputthe original corrupted audio; (ii) Reconstructed inputthe same audio passed (iii) Text2FX-EQ, through the VAE encoderdecoder; an EQ baseline using Text2FX (Chu et al. 2025) with 600 iterations and 0.01 learning rate to correct EQ (iv) WPE dereverberadegradations via our prompts; tion, the Weighted Prediction Error algorithm (Nakatani et al. 2010) with prediction order of 30; (v) HPSS dereverberation, harmonicpercussive source separation (librosa.decompose.hpss) with 6 dB and 12 dB harmonic attenuation; and (vi) three SonicMaster variantsSonicMasterSmall (2 MM-DiT + 6 DiT), SonicMasterMedium (4 MM-DiT + 12 DiT or 6 MM-DiT + 6 DiT), and SonicMasterLarge (6 MM-DiT + 18 DiT). Objective Evaluation Evaluation is conducted along two orthogonal axes. (i) Global perceptual fidelity is quantified with Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) on CLAP embeddings (Elizalde et al. 2023), KullbackLeibler divergence (KL), structural similarity (SSIM) on 128-bin mel-spectrograms, and the Production Quality (PQ) score from the Audiobox Aesthetics toolbox (Tjandra et al. 2025). (ii) Degradation-specific restoration efficacy is measured by average absolute error reduction: for every degraded clip in 7000 clip test set, we compute the relevant (based on the degradation deployed) artefact-aware metric against its clean counterpart from 1000 sample reference set, then recompute the metric after SonicMaster processing; the relative decrease indicates how closely each model variant approaches the ground-truth. For X-band EQ and microphone-TF degradations we compute the spectral balance over eight bands and report their cosine distance. All other EQ effects are scored by the energy ratio between the affected band and the full spectrum. Compression is measured as the standard deviation of frame-level RMS (2048-sample frames, 1024 hop); punch as the mean onset-envelope value (librosa.onset.onset strength).

Using 7-point Likert Scale, listeners were to rate: 1) The extent of improvement from the input to SonicMaster output represented by the text prompt (Text relevance), 2) audio quality of input (Quality1), 3) audio quality of the inferred SonicMaster sample (Quality2), 4) consistency and fluency of the inferred sample (Consistency), and 5) preference between the two samples, where 1 represents full preference of the ground truth degraded input, and 7 represents the SonicMaster inferred sample (Preference). The study was attended by 8 listeners (5 music experts and 3 Music Information Retrieval researchers). Results The results of the attribute controllability evaluation are depicted in Tables 1 and 2. SonicMaster significantly outperforms the baselines of Text2FX in EQ, and WPE and HPSS in Reverb. SonicMaster shows clear improvement in all categories when compared to the degraded and reconstructed inputs. Furthermore, we can observe that the reconstructed input metrics are overall slightly worse (with exceptions) than those of the ground truth degraded inputs. Across the audio-quality metrics in Table 4, SonicMaster outperforms the degraded inputs in both PQ and KL. Its FAD is only marginally higher than that of the degraded audio, yet markedly lower than the reconstructed baseline. Furthermore, SonicMaster achieves significant increase in PQ, almost reaching the level of ground truth mastered reference. In SSIM, SonicMaster exhibits lower scores than the degraded inputs but achieves superior performance compared to the reconstruction baseline. From Tables 1, 2, 4, we can observe that SonicMasterSmall performs comparably with SonicMasterLarge in all metrics, but slightly worse in Reverb, Clip, and Stereo. SonicMasterM edium (4/12) performs slightly better than the SonicMasterSmall, but still lacks behind SonicMasterLarge in Clip. SonicMasterM edium (6/6) performs the worst out of all variants across all metrics. As part of our ablation study, we compared SonicMasterLarge with different settings. Models with different lengths of audio conditioning (5 sec, 15 sec) perform similarly to the 10 sec setting. We chose to use 10 sec setting as our default as compromise between computation speed and length of overlap in neighbouring segments. Further, conditioning during inference, or no conditioning during training and inference at all produced comparable results. While the no condition variant provides best performance in Boom with absolute average error of 0.0658, it also provides the worst performance in Clip error with 2.055 compared to the aforementioned variants. Furthermore, we evaluated inference without text prompts, which yields comparable performance in FAD, SSIM, and PQ, but shows worse performance in KL (0.917 vs 0.696 on single degradation snippets). Performance in Clip and Stereo is also worse with values of 2.812 and 0.1416 as opposed to 1.506 and 0.1058. In EQ, values across the error values across the board are Model (MMDiT/DiT)"

We evaluated Euler solvers with 1, 10 (baseline), and 100 steps, plus 10-step 4th order RungeKutta (Dormand and Prince 1980) solver. Euler-1 matches the baseline overall but is weaker on Boom, Microphone, Clip, all Reverb subtasks, and shows higher KL. Euler-100 boosts Reverb and Punch yet lowers every EQ score versus the 1-/10-step runs. RungeKutta-10 equals Euler-10 on most metrics and tops Clip, but its inference is significantly slower. When evaluating SonicMaster with full songs, we can again observe significant improvements in EQ metrics  (Table 1)  , and in most functions in Table 2. However, the reverb metric of MSD shows mixed results. In audio quality metrics, SonicMaster shows decrease in SSIM and FAD compared to degraded inputs, except for FAD in double and triple degradation samples, which points to SonicMasters ability to handle multiple degradations at once. Subjective evaluation results are depicted in Table 3. In text relevance, we can observe very good ratings in Amplitude (6.19) and Reverb categories (5.59), which highlight significant perceptive improvement in declipping, volume increase, and in dereverberation. These two categories further show the highest improvement in quality, highest consistency ratings, and highest preference. EQ shows the third best text relevance, but worst preference ratings. Overall, SonicMaster samples are rated higher in quality compared to inputs and preferred across the board. paired t-test on Quality1 and Quality2 ratings shows statistically significant differences in Reverb, Amplitude, Stereo, and mixed degradations. These results further confirm SonicMasters capabilities in text-controllable music restoration and mastering.

Prompt: Please, reduce the strong echo in this song. tion and mastering is feasible when backed by large corpus and suitable training objective. key limitation, however, are occasional artefacts introduced by the lossy latent representation: reconstructed clips can exhibit robotic vocals or muted instruments, especially for certain genres, and the effect is stronger for degraded inputs than for their clean references. Future research should pursue less lossy latent encoders or alternative representations to minimize these distortions. The observed decrease in SonicMasters performance on full songs in SSIM and Reverb metrics could be related to the way neighbouring segments are connected together. Improving on this aspect could increase the objective performance further. Moreover, evaluating the amount of reverberation in music is challenging, as the audio is usually very dense. Additionally, the way generative model such as SonicMaster removes reverb in the latent space is not telegraphed, which makes it more difficult to choose correct metric. deep exploration of this topic would be of use to the community."

            "content": "We introduced SonicMaster, the first unified text-guided generative model for music restoration and mastering, capable of addressing wide range of audio degradations within single model. Key contributions include the creation of new SonicMaster dataset2 of paired degraded and highquality music with textual annotations and the use of flowmatching training paradigm to directly learn the restoration mapping. We also developed text-conditioned multimodal generative architecture that unifies diverse enhancement tasks, enabling the model to perform all restoration and mastering steps in one generative pass. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SonicMaster substantially improves audio quality, achieving strong results in objective metrics (e.g., FAD, KL divergence, SSIM, PQ) and consistently earning higher listener preferences in blind tests compared to both original and baseline outputs. 2Dataset, code, samples, model, and demo available through https://amaai-lab.github.io/SonicMaster/ References Chu, A.; OReilly, P.; Barnett, J.; and Pardo, B. 2025.

Each figure shows the clean reference, the degraded input (e.g., reverberation-induced smearing or clipping distortion), and the output of SonicMaster. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 compare clean, degraded, and restored spectrograms across selected scenarios (reverb, clipping, microphone transfer function, and clarity EQ). Prompts for each degradation type Prompt instructions for each degradation type are grouped by audio attribute in Table 8; for example, entries for Xband, microphone coloration, clarity, brightness, darkness, airiness, boominess, warmth, muddiness, vocals, compression, punch, reverb, volume, clipping, and stereo give natural-language commands that steer the restoration model. These instructions act as conditioning signalse.g., remove excess reverb and make it sound cleaner, raise the level of the vocals, or make this sound brighterso that the generative restoration trajectory emphasizes or suppresses specific signal characteristics.

Prompt: Clean up the harshness in the signal. (c) Restored output. (a) Original (clean). (b) Degraded input. Figure 9: Another example of the effect of clipping and its restoration. The degraded input shows signs of distortion with visible spectral content above 15 kHz. This distortion is suppressed by SonicMaster. Prompt: Clean up the noisiness in the audio. (c) Restored output."
