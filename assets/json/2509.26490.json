            "content": "Figure 2: VitaBench sources tasks from real-world environments by composing interconnected tools, diverse user requests, and structured databases. Agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogue, while rubric-based sliding-window evaluator tracks progress across the trajectory. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities [Bai et al., 2025, Zeng et al., 2025, Li et al., 2025], leading to increased deployment of LLM agents in real-world applications. These improvements have simultaneously driven the evolution of agent-centric benchmarks [Yao et al., 2024, Barres et al., 2025, Lu et al., 2025], progressing from simple task execution to complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. However, there remains significant gap between controlled laboratory settings and real-world deployments that present inherently complex challenges. Early benchmarks [Qin et al., 2024, Patil et al., 2025] focused primarily on function-calling and parameter accuracy, introducing difficulty through increased tool counts or distractors, yet overlooking the intricate interdependencies between tools and their environments. Some recent efforts [Yao et al., 2024, Barres et al., 2025] have begun exploring real-world challenges, but often impose rigid domain-specific policies and constrained action spaces, overemphasizing instruction-following over autonomous exploration. Furthermore, many inadequately consider users as environmental components who bring inherent uncertainty, despite this being critical challenge for practical agent applications [Qian et al., 2025]. This motivates our central research question: What constitutes task complexity for agents in real-world applications? Drawing inspiration from task complexity theories that examine structural, resource, and interaction dimensions [Liu and Li, 2012], we identify three fundamental aspects that shape agentic task complexity: (1) reasoning complexity, measured by the volume of environmental information that agents must process and integrate; (2) tool complexity, quantified through modeling tool sets as graphs based on inter-tool dependencies, where the node cardinality and edge density reflect the structural intricacy to navigate; (3) interaction complexity, characterized by the challenges arising from diverse user behavioral attributes and conversational patterns throughout multi-turn interaction. Building on this framework, we present VitaBench (short for Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark) to measure an agents ability to handle the inherent complexity of real-world applications (overview in Figure 2). We construct 66 tools across three domainsdelivery, in-store consumption, and online travel servicesand model their intrinsic dependencies as graph structure where policy information is inherently encoded. This allows agents to reason and explore autonomously without relying on domain-specific policies like τ -bench [Yao et al., 2024]. This design also enables flexible composition of scenarios and toolsets, facilitating the creation of 400 evaluation tasks spanning both single-scenario and cross-scenario settings. We derive each task from multiple authentic user requests and equip it with an independent environment containing annotated user profiles, spatiotemporal contexts, and comprehensive service databases. Given the extensive solution space of these instructions and environments where numerous valid pathways may exist, we introduce rubric-based sliding window evaluator to assess the resulting long-horizon trajectories. We evaluate multiple advanced LLMs on VitaBench, revealing that even the best-performing model achieves only 48.3% success rate across our 300 single scenario tasks, with performance plummeting to 30.0% in cross-scenario settings where agents must navigate between different domain contexts and choose right tools from expanded action spaces (Figure 1). Our comprehensive analysis validates the three-dimensional complexity framework, showing strong correlations between complexity metrics and task difficulty across domains. Through systematic failure pattern analysis, 2 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark we identify that reasoning errors dominate (61.8%), followed by tool usage errors (21.1%) and interaction management failures (7.9%), with agents exhibiting poor self-awareness and limited error recovery capabilities. Rigorous validation confirms the reliability of our evaluation components, establishing VitaBench as challenging and reliable benchmark for advancing real-world agent capabilities. All code and data will be released to ensure reproducibility."

While recent work has recognized the need for evaluating advanced reasoning, tool manipulation, and interaction abilities, current benchmarks typically address these dimensions in isolation rather than comprehensively. Table 1 compares prominent agent-user interaction benchmarks across our proposed task complexity framework. ToolTalk [Farn and Shin, 2023] first introduces multi-step tool execution through conversational interfaces but relies on predefined dialogue trajectories, limiting agent autonomy. While MINT [Wang et al., 2024a] emphasizes natural language feedback to guide agents and IN3 [Qian et al., 2024] focuses on detecting implicit intentions, both of them operate in relatively constrained agentic settings. More comprehensive frameworks like ToolSandbox [Lu et al., 2025] and the τ -bench family [Yao et al., 2024, Barres et al., 2025] pioneer stateful execution and model tool interdependencies, yet constrain agents through verbose policies rather than allowing truly autonomous exploration. DialogTool [Wang et al., 2025] explores role-playing for engaging users but focuses primarily on agent-side capabilities, while UserBench [Qian et al., 2025] uniquely captures preference-driven interactions, though with limited task complexity otherwise. Several works [Yang et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024b] also investigate agents abilities to recognize incomplete conditions and proactively seek missing information. However, none of these benchmarks simultaneously challenge agents across multiple complexity dimensions. Our work aims to bridge this gap with VitaBench, which presents information-rich environments requiring agents to autonomously explore, dynamically interact with diverse users, and navigate intricate tool dependencies to address real-world demands."

            "content": "3.1 Formulation The POMDP Formalism. We formalize the set of distinct environments as E. For specific environment E, we model the agent task as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) (U, S, A, O, , r)e with instruction space U, state space S, action space A, observation space O, state transition function : S, and reward function : R. The agent interacts with both databases (through API tools) and simulated user. Accordingly, the action space consists of two types of actions: tool invocation and interactive dialogue with the user. The state space comprises the state of the database and the user state, i.e., = Sdb Suser. The observation space includes the database feedback after tool calls and the conversation history with the user, i.e., = Odb Ouser. The state transition function decomposes accordingly: API calls follow deterministic transitions Tdb implemented as Python functions, while user interactions follow stochastic transitions Tuser implemented using language model. 3 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark Given an instruction U, the initial state s0 represents the token sequences of the given prompt and the initial state of the database. The agent receives an initial observation o0 O, which typically includes the first-round user request and the available tool sets. The LLM-based agent, parameterized by θ, generates an action a1 πθ(o0) based on its policy πθ. Subsequently, the state transitions to s1 S, and the agent receives feedback o1 O. At each step t, the agent acts based on the current observable history, which can be denoted as (o0, a1, o1, . . . , at1, ot1), generating action at πθ(o0, a1, o1, . . . , at1, ot1). The agent continues interacting with the environment until the task is completed or the maximum number of steps is reached. From the environments perspective, the complete state transition trajectory can be represented as: τ = (s0, a1, s1, a2, s2, . . . , aT , sT ) πθ(τ e, u), (1) where denotes the total number of interaction rounds. Note that the trajectory τ captures the complete state transitions, while the agent only has access to partial observations ot derived from states st. The reward r(e, u, τ ) [0, 1] is computed after the interaction ends. Agentic Task Complexity Framework. Building upon the POMDP formalism and drawing inspiration from multiperspective complexity frameworks [Liu and Li, 2012], we formalize task complexity along three dimensions that capture the challenges agents face in real-world applications: Ctask = Creason, Ctool, Cinteract. (2) Reasoning complexity Creason quantifies the cognitive demands of processing extensive environmental information under partial observability. We characterize this through the entropy of the observation space H(O) and the degree of partial observability η = 1 S , where higher values indicate greater uncertainty in state estimation. Building on this framework, we construct large-scale databases and composite tasks with multiple explicit and implicit reasoning points. Tool complexity Ctool captures the structural intricacy of navigating interconnected action spaces. We model the toolset as directed graph = (V, E) where vertices represent individual tools and edges encode inter-tool dependencies. Complexity emerges from graph cardinality , edge density ρ = of task-relevant subgraph. Cross-scenario settings further amplify this by expanding the action space across multiple domains. Interaction complexity Cinteract reflects the challenges of managing dynamic multi-turn conversations with users. User profiles encode personal attributes (e.g., gender, age, dietary restrictions) that influence task requirements. Behavior attributes introduce variability in cooperation levels and goal ambiguity, necessitating proactive clarification. Moreover, real-world users exhibit dynamic states Suser that evolve throughout the interaction, requiring continuous strategy adaptation. (V 1) , the coverage ratio Vtask These three dimensions collectively determine the difficulty agents encounter in sophisticated real-world applications, providing systematic guidance for benchmark design and evaluation. 3.2 Benchmark Construction We construct VitaBench through systematic pipeline illustrated in Figure 3. Specifically, this process can be divided into two stages: Stage I: Framework Design. We construct VitaBench through systematic abstraction of real-world life-serving scenarios across three domains: Delivery (food and product delivery), In-store Consumption (dining and other services), and Online Travel Agency (OTA) (hotel bookings, attraction reservations, flight and train ticket management). By referencing existing application implementations, we derive simplified API tools that capture essential functionalities. We model inter-tool dependencies as directed graph = (V, E) and augment tool descriptions with pre-conditions (states required before execution) and post-conditions (expected outcomes after execution). This graph-based design naturally encodes domain rules into tool structures, eliminating the need for verbose policy documents while simultaneously increasing reasoning complexity and facilitating cross-domain composition. For instance, modify_order requires prior execution of get_order_detail to obtain necessary information, reflecting natural workflow dependencies. To capture the inherent uncertainty in real-world interactions, we implement user simulator following Yao et al. [2024]. The simulator receives complete instructions containing multiple requirements but reveals them progressively to agents, and provides implicit constraints only upon inquiry. We configure each simulated user with unique profiles and behavioral attributes, employing prompt-based constraints to maintain persona consistency while minimizing critical errors that would impede task completion (validated in Section 6.1). Note that while user profiles are accessible to agents, we establish knowledge boundaries to reflect realistic scenariosfor example, agents cannot directly access dietary restrictions but must infer them from order history or user responses. 4 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark Figure 3: Overview of the VitaBench construction pipeline and simplified cross-scenario example. Stage II: Task Creation. Our data collection pipeline consists of four components: user profiles, task instructions, environmental information, and rubrics. User profiles derive from authentic platform data, which we anonymize and enrich to create distinct personas with varied personal attributes and communication styles. These attributes encompass emotional expressions (e.g., impatient, anxious, indifferent) and interaction patterns (e.g., detail-oriented, dependent, logical), leading to diverse conversational dynamics throughout multi-turn dialogues. Task instructions synthesize multiple real user requests into composite objectives, which we manually review and refine to ensure clarity and feasibility. Instructions either coordinate multiple sub-goals within single domain or span across different domains in cross-scenario settings, requiring agents to navigate between distinct contexts. For environmental data, we combine service provider and product information from real-world life-serving platforms with model-generated synthetic augmentation under human supervision. We deliberately intermix target options that satisfy all constraints with distractor options that violate specific requirements, creating extensive search spaces with numerous candidates while maintaining only handful of valid solutions per task. Additionally, we generate transaction histories to support requirements involving consumption patterns (e.g., order the same meal as last time or book my usual hotel). We iteratively refine each task through multiple trials with human verification, eliminating ambiguities while preserving multiple valid solution pathways. Through this process, we construct 400 tasks with comprehensive databases detailed in Table 2, where individual tasks typically involve 5-20 service providers and can include over 100 products in certain cases.2 3.3 Rubric-based Sliding Window Evaluator Evaluating long-form agent trajectories presents unique challenges due to their extensive length and multiple valid solution paths. While Yao et al. [2024] rely on predefined database state comparisons, such methods cannot capture nuanced requirements such as recommendations or planning behaviors that leave final states unchanged, nor provide supervision for intermediate transitions. Recent rubric-based evaluation methods [Arora et al., 2025, Ruan et al., 2025] inspire our approach by decomposing complex goals into atomic criteria, enabling comprehensive requirement coverage. With carefully-designed rubrics, LLM-as-a-Judge can effectively replace fine-grained human judgments while maintaining high accuracy. To address the challenge that multi-turn trajectories often exceed context lengths, we propose sliding window evaluator that processes trajectories in sequential segments while maintaining continuity through persistent rubric state tracking. 2While the tasks are grounded in real-world life-serving platforms where the majority of data is originally in Chinese, we are also preparing an English version of the dataset to facilitate broader research use. Ongoing updates, including evaluation results, will be provided on the project website. 5 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark Table 2: Data statistics of VitaBench. Cross-Scen.

Nevertheless, the fine-grained rubrics enable detailed scoring analysis for identifying trajectory differences, providing valuable dense signals for reinforcement learning. Human evaluation yields strong inter-rater agreement with Cohens κ 0.81 [Cohen, 1960] as shown in Section 6.1, validating the reliability of our approach."

We can observe that: Real-world tasks pose great challenges for current agents. Performance varies significantly across domains and correlates strongly with environmental complexity. Cross-scenario tasks expose the most severe limitations: even top-performing models achieve only 30.0% Avg@4 score, compared to over 50% in single-domain settings. This dramatic gap reveals fundamental deficiencies in navigating expanded action spaces and coordinating across distinct domains. Notably, task difficulty does not correlate with database scalethe in-store domain, despite having far more products, proves easier than delivery settings. This counterintuitive finding shows how real-world complexity emerges: delivery tasks demand precise coordination of multiple items under strict constraints, while in-store operations remain straightforward despite larger candidate pools. Exploration improves performance but reveals stability issues. The Pass@k and Passˆk metrics capture complementary aspects of model behavior. Pass@4 results show that increased sampling substantially improves completion rates, indicating that complex environments reward exploration, which suggests promising directions for RL approaches. However, Passˆ4 metrics reveal concerning instability, with even top models dropping to near-zero consistency rates. To 3DeepSeek-V3.1 only supports tool calling in non-thinking mode. 4Due to API stability concerns, we are currently unable to evaluate some models for this benchmark. We are actively working to address these issues and include the latest models. The most up-to-date results can be found on the project website. 7 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark Figure 4: Pass@k vs. Passˆk performance. Figure 5: Model performance vs. Turns.

Figure 7: MSE stability across different evaluation run counts. further validate this observation, we evaluate representative models with = 32 samples (Figure 4), confirming that while exploration yields marginal gains, fundamental stability challenges persist even for leading agentic models like Claude-4-Sonnet. Thinking mechanisms improve both effectiveness and efficiency. Thinking models generally outperform their non-thinking versions, with improvements such as Claude-4.1-Opus increasing from 21.8% to 29.0% and GLM-4.5 from 20.0% to 22.8%. Moreover, thinking mechanisms lead to efficiency improvements, as shown in Figure 5 where thinking models tend to achieve better performance with fewer turns on average. For instance, the overall trend demonstrates that higher-performing models require fewer interaction turns, with thinking models achieving an average performance of 23.8% compared to 17.9% for non-thinking models, while maintaining comparable turn counts (61.1 vs 69.9 turns respectively). This efficiency gain stems from two factors: better decomposition of complex multi-step plans and more targeted user interactions through precise clarifying questions."

            "content": "6.1 Reliability Analysis of VitaBench Components Given that our benchmark incorporates model-based components for user simulation and trajectory evaluation, we conduct reliability analyses to validate their effectiveness and stability. Reliability of user simulator. We evaluate our user simulator across two critical dimensions: information fidelity and persona consistency. For information fidelity, two annotators assess 100 conversations examining adherence to task instructions and user profiles, absence of hallucinations, and contextual relevance. As shown in Figure 6(a), the simulator achieves high fidelity with 9.48/10 average score across all scenarios. Minor deviations manifest as natural conversational variations (e.g., cannot eat spicy vs. prefer non-spicy food) that enhance dialogue authenticity without compromising task requirements. Notably, the simulator appropriately responds dont know when queried about unprovided information, maintaining strict source fidelity. For persona consistency, we test five distinct personality types across 100 conversations, measuring behavioral alignment through language style, decision 8 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark Table 4: Ablation study of evaluator components.

Figure 6(b) demonstrates strong persona-behavior alignment averaging 9.34/10. Cooperative personas exhibit the highest consistency, aligning with LLMs inherent collaborative tendencies, while scattered personas show lower controllability. Reliability of evaluator. We conduct ablation experiments to validate our rubric-based sliding window evaluator on GLM-4.5s cross-scenario trajectories. Table 4 compares four configurations against human-annotated ground truth: (1) baseline with sliding window and rubric, (2) full trajectory with rubric, (3) sliding window without rubric, and (4) full trajectory without rubric. For configuration (3), we employ external memory module to maintain context awareness. The result shows that our proposed method achieves the highest agreement with human judgments (Cohens κ = 0.828), significantly outperforming methods without rubric structure (κ < 0.07). While full trajectory with rubric yields similar final scores (19% vs. 20%), the evaluation models limited long-context capability hinders accurate assessment of all rubrics in the full trajectory. The sliding window design effectively handles this while maintaining 95% task-level accuracy, confirming the reliability of our approach. Statistical reliability of evaluation. Beyond the aforementioned components, evaluation reliability is further affected by inherent agent stochasticity. Despite setting temperature to 0.0, cumulative perturbations in multi-turn interactions amplify into divergent trajectories. To determine the optimal number of evaluation runs, we conduct resampling analysis based on 32 independent trials. For each [1, 20], we calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of k-run average estimates relative to the expected value (32-run average) by sampling different k-combinations from the 32 trials. Figure 7 demonstrates that = 4 runs achieve optimal balance between statistical precision and computational cost. Compared to = 1, using = 4 reduces MSE by 77.5%, while increasing to = 8 only provides marginal reduction despite doubling computational overhead. So we choose 4 evaluation runs for the main experiments. 6.2 Task Complexity Analysis Reasoning and Tool Complexity. We analyze how reasoning complexity Creason and tool complexity Ctool affect task difficulty. Table 5 summarizes complexity characteristics and performance across four domains. Reasoning complexity depends on both the number of reasoning points and search space size. Cross-scenario and OTA tasks require 10.3 and 9.7 reasoning points respectively, demanding complex inference under partial observability. Despite having the largest search space, the In-store domain achieves the highest performance (42.1%) due to fewer reasoning points. Tool complexity strongly correlates with task difficulty: Cross-scenario tasks, with the highest tool complexity (66 tools, 512 dependency edges), yield the lowest performance (16.2%). The OTA domains 22% graph density indicates complex inter-tool dependencies, resulting in poor performance (20.7%). Interactive Complexity. We conduct ablation studies to quantify interaction complexity Cinteract, evaluating two models under three conditions: (1) our default user simulator with full persona and behavioral attributes, (2) user simulator without these attributes (neutral user), and (3) solo agent setting where complete instructions are provided upfront without user interaction. 9 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark Figure 8: Ablation study of user simulation configurations. Figure 9: Error distribution of VitaBench. As shown in Figure 8, user interaction introduces substantial complexity beyond direct task execution. The performance gap between default and neutral users is relatively small for Claude-4-Sonnet compared to GPT-4.1-Mini, suggesting that conversational styles primarily challenge weaker models. Conversely, Claude-4-Sonnet gains more in solo agent mode, indicating that it excels at processing complex instructions in single round. These findings validate interaction complexity as fundamental dimension of task difficulty, with its impact varying significantly based on model capabilities. 6.3 Error Pattern Analysis in VitaBench To understand the failure modes of current agents on VitaBench, we analyze cross-scenario task trajectories from Claude-4.1-Opus, categorizing 76 failed rubrics into distinct error patterns. We classify the failures into three main categories aligned with our agentic task complexity framework, as illustrated in Figure 9. Reasoning errors (61.8%) dominate the failure landscape, revealing fundamental limitations in task decisionmaking and handling composite objectives with multiple constraints. Tool-use errors (21.1%) stem from incorrect tool selection, parameter passing mistakes, and inability to recover from invocation failures. Interaction errors (7.9%) reflect challenges in dialogue management, where agents fail to proactively clarify ambiguous requirements and lose track of user preferences across extended conversations. The remaining 9.2% are user simulator errors, an inherent stochastic behavior that we mitigate through multiple runs [Yao et al., 2024]. From these failures, we identify several recurring patterns that highlight weaknesses in current agents. First, complex reasoning failures occur systematically across spatial-temporal and common-sense reasoning, indicating limited ability to integrate knowledge across multi-faceted information. Second, agents exhibit poor self-awareness of their capabilities, frequently abandoning tasks despite having access to appropriate tools, revealing fundamental gaps in understanding their own action boundaries. Third, agents show limited error recovery when facing tool failures or unclear user responses, with most repeating failed attempts rather than adapting other strategies."

By formalizing agentic task complexity across reasoning, tool use, and interaction dimensions, VitaBench provides the most intricate life-serving simulation environment to date with 66 tools and 400 tasks spanning singleand cross-scenario settings. Our evaluation reveals that even advanced models achieve only 30% success rate under cross-scenario settings (main result) and less than 50% success rate under single-scenario settings. We believe VitaBench offers challenging testbed and actionable insights for advancing real-world agent applications. 10 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark"

            "content": "We identify nine traits across three complexity dimensions that characterize related benchmarks. Multifaceted Information: Tasks require integrating temporal and spatial information, common-sense knowledge, and understanding of various environmental components to form coherent solutions. Composite Objective: Tasks involve multiple interdependent sub-goals derived from user requirements that must be coordinated across different aspects (e.g., booking flights, hotels, and activities within budget constraints). Goal Ambiguity: User inputs may be underspecified or vague, requiring agents to proactively seek clarification, infer missing information, or iteratively refine their understanding through dialogue. # Tools: The number of distinct tools or APIs available. Larger tool inventories increase selection complexity and require understanding diverse functionalities. Inter-tool Dependency: Tools exhibit dependencies through pre-conditions (states required before execution) and post-conditions (outcomes after execution), requiring agents to plan multi-step execution strategies. Cross Scenarios: Measures whether the benchmark enables flexible composition of multiple domains, requiring agents to navigate between distinct contexts rather than relying on domain-specific patterns. # Turns: The approximate number of trajectory turns required. Longer trajectories test context maintenance and handling of progressively revealed information throughout multi-turn conversations. User Profile: Persistent user profiles encode personal attributes (e.g., age, gender) and preferences that influence task requirements (e.g., dietary restrictions), necessitating personalized agent responses. Behavior Attributes: Modeling diverse user behavioral patterns including emotional expressions (e.g., impatient, anxious), interaction patterns (e.g., detail-oriented, dependent), and dynamic engagement levels based on agent performance such as reduced willingness to respond when receiving repetitive answers."

The restaurant is about 1.6km from Dalian Port, so please allow sufficient time to get to the boarding point after dining. Would you like me to send you reminder 1 hour before boarding, or help you check the taxi route and estimated time from the restaurant to the boarding point? Please let me know if you have no other requirements. User [18] The restaurant is booked. Theres one more thing - we have elderly people traveling with us, and want to receive some special travel items at the restaurant, like walking canes and adult diapers. Its too troublesome to bring them over, so want delivery around 12 oclock to the restaurant, then take them directly onto the ship. Which platform do you recommend for ordering that would be convenient? Assistant [19] recommend prioritizing JD Daojia (JD Home) for your order, with Meituan Flash Purchase or Ele.me (Flash Purchase/Pharmacy Home Delivery) as alternatives. Why this choice: JD Daojia (First choice): Chain pharmacies and medical equipment stores have wide coverage, with relatively complete selection of walking canes, adult diapers and other elderly care products. They generally support ontime/scheduled delivery (you can choose time windows like 11:45-12:15), providing better assurance for \"delivery around 12 oclock.\" Meituan Flash Purchase: Strong same-city instant fulfillment capability, many nearby pharmacies/equipment stores, fast delivery; some merchants also support scheduled delivery. Ele.me (Flash Purchase/Pharmacy Home Delivery): Similar to Meituan, instant delivery, many pharmacy resources, depending on merchant support for scheduling. Practical suggestions (regardless of platform choice): Address: Set delivery address as \"Harbor Family Feast Restaurant, No. 5 Harbor Plaza, Zhongshan District,\" with note \"Please call upon arrival, reservation number OIe6a7029150, 6 people dining, near accessible pathway,\" and keep phone accessible. Order timing & delivery: Suggest placing order on the morning of the 27th, choose scheduled delivery 11:45-12:15 (or closest time window to 12:00); if merchant doesnt support scheduling, suggest ordering at 11:20-11:30 and confirming with delivery person by phone. Product selection & split orders: Walking canes are usually easier to find at \"medical equipment/rehabilitation equipment\" stores; adult diapers have more options at \"chain pharmacies/large supermarkets.\" Youll likely need to split into two orders to ensure both arrive on time. Backup plan: If still not delivered by 12:20, contact delivery person to discuss reassignment/nearby pickup to avoid affecting subsequent boarding. Would you like me to organize search keywords and merchant type lists for JD Daojia/Meituan Flash Purchase to help you order quickly? Please let me know if you have no other requirements. 20 VitaBench: Versatile Interactive Tasks Benchmark User [20] Please help me place orders directly on JD Daojia - one walking cane and one pack of adult diapers, delivered to Harbor Family Feast Restaurant, delivery time around 12 oclock. Split orders are fine, just dont delay.

The reason is that from Dalian North Station to Harbor Family Feast Restaurant is about 2.3km direct distance, very close journey, door-to-door without transfers, saving effort and worry for elderly and children; subway requires station entry/exit, security checks, and going up/down stairs + walking, not as convenient as taxi. Specific Arrangement Departure Point: Dalian North Station (after getting off and exiting, follow signs to \"Taxi/Ride-hailing Pickup Point\") Destination: Harbor Family Feast Restaurant, No. 5 Harbor Plaza, Zhongshan District Restaurant Verification: Reservation number OIe6a7029150 (12:00 dining) Backup Plan: If taxi queue at the station is long, can directly call ride-hailing to station pickup point; if really inconvenient to wait for car, walking about 2.3km, but considering elderly and children, walking not recommended. Do you need me to send \"take taxi immediately upon exiting station\" reminder when your aunts train arrives, or organize the above destination information into text message template to send to her? If you have no other requirements, Ill record this plan for your reminders. User [59] Please organize the taxi route and restaurant address into text message template that can send directly to my aunt. Also need arrival reminders, dont forget. Assistant [60] Good, Ive organized the text message template for you and set up arrival reminders.

If you want me to send on your behalf, youd need to provide your aunts phone number and authorization, but current channels dont support direct external messaging, so Ill ensure no omissions through chat reminders.
