            "title": "1 Introduction\nEvaluating personalized recommender systems remains a funda-\nmental challenge, largely due to the limitations of offline evaluations\nmethods and metrics [14]. Standard metrics like hit rate and recall\nare based on historical interaction data, which introduces exposure\nbias: models are evaluated only on items users have previously\nseen, not the full space of potential recommendations. This makes\nit difficult to accurately assess a model’s true effectiveness.",
            "content": "These shortcomings are especially pronounced in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of new features (e.g., new podcast shelf), where no historical interaction data exists. In such cases, offline metrics fail, and practitioners must rely on qualitative assessments to estimate alignment with the intended user experience before launch. At the other extreme, A/B testing and user studies, while grounded in real behavior, are costly, slow, and operationally constrained, limiting the number of models that can be practically tested. As result, practitioners face dilemma: fast but limited offline evaluation, or rigorous but slow experimentation. This reveals critical gap: the lack of scalable, reliable middle ground for pre-deployment model selection. Traditional evaluation methods, whether quantitative or qualitative, also fall short in capturing true user satisfaction or explaining why recommendation is relevant. Crucially, they fail to determine whether recommendation meaningfully reflects users underlying preferences. This challenge is especially acute in the podcast domain, where the cost of poor recommendation is high [8]; unlike short-form content, podcasts require considerable attention. RecSys 25, September 2226, 2025, Prague, Czech Republic Fabbri et al. Implicit feedback, such as stopping after ten minutes, can signal strong disinterest, mild curiosity, or simple distraction, making interpretation highly ambiguous. Unlike search, where evaluation checks whether retrieved results satisfy an explicit user query, recommendation must infer intent entirely from behavioral traces. In search, the query serves as content hypothesis, direct expression of the users information need. In verticals like music from the 80s, the scope is often predefined by the domain or interface. But in personalized recommendation, especially for long-form content, no such explicit formulation of user intent exists. This challenge is particularly acute in podcast recommendation, where user preferences span multiple dimensionsincluding topic, tone, format, and host styleand are difficult to infer from sparse interaction data. The core evaluation task, therefore, becomes one of constructing content hypothesis: an interpretable approximation of what the user prefers, inferred from past listening behavior. We propose that this missing hypothesis can be explicitly constructed in the form of natural-language user profile: structured summary of topical interests, stylistic preferences, and behavioral patterns distilled from listening history. These profiles provide high-level, interpretable context that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason more effectively about whether recommendation aligns with inferred user intent. LLMs offer promising path forward for scalable, human-aligned evaluation [6]. Models like GPT-4 [2, 15] show high agreement with human judgments across diverse tasks [20], and the LLM-as-aJudge paradigm is emerging as general evaluation strategy [21]. LLMs can assess relevance in relation to user preferences [17, 18]. However, prior work often feeds raw interaction data to the LLM or assumes structured ground-truth signals, limiting interpretability. Recent work on personalized judges [3] highlights the limitations of generic LLM-based evaluation when user context is underspecified. This underscores the need for profile-aware prompting strategies that encode nuanced, personalized context. We argue that structured, profile-based representations enable more faithful alignment evaluation, and unlock the full potential of LLMs as offline judges for personalized systems, especially for pre-deployment settings, where traditional online experimentation is too costly, slow, or operationally infeasible. Our Approach. To address this challenge, we introduce profileaware LLM-as-a-Judge framework (Judge throughout the paper) for evaluating personalized podcast episode recommendations. Central to our framework is natural-language profile automatically distilled from each users listening history, which serves as an explicit content hypothesis representing the users inferred preferences. The LLM is prompted with this profile and candidate episode metadata to reason about alignment along multiple dimensions, such as topic, tone, and format. The framework supports two complementary evaluation modes: (1) Pointwise evaluation: the Judge assesses whether an individual episode aligns with the users inferred preferences. (2) Pairwise evaluation: in setup analogous to A/B testing, the Judge compares two ranked episode lists, each from different model, and select the one better aligned with the profile. Together, these evaluation modes offer scalable, interpretable mechanism for judging recommendation quality, bridging the gap between coarse offline metrics and more subjective, human-aligned assessments of user satisfaction."

            "content": "Concerns about bias and misalignment have also been raised. Ye et al. [21] cataloged systematic biases in LLM judgments, and Sahoo et al. [11] propose post-hoc regression calibration techniques. Thakur et al. [13] highlighted gaps in alignment and prompt sensitivity across judge models. While our work focuses on profile-based alignment, we do not explicitly address these issues. Investigating bias mitigation and prompt robustness is an important direction for future work. In information retrieval, Thomas et al. [14] showed that GPT-4 can predict document relevance with near-human accuracy. However, applying LLMs to recommendation introduces additional challenges: user preferences must be inferred from behavior over time, and recommendations lack an explicit query to ground evaluation. Our framework addresses this by constructing natural-language profiles that act as explicit content hypotheses: structured representations of inferred user intent, enabling LLMs to evaluate alignment in personalized, dynamic settings. Related work by Dong et al. [3] found that persona-conditioned prompting improves evaluation in dialogue tasks. Our approach differs in two ways: (𝑖) we apply LLM-based judgment to ranking in personalized recommendation rather than conversation quality, and (𝑖𝑖) our user profiles are automatically distilled from behavioral traces, not manually crafted. Finally, Jones et al. [8] highlighted lack of scalable offline evaluation methods for podcast recommendations. Our work directly addresses this gap by introducing profile-aware LLM-as-a-Judge framework, along with open tools to support evaluation in longform, preference-driven media domains."

The system takes as input user profile synthesized from listening history and two sets of recommended episodes, and outputs rationales and binary judgments for episode-level fit and model-level comparison. gaps. Although prior work has called for richer evaluation frameworks, few offer scalable solutions for detecting recommendation misalignment [8]. To address this, we introduce profile-aware evaluation framework that leverages LLMs as interpretable, domain-adaptive offline judges. Rather than relying on item-level engagement signals (e.g., clicks or listens), our approach uses structured natural-language profiles distilled from listening history to assess how well recommended episode aligns with users topical interests and behavioral patterns. This bridges the gap between nuanced relevance criteria and the scalability needs of offline evaluation, offering practical alternative to coarse numerical proxies. The framework operates in two key stages: user profiling and episode assessment. In the first stage, we generate structured profile for each user based on their most recent three months of listening activity. This profile is derived from podcast metadata (including titles, descriptions, transcripts, and topical tags) associated with episodes and shows the user has engaged with most. The profile captures two main dimensions: Content preferences: topical and named-entity focus, crossdomain curiosity, and tendencies toward exploration or specialization Listening patterns: habits, engagement depth, and format preferences. These six attributes form comprehensive user representation, which is then used for evaluating alignment with candidate episodes  (Fig. 2)  . In the second stage the Judge, an off-the-shelf LLM queried in zero-shot mode (i.e., no fine-tuning or calibration), is prompted with both the user profile and the metadata of recommended episode. Using Chain-of-Thought reasoning style, the Judge produces rationale and binary judgment indicating whether the episode is good fit; this constitutes the pointwise evaluation [19]. While Figure 2: Profile generation prompt. The LLM receives structured listening metadata and is prompted to produce natural-language user profile with interpretable dimensions (e.g., listening habits, format preference). This profile is later used as input for evaluating recommendation relevance. we also tested multiclass version (including neutral feedback), it yielded no substantial improvement and is omitted for brevity. For model-level evaluation, the Judge performs pairwise comparisons between two ranked lists of episodes, each generated by different recommendation model, and selects the list that better matches the user profile. This setup is designed to compare models with different architectures but similar optimization goals. For each comparison, the Judge provides: (1) dimension-wise qualitative rationale outlining the strengths and weaknesses of each list; and (2) final verdict, either preferring one model or indicating tie when neither shows clear superiority. To mitigate position bias, the identity tags of Model and Model are randomly shuffled before each evaluation, ensuring an unbiased and reliable comparison."

            "content": "Setup. To evaluate the validity of our framework, referred to throughout this section as LaaJ (LLM-as-a-Judge), we conduct controlled experiment with real users to assess whether it can serve as reliable offline judge on recommendation quality. The experiment involved two anonymized models (Model and Model B), 47 participants, and two-stage evaluation comparing LLM-generated judgments with human feedback per user. Each participant first receives personalized profile, automatically generated from their podcast listening history. Then, two sets of episode recommendations are generated, one for each model, and displayed side-by-side. Each set includes 3 episodes per model, with each episode shown alongside its show name, description, cover image, and playable audio segment. Through the survey interface, users can provided structured feedback on: (1) the accuracy of their profile; (2) how well each episode aligns with their interests; (3) which model better matches their preferences overall. Participants rated each item using 5-point Likert scale: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, and Strongly Agree. To ensure unbiased feedback, all participants were blinded to the identity of the models. The LLM Judge was prompted using static templates, with no fine-tuning or post-hoc calibration applied [22].

Table 1: Performance on both episode and model evaluations of different judges on the human-labeled dataset. W/T/L counts wins, ties, and losses against the human label. The compared models differ in architecture: (1) Model A, which was primarily content-based, with less sensitivity to consumption patterns, and (2) Model B, which relied heavily on collaborative filtering signals, with limited content-based integration. For all experiments we used GPT-4.1 [1] for both the user profile generator and the judging model. We chose it for its reported strong alignment with human preferences, consistent performance across evaluation tasks, and better correlation with human judgments than other LLMs [10, 23]. LLM Agreement & Judgment Behavior. We present comparison between the output of the Judge and the human-annotated data. From 47 users included in the study, we collect in total 277 pointwise human evaluations and 47 model-level comparisons (one per user). The dataset covers 227 unique recommended episodes, with an average of 5.89 episode annotations per user. In our evaluation we test three different judges, including two LaaJ variants, and non-LLM one: LaaJ-Profile (our profile-aware judge): uses structured, natural-language summary of each users listening history, distilled from their top shows and episodes. Profiles serve as an interpretable content hypothesis, capturing topical preferences, stylistic traits, and behavioral patterns, to guide the LLMs reasoning about alignment, without requiring access to raw interaction data. LaaJ-History: variant that provides the LLM with the full set of shows and episodes from the users listening history, rather than distilled profile. This approach tests whether reasoning directly over raw behavioral traces leads to better alignment judgments, and serves as baseline for evaluating the benefits of compressing user preferences into structured, interpretable profile. sBERT-Sim: non-LLM baseline that computes cosine similarity between Sentence-BERT embeddings of the user profile and episode metadata. Episodes are marked aligned if similarity exceeds fixed threshold (0.5), and model-level alignment is determined by aggregating episode-level scores. This serves as simple, interpretable proxy for content-level user-item relevance. Table 1 presents results from both episode-level and modellevel evaluations. The pointwise evaluation is conducted on 277 annotated episodes. We report the following metrics: ROC-AUC measures the accuracy of the judges on user-episode predictions; Model Selection Agreement (MSA) is the fraction of cases where the judges model preference matches annotators choices; Outcome Distribution is the number of Wins, Ties, and Losses for the judge compared to ground-truth human annotations; and Recall of Strong Figure 3: Confusion matrices comparing the profile-aware LaaJ-Profile with human annotations. Columns represent LLM decisions; rows show human relevance labels. Left: episode-level (pointwise) comparison. Right: model-level (pairwise) comparison. Misalignment (RSM) is the proportion of strongly misaligned recommendations flagged by the judges also identified by annotators as clearly misaligned with user preferences. As shown Table 1, LaaJ-Profile achieves comparable ROC-AUC to LaaJ-History, despite relying solely on natural-language profile rather than the user history. This demonstrates that concise, interpretable representation of user preferences can serve as an effective content hypothesis that captures the essence of user intent. In model-level comparisons, the profile-based variant outperforms the history-based, underscoring the value of summarizing multifaceted user interests for reliable comparative judgments between recommendation models. Additionally, both LLM-based judges correctly identify 66% of strongly misaligned episodes (per the RSM metric), indicating sensitivity to recommendations that conflict with user preferences. Continuing our analysis of LaaJ-Profile, we examine its confusion matrices against human annotations  (Fig. 3)  . In episode-level evaluation, the matrix (left) shows alignment in 75% of the cases. However, 17% of the episodes were judged as aligned by the LLM but not by users (representing false positives). This discrepancy reflects known tendency of LLMs to produce positively skewed responses [5, 24]. In the model-level (pairwise) evaluation, the confusion matrix (right) reveals strong agreement between the Judge and human annotators in preferring Model over Model B, with 20 true positives out of 24 comparisons. However, the LLM tends to be more decisive: it registers only one tie, in contrast to the eight ties recorded by human annotators. This tendency may be addressed through more adaptive in-context learning strategies or by model fine-tuning [16]. Qualitative feedback from human annotators revealed their judgments were influenced by factors beyond standard evaluation metrics, such as familiarity with the show, the identity of the host, stylistic tone, and the diversity of the recommendations. While some users preferred narrowly focused and familiar recommendation lists, others placed higher value on variety and novelty. These findings highlight the complex, multi-dimensional, and inherently subjective nature of podcast preferences in real-world settings. Impact of User Profiles.

This emphasizes the critical role of context richness and profile coverage in enabling the LLM to make accurate evaluations. Participants were asked to review their automatically generated profiles in LaaJ-Profile and evaluate how well they reflected their listening preferences. As shown in Fig. 4, most agreed the profiles offered reasonable high-level summary, but views were more divided on how accurately the profiles captured their deeper interests. Quantitative ratings indicated the profiles were broadly representative, yet qualitative feedback added nuance. While many users recognized that key aspects of their listening behavior were captured, some expressed concerns about the depth and specificity of representation. Some users pointed to missing personal elements such as favorite hosts, limited coverage of stylistic tone, and narrow topical focusoften shaped by recent listening activity. These observations reflect the difficulty of inferring subjective preferences from short or sparse interaction histories, as well as the trade-off between recency and long-term interest modeling. Several participants noted that short-term data windows sometimes failed to reflect enduring tastes. These insights point to opportunities for enhancing profiles by incorporating long-term behavioral signals and more nuanced metadata."
