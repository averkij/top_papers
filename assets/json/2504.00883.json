            "content": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as significant advancement in AI. They typically accept text, images, and videos as inputs and output textual responses, serving as the foundations for various applications, including multi-modal understanding (Liu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a), visual language agents (Hong et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b), autonomous driving (Pan et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c), etc. The exhaustive understanding of multi-modal observations hinges on advanced reasoning capabilities, which has spurred growing interest in investigating reasoning mechanisms within MLLMs (SurÄ±s et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). This trend mirrors concurrent advancements in vanilla LLMs (Yao et al., 2023; Lightman et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al.). As the foundation for AI agents operating in the physical world, the video-based visual-spatial reasoning stands out as one of the most crucial capacities of MLLMs. Yet, existing models often fall short in this (see VSI-bench (Yang et al., 2024)). This work conducts systematic study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of MLLMs based on R1-Zero-like training. Focusing on the Qwen2-VL models (Wang et al., 2024a), we first perform an initial study on whether simple reasoning-oriented prompts can activate the visual-spatial reasoning capacities. We investigate various CoT (Wei et al., 2022) strategies, but find that vanilla non-CoT prompts perform the best for smallto medium-sized Qwen2-VL on VSI-bench. This exposes the issue that such models does not have the ability to trade inference FLOPs for improved visual-spatial reasoning. Works done during the internship in OPPO AI Center.

Following the journey of DeepSeek-R1-Zero (Guo et al., 2025), we decide to improve the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of Qwen2-VL with GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). Considering the scarcity of training data for visual-spatial question answering, we construct videobased question answering dataset of more than 100k samples, VSI-100k, following the protocol of VSI-bench. Specifically, we leverage ScanNet (Dai et al., 2017) to get highfidelity video scans accompanied by meticulous object-level 3D annotations, based on which (question, answer) pairs regarding spatial information can be easily crafted. Following common practice (Guo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), we define the rule-based reward function based on the alignment between the model prediction and the ground-truth answer to perform GRPO. We also include format reward when trying to activate the CoT reasoning behaviour. The GRPO on VSI-100k turns the pretrained Qwen2-VL-2B model into the performant vsGRPO-2B within just 120 GPU hours. We observe that vsGRPO-2B outperforms the base model by 12.1%. The same pipeline also transforms the Qwen2-VL-7B model into vsGRPO-7B, achieving performance similar to that of the best open-source model with 72B parameters. During GRPO training, we have identified the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with small value) in the training of GRPO and observed phenomena such as reward hacking. We also compare GRPO with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), and confirm the superiority of GRPO in improving the spatial-visual reasoning capacities of Qwen2-VL."

            "title": "2 Can Visual-spatial Reasoning Capacities Be Activated by Prompting?",
            "content": "We initiate by evaluating Qwen2-VL on the VSI-bench with various prompting strategies. Concretely, the VSI-bench includes two types of question-answer problems: Numerical Answer (NA), including tasks such as object counting, absolute distance measurement, object size evaluation, and room size assessment; Multiple-Choice Answer (MCA), including tasks related to relative distance, relative direction, route planning, and appearance order. To evaluate the reasoning capacities of Qwen2-VL on this dataset, we consider two CoT prompting strategies: the widely adopted think-mode, where the model first thinks and then replies to the question, and the observe-mode, where the model first observes the input video and then replies. The latter follows human-like pattern and has been explored in related works (Wu et al., 2024). We also include non-CoT vanilla-mode for comparison. Here is summarization of them: Think-mode: Lets think step by step and then answer the question using single word or phrase. Observe-mode: Please observe the video first and then answer the question using single word or phrase. Vanilla-mode: Please answer the question using single word or phrase. 2 Figure 1: Comparison between the vanilla-mode and think-mode predictions. CoT prompting is ineffective for smallto medium-sized Qwen2-VL on VSI-bench. As shown in Table 1, despite longer responses, think-mode and observe-mode underperform the simple vanilla-mode. Namely, smallto medium-sized Qwen2-VL cannot trade inference FLOPs for improved visual-spatial reasoning. We visualize some output examples given by Qwen2-VL-2B in Figure 1. We see that the model can actually understand the instructions for activating thinking, but the final answer is still wrong, the same as that of the vanilla prompting. From the exposed chain of thoughts, we realize that the error may arise from the failure to perceive the sofa in the video."

            "content": "We first create video-based question-answering dataset named VSI-100k for visual-spatial It consists of more than 100k samples and follows the VSI-bench protocol. reasoning. Specifically, we utilize ScanNet (Dai et al., 2017) to obtain high-fidelity video scans that come with detailed object-level 3D annotations. With such information, it becomes straightforward to generate (question, answer) pairs related to spatial information. Specifically, we construct questions regarding six topics, including object count, relative direction, relative distance, object size, room size, and absolute distance. We leave the other two topics in VSI-bench, route planning and appearance order, held out. This corresponds to two reasons: 1) (question, answer) pairs of the latter two topics cannot be simply constructed given rarely the static 3D information, which implies that expensive manual annotation can be required; 2) with this, we can test the task generalization ability of the trained models. For the NA type problems, we implement question template similar to that used in (Yang et al., 2024). For the MCA one, we simplify the question format by removing the options. This adjustment enhances the models capacity to recognize entity correspondence instead of simply matching symbols. Some examples are provided in Figure 2. For object count, we construct answers with directly the object labels included in the annotations document, yielding total of 6.4k samples. For absolute distance, we first remove objects that appear multiple times to ensure specification preciseness, and then calculate the distance between geometric centers of various 3D point-cloud objects, obtaining 3 Figure 2: Illustrations of the constructed dataset. 75k samples. For relative distance, we fix one targeted object and compute the absolute distance between it and four other objects to estimate relative distance, yielding 13k samples. For relative direction, we select one object as the front and determine the relative direction of two objects based on their geometric centers of point clouds, getting total of 8k samples. For object size, we leverage the 3D bounding box to compute the longest dimension of the object, yielding total of 13k samples. For room size, we apply the alpha shape algorithm to the total 1.5k scenes, resulting in 1.5k samples."

Although the CoT prompts are useless for the small-sized Qwen2-VL-2B in inference time, we still wonder if training with them is beneficial for GRPO.

In the case of non-NA tasks, we employ character matching method to assess accuracy, awarding score of 1 for match and 0 for mismatch. For NA tasks, we develop function that computes the absolute difference between the true value and the predicted one and divides the result by the minimum of the two values. Experimental Settings. Unless specified otherwise, we use Qwen2-VL-2B/7B as the base models due to resource constraints. We employ LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) training with learning rate of 105 for Qwen2-VL-2B and 5 106 for Qwen2-VL-7B. We conduct 14 rollouts per question and set the default sampling temperature to 1.

We evaluate them with the corresponding test prompts by default. Given the studies in the previous section, we also test the trained models with vanilla-mode prompts. As shown in Table 2, for models based on Qwen-VL-2B, all GRPO fine-tuned models improve over the baseline. Besides, for the models trained with CoT prompting strategies, their CoT test performance outperforms vanilla one. This indicates that GRPO training can effectively enhance the models long reasoning capabilities. Notably, directly applying the vanilla-mode prompting strategy yields the best performance improvements, particularly for NA questions, and even outperforms GPT-4o. We refer to this model as vsGRPO-2B by default. This underscores the conclusion that CoT prompting is ineffective for the small-sized Qwen2-VL-2B on the VSI-bench. In terms of Qwen2-VL-7B, we only tried vsGRPO-V considering the above results. We observe that vsGRPO-V performs the best on two subtasksobject counting and absolute distance. Moreover, the test performance on the Route Plan is also improved, similar to the 2B case. This is possibly because the Route Plan can be divided into sub-tasks that include relative direction, indicating inter-task generalization. With only 7B model size, we note that our model shows performance comparable to that of the leading open-source model, LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B (Li et al., 2024)."

It avoids the model straying too far from the initial point. While some works (Yu et al., 2025; Meng et al., 2025) advocate for removing the KL penalty to enhance performance, we have observed that doing so can easily lead to training collapse, as illustrated in Figure 3 (left). In contrast, introducing positive Î² (even very small, such as 0.0001) can effectively address this issue. This may be attributed to the specific nature of VSI reasoning problems."

One example is that when training with observe-mode, there are some extreme samples in the rollouts, e.g., <think> </think> <answer>xx</answer>. While this format is technically correct, it degrades to missing observation. Observing this, we opt to incorporate length reward function for mitigation. However, we note that some new generations just add extra <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags to exploit the length reward, which does not contribute to meaningful thinking process. So, more reasonable reward functions should be explored."

As shown, the two approaches both improve over the base model on the VSI-bench, but still lag behind GRPO-V. Besides, the improvement of DPO is minor, which is perhaps because of the sub-optimal preference pair construction."
