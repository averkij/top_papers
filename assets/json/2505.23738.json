            "content": "Everything in the universe has rhythm; everything dances. Maya Angelou Humans dance spontaneously to musicjust picture toddler cheerfully bouncing to the beats at birthday party. Animals can dance too; Snowball the cockatoo  (Fig. 2)  can perform up to 14 distinct dance movements in response to different musical cues [Keehn et al. 2019]. In fact, our animal friends are probably dancing all the time when were not looking. In this paper, we capture this hidden world of animal dance, and expose it for the first time to the human population  (Fig. 1)  . While we happen to be particularly obsessed with dancing animals, this paper introduces new framework for generating musicsynchronized, highly structured, 30 second+ long dance videos. Such capabilities are challenging for current state of the art generative models, most of which are limited to short clips of few seconds, do not produced synchronized audio and video, and lack intuitive controls for long range motion. Beyond text prompting, most controls for video generation are fine-grained and operate on single frame at time, e.g., body pose, camera pose, motion brushes, etc. 2 Xiaojuan Wang, Aleksander Holynski, Brian Curless, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, and Steven M. Seitz Fig. 2. Snowball the cockatoo: real bird that can dance. In contrast, we introduce choreography patterns as new control for video generation. Specifically, we allow the user to specify structured sequence of dance moves, or beats, e.g., A-B-A-B-C-D-A, where each letter corresponds to particular move, and constrain the motion in the video to follow that choreography. Furthermore, we show how these choreography patterns can be automatically estimated from existing (human) dance videos. well-formed dance follows basic choreographic rules [Chen et al. 2021], which structure the movements to align with the rhythmic flow of the accompanying music, and often involve recurring patterns such as mirroring and repetition to help reinforce the musical structure [Kim et al. 2006, 2003]. We leverage this inherent structure of dance to make the generation task more tractable. As input, we use collection of initially generated keyframes, each representing distinct pose. We then formulate the dance synthesis as graph optimization problem, i.e., find the optimized walk path through the keyframes to satisfy specified choreography pattern of beats. Each selected keyframe in the path is aligned to musical beat. The final dance video is produced by synthesizing in-between frames between the keyframes using generative video inbetweening model [Wang et al. 2024a,b]  (Fig. 3)  . Beyond 1) introducing new type of generative video control (choreography patterns), and 2) practical system for generating music-synchronized dance videos, this paper makes the following technical contributions. First, we introduce technique for inferring choreography patterns from human dance videos, such as those found on Youtube and TikTok. Second, we formulate the satisfaction of these constraints as graph optimization problem and solve it. Finally, we demonstrate an approach for pose-mirroring in the image domain, while retaining asymmetries in foreground and background features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by generating dance videos up to 30 seconds long across approximately 25 animal instances across 10 classesincluding marmots, sea otters, hedgehogs, and catspaired with various songs. These videos represent the first-ever recorded demonstrations of these animals performing such complex musical dance routines and will be studied by generations of zoologists."

            "content": "Music-driven generative dance synthesis. Earlier learning-based approaches developed neural networks that synthesize human dance Fig. 3. System overview. Given few initially generated keyframes as input, we generate mirrored counterparts, extract choreography pattern from dance video, and optimize the keyframe structure accordingly. The final dance is synthesized by generating in-between frames with video diffusion model and warped to the musical beats. Our method is highlighted in gray. motion directly from music input [Huang et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2019, 2018; Li et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2022]. Recent advances have shifted toward diffusion-based methods [Le et al. 2023; Qi et al. 2023; Tseng et al. 2023], which also focus primarily on generating skeletal motions from music. More recently, some works have begun exploring direct dance video generation using video diffusion models [Ruan et al. 2023; Sun et al. 2020]. However, directly enforcing choreography structure within these frameworks remains challenging. In addition, these learning-based approaches typically require training dataan issue in our case, as dance videos featuring animals are extremely scarce. Graph-based human motion synthesis. In contrast to learningbased approaches, graph-based frameworks [Chen et al. 2021; Kim et al. 2006, 2003; Manfrè et al. 2016; Ofli et al. 2008] synthesize new motions from an existing dance motion segments database, and cast the dance synthesis as graph optimization problem: finding an optimal path in the constructed motion graph that aligns with the input music. For example, Kim et al. [Kim et al. 2003] introduced rhythmic and beat-based constraints to guide the path search, while more recent work ChoreoMaster [Chen et al. 2021] incorporated richer choreography rules, requiring not only structural alignment with music but also stylistic compatibility. Our approach follows this paradigm but differs in key ways. First, instead of relying on motion capture database, we take small set of keyframes of an animal or subject as input. We augment this set by generating mirrored pose images, creating complete keyframe set for dance synthesis. The graph is constructed over these keyframes, and video diffusion model is applied to generate realistic in-between frames along the optimized walk path, producing the final dance video. Second, while basic choreography rules can be inferred from the musical structure as done in [Chen et al. 2021], different performers may interpret the same piece differently. As such, we propose way to extract choreography patterns directly from reference dance video and use it as the control. Anthropomorphic character animation. Given reference image, character image animation, generates videos following target human skeletal pose sequence. While existing methods [Hu 2024; Hu et al. 2025] are primarily designed for human figures, recent work [Tan et al. 2024] extends to anthropomorphic characters by learning generalized motion representation. However, it remains favor human-like anatomy, generating animals with features like elongated limbs. They also struggle to generate high-fidelity videos from single image when handling long and diverse sequences, such as 30-second dance. In contrast, our method does not rely on per-frame human skeleton pose as guidance. Instead, we use small set of keyframes generated from text prompt as pose alternative, and synthesize intermediate frames using generative inbetweening model. Since our approach is keyframe-based and choreographically structured, it is not constrained by video length and can scale to longer dance sequences."

            "title": "3.1 Choreography Pattern Labeling",
            "content": "Choreography are closely tied to the rhythmic structure of music. In music theory, beat is the basic temporal unit, while bar (or measure) groups fixed number of beats. The meter defines how beats are grouped and emphasized within the bar, and is indicated by time signature, e.g., 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, where the upper number specifies beats per bar, and the lower number denotes the note value that receives one beat. In this work, we focus on music with 4/4 time signatureeach bar contains four quarter note beatsthe most common structure in popular music. Problem definition. Given 4/4 music track with synchronized dance video, we begin by detecting the beat times = {𝑡0, 𝑡1, ..., 𝑡𝑁 1}, 𝑁 assuming total of 𝑁 beats, corresponding to 4 bars. Based on the beat times, we construct sequence of motion segments = {𝑠0, 𝑠1, ..., 𝑠 𝑁 2 1} where each segment 𝑠𝑖 spans from beat 𝑡2𝑖 to beat 𝑡2𝑖+1. Each bar thus yields two motion segments: one from the first to the second beat, and another from the third to the fourth beat, aligning with the 4/4 music structure where major movements typically How Animals Dance (When Youre Not Looking) 3 begin on accented beats and end on weak ones, whereas transitions occur across weak-to-accented intervals. The choreo pattern labeling task outputs sequence of labels = {𝑙0, 𝑙1, ..., 𝑙 𝑁 2 1}, e.g., A-A-B-C-D-D, where each 𝑙𝑖 corresponds to motion segment 𝑠𝑖 . Distinct motions receive different labels, identical motions share the same one, and mirrored motions are indicated by prime-labeled counterparts (e.g., and A). Motion segments quantization. We formulate motion segment sequence labeling as quantization problem: clustering similar motion segments and assigning each cluster ID as its label. Each segment 𝑠𝑖 of length 𝑇𝑖 is represented by the SMPL-X [Pavlakos et al. 2019] pose sequence recovered from the video: 𝑠𝑖 = {(𝜃𝑡𝑖 𝑇𝑖 R3 ( 𝐽 +1), 𝜏𝑡𝑖 R3)} 𝑡𝑖 =0, where 𝜃𝑡𝑖 contains per-joint axis-angle rotation for 𝐽 = 21 body joints in addition to joint for global rotation (the 0-th joint), and 𝜏𝑡𝑖 denotes the global translation in 3D space. For clustering, we focus solely on posesignoring global translationsto capture distinctive motion patterns. The distance between two SMPL-X poses is defined as the average geodesic distance across joints: 𝑑𝜃 (𝜃1, 𝜃2) = 1 𝐽 𝐽 𝑗=0 log(𝑅(𝜃 𝑗 )𝑇 𝑅(𝜃 𝑗 2 ))𝐹 (1) where 𝑅(𝜃 𝑗 ) converts the axis-angle representation of joint 𝑗 into rotation matrix. To account for slight temporal offsets between beats, we compute the distance between two motion segments using dynamic time warping (DTW), with 𝑑𝜃 as the local cost metric between poses. The clustering function is then defined as: C(S; DTW𝑑𝜃 , 𝜖𝜃 ) {C1, C2, ..., C𝐶 } (2) 𝑐=1 C𝑐 = , with C𝑖 (cid:209) C𝑗 = , for 𝑖 𝑗. Segments within where (cid:208)𝐶 the same cluster satisfy: DTW𝑑𝜃 (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠 𝑗 ) < 𝜖𝜃 , 𝑠𝑖, 𝑠 𝑗 C𝑐 . Mirrored motion segments detection. After the quantization stage, we identify mirrored motion segments in two steps. Mirrored pose clusters. mirrored joint rotation is defined by reflecting the axis-angle vector across the sagittal (YZ) plane: (𝜃 𝑗 ) = (𝜔𝑥 , 𝜔𝑦, 𝜔𝑧), where 𝜃 𝑗 = (𝜔𝑥 , 𝜔𝑦, 𝜔𝑧). Then mirrored pose 𝜃 is obtained by applying this reflection to each joint after left-right joint swapping: 𝜃 𝑗 = (𝜃 𝜋 ( 𝑗 ) ) for 𝑗 = 0, . . . , 𝐽 (3) here 𝜋 ( 𝑗) denotes the left-right joint permutation (e.g. swapping left/right arms, legs, and shoulders), and for central joints (e.g., spine, neck, head), 𝜋 ( 𝑗) = 𝑗, so only the reflection is applied. Two clusters C𝑎 and C𝑏 are considered mirrored if there exists at least one pair of segments 𝑠𝑖 C𝑎, 𝑠 𝑗 C𝑏 , such that the mir𝑇𝑖 rored version of 𝑠𝑖 , denoted by 𝑠 𝑖 = {𝜃 𝑡𝑖 =0, is similar to 𝑠 𝑗 un𝑡𝑖 } der dynamic time warping: DTW𝑑𝜃 (𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑗 ) < 𝜖𝜃 . The resulting set of mirrored cluster pairs is: = {(C𝑎, C𝑏 ) 𝑠𝑖 C𝑎, 𝑠 𝑗 C𝑏, DTW𝑑𝜃 (𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑠 𝑗 ) < 𝜖𝜃 }. Mirrored motion directions within cluster. For clusters without mirrored counterpart, we further check whether they can be internally partitioned into two directionally mirrored groups. We first extract the overall motion direction (cid:174)𝑑𝑠𝑖 of each motion segment Xiaojuan Wang, Aleksander Holynski, Brian Curless, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, and Steven M. Seitz 𝑡𝑖 𝜏 0 𝑡𝑖 𝜏 0 𝑡𝑖 )/𝜏𝑇𝑖 𝑠𝑖 using its global translation: (cid:174)𝑑𝑠𝑖 = (𝜏𝑇𝑖 𝑡𝑖 , where 𝑡𝑖 and 𝜏𝑇𝑖 𝜏 0 𝑡𝑖 denote the segments start and end positions, respectively. To identify mirrored directions, each motion direction (cid:174)𝑑𝑠𝑖 is reflected across the YZ plane as (cid:174)𝑑 𝑠𝑖 = diag([1, 1, 1]) (cid:174)𝑑𝑠𝑖 . We then perform bipartite matching to find mirror pairs (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠 𝑗 ) that satisfy (cid:174)𝑑 𝑠𝑖 (cid:174)𝑑𝑠 𝑗 < 𝜖𝑑 . If valid pairs are found, we assign all matched segments into two directionally consistent groups based on their directional similarity. The original cluster C𝑖 is then partitioned 𝑖 , C1 into two mirrored subgroups (C0 𝑖 ), which are then added to the mirrored cluster set M. Finally, we assign unique label to each cluster. For each mirrored pair (C𝑎, C𝑏 ) M, we assign base label 𝑙𝑎 (e.g. A) to segments in C𝑎, and its mirrored label 𝑙 𝑎 (e.g. A) to segments in C𝑏 . Clusters without mirrored counterpart are assigned distinct label without prime."

To ensure both expressive motion and synthesis feasibility, we filter nodes based on the average per-pixel flow magnitude 𝐹 (𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣), computed over the foreground region of the subject. Nodes with flow that is too small (insufficient motion) or too large (challenging for video synthesis) are discarded, as shown in Fig. 6 . Only node pairs with acceptable motion range are retained: 𝑉 = (cid:8)(𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣) 𝑀low < 𝐹 (𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣) < 𝑀high (cid:9) (4) To make the synthesized dance smooth and fluid, we define the edge cost between two nodes as the flow magnitude between the end keyframe of the first node and start one of the next node: ((𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣) (𝐼𝑤, 𝐼𝑥 )) = 𝐹 (𝐼𝑣, 𝐼𝑤).

This template may come from previously generated grid (see Fig. 8 for an example) or be extracted from human dance video by identifying distinct poses. This provides way to guide or customize the input poses, which allows to generate dance videos where different animals dance alike (see supplementary video for examples). Motion range control. The threshold parameters 𝑀low and 𝑀high control the range of allowed motion magnitudes between keyframes. typical setting is 𝑀low 12. and 𝑀high 60.. Within this range, lowering 𝑀low and increasing 𝑀high introduces more candidate nodes and transitions, potentially resulting in richer and more expressive dances. User custom constraints control. During graph optimization, users can specify hard constraints on node assignmentsfor instance, enforcing preferred keyframe pair(s) for specific label(s). Additionally, for some dance, mirrored poses happen at the start and end of choreography label. When such mirrored pose pairs are detected for specific label, we can enforce corresponding node assignments during optimization. For example, such labels have to be assigned to nodes (𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣) where 𝐼𝑣 = 𝐼 𝑢 , This allows closer alignment with the reference choreography."

For example, in Fig. 10, the average flow magnitude from the left one to the right one is 𝐹 (𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣) = 36.81, which appears moderate due to incorrect correspondences between opposite sides. In reality, this motion is difficult for the video model to synthesize. Fig. 10. Failures. While average flow magnitude from the left one to the right one 𝐹 (𝐼𝑢, 𝐼𝑣 ) = 36.81 is not large, the motion is hard to synthesize for video model."

            "content": "Another potential relevant line of work for generating animal dance videos is character animation, which animates an input image using pose sequence, typically extracted from human motion videos. However, transferring human poses to animals remains an open challenge due to the need to solve complex correspondence problems across different body morphologies and modalities, let alone dealing with long and diverse pose sequences as in dance. As an example, we experimented with generating such videos using Animate-X [Tan et al. 2024]: we extract pose sequences from real dance video and use GPT-4o to generate an input image of marmot that mimics the human pose from the first frame, providing better start point for animation. As shown in Figure 11, the results looks blurry and the animated marmot taking on human-like body shapes. Fig. 11. Example results using character animation method.

            "content": "We use an offline video diffusion model to generate short motion segments between keyframes, for example, 0.5s for 120 BPM song. While the results are often visually coherent, , the motion can sometimes appear unrealistic; animals may appear to slide or morph between poses rather than moving in physically plausible way. This reflects the current limitations of video diffusion models in producing naturalistic motion for articulated subjects. However, with continued advances in large-scale video diffusion models, we are optimistic that these issues can be addressed in the future."
