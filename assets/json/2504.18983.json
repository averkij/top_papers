            "content": "Data augmentation (DA) expands limited datasets with synthetic variations that preserve labels such as flips, rotations and elastic deformations, and it has become indispensable for deep learning [73]. In medical image analysis where scans annotated by experts are scarce, class distributions are skewed and diagnostic cues are subtle, DA directly translates into more reliable screening, triage and treatment planning systems. Two significant challenges remain. First, there is pronounced domain gap between natural photographs, which motivated most modern DA methods, and medical images whose low contrast, high noise and 2 Xuyin Qi, Zeyu Zhang, and Canxuan Gang et al. dense semantic content can make policies designed for ImageNet distort or remove critical disease features, leaving these methods underexplored in clinical AI [60]. Second, DA studies that focus on medical imaging are often fragmented and limited to single task or model, so it remains unclear which advanced strategies based on mixing images truly improve performance and why [44]. To address these challenges, we investigate whether the state of the art mix based DA policies, originally developed for natural images, can boost medical classifiers. We introduce MediAug, unified pipeline that applies six prominent techniques, including MixUp [99], YOCO [34], CropMix [35], CutMix [97], AugMix [38] and SnapMix [42], to two clinically relevant datasets, namely the brain tumour MRI dataset [7] and the eye disease fundus dataset [24]. We evaluate both ResNet-50 [37] and ViT-B [25] backbones by conducting comprehensive experiments that reveal how augmentation and architecture choices affect performance. We introduce MediAug, comprehensive and reproducible study of advanced DA strategies for medical imaging that offers unified reference and practical guidance for the research community. Our study provides systematic evaluation of MixUp, CutMix, SnapMix, AugMix, CropMix and YOCO across convolutional and transformer backbones, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on the brain tumour and eye disease datasets, achieving 79.19% with MixUp on ResNet-50 and 99.44% with SnapMix on ViT-B for brain tumour classification and 91.60% with YOCO on ResNet-50 and 97.94% with CutMix on ViT-B for eye disease classification, indicating that MixUp on ResNet-50 and SnapMix on ViT-B are optimal for brain tumours and YOCO on ResNet-50 and CutMix on ViT-B are optimal for eye diseases."

In medical imaging, DA enhances image classification [58,68,91,103], object detection [107,105,9,10,108], and semantic segmentation [113,101,80,27,81,104,90,106] performance, where expert annotated scans are scarce and manual labeling costs are high, these techniques reduce reliance on large annotated datasets [57], improve the accuracy of automated screening and triage systems [78], support semi supervised and transfer learning workflows [14] when annotations are limited, assist clinicians by lowering diagnostic costs [26,102], accelerate clinical throughput [70,39], and enable more consistent segmentation of lesions and organs in complex modalities such as MRI and CT [57,67].

These strategies have demonstrated significant performance gains on natural image benchmarks and offer promising directions for robust medical image analysis."

The goal of YOCO is to apply data augmentation in way that enhances both local and global diversity while maintaining the structural integrity of the image. data augmentation function a() : RCHW RCHW transforms the input image into an augmented image = a(X). Unlike traditional augmentation methods, YOCO first splits the input image into sub-regions. To achieve this, the image is randomly split into two parts along either the height or width dimension. Specifically, if the random variable (0, 1) (a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1) satisfies 0 < 0.5, the image is split along the height, resulting in two sub-images [X1, X2] = cutH(X). Alternatively, if 0.5 < 1, the image is split along the width, resulting in [X1, X2] = cutW(X). The dimensions of these sub-images depend on the splitting direction: - For height splitting, X1, X2 RC 2 , - For width splitting, X1, X2 RCH 2 . After splitting, independent augmentation functions a1() and a2() are applied to the two sub-images X1 and X2, respectively. These augmentations may involve operations such as rotation, flipping, or intensity adjustment. The final augmented image is then reconstructed by concatenating the two augmented sub-images along the original splitting axis: = concat[a1(X1), a2(X2)]. To generalize this approach for more complex scenarios, YOCO can split the image into + 1 parts along the height and + 1 parts along the width, producing (M + 1) (N + 1) sub-images. This is represented as: [Xi,j] = cutM,N (X), = 1, . . . , + 1, = 1, . . . , + 1, where Xi,j denotes the sub-image located in the i-th row and j-th column of the grid. Each sub-image Xi,j is independently augmented using corresponding augmentation function ai,j(). The final augmented image is then reconstructed by concatenating all augmented sub-images: = concatM +1,N +1 i=1,j=1 [ai,j(Xi,j)]. By augmenting sub-regions while preserving global structure, YOCO boosts data diversity, aiding detection of localized features in medical imaging and improving model robustness."

Let represent the original input medical image, and Ii denote cropped view of I, obtained through random resized cropping (RRC) with crop scale si, where si [smin, smax]. The cropped views Ii are generated to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained information from the image. To combine these views, mixing coefficient Î» is sampled from Beta distribution, denoted as Î» Beta(Î±, Î±), where Î± > 0 controls the interpolation strength. The mixed image is computed using the following formula: = Î»I1 + (1 Î»)I2, where I1 and I2 are two randomly selected cropped views of I, and Î» determines the mixing ratio. Since all cropped views are derived from the same image, the label of the original image remains unchanged, ensuring semantic consistency: = y. In medical imaging applications, CropMix, as illustrated in panels (d) of figs. 2 and 3, leverages the multi-scale information captured from the cropped views to enhance the models ability to learn localized lesion features while retaining global anatomical structures. For example, in lesion classification tasks, the combination of fine-grained and coarse-grained information helps the model focus on both detailed lesion characteristics and broader contextual cues. By interpolating cropped views and preserving labels, CropMix effectively reduces sensitivity to label noise, alleviates overfitting, and improves robustness, making it highly valuable for medical image analysis. 8 Xuyin Qi, Zeyu Zhang, and Canxuan Gang et al.

To create mixed image I, SnapMix combines cropped regions Ra and Rb from two input images Ia and Ib: = Ra + Rb. The mixed label for is computed by weighting the original labels ya and yb of Ia and Ib according to their semantic ratios SRa and SRb: = SRa SRa + SRb ya + SRb SRa + SRb yb. This ensures that the mixed label accurately reflects the semantic contributions of Ra and Rb to the mixed image I. 12 Xuyin Qi, Zeyu Zhang, and Canxuan Gang et al. Fig. 10: ROC curves with ViT-B on eye diseases dataset [24]. Fig. 11: ROC curves with ResNet-50 on eye diseases dataset [24]. In medical imaging, SnapMix, as illustrated in panels (g) of figs. 2 and 3, is particularly effective for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as lesion segmentation and disease classification. By using CAMs to guide the mixing process, SnapMix ensures that the mixed images retain meaningful semantic information. The semantic ratio SRi captures the importance of specific regions, allowing the method to focus on areas of high diagnostic relevance. This approach mitigates overfitting, enhances model robustness to data variability, and improves generalization to unseen cases, making SnapMix valuable tool in medical image analysis."

These results underscore the importance of systematic hyperparameter sweeps for mix-based augmentations but as demonstrated in Section 4.3 they only reflect CutMixs internal parameter tuning and do not alter the overall optimal strategies, where MixUp on ResNet-50 and SnapMix on ViT-B remain best for brain tumour classification and YOCO on ResNet-50 and CutMix on ViT-B remain best for eye disease classification. Moreover, this concrete example of CutMix tuning illustrates general approach: the same protocol can and should be applied to fine-tune MixUps interpolation weight, SnapMixs semantic mixing ratios and YOCOs region split configurations, demonstrating that hyperparameter optimization holds practical significance across all mix-based augmentation methods."

While horizontal flipping is widely used to enhance model robustness to spatial variations, vertical flipping is less common due to the potential semantic inconsistencies between the top and bottom regions of an image. Fig. 1: Flippingis data augmentation technique that generates mirror image by inverting pixel positions across specified axis, typically horizontally, to expand training datasets and improve model generalization. 2 Xuyin Qi, Zeyu Zhang, and Canxuan Gang et al. 1-1-b.Rotation [29] is data augmentation technique that transforms an image by rotating it around fixed axis within specified range of angles, thereby enhancing model robustness to orientation variations, as shown in fig. 2. While this method is generally effective for tasks like medical imaging, its applicability depends on the rotation degree, as excessive rotation may alter label semantics in certain contexts, such as digit recognition. Fig. 2: Rotation based image augmentation transforms the original image by pivoting it around its centre across an axis within 1-359 degrees while preserving pixel relationships. MediAug: Exploring Visual Augmentation in Medical Imaging 3 1-1-c.
