            "content": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are trained to represent vision and language in shared space. But does this joint representation enable consistent reasoning across modalities? We introduce REST and REST+ (RenderEquivalence Stress Tests), two benchmarks for systematically evaluating cross-modal consistency. Each sample presents semantically identical information in three forms (image, text, and mixed), allowing us to measure whether models produce consistent outputs regardless of modality. Evaluating 15 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we find that none reason consistently across modalities, with substantial variation in the degree of inconsistency. Neither rendering text as images nor images as text resolves this problem, even when controlling for OCR errors. We further show that visual characteristics (color, resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens affect performance even when text is correctly recognized. Finally, our consistency score correlates with the cross-modal cosine similarity in embedding space, suggesting mechanistic explanation: inconsistent reasoning arises when text and image representations occupy distinct regions of the joint space 1. Introduction Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [3, 4, 11, 21, 22, 43], have achieved remarkable progress across diverse multimodal tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities in visual question answering [23, 44, 45], document understanding [25, 26], and complex reasoning [4, 21, 31]. The success of MLLMs suggests they have learned to integrate visual and textual information for multimodal understanding seamlessly, even though these modalities might not explicitly be integrated. In particular, recent work points out the existence of modality gap in different MLLMs, where text and image embeddings occupy different regions in the joint embedding space [20, 30, 34]. The smaller this gap, the better the downstream task performance [13, 34]. 1Shared first author. {a.v.vansprang,l.samson}@uva.nl the idea of Simultaneously, recent work by the authors of rendering DeepSeek-OCR [40] explores text as images to reduce token costs. They demonstrate that compressing 10 text tokens into single visual token maintains 97% optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy, offering substantial computational savings for text-heavy inputs. However, this raises fundamental question given the modality gap: when model successfully reads text from an image, does it reason about information as effectively as when receiving native text? If not, this could pose critical problems: MLLMs might perform better on the text modality, as their foundation is an LLM. They might produce incorrect answers based solely on the prompt modality, rather than on the information it contains. We refer to this as cross-modal inconsistency: obtaining inconsistent results on prompts with semantically identical (same content) information in different modalities. that Existing work has documented cross-modal inconsistencies in MLLMs [5, 32, 33, 35, 45], but prior benchmarks either evaluate only single model [46] or do not control for actual readability (OCR, [8]), potentially conflating text recognition failures with reasoning inconsistencies. To address this gap, we introduce REST (RenderEquivalence Stress Tests) and REST+ to systematically evaluate cross-modal reasoning consistency under controlled OCR difficulty. Both benchmarks present the same semantic content in three formats: text-only, image-only, and mixed (question in text, context in image). REST measures performance on SOEBENCH, our newly generated system-of-equations task with easy-to-recognise symbols, and on three established benchmarks where text is rendered as an image (MMLU [16], ARC [9], GSM-Symbolic [27]). SOEBENCH ensures minimal OCR burden and guarantees zero prior exposure, reducing potential memorisation issues by MLLMs. All analyses are performed conditional on the model producing correct OCR for the given question. REST+ extends REST by permuting each image in 10 different ways, varying the font, resolution, and text color. This allows us to evaluate the consistency of reasoning skills across formats, including the amount of visual tokens. Our research questions are: Figure 1. Summary of our work. Left: Our REST benchmark measures whether MLLMs can consistently reason over identical information across modalities. We first verify text recognition (OCR) capability, then evaluate the same question in three modalities (text, image, mixed). Cross-modal inconsistency occurs when models produce different answers depending on the input format. Center: RER consistency score measures the degree to which model outputs the same answer in all modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs (on OCR correct, sorted on REST) and find that the degree of cross-modal inconsistency varies substantially across models even when controlling for OCR. Right: Matching samples (i.e., different modalities containing the same information) show higher cosine similarity than non-matching ones, and the extent of this difference correlates with the consistency score on our benchmark. RQ1: Do current frontier MLLMs exhibit cross-modal inconsistency? If so, which modalities perform best? RQ2: Is cross-modal inconsistency due to OCR performance rather than true modality differences? RQ3: Do visual characteristics such as resolution (RQ3a) or font and text colour (RQ3b) influence cross-modal inconsistency, and if so, how? RQ4: Given the internal representations of the same concept in different modalities, is there correlation between the cross-modal similarity of internal representations and the degree of cross-modal inconsistency? We have three main contributions. First, we introduce REST and REST+ as benchmarks to measure cross-modal inconsistency. Unlike previous benchmarks, we include new set of tasks (SOEBENCH) that is guaranteed to not be seen during pre-training and control for OCR complexity. Next, we evaluate 15 frontier MLLMs and find substantial inconsistencies across modalities (at least 10% inconsistency), even when controlling for OCR. This leaves notable gap of solvable questions that current models fail to capture. Finally, we analyse the internal representations of matching samples (i.e., samples with the same information in different modalities) and find that they show higher cosine similarity than non-matching pairs, and that this similarity magnitude correlates with our consistency score. We will release all code and data upon publication. 2. Our Benchmarks: REST and REST+ We introduce our REST and REST+ benchmarks to enable the systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in MLLMs. We investigate whether models consistently reason over identical information presented across different modalities, while controlling for potential confounding effects from OCR performance. 2.1. REST Our benchmark consists of four distinct evaluation tasks: OCR: Extract rendered text from the image. Text: Answer textual questions. Image: Answer questions rendered as images. Mixed: Answer questions with the context as image and the question as text (or, in case of multiple-choice questions, the question is the image and the options are text). Our benchmark consists of our SOEBENCH task and three established benchmarks: MMLU [15], ARC [10], and GSM-Symbolic [27]. To isolate cross-modal consistency from OCR failures, we minimise OCR complexity (i.e. we prevent models from failing to understand the images) by excluding questions with more than 800 characters (threshold decided by initial experiments) and questions with LaTeX code (for which OCR is ambiguous). To keep the text easy to read, we render images with white backgrounds and high-resolution (DPI 200) black DejaVu Sans text. 2.2. REST+ We introduce REST+ to study the effect of visual characteristics (such as resolution, font and colour) on cross-modal inconsistency. REST+ increases complexity by creating 10 visual permutations of each image while preserving semantic content. For computational feasibility, we only include the text and image tasks. We use MMLU [15] with the same question filtering as in REST. We create 10 permutations for each question: 9 combinations from 3 font families (DejaVu Sans, Courier New, Cursive), 3 DPI values (50, 100, 200), and one coloured variant (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, or yellow) at 200 DPI using DejaVu Sans. We manually verified that the text is legible at 50 DPI for each font. We randomly sample 10% per subject class for computational feasibility, which results in 1085 final questions. Sample images are provided in the Appendix. 2.3. SOEBENCH SOEBENCH is task suite based on solving systems of linear equations presented in text, image, or mixed modalities included in REST and REST+. Each question contains symbolic variables and requires basic algebraic reasoning, with all instances generated to have single integer solution. Its restricted symbol set (digits 09 and letters AE) reduces OCR complexity, ensuring that performance differences reflect reasoning rather than recognition errors. Since it is newly generated, we can guarantee existing MLLMs have had no prior exposure to it. 3. Benchmarking Methodology For each REST question, the MLLM receives four input prompts. First, we verify OCR performance by letting the model transcribe the image, ensuring that the model can read the question. For the remaining tasks (text, mixed, image), we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. All prompts are shown in the Appendix. We limit the output to 1024 tokens for all tasks, except for SOEBENCH, for which we allow 2048 output tokens because 1024 is not always sufficient. We set the temperature to 0 for reproducibility. We parse answers using regular expressions and treat format-invalid responses as incorrect. We introduce three metrics to evaluate our benchmark on cross-modal inconsistency. We measure answer consistency across modalities with the Render-Equivalence Rate (RER), which is similar to the consistency score from Zhang et al. [46]: RER = {x (xt) = (xi, zi) = (xm, zm)} , (1) where denotes text prompts and denotes images for input type (text, image or mixed), is the model, and is the dataset size. This metric represents the fraction of questions for which the model gives the same answer for all modalities, where 1 denotes perfectly consistent model. We also evaluate inconsistency in questions solvable only through specific modalities, i.e., those answerable in at least one, but not all, modalities. We use the Cross-Modality Failure Rate (CFR): CFR = {q 1 (cid:80) mM C(q, m) < } Nc , (2) where Nc is the number of questions that are answered correctly in at least one modality, = {text, image, mixed}, and C(q, m) indicates correctness (1 correct, 0 incorrect) for question and modality m. We exclude questions that failed for all modalities since these represent inability rather than inconsistency. score of 0 indicates perfectly consistent model."

To evaluate OCR performance, we use Character Error Rate (CER), which measures character insertions, deletions, and substitutions and normalises by reference length. For the evaluation of cross-modality consistency, we include only the questions where text is perfectly recognised. We only evaluate letters and digits to focus on semantic recognition rather than punctuation. 4. Benchmarking Results: REST 4.1. RQ1: Cross-modal inconsistency in MLLMs Table 1 presents RER and CFR scores for 15 state-of-theart MLLMs, with separate scores for all data and only those questions with correct OCR (OCR). The scores are averaged over all four REST benchmarks. The RER consistency scores vary substantially across MLLMs, ranging from 6.6% to 90.7%. Notably, RER scores are equal or slightly higher for all models when only evaluating questions with correct OCR. This indicates that OCR errors do affect consistency, and our efforts to control OCR complexity are justified. Moreover, the model rankings are not affected by excluding incorrect OCR questions. Overall, closed-source models (GPT-5-mini [29] and Claude Haiku 4.5 [6]) achieve the highest consistency scores (90.7% and 90.3%, respectively, when OCR is correct). Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite [37] and GPT-4o-mini [37] perform worse than other closed-source models. Among open-source models, Qwen-2.5 32B [7] leads with an RER of 84.7%. Table 1. REST scores for 15 MLLMs show varying degrees of cross-modal inconsistency. RER and CFR scores are given for all questions and for those where models correctly recognised the rendered text (OCR). All models achieve equal or higher RER scores on the OCRsubset, though differences are minor. Table 2. Preference for Text. This table presents accuracies for the text, mixed, and image tasks on MMLU, AI2-ARC, and GSM8k-Symbolic (OCR-correct subset).

This inconsistency even reaches 82.3% for Phi-4 [2], which means that obtaining correct answer depends on how the input is formatted (text, mixed, or image). Max modal coverage Given the presence of cross-modal inconsistency in MLLMs, we examine which modalities obtain more correct answers. Figure 2 shows models with low, medium, and high consistency scores for GSM8kSymbolic [27]. We report scores on this dataset because it contains open-ended questions that cannot be solved by guessing. The results show that models with low consistency could increase model performance drastically when In particular, solving questions in the optimal modality. MMC (i.e., fraction of questions that are solvable through at least one modality) for Phi-4 is 85.9%, but only 36.7% of questions can be solved in all modalities. So, 49.2% of questions might obtain incorrect answers if they are not in the optimal modality. Similarly, DeepSeek-VL-Small [41] can only solve 10.2% of the questions through text alone. Qwen2.5-VL-32B shows the best consistency, where almost all questions can be solved in all modalities.

Several model families (Phi, Gemma, ChatGPT, and Claude) consistently achieve their best performance in text rather than other modalities (e.g., GPT-4o-mini obtains more than 7% higher accuracy in text than in mixed or image on MMLU). This raises the question of whether we observe data contamination, where the questions of these text benchmarks were included in the models training data, or whether the text modality is inherently more effective in MLLMs. 4.2. RQ2: Controlling for OCR Therefore, we evaluate cross-modal inconsistency on data that all models have not seen before, while keeping OCR simple, by using our SOEBENCH. Table 3 shows the consistency scores, task accuracies and OCR accuracies on this benchmark. Firstly, all models can solve OCR (near) perfectly, with the exception of DeepSeek-Tiny, which reproduces the example answer from the input prompt. Moreover, the Gemma and GPT models still outperform on the text modality. Surprisingly, Phi-4 now performs better on the image modality, while the other benchmarks showed higher performance on the text modality by large margin. We argue that OCR and data contamination are not the main reasons for cross-modal inconsistency, as models inherently perform better through the text modality. Preference for text modality Using the different tasks in REST, we find that almost all models perform better in the text modality (see Table 2 for the accuracies on MMLU, AI2-ARC and GSM8k-Symbolic). With statistical t-test, and combining the answers from all benchmarks, we find OCR first, then solve Chen et al. [8] demonstrate improved results when instructing MLLMs to first extract information from an image before solving the task. Table 4 reports the accuracy difference between direct image proFigure 2. Cross-modal inconsistency leaves model potential untapped. This figure shows the cumulative distribution of correctly solved questions across sets of modalities (OCR-correct subset). From left to right, the bars represent: the percentage of questions that can be solved in all three modalities, followed by including questions that can only be solved in fewer modalities, ending with the Max Modal Coverage (green), which shows the percentage of questions that can be solved in at least one modality. Results are shown for GSM8kSymbolic, which contains open-ended questions that cannot be solved by guessing. Table 3. Models inherently perform better through the text modality. These results on our SOEBENCH include consistency scores, accuracies for the different tasks and OCR accuracy (OCRcorrect subset). Even when the data is novel and models achieve (nearly) perfect OCR scores, the text modality is still preferred. Table 4. OCR first, then solve strategy can hurt performance. We show the difference in accuracy () when MLLMs are instructed to first transcribe text from images before solving the task (OCR-correct subset). This does not yield consistent improvements across models and benchmarks. Full table in Appendix.

First, OCR performance is worse than for REST, as expected, because of the lower image resolutions. Second, the overall RER and CFR scores are lower for REST+ than the basic version. The high CFR values (best: 30.2%) indicate that the input format matters: different font, colour, or resolution can determine whether an answer is correct or incorrect. Finally, the model rankings differ from the OCR correct and the full set of questions. In particular, one model (InternVL3-14B) achieves the highest consistency scores on both, but others (Claude Haiku and Mistral) decrease significantly when considering the full set of questions. 5.

Therefore, we conclude that OCR capabilities should be considered when evaluating cross-modal inconsistency (e.g., Claude Haiku would have shown worse performance if we had not controlled for incorrect OCR). Comparing efficiency of text and vision tokens Different image resolutions result in different numbers of visual tokens for many models. Wei et al. [40] have developed DeepSeek-OCR to maintain performance when compressing text into fewer visual tokens. We investigate whether current MLLMs could already obtain similar efficiency gains (where we use efficiency to describe obtaining similar or better performance with fewer tokens). Figure 3. Models generally achieve higher text accuracy despite using fewer text tokens. Current MLLMs need more vision tokens than text tokens to achieve the same accuracy, except for Qwen2.5-VL-32B, where fewer vision tokens obtain higher accuracy (OCR-correct subset). Figure 3 shows text and image accuracy for three models at different DPI levels (50, 100, 200). Qwen2.5-32B demonstrates higher efficiency for vision, where less image tokens achieve 1.8% higher accuracy than text tokens (104 image tokens on average (σ = 24) at 50 DPI, vs. 142 text tokens). In contrast, Qwen2.5-7B shows less visual token efficiency at DPI@50, where text and vision accuracies differ significantly despite comparable token counts. In fact, only Qwen-32B exhibits the property of being more efficient with vision tokens while scoring better than with text tokens, all other models (see Appendix) either perform better with text or are more efficient with text. Note that Inimage token counts exclude text instruction tokens. terestingly, InternVL3-14B (the most consistent model on REST+) uses approximately 1600 visual tokens (regardless of DPI), while requiring only 160 text tokens on average, 10:1 ratio. Although InternVL3 shows higher image accuracy than text accuracy, text tokens are more efficient. Since we lack exact token usage data for closed-source models, we cannot perform the same analysis. Nevertheless, Claude, the GPTs, and Gemini all obtain better performance for text than image accuracy at DPI@50. DeepSeek-OCR presents an interesting direction for future research in making MLLMs more efficient. However, we observe that current models reason substantially better through the text modality and that fewer text tokens than vision tokens are needed to obtain the same performance (except for Qwen2.5-VL-32B). In other words, although models can correctly read text from images, they do not necessarily reason as well as they would with conventional text input. goldfish (a) Image (b) Written-down (c) Text Figure 5.

We compute this similarity score at each layer of each model Figure 4. Colored text makes models perform better. Relative improvements from either red or yellow text compared to black (OCR-correct subset). 5.2. RQ3b: Impact of font, colour on inconsistency Surprisingly, font families show no clear differences in image accuracy, despite our initial expectations that cursive fonts would be harder to read. Most models stay within 2% absolute difference between fonts (only Phi-3.5 shows 5.3% difference between DejaVu Sans and Courier New). Unexpectedly, most models perform better with coloured text than black text (Figure 4, DPI@200). Most MLLMs achieve higher accuracies with red or yellow fonts. Multiple models even obtain more than 5% relative improvement (e.g. DeepSeek-Small and Qwen-32B). We show more detailed results in the Appendix. 6. RQ4: Multimodal Representation Analysis To answer RQ4, we aim to find the internal mechanisms that determine models inconsistency. We postulate that models with higher similarities between their modalities score better on our benchmark. We calculate the implicit alignment score introduced by Shukor and Cord [34]. They define alignment in terms of cosine similarity: the higher the similarity score, the more the representations point in the same direction. They find that this score is proxy metric for task performance on several multimodal benchmarks. We use Imagenet [12], containing natural images and text labels. We expand the data by generating images containing written-down labels (see Figure 5). This simulates our REST benchmark which contains text-only, image-only and mixed data. We perform the experiments on 1,000 samples. Note that we exclude our REST benchmark, because our aim is to assess the correlation between our benchmark and the modality gap (RQ4). To this end, we analyse realFigure 6. Benchmark performance is correlated to the similarity of modalities. The similarity between image vs. word (a) and writtendown vs. word (b) representations correlates with RER (as determined using our REST benchmark). R2 denotes the variance explained by the fitted line, and the grey area shows the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval. and report the maximum score across all layers. We repeat this process bidirectionally (image-to-text and textto-image retrieval), yielding multiple similarity scores per model that characterize the cross-modal alignment from different perspectives. Figure 6 shows that similarity scores are correlated with the Render-Equivalence Rate (RER), especially for the similarity between images and words and between written-down labels and words. This indicates that matching questions are very similar to each other in consistent models (i.e. models with high RER). Note that the similarity scores between written-down labels and words are higher overall, indicating that written-down representations are more similar to matching word representations than image representations are. 7. Related Work Most MLLM benchmarks are visual question-answering tasks [14, 17, 23, 24, 36, 44] and do not include data samples where the same question is presented across different modalities. The Omni-R benchmark [8] does contain paired questions in text, image, video, and audio, based on MMLU-Pro [39]. However, it evaluates inconsistency only in closed-source MLLMs and does not control for OCR effects. MMMU-Pro [45] contains vision-only subtask in which the text is rendered alongside the original visuals. Our work differs in making the OCR task as simple as possible, whereas MMMU-Pro renders text in screenshots or natural photos. The vision-language consistency dataset of Zhang et al. [46] includes multiple existing text benchmarks, but evaluates only GPT-4V [3] and similarly does not control for OCR. MMIR [42] focuses on different form of multimodal inconsistency: detecting semantic mismatches between text and vision. Alonso et al. [5] show that MLLMs are unable to consistently match the same entity across modalities, which contain complementary information, and not identical (like ours). Similarly, Samson et al. [32] find cases where MLLMs handle the concept of privacy differently in text and vision, and Sim et al. [35] study modality collapse (ignoring certain modalities) and find that the text modality often dominates. Current literature agrees on the existence of modality gap in different MLLMs, where text and image embeddings occupy different regions in the joint embedding space [20, 30, 33, 34]. Liang et al. show the modality gap for the first time for CLIP, which they attribute to the two modalities initialising narrow embedding cone, which is preserved by the loss function [20]. This phenomenon has since been documented more broadly across MLLMs [34]. Shukor and Cord actually find positive correlation between the cosine similarity of the text and image representations within one prompt and task performance [34]. Eslami and de Melo find that mitigating this gap in CLIP (by parameter sharing) improves the performance on downstream tasks [13]. 8. Discussion and Conclusion In this work, we present the REST and REST+ benchmarks to evaluate cross-modal inconsistency in MLLMs. Through our experiments, we find that there is considerable crossmodal inconsistency in state-of-the-art MLLMs, which answers RQ1. This varies across models, with cross-modal inconsistency scores ranging from 10% to 90%, depending on the MLLM. We find that GPT-5-mini [29] and Claude Haiku 4.5 [6] achieve the highest consistency scores and that almost all MLLMs perform best in the text modality. Despite only evaluating on questions with correct OCR, we find that the cross-modal inconsistency persists. This indicates that cross-modal inconsistency is not simply byproduct of poor OCR performance, which answers RQ2. We find that neither rendering images as text (OCR first) nor rendering text as images solves the inconsistency. We find that font resolution has an effect on cross-modal inconsistency, where higher DPI correlates with more consistent MLLM performance across modalities, even when controlling for OCR performance. This answers RQ3a. In other words, although models can correctly read text from images, they do not necessarily reason as well as they would with conventional text input. We show that font does not have clear impact on cross-modal inconsistency, while text colour does (RQ3b). In our multimodal representation analysis experiment, we examine the internal representations of the same concept in different modalities. We observe positive correlation between the cross-modal similarity of internal representations and our RER consistency score. This implies that the direction of representations from matching samples is linked to modality inconsistency, which answers RQ4. Future work could study whether this effect is causal, in particular by optimising the representations to be more similar and observing whether the RER consistency score increases."

            "content": "9. Benchmark Implementation Details We provide complete specifications for reproducing the REST benchmark experiments, including prompt templates and dataset examples. All code, data, and model outputs will be released publicly upon acceptance to facilitate future research on cross-modal consistency. 9.1. REST Images In Figure 7, we show examples of both mixed and image modalities for randomly selected questions from MMLU, ARC, and GSM8K-Symbolic. Samples for SOEBENCH are provided in the following section. We render all images at DPI 200 on white background using black DejaVu Sans font to maximise readability and ensure consistent OCR performance. To minimise OCR complexity, we exclude questions exceeding 800 characters and those containing LaTeX formatting, as mathematical notation can introduce ambiguity in text recognition tasks. The mixed modality format depends on the benchmark structure: for multiple-choice questions (MMLU, ARC), the answer options appear as text while the question context is rendered as an image; for open-ended tasks (GSM8KSymbolic, SOEBENCH), the problem context appears as an image while the final question is presented as text. Prompts Figure 8 presents the prompt templates for the four core tasks in the REST benchmark. We encourage Chain-of-Thought reasoning across all modalities and maintain consistent instructions, only adjusting for how model should solve question. For the OCR task, we explicitly instruct models to perform only text transcription without solving the problem, as some models would otherwise attempt to provide answers alongside the transcription. 9.2. REST+ For the more challenging benchmark, we create 10 image permutations per question (Figure 9). We generate 9 combinations using three font families (DejaVu Sans, Courier New, and Cursive) and three resolutions (50, 100, and 200 DPI). We specifically chose these distinct font types to evaluate how cross-modal consistency varies across different typographic styles. Additionally, we create one color variant using DejaVu Sans at 200 DPI, with colors assigned cyclically using modulo operation from set of six standard colors (red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow). We manually verified that text remains legible at 50 DPI for all font families to ensure that performance differences reflect reasoning capabilities rather than readability issues. We limit our evaluation to these 10 permutations for computational feasibility, as each question requires 21 forward passes (1 text, 10 OCR verification, and 10 imagebased solving). Questions are sampled from MMLU at 10% per subject area to maintain subject balance across the reduced dataset. With 1,085 questions and 21 forward passes per question, we perform 22,785 evaluations per MLLM. We exclude the mixed modality from REST+ as it would require 10 additional forward passes per question, substantially increasing computational costs. For the prompts, we use the same templates as in REST depicted in Figure 8, maintaining consistency in evaluation instructions across both benchmarks. 9.3. SOEBENCH To ensure zero data contamination and minimise OCR complexity, we introduced SOEBENCH, novel system-ofequations benchmark specifically designed for evaluating cross-modal consistency. Each puzzle presents letter variables (A through for {3, 4, 5}) that must be solved to find integer values between 1 and 9. The benchmark consists of 150 puzzles total, with 50 puzzles for each value of n. Each puzzle contains clue equations plus one final equation to solve. Variables appear with coefficients ranging from 1 to 3, combined using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *). For example, clue equation might read 2A + = 15 while the final equation presents 3B - + 2C = ? where the model must determine the result. We ensure each puzzle has unique solution by verifying that only one assignment of values satisfies all clue equations simultaneously. For the mixed modality, we render the clue equations as an image while presenting the final equation as text. For the image modality, all equations, including the final question, are rendered together. We use DejaVu Sans font at 200 DPI on white background with black text to maximise readability. The restricted symbol set (digits 0-9, letters A-E, and basic operators) ensures that OCR performance remains near-perfect for most models, allowing us to isolate reasoning capabilities from recognition challenges. Figure 10 shows example puzzles with varying numbers of variables. Prompts Figure 11 presents the prompt templates. While the text, image, and mixed prompts follow similar Chainof-Thought structures as REST, we introduce delimiterbased output format using to clearly separate reasoning from the final answer, as models extensively reason. (a) ARC - Mixed modality (b) ARC Image modality (c) GSM8K Mixed modality (d) GSM8K Image modality (e) MMLU Mixed modality (f) MMLU Image modality Figure 7. Examples of ARC, GSM8K, and MMLU questions in mixed and image modalities from our REST benchmark. In the mixed modality, part of the content (e.g., multiple-choice options or context) is provided as text while the rest is rendered as an image. In the image modality, the entire content is rendered as single image. For the OCR verification task, we provide explicit formatting instructions requiring models to number each equation sequentially (1), (2), (3), etc. This structured format serves two purposes: it allows us to verify that models correctly identify the semantic structure of the equations, and it simplifies parsing and validation of OCR outputs, as we noticed different (correct) output formats for models. 9.4. Model Configuration and Hardware We conduct all experiments using vLLM [19] for computational efficiency. Temperature is set to 0 for deterministic outputs across all models where configurable. For proprietary models, we apply the following settings: GPT-5-mini uses minimal reasoning effort (temperature control unavailable), Claude Haiku-4.5 has thinking mode disabled, and Gemini-2.5 Flash Lite operates with thinking budget set to 0. Despite these computational optimisations, all models receive identical Chain-of-Thought prompting instructions to ensure fair comparison. Open-source models follow vLLMs recommended configurations for optimal performance. Experiments run on single-GPU systems: NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada (48GB VRAM) for most models, and NVIDIA H100 (80GB VRAM) for larger models (Mistral-Small-3.1-24B and Qwen2.5-32B) due to memory requirements.

Prompt templates used in the REST benchmark for evaluating cross-modal consistency across MMLU, ARC, GSM-Symbolic. Each modality (text, image, mixed) receives task-specific instructions while maintaining consistent Chain-of-Thought reasoning requirements and standardized answer formatting. The OCR verification prompt (d) ensures that text recognition capabilities are assessed independently from reasoning performance. For non-MMLU benchmarks, prompts follow identical structures with minor adaptations: mixed modality varies based on whether questions are multiple-choice (options as text) or open-ended (questions as text, context as image).

(c) Mixed modality (d) OCR verification Figure 11. Prompt templates used for SOEBENCH evaluation. Each modality receives specific instructions for solving systems of equations with letter variables. For the mixed modality, clue equations are provided as images while the final equation appears as text. For OCR, we instruct the models for specific format, as models generate different types of correct output formats. 10. Extended Results This section presents comprehensive results for the REST benchmarks, including performance metrics across all evaluation conditions and detailed breakdowns by modality. 10.1. REST respectively. Cross-Modal Consistency Analysis Tables 7 and 8 present RER and CFR scores for the OCR-correct subResults are set and the complete set, given per benchmark (MMLU, ARC, GSM8k-Symbolic, SOEBENCH) with corresponding OCR accuracy rates. Notably, DeepSeek-Tiny achieves 0% OCR accuracy on SOEBENCH, resulting in worst-case consistency scores for this model-benchmark combination. The minimal difference between OCR-correct and full dataset scores validates our approach of constraining OCR complexity: cross-modal inconsistency persists even when text recognition is perfect, confirming that the phenomenon stems from fundamental reasoning differences rather than recognition failures. Modality-Specific Performance Tables 9 and 10 provide accuracy scores across text, image, and mixed modalities for both evaluation subsets. Character Error Rate (CER) metrics provide quantitative assessment of OCR performance across models. We additionally report results for the OCR-first strategy, which yields mixed outcomes, improving performance for some model-benchmark combinations while degrading others. Notably, Max Modal Coverage (MMC) analysis reveals that several models achieve near-perfect solvability when considering their best-performing modality: GPT-5-mini attains 100% MMC on SOEBENCH, 96.0% on ARC, and 97.3% on GSM8k-Symbolic. However, this high coverage does not translate to consistent performance. The same model exhibits variation across modalities, highlighting the gap between potential and realised performance under different input formats. Distribution of Solvable Questions Figures 12 and 13 present staircase plots visualizing the cumulative distribution of correctly solved questions across modality combinations. These plots reveal distinct patterns: models with high consistency (e.g., GPT-5-mini) show steep initial rises with most questions solved across all modalities, while less consistent models exhibit gradual staircases indicating substantial modality-dependent performance variation.

REST+ Cross-modal Consistency Tables 11 and 12 present REST+ performance metrics across all visual permutations. We report RER consistency scores, modality-specific accuracies, and OCR success rates for both the OCR-correct subset and the complete dataset. Image accuracy represents the mean performance across all 10 visual permutations per question. Consistent with REST findings, text modality systematically outperforms image modality across all models. The reduced OCR accuracy demonstrates that lower resolution substantially impacts both text recognition and downstream reasoning. Table 11. REST+ performance on OCR-correct subset.

Results reveal distinct model robustness patterns: while some models (DeepSeek-Small, Mistral-Small) exhibit performance degradation at lower resolutions, others (Qwen2.5-32B, InternVL3-14B) maintain stable performance across the different DPI levels. Influence of Font Family Tables 15 and 16 present fontspecific performance metrics across DejaVu Sans, Courier New, and Cursive font families. Most models demonstrate consistent performance across font families. Claude Haiku4.5 shows performance drop specifically for Courier New in the complete dataset (but not in the OCR-correct subset), suggesting that it struggles with OCR on monospace font characteristics rather than having inherent reasoning limitations. Table 12. REST+ performance on complete dataset. Comprehensive evaluation, including all questions regardless of OCR success.

We report performance for black text across all resolutions and specifically at 200 DPI to enable fair comparison with colored variants (all rendered at 200 DPI). Remarkably, every evaluated model achieves higher accuracy with at least one colour compared to black text at equivalent resolution. Token Usage Finally, we show the number of tokens used by MLLMs in text and at the different DPI levels in Table 19. As mentioned in the paper, we see that fewer text tokens are needed to achieve the same level of accuracy, or more Table 14.

To this end, we plot the RER scores of REST and REST+ against scores on MMMU [44], see Figure 14. The MMMU scores were found on public benchmarks1. Generally, we 1https://mmmubenchmark.github.io/#leaderboard, https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudehaiku45, do find such correlation, both for REST and REST+.
