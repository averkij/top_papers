Models like GPT-4\nTurbo with 128K tokens [24], Claude 3 with 200K tokens [1], and\nGemini 1.5 Pro with up to 1M tokens [28] have led to claims in\nindustry discussions and technical commentaries that Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) [19] may become obsolete: a senti-\nment echoed across industry blogs and technical media. The under-\nlying assumption is straightforward: if an LLM can process entire\ndocument collections within its context window, why bother with\nthe complexity of retrieval systems?",
            "content": "However, this narrative oversimplifies multifaceted challenge. Recent research has exposed critical limitations of long-context LLMs: the \"lost in-the-middle\" phenomenon [21] where relevant information buried in long contexts is often overlooked, with performance varying significantly based on information placement [17], quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms [36] Corresponding author. Email:lincharliesun@gmail.com 1 making large-scale deployment prohibitively expensive, and insufficient capacity for repositories requiring synthesis across hundreds of documents [32, 35]. Traditional RAG systems [9, 19], while more scalable, suffer from semantic noise, which retrieved passages may exhibit high surface-level similarity to queries without containing actual answers [27, 31]. This disconnect between surface-level semantic matching performed by embedding models [18, 22] and deep answer relevance becomes particularly evident in multi-document benchmarks. Additionally, most RAG systems operate at individual document level, struggling with cross-document reasoning tasks such as comparative analysis, trend synthesis, or contradiction detection [13, 37]. Recent structured approaches have sought middle ground: graph-based methods like GraphRAG [7], LightRAG [10], and HippoRAG [11] organize information around entity relations and leverage techniques like personalized PageRank for multi-hop reasoning, while hierarchical methods like RAPTOR [29], TreeRAG [33], and HiRAG [15] construct tree structures over document collections. Yet these advances remain fundamentally constrained by paradigmatic divide. Structural RAG approaches whether organizing information around entity-centric relations and community summaries [7, 10] or employing predefined hierarchical schemas [15, 29, 33], construct static knowledge representations with passive similarity-matching retrieval decoupled from LLM reasoning. Conversely, long-context optimization approaches remain fundamentally reactive, providing LLMs with pre-assembled, largely flat information pools rather than enabling active, structured navigation through hierarchical knowledge spaces. Neither paradigm endows LLMs with the cognitive control humans naturally exercise: dynamically deciding whether to \"zoom in\" for granular details or \"zoom out\" for holistic synthesis based on query demands. Our Approach. We argue that overcoming the limitations of prior RAG systems requires fundamentally rethinking the relationship between retrieval and reasoning. Rather than treating them as separate stages(first retrieve, then reason), we propose FABLE (Forest-Based Adaptive Bi-Path LLM-Enhanced Retrieval), unified framework where LLMs actively participate in both organizing knowledge structures and dynamically navigating them according to query-specific cognitive demands. Unlike prior structured RAG methods, FABLE treats retrieval as query-conditioned navigation problem over LLM-constructed semantic hierarchies, rather than static similarity matching over pre-defined structures. Our key insight is twofold: (1) LLMs should not merely consume retrieved Figure 1: Overview of FABLE, forest-based adaptive bi-path LLM-enhanced retrieval framework information but actively construct semantically meaningful, multigranularity knowledge hierarchies during indexing; (2) retrieval should not follow one-size-fits-all logic but adaptively employ different traversal strategies based on query characteristics. FABLE implements this vision through three core innovations: Hierarchical Knowledge Forests: LLMs dynamically organize information into multi-level semantic hierarchies, enabling structured reasoning across both fine-grained details and high-level summaries. Importantly, indexing is one-time offline process, amortized across all queries, and can be performed incrementally. In contrast, long-context inference incurs per-query quadratic costs. Query-Conditioned Traversal: Retrieval is treated as an active navigation process, allowing the model to decide when to \"zoom in\" for granular content or \"zoom out\" for holistic synthesis, directly operationalizing the cognitive control humans exercise during reasoning. Bi-Path Retrieval: Unlike prior graphor tree-based RAG methods that rely on single static traversal, FABLE simultaneously employs semantic navigation path and structural aggregation path. This bi-path mechanism allows per-query adaptive exploration, ensuring that retrieval both captures deep semantic relevance and preserves document-level structural integrity capability absent in existing structured or long-context RAG approaches. These innovations unify retrieval and reasoning in FABLE, overcoming the static and decoupled limitations of prior methods, and enabling query-adaptive, multi-granularity access for complex multidocument tasks. We evaluate FABLE on synthetic and real-world multi-hop QA and large-scale agent tasks, demonstrating significant gains in effectiveness and efficiency. Superior reasoning with fewer hallucinations. FABLE achieves 93.65% completeness with low hallucination (5.37%) and irrelevance (2.52%), gaining +7.0 EM on HotpotQA and +8.0 EM on 2Wiki over structured RAG baselines. Dramatic token efficiency. FABLE matches full-context LLM performance (517K tokens) using only 31K tokens( 21.5K for LLM to select docs, 1.5K for LLM to select nodes, and 8K as the input for generator) up to 94% reduction, while achieving 92.07% completeness vs. Gemini-2.5-Pros 91.05% with full context. Complementary bi-path strengths. Bi-path fusion improves completeness by +1.6 points at 4K tokens; node-level navigation achieves 81.6% at 1K tokens (+30 points over flat retrieval). Scalability to large-scale collections. On BrowseCompplus (100K+ docs), FABLE boosts agent accuracy to 66.60% (+22.14) and recall to 76.60% (+14.28) while reducing search calls to 21.74, without changing the agent LLM. Contributions. This work makes the following contributions: Unified hierarchical retrieval-reasoning framework: FABLE integrates LLM-driven semantic structuring with budget-adaptive bi-path navigation over multi-granularity semantic forests, enabling dynamic balance between coverage breadth and detail depth. Bi-path mechanisms at multiple granularities: We introduce complementary bi-path retrieval combining depthadaptive LLM selection with vector retrieval at document level, and hierarchical navigation with TreeExpansions structural propagation at node level, capturing both symbolic understanding and embedding similarity while exploiting structural relationships. Budget-adaptive routing: FABLE dynamically adjusts retrieval granularity based on budget constraints with structureaware fusion and position-preserving ordering, avoiding unnecessary fine-grained retrieval when coarse results suffice. Comprehensive evaluation: Results across diverse benchmarks show FABLE consistently achieves superior balance between completeness and faithfulness, outperforming structured RAG and full-context LLMs across multiple real-world QA and agent tasks."

Subsequent analyses further confirm strong positional biases in practical attention utilization. Moreover, long-context inference incurs significant computational and economic costs due to the quadratic complexity of attention, making it expensive for large-scale or production use. As result, several studies argue that retrieval-based methods remain more efficient and reliable for tasks requiring precise information access or multi-document reasoning, motivating hybrid designs that combine retrieval with selective long-context modeling."

We compare 3 against HippoRAG2 as the SOTA structured RAG baseline, which has been shown to outperform RAPTOR, GraphRAG, and LightRAG in recent evaluations.

Progressive Construction for Long Documents. For documents exceeding the LLM context limit, we employ batch-wise tree construction strategy by partitioning the document into sequential parts. Each part is independently processed to build partial tree. The final document tree is obtained by merging all partial trees. This approach enables scalable long-document processing while maintaining cross-part semantic coherence.

This adaptive mechanism avoids unnecessary fine-grained retrieval overhead when coarse-grained results suffice, significantly improving efficiency for queries with limited relevant scope. Node-Level Bi-Path Recall. When budget constraints necessitate fine-grained retrieval, FABLE activates node-level bi-path selection within the fused document set. The LLM-guided path performs hierarchical navigation through hierarchical non-leaf nodes, progressively narrowing down to relevant semantic nodes. In parallel, we employ Structure-Aware Propagation TreeExpansion over the semantic tree to supplement vector retrieval. Traditional dense retrieval operates in flat embedding space, missing valuable parent-child relationships encoded in our hierarchical structure. We propagate relevance through tree edges by combining three signals: (1) direct query-node similarity, (2) ancestor-inherited relevance (capturing topic continuity), and (3) child-aggregated relevance (capturing subtopic importance). For node 𝑣, composite score is: 𝑆 (𝑣) = 1 3 (cid:16) 𝑆sim (𝑣) + 𝑆inh (𝑣) + 𝑆child (𝑣) (cid:17) (7) where 𝑆sim (𝑣) = cos(e𝑣, e𝑞)/depth(𝑣) applies depth decay to favor high-level abstractions, 𝑆inh (𝑣) = max𝑢 Anc(𝑣) 𝑆sim (𝑢) inherits the maximum ancestor score, and 𝑆child (𝑣) = avg𝑐 Children(𝑣) 𝑆 (𝑐) 5 Algorithm 2 NodeFusion Input: Nllm, Ntreexp Output: Ordered chunks Cordered 1: // Ancestor-descendant deduplication 2: Ndedup RemoveDescendants( Nllm Ntreexp ) 3: 4: // Document-level sorting 5: Dllm Docs( Ndedup Nllm ) 6: Dtreexp Docs( Ndedup Ntreexp ) Dllm 7: 8: // Intra-document sorting 9: Nordered [ ] 10: for 𝑑 [ Dllm, Dtreexp ] do 11: 12: 13: end for 14: 15: // Extract chunks 16: Cordered GetChunks( Nordered ) 17: 18: return Cordered N𝑑 sort_by_position_order_in_d( Ndedup Tree(𝑑 ) ) Append N𝑑 to Nordered aggregates child scores. We assign uniform weights (1/3 each) to the three relevance signals. No special tuning or optimization was performed for these weights; despite their simplicity, this scheme works robustly across diverse document structures, preserves interpretability, and enables efficient local graph diffusion over the semantic trees. Node-Level Fusion Strategy. The final fusion operation (Algorithm 2) integrates results through three steps: (1) Structure-aware deduplication removes redundant ancestor-descendant pairs by retaining ancestor subtrees that encompass descendant content, (2) Priority-based partitioning separates LLM-selected nodes llm from tree-expanded nodes treexp, and (3) Position-preserving ordering sorts nodes within each document by their original positions, concatenating LLM results before TreeExpansion results. This strategy ensures that explicitly identified relevant content precedes structurally inferred context while maintaining document-native reading order, providing generation models with optimally arranged retrieved evidence. TreeExpansion Details. TreeExpansion traverses each tree in Dfusion, computing scores via Eq. 4 recursively (bottom-up for 𝑆child, top-down for 𝑆inh). Nodes are ranked by 𝑆 (𝑣) and greedily selected until budget 𝐵max is exhausted, with ancestor nodes taking priority to avoid redundancy. Complexity is 𝑂 (𝑉𝑖 𝐷) per tree where 𝐷 is depth. Budget Control. Given the maximum input length 𝐵max of the generation model, dynamically adjust the retrieval results through greedy algorithms or knapsack problem solvers: Cfinal = {𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑘 } 𝑘 = max (cid:40) 𝑘 (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) 𝑘 𝑖=1 (cid:41) ℓ (𝑐𝑖 ) 𝐵max (8) The bi-path design at both granularities ensures robust recall: LLM-guided paths capture semantically precise matches through structured reasoning over hierarchical abstractions, while multigranularity vector or tree-based paths provide coverage over diverse Table 1: Results on synthetic and real-world multi-hop QA benchmarks.

            "content": "We additionally evaluate several strong large language models, including Qwen3-32B [34], Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Gemini-2.5-Pro. For these evaluations, all documents from the benchmark are concatenated and fed to the LLMs to leverage their long-context capabilities. When the total content exceeds the models context window, we process the documents in parallel batches and aggregate the outputs to produce the final answer. For TreeRAG, we report results on DragSingleZh as provided in the original paper [33]. For all other methods, we conduct experiments under consistent experimental settings as described. The results are reported in Table 1. Across synthetic knowledge benchmarks, traditional RAG baselines (BM25 and BGE-M3) exhibit reasonable recall but suffer from low EIR and relatively high hallucination and irrelevance, indicating limited ability to aggregate and reason over multiple retrieved documents. Structure-enhanced baselines partially alleviate this issue: while TreeRAG improves recall and EIR on DragonBall/DragSingleZh, its applicability is limited to specific settings, and methods such as LongRefiner and HippoRAG2 still show clear trade-off between completeness and faithfulness, with increased hallucination under complex multi-hop reasoning. In contrast, LLM-in-context inference with full documents, despite achieving perfect recall by construction, does not consistently translate retrieval coverage into correct reasoning. Models such as Qwen3-32B exhibit substantial hallucination and low completeness, highlighting that long-context capacity alone is insufficient for structured multi-document reasoning. Even strong proprietary models (Gemini-2.5-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Pro), while significantly reducing hallucination, still lag behind our method in terms of overall reasoning faithfulness and controllability, particularly on synthetic benchmarks with explicitly structured dependencies. Our proposed FABLE framework consistently outperforms all baselines across both synthetic and real-world datasets. On DragonBall/DragBalance, FABLE (docs) achieves the highest completeness (92.07%) while simultaneously minimizing hallucination (5.37%) and irrelevance (2.52%), demonstrating strong ability to preserve global document semantics while suppressing spurious generation. Notably, FABLE variants with node-level representations yield substantially higher EIR, indicating more effective evidence aggregation and utilization during reasoning, even when recall is slightly lower than document-level variants. On real-world multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA and 2Wiki), FABLE further demonstrates robust generalization. Both FABLE (docs) and FABLE (nodes) achieve the strongest EM and F1 scores among retrieval-augmented methods, substantially outperforming traditional and structure-enhanced RAG baselines. These results suggest that explicitly modeling hierarchical knowledge structures enables more reliable cross-document reasoning in open-domain settings, where evidence is noisy and distributed. Overall, the results confirm that FABLE effectively bridges the gap between retrieval coverage and reasoning faithfulness. By enforcing structured knowledge organization and controlled evidence aggregation, our method delivers consistently higher completeness with lower hallucination across diverse knowledge regimes, outperforming both conventional RAG pipelines and full-context LLM inference."

This indicates that FABLE effectively enhances retrieval quality, which in turn improves downstream agent reasoning. Overall, these findings highlight that agent performance is jointly determined by the LLM and the retriever, and that improving the retriever alone without changing the LLM, can lead to meaningful 8 performance gains. FABLE demonstrates strong alternative to existing retrievers, particularly in scenarios where upgrading the LLM is costly or impractical."

At 8k tokens, llm-chunks achieves 98.2% of the full-document upper bound (64.5% vs. 65.7%), demonstrating 64 efficiency gain.

This validates that intelligent retrieval architecture is more impactful than simply scaling context or model size. The hallucination and irrelevance metrics show similar patterns: FABLE(docs) achieves superior precision at longer contexts (5.37% hallucination and 2.52% irrelevance at 8k vs. 5.5% and 3.45% for gemini-2.5-pro), validating that vector-based retrieval supplements LLM reasoning with embedding-space similarity signals that reduce false positives."

This highlights the importance of LLM-guided hierarchical navigation for resource-constrained scenarios, directly reasoning over ToC to identify relevant sections. In contrast, vectorbased TreeExpansion may retrieve semantically similar but irrelevant passages under tight budgets. The bi-path FABLE(nodes) (61.9%) lies between FABLE(llm-nodes) and FABLE(treexp) (52.5%), indicating TreeExpansion introduces noise at extreme budget limits.

This pattern holds consistently across Finance and Law domains in both English and Chinese, demonstrating that the architectural benefits are both domainand language-agnostic. The most substantial improvements appear in tasks requiring complex reasoning: Multi-hop Reasoning (+22.8% over baseline) and Summarization Questions (+35.5%), where neither global context alone nor local details alone suffice.

This work revisits whether long-context LLMs can replace retrievalaugmented systems for knowledge-intensive reasoning. We show that increasing context length alone does not resolve core challenges such as semantic distraction, hallucination, and inefficient multi-document evidence utilization. We introduced FABLE, forest-based adaptive bi-path retrieval framework that positions LLMs as knowledge organizers rather than passive consumers. By constructing LLM-enhanced hierarchical representations and enabling query-adaptive bi-path retrieval over global abstractions and local evidence, FABLE balances retrieval coverage with reasoning faithfulness. With fixed LLM backbones, FABLE consistently outperforms strong RAG and structured retrieval baselines, achieving performance comparable to full-context inference with lower token budgets. Our results indicate that gains stem from retrieval-side architecture rather than simply longer context, emphasizing the importance of structured knowledge organization and controlled traversal for efficient, faithful LLM reasoning.
