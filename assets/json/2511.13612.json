Introduction Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) (Comanici et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025) have pushed the boundaries of artificial intelligence from proficiency in symbolic manipulation and general knowledge retrieval to the challenging domain of science-grade reasoning (Bai et al., 2025a; Gibney, 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). This transition marks critical frontier: models must no longer simply align with rubrics or datasets, but must produce outputs that withstand the rigorous constraints of physical reality and natural law. Among all scientific disciplines, physics stands as the sharpest and most unforgiving test of this capabilityit binds abstract reasoning with empirical consistency, forming the very foundation of modern science and technology. Mastering physics requires more than factual recall or formulaic applicationit demands conceptual understanding, system decomposition, and precise multi-step reasoning grounded in physical law. These skills are most rigorously tested in Olympiad-level competitions such as the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) (Qiu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025b), where each problem condenses the essence of advanced reasoning into single challenge requiring both analytical precision and creative insight. As such, physics Olympiads provide high-fidelity and standardized testbed for assessing whether LLMs can exhibit genuine scientific reasoning (Yu et al., 2025a). We view competitive problem-solving as critical milestone toward machine scientific discovery (Oh et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025c). Before models can explore new physical frontiers, they must first demonstrate mastery of human-level reasoning within well-defined laws of nature. Advancing model performance on Olympiad problems is therefore not the end goal, but necessary step toward building AI systems capable of assistingor even pioneeringfuture physics research. In this work, we introduce P1, new family of open-source physics reasoning models that push the frontier of scientific AI. Our design integrates both train-time and test-time scaling, ensuring that the model not only acquires stronger reasoning ability through reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton et al., 1998), but also deploys it adaptively through agentic control at inference. Train-time Scaling. The P1 models are trained purely through RL post-training (Cui et al., 2025a; Guo et al., 2025) on top of base language models. We propose multi-stage RL framework that progressively enhances reasoning ability through adaptive learnability adjustment and stabilization mechanisms. This design supports long-term, sustained optimization and effectively mitigates common challenges such as reward sparsity, entropy collapse, and training stagnation. Test-time Scaling. During inference, we combine P1 models with the PhysicsMinions (Yu et al., 2025b) agent framework, which equips the model with iterative correction and self-verification abilities. This framework enables multi-turn reflectionallowing P1 to reason, critique, and refine its own solutions, much like human physicists do. Through structured test-time reasoning, the model extends its effective problem-solving depth without additional training. We release two variants of the P1 model family and evaluate them on HiPhO (Yu et al., 2025a), new benchmark aggregating the latest 13 Olympiad exams from 20242025. Our flagship model, P1-235B-A22B, achieves milestone for the open-source communitybecoming the first open model to reach Gold-medal performance on the IPhO 2025, earning 12 golds and 1 silver across the full HiPhO suite. The lightweight variant, P1-30B-A3B, attains Silver-medal performance on IPhO 2025, surpassing almost all prior open baselines. Combined with the PhysicsMinions agent system, P1 attains the No.1 overall score on both the IPhO 2025 and HiPhO leaderboards. Beyond physics, the P1 models demonstrate remarkable generalizability. The 30B variant significantly outperforms its base model (Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507) across seven math, coding, and general P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning Statistics Data Composition Total Problems - Problems from Olympiads - Problems from textbooks Total Answers Total Fields Total Subfields Total Answer Types Data Sources Textbooks Olympiad Types - Sets Collected Token Statistics Average Question Tokens Max Question Tokens Average Solution Tokens Max Solution Tokens Number 5,065 4,126 (81%) 939 (19%) 6,911 5 25 6 10 9 199 367 3386 349 Table 1 Statistics of the training data.

This work makes the following key contributions: We introduce P1, the first family of open-source LLMs capable of achieving Gold-medal performance at the International Physics Olympiad level. We develop multi-stage RL post-training framework with adaptive learnability scaling and training stabilization for sustained reasoning improvement. We unveil the P1 ecosystema fully open-source, end-to-end platform encompassing models, training algorithms, an evaluation benchmark, and an agentic inference framework, providing unified foundation for advancing scientific reasoning in the open community. Together, these advances mark significant step toward LLMs that can engage in genuine scientific reasoning and eventually contribute to the frontier of physics research. 2. Physics Dataset 2.1. Overview We introduce systematically curated dataset of 5,065 Olympiad-level, text-based physics problems, designed to advance LLMs toward genuine scientific reasoning. As summarized in Table 1, the dataset combines 4,126 problems from physics Olympiads with 939 from competition textbooks, spanning 5 fields and 25 subfields (see Figure 2). Rather than pursuing broader coverage, we focus on depth and rigorphysics Olympiads uniquely couple abstract reasoning with empirical law, providing an exacting testbed for improving and evaluating model reasoning under physical constraints. Following PHYSICS (Zheng et al., 2025b) and HiPhO (Yu et al., 2025a), we further refine the data construction pipeline by integrating the strengths of human and model annotation, 4 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning achieving finer-grained extraction and higher data quality. This dataset thus bridges the gap between general reasoning corpora and science-grade problem solving, offering high-difficulty, high-fidelity supervision for post-training. Figure 3 data sample from the training data. As illustrated in Figure 3, each instance in the dataset follows structured QuestionSolutionAnswer schema, enriched with metadata, providing well-organized format to support diverse avenues of research. Structured Problem Formulations. Physical problem statements are preserved in their original form whenever possible. For excessively long problems, subdivisions are introduced to respect model context limits while retaining the logical integrity of the task. Expert-Authored Solutions. Solution processes are authored by human physics experts, providing authentic reasoning trajectories. Rule-Verifiable Answers. Verifiable final answers supply the unambiguous correctness criteria required for RLVR. Annotations on type, unit, and scoring points support reliable validation and mirror the weighted criteria of human grading. Labeled Metadata. Each instance is tagged with physics field and source, enabling analysis of domain coverage, guiding data selection strategies, and providing basis for studying the impact of provenance on training dynamics. 2.2. Dataset Construction Data Collection. Our data construction is guided by central objective: enabling LLMs to internalize structured reasoning that aligns with physical laws and empirical consistencya prerequisite for genuine scientific intelligence. We therefore prioritize problems that combine reasoning depth with rule-verifiable outcomesconditions empirically linked to stronger reasoning gains in recent studies (Guo et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Within physics, these properties converge most naturally in high school Olympiad problems: they demand rigorous modeling, symbolic precision, and multi-step inference, yet remain tractable without domain-specific obscurity. This has been 5 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning empirically validated in the PHYSICS (Zheng et al., 2025b), where LLMs perform worse on high school Olympiad problems than on undergraduate non-physics-major questions, highlighting the distinct reasoning challenge posed by Olympiad problems. Accordingly, we assemble two complementary sources. The first comprises ten major physics Olympiads(up to 2023)including APhO, IPhO and othersspanning regional to international tiers and capturing naturally graded difficulty spectrum. The second consists of ten authoritative competition textbooks, offering systematically organized examples and exercises with expert-authored solutions. Data Annotation. Driven both by the demand for high-quality extraction and the heterogeneity of the sources, the construction process is organized as multi-stage pipeline. 1. PDF-to-Markdown Conversion. Source materials in PDF format are parsed into Markdown using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. 2. Questions and Solutions Parsing. Extraction strategies are tailored to the two source types. For textbooks, model-assisted parsing leverages structural cues (e.g., chapter boundaries and numbering) to align exercises with their solutions. Olympiad problems, characterized by lengthy statements and multiple sub-questions, are manually restructured by experts to separate shared background from sub-questions, preserving both readability and fidelity. 3. Answer Annotation. Answers are automatically extracted by models and decomposed into structured lists, allowing each sub-answer to be individually validated against model outputs. Units are separated into explicit fields to support standardized, rule-based scoring. 4. Language Normalization. Problems originating in Chinese (e.g., CPhO) are translated into English with Claude to maintain consistent monolingual corpus. Quality Control. To ensure reliability, we implement multi-stage quality control pipeline, integrating model-based automated procedures and expert review. (1) OCR Correction. Texts parsed from complex page layouts or low-quality scans are manually validated against the original PDFs to correct OCR artifacts. (2) Answer Cross-Validation. Three modelsGemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4oindependently extract answers from each questionsolution pair; Consensus is established when at least two models agree; items without such agreement are removed. (3) Data Filtering. Problems requiring diagram drawing or involving unverifiable answers (e.g., proofs or explanations) are removed. (4) Expert Review. Claude-3.7-Sonnet performs comprehensive consistency audit, followed by targeted manual refinement. After these stages, the dataset contracts from 6,516 to 5,065 items, yielding an English, text-only corpus with rule-verifiable answers, well-suited for RLVR. 3. Approach 3.1. RL Formulation We formulate the problem of solving physics Olympiad tasks as reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton et al., 1998) process. Let = (S, A, 𝑃, 𝑟) denote the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), where: represents the state space, corresponding to the model context, including the problem statement and all previously generated reasoning steps. is the action space, defined over the token vocabulary from which the model generates its next output token. 6 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning 𝑃(𝑠 𝑠, 𝑎) is the (deterministic) transition function, which appends the newly generated token 𝑎 to the state 𝑠, resulting in an updated context 𝑠. 𝑟(𝑠, 𝑎) is the reward function, which evaluates the correctness and quality of the final solution trace. The learning objective is to maximize the expected return: 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝜃 (cid:35) 𝑟(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡=0 (1) where 𝜋𝜃 is the policy parameterized by model parameters 𝜃, and 𝜏 = (𝑠0, 𝑎0, . . . , 𝑠𝑇 ) denotes trajectory sampled from 𝜋𝜃. Policy Gradient. The policy gradient (Sutton et al., 1999) method optimizes 𝜋𝜃 by ascending the gradient of the expected return: 𝜃 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝜃 𝜃 log 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (cid:35) (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡=0 (2) where 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) is the advantage function estimating the relative value of action 𝑎𝑡 in state 𝑠𝑡. We adopt this standard form and instantiate it via GSPO below. Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025a) elevates optimization from the token level (Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025c) to the sequence level, employing lengthnormalized sequence likelihood importance ratios: 𝑠𝑖 (𝜃) = (cid:19) 1/ 𝑦𝑖 (cid:18) 𝜋𝜃( 𝑦𝑖𝑥) 𝜋𝜃old ( 𝑦𝑖𝑥) = exp (cid:32) 1 𝑦𝑖 𝑦𝑖 𝑡= log 𝜋𝜃( 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 𝑥, 𝑦𝑖,<𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old ( 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 𝑥, 𝑦𝑖,<𝑡) (cid:33) , (3) where 𝑦𝑖 denotes the sequence length, and the 1/ 𝑦𝑖 term implements length normalization to reduce variance. The corresponding advantage function is computed at the sequence level: ˆ𝐴GSPO 𝑖 = 𝑅𝑖 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑗= 𝑅 𝑗, (4) with the objective function: 𝐽GSPO(𝜃) = 𝔼𝑥D,{ 𝑦𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1 𝜋𝜃 old ( 𝑥 ) (cid:34) 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖= (cid:16) min 𝑠𝑖 (𝜃) ˆ𝐴GSPO 𝑖 , clip(𝑠𝑖 (𝜃), 1 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖) ˆ𝐴GSPO 𝑖 (cid:35) (cid:17) . (5) 3.2. Instantiation Reward Design. To instantiate the RL algorithms for solving physics problems, we must concretely define the reward function. Following the Correct-or-Not design in RLVR methods (Guo et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025a), we employ binary reward scheme based on answer correctness, leveraging the fact that our physics dataset contains verifiable ground-truth outcomes: (cid:40) 𝑟 = if the predicted answer matches the ground truth, 1, 0, otherwise. (6) 7 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning However, physics problems often involve multiple sub-questions or require multiple final results (e.g., solving for both 𝑎 and 𝑏). To account for this structure, we adopt test-case-style reward aggregation similar to program evaluation, defining the final reward as: 𝑅 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑟𝑖, (7) where 𝑁 is the number of required sub-answers in the problem, and 𝑟𝑖 denotes the correctness indicator for the 𝑖-th sub-answer. Answer Extraction. We design prompts that enforce multi-box output format, requiring the model to place each sub-answer sequentially inside separate boxed environments, in order to simplify the answer extraction. Specifically, we apply system prompt as shown in Figure 4 into our physics dataset. System Prompt of Multi-box Style Please answer the problem adhering to the following rules: 1. Please use LaTeX format to represent the variables and formulas used in the solution process and results. 2. Please put the final answer(s) in boxed{}, note that the unit of the answer should not be included in boxed{}. 3. If the problem requires multiple answers, list them in order, each in separate boxed{}. Figure 4 System prompt design for P1 training. Verifier Design. To handle the inherent complexity of physics answers, which often appear as symbolic expressions rather than single numeric values, we adopt hybrid verification framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based components: Rule-based verifier. Inspired by DrGRPO (Liu et al., 2025b), we combine symbolic computation with rule-based checks using SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017) and math-verify (Kydlíček) heuristics. This allows robust equivalence testing of algebraic expressions, including commutativity, factorization, and simplification. Model-based verifier (used only in validation). Complementing the rule-based system, we follow the XVerify (Chen et al., 2025) paradigm and employ large language model (Qwen3-30B-A3BInstruct-2507) as an answer-level verifier. Given the problem statement, the extracted model prediction, and the ground truth, the verifier outputs binary judgment (correct or incorrect), improving robustness against cases that are challenging for purely symbolic methods. 3.3. Technical Design 3.3.1. Adaptive Learnability Adjustment Achieving sustained performance growth during post-training is key challenge for large language models. In practice, RL fine-tuning often faces performance bottlenecks after an initial phase of rapid improvement (Cui et al., 2025b; Yu et al., 2025c). These plateaus can be attributed to entropy P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning collapse, sparse rewards, limited base model capacity, or imperfect data quality (Cui et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025a). We collectively refer to these factors as reduction in learnability. For example, entropy collapse diminishes exploration capability and thus reduces learnability; similarly, if the model capability and the dataset difficulty are mismatched, the model either fails to learn or trivially solves problems without meaningful updates, again resulting in lowered learnability. To address this issue, especially under the constraints of our relatively small physics dataset, we design adaptive mechanisms that ensure continuous learnability throughout the training process. Specifically, we propose two complementary strategies: preliminary pass rate filtering and adaptive exploration space expansion. Preliminary Pass Rate Filtering. Data quality directly impacts learnability, and even after extensive curation, physics datasets may still contain problematic samples, such as tasks relying on unavailable diagrams or incomplete context. To mitigate this issue, we apply filtering procedure before training, based on pass rate statistics. Concretely, we perform rollouts on the training dataset using the Qwen330B-A3B-Thinking model under pass@88 setting, and exclude tasks that are either too easy (pass rate > 0.7) or too difficult (pass rate = 0). Formally, the retained dataset is: Dfiltered = { 𝑞 0 < pass(𝑞) 0.7 }. (8) This filtering serves two purposes: 1. Removing tasks with pass = 0 or pass = 1 prevents zero-learnability cases. As defined in GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025a), when all group samples share the same outcome, the estimated advantage ( ˆ𝐴GSPO) becomes zero, eliminating effective learning signals. Filtering these tasks mitigates reward sparsity. 2. Removing overly easy tasks (pass > 0.7) prevents entropy collapse. According to the entropy mechanism analysis (Cui et al., 2025b), when the majority of tasks can be solved with high confidence, RL updates push the policy toward low-entropy solutions, accelerating collapse. Given that modern base models already possess strong reasoning capabilities, excluding trivial tasks helps maintain diversity and prevents premature convergence. Adaptive Exploration Space Expansion. Even with curated data, performance bottlenecks can also arise from insufficient exploration (Cui et al., 2025b; Luo et al., 2025). As the model improves, fixed rollout configurations may fail to provide adequate opportunities for exploration, leading to stagnation. To address this, we dynamically expand the exploration space in line with the models evolving capability, thereby sustaining learnability. We consider two complementary dimensions of expansion: 1. Group size expansion. In the GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025a) group-based advantage estimation framework, each training question 𝑞 is evaluated with group of 𝐺 sampled responses {𝑜𝑖}𝐺 𝑖=1 𝜋𝜃old (𝑞), and the relative rewards within the group are used to construct standardized advantages. Increasing the group size 𝐺 enhances the probability of generating at least one high-quality trajectory, especially for difficult problems where success rates are intrinsically low. Larger 𝐺 thus provides stronger learning signal by ensuring that rare but informative trajectories are more likely to appear within each group, which in turn amplifies effective gradient updates during training. This mechanism directly alleviates reward sparsity and strengthens the stability of group-based advantage estimation. P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning 2. Generation window expansion. The maximum output length (generation window) limits the depth of reasoning that can be expressed. If too short, the models reasoning chains for complex physics problems are truncated, producing incomplete or incorrect answers. We gradually extend the generation window as training progresses, allowing the model to explore longer and more coherent reasoning chains. This expansion improves solvability for high-complexity problems and reduces truncation-induced errors. 3.3.2. Training Stabilization Mechanism Mitigate Train-inference Mismatch Recent studies (Liu et al., 2025a; Yao et al., 2025) have noticed that the train-inference engine difference is key cause to instability in training. To formally understand this statement, we rewrite Eq. 2 as, 𝜃 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝜃 𝜃 log 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (cid:35) (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡=0 (9) 𝜃 where 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 denote the policy used to generate trajectories during rollout, and 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 denote the policy evaluated during gradient computation. Modern RL frameworks (Sheng et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025b) often adopt different engines for rollout (e.g. vllm (Kwon et al., 2023) and SGLang (Zheng et al., 2024)) and training (e.g. FSDP (Merry et al., 2021) and Megatron (Shoeybi et al., 2019)). While this design significantly improve throughout, it inadvertently introduce mismatch between 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 due to differences in numerical precision, computation optimization strategies, and 𝜃 kernel implementations, leading to biased gradient estimates and training instability. and 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝜃 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝜃 (𝑎𝑠) 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜃 (𝑎𝑠) (10) To mitigate this mismatch and stablize training, we adopt Truncated Importance Sampling (TIS) (Yao et al., 2025), which applies importance weighting to rebalance gradients computed under the training policy 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 using trajectories sampled from the rollout policy 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 . 𝜃 𝜃 𝜃 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝜃 (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡=0 min (cid:32) 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜃 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) (cid:33) (cid:35) , 𝐶 𝜃 log 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (11) where 𝐶 is truncation hyperparameter that controls the variance of the importance weights. The truncation operator min(, 𝐶) prevents excessively large weights that could destabilize training, while still correcting for the distributional shift. 3.4. Training Dynamics Implementation. For implementation of P1 training pipeline, we adopt the slime (Zhu et al., 2025b) framework, which is efficient LLMs post-training framework connecting Megatron with SGLang. As for base model, we use Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking as starting points of our P1-30B-A3B and P1-235B-A22B. To adaptively adjust aforementioned learnability during training, we periodically resume training from previous checkpoint with updated configurations.

Settings of Different Phrases. We report the settings of different stages during the post training process of P1 models. As shown in the table, we gradually expand the exploration space by increasing group size and generation window. We also apply the train-inference correction technique during the whole multi-stage process. Notely, we build up our algorithm upon GSPO to stabilize the training of MoE models. Besides, we only enable the rule-based verifier during training, the reason for which will be discussed in Section 5.2. Table 2 Configuration of different phrases in P1 training.

As shown in Figure 5, we present training dynamics of multi-stages RL training. It can be observed that the response length of P1 gradually increases during training, revealing the models ability to reason and solve complex problems getting more deeply and requires larger exploration 11 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning space to explore. Therefore, we gradually expand the exploration space by increasing generation window and group size by switching to different stages. Furthermore, as for validation results, we can observe that the P1 models experience an steady improvement on IPhO 2025 during training, revealing the effectiveness and stability of our training algorithm. 3.5. Agentic Augmentation During inference, we scale up test-time effort by incorporating multi-agent framework. We directly apply P1 model into PhysicsMinions (Yu et al., 2025b), which is latest agentic framework designed for complex physics reasoning. PhysicsMinions consists of three coevolutionary studios: the Visual Studio, the Logic Studio, and the Review Studio. Given multimodal problem with diagrams or plots, the Visual Studio first observes, validates, and reflects on the input to extract structured information, which is then passed to the Logic Studio. In the Logic Studio, solver generates an initial solution and an introspector refines it through self-improvement before passing it on. The Review Studio then applies dual-stage verification: the Physics-Verifier checks physical consistency (e.g., constants and units), while the General-Verifier conducts more detailed inspections of logic, reasoning, and calculations. If either verification stage fails, detailed bug report is returned to the Logic Studio, where the introspector revises the solution and resubmits it to Review Studio for verification. This process repeats until the solution passes predefined number of consecutive verifications (CV), which is the only hyperparameter in the system. solution that passes CV checks consecutively is accepted as the final solution; if it fails CV times consecutively, the solver regenerates new candidate solution. This collaborative critique-and-refine cycle defines the systems coevolutionary process, with CV set to 2 by default. Its noteworthy that because P1 models are text-only LLMs, we disable the Visual Studio for adaptivity. In simple words, we instantiate the solver in the Logic Studio as well as the dual verifiers in the Review Studio using P1 models within PhysicsMinions. 4. Experiment 4.1. Experimental Setup Test Dataset. To evaluate performance on challenging physics Olympiads, we constructed the HiPhO benchmark (Yu et al., 2025a), the first High School Physics Olympiad benchmark covering the 13 most recent high school physics Olympiads from 2024 to 2025. These competitions range from international to regional levels and span 7 major types: IPhO, APhO, EuPhO, NBPhO, PanPhO, PanMechanics, and F=MA. The selection was based on both their global influence and the availability of human score distributions1. Comparison Models.

Model Configurations. All models were evaluated under standardized inference setup following the HiPhO protocol. The temperature was fixed at 0.6, and the maximum token limit was set as large as permitted by each model. For every problem, we conducted 8 independent inference runs and computed the average score per problem. These averages were then aggregated across problems to yield the final exam score for each Olympiad. Evaluation Method. We follow the evaluation protocol of the HiPhO benchmark (Yu et al., 2025a) and use Gemini-2.5-Flash as the grader. The benchmark integrates both answer-level and step-level grading based on official marking schemes, allowing partial credit for correct intermediate reasoning. For each problem, the models final score is defined as the maximum of its answer-level and step-level scores, consistent with human grading: correct final answer receives full credit, while an incorrect 13 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning one can still earn partial points for valid intermediate steps. The overall exam score is obtained by summing the scores across all problems. Unlike conventional benchmarks that report accuracy, we use the exam score as the evaluation metric, enabling direct comparison between model performance and official medal thresholds. 4.2. Evaluation on Physics Olympiads Excellent Single Model Performance. Evaluation results are presented in Table 3. As noted above, the P1 model series is trained purely through reinforcement learning. We first demonstrate the excellent single-model performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our training strategy. P1-235B-A22B ranks alongside Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking at the top of the medal table, earning 12 gold and 1 silver medal, and surpassing major closed-source models such as GPT-5 (11 gold), Grok-4 (10 gold), and Claude-4-Sonnet-Thinking (8 gold). Impressively, P1-235B-A22B scores 21.2 / 30 at the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO 2025), ranks Top 3 globallybehind only Gemini-2.5-Pro (22.7) and GPT-5 (22.3)becoming the first and only open-source model to achieve gold-medal performance on IPhO 2025. P1-30B-A3B earned 8 gold, 4 silver, and 1 bronze medal, ranking third among existing open-source modelsjust behind the much larger Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 and DeepSeek-R1. It surpasses comparable models such as Qwen3-32B (7 gold, 6 silver) and Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking2507 (6 gold, 6 silver, 1 bronze), demonstrating strong performance-to-scale efficiency. Agentic Boost. With the combination with the PhysicsMinions system, P1s average performance improves from 35.9 to 38.4, reaching the overall Top-1 position across all models and outperforming leading closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro (37.7) and GPT-5 (37.4). P1-235B-A22B + PhysicsMinions also achieved new state-of-the-art results across four physics Olympiads. The joint configuration outperformed the best compared models on IPhO 2025 (23.2 vs. 22.7), slightly surpassed the record on APhO 2025 (28.0 vs. 27.9) and EuPhO 2024 (23.5 vs. 23.4), and secured decisive advantage on PanMechanics 2025 (77.5 vs. 72.1). These results highlight how the integration of P1 with the multi-agent PhysicsMinions framework substantially enhances reasoning and problem-solving performance, showcasing the model + system paradigm for complex scientific reasoning. Gold-Level Performance on CPhO 2025. We further evaluate P1-235B-A22B on the newly held 2025 Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO 2025), one of the most challenging physics Olympiads worldwide, renowned for its long multi-step reasoning problems. On the theoretical exam, P1-235B-A22B obtains score of 227 / 320, assessed by human experts strictly following the official marking scheme. This score substantially exceeds the top-1 human medalists 199, as shown in Table 4. This demonstrates that our open-source model can attain gold-medal performance on CPhO 2025, marking an important milestone for open-source physics reasoning and showing that it can already match and even exceed elite human performance on some of the most challenging physics Olympiads.

Discussion 5.1. Generalizability of P1 We conduct post-training on specialized dataset to enhance physics problem-solving abilities. Beyond domain-specific improvements, we further investigate: Does the P1 series model preserve, or even enhance, its general reasoning ability across mathematics, STEM, and coding domains? To examine this, we compare the P1 series models with their respective base models across diverse benchmarks: six mathematics datasets (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT (Balunović et al., 2025), IMO-AnswerBench (Luong et al., 2025), AMOBench (An et al., 2025), BeyondAIME (ByteDance-Seed, 2025)), two STEMoriented evaluations (GPQA (Rein et al., 2024), HLE (Phan et al., 2025)), one coding benchmark (LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024)), and general reasoning task (LiveBench (White et al., 2024)). Figure 6 summarizes the results. Notably, the P1 models demonstrate consistent advantages over their base counterparts: P1-30BA3B outperforms Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 across all metrics, while P1-235B-A22B achieves superior performance to Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 in most categories (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, HLE, IMO-AnswerBench, AMOBench, and overall average). This pattern highlights that P1 models not only maintain but enhance general reasoning abilities beyond the target domaineven on more challenging mathematics benchmarks (e.g., IMO-AnswerBench, AMOBench) that test advanced problem-solving skills. These results suggest that domain-focused post-training can induce transferable improvements in general reasoning. We hypothesize two contributing factors. First, the optimization process refines reasoning trajectories in way that transcends domain boundaries, enabling strategies beneficial for mathematics (including advanced subsets like IMO-style problems), STEM, and coding tasks to emerge. Second, the training dataset, while specialized, shares structural similarities with other domainssuch as rigorous symbolic manipulation, multi-step logical deduction, and abstract problem modelingthat underpin general reasoning. Thus, the P1 models generalize effectively to neighboring domains and advanced sub-domains of mathematics, providing evidence that domain-focused posttraining can simultaneously act as general reasoning amplifier. Figure 6 Performance comparison between P1 models and base models on math and code datasets. P1 models present great general reasoning ability across mathematics, STEM, and coding domains. 5.2. Rule-based vs Model-based Verifier for Training As stated in Section 3.4, due to the difficulty of implementing comprehensive and fully correct verification mechanism purely based on rules, we design hybrid verifier that integrates both rule15 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning Figure 7 Training dynamics differences when using an XVerify-like judge during training (P1-235BA22B). The LHS shows the average response length on the training dataset. The RHS shows the total validation points across 5 representative competitions. We can observe that the inclusion of the XVerify judge even exerts negative effects on the post-training process, as indicated by consistent increase in response length alongside degraded validation performance. based and model-based reasoning to achieve broader coverage. However, we found that applying model-based verifier directly in the post-training process can be risky. Figure 7 compares the training dynamics with and without model-based verifier. We observe that the variant employing the model-based verifier exhibits an explosive increase in response length, yet its validation performance deteriorates compared to the setup using only rule-based verifier. We attribute this phenomenon to two primary causes. (1) The model-based verifier is susceptible to being hacked by the policy model. Since the verifier itself is language model, it may develop unintended biases, favoring atypical response patterns such as overly verbose or stylistically peculiar answers, which can be exploited by the policy model to obtain artificially high rewards. (2) The negative impact of false positives (i.e., incorrectly rewarding wrong answers) is substantially more detrimental than that of false negatives (i.e., missing some correct responses). In our observations, while the rule-based verifier fails to recognize certain valid answers, the model-based verifier expands the recognition scope to include more potentially correct samplesbut at the cost of introducing incorrect judgments. This trade-off can be understood in terms of verification precision and verification recall. The rule-based verifier typically offers high precision but limited recall, while the model-based verifier increases recall at the expense of precision. During reinforcement learning, this imbalance can easily destabilize optimization: few high-reward false positives can dominate the learning signal, leading the policy toward degenerate solution patterns. We emphasize that raising this issue is not to deny the value of model-based verifiers. Both verification precision and recall are critical for successful post-training. The key lies in ensuring sufficiently high precision before attempting to expand recall. Only when the model-based verifier achieves stable and reliable judgment boundary can its inclusion provide net positive benefits. Therefore, this phenomenon highlights an urgent need for developing more robust and calibrated model-based verifiers, capable of maintaining both correctness and coverage under the dynamics of RL-based post-training. 6. Conclusion We release the first family of open-source models capable of mastering Olympiad-level physics problems, P1. P1 models achieve great performance on physics reasoning tasks, even reaching goal 16 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning medal performance on the latest Olympiad competitions. These achievements are made possible by the combination of train-time scaling via RL post-training and test-time scaling via agentic framework. Besides physics, P1 models also present great performance on other reasoning tasks like math and coding, showing the great generalibility of P1 series. Looking forward, P1s success in mastering Olympiad-level physics represents key milestone toward LLMs that can assist or pioneer real-world physics research: if models can rigorously solve well-defined problems grounded in natural laws, they may eventually contribute to exploring uncharted scientific frontiers. 7.

Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2025. 22 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning A. Appendix A.1. Test-time Reinforcement Learning Test-time training (TTT) (Sun et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) has received increasing research interest. These approaches adapt model parameters at test time by exploiting the structure and distributional properties of incoming test data. Recent works explore self-supervised RL with various internal reward signals including majority voting (Zuo et al., 2025), semantic coherence (Zhang et al., 2025b), token-level confidence (Zhao et al., 2025b) and self-play (Zhao et al., 2025a). By updating models at test time using RL, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) (Zuo et al., 2025) emerges as promising way to enables the model to explore and improve its performance on unlabeled test set without explicit supervision. In this work, we adopt TTRL with P1-30B-A3B for further improvement due to its representativeness and effectiveness. Specifically, we merge all unlabeled test data of HiPhO, sampling 32 responses per sample. The majority voting consensus (cons@32) is then used as pseudo-labels to fine-tune the P1-30B-A3B model checkpoint for 64 steps with GSPO. We employ batch size of 256, mini-batch size of 32, and maximum response length of 48K. Before training, we filter out multiple-choice questions via regular expression matching. In our preliminary experiments, we observed that multiple-choice questions tend to inflate the majority consensus ratio, which often leads to reward hacking. The validation results (mean@16) are shown in Table 5. Table 5 Performance of our P1-30B-A3B model combined with TTRL on the HiPhO benchmark (note that results presented here are evaluated only in answer level, leveraging Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct as judge).

Case Study This case study examines complex problem from the 2025 International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), which investigates the physical principles of Coxs 18th-century timepiecean ingenious device that harnesses atmospheric pressure fluctuations to generate energy. The problem requires determining optimal parameters to maximize energy dissipation through friction, involving multi-step reasoning that combines mechanical analysis, constraint formulation, and calculus-based optimization. The P1-235B-A22B model achieved perfect score (1.0/1.0) on this problem, demonstrating strong capabilities in: Physical intuition: Correctly identifying the critical force balance constraint at the stop position Mathematical modeling: Establishing proper relationships between system parameters Optimization techniques: Successfully applying constrained optimization to find extrema This performance showcases P1s proficiency in handling competition-level physics problems that demand deep physical understanding and rigorous analytical reasoning. 23 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning IPhO 2025 Question 3-Part 3-C4 Background: In 1765, British clockmaker James Cox invented clock whose only source of energy is the fluctuations in atmospheric pressure. Coxs clock used two vessels containing mercury. Changes in atmospheric pressure caused mercury to move between the vessels, and the two vessels to move relative to each other. This movement acted as an energy source for the actual clock. Simplified Model: The simplified model consists of: cylindrical bottom cistern containing mercury bath two-part barometric tube (completely emptied of air) dipped into the bath The cistern and tube are each suspended by cables through ideal pulleys, attached to mass 𝑀 that can slide on horizontal surface Total mercury volume: 𝑉ℓ = 5 The system experiences solid friction between mass 𝑀 and the horizontal support with magnitude 𝐹s. Two stops limit the displacement: 𝑋 𝑥 𝑋 (where 𝑋 > 0). Key parameters are defined as: 𝜉 = 𝑆b + 𝑆c 𝑆b𝑆c 𝐹s 𝐴 and 𝜆 = 2𝜌𝑔𝑋 𝐴 (12) where 𝑆𝑡 𝑆𝑏, 𝑆𝑐 is assumed. Question: Considering 𝑆b 𝑆c and 𝑆t 𝑆b, determine the expressions for: 1. The optimal friction force 𝐹 as function of 𝜌, 𝑔, 𝑆c and 𝐴 2. The optimal displacement 𝑋 as function of 𝜌, 𝑔, 𝑆c and 𝐴 3. The corresponding maximum energy 𝑊 4. Calculate the numerical value in mJ with 𝐴 = 5 102 Pa Given data: 𝑆𝑐 = 210 cm2, 𝐴 = 5 102 Pa, 𝑔 = 9.8 ms2, 𝜌Hg = 13534 kg/m3 P1 Solution Overview To determine the optimal parameters for maximizing the energy dissipated by solid friction in Coxs timepiece, we analyze the system under the assumption that 𝑆𝑏 𝑆𝑐 and 𝑆𝑡 𝑆𝑏, 𝑆𝑐. The energy dissipated per period 𝜏1 is given by: 𝑊 = 4𝐹𝑠 𝑋 (13) This expression arises from the fact that the mass 𝑀 moves between 𝑋 and 𝑋, covering total distance of 4𝑋 per cycle. The constraint on the system comes from the pressure fluctuation 𝑃1(𝑡) with amplitude 𝐴, which must be sufficient to overcome both the restoring force due to mercury displacement and the friction force. 24 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning (1) Optimal Friction Force 𝐹 𝑠 The maximum force provided by atmospheric pressure fluctuations is 𝑆𝑐 𝐴, where 𝑆𝑐 is the cross-sectional area of the cistern. This force must balance the sum of the restoring force and the friction force at the stop position 𝑥 = 𝑋: Solving for 𝐹𝑠, we get: 𝑆𝑐 𝐴 = 2𝑆𝑐 𝜌𝑔𝑋 + 𝐹𝑠 𝐹𝑠 = 𝑆𝑐 ( 𝐴 2𝜌𝑔𝑋) Substituting into the energy expression 𝑊 = 4𝐹𝑠 𝑋, we obtain: To maximize 𝑊, take the derivative with respect to 𝑋 and set it to zero: 𝑊 = 4𝑆𝑐 ( 𝐴 2𝜌𝑔𝑋)𝑋 𝑑𝑊 𝑑𝑋 = 4𝑆𝑐 ( 𝐴 4𝜌𝑔𝑋) = 0 𝑋 = 𝐴 4𝜌𝑔 Substitute back to find 𝐹 𝑠 : (cid:18) 𝐹 𝑠 = 𝑆𝑐 𝐴 2𝜌𝑔 (cid:19) 𝐴 4𝜌𝑔 (cid:18) 𝐴 = 𝑆𝑐 (cid:19) 𝐴 2 = 𝑆𝑐 𝐴 2 (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) Answer: 𝐹 𝑠 = 𝑆𝑐 𝐴 (2) Optimal Displacement 𝑋 As derived in the previous step, when we maximize the work function 𝑊 = 4𝑆𝑐 ( 𝐴 2𝜌𝑔𝑋)𝑋, we obtain: 𝑋 = 𝐴 4𝜌𝑔 Answer: 𝑋 = 𝐴 4𝜌𝑔 (3) Maximum Energy 𝑊 Using the expressions for 𝐹 𝑠 and 𝑋 : 𝑊 = 4𝐹 𝑠 𝑋 = 4 𝑆𝑐 𝐴 2 𝐴 4𝜌𝑔 = 𝑆𝑐 𝐴2 2𝜌𝑔 Answer: 𝑊 = 𝑆𝑐 𝐴2 2𝜌𝑔 (19) (20) 25 P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning (4) Numerical Value of 𝑊 Given: 𝑆𝑐 = 210 cm2 = 0.021 m2 𝐴 = 500 Pa 𝜌 = 13534 kg/m3 (density of mercury) 𝑔 = 9.8 m/s2 Compute: 𝑊 = 0.021 (500)2 2 13534 9.8 = 5250 265266.4 0.01979 = 19.79 mJ (21) Rounded to two significant figures: 𝑊 20 mJ Answer: 𝑊 19.8 mJ"
