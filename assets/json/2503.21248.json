            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential to assist scientists research as copilot (Luo et al., 2025). One of the most challenging copilot tasks is to help scientists discover new valid research hypotheses, where typical setting is to only provide research question and small background survey as input. Understanding how LLMs perform on this task is crucial for selecting the appropriate models and evaluating how different training strategies influence their effectiveness in scientific discovery. Both authors contributed equally to this work. Corresponding author. However, although there are efforts benchmarking LLMs performance to the general task, such as Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) and MixEval (Ni et al., 2024), it still lacks understanding of the scientific discovery ability of each LLM. One of the main reasons for this vacancy is the lack of understanding of the scientific discovery process, i.e., how each research hypothesis is formulated. Recently, Yang et al. (2024c) decomposed this research hypothesis formulation process into near-sufficient set of sub-tasks, which are (1) retrieving inspirations based on the research question, (2) properly mixing the research background information with the retrieved inspirations to compose research hypotheses, and (3) ranking the composed hypotheses to provide one with the highest confidence. This decomposition is viable because of fundamental assumption that majority of hypotheses can originate from research background and several inspirations. This fundamental assumption is supported by cognitive science findings that creative ideas from the cohesive association of often result two (or more) seemingly unrelated pieces of knowledge (Koestler, 1964; Benedek et al., 2012; Lee and Chung, 2024). The cognitive science findings are discipline-independent and widely applicable. For example, the proposal of backpropagation is research hypothesis. In this case, the research background is about multi-layer logistic regression, and the inspiration is the chain rule in calculus. This research aims at filling the research gap, by providing benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs performance in terms of the three decomposed tasks of scientific discovery. This benchmark covers 12 disciplines, selecting papers published on top venues such as Nature, Science, or journals of similar level. The statistics of the benchmark is shown in Table 1. To construct the benchmark, we download 1386 papers and develop an automated LLM-based agen-"

We invited five experts in Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, and Material Science disciplines to check whether the decomposition is accurate. Among the randomly sampled 62 papers checked by the experts, the decomposition accuracy was 91.9% considering only major issues and 82.3% when including both major and minor issues. It shows that the automated framework can accurately extract these components from paper. To prevent the data contamination problem, we only select those papers published in 2024. The advantage of our LLM agentic framework for the extraction is that as the LLMs pretraining data cutoff date moves forward, the framework can automatically extract more recent papers to avoid overlapping. Based on the benchmark, we systematically compare popular LLMs across the three decomposed tasks. We find that current LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations across disciplines, despite the inclusion of carefully crafted challenging negative inspiration examples. For example, when we ask GPT-4o to select the top 4% of inspiration candidates, the probability that ground truth inspiration will be included in the top 4% is 45.7%. It is surprising because the inspiration retrieval task is actually an out-of-distribution (OOD) task since inspiration is supposed to be not known to be related to the research question but in fact can assist it. Otherwise, the resulting hypothesis wont be novel. In addition, we find that LLMs also have good performance on the hypothesis composition and hypothesis ranking task. This suggests that LLMs could be leveraged as research hypothesis mines, where higher-performing LLMs on the three fundamental tasks of scientific discovery act as richer mines, and more inference compute corresponds to more miners. Overall, the contributions of this paper are: sition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated agentic framework to extract essential componentsresearch questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypothesesfrom scientific papers, enabling the scalable and contaminationresistant construction of benchmarks. We conduct comprehensive analysis of LLM performance using our benchmark, presenting the first large-scale study on out-ofdistribution (OOD) inspiration retrieval. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively retrieve inspirations beyond established associations, positioning LLMs as research hypothesis mines capable of generating novel scientific insights at scale with minimal human involvement."

IdeaBench (Guo et al., 2024) is designed for biomedical idea generation and does not evaluate LLMs based on the full set of sub-tasks in scientific discovery. Their focus is limited to generating hypotheses from background knowledge rather than retrieving and integrating inspirations. Additionally, their reference extraction relies on rulebased methods, which are less accurate than the LLM-based agentic framework. Moreover, their benchmark is restricted to the biomedical domain, whereas ours spans 12 disciplines. DiscoveryBench (Majumder et al., 2024) and ScienceAgentBench (Chen et al., 2024) identify and pick specific discovery-relevant tasks (e.g., write specific code) from 20 papers and 44 papers correspondingly. They do not analyze the fundamental decomposition of the scientific discovery task itself."

            "content": "Yang et al. (2024c) propose fundamental assumption that majority of chemistry and material science hypotheses can originate from research background and several inspirations. Here research background refers to research question and/or background survey; inspiration is piece of knowledge, and it can be also represented by research paper that discusses this piece of knowledge. They propose this assumption based on extensive discussions with domain experts, and the cognitive science findings that creative ideas often result from the cohesive association of two (or more) seemingly unrelated pieces of knowledge (Koestler, 1964; Benedek et al., 2012; Lee and Chung, 2024). Denoting background knowledge as b, inspiration knowledge as i, and hypothesis as h, this assumption can be represented in Equation 1: = (b, i1, . . . , ik) (1) Based on this assumption, they decompose the research hypothesis formulation process into nearsufficient set of sub-tasks, which are (1) retrieving inspirations based on the research background, (2) properly mixing the research background information with the retrieved inspirations to compose research hypotheses, and (3) ranking the composed hypotheses to provide one with the highest confidence. This process can be represented in Equation 2 and Equation 3. Here represents the full literature corpus to retrieve inspiration.

For example, Yang et al. (2024b) shows that this assumption can also be leveraged in social science disciplines to generate high-quality research hypothesis. After extensive discussions with researchers in other disciplines such as Physics, Biology, Earth Science, Astronomy, and Math, we find that this assumption is largely and widely true across disciplines. Based on this observation, we construct this benchmark collecting papers across 12 disciplines in top-ranked venues, develop an agentic framework to automatically extract each papers research background, inspirations, and hypothesis ( 3.2), discuss how negative inspiration papers are selected to evaluate LLMs performance on inspiration retrieval ( 3.3), and present expert evaluation on the extracted information to illustrate the quality of the benchmark ( 3.4). Different from directly assigning score to each hypothesis and ranking the hypotheses based on their scores (Equation 3), this benchmark adopts pairwise evaluation for ranking (Equation 4), since pairwise evaluation is widely reported as more robust and reliable (Si et al., 2024). R(hi, hi+1) = hi represents hi is selected as better hypothesis. = {h1, h2, . . . , hn R(hi, hi+1) = hi for all i} (4)"

            "content": "We develop LLM-based agentic framework to automatedly extract the research question, background survey, inspirations, and hypothesis. The extraction of research question, background survey, and hypothesis is relatively straightforward for LLMs. Specifically, we carefully design prompts and adopt iterative self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023) to extract them. The background survey is summarized based on the information in the introduction section and the related work section. The extraction of inspirations is not so straightforward compared to the other components. Figure 1 shows the inspiration extraction framework. We have simplified its design as much as possible, Figure 1: Overview of the inspiration retrieval framework. retaining only the essential components to ensure efficiency and accuracy. The inspirations are mostly described in the introduction section, usually starting with Motivated by, and can be also described in the related work and methodology sections. As shown in Figure 1, given the full passage of research paper, the inspiration decomposition module first iteratively extracts several potential inspirations. Here each potential inspiration is represented by the title and abstract of referenced research paper. Therefore after the inspiration decomposition module suggests the title of referred paper as inspiration, we use Semantic Scholar and Crossref to find the abstract of the referred paper to compose an inspiration. Then the necessary checker module examines whether each extracted inspiration is needed to formulate the hypothesis and not redundant, and the sufficient checker is to check whether all necessary inspirations have been extracted to be enough to be possible to formulate the hypothesis. Here by enough, we mean the information in the research question, background survey, and the inspirations can cover the information scope of the hypothesis. To prevent data contamination, we apply the agentic framework only to papers published in 2024 or later, thereby minimizing overlap with the pretraining data of LLMs. The cutoff dates for each models pretraining data are summarized in Table 8."

            "content": "Although ground-truth inspirations can be extracted, we need negative inspirations to calculate the performance of LLMs on inspiration retrieval. Here our goal is to provide an in-depth analysis on the inspiration retrieval ability by carefully composing negative inspiration paper set for each paper in the benchmark. Specifically, for each paper in the benchmark, we collect three levels of negative inspiration papers, based on their distance to the benchmark paper. The first-level is papers that are cited and referred to by the benchmark paper, or papers that have high semantic similar titles to the benchmark paper. For each benchmark paper, we collect 100 citationadjacent papers with Crossref API, and 50 semantic adjacent papers with Semantic Scholar API. The second-level are papers that are in the same discipline with the benchmark paper, and the third-level are papers that belong to completely different disciplines (randomly selected). We randomly collect 2000 papers for each discipline by Web of Science, which can be used for both the second-level and the third-level. During experiment, for each benchmark paper, we randomly select 25 negative inspiration papers from each of the distance level to compose the negative inspiration set. The purpose of the three-level design is twofold. Firstly, real inspiration can come from each of the levels. By the splitting, LLMs preference in terms of distance can be analyzed. Secondly, the incorporation of closely related papers makes the negative inspiration papers non-trivial: we find that LLMs tend to select papers that are close to the benchmark paper. If the negative papers are only from irrelevant disciplines, then the retrieval success rate will be very high and less meaningful."

In the first selection round, where 20% of the papers are retained, most LLMs successfully identify around 80% of the groundtruth inspiration papers. Even in the final round, where only 3 papers are selected from the initial set of 75, most LLMs maintain an accuracy exceeding 40%, with GPT4o remaining the best model at 45.65%. These findings show that LLMs can identify papers that were not known as relevant but have the potential to contribute to solving the background question. We think this high retrieval accuracy stems from LLMs pretraining process, during which they may have already captured latent knowledge associations that are not yet recognized by scientists. Table 2 also indicate the scaling law of LLMs for inspiration retrieval: the inspiration retrieval ability grows up very fast before and during 8B parameters, while stuck in bottleneck at around 70B parameters. No matter how the LLMs are trained with different strategies, they seem to be bottlenecked at the same performance. Furthermore, we analyze the Hit Ratio of negative inspirations across the three distance levels. The results are presented in Table 3. It indicates that regardless of the percentage of the papers selected, the closer an inspiration is to the benchmark paper, the higher the probability it is selected as an inspiration. We attribute it to two reasons. Firstly, statistically closer papers objectively have better chance of being an inspiration; Secondly, if certain papers often appear together in the training data, the LLM may see them as more possibly contributing to each other."

For the LLM-generated hypotheses to be comparable with the groundtruth hypothesis for evaluation, here represents the groundtruth inspiration papers (usually 2 to 3 papers), while inspiration retriever module each time retrieve only one inspiration, and will not retrieve the same inspiration again. The detailed scoring criteria is shown in Appendix A.3, where we use 6-point Likert scale (from 0 to 5) to measure whether the generated hypothesis has covered the key points in the groundtruth hypothesis. To compute the generation accuracy, we normalize the average score by dividing it by the maximum possible score (5). The final results are summarized in Table 4.

Specifically, based on the hypothesis generation method in 4.2, we use the top-ranked negative inspirations and background question to construct set of negative hypotheses. From this set, we randomly sample 5 negative hypotheses. Additionally, with subsets of groundtruth inspirations and the research question, we use the hypothesis composition framework to generate another set of negative hypotheses. In this set, we randomly sample 10 as negative hypotheses for ranking. As result, for each benchmark paper, we compose set of 16 hypotheses, including one groundtruth one and 15 negative ones for ranking. To evaluate ranking performance, we use the groundtruth hypothesis to pairwisely compare with each of the 15 negative ones. The prompt for pairwise ranking is provided in the Appendix A.4. Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric, which is calculated as the proportion of correct pairwise rankings out of 15 comparisons. During the pairwise evaluation, we find that many LLMs have strong position bias: they largely prefer the first hypothesis than the second. To avoid this bias, for each hypothesis pair, we compare them twice with reverse positions, and the results are averaged."

This ranking results indicate different scaling law with the scaling law we find in the inspiration retrieval task: more parameters and better pretraining strategies can significantly improve over the hypothesis ranking task, while might lead to less improvements in the inspiration retrieval task. Table 6 analyzes the position bias problem in the hypothesis ranking task. Specifically, each hypothesis pair is compared twice, with three possible outcomes, and the table shows the averaged percentage of each outcome. It shows that many LLMs are hugely influenced by position bias (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B has 91.67% of the time reaching self-contradictory results), and some are less influenced (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet only 19.17%).

Also considering that the three tasks of inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composing, and hypothesis ranking are near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery, it might indicate that given only research background, LLMs can already discover hypothesis autonomously: it can screen lots of inspiration candidates to choose the good ones autonomously, associating the research background with the good inspirations autonomously, and autonomously rank those composed hypotheses to provide the scientists with the best ones. In short, the only input scientists need to provide such copilot is the research background and sufficient number of papers to serve as sources of inspiration. In this view, LLMs can be regarded as research hypothesis mines: models with stronger performance on the three fundamental tasks of scientific discovery represent richer mines, while greater inference compute corresponds to deploying more miners."

Although performance improves rapidly even with relatively small models (e.g., 8B parameters), it quickly plateaus. Scaling up model size or enhancing pretraining strategies yields only marginal gains in retrieval performance. We attribute this to the nature of the task: inspiration retrieval fundamentally requires deep domain understanding, which is primarily acquired during the pretraining phase as the model ingests millions of papers. In other words, success in this task may rely more on the intuition developed through large-scale pretraining rather than the enhanced reasoning abilities typically refined during posttraining. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind how LLMs retrieve inspirations may help address key bottleneck in advancing toward fully automated scientific discovery."

Our benchmark, ResearchBench, spans 12 scientific disciplines and utilizes an automated, LLM-based agentic framework, significantly contributing to scalable and contamination-resistant dataset construction. Our evaluation shows that LLMs achieve promising results in inspiration retrieval, effectively surfacing novel, out-of-distribution knowledge associations. They also demonstrate moderate capabilities in hypothesis composition and ranking tasks; however, performance in these two tasks indicates considerable room for improvement. Notably, we identify inspiration retrieval as key bottleneck, where accuracy quickly plateaus with increasing model scale, underscoring the need for deeper domain-specific understanding primarily acquired during pretraining rather than fine-tuning. These findings point toward promising pathway, positioning LLMs as potential research hypothesis mines. By systematically addressing the bottlenecks identified, LLMs hold great promise for becoming powerful tools capable of autonomously discovering high-quality scientific hypotheses, ultimately facilitating paradigm shift towards fully automated scientific exploration."

Given research question, the background and some of the existing methods for this research question, and several top-tier publications (including their title and abstract), try to identify which publication can potentially serve as an inspiration for the background research question so that combining the research question and the inspiration in some way, novel, valid, and significant research hypothesis can be formed. The inspiration does not need to be similar to the research question. In fact, probably only those inspirations that are distinct with the background research question, combined with the background research question, can lead to impactful research hypothesis. The reason is that if the inspiration and the background research question are semantically similar enough, they are probably the same, and the inspiration might not provide any additional information to the system, which might lead to result very similar to situation that no inspiratrions are found. An example is the backpropagation of neural networks. In backpropagation, the research question is how to use data to automatically improve the parameters of multi-layer logistic regression, the inspiration is the chain rule in mathematics, and the research hypothesis is the backpropagation itself.

Here we mainly focus on whether the proposed hypothesis has covered the key points of the ground-truth hypothesis. You will also be given summary of the key points in the ground-truth hypothesis for reference. The evaluation criteria is called Matched score, which is in 6-point Likert scale (from 5 to 0). Particularly, 5 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers three key points (or covers all the key points) in the ground-truth hypothesis, where every key point is leveraged nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, and (2) does not contain any extra key point(s) that is redundant, unnecessary, unhelpful, or harmful; 4 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers three key points (or covers all the key points) in the ground-truth hypothesis, where every key point is leveraged nearly identically as in the groundtruth hypothesis, and (2) but also contain extra key point(s) that is redundant, unnecessary, unhelpful, or harmful; 3 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers two key points in the groundtruth hypothesis, where every key point is leveraged nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, (2) but does not cover all key points in the groundtruth hypothesis, and (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 2 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers one key point in the groundtruth hypothesis, and leverage it nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, (2) but does not cover all key points in the ground-truth hypothesis, and (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 1 point means that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers at least one key point in the ground-truth hypothesis, but all the covered key point(s) are used differently as in the ground-truth hypothesis, and (2) might or might not contain extra key points; 0 point means that the proposed hypothesis does not cover any key point in the ground-truth hypothesis at all. Usually total the number of key points ground-truth hypothesis contain is less than or equal to three. Please note that the total number of key points in the ground-truth hypothesis might be less than three, so that multiple points can be given. E.g., theres only one key point in the ground-truth hypothesis, and the proposed hypothesis covers the one key point nearly identically, its possible to give 2 points, 4 points, and 5 points. In this case, we should choose score from 4 points and 5 points, depending on the existence and quality of extra key points. Leveraging key point nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis means that in the proposed hypothesis, the same (or very related) concept (key point) is used in very similar way with very similar goal compared to the ground-truth hypothesis. When judging whether an extra key point has apparent flaws, you should use your own knowledge and understanding of that discipline to judge, rather than only relying on the count number of pieces of extra key point to judge. Importantly, we should focus on whether the fundamental key points match, rather than being influenced by how complex, sophisticated, or advanced the proposed methods appear. hypothesis that introduces high-level techniques or intricate methodologies does not necessarily mean it is disadvantage with the ground-truth hypothesis. The core concern is whether the essential key points are correctly captured and utilized.Please evaluate the proposed hypothesis based on the ground-truth hypothesis.

Firstly its about the research background, including finding good and specific background research question, and an introduction of the previous methods under the same topic; Secondly its about finding inspirations (mostly from literatures), which combined with the background research question, can lead to impactful research hypothesis; Finally its hypothesis generation based on the background research question and found inspirations. Take backpropagation as an example, the research question is how to use data to automatically improve the parameters of multi-layer logistic regression with data, the inspiration is the chain rule in mathematics, and the research hypothesis is the backpropagation itself. nNow we have identified good research question, an introduction of previous methods, and core inspiration in literature for this research question. The experts know that proper mixture of these components will definitely lead to valid, novel, and meaningful research hypothesis. In fact, they already have tried to mix them to compose some research hypotheses (that are supposed to be distinct from each other). Please try to explore new meaningful way to combine the inspiration with the research background to generate new research hypothesis that is distinct with all the previous hypotheses in terms of their main method. The new research hypothesis should ideally be novel, valid, ideally significant, and be enough specific in its methodology. Please note that here we are trying to explore new meaningful way to leverage the inspiration along with the previous methods (inside or outside the introduction) to better answer the background research question, therefore the new research hypothesis should try to leverage or research question, can lead to impactful research hypothesis; Finally its hypothesis generation based on the background research question and found inspirations. Now we have identified good research question, an introduction of previous methods, and core inspiration in literature for this research question. In addition, several experts have already come out of several different hypotheses on how to leverage the inspiration to generate novel, valid, and significant research hypothesis for the background research question. Please find the bright parts in these hypotheses, leverage the bright parts from them, modify and combine the good parts of them to generate better research hypothesis in terms of clarity, novelty, validness, and significance (ideally than any of the given hypotheses). It is not necessary to include methods from every given hypothesis, especially when it is not good hypothesis. But in general you should try your best to benefit from every given hypothesis. In fact, researcher has already tried to propose hypothesis based on these information, and we have obtained the feedback to his hypothesis, from another respectful researcher. Please try to leverage the feedback to improve the hypothesis, you can leverage all these provided information as your reference. A.6 LLM Knowledge Cutoff Date"

It means the new research hypothesis to be generated should at least not be completely irrelevant to the inspiration or background research question. In addition, by generating distinct hypothesis, please do not achieve it by simply introducing new concept(s) into the previous hypothesis to make the difference, but please focus on the difference on the methodology of integrating or leveraging the inspiration to give better answer to the research question (in terms of the difference on the methodology, concepts can be introduced or deleted).

Firstly its about finding good and specific background research question, and an introduction of the previous methods under the same topic; Secondly its about finding inspirations (mostly from literatures), which combined with the background research question, can lead to impactful research hypothesis; Thirdly its about finding extra knowledge that work along with the inspiration can lead to more complete hypothesis. Finally its hypothesis generation based on the background research question, the found inspirations, and the extra knowledge. Now we have identified good research question, core inspiration in literature for this research question, and extra knowledge. With them, we have already generated preliminary research hypothesis. We have also obtain feedbacks on the hypothesis from domain experts in terms of novalty, validity, significance, and clarity. With these feedbacks, please try your best to refine the hypothesis. Please note that during refinement, do not improve hypothesiss significance by adding expectation of the performance gain of the method or adding description of its potential impact, but you should work on improving the method itself (e.g., by adding or changing details of the methodology).
