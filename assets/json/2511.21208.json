            "content": "Accurate RUL prediction is critical for enabling condition-based maintenance in complex engineering systems. cornerstone of this task lies in deriving interpretable Health Indicators (HIs) that reliably capture subsystem degradation patterns. While autoencoder (AE)-based reconstruction errors have emerged as popular HI-construction method, existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: (1) sensitivity to noise and epistemic uncertainty, which obscures degradation signals, and (2) lack of granularity in disentangling subsystemspecific degradation behaviors. This work addresses these gaps by introducing 2 Thil et al. novel Ensemble of Indicators framework, which advances traditional AE architectures through multi-head encoders and decoders designed to isolate degradation patterns across subsystems (e.g., fan, high-pressure compressor). We call this method I-GLIDE: Input Groups for Latent Health Indicators in Degradation Estimation. Contrary to prior studies that treat UQ as an auxiliary feature, our proposed method I-GLIDE leverages this uncertainty to enhance HI robustness while maintaining explainability. We rigorously benchmark our approach against established latent-space HI methodsincluding Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) [18, 30] and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout-based uncertainty estimation [9] demonstrating superior RUL prediction accuracy on the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan dataset [29] and the MILL NASA degradation dataset [2]. Our contributions are threefold: 1. Systematic Analysis: We identify and characterize critical limitations of existing AE derived HIs, notably their vulnerability to noise and inability to isolate subsystem-level degradation. 2. Uncertainty-Aware Benchmarking: By integrating aleatoric and epistemic UQ into latent-HI construction, we improve RUL estimation. 3. I-GLIDE Framework: We propose multi-head AE architecture where each encoder-decoder pair targets distinct subsystems, enabling granular, explainable HI extraction, achieving state-of-the-art RUL prediction while providing insights into degradation mechanisms.

As result, the accurate RUL estimation of complex system is heavily studied in engineering, particularly where costs and safety are associated. Early methodologies relied on stochastic approaches, such as threshold-based degradation signatures or empirical lifetime metrics (e.g., flight cycles or mileage) [8].

            "title": "2.2 Evolution of HI Extraction",
            "content": "Early HI derivation prioritized interpretability through handcrafted statistical features (e.g., signal variance) or physics-based models. Using Bayesian framework enriched by expert knowledge to estimate failure probabilities, Lacaille [20] proposed normalization pretreatment to derive standardized signatures interpretable as HIs by domain experts. However, such approaches depended heavily on predefined failure patterns and manual refinement, limiting their adaptability to heterogeneous operational conditions in non-stationary environments [6]. Hybrid approaches combined Kalman filters with NNs to model state-of-charge degradation [12], while others used neural networks (NNs) to learn RUL representation to derive syncretic HIs [33]. Zhao et al. [35] used degradation pattern learning in the case of turbofan engines to predict the RUL. They extracted degradation patterns that helped characterize the nature of the degradation, which can itself be seen as HI. Furthermore, their method was shown to improve the predictive capability of NN towards RUL estimation. AEs later emerged as cornerstone method, using reconstruction errors from healthy-state training as implicit HIs [14, 24, 10]. Despite progress, these methods often assumed linear degradation trends or predefined failure modes, limiting adaptability to non-stationary systems. Other NN approaches later enabled datadriven prognostics, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures capturing temporal degradation in batteries [31] and turbofans [22]. However, early frameworks often bundled HI estimation with RUL prediction, risking conflated objectives where HIs were implicitly tuned to downstream tasks rather than intrinsic degradation patterns. This coupling became particularly evident in methods that embedded domain assumptions directly into HI design. For example, Jing et al. [16] incorporated exponential normalization of sensor data as an inductive bias in Variational Autoencoder (VAE), aligning the HI with the CMAPSS datasets predefined degradation trends. While this yielded robust RUL predictions, it effectively tied the HI to the target degradation profile, limiting adaptability to systems with non-exponential behaviors. Pillai and Vadakkepat [27] addressed this issue more directly, proposing two-stage architecture that decoupled HI feature discovery from RUL regression. Their approach improved generalizability by isolating degradation modeling from task-specific optimization, though challenges persisted in interpretability and subsystem-specific analysis. 4 Thil et al. Latent-Space HI Refinement More recent advances focused on refining HI quality through latent-space analysis. Kim et al. [18] introduced the RaPP method, projecting latent representations from an AEs encoder to compute distance metrics that outperformed classical reconstruction errors. González-Muñiz et al. [11] validated this paradigm shift, demonstrating that latent-space metrics from RaPP consistently surpass input-space approaches in HI quality. Their work highlighted the latent space between encoder and decoder as rich source of degradation signals, though subsystem-specific trends remained obscured by holistic aggregation. Despite these innovations, mapping HIs to RUL remains fraught with challenges. Many approaches employ black-box models or simplistic linear mappings [23], neglecting context-dependent HI interpretations under varying operational conditions. For instance, high reconstruction error might indicate severe degradation in one context but sensor noise in anothera nuance often lost in end-to-end frameworks. Recent benchmarking by Rombach et al. [28] underscores this gap, advocating for feature engineering to improve HI interpretability while maintaining correlation with ground truth degradation."

Deterministic AEs, for instance, cannot isolate aleatoric uncertainty due to fixed latent spacesa limitation addressed by variational architectures [32].

            "content": "Uncertainty in prognostics arises from two primary sources: aleatoric (σa), inherent to data noise and irreducible even with additional observations, and epistemic (σe), stemming from model limitations and reducible through improved architectures or training [15, 17]. In order to produce high-quality HIs we make use of the UQ capabilities of AE architectures with an underlying change. Our epistemic UQ focuses on the scalar reconstruction error ϵ = ˆx2 instead of the full-dimensional decoder output ˆx = y. This aligns with prognostics frameworks where ϵ serves as health indicator (HI), reducing dimensionality for easier integration with downstream RUL prediction models (e.g., ). We avoided using raw (the reconstruction) as standalone HI directly because it is 1) outperformed by RaPP methods [18, 11] and 2) our RUL predictor model showed high variance in selecting the best variables when both RaPP and were fed as inputs. Thus we dropped as HI and instead focused in introducing MC dropout to quantify ϵ uncertainties as HI which showed to be better complement. Therefore, the disentangled UQ is performed through the aggregation of our ϵ1..ϵn over MC samples in our VAE architecture: σa = Var (ϵ1, . . . , ϵn fixed WD), σe = Var (ϵ1, . . . , ϵn fixed z). As is deterministic, aleatoric uncertainty σa cannot be isolated in AEs, rendering it undefined. Thus, we can only compute σe in the case of vanilla AE. This highlights the advantage of VAEs for joint uncertainty estimation."

This design addresses the non-stationarity of sensor signals by disentangling subsystem-specific degradation dynamics in the latent space. This separation allows us to apply the RaPP [18] method individually to each encoder. By projecting the activations of the hidden spaces hg(x) corresponding to isolated sensor groups G, we aim to achieve more comprehensive feature extraction, enabling the construction of specific health indicators (HIs). We derive this architecture with two different latent spaces: the first one being in the way of traditional AE named I-GLIDEAE, and in the second version 6 Thil et al. Fig. 1. I-GLIDE Architecture Framework A: Subsystem-specific encoderdecoder heads learn distinct latent representations, fused into shared latent space via reconstruction loss (trained on healthy data).

            "content": "A main novelty of I-GLIDE is to adapt RaPP [18], traditionally used in monolithic architectures, for each subsystem in our multi-autoencoder framework. By moving away from the monolithic approach, I-GLIDE computes group-specific health indicators (HIs) for each sensor group g. Unlike the original RaPP framework, which operates on single encoder-decoder pair, our architecture independently calculates ϵSAP(g) and ϵNAP(g) for each group g, leveraging dedicated encoders and decoders per subsystem. These components share cohesive latent space z, preserving global system coherence while isolating localized anomalies. For sensor group g, let hg,l(x) Rnl denote the activations of the l-th enInput Groups for Latent Health Indicator in Degradation Estimation 7 coder layer (with nl-dimensional output) for input x, and hg,l(ˆxg) represent the reconstructed activations across layers (l = 1, . . . , L). We redefine two HIs per sensor group: ϵSAP(g)(x) = hg(x) hg(ˆx) (1) which computes the first RaPP metric: the Simple Aggregation along Pathway (SAP) [18] as the Euclidean distance between original and reconstructed activations across all layers l. For the second RaPP metric, Normalized Aggregation along Pathway (NAP), we first derive the group-specific distance vector dg(x) = hg(x) hg(ˆx), where hg(x) = [hg,1(x), . . . , hg,L(x)] concatenates activations across all layers l. Given training set , let Dg be matrix whose rows correspond to dg(xi) for xi , and let Dg denote the column-wise centered version of Dg. The NAP metric for group is then: ϵNAP(g)(x) = (cid:13) (cid:13)(dg(x) µX ) VgΣ1 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) . (2) Here, µXg RnlL is the column-wise mean of Dg, Σg Rkk is diagonal matrix containing the singular values of Dg, and Vg R(nlL)k contains the right singular vectors from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of Dg, with denoting the rank of Dg. This design allows the model to isolate sensor group contributions, where anomalies in specific sensor groups are preserved without being diluted by nominal signals from other groups and this results in enhanced interpretability as HIs directly map to physical sensor groups, aiding root-cause analysis. Building on González et al. [11], where latent-space RaPP metrics outperform encoder-derived counterparts for HI construction, our method integrates both approaches. We compute latent-space metrics (ϵNAPLS , ϵSAPLS ), with ϵSAPLS derived from all the data and not by individual groups."

During training, we focus on samples with RUL 80 timesteps (Rearly = 80) to prioritize early degradation signals while retaining healthy-state representations. For testing, we follow the established protocol by prior works with Rearly = 125 to enable direct comparison. The test set contains truncated trajectories that stop before the point of failure, and the task is to predict this last available value on the trajectory. We present the partitioning of the different groups in table 3. To further validate our approach and compare the effects of subsystem group separation, we test on the MILL NASA dataset, which records 167 unique tool wear progression during milling experiments under varied conditions (depth of cut, feed rate, material). Sensor signals (acoustic, vibration, current) track wear, with failure defined at wear=0.70 (initial wear=0). We classify samples as healthy (wear 0.20) during training and evaluate degradation over three test phases: complete trajectories, moderate degradation (wear > 0.20), and severe degradation (wear > 0.50). Each sensor contains total of 9000 entries, but some have missing data which we fill through interpolation with neighboring values.

Critically, we bypass classical HI metrics like monotonicity or trendability, which often fail to correlate with actionable prognostic value, and instead train random forest (RF) regressor to map HIs to RUL. This choice reflects key design principle: HI quality should be first judged by its downstream utility in prognostics. We then introduce our I-GLIDE architecture, instantiated as I-GLIDEAE and I-GLIDEVAE, which generates subsystem-specific HIs (HIgroups) by isolating sensor-group degradation patterns. These are benchmarked against monolithic AE/VAE counterparts under identical RF training protocols, ensuring fair comparison. By using simple, non-temporal model like RF, we deliberately decouple HI quality from algorithmic sophistication, isolating how architectural choices (monolithic vs. subsystem-specific) impact prognostics performance. 10 Thil et al."

Similar trends hold for VAEs, where HImono achieves 28.44% average RMSE improvement, underscoring the value of UQ in stabilizing HI quality. The same can be observed for the MILL dataset in table 5. This ablation study demonstrates that broader coverage of latent HIs with UQ, collectively strenghtens RUL predictive capabilities, even before subsytem-specific modeling. Next, we deploy I-GLIDE, which explicitly disentangles subsytem degradation (e.g., HPC, fan, turbine in C-MAPSS) by grouping sensor signals into functionally coherent components (exacts group choices are presented in the appendix). Compared to monolithic architectures, I-GLIDE achieves superior robustness, as evidenced by its 39.96% reduction of standard deviation in RMSE across C-MAPSS subsets from AE-based HIs (6). For VAEs, gains are even more pronounced: I-GLIDEVAE reduces RMSE by 39.03% and standard deviation by 56.07%, resolving the instability seen in monolithic VAEs (e.g., FD002/FD003 variance). This subsystem isolation proves critical on FD004-the most complex C-MAPSS subset-where I-GLIDEs average results set new state-of-the-art performance with RMSE of 14.19 despite using only RF regressor for RUL prediction. On the MILL dataset, I-GLIDEs subsytem-specific HIs improve RUL prediction across all degradation phases (healthy, moderate, severe), with I-GLIDEAEdriven HIs achieving the lowest RMSE in every scenario. VAE gains are subtler, likely due to MILLs lower inherent complexity, or high dimensional space which limits the benefits of variational inference. Table 4.

When looking at the expected accuracies of the different models, we see that I-GLIDE has lower standard deviations, being more robust to prediction, which explains why in two cases the best model was monolithic AE: despite showing great performance on single set, its high standard deviation shown in table 6 indicates it would not be robust on broader test set, or in real-life conditions.

Most previous methods were predicting RUL from transformed sensor data without producing HIs, contrarily to our method which does provide HIs.

In contrast, Figure 5 reveals how I-GLIDE isolates these dynamics: the HPC encoder HI exhibits clear upward trend, while the turbine HI shifts abruptly as degradation propagatesa causal linkage masked in monolithic architectures. Notably, the shared latent in I-GLIDE still captures the composite degradation trend, and subsystem-specific decoders also localize fault origins (e.g., rising epistemic uncertainty in HPC vs. stable turbine estimates). This explains why HImono underperformsit conflates cross-subsystem effects into single noisy signal, while our I-GLIDE overcomes these restrains. In future work, we would like to formalize methods to interpret such causal relationships between HIs, identify noise patterns in the degradation signals, and apply it to maintenance tasks. Traditional HI metrics (monotonicity, trendability, prognosability) often produce misleading scores (e.g., near-perfect prognosability) that poorly correlate with actual RUL prediction. Worse, they ignore subsystem-specific degradation, obscuring actionable insights. Our framework addresses this by directly linking HI quality to RUL prediction accuracya metric aligned with real-world decision-making. By disentangling subsystem trends (e.g., turbine wear vs. fan imbalance), I-GLIDE enables targeted fault diagnosis and maintenance planning. While our framework advances subsystem-aware HIs, several constraints merit consideration. First, it is worth noting that both the C-MAPSS and MILL datasets model exponential degradation patterns, which oversimplify real-world scenarios where industrial systems often exhibit linear or piecewise degradation trends. Real-world applications also introduce complex noise profiles (e.g., cyclic sensor artifacts) and heterogeneous failure modes that our method may not optimally capture without tailored adaptations. Readers should be aware that our architecture assumes strictly monotonous degradation, limiting its ability to model recovery phasesa critical shortcoming for systems where transient improvements occur, such as medical devices Input Groups for Latent Health Indicator in Degradation Estimation 13 (a) Latent Encoder HI (b) Latent HIs (c) Epistemic UQ HI Fig. 2.

Furthermore, our subsystem groupings rely on domain heuristics; while this aligns with prior work, poorly defined sensor groupings could propagate biases into the latent representations, undermining HI interpretability."

            "content": "This work establishes the first prognostics benchmark for evaluating Health Indicators (HIs) generated via the RaPP methods, demonstrating that integrating uncertainty quantification significantly enhances their predictive capabilities. Building on this foundation, we introduce I-GLIDE, novel framework that learns subsystem-specific latent representations through dedicated encoderdecoder pairs. By isolating degradation mechanisms (e.g., HPC degradation vs. 14 Thil et al. turbine wear) while maintaining global system dynamics via shared latent space, I-GLIDE captures nuanced failure modes without compromising systemlevel coherence. The resulting high-quality HIs achieve state-of-the-art performance on the C-MAPSS dataset, surpassing existing deep learning benchmarks using only simple Random Forest regressor. Our subsystem-specific HIs advance prognostics but invite refinement. Temporal improvementslike extending observation windowscould better resolve slow degradation signatures and transient noise, aligning HI trajectories with real-world failure timelines. Coupling uncertainty-specific t-SNE visualizations with expert annotations could map latent clusters to physical degradation stages, bridging data-driven insights with domain knowledge. promising direction involves modeling causal subsystem interactions via architectures like graph neural networks, trained on fused HIs to disentangle degradation propagation (e.g., turbine-to-compressor wear). This would scale prognostics to systems with complex interdependencies. Critically, our results show that high-quality HIs paired with simple models (e.g., RF) outperform deep learning on raw dataa \"data is gold\" paradigm. Future efforts should prioritize refining physics-aware HI representationsgrounded in subsystem dynamics and enriched with UQ to unlock generalizable, trustworthy RUL prediction across grounded industrial domains.
