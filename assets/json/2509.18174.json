            "content": "The recent and rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have fundamentally reshaped the landscape of how machines perceive and process complex visual and textual data Hurst et al. [2024]; Comanici et al. [2025]; Zhu et al. [2025]; Bai et al. [2025]. Among the myriad applications of these models, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and comprehensive document understanding continue to present significant challenges. This is particularly true for languages that are morphologically rich and structurally complex, such as Arabic. While contemporary OCR solutions have achieved remarkable performance for English and other high-resource languages Comanici et al. [2025]; Hurst et al. [2024], their efficacy does not readily generalize to Arabic documents. The inherent complexities of Arabic script, including its cursive nature, extensive ligature formation, the wide variety of fonts and styles, the critical role of diacritics, and the right-to-left text orientation, render Arabic OCR task of considerable difficulty. In parallel, progress in multimodal architectures has paved the way for unified vision-language reasoning, which enables models to concurrently extract both textual content and structural inforBaseer: (cid:81)(cid:30)(cid:10)(cid:146)(cid:11)(cid:29)(cid:46): meaning one who sees clearly and insightful.

The process begins with hybrid dataset of 500k pairs (300k synthetic and 200k real-world), which is used to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model. mation from documents Li et al. [2025]; Mandal et al. [2025]. Despite these technological strides, modern multimodal frameworks have seldom been specialized for the distinct demands of Arabic OCR and document parsing. This significant gap in research and development leaves academics, practitioners, and industries without robust, dedicated tools for processing real-world Arabic documents, which are prevalent across academic, commercial, and cultural heritage domains. In this work, we introduce Baseer, vision-language model meticulously fine-tuned for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging the state-of-the-art capabilities of the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model Bai et al. [2025], our approach adapts powerful general-purpose MLLM to the unique challenges of Arabic document analysis. To facilitate this specialization, Baseer was trained on large-scale, diverse dataset composed of both synthetically generated and authentic real-world Arabic documents. This dataset was curated to encompass the extensive variety of formats, fonts, and layouts encountered in practical applications. Furthermore, we present Misraj-DocOCR, novel benchmark specifically engineered for the evaluation of Arabic OCR systems, featuring high-quality, expert-verified annotations to ensure reliability. Our primary contributions are threefold: 1. We present the development and fine-tuning of Baseer, demonstrating that an efficient, 2 decoder-only fine-tuning strategy can achieve state-of-the-art performance in Arabic document OCR. 2. We introduce Misraj-DocOCR, new, reliable, and openly available benchmark designed to provide standardized and rigorous evaluation framework for Arabic OCR systems. 3. We conduct thorough analysis of the KITAB-pdf-to-markdown benchmark, providing revised and improved version that addresses significant inaccuracies to enhance its accuracy and utility for the research community. Through series of extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Baseer consistently outperforms existing open-source and commercial alternatives."

            "content": "The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently been extended to handle multimodal input, leading to the development of powerful models capable of joint vision-language reasoning. Research in this area has generally progressed along two main architectural paths. One approach involves the modular integration of pre-trained components, where specialized frozen vision encoder is connected to large language decoder via lightweight adapter. This design is seen in influential models like LLaVA Liu et al. [2023; 2024]; Li et al. [2024], Aya-Vision Dash et al. [2025], Idefics Lauren√ßon et al. [2024b;a], and more compact architectures such as SmolVLM Marafioti et al. [2025]. These architectures achieve impressive zero-shot and few-shot performance on diverse range of multimodal tasks with high parameter efficiency. The second approach focuses on training massive, end-to-end vision-language models. This category includes state-of-the-art systems such as InternVL Chen et al. [2024]; Zhu et al. [2025], Gemma Team et al. [2025], PaliGemma Steiner et al. [2024], and Qwen-VL Bai et al. [2025]. These models, with parameter counts scaling up to 70 billion in the case of Qwen2.5-VL, have demonstrated remarkable general-purpose capabilities. However, their broad, generalist training often leaves them unspecialized for precision-critical, niche domains. As we will discuss, high-fidelity document OCR represents one such domain where these powerful models still exhibit significant limitations. https://huggingface.co/datasets/Misraj/Misraj-DocOCR https://huggingface.co/datasets/Misraj/KITAB_pdf_to_markdown_reviewed"

            "content": "The field of Optical Character Recognition has evolved substantially from its origins in rule-based pattern matching. The integration of deep learning, especially Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs), marked significant leap, dramatically improving accuracy for text in both scanned documents and natural scenes. More recently, the focus has changed from text transcription to holistic Document Understanding. This advanced task requires not only recognizing text but also parsing the documents logical structure, including layouts, tables, and other semantic elements. This capability is crucial for applications in data extraction, document archiving, and content analysis. Leading efforts in this domain, such as Idefics3 Lauren√ßon et al. [2024a], MonkeyOCR Li et al. [2025], SmolDocling Nassar et al. [2025], and commercial systems such as Nanonets-OCR-s Mandal et al. [2025], have established high benchmarks for performance on standard document types. More recent attempts, such as Qari Wasfy et al. [2025], have tackled Arabic OCR directly, but their scope remains limited compared to comprehensive document understanding systems. However, critical challenge remains: the generalization of these models to languages with scripts that are fundamentally different from Latin-based languages. Arabic serves as prime example of this challenge. Its inherent characteristics include cursive script, context-sensitive character shapes, optional but meaningful diacritics, right-to-left orientation, and wide variety of fonts and styles. These characteristics often cause state-of-the-art document OCR systems to degrade sharply in performance when applied to Arabic texts. To the best of our knowledge, the application of modern MLLM frameworks to the specific, challenging problem of Arabic document OCR remains largely unexplored area. Although several multilingual and multimodal models include Arabic in their training, they are not optimized for the script-specific and structural challenges posed by Arabic documents. This work aims to bridge this critical gap. By fine-tuning powerful, pre-trained vision-language model, we introduce Baseer, system specifically engineered for the complexities of Arabic documents. Our results demonstrate that this specialized approach yields substantial leap in performance, establishing new state-of-the-art for open source and proprietary systems in this vital domain."

To support effective document OCR, it is essential to represent textual content in format that preserves both structure and semantics. In our dataset, the text corresponding to each image is formatted in Markdown, providing clean and standardized representation of content. Tables are represented in HTML to accurately capture diverse table structures and complex layouts. Furthermore, specialized tags were introduced to mark specific elements within the text, including watermarks, page numbers, and the presence of images, enabling precise supervision for layout-aware OCR and document parsing tasks. The dataset itself was constructed as hybrid collection, combining large corpus of synthetically generated documents with carefully curated set of real-world publications. This approach ensures broad coverage of document styles, visual characteristics, and layout complexities. Each of these sources is described in detail below."

            "content": "The first component of our dataset was generated synthetically using an in-house pipeline, designed to capture the diverse formatting and layout variations commonly found in word-processing documents. The foundation for this synthetic data is corpus of markdown-formatted documents, which were downloaded and filtered from the Common Crawl archive using methodology analogous to our previously released dataset. To ensure the quality and relevance of the source material, the raw data were subjected to the following preprocessing filters: 1. Perplexity Filtering: An in-house language model based on KenLM Heafield [2011] was employed to calculate perplexity scores, retaining only the most linguistically cohesive text samples. 2. Table Sparsity Filtering: To ensure structural integrity, documents containing markdown tables with more than 25% empty cells were identified and discarded. The filtered markdown documents were then converted into image-text pairs via four-step rendering pipeline: 1. Markdown to HTML: Documents were first converted to HTML to facilitate the systematic parsing of distinct formatting tags. 2. HTML to Word: The resulting HTML was transformed into Microsoft Word documents, meticulously preserving all structural and stylistic attributes (e.g., bold, italics, headers). 3. Word to PDF: These Word documents were subsequently exported to PDF format to create standardized, page-level representation. 4. PDF to Image: Finally, each page of the PDF files was rendered as high-resolution image, forming the visual component of the training pairs. To foster model robustness, high degree of visual diversity was introduced during the rendering process by systematically varying document configurations, as detailed in Table 1. Furthermore, subset of the generated images underwent an augmentation process involving 29 distinct transformations, which are organized into eight categories  (Table 2)  . From the pool of generated images, 150,000 samples were randomly selected and divided into three equal subsets of 50,000 each. The first subset underwent single random transformation, the second was subjected to two transformations, and the third to three, ensuring progressive increase in complexity. To prevent redundancy, the original, pre-augmentation versions of these images were discarded. In total, this synthetic pipeline produced 300,000 high-quality imagetext pairs, comprising 150,000 clean rendered samples and 150,000 augmented variants designed to simulate diverse real-world document conditions. https://huggingface.co/datasets/Misraj/msdd Parameter Fonts Page Sizes Background Color Text Color Alignment Columns Font Size Margin Line Height Column Spacing Special Formatting Random highlights, colored paragraphs, RTL (95%) Values / Distribution 39 Arabic fonts A4, A5, Letter, Legal, Tabloid, A3 (incl. landscape variants) 8 light shades (75%), 5 dark shades (25%) 9 light, 16 dark Right (65%), Left (5%), Center (30%) 1 (75%), 2 (20%), 3 (5%) Even values from 822 pt 1.02.5 cm (uniform) 1.01.6 (uniform) 0.51.2 cm (uniform) Table 1: Document configuration diversity.

In contrast to synthetic data, these samples reflect authentic publishing environments, capturing genuine layout complexities and typographic conventions. To ensure maximum diversity, the selected pages span broad spectrum of layout complexities, identified using vision-based algorithms. Specifically, bounding boxes were first detected at the paragraph level, and their alignment and overlap were analyzed to capture challenging structures such as tables, figures, index pages, and skewed layouts. Page color distributions were also examined to include samples with embedded images, colorful backgrounds, and multi-colored text. Ground-truth text for the real-world documents was obtained using state-of-the-art visionlanguage model (VLM). To ensure high-quality labels, representative subset of the VLM outputs was manually verified by human experts for both textual accuracy and structural fidelity. This collection is particularly valuable because it contains complex elements not present in the synthetic dataset, including intricate footnotes, varied column layouts, and non-standard typography. From this source, we curated 200,000 document images paired with their corresponding ground-truth text. Collectively, the combination of these two sources results in 500,000 text-image pairs, used for training our model. 6 detailed breakdown of the dataset distribution across sources is shown in Figure 2.

Our initial investigation involved assessing existing benchmarks, such as the KITAB-bench Heakl et al. [2025] pdf-to-markdown dataset. During this analysis, we identified significant shortcomings that compromise its reliability for model evaluation. primary issue discovered was the presence of numerous errors in the ground truth data. We observed multiple instances of hallucinatory text, where the ground truth contained phrases not present in the source documents likely originating from data creation or annotation tool rather than authentic content. Furthermore, our review revealed that many examples lacked corresponding page numbers, and small-font text was frequently omitted from the ground truth. These inaccuracies suggest that the dataset may not have undergone thorough verification process after the initial data extraction. For more details, see Appendix To address these deficiencies and provide more reliable resource for the research community, we undertook comprehensive correction of the KITAB-bench PDF-to-markdown dataset.

Therefore, we introduce Misraj-DocOCR, new, comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating Arabic Document OCR models. The primary contributions of this benchmark are: Diverse and Comprehensive Content: The benchmark consists of 400 high-quality images, curated to include wide variation of document types, layouts, and fonts, and comprising both synthetic and real-world pages. Expert-Verified Ground Truth: To ensure the highest level of accuracy, every image in the dataset has been meticulously reviewed by human experts. This verification process guarantees that both the transcribed text and the document structure are correct, eliminating the types of errors found in previous benchmarks. Open Access: Misraj-DocOCR is open-source and publicly available to all researchers.

The development of our model, Baseer, followed two-stage methodology designed to tailor powerful, pre-trained foundation model to our specific needs. The first stage involved the comprehensive collection and curation of high-quality dataset, the details of which are described in Section 3. The subsequent stage, which is the focus of this section, consisted of fine-tuning the selected base model to align with our data and enhance its capabilities for Arabic document processing. For the base architecture of Baseer, we selected the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model Bai et al. [2025]. This decision was predicated on its robust and state-of-the-art performance on multimodal tasks, particularly its demonstrated proficiency with the Arabic language compared to other opensource alternatives. Despite its advanced capabilities, our preliminary analysis revealed that the base Qwen2.5-VL-3BInstruct model exhibited certain limitations relevant to our use case. These included occasional reversions to left-to-right text generation, suboptimal handling of diacritized Arabic text, and other https://huggingface.co/datasets/Misraj/KITAB_pdf_to_markdown_reviewed performance artifacts. key objective of our work was to mitigate these specific weaknesses through targeted fine-tuning. Our fine-tuning strategy involved updating all model parameters, except for the vision encoder, which remained frozen.

To ensure fair comparison, each of these strategies was tested on 50,000-sample subset of our training data for two epochs, holding all other hyperparameters constant. We evaluated the models using ChrF, which measures OCR accuracy at the character level and captures text transcription 9 quality.

Best values are highlighted in bold and the second-best values are underlined. Table 6 reports the results on the KITAB-Bench PDF-to-Markdown dataset, which was carefully reviewed and corrected by domain experts to ensure high-quality ground truth annotations. This evaluation was conducted using only open-source models for fairness. While Dots.ocr achieves the strongest performance across most text-centric metrics (WER, CER, BLEU, and CHRF), slightly surpassing Baseer, Baseer shows clear superiority in structural understanding, attaining the highest TEDS score (56) and the best overall MARS. It is also worth noting that the KITAB-Bench subset is relatively small, consisting of only 30 samples, which makes every misprediction more impactful on the reported scores. In contrast, on the larger and more challenging Misraj-DocOCR benchmark with 400 diverse examples, Baseers advantage over both open-source and commercial systems becomes more pronounced, highlighting its robustness across varied document types and layouts."

            "content": "In this paper, we introduced Baseer, vision-language model tailored for Arabic Document OCR, and presented Misraj-DocOCR, high-quality benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation. By training on diverse dataset of 500,000 document-image pairs, we demonstrated that decoder-only fine-tuning is powerful strategy that enables Baseer to achieve superior performance compared to wide range of existing systems. Our detailed experimental analysis highlighted the importance of https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence 12 sequence length, fine-tuning scope, and dataset diversity in achieving robust performance. Notably, Baseer consistently achieved the best or near-best scores across Word Error Rate, Character Error Rate, and structure-aware metrics such as TEDS and MARS, surpassing both open-source and proprietary alternatives. These positive results underscore the value of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs, and provide new insights into how tailored data and efficient training strategies can push the boundaries of OCR for complex scripts. We believe that this work establishes strong baseline for future research and will accelerate the development of practical, high-accuracy OCR solutions for Arabic and other morphologically rich languages."
