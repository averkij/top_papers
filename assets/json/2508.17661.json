            "content": "Throughout history, scientific breakthroughs have emerged from the conjunction of seemingly disparate fields of knowledge [14]. Optogenetics [57] has revolutionized neuroscience by introducing lightmediated modulation in neural cells.; CRISPR-Cas9 [810] has changed the landscape of biological research by reinterpreting the bacterial immune system as platform for genome editing. Thomas Kuhn characterized such moments as paradigm shifts, arguing that these fundamental reorientations of scientific understanding cannot emerge through incremental progress. Over the last few decades, academia has witnessed an unprecedented surge in the sheer volume of scholarly publications [11, 12]; despite this, innovations on par with Kuhns portrayal have been rare [13]. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered traction as potential galvanizers of creativity. Supporting this sentiment is the notable performance of LLMs in various benchmarks that measure capabilities in science, programming, and reasoning [1418]. There have already been several attempts to capitalize on these advancements by creating agentic frameworks for scientific discovery [1925]. AlphaEvolve [26] finds solutions for local optimization problems, and multi-agent Virtual Lab [27] uncovers molecule-level candidates for SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies. However, we remain skeptical about whether systems that rely solely on LLMs can initiate artificial paradigm shifts. Transformer-based architectures optimize contextual coherence and penalize outputs that deviate from established patterns. Skewed evaluation metrics and human feedback further reinforce this behavior, leading to complementary systematic bias that favors soundness over novelty [28, 29]. The problem is that while building upon patterns, attempts at creative thinking easily degrade into regressions. For instance, the term CRISPR-Cas9 often recurs when prompted to generate research ideas, due to the overrepresentation of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology as novel research in training datasets. As result, LLM outputs tend to slant toward the precursory prompt context and the training data, implying that an automated ideation system powered by LLMs must overcome the limitations introduced by contextualization. To this end, we decompose information into atomic units: keywords. As keywords do not carry excess context, we may leverage the reasoning abilities of LLMs while circumventing the aforementioned limitations. This decomposition also allows for the compositional construction of scientific concepts, where keywords act as versatile building blocks that comprise diverse combinations. Known concepts correspond to specific combinations of keywords that come together into graph: one that we believe spans humankinds ever-growing knowledge base. Furthermore, we assert that we can automate paradigm-shifting discoveries through the structural examination of this graph. As such, we propose Spacer, two-step scientific discovery system designed to foster probable but unexplored connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. Nuri, an inspiration engine, extracts potent sets of keywords from the global keyword graph. The Manifesting Pipeline then substantiates each set into concrete scientific statement that potentially expands the boundaries of science. 3 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration 2. Spacer Spacer is scientific discovery system. The goal of Spacer is to generate original scientific concepts distinct from those seen in its training datasets or search results, while complying with academic standards. Whereas next-token prediction models have been unsuccessful in creating original scientific concepts, Spacer overcomes their limitations by operating on multi-stage pipeline with both LLM and non-LLM components."

            "content": "The core conceptual and technical backbone of Spacer is the deliberate decontextualization of information. We define deliberate decontextualization as the intentional removal of inferable contextual information: sentences, paragraphs, or any structured text that would encourage the language model to rely on familiar patterns or established knowledge. We have approached the problem of developing Spacer based on the decontextualization of information for the following two reasons. First, significant scientific breakthroughs often emerge from unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, rather than from next-step extensions of existing knowledge. Second, decontextualization enables multi-LLM framework to generate contexts beyond its knowledge span. LLMs next-token prediction engines are antithetical to the concept of decontextualization. As mentioned above, the outputs of LLMs are constructed upon heavy contextual bias when given specific task. While excelling in logical writing and elaboration, they cannot make new conceptual connections necessary for scientific inspiration. Therefore, Spacer conceives scientific inspiration before introducing LLMs. non-LLM component first generates novel connections between concepts from decontextualized information, then passes them to LLMs for construction into scientific concepts. Completely separating the ideation from LLMs, the workflow preserves the emergent properties while developing scientific significance using multi-agent LLM frameworks. The atomic unit of decontextualization in Spacer is word. That is, we seek original knowledge in the combinations of scientific terms. Regarding our assertion that unexpected conceptual connections can lead to scientific breakthroughs, set of scientific terms is fine starting point for ideas to accumulate. From the perspective of format, wordsthe results of decontextualizationare the optimal point for LLMs to operate on. token does not preserve the original meaning of words; larger units, such as phrases or sentences, carry contextual bias. Therefore, set of words is format that manifests scientific inspiration while allowing LLMs to understand and develop meaning without contextual bias. To summarize, we deliberately decontextualize scientific information to free LLMs from contextual dependencies. We adopt an hybrid approach where LLMs only build upon given set of scientific words that already contains emergent knowledge. Such an approach enables the system to access novel scientific discoveries while also maintaining logical soundness and scientific compatibility. This meet-in-the-middle approach is implemented in Spacer as three consecutive stages: word selection, word combination1, and agentic reinforcement. Scientific knowledge is decontextualized into words, then selected to generate new connections and findings. All emergent characteristics of Spacer originate from the word selection stage. The following steps involve LLMs to combine words into sentences that reveal the idea and reinforce it with rationales and logical refinement. The specific architecture and design of the frameworks are discussed in depth in the following section. 1One might argue that involving LLMs in the word combination stage is contradictory to the principle of deliberate decontextualization. However, since Spacer devotes inspiration to the word selection stage, there are no creative tasks involved in word combination. 4 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration"

            "title": "2.2 Architecture",
            "content": "We first define the key terms used throughout this report, each corresponding to different level of scientific discovery. Keywords are individual decontextualized words that carry specific meaning. Biological entities, scientific techniques, or established concepts may all serve as keywords. Theses are individual paragraphs aiming to capture researchers initiative. These may resemble abstracts but omit resultant details such as findings, data, expected impacts, or speculative outcomes. Finally, when Theses are organized into structured formats, they form Statements: 12-sentence-length concepts accompanied by supporting set of rationales. Figure 2: Architecture of Spacer. Spacer consists of four primary components organized in sequential pipeline. Nuri builds set of keywords that involve semantical richness while minimizing contextual dependencies. The Revealing Framework transforms these keywords into Theses, which are then elevated to Statements by the Scaffolding Framework. Lastly, the Assessment Framework evaluates Statements to accept or reject them based on their overall plausibility. This design allows Spacer to separate creative generation from critical evaluationNuri is devoted to addressing creativity, while the others focus on materializing Statement without subverting the original concept. This architecture is illustrated in Figure 2. The continuing sections establish each of the four components in detail. Nuri Nuri2 is graph-based Keyword Set extraction algorithm. We designed Nuri to select Keyword Sets, as connections between keywords reveal information not evident in individual keywords. We believe that complex scientific ideassuch as the motivations behind existing research paperscan be represented in the form of these connections. Accordingly, we designed Nuri to collect Keyword Sets that are likely to harness novel research directions that lead to impactful research papers. For published papers, we employed the Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) as primary metric for impactfulness. FWCI compares the number of citations paper receives against the average number of citations in the same field and year. For example, an FWCI value greater than 1 indicates that the paper has been cited more frequently than average. As citation practices differ across fields, FWCI offers compensation that allows for fair comparison of scientific impact. We had also considered using the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), another index that rates impactful papers based on citation rate counts [30]. However, given that these two indices are mostly interchangeable with each other [31], we chose 2The name Nuri originates from the Korean word for world. 5 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration FWCI over RCR for its abundance in precomputed values. To be precise, Nuri makes graph with set of papers, and an evaluation function which can determine whether Keyword Set would be impactful. For given set of papers 𝑃, let ( 𝑝) be the Keyword Set of paper 𝑝 𝑃. We define the undirected and weighted graph 𝐺(𝑃) as 𝑉 (𝐺(𝑃)) = ( 𝑝), (cid:216) 𝑝 𝑃 𝑤(𝑢, 𝑣) = log2 𝑝 𝑃 𝑢,𝑣 ( 𝑝) (FWCI( 𝑝) + 1) ( 𝑝) 1 . (1) (2) The weight of each edge represents the joint academic impact of the two keywords as sum of normalized logarithmic FWCI values of the papers containing both vertices. The evaluation function 𝑓𝑃 takes Keyword Set 𝐾 𝑉 (𝐺(𝑃)) and outputs normalized score 𝑠 [0, 1], representing the potential impact of the input keywords. Nuri uses 𝑓𝑃 and applies various heuristics to create its final output set. We note that Nuri does not invoke any machine learning methods or LLMs in its process, nor does it require any input from the user. The Revealing Framework Figure 3: Schematic of the Revealing Framework. The Revealing Framework takes Keyword Set and finds plausible interconnection between them, forming Thesis. The input keywords selected by the preceding engineNurihave the potential to establish unexplored scientific propositions. When applied to such keywords, the Revealing Framework realizes the latent concept in the connections and formulates it into communicable natural language. The primary component of the Revealing Framework is Weaver. Weaver is an LLM trained on academic papers, fine-tuned to reconstruct research initiatives from segments of these papers. Taking Keyword Set from Nuri, Weaver materializes sentence-length research concept from the knowledge concealed within the word set. As shown in Section 4.2, Weaver yields logical, novel, and plausible research initiatives from well-structured input keywords. To stabilize the quality of outputs from Weaver, we applied keyword refinement engine to the original Keyword Set, vetting and replacing inadequate or unnecessary keywords before the set could enter Weaver. However, Weavers outputs often lack clear directive necessary for impactful research. As such, the Revealing Framework utilizes another fine-tuned LLM named Sketcher in parallel to Weaver. Sketcher is responsible for providing an overarching purpose to the resulting Thesis by generating sentence-length research goal based on the given keywords. While Sketcher is trained to suggest broad and unbiased research goal, in application, it is supplied with the same refined Keyword Set as Weaver for scientific coherence. 6 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration Combining the research concept and the research goal, an untrained LLM generates final paragraphlong Thesis. The prompt used here was designed to avoid any bias towards specific academic fields or the research concept while retaining the insights and contributions originating from the preceding stages. Putting everything together, the Revealing Framework reliably reveals new knowledge in the form of Theses from the Keyword Sets proposed by Nuri. The Scaffolding Framework Figure 4: Schematic of the Scaffolding Framework. The Scaffolding Framework assembles Statements from their unstructured counterparts, notably supplementing them with validated evidence. This framework employs logic graphs for its core mechanism. Pieces of informationsuch as key concepts, supporting evidence, and intermediate conclusions comprise typed vertices; relationships between these pieces form directed edges, constituting the logic graph. multiple-stage process built around this graph yields Statement with single concept and set of rationales, where the concept is 23-sentence-length summary of the Thesis, and each rationale is description that validates the concept. The need for structured format emerges because LLMs yield suboptimal results when repeatedly processing context-heavy natural language. While the Revealing Framework generates content rich in ideas, we observed that its irregular composition negatively impacts structural refinement and evaluation due to inherent biases. When reading paragraph, LLMs focus on connotations and nuances rather than the logical structure. This phenomenon exacerbates in multi-agent feedback loops where irrelevant preferences amass and ultimately diverge from the constructive criticism we desire. The Scaffolding Framework plays crucial role in avoiding these shortcomings. The first step in the Scaffolding Framework is the augmentation phase, where the Theses are challenged with counterarguments, each using peer-reviewed literature based on predefined criteria. The Theses are then augmented to account for the identified points while preserving the original approach. The following step is the graph iteration phase, where the paragraph is decomposed into logic graph. This phase iteratively reinforces the logic graph while verifying each revised graph against known facts. When the graph iteration is deemed complete, the logic graph is reconfigured into Statement in the final step. The central vertices map to the concept, and the surrounding nodes translate into the rationales. As such, the Scaffolding Framework rearranges the emergent idea from the Revealing Framework into Statements that are factual and logically sound. 7 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration The Assessment Framework The Assessment Framework is system that evaluates the validity of Statements generated by the Scaffolding Framework. Assessing scientific validity is inherently difficult; it depends on complex, contextspecific factors, and rigid evaluation criteria often impose substantial bias, making consistent judgments elusive. To mitigate this, the Assessment Framework is designed to evaluate Statements in two subsequent phases: exploratory analysis and specified inspection. In the exploratory analysis phase, reviewer LLM agent produces several critiques of given Statement. To avoid constraining the perspective of this agent, it is not provided with an explicit list of criteria. Rather, the LLM agent is instructed to generate an unconstrained number of critiques together from broader viewpoint, along with supporting rationales. These reviews are carried forward to the specified inspection phase, where meta-reviewer LLM agent evaluates them against predefined criteria, including practical feasibility, methodological rigor and fundamental scientific plausibility. Each critique is independently assessed on how severely the flaw undermines the Statements scientific integrity. By steering the exploratory analysis clear of contextual biases, we can ensure that the evaluation correctly reflects the overall context and remains unbiased by specific criteria. Following the process above, Statements that clear all initial critiques without substantial issues are determined to be scientifically sound and technologically feasible. In human-expert evaluations, the Assessment Framework achieved an 88.2% recall, highlighting its ability to detect latent flaws in superficially plausible yet scientifically unsound Statements. In this way, it ensures that the Statements from the Scaffolding Framework remain not only innovative but also firmly grounded in scientific reality, thus enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the research outputs. Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration 3. Results In this section, we showcase the Statements generated by Spacer. Each output follows structured format, consisting of the core concept, supporting rationales, and references. For illustration, we present three examples with brief explanations and comments. The explanations are based solely on the raw outputs with only minimal background information provided for clarity. These examples demonstrate Spacers capability for scientific discovery. Through deliberate decontextualization and sophisticated reasoning, Spacer synthesizes interdisciplinary concepts from Keyword Set while preserving scientific rigor. This highlights Spacers potential to provide scientific inspirations not limited to simple extensions of the current art. Further examples are available in our Github repository."

Some supporting DOIs are omitted for brevity. Figure 6: Hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibit disrupted calcium oscillations. Controlled noise injection as extracellular calcium fluctuation could restore oscillatory coherence toward normal state, suppressing malignant phenotype. Calcium ions are essential mediators in various cellular signaling pathways. In particular, calcium oscillations are integral to cellular processes including the regulation of cell cycle progression and NFAT activation [3234]. In malignant hepatocytes, calcium signaling undergoes extensive dysregulation in which calcium oscillations become impaired and cell cycle checkpoints are compromised [35, 36]. Spacer proposes to suppress malignant phenotypes of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by restoring calcium oscillatory coherence with stochastic resonance. Stochastic resonance is phenomenon in nonlinear systems where the addition of an appropriate level of noise can enhance oscillatory coherence [37]. When applied to calcium signaling, controlled noise injection could potentially restore the temporal coherence of disrupted oscillations [3840]. Such noise can be introduced through methods like 10 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration extracellular calcium concentration modulation or microfluidic technologies [4143]. Restoring calcium oscillation coherence could in turn recover normal calcium-dependent checkpoint regulation, thereby suppressing malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, this approach could be extended to selective targeting based on the differential sensitivity of cancer cells to calcium perturbation [44, 45]. This example suggests therapeutic approach of applying stochastic resonance, which has not been well-established in cancer treatment. The integration of calcium dynamics, nonlinear systems theory, and cellular oncology demonstrates the capability of connecting disparate domains."

Some supporting DOIs are omitted for brevity. 11 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration Figure 8: ATP is distributed across diverse metabolic pathways. Quantifying the allocation may enable prediction of cellular state transitions. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an universal energy currency in cells. The flow of ATP through metabolic pathways is dynamically regulated based on functional priorities and energy demands. Thus, ATP distribution patterns can provide predictive information about cells current state and potential transitions [46]. Spacer suggests framework for the prediction of cellular state transitions based on quantifying ATP allocations. Changes in energy deployment can be tracked through multiple experimental approaches, including fluxomics, metabolomics, and live-cell imaging techniques [4750]. These methods provide the temporal resolution and quantitative precision needed to monitor dynamic metabolic shifts in real-time. This framework presents new perspective in cell state modeling that contributes to both conventional cell biology and cutting-edge research areas. Recent advances in single-cell foundation models and their extension toward virtual cells have largely centered on single cell expression modalities such as scRNA-seq and CITE-seq, which predominantly provide static snapshots [5154]. By incorporating ATP allocation patterns, these approaches can encode mechanistic energy budgets alongside molecular features. Such an intergration of energy landscape with molecular data may extend the application from static depiction to dynamic cell state trajectory prediction. 12 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration"

Some supporting DOIs are omitted for brevity. Olfactory receptors are widely recognized for their role in odor detection within the nasal epithelium. They are also naturally expressed in the intestinal epithelium, where they function as chemosensors for bacterial metabolites [5557]. These receptors may influence NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to cascades that trigger NF-κB mediated antimicrobial pepdite (AMP) secretion [5860]. This creates an autonomous, metabolite-responsive defense system that operates in real-time based on local micro13 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration Figure 10: Intestinal epithelial cells can be engineered to overexpress olfactory receptors. This may lead to localized antimicrobial peptide secretion, enhancing intestinal microbial regulation. bial activity. Spacer argues for engineering intestinal epithelial cells to overexpress olfactory receptors, triggering AMP secretion in response to their stimulation. Combining adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors with cell-specific promoters enables the selective delivery of transgenes to the intestinal epithelium [6163]. The proposed concept introduces therapeutic approach that connects intestinal olfactory receptors to the regulation of AMP secretion. Built upon well characterized individual components, such as intestinal olfactory receptors and AMP secretion, their integration into spatially confined, metaboliteresponsive immune circuit has not yet been explored. This strategy could enable spatially restricted immune modulation to preserve beneficial commensal communities and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance emergence. 14 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration 4. Validations In validation, we examined three core parts of our work: (a) Nuris effectiveness at generating Keyword Sets resembling those of high-impact papers (Section 4.1), (b) Weavers capability to find concepts in Keyword Sets (Section 4.2), and (c) Spacers end-to-end performance in comparison to experts and state-of-the-art LLMs (Section 4.3). As Nuris core approach is to search for sets with an estimated high impact, the validation of (a) focuses primarily on the accuracy of its estimator. The remaining two validations merits further discussion. Given that both (b) and (c) require quality assessment of Statements, one might be tempted to directly score each samples quality with LLM or expert human judges, as done in [6466]. However, expert judge scores suffer from high variance arising from personal differences. Judgements from LLMs, on the other hand, are easily confounded by contextual and stylistic clues (Section 2.2), and suffer from bias to prefer LLM outputs [67]. Certainly, these issues can and should be mitigated by normalizing the data, but we argue that the approach is fundamentally misguided. The value of research ideas ultimately comes from the results of their execution; being able to reliably estimate their result would mean the idea is already obvious and thus useless. It is unsurprising, then, that any priori evaluation of research ideas will suffer from inherent variance and bias. We propose to sidestep this problem entirely by using existing high-quality published human research. Since the theses of these papers are then verified to yield high-impact results, we can use semantic similarity to measure the performance of systems aiming to create research ideas. Even with this approach, data must be compared in the same form and style, with content irrelevant to the evaluation removed. Since we aim to only evaluate ideas, we redacted the experimental results from abstracts of existing research papers, while converting Spacers Statements from their structured JSON form into prose. We call the resulting paragraph containing the core hypothesis thesis paragraph."

To evaluate the explanatory power of 𝑓() , we prepare validation set ℙ with 180,000 papers in peer-reviewed biology journals.

We therefore write ℙ< 𝑝 for the subset of all papers published before the paper 𝑝.

For comparison of the distributions, we plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of EVAL( 𝑝) and FWCI( 𝑝) by calculating the sensitivity and 1-specificity for varying thresholds. The results of the classification task are plotted in Figure 12, which demonstrates that 𝑓() effectively (FWCI +1) distinguishes between high and low impact papers. We also examined the distribution of log2 values for set of 10,000 randomly sampled papers across different EVAL( 𝑝) thresholds (Figure 13). Notably, higher EVAL( 𝑝) thresholds lead to substantial increase in the proportion of papers with very high citation impact.

As Nuri was designed to search for sets with high 𝑓ℙ values, the accuracy of 𝑓() directly translates into potential of the resulting Keyword Sets. Thus, our experiments serve as strong evidence of Nuri being able to create Keyword Sets carrying the necessary initiative to direct the next stages of our pipeline to meaningful research. 16 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration Figure 14: ROC curve of the function EVAL for predicting whether the Keyword Set is extracted from paper or is randomly selected.

            "content": "As discussed in Section 4, instead of scoring Weavers outputs on Nuri-generated Keyword Sets, we test whether it can reconstruct the research thesis of existing papers given an extracted Keyword Set. To preclude the possibility that the base model already has knowledge of the papers, we randomly chose 158 abstracts of papers published in acclaimed scientific journals including Science and Nature after May 1st, 2025. We then converted these abstracts into thesis paragraphs, and extracted Keyword Sets. These sets were then processed through Weaver, in place of the Nuri-generated Keyword Sets, to create the reconstructed thesis paragraph for comparison. Table 2 presents side-by-side comparisons of original theses and those reconstructed by Weaver. Across all examples, Weaver precisely recovers the original ideas, in particular preserving the logical structure and domain-specific subtleties. For quantitative comparison, we implemented test comparing the original ideas and Weaver reconstructions using o3. We judged the similarity of the two inputs in five aspects: logic, topic, objective, approach, and an overall decision. Each of the five prompts used are available in Appendix A5. We summarize the results in Table 1, which show that reconstructed paragraphs consistently pass at rate of over 85% across all journals used. To view all 158 papers and their original & reconstructed thesis paragraphs, refer to our Github repository. Table 1: Pass rates of reconstructed theses based on similarity to the original theses.

            "content": "We next evaluate the end-to-end performance of Spacer by comparing its theses against initial ideations of existing research papers and outputs from existing SOTA LLMs. To get representative sample of high-quality human research without data contamination, we selected the abstracts of papers published in Nature, Science, Cell, Nature Methods, and Neuron between June 1st, 2025 and July 16th, 2025, all outside the knowledge cutoff of Spacer and its training data. These abstracts were then converted into thesis paragraphs as in the beginning of Section 4. For comparison, we prompted GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek-R1-0528, and Grok 4 to create paragraph describing an innovative research idea. We randomly sampled 52 thesis paragraphs from each of the 7 classes (Spacer, published papers, and 5 LLMs in total), resulting in total of 364 theses analyzed. To compare these classes easily, we chose to analyze text embeddings of the resulting thesis paragraphs. The model used for embedding was Qwen3-Embedding-8B [71], chosen for its strong performance on text embedding tasks. Since textual embeddings include information about style [72], we further normalized stylistic properties in each thesis paragraph with Claude Sonnet 4 and Kimi K2 before embedding. These two preprocessing LLMs were deliberately chosen to be distinct from the LLMs to ensure neutrality. The full prompts used to generate and process these paragraphs, as well as the paragraphs themselves, can be found in Appendix A4 and our Github Repository. We first applied principal component analysis (PCA) on the entire set of 364 vectors, and visualized each of the 6 generated classes alongside the published papers in Figure 16. Our plots clearly show Spacers outputs are the closest to the published samples. Although LLMs are also capable of generating outputs that are close, they display high variance, with many samples semantically distant from the human ones. This result is consistent across the two processing models used. We next performed an linear discriminant analysis (LDA), with an initial PCA step to compress inputs into 128-dimensional vectors. The results were projected onto the first two axes and then plotted in Figure 15. We observe that LLM proposals are largely discriminated from published papers, while Spacer outputs overlap closely. Again, the results are consistent between the processing models, demonstrating that theses from Spacer are much more semantically aligned with those of expert research than those from any other SOTA LLM. Figure 15: LDA results of 364 research theses from Spacer, 5 SOTA LLMs, and ideations of published papers. Full embeddings were reduced to 128-dimensional vectors with PCA before the LDA step. Processing models used are (a) Claude Sonnet 4. (b) Kimi K2. Figure 17 shows the energy distances between the full vectors of each class, given by the formula below: ˆ𝐷𝐸 (𝑋, 𝑌 ) = 2 𝑚𝑛 (cid:13) (cid:13)𝑥𝑖 𝑦 𝑗 (cid:13) (cid:13)2 1 𝑚2 𝑥𝑖 𝑥𝑘 1 𝑛 2 (cid:13) (cid:13)𝑦 𝑗 𝑦𝑙 (cid:13) (cid:13)2 (3) 𝑛 𝑛 𝑗=1 𝑙=1 𝑚 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑗= 𝑚 𝑚 𝑖=1 𝑘=1 19 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration Figure 16: PCA results of 364 research theses from Spacer, 5 SOTA LLMs, and ideations of published papers.

Distances were computed with full embedding vectors. Processing models used are (a) Claude Sonnet 4. (b) Kimi K2. We did not use KL-divergence between each class since we could not perform normality test on the classes (each vector was 4096-dimensional while we only had 52 samples for each class). This quantitative analysis again shows Spacer is the closest class to the published papers; in fact, they have the smallest distance out of all pairs in our sample. Overall, Spacer is significantly closer to top human research than SOTA LLMs, regardless of the choice of metric. This analysis suggests that our architectural modifications are key augmentation without which current LLMs cannot reliably generate research concepts at the expert level. Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration 5. Discussion In this report, we have introduced Spacer. Spacer is the first framework to acknowledge the creative limitations of AI models stemming from their reliance on training data and thus adopt an alternate approachdeliberate decontextualization. This approach, not relying on serendipity, is closely aligned to our ultimate goal of achieving engineered scientific inspiration. We take Keyword Sets as our central medium, and postulate that new concepts can be discovered by searching for connections in them. With this postulate, we generate reasonable yet novel Keyword Sets with Nuri and guide LLM-based frameworks to explore their internal links. Our experiments on reconstructing past research ideas from Keyword Sets have demonstrated that research inspirations indeed lie within these sets. Moreover, we find Spacer to be more semantically aligned with human research than those from other SOTA LLMs, further confirming our core thesis. Why does inspiration matter? For most of history, humanity has regarded itself as the only entity capable of conceiving new ideas and realizing them. The rise of AI has eroded many similar beliefs about human uniqueness, and we believe that the next step for AI will be to push the limits in humanitys pursuit of scientific discovery. However, we remain skeptical of current LLM-based approaches, and more generally, of approaches relying solely on generative models based on pretraining and prompting. Such approaches model human inspirations primarily through randomness, which may result in modecollapsed ideas. From this perspective, Spacer is the closest system to automating the expansion of humanitys knowledge. complete shift to such paradigm would empower humanity to advance civilization at an unprecedented speed, and Spacer is our first step in this direction. Cost. Currently, Spacer costs less than $3 to generate single Statement. Compared to the expected value of potentially significant discovery, this is an attractive cost. Most of the cost of the Spacer pipeline comes from LLM inference; the cost of generating Keyword Set from Nuri is effectively zero, giving room to enhance Nuri with more compute. As Spacer is agnostic to the transformer architecture that powers most current LLMs, more efficient language modeling techniques can be directly integrated into our pipeline, whether they are further extensions of transformers or more fundamental innovations. Limitations. Human inspiration has no single source: inspection of extensive data, experience in different field [73], and daydreams [74] all have provided the spark for monumental discoveries. Thus, we cannot assert that deliberate decontextualization and search in Keyword Sets is the single most suitable, or the most human-like, way to synthesize scientific inspiration. We are much more confident in our works optimality for LLM-driven methods; beyond this paradigm, other approaches may prove equally or more effective. Even within the LLM-driven space, Spacer can be augmented in several different ways. Improvements in the base models, as well as reinforcement learning approaches to fine-tune each component, will enhance Spacers performance. On more fundamental level, we conjecture that non-autoregressive language models will have greater capacity for creative thought. Future Directions. Not all scientific inspirations bear fruit; experiments must be designed and performed to validate their hypotheses before they can become new knowledge or be applied to engineering. Therefore, this materialization step is hard requirement for any attempt at full automation of the human scientific process. In the future, we will extend Spacer to further flesh out its accepted Statement into an executable research plan, preferably by in-silico experiments. As preliminary experiment, we examined the abilities of current LLMs to perform this concretization. 22 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration For this task, we chose Grok 4 for its PhD-level capabilities [75], and instructed it to formulate validation plan based on the Statements generated by Spacer. The proposed plan contained all information necessary to conduct the research and only required minor revisions before immediate implementation. The complete outputs are provided in Appendix B. This result demonstrates that automated knowledge expansion through Spacer is already within reach. This will be our next step: developing an end-to-end pipeline that carries out the entire research process without any human intervention. We plan to apply robotics and in silico tools to conduct the proposed experiments automatically, while also devising more sophisticated methods for research plan construction. Although this work is focused mainly on biological research, there are no obstructions to implementing Spacer in any field of science, or indeed, any field where human inspiration is of importance. In fact, we expect Spacers approach to be most useful in fields where the impacts of ideas are heavy-tailed i.e., where creative breakthroughs have an outsized effect. Straightforward future extensions include physics, machine learning, and economics. However, Spacer need not be constrained to single domain; ultimately, Nuris graph could be unified to explore arbitrary areas of science, finding truly deep, creative, and interconnected scientific concepts. Conclusion. Spacer is scientific discovery system that automates academic research by capturing the essence of humanitys inspiration in science. We have overcome the creative limitations of LLMs by using Nuri to search for unexplored connections between decontextualized informationkeywords. Through this critical augmentation, Spacer has emergently conceived original concepts, something long thought possible only for humans. Researchers are now actively pursuing the creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI), system capable of surpassing human knowledge and creativity. Contributing to this ambition, Spacer has demonstrated the potential to engineer scientific inspiration. With further refinement and scaffolding tailored to biology, it has come tantalizingly close to actual scientific progress. As we advance towards automating the expansion of knowledge, we believe our work marks pivotal step forward in this collective journey. 23 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration 6.

This choice minimized the risk of runtime errors and ensured that our code is robust and maintainable. We also built custom framework that implements agentic AI in Rust, as existing solutions did not meet our needs. Multiple tasks we encountered during the research consist of several subtasks. While each subtask was well-defined, it could yield different numbers of outputs depending on the input. This variation caused complications when applying traditional approaches for handling multi-step process. As such, we developed an incremental scheduling framework to maximize the parallelism between subtasks. Another task that played crucial role throughout the various steps of Spacer was retrieving relevant articles to feed into the LLM. To address this, we created search database for scientific paper abstracts using data acquired from OpenAlex [76]. The database utilizes custom filters and LLM-based postprocessing to produce the most accurate search results."

The rationale is based on observed disruptions in calcium homeostasis and oscillations in HCC cells compared to normal hepatocytes, with noise injection potentially enhancing signal coherence to suppress malignant proliferation selectively. ## STEP 1: Characterize Baseline Calcium Oscillation Patterns in Normal and HCC Hepatocytes ### Approach **Rationale:** Establishing baseline differences in calcium signaling dynamics between normal and HCC cells is essential to confirm the hypothesis foundation, as disrupted oscillations in cancer cells are prerequisite for testing restoration via noise. This step uses live-cell imaging, feasible and established technique, to quantify oscillation frequency, amplitude, and coherence, addressing whether HCC cells exhibit less coherent patterns than normal cells. **Procedure:** C, 5% CO2 for 24h. 1. Seed primary human hepatocytes (normal) and HepG2 HCC cells at 5x104 cells/well in 96-well plates coated with collagen I, culture in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 2. Load cells with 5𝜇M Fluo-4 AM calcium indicator dye for 30min at 37 (1.25mM CaCl2). 3. Perform live-cell confocal microscopy using spinning-disk confocal system at 37 acquiring images every 5s for 30min to capture spontaneous oscillations. 4. Stimulate with 100nM ATP to induce oscillations if spontaneous activity is low. 5. Analyze traces using ImageJ: quantify oscillation frequency (peaks/min), amplitude (fold-change from baseline), and coherence (autocorrelation function decay time constant, tau; lower tau indicates less coherence). 6. Include negative control (dye only, no cells) and positive control (ionomycin 1𝜇M for maximal calcium response). Replicate in 3 independent experiments, n=50 cells/group per experiment, analyze with unpaired t-tests (p<0.05 significance). C, wash twice with HBSS C, **Required Resources:** - Cell lines/models: Primary human hepatocytes (e.g., from Lonza) for normal physiology; HepG2 cells (ATCC) as HCC model, chosen for their well-characterized calcium dysregulation. - Key reagents: Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen, 5𝜇M); ATP (Sigma, 100nM); Ionomycin (Sigma, 1𝜇M); HBSS with 1.25mM CaCl2. - Equipment: Spinning-disk confocal microscope (e.g., PerkinElmer UltraVIEW); 96-well plates; ImageJ software for analysis. ### Expected Outcomes - Normal hepatocytes show coherent oscillations (tau >10min, frequency 0.1-0.5Hz, amplitude 2-5 fold). - HCC cells show disrupted patterns (tau <5min, irregular frequency, sustained high baseline). - No differences between cell types (null result). - Technical artifacts (e.g., photobleaching leading to apparent low coherence). 44 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration ### Most Probable Outcome HCC cells exhibit disrupted oscillations with lower coherence (tau 2-4min) and higher baseline calcium compared to normal hepatocytes (tau 15min), based on established literature showing altered calcium homeostasis in cancer cells due to pump dysregulation; however, complete absence of oscillations is unlikely, as HCC cells retain some responsiveness, potentially yielding partial differences rather than stark contrasts. ### BRANCH 1.1: Validate Calcium Dysregulation Mechanisms **Trigger:** Confirmation of disrupted oscillations in HCC cells (lower tau and irregular patterns). **Approach:** Assess expression and function of key calcium regulators. 1. Perform qRT-PCR on RNA from both cell types using primers for PMCA1/4 (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase), TRPV channels, and housekeeping gene GAPDH; normalize to normal cells. 2. Western blot for PMCA proteins using anti-PMCA antibodies (Abcam, 1:1000 dilution, with beta-actin loading control). 3. Functional assay: Treat cells with PMCA inhibitor carboxyeosin (10 𝜇M) and repeat calcium imaging to confirm exacerbation of dysregulation. 4. Analyze with ANOVA, n=3 replicates. **Resources:** qRT-PCR kit (Qiagen); anti-PMCA antibodies (Abcam); carboxyeosin (Sigma, 10 𝜇M ); immunoblotting system. **Expected Outcomes:** Lower PMCA expression/function in HCC; no differences; unexpected upregulation. **Most Probable:** Modest downregulation of PMCA in HCC (50% reduction), consistent with known cancer adaptations for sustained signaling, but not complete loss, as cells maintain viability. ## STEP 2: Implement Controlled Noise Injection and Assess Oscillation Coherence Restoration ### Approach **Rationale:** This core step tests the stochastic resonance hypothesis by introducing non-Gaussian noise via microfluidic modulation of extracellular calcium, measuring if it enhances coherence in HCC cells without affecting normal cells, using established microfluidic and imaging techniques for precise control and quantification. **Procedure:** 1. Fabricate microfluidic device with perfusion channels (e.g., using soft lithography with PDMS) for rapid switching between solutions. 2. Seed HepG2 and normal hepatocytes in device chambers, load with Fluo-4 AM as in Step 1. 3. Perfuse with HBSS at 1.25mM CaCl2 baseline, then apply aperiodic modulation: switch to 0.8mM CaCl2 for pulse durations of 1-5s at frequencies 0.05-1Hz, using Poisson-distributed intervals for non-Gaussian noise (controlled via syringe pump with LabVIEW software); total exposure 30min. 4. Image simultaneously with confocal microscopy, acquiring every 5s. 5. Analyze coherence (tau from autocorrelation) preand post-modulation; compare to constant 1.25mM control and Gaussian noise control (regular pulses). 6. Replicate n=3 experiments, 30 cells/group, use paired t-tests. **Required Resources:** - Cell lines/models: Same as Step 1, for direct comparison. - Key reagents: Fluo-4 AM; HBSS with varying CaCl2 (0.8-1.25mM). - Equipment: Microfluidic fabrication setup (PDMS, Sylgard); syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus); Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration LabVIEW for modulation; confocal microscope. ### Expected Outcomes - Increased coherence in HCC cells (tau doubles to 8-10min). - No change or decreased coherence. - Selective effect on HCC vs. normal cells. - Cytotoxicity at higher modulation intensities. ### Most Probable Outcome Partial restoration of coherence in HCC cells (tau increases by 20-50%, but not to normal levels), as biological systems often show incomplete stochastic resonance due to cellular heterogeneity and suboptimal noise parameters; normal cells likely unaffected or slightly disrupted, based on known robustness of healthy signaling. ### BRANCH 2.1: Optimize Noise Parameters **Trigger:** Partial or no coherence restoration. **Approach:** Systematically vary modulation parameters. 1. Test ranges: frequencies 0.01-2Hz, amplitudes 0.5-1.5mM CaCl2, durations 0.5-10s, in factorial design. 2. Repeat imaging and analysis, fit data to resonance curve (coherence vs. noise intensity). 3. n=3 replicates. **Resources:** Additional HBSS formulations; curve-fitting software (GraphPad Prism). **Expected Outcomes:** Optimal parameters identified; no optimum found; resonance in normal cells too. **Most Probable:** Identification of modest optimum (e.g., 0.1Hz, 2s pulses) with partial enhancement, as full resonance is rare in heterogeneous cell populations per biophysical precedents. ### BRANCH 2.2: Measure Downstream Signaling Activation **Trigger:** Successful coherence restoration (increased tau >20%). **Approach:** Assess NF 𝜅B and NFAT activation. 1. Post-modulation, fix cells and immunostain with anti-p65 (NF 𝜅B, Cell Signaling, 1:200) and anti-NFAT (Abcam, 1:100), quantify nuclear translocation via confocal imaging (n=100 cells/group). 2. qRT-PCR for downstream targets p21 and cyclin D. 3. Controls: TNF𝛼 (10ng/ml) for NF 𝜅B positive control. **Resources:** Antibodies as specified; qRT-PCR kit; TNF𝛼 (Sigma). **Expected Outcomes:** Increased p21, decreased cyclin D; no change; paradoxical activation. **Most Probable:** Mild increase in p21 (1.5-fold) but inconsistent cyclin changes, reflecting partial signaling restoration amid cancer cell adaptations. ## STEP 3: Evaluate Cell Cycle Checkpoint Regulation and Proliferation Effects ### Approach **Rationale:** This functional validation assesses if restored calcium coherence translates to re-engaged checkpoints and reduced proliferation in HCC cells, using flow cytometry and proliferation assays as standard, feasible methods to link signaling to phenotypic outcomes. **Procedure:** 46 Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration 1. Subject HepG2 and normal cells to optimized noise modulation (from Step 2) for 24h in microfluidic setup. 2. Harvest, stain with propidium iodide (50𝜇g/ml) for cell cycle analysis via flow cytometry (FACSCalibur), quantify G1/S/G2 fractions. 3. Parallel MTT assay (0.5mg/ml, 4h incubation) for proliferation, read absorbance at 570nm. 4. Include controls: no modulation, constant low calcium (0.8mM), and doxorubicin (1𝜇M) as positive antiproliferative control. 5. n=3 experiments, analyze with ANOVA. **Required Resources:** - Cell lines/models: Same as previous, for consistency. - Key reagents: Propidium iodide (Sigma, 50𝜇g/ml); MTT kit (Promega); Doxorubicin (Sigma, 1𝜇M). - Equipment: Flow cytometer (BD FACSCalibur); spectrophotometer. ### Expected Outcomes - G1 arrest and reduced proliferation in HCC cells. - No effect on cell cycle or proliferation. - Selective effect on HCC vs. normal. - Induction of apoptosis. ### Most Probable Outcome Modest G1 accumulation (10-20% increase) and proliferation reduction (30%) in HCC cells, but not complete arrest, as cancer cells often resist checkpoint restoration due to multiple mutations; normal cells unaffected, consistent with selective vulnerability. ## INTEGRATION STRATEGY Step 1 provides baseline data essential for interpreting Step 2 and 3. Positive outcomes from Step 2 (coherence restoration) feed into Step 3 for functional validation, while branches allow mechanistic refinement. Together, they build evidence from characterization to mechanism to phenotype, with cross-validation (e.g., using same cell models and imaging across steps). ## CRITICAL DECISION POINTS - If Step 1 shows no baseline differences, abandon hypothesis (no disruption to restore). - If Step 2 fails to restore coherence even after optimization (Branch 2.1), conclude against stochastic resonance in this system. - If Step 3 shows no proliferation effect despite signaling changes (Branch 2.2), hypothesis partially refuted (mechanism present but functionally irrelevant). ## SUCCESS CRITERIA Hypothesis validated if: (1) Baseline disruption confirmed (tau <50% of normal); (2) Noise increases tau >50% in HCC selectively; (3) >20% G1 arrest and >40% proliferation reduction in HCC, with statistical significance (p<0.01) and controls validated. ## CONTINGENCY PLANS If microfluidic modulation fails (e.g., cell detachment), switch to bulk perfusion in multiwell plates with manual media changes. If HepG2 lacks robust oscillations, substitute with Huh7 HCC line. For low signal-to-noise in imaging, use ratiometric dyes like Fura-2.

Substrate rheology governs the dynamic contact angle and provides mechanism for stick-slip motion, where the contact line depins and slides down the wetting ridge.
