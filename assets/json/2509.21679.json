            "content": "Peer review is an evaluation of academic work by experts to assess its originality, significance, and validity before publication (Kelly et al., 2014; Taylor & Francis, 2025). In AI conferences, as the number of submissions is exponentially increasing, required number of reviewers is also exploding. As result, review quality is degraded, which undermines the integrity and reliability of peer-review system (Stelmakh et al., 2021; Cortes & Lawrence, 2021; Shah, 2022; Kim et al., 2025). Due to the importance of the issue, previous works propose criteria for evaluating review quality. However, we observe trade-off between applicability to reviews and specificity of rubrics. Goldberg et al. (2025) and Du et al. (2024) proposes criteria that could apply to nearly every review but those are quite vague and subjective. Guo et al. (2023), Sadallah et al. (2025), Purkayastha et al. (2025), and Ou et al. (2025) introduce specific and objective criteria but those target narrow scope of reviews. If we could reliably measure review quality based on specific yet applicable criteria, we could filter out misinformed reviews or give feedback to reviewers before the reviews are released. To resolve this issue, we introduce two specific yet applicable criteria of review quality: unanswerability of questions and factuality of weaknesses. To select the criteria, we recruited group of 1We will make the source code and dataset publicly available."

We further categorize weakness into claim and argument by the presence of supporting reasons. Based on an appropriate knowledge base, if question is answerable by the paper, claim is factually incorrect, or an argument contains factually incorrect premises, then the review point is misinformed. For arguments, to extract all explicit and implicit premises, we also introduce an automatic argument reconstruction engine. human experts and let them independently analyze small subset of ICLR reviews2. Specifically, each of them decomposed review into review points, which are formally defined as follows. Definition 1 (Review Point). review point is single, self-contained unit of evaluation or inquiry in revieweither weakness or questionthat stands on its own semantically. Each human evaluated quality of review points, and they discussed trustworthy criteria to detect low-quality. Based on the discussion, we formally define misinformed review point as follows. Definition 2 (Misinformed Review Point). review point is misinformed if and only if question stated in review can be already answered by the paper, or weakness stated in review is incorrect or contains incorrect premises regarding the paper. In this work, the human annotation shows that 26.4% of questions and 15.2% of weaknesses are misinformed, which means that the current AI conference reviews contain considerable amount of misinformed review points.3 We also note that these criteria aligns with reviewer guidelines of major AI conferences. For instance, ACL 2023 Peer Review Policies indicate that before writing negative review, check whether your questions are already answered. (Boyd-Graber et al., 2023), and NeurIPS 2025 reviewer guidelines indicate that reviewers should minimize the chance of misunderstandings during the reviewing process (NeurIPS 2025 Program Chairs, 2025). Based on these observations, we define REVIEWSCORE that indicates if review point is misinformed (Section 3.1). First, we define BASE REVIEWSCORE by directly applying the definition of misinformed review points in 5-point scale. However, we discovered human-annotated factuality often diverges. This is because weakness often contains both correct and incorrect explicit premises or incorrect implicit premises, which hinders humans to reliably annotate factuality. To resolve this issue, we further define ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE as an aggregation of premise factuality scores. If weakness has no supporting reason, we call it as claim, and if weakness consists of more than one premises, we call it as an argument. We adopt two aggregation methods, logical conjunction, following the literature of logic (Beall et al., 2024), and weighted average, maintaining 5-point scale (Figure 1). Before evaluating ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE, we have to extract all explicit and implicit premises from an argument. This process is called argument reconstruction in logic and critical thinking (Brun & Betz, 2016; Groarke, 2024; Dowden, 2024), and we construct an engine that automatically does this process (Section 3.2). To fully automate misinformed review detection with LLMs, we should verify if model-estimated REVIEWSCORE align with human-annotated REVIEWSCORE. To do that, we construct human expert-annotated REVIEWSCORE dataset based on ICLR reviews (Section 3.3). We recruited 15 experienced graduate students and they dedicated total 244 hours for trustworthy human annotation. 2A group of three graduate students studying AI analyzed reviews of ICLR submissions available in OpenReview. Detailed process of this group work is described in Appendix B. 3A group of 15 graduate students annotate reviews of 40 works submitted to ICLR 2021-2023. Detailed process of this human annotation is described in Section 3.3."

We use eight current state-of-the-art models, including five proprietary and three open-sourced models, and confirm moderate agreements with the human experts. ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE clearly outperforms BASE REVIEWSCORE, which proves the effectiveness of premise-level factuality scoring. We also conduct thorough human-model disagreement analysis and observe that models sometimes misunderstand the meaning of review points or predict scores that minority human annotators give. To summarize our contributions: 1. We introduce REVIEWSCORE, novel evaluation criteria that detects misinformed review points (i.e., questions that can be answered by the paper or weaknesses with incorrect premises). 2. To evaluate the factuality of premises, we propose an automatic argument reconstruction engine that generates valid and faithful set of premises and conclusion. 3. We construct trustworthy human expert-annotated dataset to measure the reliability of automatic evaluation of REVIEWSCORE. 4. We validate the reliability of automatic REVIEWSCORE evaluation by using eight current stateof-the-art LLMs and conducting comprehensive human-model disagreement analysis."

            "content": "Peer review evaluation. Previous works studied how to evaluate the quality of peer reviews. Goldberg et al. (2025) introduces four criteria, understanding, substantiation, coverage, and constructiveness. However, they focus on evaluating review as whole, not each individual review point, which makes difficult to clarify which specific points are misinformed. They also do not use LLMs to automate evaluation. Guo et al. (2023) specifically focuses on evaluating substantiation. However, they evaluate whether each review point has supporting evidence, not whether the supporting pieces of evidence are factually correct, leaving it as future work. Our works factuality criteria exactly covers this part. Sadallah et al. (2025) proposes four criteria, actionability, grounding & specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. However, they only focus on evaluating weaknesses, excluding questions, and as in Guo et al. (2023), they only evaluate whether weaknesses are grounded and supported, not whether those are factually correct. Purkayastha et al. (2025) defines lazy thinking in the context of NLP paper reviews and introduces heuristic-based rubrics. However, their criteria is only applicable to NLP domain which is hard to be generalized into other domains. Argument evaluation. In logic and critical thinking, an argument is list of statements, one of which is the conclusion and the others are the premises (Dutilh Novaes, 2022; Lau & Chan, 2025). To evaluate an argument, we need to follow two steps. First, we have to identify and reconstruct the argument into set of premises and conclusion, which is called an argument reconstruction (Brun & Betz, 2016; Groarke, 2024; Dowden, 2024). Then, we evaluate whether each premise is factually correct. An argument reconstruction should both be valid, which means premises deductively imply conclusion, and faithful, which means premises and conclusion accurately and completely represents an original argument (Brun & Betz, 2016; Betz & Richardson, 2021). Previously, Betz & Richardson (2021) trains T5 model for argument reconstruction. However, the training datasets are either synthetic or polished and the reconstruction do not require any additional context information. In contrast, our work targets peer reviews, which include real-world unpolished arguments, and the reconstruction requires an entire paper to fully understand the context of arguments."

            "title": "3.1 DEFINITION",
            "content": "Our goal of defining REVIEWSCORE is to detect misinformed review points. Following this goal and the review quality criteria discussion in Section 1, we first define BASE REVIEWSCORE as factuality of weaknesses and unanswerability of questions. The following definition formally describes it. Definition 3 (BASE REVIEWSCORE). Let be review point (either weakness or question) about submitted paper S. Define FactualityS : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, UnanswerabilityS : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, where and are, respectively, the sets of weaknesses and questions appearing in review of S4. We considered score 12 as Misinformed and score 35 as Not misinformed for binary classification setup. The BASE REVIEWSCORE of is: ReviewScorebase(x) = (cid:40)WScore(x) = FactualityS(x), if (weakness), QScore(x) = UnanswerabilityS(x), if (question). However, during the group discussion in Section 1, we discovered that human annotators evaluations on factuality diverge if weakness contains both factual and nonfactual premises or nonfactual premise is implicitly presumed. It happens since the human annotators implicitly weigh the importance of underlying premises of weakness and then decide the final factuality score. To resolve this issue, we further define ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE. We categorize weaknesses into arguments and claims based on whether there are supporting reasons or not. We keep the definition of WScore to evaluate claims, but further develops finer-grained score to evaluate arguments. Following the literature of critical thinking (Brun & Betz, 2016; Groarke, 2024; Dowden, 2024), we reconstruct an argument into premise-conclusion structure and then define ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE for arguments as (an aggregation of) factuality of premises. The following definition formally describes it. Definition 4 (ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE). Let be review point about submitted paper S. Let C, A, and denote, respectively, the sets of claims, arguments, and questions in review of S. For A, let its (explicit and implicit) premises be P(x) = {p1, . . . , pk} with {p1, . . . , pk} for the conclusion of x. Let be the set of knowledge bases available for factuality judgments (i.e., S, annotator knowledge, referred papers), and let Factuality : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, := (cid:91) xA P(x), be 5-point scoring function for claims and premises given knowledge base. Define selector KB : that chooses the knowledge base used for each item (for claims C, KB(x) = S; for premises pi, KB(pi) = KBi K). For given KB(x) K, we notate the factuality function as FactualityKB(x)(). Agg is an operator that aggregates list of scores to single score. The ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE of is: ReviewScoreadv(x) = ClaimScore(x) = FactualityS(x), ArgScore(x) = Agg(cid:0)FactualityKBi(pi)piP(x) (cid:1) , if (claim), if (argument), QScore(x) = UnanswerabilityS(x), if (question). Aggregation methods. To aggregate premise factuality scores as single ArgScore, we introduce two aggregation methods: logical conjunction and weighted average. Following the literature of logic, an argument is true if and only if all premises are true. We define premise is true if and only if it has factuality score 35, and otherwise, it is false. We dubbed this aggregation as logical conjunction, which follows the binary classification setup. However, if an annotator mistakenly evaluates one of premises, then the error propagates to the entire argument. To alleviate this issue, we also aggregate by weighted average. Since it is difficult to measure the importance of premises, 4Detailed rubric is described in Appendix H."

            "title": "3.2 AUTOMATIC ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION",
            "content": "To evaluate ArgScore, we have to extract (explicit and implicit) premises P(x) from an argument A. Since human experts require significant amount of time and costs to do this, we automate it using LLMs. First, we check if model could directly reconstruct an argument by giving detailed instructions. To preserve the context of an argument, we also give the model submitted paper S. However, it mostly fails to generate valid and faithful reconstructions6. To resolve this issue, we add two feedback loops to ensure validity and faithfulness of an argument reconstruction (Figure 2a). An LLM alone often falls short in ensuring validity, so we include SAT solver which could automatically judges the validity of set of premises and conclusion without any logical errors. To do that, an LLM translates set of natural language (NL) premises and conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) formulas. Then, SAT solver decides whether the premises deductively implies the conclusion. If the reconstruction is valid, then an LLM translates formalized premises and conclusion back into NL domain. This process is called logical streamlining, which means to rephrase NL premises or conclusion in order to make their logico-semantic structure more transparent (Bowell & Kemp, 2014; Brun & Betz, 2016; Betz & Richardson, 2021). We then pass these streamlined NL premises and conclusion to the subsequent faithfulness feedback loop. However, if the reconstruction is invalid, then we feed rule-based reward signal to the argument reconstructor to regenerate the reconstruction. There are two types of reward signals, one is naive signal that says the formalized premises do not imply the conclusion, and the other one tells that the proof is circular. 5Since we reconstruct every argument as valid (i.e., set of premises deductively implies conclusion), there are often conditional premises that make an argument valid but are trivially true. Detailed rubric of untrivialness is described in Appendix H. 6Detailed numerical results and qualitative analysis are reported in Appendix C."

To ensure that, we prompt an LLM to judge whether the reconstruction is faithful or not and justify its decision. If the reconstruction is faithful, then we stop iterating the loop. If the reconstruction is unfaithful, then we feed LLM judges justification to the argument reconstructor to regenerate the reconstruction. To minimize model calls in practice, we connect these two loops in series so that only valid reconstructions are judged for their faithfulness. Also, we limit the total number of loop iteration to 10 and return the last reconstructed argument if the loop fails to generate valid and faithful reconstruction. We provide an example reconstruction in Figure 2b, and details on feedback loops and model prompts are described in Appendix and H, respectively. Quality of argument reconstruction. We measure validity and faithfulness of reconstructed arguments using SAT solver and human annotators, respectively. With claude-sonnet-3.7 as base LLM, every reconstruction is valid, and average faithfulness score is 4.5 / 5.

Our dataset contains total 657 annotated review points, consisting of 143 questions, 92 claims, and 422 arguments. Specifically, 1,748 premises of the arguments are manually annotated 7. Human-review matching. We recruit 15 graduate students studying AI as human annotators, and they annotate total 40 papers submitted to ICLR 202120238. Specifically, we first make five groups by their research interests. For each group, three human annotators discuss which papers to annotate and select eight papers that are relevant with all three. Then, each human annotates selected eight papers review points which are preprocessed from OpenReview. Data curation process. We collaboratively use an LLM and humans for REVIEWSCORE data curation, where an LLM preprocesses reviews and then humans annotate those. Given review, an LLM extracts independent review points. For each review point, an LLM automatically annotates the type (i.e., claim, argument, or question) and human verifies it. If the review point is question, then human scores if the question is (un)answerable by the paper in 5-point scale and justifies it if needed. If the review point is claim, then human scores if the claim is true in 5-point scale and justifies it if needed. If the review point is an argument, then human scores the arguments factuality same as in claims (i.e., BASE REVIEWSCORE). To annotate ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE for arguments, we first run automatic argument reconstruction engine (Section 3.2) to extract underlying premises of the argument. After that, human scores if the reconstruction is faithful in 5-point scale. If the faithfulness score is less than 4 (i.e., faithful, but one or two minor changes recommended), then they skip the subsequent annotations. Otherwise, they judge the factuality of premises. For each premise, they first select knowledge base (i.e., submitted paper, annotator knowledge, or referred papers), score if the premise is true based on the knowledge base in 5-point scale, and score if the premise is (un)trivial in 3-point scale. They justify any of three decisions if needed. Trustworthiness of human annotation. Three humans independently annotate reviews (i.e., we take median value as final human label), and they are allowed to use any related materials or tools (e.g., discussion between authors and reviewers in OpenReview, web search, etc.). We also provide annotators detailed guidelines and an hour-long online orientation session. Furthermore, we highly encourage them to communicate with us through group chat so that we could give them instant responses to their questions and share with all, which builds global consensus among human annotators. Thanks to these efforts, despite the difficulty of the work, we obtain median 0.301 and highest 0.428 inter-annotator agreement in Krippendorffs Alpha (Hughes, 2021) across different annotator groups. Detailed results are described in Appendix E. 7Details of the dataset construction and statistics are described in Appendix D. 8Since ICLR 20242025 submission drafts are not opened to public, we exclude these years."

To measure LLMs ability to automatically evaluate REVIEWSCORE, we perform experiments on eight current state-of-the-art LLMs that achieve significantly high alignments with humans. We include five proprietary models, claude-sonnet-3.7 (Anthropic, 2025a), claude-sonnet-4 (Anthropic, 2025b), gpt-4o (OpenAI, 2024), gpt-5 (OpenAI, 2025), and gemini-2.5-flash (Gemini Team, Google, 2025), and three open-sourced models, qwen3-235b-a22b (Yang et al., 2025), deepseek-v3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), and llama-3.3 (AI@Meta, 2024)9.

We exclude reasoning models as LLM judges since REVIEWSCORE mostly depends on grounding and evidence, not longer or smarter chains of thought. Evaluation metrics. We use different sets of metrics for two types of problem formulations, binary classification and 5-point scale scoring. For the binary classification, since majority of humanannotated labels are Not misinformed, we mainly use F1 score which is robust to class imbalance. For the 5-point scale scoring, since majority of human-annotated scores are 4 and 5, we mainly use Quadratic Weighted Kappa (Warrens, 2012), variant of Cohens Kappa (Cohen, 1960), that is robust to the skewed data distribution. Hereinafter, we call this metric Kappa for simplicity. To provide more comprehensive results, we additionally use Precision and Recall for the binary classification and Pearson rank correlation and Gwets AC2 (Gwet, 2001) for the 5-point scale scoring."

Comparison of disagreement types of claude-sonnet-3.7 and claude-sonnet-4. (a) Types of human-model disagreements. (b) types of review points. Regardless of the models, questions show the highest agreement, arguments follow subsequently, and claims show the lowest agreement. Specifically, for claims, some models show zero F1 score or negative Kappa score. We analyze human-model disagreements thoroughly in Section 4.4 and conclude that since claims lack supporting evidence and are often value-laden, models often misinterpret the intended meaning of the claims or judge differently than humans. For proprietary models, claude-sonnet-3.7 shows the highest human-model agreements types of review points. One thing to note is claude-sonnet-4 conacross different sistently shows lower agreement its because than its preceding model. We find out claude-sonnet-4 sometimes overthink and more frequently predicts the minority humanannotated scores than claude-sonnet-3.7 does. In contrast, comparing F1 scores of gpt-4o and gpt-5, the advanced model shows higher agreement than the preceding model. that For open-sourced models, qwen3-235b-a22b shows best human-model agreements in terms of F1 score. Open-sourced models show lower human-model agreements than proprietary models, but the gap is not significant. Open-sourced models sometimes show better agreements than proprietary models, for instance, llama-3.3 outperforms claude-sonnet-4 on REVIEWSCORE evaluation. However, open-sourced models consistently show lower agreements on evaluating ArgScore. More results and qualitative analysis of model evaluation are described in Appendix F."

Since the only difference is in defining scores for arguments, we compare REVIEWSCORE for arguments in Table 2. To verify the effectiveness of aggregation methods, we additionally include ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE for arguments without aggregation (i.e., factuality of premises). Regardless of models, ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE clearly shows higher agreements than BASE REVIEWSCORE. For claude-sonnet-3.7, ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE performs 2.48 higher F1 score and 2.48 higher Kappa score than the BASE REVIEWSCORE. The aggregation methods also contribute to higher agreements. For claude-sonnet-3.7, ADVANCED REVIEWSCORE performs 1.75 higher F1 score and 1.36 higher Kappa score than the one without aggregation."

            "content": "REVIEWSCORE Distribution. We present model-estimated REVIEWSCORE distribution and compare with humanannotated ones. Specifically, following the binary classification setup, we report the proportion of misinformed review points in Table 3. There is clear trend that models more frequently decide review points as Misinformed than humans. Models decide 31.2% of reviews points as Misinformed in average, where humans decide only 17.8% as Misinformed. The discrepancy is the largest in claims where models decide 22.8% as Misinformed and humans decide only 5.9% as Misinformed. To understand these results more deeply, we continue our analysis on the following human-model disagreements. Proportion of misinTable 3: formed review points estimated by models and humans. Model Human Claims Arguments Questions Review points 22.8 30.1 40. 31.2 5.9 17.7 26.4 17.8 Human-model disagreements. We analyze types of human-model disagreements in Figure 3a. Across all review points, there are two common types of disagreements, which are models misunderstand or incorrectly reason and models predict scores that are minority of human-annotated scores. These two types comprise nearly all disagreements on arguments and questions, and about half of disagreements on claims. For claims, we observe that 36% of disagreements are caused by either claims are value-laden or lack supporting reason. These make the factuality judgment of claims subjective, leading to low human-model agreement. Practical limitations such as incorrect pdf parsing and not providing appendix to models cause nontrivial portion of disagreements. We also analyze the reason why claude-sonnet-3.7 shows higher human-model agreements than claude-sonnet-4 in Figure 3b. The advanced model shows smaller number of misunderstanding or incorrect reasoning, however, it shows higher number of overthinking10 and minority human-annotated score predictions, leading to lower human-model agreement. Helpfulness of authors response. We study whether providing authors responses of reviews to model benefits the automatic REVIEWSCORE evaluation using claude-sonnet-4 in Table 4. Providing authors response clearly shows higher human-model agreement than not providing it. Specifically, the agreement of REVIEWSCORE increases by 22.3% in F1 score and 13.2% in Kappa score by incorporating authors response. Note that claude-sonnet-4 with authors response achieves the highest agreement compared to all models without authors response. Furthermore, the agreement of WScore and ArgScore without aggregation (i.e., premise factuality) also increases significantly by incorporating authors response. These observations show that authors response largely benefits detecting misinformed reviews by providing additional cues for model judgments."

            "content": "We acknowledge three types of limitations of our work. First, there are technical and practical limitations in the automated REVIEWSCORE evaluation. Throughout Section 4, human-model agreement seems low even with authors response. However, compared to Du et al. (2024) which measures human-model agreement on Deficient review detection and reports the best F1 score as 0.220, our 10We judge model overthinks if its justification of score is significantly longer than another model. We also manually verify if model overanalyzes review point."

To save API calling costs, when the paper is given to LLMs, we only provide text and tables of the main paper, where any figure or appendix is excluded. We also observe nontrivial amount of incorrect pdf parsing. Second, there are technical limitations in the automatic argument reconstruction. The reconstruction output is not always perfect since it depends on the capability of the base model. However, we observe considerable output quality improvement when we upgrade the base model to claude-sonnet-4, indicating that the reconstruction engine would perform better as the model improves in general. Lastly, there are practical limitations in the dataset construction. Since human annotators are graduate students with varying skillfulness and the annotation requires significant amount of cognitive load, there are unavoidable noise in human annotation. Furthermore, manual selection of papers by human annotators might introduce any kind of unintended biases. However, to collect the most reliable annotation under our limited budget, we inevitably choose this method."

To automate REVIEWSCORE evaluation using LLMs and validate it, we also construct trustworthy human-annotated dataset. The results show moderate human-model agreement, and further comprehensive disagreement analysis supports the potential of fully automated REVIEWSCORE evaluation with current state-of-the-art LLMs. We hope our work could contribute to mitigate the issue of low-quality reviews in AI conferences."

For authors, by providing reconstruction of argumentative review points, it helps to understand or clarify the reviewers intention and to formulate rebuttal. For reviewers, by providing REVIEWSCORE of their review points, it allows them to verify the review quality by themselves and helps reviewers to better understand the paper. For metareviewers, by providing REVIEWSCORE of each reviewer, it could assist their final decisions. To summarize, it could serve as an automated system for managing the review quality."

            "content": "First, we recruit group of three graduate students studying AI and NLP and let them independently analyze reviews of ten common manually selected submitted papers from ICLR 2021202311. Specifically, we guided the group to: decompose review into several independent review points, evaluate quality of the review points by 5-point scale with their own criteria, and justify their scores that ends with meta-sentence that does not involve papers context which is used for our further analysis. During human evaluation, we minimize our effort to provide detailed guidelines to facilitate bias-free human analysis. Then, we categorize these justifications in order to find common features of low-quality review points. There are five common types: (1) questions that can be already addressed by the paper, (2) comments that reflect misunderstanding of the paper, (3) out-of-scope remarks, (4) observations pointing out minor details, and (5) unclear points. However, for the last three types, we observe that majority of review points are agreed or argued by single human annotator. In other words, given review point, only single human argues it is out-of-scope, whereas other two humans argue it is within scope and could be potential drawback of the submitted paper. Following this pattern, single human argues review point is addressing minor details but others argue it is major point, and single human argues review point is unclear whereas others do not agree with this. In contrast, the first two types of review points (i.e., answerable questions and misunderstood comments) are mostly agreed by two or more human annotators, indicating that these two types have more objective and trustworthy criteria for detecting low-quality reviews. Based on these observations, we focus on evaluating review points based on the first two criteria. Lastly, we share some meaningful insights from this group discussion that strongly motivates our work. Based on the analysis of score justifications, given review point, some (sub)sentences are high-quality or factually correct but others could be misinformed or factually incorrect. This later motivates our premise-level factuality evaluation (Section 3.1). Furthermore, during the group discussion, we observe that human annotators sometimes struggle which parts in review point they should weigh more to evaluate the review point. This later motivates our aggregation methods which include logical conjunction and weighted average by untrivialness (Section 3.1). We also discover that human evaluations are sometimes incorrect. We leave this as limitation of our work. However, to alleviate this issue, we recruit three human annotators for every instance and further ensure the annotation quality by providing them careful guidelines and actively communicating with them to build global consensus on the evaluation criteria (Section 3.3). 11Since those papers include papers written by authors of our work, we do not share the full list of target papers to keep anonymity. We will uncover the full list after the paper is published."

            "content": "We elaborate components of automatic argument reconstruction engine (Section 3.2, Figure 2) in the following. We also refer the corresponding prompt used in each step if it exists. 1. Given an argumentative review point, an LLM extracts verbatim conjecture and its verbatim reason statements (Figure 23). 2. Given verbatim conclusion and reasons of the argumentative review point and corresponding paper parsed from pdf file, an LLM reconstructs the argument into premise-conclusion structure. At the same inference, the model also translates (or formalizes) NL premises and conclusion into corresponding FOL formulas and generate keys which assign NL meaning to variables and predicates. To facilitate the model to generate valid formalization, the model generates deductive proof using formalized premises and conclusion at the end (Figure 24). 3. Given FOL premises and conclusion with keys and deductive proof, an LLM extracts necessary FOL premises for the deductive proof, write python program using Z3 (De Moura & Bjørner, 2008) that automatically checks the validity of the necessary FOL premises and conclusion, extracts final FOL conclusion that is used in the python program, and judges whether the proof is circular (i.e., whether the final FOL conclusion is included in one of necessary FOL premises.) (Figure 25, Figure 26). 4. If the proof is circular, then NL feedback indicating circularity of the proof is sent to Step 2, and the model re-generates an argument reconstruction. Otherwise, we run the python program that checks the validity of the reconstruction. However, if the program returns an error, the model takes this error message and re-generate the python program that fixes the error (Figure 27). If the reconstruction is invalid, then NL feedback indicating invalidity of the reconstruction is sent to Step 2, and the model re-generates an argument reconstruction. Otherwise (i.e., if the reconstruction is valid), we proceed to the next step. 5. To check faithfulness of the reconstruction, the model first translates FOL premises and conclusion (one of the outputs of the model in Step 2) with keys (one of the outputs of the model in Step 1) into NL premises and conclusion (Figure 28). This process is called logical streamlining in logic and critical thinking (Bowell & Kemp, 2014; Brun & Betz, 2016; Betz & Richardson, 2021). 6. Lastly, given an original argumentative review point (or an argument) and the streamlined NL premises and conclusion, the model judges whether the reconstruction is faithful with justifications (Figure 29). If the reconstruction is unfaithful, then NL feedback including the models justifications is sent to Step 2, and the model re-generates an argument reconstruction accordingly. Otherwise, since the reconstruction is valid yet faithful, the feedback loop is finished and the streamlined NL premises and conclusion become final argument reconstruction."

We mainly measure average validity and faithfulness of the reconstructed arguments using SAT solver and human annotators, respectively. We provide score rubric for evaluating faithfulness in Figure 4. We also include the pass rate, which indicates whether the (last) reconstructed argument fulfill the validity and faithfulness criteria in the feedback loop. Furthermore, we report the average number of loop iterations to check if the feedback loops are actively used. In Table 5, we verify that the proposed method (i.e., w/ feedback) achieves perfect validity and nearly perfect faithfulness and pass rate, whereas the performance of the direct reconstruction (i.e., w/o feedback) largely lags behind that. We observe that the average number of loop iterations is 3.09, indicating active usage of feedback signals, but the number varies lot depending on the clarity of logical structures of the arguments.

For each review point type, we demonstrate two representative examples which include model-based scores and corresponding justifications using claude-sonnet-3.7 and claude-sonnet-4. Input: Claim (Review Point) & Paper Paper: Towards Continual Knowledge Learning of Language Models (Jang et al., 2022) Claim (Review Point): The experimental findings in this paper are somewhat trivial. Human-annotated Label (5-point Scale) 3, 4, 4 (Median: 4) Output: ClaimScore Evaluation Model: claude-sonnet-3.7 Score: 2 Human-model Disagreement Type: Value judgment Justification: The proposition states that the experimental findings in this paper are somewhat trivial. To evaluate this claim, need to assess the novelty, significance, and depth of the experimental findings presented in the paper. Key experimental findings in the paper include: . . . These findings are not trivial because: - They establish new problem formulation and benchmark for an important real-world challenge - They provide novel insights about how different methods perform in this setting - They identify key factors affecting knowledge retention and acquisition - The findings have practical implications for developing ever-changing language models Model: claude-sonnet-4 Score: 2 Human-model Disagreement Type: Value judgment Justification: To evaluate whether the experimental findings are somewhat trivial, need to assess the novelty, significance, and non-obviousness of the results presented in the paper. **Novel contributions and non-trivial findings:** . . . **Overall assessment:** While some high-level expectations (like catastrophic forgetting occurring) are predictable, the specific findings about which methods work best, the quantitative trade-offs, the multi-phase degradation effects, and the detailed analysis of what causes forgetting provide substantial non-trivial insights. The systematic benchmarking and the discovery that traditional CL methods dont transfer well to this domain are significant contributions. The experimental work is comprehensive, the findings have practical implications for maintaining upto-date language models, and several results challenge conventional wisdom from traditional continual learning.

Human-annotated Label (5-point Scale) 2, 2, 3 (Median: 2) Output: ClaimScore Evaluation Model: claude-sonnet-3.7 Score: 3 Justification: The proposition states that The improvement is quite limited compared with other longtailed learning methods. To evaluate this claim, need to examine how the paper compares its proposed temperature scheduling (TS) approach with other long-tailed learning methods. Looking at the paper: . . . Given that the paper shows consistent improvements over the baselines and SDCLR, but doesnt compare with broader range of long-tailed learning methods, and the improvements are modest (1-3%), the proposition that the improvement is quite limited compared with other long-tailed learning methods is partially supported but not fully substantiated. Model: claude-sonnet-4 Score: Human-model Disagreement Type: Value judgment Justification: To evaluate this proposition, need to examine the experimental results and compare the improvements achieved by the proposed temperature scheduling (TS) method against other long-tailed learning methods. Looking at the experimental results: 1. **Comparison with SDCLR**: In Table 3, the paper compares SimCLR+TS with SDCLR (a specialized method for long-tailed contrastive learning). The improvements are modest. 2. **Absolute improvements**: The improvements over baseline methods are generally in the range of 14% across different metrics and datasets. 3. **Limited baseline comparisons**: The paper primarily compares against standard contrastive learning methods (MoCo, SimCLR) and only one specialized long-tailed method (SDCLR). It doesnt compare against other established long-tailed learning approaches from supervised learning or other self-supervised long-tailed methods. 4. **Scope of evaluation**: The evaluation is limited to relatively small datasets (CIFAR variants and ImageNet-100) and doesnt demonstrate performance on larger-scale long-tailed datasets that are commonly used in long-tailed learning literature. 5. **Method simplicity vs. improvement**: While the method is simple (just scheduling temperature), the improvements are incremental rather than substantial breakthroughs. The paper acknowledges this limitation implicitly by positioning the method as simple yet effective and emphasizing the zero additional computational cost, rather than claiming state-of-the-art performance improvements.

In other words, the proposed method does not find the best chain of thought prompts as claimed but rather believes that lets do this step by step is the best zero-shot-CoT prompting strategy and the method merely uses that with different prompt samples. The title and the abstract are highly misleading in that way. Premise: The method uses lets do this step by step with different prompt samples. Human-annotated Label (5-point Scale) 5, 5, 5 (Median: 5) Output: ClaimScore Evaluation Model: claude-sonnet-3.7 Score: 5 Justification: The premise states that the Auto-CoT method uses lets do this step by step with different prompt samples. need to check if this is accurate based on the paper. Looking at the paper, in the DEMONSTRATION SAMPLING section, the author describes how they construct demonstrations: prompted input is formulated as: [Q: q(i)j. A: [P]], where [P] is single prompt Lets think step to step. This formed input is fed into an LLM using Zero-Shot-CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) to output the reasoning chain consisting of the rationale r(i)j and the extracted answer a(i)j. . . . So the premise is accurate - the Auto-CoT method does use lets think step by step (or very similar variant Lets think step to step) with different prompt samples selected through their clustering and sampling approach. Model: claude-sonnet-4 Score: 2 Human-model Disagreement Type: Overthinking Justification: To judge the factuality of this premise, need to examine what the Auto-CoT method actually does according to the paper. From the paper, can see that: 1. Auto-CoT consists of two main stages: (i) question clustering and (ii) demonstration sampling 2. In the demonstration sampling stage, the method uses Zero-Shot-CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions 3. The paper explicitly states that Zero-Shot-CoT uses the prompt Lets think step by step (not lets do this step by step) . . . So the premise is mostly accurate in describing the approach (using Zero-Shot-CoT with different samples), but contains factual error in the exact wording of the prompt. The paper consistently uses Lets think step by step rather than lets do this step by step. Figure 11: Example #1 of ArgScore evaluation."

This work takes the dataset, clusters them, finds the most representative sample from each cluster, and uses that as prompts. There is nothing extra-ordinary about this approach and is merely small improvement over the randomly sampling strategy. This can also be seen from marginal improvement in the results over random sampling strategy. Premise: The approach is obvious (i.e., prompts must be representative of test samples). Human-annotated Label (5-point Scale) 4, 4, 5 (Median: 4) Output: ClaimScore Evaluation Model: claude-sonnet-3.7 Score: 2 Human-model Disagreement Type: Misunderstanding / incorrect reasoning Justification: Ill examine whether the paper itself acknowledges or implies that prompts should be representative of test samples as an obvious approach: . . . The papers main contribution is showing that diversity in demonstrations is important, not just representativeness. The paper states: diversity-based clustering may mitigate misleading by similarity and diversity of demonstration questions is the key. This suggests that the premise oversimplifies the papers findings. The paper doesnt claim that prompts must simply be representative it argues for balance of representativeness and diversity. Model: claude-sonnet-4 Score: 4 Justification: To judge the factuality, need to determine whether its true that prompts must be representative of test samples is an obvious principle. This is general statement about machine learning methodology and prompt engineering principles that would be known to AI practitioners before 2023. The idea that training/demonstration examples should be representative of test data is fundamental principle in machine learning that predates this specific paper. This principle is well-established in the field and doesnt require knowledge of this specific paper to evaluate its truth. The paper does implement this principle through clustering and selecting representative samples, but the general principle itself is established knowledge in the field.

Let me check if the paper discusses this concept or something similar: . . . However, the paper does not explicitly discuss applying the self-consistency technique directly to ReAct itself (i.e., sampling multiple ReAct trajectories and taking the majority action).

However, the question specifically asks about applying self-consistency directly to ReAct itself sampling multiple ReAct reasoning traces and actions and using majority voting.

To do that, choose an appropriate knowledge source from: 1. given paper 2. annotator knowledge before the year [[YEAR]] (more precisely, before the paper is publicized) 3. other paper(s), and then judge the factuality of the premise based on the knowledge source. You should scale 1-5 to indicate factuality as follows. {Factuality Score Rubric} Here are guidelines you should follow: - Main purpose is to distinguish *given paper* and *annotator knowledge*. - Select *other papers* only if the premise refers specific paper. - Note that you should separate judging the factuality of the premise from understanding the semantics of the premise. It does not matter whether *given paper* is needed or not to understand the semantics of the premise.

For example, although you need the papers context in order to understand what the premise means, if you do not need the papers knowledge to judge if the premise is true or not (e.g., logical assessment), then you should choose *annotator knowledge* as knowledge source and judge the factuality accordingly. - For premises that are conditionals (If then B), you should presume that the antecedent (A) is always true even if the antecedent does not align with the papers knowledge.

Prompt for Argument Reconstruction (check faithfulness) # Argument [[ARGUMENT]] # Argument Reconstruction ## Premises [[PREMISES]] ## Conclusion [[CONCLUSION]] For an argument, its reconstruction as premise-conclusion structure is given. Your task is to judge whether the construction is faithful or not. You should judge the faithfulness according to the following two criteria: - **Accuracy & Charity.** The reconstruction should keep the authors intended meaning while eliminating irrelevanciesi.e., obey the principle of charity and prefer the strongest sensible reading of ambiguous passages. - **Completeness.** All explicit premises, the main conclusion and any indispensable implicit premises must be included. The output format should be as following. # Reasoning [Explain step-by-step] # Faithfulness [Yes or No] Figure 29: Prompt used for evaluating faithfulness of reconstruction (check faithfulness)."
