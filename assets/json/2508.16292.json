            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models (Niu et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Niu et al., 2025) represent significant advancement in robotics, enabling agents to perform tasks using multimodal inputs by integrating visual perception, natural language understanding, and action generation. However, as these models are increasingly deployed in open-ended, real-world environments, they must handle diverse and often ambiguous instructions issued by users. Consider household * Equal contribution 1 Figure 1: Our Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA) framework is designed to handle false-premise instructions. When the robot receives command referencing non-existent object (a bottle), it detects the false premise, and generates clarifying response that corrects the instruction, suggesting valid alternative (a drawer). robot presented with the command, Bring me the red mug on the kitchen table, when no such mug exists. In this scenario, the robots ability to recognize the impossibility of the request, explain the issue, and suggest plausible alternatives is essential for safe and effective human-robot interaction. Yet, most existing VLAs lack mechanisms to detect or respond appropriately to instructions grounded in false premises - commands that reference objects, attributes, or relations not present in the environment. While large multimodal models have made significant strides in visual grounding and instruction following, prior research in both natural language processing and robotics has typically assumed that user instructions are feasible and contextually grounded. In domains such as visual question answering and dialogue, models have been studied for their robustness to unanswerable or contradictory queries have been developed which can evaluate and correct for false premises in the case of question answering (Johnson et al., 2017; Suhr et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Hudson and Manning, 2019; Gurari et al., 2018; Mahendru et al., 2017; Whitehead et al., 2022; Mashrur et al., 2023, 2022; Li et al., 2020; Prabhakar et al., 2018; Mahendru et al., 2017; Karnik et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023). However, in the context of embodied agents and robotics, the issue of handling false-premise instructions - recognizing unfulfillable commands and producing helpful language-based corrections - remains largely unexplored. Existing robotics benchmarks and VLAs focus on execution success given correct instructions, without testing how these systems respond when user intent is unattainable or ambiguous. To address this gap, we develop unified VLA model capable of interpreting and correcting false-premise instructions in robotic settings. Our framework combines large-scale instruction tuning with contextually-augmented datasets, enabling the model to detect unfulfillable requests, provide natural language feedback, and suggest alternative courses of action. See Figure 1. We evaluate our approach across eight robotic tasks, measuring false premise detection accuracy and the rate of successful responses in false-premise scenarios. Our method achieves an improvement of 97.56% in false premise detection over established baselines, and increases success in false-premise handling by 50.78%. These results demonstrate that language-aware robots can move beyond simple execution - reasoning about user intent, clarifying ambiguity, and interacting naturally even when confronted with the impossible."

            "content": "Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs). VLAs integrate visual perception, language understanding, and action generation to produce robot control sequences from visual observations and language instructions. Models such as LLARVA (Niu et al., 2024), π (Physical Intelligence et al., 2025), Gemini Robotics (Gemini Robotics et al., 2025), OpenVLA (Kim et al., 2024), RT-2 (Brohan et al., 2023b), PaLM-E embodied multimodal model (Driess et al., 2023), and LLaRA (Li et al., 2024) fine-tune pretrained large multimodal models (LMMs) to predict actions, often using special tokens to represent the action space. These models share the goal of adapting LMMs for robotic control as they differ in the choice of LMM and action encoding methods. While existing VLAs typically leverage language decoders pretrained for high-level tasks (e.g., image captioning (Kim et al., 2024) and VQA (Brohan et al., 2023a)), when deployed in diverse, real-world environments, they exhibit critical limitation: the inability to handle instructions grounded in false premises. Our work addresses this gap by explicitly training VLA models to recognize when referenced objects or conditions are absent and to respond appropriately. False Premises. The problem of detecting false premises has long been studied in NLP, particularly in QA benchmarks such as SQUAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) and False QA (Hu et al., 2023), with research primarily focused on model uncertainty for unanswerable questions (Raina and Gales, 2022; Sulem et al., 2022). This concept of false premises has recently spread from NLP to other areas of interest, including visual question answering (Ray et al., 2016), image/text matching (Feng and Lapata, 2012; Xu et al., 2015; Ordonez et al., 2011; Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015; Fang et al., 2015), image-grounded (Mostafazadeh conversation et al., 2017), tool usage (Toor et al., 2019) and hallucination detection (Rohrbach et al., 2018). Research in human-robot interaction has explored handling imperfect instructions and clarifying ambiguous instructions (Deits et al., 2013; Park et al., 2024; Prabhakar et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2024; Tellex et al., 2014), however this short paper is the first to explore false premise tasks in the context of vision-language-action models (VLAs)."

            "content": "Our method builds upon the LLARVA model (Niu et al., 2024), VLA architecture designed for robotic instruction following. LLARVA leverages instruction-tuned large multimodal models (LMMs) to jointly interpret visual observations, natural language instructions, and robot proprioception, outputting robot actions along with intermediate visual representations called visual traces. Input. LLARVA takes visual observation ot, an RGB image at timestep t, and structured natural-language instruction lt as input. The language instruction encodes the robot type (e.g., 2 Franka Panda), control mode (e.g., end-effector or joint control), task description (e.g., close the drawer), proprioceptive states (internally-sensed joint-angle vectors that indicate the robots current position before it plans the next move) from the previous timesteps, and the number of future actions (n) to predict, the instruction tuning template is shown as follows: You are [Robot] robot using [Control The task is [Task Mode] control. Description], [h] previous steps are [Proprioceptive States]. Can the you end-effector and the action of the next [n] steps? trajectory predict the the and of Model. LLARVA integrates three main components as follows: Vision Encoder: frozen pretrained visual encoder (CLIP ViT-L/14) encodes image observations ot into visual tokens. Language Encoder: Tokenizes and embeds the language instruction lt, forming language tokens. Multimodal Decoder: An autoregressive transformer decoder combines visual and language tokens, generating predictions for robotic actions At:t+n1 and future visual traces Pt:N , formally: π(ot,lt) At:t+n1,Pt:N where At:t+n1 represents predicted robot actions for the next steps, and Pt:N indicates predicted 2-D visual trajectories of the robots end-effector from timestep to episode end . LLARVA is initially pretrained on large-scale vision-action instruction data from Open XEmbodiment (OXE) and subsequently fine-tuned for specific robotic tasks, enabling strong generalization across diverse tasks and environments. False Premise Instruction Dataset. Following Niu et al. (2024), we utilize image-action pairs from the OXE dataset (Vuong et al., 2023), providing rich visual, language, and action representations. However, prior work did not explicitly address reasoning about the feasibility of user instructions. To address this gap, we constructed dedicated dataset explicitly curated to handle false premise scenarios and their corresponding corrections. Our false-premise instruction dataset is generated from robotic trajectories available in RLBench 3 (James et al., 2019). Each task in our dataset includes two categories of false premise instructions: In-Domain False Premise. These instructions involve geometrically similar and contextually plausible objects derived from related tasks, making the intended correction relatively intuitive. For instance, in the task of closing jar, if the user prompt is The task is close the blue safe, the model is expected to respond, dont see safe in the current scene. Do you mean jar?. Out-of-Domain False Premise. These instructions contain clearly infeasible or nonsensical requests involving objects or scenarios impossible within the given context. For example, during the open drawer task, if the user prompts \"The task is open the top elephant,\" the model should identify the absurdity and respond appropriately, such as \"I couldnt find elephant in the current scene,\" subsequently terminating the interaction since the request is fundamentally invalid. For training purposes, our dataset composition strategically includes approximately 20% of episodes containing Out-of-Domain false premises, and 65% of episodes containing In-Domain false premises injected into 10% of their respective steps. This deliberate distribution ensures comprehensive exposure and training of the model in recognizing and handling various types of erroneous instructions. IVA Training. We adopt an end-to-end instructiontuning approach, closely following LLARVAs training methodology, to train our model using the newly curated false-premise dataset. While keeping both the vision and language encoders frozen, we fine-tune the auto-regressive transformer decoder using standard LoRA adapters. Specifically, our training procedure utilizes 800 episodes per task, with each episode containing image observations ot, language instructions lt, ground-truth robotic actions ˆAt:t+n1, and visual traces ˆPt:N . The training data includes mixture of true-premise and false-premise instructions, with roughly 20% of episodes containing Out-of-Domain false premises and approximately 65% containing In-Domain false premises, introduced at 10% of steps within each episode. Given ot and lt, the model predicts actions and visual traces auto-regressively: p( ˆAt:t+n1, ˆPt:N ot,lt) = (cid:89) pθ(xi ot,lt) i=1 where θ denotes trainable parameters, xi is the Table 1: Comparison of IVA and LLaRVA across RLBench tasks: overall success rate, FP (false premise) detection rate (In-Domain/Out-of-Domain), and TP (true premise) success rate. The overall success rate is computed as the average of true and false premises success rates.

We compute the training loss as the standard cross-entropy between predicted tokens and ground-truth annotations. Unlike LLARVAs two-stage procedure (pretraining and fine-tuning), we train our model end-to-end on our unified dataset, ensuring simultaneous learning of accurate robotic action prediction, robust false-premise detection, and appropriate language-based correction responses."

            "content": "We evaluated IVA on two aspects: its ability to detect and correct false-premise (FP) instructions, and its performance on standard, true-premise (TP) tasks. Experiment Setup. We conducted experiments on 9 RLBench tasks, generating 25 episodes per task with randomly varied object positions. Each episode was paired with two type of user prompts: one standard and one containing false premise. During fine-tuning, the model received the front camera view and the previous 5 joint positions as input, and predicted both the visual trace and the next action step, represented as an 8-dimensional vector (7 joint velocities plus binary gripper state). We report the success/failure rates for one fixed seed per task on the validation set, comparing with LLARVA as baseline. The results are shown in Table 1. Evaluation Procedure. We evaluate IVA in single-pass, end-to-end setting on all 225 episodes (25 episodes 9 RLBench tasks) with randomized object poses. For each episode, we generate trueor false-premise instruction and score IVAs full response as follows: (1) Detection Stage. IVA first outputs textual response, which we parse to classify the instruction as either Accept (True-Premise) or Clarify/Refuse (False-Premise). Accept (True-Premise): Scored 1 if the exactly subsequent executed matches the ground-truth; otherwise 0. trajectory Clarify/Refuse (False-Premise): Scored 1 for an explicit out-of-domain refusal (e.g., Im sorry, that object isnt here. . . ). For in-domain false premises, scored 1 if the object is correctly re-targeted, and 0 if any impossible action is attempted. For multi-step episodes, we average the per-step Detection scores to yield single FP score per episode. (2) Execution Stage. Whenever IVA Accepts, we execute the predicted 8D joint-velocity sequence. Each RLBench tasks built-in success detector then labels the outcome as success (1) or failure (0). (3) Overall Accuracy. We average the 225 episode scores (Detection + Execution) to yield single accuracy metric that jointly rewards correct task execution and safe refusal/clarification behavior. False Premise Detection and Correction. major challenge in real-world robotics is handling instructions that reference unavailable objects or impossible actions. To address this, we fine-tuned IVA on curated false-premise dataset and evaluated it alongside the true-premise-trained baseline. Test prompts included both In-Domain false premises (plausible but absent objects, e.g., open the middle block when only drawer is present) and Out-of4 Domain false premises (impossible requests, e.g., open the top chicken for drawer task). IVA achieved perfect detection (100%) on InDomain false-premise instructions, consistently identifying and correcting these cases. For Outof-Domain false premises, IVA reached detection accuracy of 97.78%. In both scenarios, IVA generated contextually appropriate clarificationssuch as dont see tree in the current scene. Do you mean jar?for In-Domain false premise and terminate the interaction when face the Out-of-Domain false premise. Performance on True-Premise Tasks. To ensure that enhanced false-premise reasoning does not compromise standard performance, we tested IVA on tasks with only true-premise instructions. IVA maintained success rate of 42.67%8.34% compared to the baselines 38.67% 8.55%. The observed difference lies well within the variance range, suggesting that the slight drop in performance is statistically insignificant. Action prediction accuracy and overall task completion remained fairly stable, confirming that robust false-premise handling does not significantly degrade general competence."

Our approach achieves strong performance in both false-premise detection and standard task execution, demonstrating the value of explicit false-premise reasoning in VLA models. We hope these results demonstrate the potential of language-aware robots to engage more naturally and safely with users, even when faced with ambiguous or impossible commands. Future work will focus on extending IVAs capabilities to more complex environments and real-world deployments. Finally, we do not anticipate specific negative impact, but, as with any machine learning method, we recommend exercising caution."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "While our IVA framework demonstrates strong performance in detecting and correcting false-premise instructions within vision-language-action (VLA) models, several limitations remain that should be addressed in future work: Dataset Scope and Realism. Our false-premise instruction dataset is primarily generated from the RLBench environment, which, despite its diversity, remains simulated domain with constrained set of objects, scenes, and tasks. Consequently, the distribution and complexity of false-premise instructions may not fully capture the ambiguity and diversity encountered in real-world human-robot interaction. Moreover, the proportion of In-Domain and Out-of-Domain false premises is artificially balanced to facilitate training and evaluation, and may not reflect the true incidence of such instructions in open-world settings. Generalization to Real-World Deployment. Although IVA achieves high detection rates in simulation, its robustness in real-world deployments is not yet validated. Domain shiftsuch as differences in visual appearance, sensor noise, or language usagecould degrade performance. Additionally, our framework assumes that visual observations and proprioceptive data are accurately and reliably captured, which may not always hold in practical robotics scenarios. Correction and Clarification Strategies. The natural language responses generated by IVA are limited to clarifications and suggestions based on the specific types of false premises represented in the training data. The models ability to propose truly creative or contextually appropriate alternatives remains limited, especially for Out-of-Domain or out-of-distribution instructions. In more complex environments, nuanced reasoning about task feasibility, user intent, and multi-turn clarification dialogues may be necessary. Instruction and Environment Complexity. The instructions used for evaluation are relatively short and structured, and the environments contain modest number of distractor objects. Real human instructions can be longer, more ambiguous, and embedded in broader conversational contexts. Our current framework does not explicitly handle multiturn dialogues, implicit user intent, or ambiguous references beyond the immediate instruction. Scalability and Efficiency. Our approach leverages instruction-tuned large multimodal models with frozen vision and language encoders, which, while effective, may impose computational and memory overhead unsuitable for some real-time or resource-constrained robotic applications."

            "title": "E Infeasible Instruction Generation",
            "content": "To generate infeasible instructions, we first curate two distractor pools of nouns: 1. In-Domain: objects that appear in our RLBench scenes (e.g., blue safe, drawer, mug). 2. Out-of-Domain: objects never seen in the scenes (e.g., sofa, durian, elephant), drawn from list generated by GPT. We then rewrite 85% of the original true-premise prompts using one of two LLM-based rewriters: 1. In-Domain FP (65% overall): replace the target OBJECT by sampling from the In-Domain pool, ensuring the new noun is absent from that episodes scene. 2. Out-of-Domain FP (20% overall): replace the target OBJECT with noun sampled from the Out-of-Domain pool. Finally, we manually reviewed 200 randomly selected rewritten prompts to verify grammaticality and correctness."
