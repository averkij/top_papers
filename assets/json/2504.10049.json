By leveraging multimodal elements such as visual\nslides and speech, presentations offer a dynamic and engaging way to present ideas and data. Their\nsheer volume and the frequency with which individuals encounter them make summarization both\na practical and a pressing need. Summaries of multimodal presentations allow users to efficiently\nextract key points, navigate the presentation, and improve retention, without requiring in-depth\nengagement with the full presentation.",
            "content": "Presentations are multimodal when they include visual medium, typically slideshow, in addition to the speech. Meetings, lectures, and conferences commonly follow this format. Multimodal presentation records usually consist of text-heavy video and audio streams. transcript and key images that span the entire video can be extracted from these records [14]. Using these extracted modalities or the original modalities, one can construct representations of the presentation to be used by VLMs to perform tasks such as summarization. Examples of such unimodal and multimodal representations for presentation are illustrated in Figure 1. The choice of representation will have different token lengths and result in different downstream performances and costs. VLMs are usually trained and evaluated on short input, including text and few images, or short videos [4, 29]. Previous works have highlighted the poor performance of these models with longer input [43]. Although long context performance on synthetic benchmarks can be inherited from the underlying language model [48], they usually do not reflect performance in real-world scenarios [24]. The raw video representation can be too long and lie significantly outside of the training context size for these models, rendering summarization very challenging [41]. However, we can build shorter interleaved image-text representation resembling the training data of some VLMs [4, 20, 21].

VLMs are able to process multimodal presentation in various unimodal and multimodal representations. In this paper, we examine how the choice of representation of multimodal presentations affects their associated cost and performance for VLM-based summarization. We specify different representations for the model, using single or multiple modalities, including slides, text extracted from slides, the entire video, and the transcribed audio, optionally structured by using the time-alignment between these modalities. Furthermore, we perform fine-grained analysis of the performance of Qwen2-VL [41] with these different input representations to understand the impact of the modalities and the structure information on the generated summaries. Additionally we benchmark multiple recent state-of-the-art open-weights VLMs using an interleaved slides-transcript representation. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: We benchmark open-weights VLMs for summarization of multimodal presentations using an interleaved slides-transcript input. We conduct fine-grained quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cost and performance associated with many unimodal and multimodal input representations in Qwen2-VL. We suggest cost-effective representation strategies for summarization of multimodal presentations with VLMs. We discuss the challenges emerging from using multimodal representations in VLMs and share suggestions to mitigate the current shortcomings."

Summarization of Multimodal Presentations with Vision-Language Models 3 Current Large Language Models (LLMs), based on the transformer decoder architecture, perform multiple tasks, including abstractive summarization, with remarkable success [47]. Their capabilities even scale to very large input due to efficient attention implementations [10, 11] and context extension methods [35]. However, these methods fall short for summarization of multimodal presentations because they neglect the visual modality, which is often critical to convey information in such contexts."

VLMs can also be trained with interleaved text and images [4], meaning that they can process an arbitrary number of images in between text tokens. Some VLMs can also process video input on top of images, optionally using dedicated video encoder [26]. Video VLMs are usually trained with minutes-long in-the-wild videos picturing little to no text [32]. In contrast, the video stream of multimodal presentation records is typically long, redundant, and text-heavy. As such, summarization of multimodal presentations lies out of the training domain of video VLMs, and, by extracting key frames, can be made more similar to the domain for recent VLMs using the interleaved images-text format [4, 20, 21]. Wu et al. [43] highlighted the low performance of open-weights VLMs for long-context interleaved video-language understanding. Zhang et al. [48] suggested that VLMs can inherit longcontext performance from their underlying LLMs, exemplifying on synthetic benchmark. However, Li et al. [24] showed that the performance of LLMs on synthetic benchmarks does not reflect realworld performance."

[14] stated that the extracted key frames in the TIB dataset often contain screenrecorded or live-captured slideshows, but can also be live recording of the speaker. To filter out the latter, we use SigLip [46] to perform zero-shot classification on key frames to identify those that contain slide and those that do not. We discard the key frames that are not slides, and the presentations with less than 3 slides after this stage. After processing, our benchmark consists of 822 presentations, including transcribed speech and slides with time codes. Using these time codes, we can create an interleaved sequence of slides followed by transcription of the simultaneous speech.

In the benchmark, we include other VLMs capable of handling our multimodal presentations, namely Idefics-2 [21], Idefics-3 [20], and Phi-3.5-vision [1].

It gives an accurate estimate of the overall performance of system. Rouge-𝑛 counts the 𝑛-gram overlaps between the proposed summary and reference summary. We will work primarily with unigram and bigram-based Rouge scores, denoted Rouge-1 (𝑅1) and Rouge-2 (𝑅2). GRUEN (𝐺) [51] is reference-free metric intended to evaluate the linguistic quality of generated texts. It only uses the generated text as input, so it does not need to account for the input being long and multimodal. The importance-based relevance score (𝐼𝑏𝑅) [15] has been designed to provide reference-free evaluation of the relevance of the summaries. The relevance of summary is the measure of whether it contains the main ideas from the source document. As this metric relies on word importance scoring based on information retrieval methods, it scales well with long input and has been shown to correlate well with human-evaluated relevance of summaries on long-document summarization datasets. It uses the source as textual reference and will have to be adapted for use with multimodal input. To this end, we are using extracted text from the speech and/or slides as sources. Similarly to the extractive statistics, we define three modes for this metric, in accordance to the source input, called ocr, transcript and overall. These input-modality-specific metrics allow us to conduct more fine-grained analysis of the generated summaries with respect to the input modalities. The Rouge scores (𝑅1 and 𝑅2) provide us with an estimate of the overall performance of the summarization systems. GRUEN (𝐺) scores the linguistic qualities of the systems. Finally, the multimodality-adapted importance-based relevance scores (𝐼𝑏𝑅transcript, 𝐼𝑏𝑅ocr and 𝐼𝑏𝑅overall) give us an estimate of how well the model gathers the important information from the document, attributed to each input modality."

Laurençon et al. [21] observed no gain from adding visual tokens per image after 64, while Laurençon et al. [20] observed that the OCR task benefited from more visual tokens per image. Similarly to OCR, the summarization of multimodal presentations is based on text-heavy images. In Section 5.2, we investigate the scaling of performance with more visual tokens per image to see if these observations translate to this task. Even with smaller parameter count, Phi-3.5-vision scores significantly better than Idefics-3, most likely due to its training data including videos and more long context examples. Between Idefics-3 and Phi-3.5-vision, the difference in performance seems to be linked to the language model more than the vision encoder, probably because of better long context understanding. Qwen2-VL scores even better than Phi-3.5-vision, with smaller parameter count, likely due to various improvements including larger visual token budget and larger and more diverse training dataset. Contrary to Phi-3.5-vision, it can process the whole non-truncated input with non-quantized weights. The importance-based relevance (𝐼𝑏𝑅) scores reveal that with these models, visual and textual understanding are improved jointly. new VLM release usually relies simultaneously on better training data and better backbone LLM, causing both visual and language understanding to improve. For all these models, the task of summarization of multimodal presentations is most likely out-of-domain, which would benefit models such as Qwen2-VL, trained on broad range of tasks, including analogous ones such as long document and video understanding.

We conjecture that the visual stream can be preprocessed to keep only few key frames without significant loss of information. The method for obtaining these key frames is described in the paper that introduces the TIB dataset [14] and focuses on retrieving the slides from the video stream. In order to validate this assumption, we feed the model with either the full video or the extracted key frames. We conduct experiments with different sample rates: 0.1 frames per second, following Liu et al. [28], or 1 frame per second. The average input token length rapidly grows very large with more tokens per frame, as detailed in Table 2. Fig. 3. Unimodal performance at different token budgets Figure 3 shows the performance of the model with input of single modality: video, slides or transcript. At all visual token budgets per frame, the slides input outperforms the video input, all while consisting of much fewer frames (cf Table 2). The use of key frame input demonstrates notable advantage with significantly improved performance and substantially lower computational Summarization of Multimodal Presentations with Vision-Language Models 9 cost, as evidenced in Table 2. The key frame input with high per slide budget also compares favorably with the transcript input. As way to represent the multimodal input for the model, we consider two options: concatenating the text after the slides or interleaving the tokens according to the temporal information gathered during preprocessing. In the interleaved format, the visual tokens for slide are directly followed by the tokens of the transcribed simultaneous speech. Thus the images are near the related text in the sequence. The other option is sequence of all slides followed by the transcribed speech. In this default representation, we do not leverage any knowledge about the structure of the presentation. We conjecture that the interleaved format gives useful information about the structure of the presentation to the model. In order to verify and quantify this claim, we feed the model interleaved or concatenated modalities and evaluate the generated summaries. We call these experiments structure and no structure respectively in Figure 4. Due to the scaling of the Transformer computation with sequence length [40], larger visual token budget mechanically increases the computation for given document. The additional tokens can also be repurposed by the model for internal computations [12], in phenomenon called \"register\" tokens. In an attempt to decouple this additional computation with the benefit of visual information, we conducted an ablation study by replacing the slides with placeholder black images. When slides are not included in the input, these placeholder slides are added to keep the same total computation budget, and watch for an effect similar to the \"register\" tokens discussed by Darcet et al. [12]. Fig. 4. The addition of structure improves the Rouge score compared to the transcript alone The resulting experiments enable us to watch for the outcome of the structure information for summarization, decoupled from the effect of additional computations. As illustrated in Figure 4, scaling the register token budget for the placeholder slides does not show trend on the measured Rouge score, but random variation around the mean that we believe is an artifact of the added noise. However, the structure information offers significant improvement compared to the text-only baseline."

Comparing the transcript only with the OCR-augmented textual baseline in Figure 5, we see that access to the text printed on the slide improves the performance. However, the slides can be more informative than the text printed on them. For example, the formatting of the text, the colors, and the illustrations can convey meaning. In fact, the summaries generated with the visual input greatly exceed the textual baseline augmented with OCR, suggesting that the textual content of the slides covers only small amount of the overall semantics they provide.

Figure 11 illustrates this change in model behavior when scaling the visual token budget in the structured multimodal representation. The summaries become less extractive with respect to the speech (via transcript), while keeping similar relevance, meaning that the extractive fragments are more relevant on average. At the same time, the summaries become more extractive and more relevant with respect to visual content (via OCR). Overall, the summaries are less extractive and more relevant. We observe that with sufficient visual token budget, the structure and unstructured multimodal input seemed to converge to comparable performance.

They describe their interleaved image-text data as longer than the captioning data and with more diverse text with less relevance on average to images. We believe that the interleaved image-text that is extracted from multimodal presentations describes different flavor of cross-modal interactions compared to the interleaved image-text documents typically found in VLMs training data. The latters interleaved image-text documents mainly come from articles, in which the images are usually used for merely illustrative purposes. 16 Théo Gigant, Camille Guinaudeau, and Frédéric Dufaux"

In order to create a comprehensive summary, a VLM should be able\nto cross-reference modalities. Some visual question answering benchmarks [9, 22] are designed to\nrequire cross-referencing between modalities. They show the limited performance of VLMs in this\ntask and their dependence on external tools such as information retrieval pipelines.",
            "content": "Additionally, mismatched or conflicting information can be presented across modalities. For example, when the speaker verbally states fact that contradicts the content displayed on slide, due to typographical error, last-minute change (cf Table 5), or an erratum. The contradiction can also be sourced from inaccuracies during preprocessing, eg the transcription (cf Table 3). In our understanding of the training data domains, VLMs are not substantially faced with this type of data during training, and therefore are not explicitly trained to handle these situations. Liu et al. [31] explored the conflict between VLMs internal knowledge and its visual input. They proposed prompting strategy as way to steer the VLM into trusting vision over internal knowledge. Sarcasm detection in VLMs [8] is another line of work that represents typical example of conflicting modalities. In these cases, the task implicitly defines stronger modality, on which trust should be focused. In multimodal presentations, errors can appear in both modalities, even in the same sample. Consequently, no overall stronger modality can be chosen. Liu et al. [30] described weak modalities as modalities that are very noisy but could provide relevant information on per sample basis. They advocate for multiplicative method rather than additive to merge modalities in late-fusion scenario, effectively leveraging the lower uncertainty, or entropy, associated with weak modalities in relevant situations. Modern VLMs are early-fusion models. Therefore it is not trivial to adapt this uncertainty-based method to merge decisions based on each modality."

In their experiments, this gap is substantial and results in the VLM being inconsistent with different input modalities. Deng et al. [13] observed \"Blind Faith in Text\" effect where VLMs tend to trust textual input when it is inconsistent with the visual data, or incorrect. In contrast, in our experiments, the model was able to correct errors in the transcript by relying on visual information (cf Table 3), probably because it was informed in its prompt that the text is transcript, therefore implicitly error prone. These works illustrate some of the inherent challenges in the abstractive summarization of multimodal presentations.

            "content": "Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show the benefit of representing the input presentation record as interleaved slides and transcript. This structured multimodal representation results in higher scores for VLMs and extends the Pareto frontier of input-length-optimal methods beyond the use of slides alone. The use of both modalities offers many benefits, such as providing additional information and enabling spell checking through cross-referencing modalities. Multimodal systems produce summaries that are less extractive with respect to speech or text displayed on slides. They also include more relevant elements of the presentation, sourced from either one or both modalities. However, discrepancies between transcript and slides pose challenges for the VLM and occasionally exhibit impromptu side effects. We discuss some of the challenges that arise from interactions between conflicting modalities in multimodal presentations. Consequently, we advocate for the inclusion of more diverse crossmodality interactions in the training data mixtures for VLMs, specifically documents involving mismatched or conflicting modalities. Such data is commonly encountered in real-world scenarios such as multimodal presentations, where the visual content displayed is often commented upon, expanded, or even criticized in the accompanying speech. Data of this nature can also be sourced from reviews and commentaries, or created synthetically by altering modality [13]. By incorporating more documents with conflicting modalities into datasets and benchmarks, future research can better understand and mitigate the effects of cross-modal interactions in VLMs. This would pave the way for the development of more robust, reliable, and trustworthy multimodal systems.
