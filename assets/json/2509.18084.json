            "content": "With the rapid advancement of robotic technology, robot application scenarios have shifted dramatically from open and highly structured environments to complex and unstructured settings such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly [1, 2]. Among these scenarios, operations in narrow and confined spaces, such as handling objects in cluttered home cabinets, performing minimally invasive surgical interventions in human body cavities, and assembling precision components in automotive engine compartments have put forward increasingly stringent requirements for the flexibility, compactness, and dynamic responsiveness of robotic end-effectors, especially robotic wrists. Traditional serial robotic wrists, composed of multiple sequentially connected rotational joints, have the advantages of straightforward kinematic modeling [3, 4] and large rotational range per joint [5, 6]. However, 1 (a) Components Description in Wireframe. (b) Parameters Description in Prototype. Figure 1 Design and Development of ByteWrist. their open-chain structure leads to accumulated errors, low structural stiffness, and relatively bulky overall volume. When operating in narrow spaces, the multi-link serial structure is prone to collision with the surrounding environment, limiting their maneuverability. In contrast, parallel robotic wrists, which actuate the end platform through multiple parallel branches, demonstrate higher structural rigidity, superior load capacity, and better motion accuracy. However, existing parallel wrist configurations with different structural designs and actuation methods struggle to simultaneously meet the requirements of compactness and flexibility [7], as well as those of high rigidity, high load capacity and simple transmission mode [812]. This renders them less suitable for anthropomorphic manipulation tasks that necessitate both high dexterity and strong spatial adaptability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes novel parallel robotic wrist named ByteWrist. The core design concept of ByteWrist is to integrate compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism with arc-shaped end linkages, achieving precise RPY motion [1316] of the end platform while maintaining small structural footprint. Compared with existing parallel and serial wrists, ByteWrist features three key innovations: 1. High Compactness: The nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize the overall volume while enabling independent control of multiple degrees of freedom. 2. High Efficiency: The arc-shaped end linkages optimize the force transmission path and expand the effective motion range of the end platform. 3. High Stiffness: The central supporting ball functioned as spherical joint enhances structural stiffness without sacrificing flexibility. This paper is organized as follows: Section II elaborates on the mechanical structure of ByteWrist, encompassing its drive mechanism, linkage design, and key structural parameters. Section III establishes the forward and inverse kinematic models for the wrist, and proposes numerical solution for the Jacobian matrix to ensure precise control. Section IV validates the performance of ByteWrist through three sets of experiments: motion range testing, narrow-space maneuverability comparison with Kinova, and dual-arm chest-front cooperative manipulation for clothes hanging. Finally, Section summarizes the research findings and discusses prospective improvements."

            "title": "2 STRUCTURE OF BYTEWRIST",
            "content": "ByteWrist is illustrated in Fig. 1a, which is driven by three stage motors. The output of the first-stage motor is connected to the first-stage driving linkage, which is further linked to the parallel platform via an arc-shaped end linkage. Meanwhile, the second-stage motor is mounted inside the first-stage driving linkage, its output connects to the second-stage driving linkage, which is also linked to the parallel platform through an arc-shaped end linkage. Similarly, the third-stage motor is fixed within the second-stage driving linkage, with its output attached to the third-stage driving linkage that connects to the parallel platform via an arc-shaped end linkage. 2 All three stage driving linkages and arc-shaped end linkages, as well as arc-shaped end linkages and parallel platform, are connected via revolute pairs. All these six revolute pairs are oriented toward the center of the parallel platform. To enhance the stiffness of the parallel platform, supporting ball is mounted at its center and connected to the platform via spherical joint. By controlling the movement of three stage motors, the end parallel platform can achieve precise RPY motion. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, the prototype of ByteWrist adopts Quasi-Direct Drive [1719] based actuators manufactured by RobStride Dynamics. R1 denotes the rotation radius of the connection point between all three stage driving linkages and arc-shaped end linkages, R2 denotes the rotation radius of the connection point between arc-shaped end linkages and the parallel platform. The center distance between these two rotation planes is h. The arc-shaped end linkage consists of 90-degree arc and two straight segments connected to the arc, where the radius of the arc is Rl and the length of two straight segments are l1 and l2 respectively, as described in Fig. 1b. Above mentioned parameters are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Structural Parameters of ByteWrist (Unit: mm) R1 27.35 R2 27.35 Rl 25 l1 l2 13."

            "content": "To achieve precise control of ByteWrist, deriving its forward and inverse kinematics is essential. For clarity of description, its structure is simplified as illustrated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Coordinate System Definition of ByteWrist. Points P1, P2 and P3 lie on the axis of the revolute joint connecting the arc-shaped end linkage and the driving linkage, and are situated on the inner surface of arc-shaped end linkages. Points P4, P5, and P6 lie on the axis of the revolute joint between the arc-shaped end linkage and the parallel platform, and are similarly located on the inner surface of arc-shaped end linkages. Point O0 is the center of the circle passing through points P1, 3 O0X0 points to P1, while P2 and P3 with radius of R1. Correspondingly point O1 is the center of the circle passing through points P4, P5 and P6 with radius of R2. For the coordinate system {O0X0Y0Z0}, when the parallel wrist is in its O0Z0 aligns with the axis of the driving motor, with its positive initial position, direction defined as Fig. 2 presents. For the coordinate system {O1X1Y1Z1}, its coordinate axis are parallel to coordinate system {O0X0Y0Z0}, and the distance between O1 and O0 is h. θ0 is the angle of P1O1O0, O0X0 direction, note and θ1, θ2, θ3 are respectively the angles between the three driving linkages and the that at initial position θ1 = 0, θ2 = 240, θ3 = 120. Generally, in the design process, R1, R2, and are structural parameters to be determined with high priority by taking the wrist actuators diameter into consideration. Once these three parameters are confirmed, the relationships between the parameters Rl, l1, and l2 of the arc-shaped end linkage can be calculated using (1). After Rl is further determined, the overall structural design can be completed. θ0 = arctan(R1/h) Rl + l2 = h/ cos θ0 Rl + l1 = R2 (1)"

            "content": "The kinematics of the parallel wrist involves solving the relationship between θ1, θ2, θ3 and the RPY angles of the parallel platform. For the forward kinematics part, the inputs are θ1, θ2, θ3, and the outputs are RPY angles of the parallel platform. When three driving linkages rotate to θ1, θ2, and θ3, the arc-shaped end linkages P1P4, P2P5 and P3P6 rotate O1P3 by φ1, φ2 and φ3 respectively. As can be seen from the geometric structure of around the parallel wrist, the coordinates of points P1, P2, and P3 are Pi = (R1 cos θi, R1 sin θi, 0)(i = 1, 2, 3). O1P2 and O1P1, The coordinates of points Pi(i = 1 6) in their initial positions are denoted as Pi0. In the initial position, θ1 = 0, θ2 = 4π/3, and θ3 = 2π/3. It can be calculated that P40 = (R2 sin θ1, R2 cos θ1, h), P50 = (R2 sin θ2, R2 cos θ2, h), P60 = (R2 sin θ3, R2 cos θ3, h). When the parallel wrist moves to any position, the coordinates of points P4, P5, and P6 can be derived as (2). Pi+3.x = R2 cos φi sin θi + R2 sin φi cos θ0 cos θi Pi+3.y = R2 cos φi cos θi + R2 sin φi cos θ0 sin θi Pi+3.z = R2 sin φi sin θ0 + (i = 1, 2, 3) Thus vectors O1P4, O1P5, O1P6 can be expressed in (3). O1Pi+3 = (Pi+3.x, Pi+3.y, R2 sin φi sin θ0)(i = 1, 2, 3) The angle between each pair of these three vectors is 2π/3, and (4) can be obtained.

Given that this system of equations is nonlinear, the Newton-Raphson method is adopted herein for iterative solution. This paper adopts the RPY method to describe the attitude of the parallel platform. Let {O2X2Y2Z2} denote the coordinate system of the parallel platform after rotation. Specifically, the platform undergoes rotations around the X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis of the original coordinate system {O1X1Y1Z1} by γ(Roll), β(Pitch) and α(Yaw) respectively. The rotation matrix describing the attitude transformation of the parallel platform is expressed in (5).

As discussed previously, the iterative Newton-Raphson method inherently gives rise to rounding errors. In the numerical solution of the Jacobian matrix of the wrist, special consideration must be given to the effect of step size θ on the precision of the results. The motion process of the wrist under the conditions θ1 = 0, θ2 = 4π/3 and θ3 ranging from 2π/3 to π is simulated using Creo software. The RPY angles of the parallel platform were recorded at step size of π/3000. series of step sizes (1e 1, 1e 2, ..., 1e 7) are selected to calculate both the maximum error and root mean square error (RMSE) of the elements in Jacobian matrix. Comparative analysis revealed that the smallest values of both maximum error and RMSE for matrix occur when the step size θ is 1e 3. Consequently, step size of θ = 1e 3 is chosen for solving the Jacobian matrix via the numerical method."

Postures of ByteWrist at 8 distinct moments are presented in Fig. 4(d-k), each corresponding to different pitch and yaw angles. Throughout the wrist movement, the yaw direction remains constant. Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic wrist exhibits flexible motion within this operational region. In the actual control of the wrist, the three aforementioned motion exhibit delay of approximately 0.06 s, attributed to communication and computation latencies. Owing to variations in motion speed, the errors between the state and command curves are 0.064 rad, 0.127 rad, and 0.247 rad, respectively, when the pitch or roll angle is 0 rad. Consequently, in high-dynamic applications, the influence induced by such lag must be considered, whereas it can be neglected in low-speed control scenarios."

This box is constructed from transparent acrylic material, with dimensions of 1000 mm (length) 500 mm (width) 600 mm (height). There are two access holes (each in diameter 200 mm) on the front panel of the cabinet, with center-to-center distance in 500 mm. Figure 5 Glove Box Experimental Scenario Setup. Nine grasping target objects were arranged inside the glove box, including plastic doll, plush bear, bath flower, and six donut toys. The specific distribution of these objects in the glove box is illustrated in Fig. 5. The design objective is to evaluate the difficulty of grasping tasks in different spatial regions through two access holes, thereby achieving the assessment of the maneuverability of robotic arms. The grasping experiment procedure is as follows. The ByteMini robot is tele-operated to extend both arms into the glove box. Subsequently, its waist and mobile chassis are kept stationary, and the current pose of the arms are recorded as the initial pose. Next, the arms are tele-operated via Quest VR to attempt grasping the objects inside the glove box and placing them into the blue storage basket. Once the object is placed into the blue storage box, the robot arm is subsequently returned to its initial pose in preparation for the next grasping attempt. Throughout the procedure, the duration to grasp each object (between two initial poses) is recorded. The grasping sequence is as follows: plastic doll, plush bear, bath flower, and Donut Toys 16.

Gripper Camera Out of the Box: When attempting to grasp donut toy 1 and donut toy 3, the rotation of the Kinovas wrist will cause the collision between the gripper camera and the inner front wall of the glove box, if the gripper camera remains in the glove box. Thus, the gripper camera must first be moved out of the glove box before grasping, which leads to longer grasping time. 3.

            "content": "This paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of ByteWrist, compact parallel robotic wrist developed for flexible operation in narrow and confined spaces. The research achievements and key conclusions are summarized as follows: 1. Innovative Structural Design: ByteWrist adopts three-stage motor-driven parallel mechanism, combined with arc-shaped end linkages and central supporting ball. This design achieves balance between compactness and stiffness. The prototype test confirms that the wrist can stably realize continuous 11 RPY motion, meeting the requirements of anthropomorphic manipulation in confined spaces. 2. Complete Kinematic Modeling: The forward and inverse kinematic models of ByteWrist are established. For forward kinematics, the Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the nonlinear equations, realizing the mapping from driving linkage angles θ1, θ2, θ3 to parallel platform RPY angles. For inverse kinematics, the rotation matrix is derived based on given RPY angles to calculate the required driving linkage angles. Additionally, numerical method with an optimized step size (θ = 1e 3 ) is proposed to solve the Jacobian matrix, providing theoretical basis for high-precision motion control. 3. Excellent Performance Validation: Experimental results demonstrate ByteWrist can achieve highdynamic and large-angle motion. Compared with the Kinova dual-arm robot with serial wrists, ByteMini (integrated with ByteWrist) features higher integration and greater flexibility. ByteMini completes 116 hours of data collection for dexterous clothes-hanging tasks and realizes fully automated operation, verifying ByteWrists ability to cooperate with dual arms for high-precision deformable object manipulation. For future improvements, we will consider optimize the structure parameters for extending the motion range.
