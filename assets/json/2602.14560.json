It exhibits hallmark features of low-dimensional nonlinear dynamics:\nirregular oscillations on a\n2–7 year timescale, amplitude asymmetry between warm and cold phases, phase-locking to the annual cycle, and\nsensitivity to stochastic forcing [1, 2, 3]. These properties emerge from coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks—the\nBjerknes mechanism, delayed oscillator dynamics, and recharge-discharge processes—that generate quasi-periodic\nbehavior from deterministic nonlinear interactions modulated by noise [4].

            "content": "Representing such systems for diverse audiences poses fundamental challenge. Traditional visualization presupposes graphical literacy and engages single sensory channel [6]. Sonificationthe systematic transformation of data into non-speech audiooffers complementary modality by leveraging the human auditory systems sensitivity to temporal structure, pattern recurrence, and multi-stream processing [7, 8]. Critically, sonification itself constitutes complex mapping: nonlinear transformation between the state space of the source system and an acoustic parameter space, where the dynamical properties of the output depend jointly on the input signal, the mapping function, and the musical framework employed. Whether and how well sonification preserves the dynamical structure of the source system is question amenable to the tools of complex systems science. Yet climate sonification has been pursued almost exclusively within Western musical frameworksequal temperament, common-practice harmony, orchestral timbreswithout examining how alternative tonal systems might encode dynamical structure differently [9, 10]. This is missed opportunity. Music itself exhibits complex systems characteristics: 1/f spectral scaling in pitch and loudness fluctuations, long-range correlations, hierarchical temporal organization, and emergent structure from simple generative rules [11, 12]. Different musical traditions realize these properties through different structural mechanisms. Javanese gamelan, in particular, organizes time through nested cyclical structures rather than linear progression [13], uses stratified polyphony where instruments operate at different temporal densities [14], and employs two principal pentatonic tuning systems (pelog and slendro) with distinctive interval distributions [15, 16]. These featurescyclicity, multi-scale hierarchy, and non-uniform interval structuremap naturally onto the dynamical properties of ENSO. 1 Indonesias geographic position at the nexus of Pacific and Indian Ocean interactions makes it among the most ENSO-sensitive regions on Earth [1]. Strong El Nino events produce severe drought and forest fires; La Nina episodes bring catastrophic flooding, particularly across Java [1]. The Javanese gamelan tradition, developed over more than millennium on this same island, thus provides both geographic rationale and structural resonance for encoding ENSO dynamics. In this study, we map ENSO variability through gamelan tuning systems into audio and ask what dynamical signatures survive the transformation. We construct phase space representations of the sonified output and apply recurrence-based diagnostics from nonlinear time series analysis [17, 18] to characterize the resulting acoustic trajectories. The work shows that the two Javanese scales produce sonification variants with quantifiably different phase space geometries, and that trajectory analysis in normalized brightness-energy coordinates can systematically distinguish sonification designs from dynamical systems perspective. We have not conducted perceptual experiments and make no claims about communicative effectivenessthe contribution here is methodological."

Here θi is the SST anomaly at month i, θ the mean, σ the standard deviation, and the total observations. Temporal persistencea defining feature of ENSOs ocean-thermal inertiawas assessed through the lagautocorrelation ρ1 = (cid:80)N 1 i=1 (θi θ)(θi+1 θ) i=1(θi θ)2 (cid:80)N . (3) ENSO episodes were identified using operational criteria [2]: periods of at least three consecutive months with anomalies +0.5C (El Nino) or 0.5C (La Nina). Rate-of-change statistics from first-order differences θi = θi+1 θi characterize the typical and extreme rates of ENSO state evolution. All computations used NumPy [22] and SciPy [23]. We frame sonification as structured mapping : from the ENSO state space to an acoustic parameter space Y. The central question is what properties of the source dynamics survive the transformation. We implemented parameter-mapping sonification [7, 24] using two Javanese pentatonic scales. The pelog scale uses intervals Φpelog = {0, 1, 3, 7, 8} semitones (approximating CDEGA), while the slendro scale uses Φslendro = {0, 2, 3, 7, 9} (CDEGA) [16, 15]. Both have cardinality Φ = 5, but their interval distributions differ: pelog features unequal spacing (1, 2, 4, 1 semitones between successive degrees) while slendro is more uniform (2, 1, 4, 2). This structural difference constitutes the primary independent variable in our design. The mapping : {0, . . . , 127} transforms anomalies θ(t) [3, 3]C to MIDI note numbers through normalization and quantization: θ(t) + 3 6 ψ(t) = ξ(t) Nsteps, Nsteps = Φ noct 1 = 9, [0, 1], ξ(t) = where noct = 2 octaves yields 10 discrete pitch levels. Quantization employs rounding [25]: Decomposition into octave offset and scale degree via modular arithmetic gives o(t) = s(t)/Φ , d(t) = s(t) mod Φ, s(t) = ψ(t) + 0.5 {0, 1, . . . , 9}. and the MIDI note number is (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) ν(t) = 60 + 12 o(t) + Φd(t), where 60 corresponds to middle C. This establishes monotonic map: warm anomalies produce higher pitches, preserving ordinal structure. 2 To encode both state magnitude and evolution rateeffectively projecting phase space information into single audio parameterMIDI velocity is computed as v(t) = clip(80 + 20θ(t) + 30 θ(t) , 40, 127) , (9) where clip(x, a, b) = max(a, min(x, b)) and θ(t) = θ(t) θ(t 1). The weighting of the rate term (β2 = 30) above the magnitude term (β1 = 20) makes rapid ENSO transitions perceptually salient. ENSO variability spans multiple timescales, from intraseasonal oscillations to decadal modulation. To capture this hierarchy, we computed moving averages at window sizes ω Ω = {3, 12, 24, 36} months: θω(t) = 1 ω ω1 (cid:88) θ(t k), (10) k=0 equivalent to low-pass filtering with frequency response H(ω; ) = sin(πf ω)/[ω sin(πf )] [25]. Each scale was assigned to separate MIDI track, creating polyphonic textures analogous to gamelans stratified instrumental layers where different instruments elaborate the same melodic skeleton at different temporal densities [16, 14]. We generated eight sonification variants Si,j indexed by scale type {pelog, slendro} and composition mode j: Layered : all four temporal scales play simultaneously with note durations proportional to window size (δω = α ω/12, where α = 1.2 for pelog, 1.0 for slendro). This creates dense polyphonic textures with temporal overlap. Alternating: round-robin scheme activates one temporal scale per time step (ωk = Ω[t mod 4]), presenting each scale in isolation and introducing forced periodicity in the acoustic output. Melodic: the 12-month average serves as primary voice with the 24-month average as accompaniment at reduced velocity, mimicking gamelan balungan (skeletal melody) elaboration [16]. Spectral : Welch periodogram analysis [26] of the full time series identifies dominant spectral peaks using Hann window [27] with 50% overlap. The relative amplitudes of the top five peaks, normalized to unit sum, weight separate harmonic tracksencoding ENSOs frequency-domain structure into timbre. All MIDI sequences used tempo = 120 BPM and resolution tMIDI = 0.5 beats/month, yielding total duration = tMIDI/T 60 7.75 minutes. MIDI files were rendered to WAV at fs = 44.1 kHz using FluidSynth [28] with the FluidR3 GM SoundFont. The MIDIUtil library [29] handled MIDI generation. We extracted time-series of perceptually relevant features from rendered WAV files using Librosa [30] with hop length = 1024 and frame length = 2048 samples at fs = 22,050 Hz (resolutions 46.4 ms and 92.9 ms). These parameters balance the time-frequency uncertainty principle [31]. The spectral centroid (perceptual brightness) at frame is defined as the frequency-domain center of mass [32]: where X[k, m] is the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), [k] = kfs/L, and the magnitude operator. The RMS energy (perceptual intensity) is [33]: C[m] = (cid:80)L/2 k=0 [k] X[k, m] (cid:80)L/2 k=0 X[k, m] , (11) E[m] = (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116) 1 L1 (cid:88) n= x2[mH + n]. (12) Additional descriptors included zero-crossing rate (ZCR) for high-frequency content [34], spectral rolloff at α = 85% [35], spectral bandwidth [36], and mel-scaled spectral flux for timbral variability [37, 38]. For crossmode comparison, we applied global normalization using pooled 1st/99th percentiles: Cnorm[m] = C[m] Cmin Cmax Cmin , Enorm[m] = E[m] Emax , (13) clipped to [0, 1]. Temporal smoothing with 20-frame moving average reduced high-frequency noise [41]. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis), linear trend analysis, and lag-1 autocorrelation [39, 40] characterized each feature trajectory. The core analytical framework treats each sonification as dynamical trajectory in two-dimensional acoustic state space. We define the state vector (cid:21) (cid:20) Cnorm(m) Enorm(m) where tildes denote smoothed, normalized features. This choice of coordinates has natural interpretation: spectral centroid (brightness) correlates with the temperature of the spectral content, while RMS energy captures the intensity of the signal. The trajectory {Γ(m)}M m=1 traces how the sonification evolves through coupled brightness-energy dynamics. [0, 1]2, Γ(m) = (14) We draw on nonlinear dynamics and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) [43, 17, 18] to characterize these trajectories through the following metrics. The convex hull area = Area(H), computed via the QuickHull algorithm [44, 45], quantifies the region of brightness-energy space explored. Larger indicates diverse acoustic states; smaller values indicate confinement to restricted parameter regions [46]. The total Euclidean distance traversed, = 1 (cid:88) m=1 Γ(m + 1) Γ(m)2, (15) measures cumulative variation in coupled brightness-energy characteristics [47]. The ratio η = A/L captures how efficiently the trajectory covers its accessible phase space. High η indicates direct transitions between acoustic states; low values indicate meandering through redundant regions [18]. The temporal mean position Γ = 1 (cid:80) Γ(m) localizes the average acoustic state; the component-wise standard deviations σC and σE quantify dispersion around this centroid. The Pearson correlation ρCE between brightness and energy dimensions [42] reveals whether these acoustic axes vary in phase (ρ > 0), anti-phase (ρ < 0), or independently (ρ 0). The sign of this coupling constitutes dynamical fingerprint of the interaction between scale structure and mapping algorithm. To quantify quasi-periodicity, we compute the revisit ratethe fraction of trajectory point pairs returning within threshold distance ϵ = 0.05: Rϵ ="

The threshold was chosen to balance sensitivity against noise robustness [48]. Systematic subsampling (every 10th frame) reduced computational cost from O(M 2) to O((M/10)2) while preserving temporal structure given the 20-frame smoothing window. All trajectory metrics were computed using NumPy [22] and SciPy [23].

Acoustic features extracted from the eight sonification variants showed systematic differentiation across both scale families and composition modes  (Table 1)  . Mean spectral centroid ranged from 809 Hz (pelog melodic) to 1,863 Hz (slendro layered). The slendro family produced consistently higher brightness values across all composition modesa consequence of its more uniform interval spacing distributing pitch content across wider spectral range. Mean RMS energy varied from 0.008 (slendro melodic) to 0.022 (slendro layered), with layered modes exhibiting highest intensities regardless of scale family, consistent with their polyphonic texture.

Key patterns include: layered modes maintained relatively stable brightness with high-frequency fluctuations; alternating modes showed sustained oscillations reflecting the forced round-robin periodicity; melodic modes exhibited the most constrained ranges; and spectral modes displayed complex multi-scale variation. The slendro layered mode occupied consistently higher frequency space than any pelog variant.

The lower coefficient of variation in slendro indicates more stable relative brightness despite higher absolute values. All modes showed lag-1 autocorrelation exceeding 0.958 for brightness and 0.981 for energy, indicating highly persistent feature evolution that parallels the strong persistence (ρ1 = 0.926) of the input ENSO signal.

The round-robin composition strategy introduces period-4 forcing in acoustic space, creating more recurrent trajectory effectively amplifying the quasi-periodic character of the ENSO input. Layered polyphony, by superposing all temporal scales simultaneously, produces higher-dimensional acoustic signal that projects into the 2D brightness-energy plane as less recurrent, more space-filling trajectory. This distinction between lowrecurrence/high-area (layered) and high-recurrence/low-area (alternating) trajectories parallels the classic distinction between space-filling and periodic orbits in dynamical systems [3]. Brightness-energy coupling: The pelog family showed predominantly strong negative correlations (ρCE = 0.558, especially 0.790 in alternating mode), indicating that brightness and energy vary in anti-phase. The slendro family showed weak mean correlation (ρCE = 0.074), with layered mode uniquely exhibiting positive coupling (+0.317). This bifurcation in coupling regime between scale families constitutes an emergent property of the interaction between interval structure and the sonification mappingneither the input data nor the mapping algorithm alone determines the sign of the correlation. Scale-family separation: Aggregating by family, pelog modes averaged = 0.376, = 131, Rϵ = 0.176; slendro averaged = 0.337, = 169, Rϵ = 0.187. The slendro family thus produces longer trajectories with marginally higher recurrence rates but covering less phase space areaa more wandering but revisiting dynamic compared to pelogs expansive but less recurrent character."

The quasi-periodic character of ENSO maps to nonzero revisit rates in the acoustic phase space, though the specific recurrence structure depends heavily on composition mode. The ENSO distributions positive skewness (γ1 = 0.474) is not directly preserved in brightness distributions, which show variable skewness including both positive and negative valuesan expected consequence of the nonlinear pitch-mapping function. Full characterization of information transfer through the sonification pipeline would require mutual information estimation between input and output signals, an important direction for future work. The systematic trends we observeincreasing brightness and decreasing energy over the composition duration represent an artifact of temporal compression rather than preserved ENSO property. The 155-year record compressed to 7.75 minutes may induce non-stationary acoustic features through synthesis-engine effects unrelated to the input data. Prior work demonstrates that data density significantly affects auditory comprehension [49], suggesting this compression ratio warrants systematic optimization. 12 The striking bifurcation in brightness-energy coupling between scale familiesstrong anti-phase in pelog versus near-independence in slendrois an emergent property that arises from the interaction between the interval structure and the parameter-mapping algorithm. The pelog intervals {0, 1, 3, 7, 8} produce clustered pitch distributions where moving to higher scale degrees (brighter spectral content) concentrates spectral energy differently than the more distributed slendro intervals {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}. This finding has implications beyond our specific application: it demonstrates that the choice of musical scale is not merely aesthetic but introduces structural constraints on the dynamical properties of sonified output. Music itself has long been understood as exhibiting complex systems properties. Voss and Clarkes foundational observation that pitch and loudness fluctuations in music display 1/f spectral scaling [11] established that musical signals occupy regime between uncorrelated randomness and perfectly periodic orderexactly the regime characteristic of many natural complex systems including ENSO. Our gamelan-mapped ENSO sonifications inherit complexity from both the source signal and the musical framework, and the phase space analysis provides tools for disentangling these contributions. The choice of gamelan is not incidental to the complex systems framing. Gamelans stratified polyphony where instruments elaborate common melodic skeleton at different temporal densities [16, 14]is itself multi-scale hierarchical system. The nested cyclical time organization [13] produces temporal structures fundamentally different from the linear-progressive organization of Western music. Our multi-scale decomposition (ω {3, 12, 24, 36} months) maps naturally onto this hierarchical structure, with shorter windows capturing fast fluctuations and longer windows isolating slower dynamicsa temporal separation analogous to how different gamelan instruments relate to the colotomic cycle. However, our implementation involves significant simplifications. The 12-tone equal temperament approximation discards the microtonal embat that makes each gamelan set unique [15]. General MIDI synthesis lacks the timbral characteristics of bronze metallophone instruments achievable through specialized techniques [51]. The pathet modal system, which governs temporal progression and carries affective meaning in traditional practice [50], is not incorporated. Most critically, we have not engaged with Indonesian communities to assess cultural resonanceeffective communication requires design conscious of audience relationship to content [52]. Several limitations constrain this work. The phase space analysis characterizes the sonification output, not the fidelity of the data-to-sound mapping. Metrics like mutual information or transfer entropy between input and output would strengthen the dynamical systems analysis. Full RQAincluding determinism, laminarity, and longest diagonal line measures [17, 18]would provide richer dynamical characterization than our simplified recurrence rate. The threshold ϵ = 0.05 was fixed rather than optimized systematically. The 10-level pitch quantization (0.6C resolution) is coarse, potentially discarding meaningful climate variability. Most critically, we lack perceptual validation. Quantitative acoustic characterization cannot substitute for listener studies assessing pattern recognition, event identification, or data comprehension [8, 53]. Musical complexity may hinder rather than help engagement [54]. We contribute the analytical framework for evaluating sonification designs; the communicative effectiveness question remains open. Future work should address these gaps through information-theoretic measures of mapping fidelity, full RQA with systematic embedding parameter selection, perceptual experiments comparing composition modes, and extension to multivariate ENSO representations mapping SST patterns, atmospheric pressure, and thermocline depth to gamelans multi-layered instrumental architecture."

The key findings are: (1) slendro modes generate consistently higher spectral\ncentroids than pelog, reflecting the influence of interval structure on spectral properties; (2) layered composi-\ntions explore broader phase space with lower recurrence, while alternating modes exhibit the highest trajectory\nrevisit rates, paralleling the distinction between space-filling and periodic orbits; (3) the two scale families in-\nduce qualitatively different coupling regimes between brightness and energy dimensions, an emergent property\nof the scale-mapping interaction; and (4) multi-scale temporal decomposition encodes ENSO variability across\nsubseasonal to decadal timescales, leveraging gamelan’s inherent hierarchical temporal structure. These results\nestablish that phase space trajectory analysis provides geometric tools for systematic comparison of sonifica-\ntion designs within a complex systems framework, and that culturally-grounded musical systems can serve as\nstructured dynamical mappings between climate variability and auditory perception.",
