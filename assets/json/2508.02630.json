            "content": "Autonomous AI agents are poised to make shopping decisions for millions of consumers, reshaping the e-commerce ecosystem [14, 18, 33, 50]. new generation of computer-use systems such as OpenAIs Operator (automating grocery orders, form filling, flight booking) [29, 37] and Google DeepMinds Project Mariner (large-scale multi-tab shopping) [16, 55]promises to replace manual browsing with autonomous procurement. Industry leaders are already signaling strategic disruption; Walmarts CTO urges preparedness for third-party agents that circumvent traditional merchandising and advertising cues [6]. Today, consumers still interact with platforms directly. In the near future they may instead issue short prompt to personalized AI agent (augmented with purchase history and preferences), which then navigates, evaluates, and purchases with minimal human oversight (see Figure 5 in Appendix A). Such agents have the potential to significantly reduce search frictions for customers. In doing so, agents can systematically scan broader assortments than humans, potentially diluting the influence of classical monetization levers that platforms have, such as product rankings and ad placements. Parallel developments are also likely on the seller side: AI listing and pricing agents that tune product listings in anticipation of buyer-agent behavior. This shift foreshadows reconfigured e-commerce ecosystem and raises new design, strategy, and regulatory questions. With this shift upon us, and as AI agents start purchasing and making decisions on our behalf, we ask the following fundamental question: what is our AI agent buying and why? More concretely, we investigate various layers of questions. 1. Rational Behavior. Do agents satisfy basic instruction following and simple economic dominance tests? 2. Product Market Shares. What are product market shares when purchases are fully mediated by AI agents, and how do such market shares vary across AI agents? 3. Choice Behavior and Biases. How do AI agents respond to observable attributes (price, rating, reviews, text) and platform levers (position, promotions, sponsorship)? 4. Interaction between Buyer and Seller Agents. How might outcomes change when sellers and/or marketplace platforms deploy their own optimizing AI agents? The first question concerns minimum viability: without elementary rationality, higher-order design or policy levers may be moot (cf. the emphasis on baseline competence in [46]). The second and third probe in-the-wild behaviors. The fourth anticipates the strategic dynamics between mediated demand and algorithmic supply responses. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. 2 ACES framework. We develop ACES (Agentic e-CommercE Simulator): (i) provider-agnostic VLM shopping agent and (ii) fully programmable mock e-commerce application (mock-app; see Figure 6). This framework enables control and randomization of page layout, product order, prices, ratings, reviews, and promotional / sponsored badges. This provides realistic shopping environment while preserving experimental control for causal attribution of how platform levers and listing attributes steer AI agents purchase decisions. Market shares under delegation. Using ACES, we study product selection shares when an assortment of eight products are presented with randomized product positions. We evaluate three model families (Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and treat selection frequencies as proxy for market share in fully delegated world. We observe the following. (i) Model heterogeneity. Different AI models induce very distinct market shares for the same assortment of products. For example, for the fitness watch category, Claude Sonnet 4 selects the Fitbit Inspire model 45%, while GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Flash select it only about 25% of the time (see Figure 1). (ii) Concentration risk. For some categories, the market shares concentrate on few select products and some brands are never selected (e.g., Amazon Basics and Arrow in the case of staplers; see Figure 1), raising questions about possible market dominance patterns induced by agent selection, which may suppress intrinsic consumer preference dispersion. Baseline rationality. We test two basic requirements: (i) instruction following select the only product matching an explicit attribute (e.g., color, within budget); (ii) economic rationalityselect the unique best product when product that dominates all others exists. We test this by controlling the attributes of the various listings and constructing randomized scenarios with each having only one listing satisfying the query. We find that performance is heterogeneous across models and tasks. In one of the price-based rationality tests, we construct scenario with all listings being identical except for one listing having lower price. Here, even state of the art models (GPT4.1) can register failure rates exceeding 9%. The failure rate tends to decrease with the increase in price difference. In rating dominance tests, all listings are identical except that one listing has an average rating which is higher by 0.1. We see significant heterogeneity in performance, with some models registering no failures (Gemini 2.0 Flash) and others registering up to 71.7% failures (GPT-4o, on which OpenAI Operator is built). However with GPT-4.1, this fail rate comes down to 16.0%, supporting the insight that failures reduce with more advanced models. These findings imply consumers delegating purchases may sometimes pay more or obtain lower-rated products, and sellers cannot rely on modest price cuts or rating advantages to guarantee being selected by agents. 3 Figure 1: Market share of fitness watches (left) and staplers (right) with different AI agents. Choice Behavior and Biases. To systematically understand how the AI agents trade off between different product attributes and the impact of different platform levers like rankings and promotions, we run randomized controlled trials where we randomly permute the position of the products, add sponsorship, endorsement or scarcity tags and perturb product attributes like price, average rating and number of reviews. We fit conditional logit model [35] to understand the sensitivity of AI agents to different attributes. AI agents react positively to higher average ratings, and also to larger number of ratings, and are sensitive to price though perhaps less so than one might expect. This behavior is qualitatively similar with what one would expect from humans, but sensitivities differ significantly across models. We also observe that everything else being equal, the position can significantly affect the selection of product by AI agents. Quite strikingly, this position bias leads to very large changes in the selection rate, and the type of bias differs widely across models. These findings highlight that the rise of AI agents might significantly affect market demand, and also lead platforms to adjust the type of levers they use. Toward the meta game: seller response. We next test how could sellers respond to the deployment of AI agents and what impact may such response have. To do so, we provide an AI agent representing seller information on product attributes and current market shares, and prompt it to improve the description of the product it represents. We find the impact of AI-generated product descriptions to be heterogeneous. In 75% of the cases, it does not lead to statistically different 4 sales levels, but quite strikingly, in 25% of the cases, single iteration of this process leads to dramatic increase in the market share of the focal product. These findings suggest that strategic dynamics will emerge from the interaction between sellers, platforms, and AI agents representing buyers, which are both substantial and intricate. Our work connects to extensive research into computer-use agents and benchmarks [11, 27, 51, 58] including for e-commerce environments [9, 21, 24, 32, 40, 54]. While most benchmarks for AI agents evaluate end-to-end task completion, our contribution is to isolate the critical choice step in agent shopping through the controllable ACES sandbox. This facilitates the first agentcentric, causal evaluation of how AI shoppers respond to product attributes and platform levers like product positions and promotional badges, complementing existing studies on human consumers [31, 48]. We provide more comprehensive literature review in Appendix B. Our results have significant implications for various stakeholders in the new e-commerce ecosystemcustomers, sellers, platform designers and regulatorswhich will be mediated by AI agents. We quantify AI shopping agent behavior and shed light on situations in which customers can and cannot rely on their AI shopping assistant. Furthermore, the results raise pertinent questions such as: How can sellers prepare themselves for more customers shopping via their AI assistants? Will Marketing and Sales efforts come to rely heavily on sandbox environments like ACES to optimize listings and campaigns? How might platforms monetize in future dominated by AI shopping assistants, e.g., can they offer listing optimization as service to sellers? To what extent will AI-powered consumer agents aggregate and exercise market power, and what are the implications for market efficiency and consumer welfare?"

            "content": "ACES (Agentic e-CommercE Simulator) comprises of: (i) provider-agnostic browser-use agent that combines vision language model (VLM) of choice with tool usage to observe and act on webpages, and (ii) fully controllable mock e-commerce site (mock-app) that renders product listings. The VLM agent is implemented using the LangChain library [7] and the Selenium browser-driver [44]. The mock-app is lightweight storefront with search that returns listings from our pre-specified product universe. Veni: Opens the brower and loads the mock-app page Vidi: Search for the product and take screenshot Emi: Query the VLM; declares intent; process terminates. Figure 2: Workflow of AI agent interacting with online platform. Instead of simulating the entire end-to-end shopping journey, which can consist of many back and forths between different options and reading different reviews, we simulate streamlined three step interaction, which we call Veni, Vidi, Emi1 in short (see Figure 2): 1. the AI agent opens browser (via Selenium) and loads the mock-app landing page (Veni), 2. provides the productcategory (e.g., fitness watch, stapler, etc.) being evaluated then captures screenshot of the returned catalog of products (Vidi), 3. query vision-language model (VLM) (with the screenshot and the user prompt) and records the VLMs intended selection; treating it as the purchase and the episode terminates (Emi). Our results page displays an eight-product assortment in fixed 24 grid (see Figure 6). There are no product-detail pages; all information needed to choose is visible in the search results. While this omits aspects of full-funnel shopping, it provides first-order approximation of selection behavior. We intentionally constrain the search-action space to single page with eight items and single tool call to enable clean measurement of choice behavior. This design (i) prevents behavioral looping by grounding the agent in fixed UI context; (ii) standardizes tool use across model families and avoids coordinate-based errors; (iii) restricts navigation complexity by eliminating multi-page exploration; and (iv) isolates core trade-offs we aim to study. As VLM technology matures and token costs decline, richer multi-page interactions can be incorporated. Finally, we do not personalize agents and use single generic prompt (see below) to isolate baseline behavior. Over-specifying preferences would effectively pre-solve the very search task these agents are designed to perform, obscuring autonomous decision-making and the influence of platform levers. In addition, prompt engineering is unbounded: more instructions can be layered on, producing brittle, hand-crafted policies whose biases may shift as models are updated and deployed. Our objective in this work is to measure the base behavior. 1It is Latin for came, saw, bought 6 Default Prompt Template for AI Buyer You are personal shopping assistant helping someone find good {query}.

The experiments are designed in manner such that there is objectively only single product that satisfies the requirements of the test. Instruction Following Experiments. We consider three types of instruction following tasks: (i) choose product within specified budget, (ii) choose the product of specified color and (iii) choose specified brand. For each of the tasks, we select few product categories and explicitly prompt the AI agent to align with the stated preferences by replacing specific substring in the default prompt. For each task and its chosen product categories, we run 50 experiments in which the position of the products are randomly shuffled. For further details about the experiment setup, refer to Appendix C.1.1. Basic Rationality Experiments. We also test agents ability to select an optimal product, when the prompt does not specify which attribute to prioritize. To do so, we examine, in fully controlled setting, whether agents select the option that maximizes user utility when alternatives differ only along single ordered attribute. We perform two types of tests: (a) price-based and (b) rating-based tests where all product attributes are the same except for prices and ratings respectively. This setup therefore gauges whether the agent can infer sensible utility ranking on 7 its own. An economically rational AI agent which aims to maximize user utility must choose the product with the lowest price or the highest rating given that all the other attributes are identical. We explicitly avoid instructing the models to prioritize specific attribute because real-world preferences are multi-dimensional: customers routinely trade off price, ratings, and other product features.

We then replace the original description with the AI-recommended version and rerun the same 200 trialsagain shuffling only on-page positionsto measure how the revised description alters purchase shares across categories.

The figure depicts the selection rate of the same product across different positions for three AI agents. Ranking mattersand how it matters is highly model-dependent. All three models display statistically significant sensitivity to where product appears on the page. Holding all attributes constant, each model assigns clear premium to the top row relative to the bottom row. However, the horizontal (column) patterns vary sharply. GPT-4.1 strongly favors the first column; Claude Sonnet 4, in contrast, largely ignores the first column and prefers the two middle columns; and Gemini 2.5 Flash tilts toward the third column, while columns one and two are comparatively disfavored. Taken together, these patterns imply different heat maps of positional utility. For illustration, in Figure 3, we show the selection probability of the same product at different positions using the estimates in Table 1. We obtain these selection rates using (3.2) and setting all attributes except for the position to be same across the eight identical products. The position can lead to drastic changes in selection rates. For example, for Claude Sonnet 4, moving product from the bottom right corner (where it is selected 4.5%) to the top row in the second or third column leads to 5-fold increase in selection rate! Interestingly, the top left corner would only yield half of that increase. Sponsored tags hurt sales while Platform Endorsement substantially increases selection chances. Across all three frontier models, the three badgessponsored, overall pick, and scarcityshift choices in the same qualitative direction. sponsored tag reduces the likelihood of selection (a product with baseline selection probability of 10% falls to 8.9% for Claude Sonnet 4, 8.0% for GPT-4.1, and 7.9% for Gemini 2.5 Flash), the scarcity tag effect is weakly negative or statistically indistinguishable from zero, whereas an overall pick endorsement delivers large positive lift, raising the same baseline to 24.3%, 19.9%, and 42.6%, respectively. Because badge assignment is fully randomized, these are causal effects, not artifacts of latent product quality. The negative impact of the sponsored tag suggests that agents discount advertising, while the strong positive response to overall pick implies that platform endorsements are treated as credible signalsechoing the human-buyer evidence in [31]. Importantly, our estimates do not imply that sponsored ads are necessarily harmful for sellers: sponsored ads secure premium placementfront-page or top-row exposurethat seller might not attain organically. Our findings should therefore be interpreted 11 conditionally: given fixed position, the mere presence of the sponsored tag lowers an agents selection probability. Sponsored ads thus buy attention through placement but induce credibility cost, highlighting trade-off that platform designers and sellers must weigh. Directional agreement on product attributes and human-like behavior. All three models assign negative weight to price and positive weight to ratings and the number of reviews. Directionally, this mirrors what rational human shopper would do: prefer cheaper, betterrated, and more widely reviewed products. Quantitatively, however, the sensitivities are heterogeneous across models. For example, consider product with baseline selection probability of 10%, an +0.1 increase in rating lifts the probability to 15.4%, 20.3% and 16.0% with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4. and Gemini 2.5 Flash, respectively. Strong response to position, ratings and tags like Overall Pick. We investigate by how much can seller increase the price of their product (while keeping the latent utility governing user choice unchanged), if they could (i) move from the second row to the first row, (ii) get an Overall Pick endorsement from the platform, (iii) increase their rating by +0.1, or (iv) double the number of reviews? Understanding these trade-offs are important not only for the sellers but also for platform operators since many of them operate via seller commissions. The results in Table 7 in Appendix D.3 summarize how different models trade-off these attributes. For Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4.1, moving from the second to the first row is worth roughly doubling of price, whereas for Gemini 2.5 Flash the same move is worth only about +17%. The Overall Pick tag produces very large liftse.g., +92% for Claude Sonnet 4, +65% for GPT-4.1 and +138% price headroom for Gemini 2.5 Flash. An increment of +0.1 in ratings, allows seller to increase their price by quarter with Gemini 2.5 Flash and third with Claude Sonnet 4 while this more than doubles to 67% with GPT-4.1. Finally, doubling of reviews, allows 19%, 37% and 17% increase in price with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Flash respectively."

Note that the description of only one product in each category is changed based on the recommendation of the seller AI agent. yields no statistically significant change in market share. In the remaining 25% cases, one-shot modification produces large gains: for Claude Sonnet 4 we observe +9.0% in iPhone 16 Pro Cover and +15.4% in toilet paper; for GPT-4.1, +21.8% in mousepad and +16.3% in office lamp; and for Gemini 2.5 Flash, +23.6% in iPhone 16 Pro Cover, and +9.0% in toothpaste. Firms typically invest heavily in marketing and may not expect double digit increases from minor edits, yet our results indicate that, in the presence of AI-mediated demand, targeted description modifications alone may materially shift selection shares. We emphasize that this is single-pass intervention; iterative optimization or simultaneous adoption by multiple sellers could amplify or dampen these effects and would be interesting to explore in future work."

Platforms. First, the present study has illustrated that position biases are strong and vary widely across AI models. For product ranking, platforms may need to adapt their layout and ranking systems to account for this. We contend that such biases suggest compelling case for the implementation of agent-specific storefronts operating on standardized protocol, such as the Model 13 Context Protocol [2]. Second, traditional monetization levers for platforms may be rendered ineffective by AI shoppers. Instead, new levers, such as dynamically optimizing product titles and images on behalf of sellers, could become more powerful tools for platforms to boost sales. Third, platforms (and regulators) should be monitor the impact of AI assisted shopping on market efficiency and consumer welfare. Brands and Sellers. Given the volatility in market share caused by differences between model providers, sellers will need to continuously adapt their product listings to be in the AI agent consideration sets. New AI model releases as well as model updates may also lead to significant changes in AI agent purchase behavior. In Appendix E, we document significant changes in market shares and position biases when switching from Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview to Gemini 2.5 Flash. new category of seller-side AI agent companies is likely to emerge, aiming to assist sellers in monitoring and navigating, potentially in real time, this increasingly dynamic market. Consumers/Buyers. As consumers delegate purchasing decisions to AI agents, search frictions will dramatically decrease, but as we documented, there may be some risks of irrational or wrong purchases. There is growing need to educate consumers about the differing preferences and behaviors of various buying agents. These behavioral discrepancies underscore the importance of developing new buyer-side AI agents that better align decisions with user preferences. AI shopping agent developers and Regulators. AI shopping assistants should undergo standard evaluations along the lines of ACES and publish their scores. To the extent this doesnt happen organically, regulators should step in to require this. Next, the largest platforms may not organically provide standardized protocol for AI shopping agentsdespite the biases and inefficiency resulting from AI assistants browsing webpagese.g., to protect their ability to monetize via sponsored products. If so, we argue that this will be another opportunity for regulators to put appropriate requirements in place."

The ACES framework we develop is step in developing systematic diagnostic tools for agentic e-commerce. We believe that developing such sandbox environments will be critical for all players in the ecosystem, and that developing suite of metrics for agents will be helpful in measuring possible weaknesses and technological progress. There are various concrete avenues for research including building better predictive models of AI agents choices, further understanding the drivers of their decision making, mechanistic interpretability of models, and expanding the scope of measurement to the entire purchasing journey to (not just the Veni, Vidi, 14 Emi model in this paper) and the impact of prompts. It would also be interesting to explore other candidate drivers of choice, such as the images associated with the products, and webpage designs. Operating modes. We have advocated for platforms to provide standardized protocol for AI shopping agents. Will agents leveraging such protocol suffer from similar biases and heterogeneous behavior? How to design such protocol to maximize market performance? Strategic Interactions. The present study suggests that buyers, sellers and platforms will have significant incentives to leverage AI agents. Studying the strategic interactions among players, how these may differ in an AI-mediated world, possible efficiency gains and unintended consequences, is an exciting avenue for future research. AI agents vs. human buyers. natural academic question that emerges is how do AI agents compare to human buyers? In addition, as AI agents are deployed at scale, the question will be whether human preferences will be indirectly shaped over time by the choices of the AI agents, and whether this effect will be stronger than that of recommendation algorithms. Interactive AI assistance. AI buying agents can benefit from some degree of interactiveness for preference elicitation, towards choices that may better align with user preferences. The design and optimization of such dynamic interactions is an exciting direction."

            "title": "A ACES Framework",
            "content": "We envision an agentic e-commerce workflow in which AI assistants transact on behalf of consumers. These agents are simply VLM (or LLM) given the ability to interact with the external world through tools [1, 39, 43]. These agents can be personalized (for example, through purchase histories) andinstead of users searching and buying themselvesexecute the end-to-end journey: (i) open browser, (ii) visit retailers site, (iii) issue query, (iv) parse and navigate product listings using tool use (scrolling, clicking, screenshotting, etc.), and (v) complete checkout. Figure 5 illustrates this AI shopping agent in operation. A.1 Business Goal & Context The ACES frameworks primary purpose to simulate the interaction depicted by Figure 5. This shopping agent workflow follows common design pattern that is well-evaluated in the literature [32, 54], and is already productized [1, 22, 29, 36, 37, 55]. The shopping agent workflow employed: 1. Opens browser 2. Navigates to the target platform 3. Searches for product 4. Captures screenshot 5. Selects product using the provided tool ACES seeks to collapse an agents journey to the linear sequence stated above, while accurately emulating production-ready shopping agent, interacting with the underlying VLM models in 21 Figure 5: AI agentic workflow for seamless shopping. The user delegates shopping to an AI agent and the AI agent autonomously navigates the platform website with the help of tool use. uniform manner, and ensuring that the choice behaviors of the model are accessible and measurable. Unlike many real-world examples such as [1, 38] that employ external modules to increase capabilities in arbitrary tasks, ACES seeks to leave the VLM unassisted to more accurately approximate outcomes. A.2 High-level Architecture & Approach Given the complexity of employing VLM agents in the shopping task, ACES is designed with the following principles: Reusability Stakeholders, future researchers, and engineers might look to ACES for future research. Adapting the mock-app, providing new experiments, and extending the agent has been kept in mind. Provider/Model agnostic Using VLMs in the agent context raises 2 primary hurdles: the low-level code to interface with these VLMs is not the same; not all VLMs are designed to interact with external environments as signaled by the diverging implementations of [22, 55]. We solve this by using LangChain [7] which provides single interface for interacting with VLMs, and collapsing the action space to single tool call. As byproduct, the code is rendered easily extensible. Observability Understanding results and debugging must have minimal dependencies on external frameworks. As such, the entire agent journey is saved to tree-like file hierarchy which can be easily inspected. 22 Cost & Efficiency To ensure efficiency, the framework includes the boilerplate code to utilize batch processing to allow experimentation to be run at high-throughput. To conduct experiments which model Figure 5, ACES is comprised of 3 top-level components agent, experiments, and sandboxeach responsible for different portions of the workflow, and who interact through clearly defined interfaces. The majority of the code is contained within experiments which encapsulates the dataset generation and randomization, collection of the results, and batch processing. The shopping agent itself is defined within agent; and sandbox contains the mock-app. Figure 6: Mock-up app screen. The mock-app displays an assortment of eight products for each product category arranged in grid with two rows and four columns."

            "title": "B Related Literature",
            "content": "Our work connects to rich body of literature spanning computer-use agents, e-commerce systems, recommendation and ranking algorithms, behavioral biases in human decision-making, and recent advances in multi-modal AI agents. Across these threads, our contribution is to provide controlled, visual, and interactive sandbox that zooms in on the choice step (which product to buy) for AI shopping agents, and measures rationality and choice behavior via randomized page layouts, attributes, and badges. Although ACES resembles prior computer-use testbeds such as WebArena and VisualWebArena, our emphasis is different: rather than evaluating end-to-end web navigation, we focus on single critical stepselecting which product to buyto obtain finegrained view of agent choice behavior in shopping contexts [27, 58]. 23 Computer-Use Agents and Benchmarks. fast-growing body of work builds web and OSinteracting agents evaluated in realistic environments. WebArena introduces reproducible, longhorizon web tasks over functional sites (e.g., e-commerce, forums), with baseline agents achieving low end-to-end success relative to humans [58]. VisualWebArena extends to multimodal interfaces with images and forms [27]. Mind2Web targets generalist web agents across 137 real websites [11], and follow-ups examine grounding for GPT-4V as generalist web agent [57]. Beyond the browser, OSWorld provides real-computer environment (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) and documents large headroom between SOTA agents and humans [51]; Windows Agent Arena and AndroidWorld further expand to Windows and Android ecosystems [5, 34]. Work studying agentcomputer interfaces shows how UI design and tool affordances affect agent success (e.g., SWE-agent) [53]. Recent open-source GUI-agent frameworks such as UI-TARS and Agent S2 report architectural advances (e.g., GUI grounding, hierarchical planning) and improved benchmark performance [1, 56]. In light of the documented low end-to-end success rates on complex multi-step tasks, our framework intentionally constrains the interaction and isolates the choice problem so that we can study rational behavior and the influence of layout and badges without conflating failures from unrelated subroutines (e.g., brittle scrolling or app switching). Autonomous Shopping Agents and Multimodal Product Understanding. WebShop frames shopping as instruction-following in simulated web store, training agents with imitation and reinforcement learning [54]. More recent shopping evaluations include Shopping MMLU (text-based, multi-task retail skills) and DeepShop (deep research shopping agents with live navigation), as well as dialog-driven and domain-tuned LLMs for e-commerce such as eCeLLM and LiLiuM [9, 21, 24, 32, 40]. Vision-language product understanding models (e.g., PUMGPT) address attribute extraction and classification from images and text [52]. Our ACES sandbox complements these works by providing controllable setting with randomized listings and visual perturbations to test whether shopping agents exhibit instruction adherence and choice rationality, and to understand their choice behavior, in the presence of positions, promotions, and badges. Product Rankings, Platform Design, and Assortment Optimization. Empirical and theoretical work shows that positions and rankings can causally shape what consumers examine and buy. [48] provides experimental evidence on the causal impact of rankings on online search and purchases; [15] quantifies direct and interaction effects between ranking and ratings on consumer behavior and platform revenue. Our work is related to this line of research as we investigate the causal impact of rankings (positions) and product attributes on selection by an AI agent. There is related theoretical and empirical work modelling the consumers search process and developing platforms ranking algorithm [8, 12]. Our work also connects to long line of work on assortment optimization which takes customer/AI shopper behavior (as estimated by us) as an input, e.g., 24 see [10, 13, 17, 28]. Platform Endorsements and Badges. Digital platforms deploy badges such as Best Seller, Overall Pick, scarcity labels, and strike-through discounts. Recent empirical evidence suggests badges can meaningfully change clicks and add-to-cart probabilities [31]; complementary work studies badge longevity, uniformity, and bias across marketplaces, and the causal effects of badges in online communities [4, 23, 30]. Our framework provides, to our knowledge, the first agent-centric evaluation of whether and how multimodal shopping agents respond to such cues versus product attributes (price, rating, reviews). Personalization and Recommender Systems. Classical recommender systems and industrial practice highlight personalizations central role in e-commerce [42, 45]. Recent LLM personalization efforts create benchmarks and methods for tailoring responses to user-specific preferences [59] and dataset resources for digital-twin style behavioral modeling [47]. In this paper we do not personalize the agents; we deliberately use generic prompts to elicit baseline behavior that is not pre-solved by over-specifying the target item. Our results therefore characterize the unconditioned decision-making tendencies that platforms and regulators may encounter as autonomous agents are deployed prior to personalization. Algorithmic Delegation. Theoretical work on delegation studies how principal can design mechanisms for delegating to an agent whose incentives or information differ from those of the principal, and payments are not possible [3]. [26] show that appropriately constrained delegation can approximate efficient search despite misaligned incentives; [20] find benefits of delegating search to multiple agents; and [19] study the optimal design of algorithmic delegates to help the user under information asymmetry, given that certain task categories will be delegated to them by users while others will not. Our empirical results can be viewed as documenting the outcome of delegation to AI agents from leading providers in concrete market setting: given visual catalog, what do agents buy and why, and how do platform levers and product attributes translate into systematic selection patterns?"

For VLM evaluation, we consider the following models: Anthropics Claude Sonnet 3.5, 3.7, and 4; OpenAIs GPT-4o and GPT-4.1; and Google DeepMinds Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Flash. Notably, both OpenAIs GPT-4o and Google DeepMinds Gemini 2.0 Flash are directly productized as shopping agents through OpenAIs Operator [29, 37] and Googles Project Mariner [16, 55], respectively. Following the initial rationality checks across all models, we conduct our detailed analysis on the latest release from each provider, under the 25 assumption that older versions will be deprecated in favor of their successors in advanced applications. To maintain roughly uniform baseline of capability, we exclude reasoning models and explicit reasoning componentssuch as omitting the default reasoning tokens for Gemini 2.5 Flash and Anthropics Claude Sonnet 4, whereas OpenAIs GPT-4.1 does not support reasoning. Furthermore, reasoning models were excluded from our selection due to their higher latency, making them unfavorable in user-facing agentic tasks which require low latency inference [25, 41, 49]. Universe of Product Categories. On the platform side, we select eight product categories, fitness watch, iPhone 16 Pro cover, mousepad, office lamp, stapler, toilet paper, toothpaste, and washing machine chosen to represent mix of highand low-ticket items, to generalize across broad range of product types, and to include both well-known and niche brands. For each of the product categories, we choose eight representative products (found based on public information on the Amazon website) which form our assortment of products which we then display in 2 grid layout on our mock-app. C."

            "content": "We test the models for three types of instruction following tasks: (i) the ability to choose product within specified budget, (ii) choose specific color and (iii) choose specific brand. For each of the tasks, we selected two product categories summarized in Table 2. The tasks were specified in such way that there was unique product that satisfied the query.

In both, all products are identical except for price. In one setting (i) all price are equal, except for the price of one listing which is decreased 26 (a) Choose product within specified budget (b) Choose specified color Figure 7: Design of different types of instruction following rationality tests. The optimal choice is highlighted in the red bounding box. (c) Choose specified brand by α-fraction and in second setting (ii) we assign random prices to each of the listings drawn from normal distribution (µ, σ2) with mean µ and variance σ2. For (i), we consider α 27 {0.1, 0.05, 0.01} which corresponds to 10%, 5% and 1% discount in the prices with respect to the other prices respectively (see Figure 8a). For (ii), we set the mean µ as the average of the eight product prices in their respective category. For the variance, we consider σ = $0.3 (low variance; see Figure 8c) and σ = 0.2µ (high variance; see Figure 8e). C.1.3 Rating-Based Rationality Experiments We have three rating-based experiments: (i) the rating of one listing is increased by 0.1 (see Figure 8b), (ii) random ratings for the eight products with ratings ranging from 4.4 to 4.7 (low variance; see Figure 8d) and (iii) random ratings for the eight products with ratings ranging from 3.0 to 4.5 (high variance; see Figure 8f). Note that except for the ratings, all the other product attributes are the same. C.2 Choice Behavior and Biases To estimate the sensitivity of the AI agent to different platform levers, we create dataset with exogenous variation across number of variables associated with the products (see Table 3). Given these variations are exogenous to the inherent attractiveness of the products, they allow us to obtain causal estimates to the impact of different platform levers like position, tags and product attributes like price, rating and number of reviews. We also provide visualization of the exogenous variation of price, rating and number of reviews around their original value for few product categories in Figure 9. Figure 10 provides an example of different mock-app screens for two different experiment runs. Notice that the assortment of the eight products is the same across the two experiments. However the position of the eight products change across the two experiments along with their price, rating and number of reviews. Also notice that the Sponsored, Overall Pick and Only Remaining (scarcity) tags are assigned to different products across the two experiments. C.3 Seller Response to AI-assisted shopping In this section, we aim to design an experiment to measure the impact of seller-side AI agents recommendations for the product description when buyers use particular agent. To estimate the causal impact of the recommendation made by the AI seller agent, we have the following experimental setup. 1. Simulate the purchase behavior of the AI buying agent across different product categories. We run 200 experiment trials where we present the AI buying agent (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Flash) with eight products per category. The eight products are shuffled uniformly at random across the 200 experiments. Note that we only shuffle the position of the (a) 10% discount on one listing (b) +0.1 increase in rating of one listing (c) Random prices (with low variance) (d) Random ratings (with low variance) (e) Random prices (with high variance) (f) Random ratings (with high variance) Figure 8: Design of price and rating based rationality test. The optimal choice is highlighted in the red bounding box. products on the screen but do not change any of their other attributes like price, description, etc. 2. For each category, we select uniformly at random single product from the eight-product assortment. The selected product becomes the focal product/seller that optimizes its description via the AI seller agent. 3. Prompt the AI seller agent (e.g., GPT-4.1) to generate recommendations for the product description. We provide the AI seller agent screenshot of the platform with the eight products along with the features of the sellers product, some context and the sales data of competing sellers induced by the buying AI agent. The exact prompt is reproduced below. 29 Table 3: Randomized variations used to identify agents choice sensitivities. Ind. Variables"

Broadly speaking, we identified three types of explanations. Perceptual Limitations. The model treated all products as identical, failing to recognize differences in price or rating. This type of error was particularly prevalent when the difference was subtle, for e.g., in the case when the price of one listing was reduced by 1%. Unjustified Sub-optimality. The model recognized the optimal product (e.g., the cheapest or highest-rated) but still made sub-optimal choice without providing any specific justification for its decision. Dismissal with justification. The model acknowledged the optimal product but explicitly provided reason for not selecting it. These reasons often included: Prioritizing Standard Options. The model would state it chose the standard price/rating or the most common price point, indicating preference for typical values over slight deviations. Attributing difference to errors. The model sometimes dismissed the optimal option by attributing the observed difference to display error, temporary discount, an outdated listing, or pricing error on the platform. Perceived Insignificance. The model might justify its sub-optimal choice by stating the price difference was minimal or that there was no apparent/significant advantage or no functional difference compared to other options. D.3 Choice Behavior and Biases Understanding the trade-offs between position, tags and listing attributes. We fit conditional logit with the utility specification in (3.1). The estimates are provided in Table 1. We can use the estimates in Table 1, (3.1) and (3.2) to understand how the different models trade-off different attributes. For example, we can be interested in understanding how the choice probability changes if there is Sponsored tag or an Overall Pick tag or rating changes by 0.1. Lets say that the baseline selection probability of product is pj and assume that we change co-variate with coefficient βz by z. Let oj = pj/(1 pj) be the odd-ratio for product j, then the new selection probability j is given as (a) = exp(Uj) exp(βzz) k=i exp(Uk) + exp(Uj) exp(βzz) (cid:80) (b) = pj exp(βzz) 1 pj + pj exp(βzz) (c) = exp(βzz)oj 1 + exp(βzz)oj , 34 where (a) follows from (3.2), (b) follows by dividing numerator and denominator by (cid:80) and the fact that pj = exp(Uj)/ (cid:80) we can calculate how the probability will change if we change some covariate. exp(Uk) k=i exp(Uk) and (c) follows from the definition of oj. Using this, We can also obtain price-equivalent trade-offs: convenient way to compare levers is to ask: by how much can seller raise (or must cut) price to keep the utility constant when the seller adds (or loses) feature worth = βzz. Let say, we change the price by multiplicative factor of λ, i.e., = λP where is the original price of the product. Since we are keeping the utility constant, (cid:1). This allows to be get we have that βprice ln λ + βzz = 0, this implies that λ = exp (cid:0)βzz/βprice price-based exchange rate between different attributes. In Table 7, we present the price-equivalent results for different covariates. Table 7: Price-equivalent tradeoffs implied by the CL coefficients. Entries are approximate multiplicative changes in price that leave utility unchanged when the corresponding lever is added (top block) or removed/penalized (bottom block). Claude Sonnet 4 GPT-4.

In this case, we find that this rather innocuous looking change in the product description can significantly shift the market share. In Figure 12b, we plot the market share of different products for the mousepad category when using GPT-4.1 as the AI buying agent. We observe that there is statistically significant and large increase of 21.8% in the market share of the focal product Aothia. This comes at the expense of decrease in market share of other products like the Amazon Basics Mousepad, MROCO and SteelSeries. Note that the only change across the two sets of experiments is the change in the product description, hence this impact is causal. This example illustrates the potential of changing market shares by simply optimizing the product description to appear more attractive to an AI buying agent. This is very much akin to search engine optimization (SEO), which is the practice of optimizing keywords in website in order to have it rank higher in search results. We note that the gains in market share are not uniform across different AI buying agents. For the case of Claude Sonnet 4, we see that the change in market share of Aothia due to the product description change is around 5.3% and statistically significant while for the case of Gemini 2.5 Flash, the change in market share is only 2.0% (and not statistically significant), cf. Figures 12c and 12d. This demonstrates that there can be non-uniform impact of such interventions. In the next section, we provide the change in market shares across 37 different product categories.
