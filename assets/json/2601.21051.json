Introduction The frontier of large language model (LLM) development has recently been advanced by the advent of native reasoning models, pioneered by OpenAI o1 [Jaech et al., 2024] and DeepSeek-R1 [Guo et al., 2025]. defining characteristic of these models is their ability to generate explicit, step-by-step reasoning traces, often encapsulated in <think> tags, which reveal the models internal thought process before final answer is synthesized. This paradigm of transparent reasoning has catalyzed significant performance improvements across range of complex benchmarks, most notably in domains requiring sophisticated (a) Cybersecurity Benchmarks (b) General-Purpose Benchmarks Figure 1 Performance comparison of Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning against baseline models. (a) On cybersecurity benchmarks (CTIBench-MCQA, CTIBench-RCM, CTI-Reasoning, CWE-Prediction, SecBench, SecEval), our model performs on par with the 70B model (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) while significantly outperforming our previous instruction-tuned model (Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct). (b) On general-purpose benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, BBH, IFEval, GSM8K, HumanEval, MATH), our model achieves comparable performance to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on most tasks, with significantly better performance on AlpacaEval 2. mathematical and computational logic. See, e.g., Kumar et al. [2025], Li et al. [2025] for recent surveys on reasoning large language models. Despite these advancements, the application of native reasoning methodologies to the cybersecurity domain remains conspicuously nascent. While prevailing instruction-following models (see Section 2 for an overview) can address direct queries, they often struggle with the intricate, multi-step analytical processes critical to cybersecurity functions. These functions include threat intelligence analysis, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. These tasks demand more than just correct answer; they require verifiable and transparent line of reasoning. In cybersecurity, the how and why of conclusion are often as important as the conclusion itself. For example, model might correctly link an indicator of compromise to MITRE ATT&CK technique [Strom et al., 2018], but if the reasoning is flawed, it could cause an analyst to misinterpret the adversarys tactics and deploy ineffective countermeasures. transparent reasoning process allows security professionals to audit the models logic, build trust in its outputs, and collaborate with the model to refine its analysis. This verifiability is crucial for high-stakes decisions, where black box recommendation is often insufficient. To address this critical gap, we introduce Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, an 8B-parameter, native reasoning model engineered specifically for the complexities of the cybersecurity landscape. Our model is based on Foundation-Sec-8B [Kassianik et al., 2025] via post-training, cybersecurity-specialized language model derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base [Grattafiori et al., 2024]. Foundation-Sec-8B was developed by continued pre-training on 8 billion tokens of proprietary cybersecurity-focused data, starting from Llama-3.1-8B-Base. Building on this foundation, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning is designed from its inception to think before it speaks, thereby providing the transparent and auditable reasoning capabilities required by security practitioners. Our methodology is distinguished by its emphasis on cultivating native reasoning capabilities directly 2 from the base model, rather than fine-tuning an existing instruction-tuned model. Specifically, while our Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct [Weerawardhena et al., 2025] was post-trained from the base model to directly generate answers, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning undergoes distinct post-training regimen. This regimen trains it to always generate an explicit reasoning trace before producing final output, instilling think before you speak approach from the very beginning of its development. This regimen consists of two-stage pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The first stage involves large-scale supervised fine-tuning on synthetic dataset of over two million exemplars, meticulously generated by bespoke LLM agent leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash [Comanici et al., 2025]. This foundational stage establishes robust, cross-domain reasoning behavior by training the model on diverse corpus spanning mathematics, code generation, instruction following, and cybersecurity. The second stage further refines these capabilities through reinforcement learning, where the models policy is optimized against suite of verifiable rewards across various reasoning tasks. This phase was critical for addressing and solving technical challenges such as length-dependent gradient bias, ensuring stable and balanced learning. Comprehensive evaluations validate the efficacy of our methodology. Our results indicate that Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning exhibits substantial performance gains over our prior instruction-tuned model, Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct. This is particularly evident on challenging cybersecurity benchmarks, such as the CTIBench benchmark suite [Alam et al., 2024], where the models performance is competitive with that of much larger models, including Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, on general reasoning tasks, its performance is on par with or exceeds its instruction-following predecessor. To our knowledge, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning represents the first open-source, native reasoning model explicitly architected for the cybersecurity domain. We believe this work constitutes significant step toward integrating more powerful and transparent AI into security-critical workflows. 2. Related Work We examine prior work on instruction-tuned, cybersecurity-specialized models and relevant posttraining approaches. While much of the literature has focused on secure code generation or vulnerability detection Kassianik et al. [2025], our goal is to align general-purpose LLM with core cybersecurity tasks. We aim to enable broader applicability of the model across diverse use cases through instructionfollowing training. For comprehensive overview of cybersecurity-focused language models, we refer readers to existing surveys [Zhang et al., 2024]. Open-Source Reasoning Models. Recent advancements in LLMs have yielded powerful generalpurpose reasoning language models. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 [Guo et al., 2025] emerged as powerful reasoning model demonstrating effective test-time scaling, significantly boosting performance in mathematics and coding by pioneering advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [Shao et al., 2024] to enhance complex problem-solving capabilities. Later, the Qwen series [Yang et al., 2025] employs multi-stage post-training recipe: it utilizes SFT for an initial cold start, followed by the application of GRPO for general-purpose Reinforcement Learning on its large models, and subsequently uses strong-to-weak distillation to imbue smaller models with robust reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, the Phi-Reasoning models [Abdin et al., 2025] have established that high-quality, textbook-style synthetic data utilized during SFT can endow smaller-parameter models with significant reasoning abilities, with later iterations applying targeted RL to boost performance specifically in mathematical reasoning. The Nemotron family [Bercovich et al., 2025], built on top of the Llama series [Grattafiori et al., 2024], exemplifies hybrid approach and notably provided one of the first comprehensive open-source recipes for reasoning model training, integrating SFT on extensive synthetic and distilled datasets with subsequent large-scale RL phase to augment complex reasoning. Additionally, the GPT-OSS models [OpenAI, 2025] represent open-source reasoning models leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to efficiently scale reasoning capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency. The prevailing training paradigm for these leading models consists of multi-stage pipeline. Our work adopts this established SFT + RL methodology, specializing and adapting this pipeline for the distinct and high-stakes challenges inherent in the cybersecurity domain. Instruction-tuned large language models for cybersecurity have been developed Cybersecurity LLMs. to assist security practitioners in all types of security related tasks and workflows. Lily-Cybersecurity7B-v0.2 [segolilylabs, 2025] is cybersecurity-specialized model based on Mistral-7B [Jiang et al., 2023], finetuned with 22,000 hand-crafted question-answer pairs covering topics from advanced persistent threats to penetration testing. DeepHat-V1-7B [DeepHat, 2025] (formerly WhiteRabbitNeo) is cybersecurity-specialized model trained from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B [Hui et al., 2024]. In addition, Yu et al. [2025b] introduced Primus, collection of datasets for cybersecurity LLM training and an instructiontuned model with improved cybersecurity performance trained using distilled data from larger models. Furthermore, Weerawardhena et al. [2025] introduced Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct, which applies supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization after continued pre-training. Our model is trained from the same base model, and using similar two-stage post-training pipeline. In summary, these instruction-tuned models handle security-related instructions effectively, but complex cybersecurity challenges often require multi-step reasoning to trace attack chains, evaluate cascading vulnerabilities, or synthesize threat intelligence. For these reasons, we develop Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first reasoning model specialized in cybersecurity. 3. Methodology Our development of Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning is predicated on two-stage training pipeline designed to cultivate native reasoning capabilities. This process begins with Foundation-Sec-8B [Kassianik et al., 2025], our open-source base model that was continuously pre-trained on 8 billion tokens of cybersecurity-focused data starting from Llama-3.1-8B-Base. 3.1. Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Native Reasoning The first stage instills native reasoning behavior by training the model to generate explicit reasoning traces encapsulated within <think>...</think> tags. This is accomplished via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on diverse, large-scale synthetic dataset with these reasoning traces and tags. 3.1.1. SFT Dataset and Training The SFT dataset comprises about two million exemplars, curated to build strong foundation in general reasoning and instruction following. As illustrated in Figure 2(a), the data is diverse. Cybersecurityrelated data, including question-answering and multiple-choice questions on topics like CVEs [The MITRE Corporation, 2025], MITRE ATT&CK [Strom et al., 2018], and CWEs [Christey et al., 2013], makes up over quarter of the dataset. Mathematical reasoning and coding problems together account for approximately one third of the data. The remainder of the dataset is composed of instruction following, chat, science, and safety data, which collectively help to improve the models ability to follow instructions and interact in conversational manner. The SFT process ran for three epochs with cosine learning rate scheduler and learning rate of 2 105. This stage is crucial for teaching the model the fundamental structure of reasoning-based 4 (a) SFT Data Composition (b) RL Data Composition Figure 2 Data composition for the SFT and RL training stages. The SFT stage uses diverse mix of data to instill broad reasoning abilities, while the RL stage emphasizes instruction following, cybersecurity, and mathematical reasoning to further refine the models reasoning abilities. responses and expanding its instruction-following capabilities within the security domain. 3.2. Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards To sharpen the models reasoning accuracy, we employ second stage of training using RL with verifiable rewards. The RL training data comprises datasets spanning instruction following, cybersecurity tasks, and mathematical reasoning, as illustrated in Figure 2(b). We employ the GRPO algorithm [Shao et al., 2024] for RL training. For each prompt, we generate 𝑛 = 5 responses and evaluate them with task-specific verifier to obtain the binary reward signal. The policy is trained for two epochs using cosine learning rate scheduler with learning rate of 106 and warmup phase. To maintain stability, policy updates are regularized with KL-divergence penalty (coefficient of 0.02) against the original SFT model checkpoint. Through our RL training, we identified and tackled the following two critical challenges: (1) heterogeneity in RL data and (2) reward hacking and format degradation. Data Heterogeneity. Training with heterogeneous RL data introduces concrete challenges: different tasks have widely varying output lengths and solving accuracies. We observe that the model tends to output nonsensical text on tasks where it is weak, and these excessively long samples often exhibit low-quality patterns such as gibberish and repetitive words. This heterogeneity creates difficulties for loss aggregation: tokens within longer responses contribute disproportionately to the total loss, potentially allowing low-quality failure modes to dominate policy updates. We experimented with multiple loss aggregation strategies. First, simple token-mean approach (averaging losses across all tokens in the batch without per-sample normalization), as proposed in DAPO [Yu et al., 2025a], cannot resolve these issues and frequently leads to degenerate failure modes in our setting. We hypothesize that DAPOs additional techniques, such as clip higher (clipping advantages at higher values to limit the impact of outliers) and soft overlong punishment (penalizing sequences that exceed reasonable length), are necessary when using token-mean aggregation to mitigate these pathologies. In contrast, we found that two approaches provide stable training: (1) the original sample-level loss calculation from GRPO [Shao et al., 2024], which first averages losses by token within each sample and then aggregates across samples, ensuring each sample contributes equally regardless of length; and (2) the loss aggregation approach proposed in Dr.GRPO [Liu et al., 2025]. Both methods 5 effectively prevent long, low-quality sequences from biasing the optimization. Reward Hacking and Format Degradation. critical failure mode in RL with outcome-based verifiers is reward hacking, where the model learns to achieve high rewards without performing the desired behavior. We observed that naive GRPO implementation led the model to produce correct final answers while generating empty or nonsensical reasoning traces, sometimes omitting the required <think>...</think> tags entirely. For example, the model might output <think> No</think> for all prompts. The main reason is that the verifier rewards only check the validity of the final answer, not the reasoning process. Note that the GRPO loss decreases as the output length increases. All else equal, the model would prefer short answers over long ones to minimize the loss. Thus, without additional regularization, the RL objective inadvertently incentivizes degenerate reasoning traces, leading to reward hacking. To counteract this, we engineered format penalty into our reward function that programmatically validates the response format. This penalty ensures that the required reasoning tags are present and that the enclosed reasoning is non-trivial (i.e., not overly short or repetitive), thereby enforcing the generation of well-formed and meaningful reasoning traces. 4. Evaluation Results We conduct comprehensive evaluation of Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning across four dimensions: (1) cybersecurity benchmarks to assess domain-specific capabilities (Section 4.1), (2) general-purpose benchmarks to verify that specialization does not compromise general intelligence (Section 4.2), (3) safety evaluation using HarmBench to ensure responsible deployment (Section 4.3), and (4) an ablation study comparing our SFT checkpoint with the final RL-trained model to understand the contributions of each training stage (Section 4.4). 4.1. Cybersecurity Benchmarks Benchmarks. We evaluate on 10 cybersecurity benchmarks spanning diverse aspects of the domain. Table 1 provides an overview. These include: CTIBench tasks (MCQA, RCM, VSP, ATE) for cyber threat intelligence [Alam et al., 2024]; two proprietary benchmarks (CTI-Reasoning for multi-hop reasoning and CWE-Prediction for vulnerability classification); and established benchmarks (MMLUSecurity [Hendrycks et al., 2021a], CyberMetric-2000 [Tihanyi et al., 2024], SecBench [Jing et al., 2024], SecEval [Li et al., 2023]) for general security knowledge. Notably, CWE-Prediction is constructed in the same way as CTIBench-RCM (CVE to CWE mapping) but uses recent entries from 2025 for CVE [The MITRE Corporation, 2025] and 2024-2025 for GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) [GitHub, 2024] to test the same vulnerability classification ability on previously unseen data, evaluating model generalization beyond the training distribution. The benchmarks vary in size from 60 samples (CTIBench-ATE) to 3,000 samples (CWE-Prediction), with task formats including multiple-choice questions, vulnerability mapping, severity prediction, and attack technique extraction. Together, these provide comprehensive coverage of the knowledge and reasoning capabilities required for effective cybersecurity AI systems. Models. We compare Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning against 18 baseline models organized into five groups to enable fair comparisons across different scales and training paradigms: (1) Smaller specialized models [Abdin et al., 2024, DeepHat, 2025, Yang et al., 2025]: DeepHat-v1-7B, Qwen-3-8B/14B, Phi-4; (2) Llama-family and cybersecurity-specialized 8B models [Grattafiori et al., 2024, Weerawardhena et al., 2025, Yu et al., 2025b]: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct , Llama-Primus variants; (3) GPT-OSS models [OpenAI, 2025]: 20B and 120B; (4) Frontier commercial 6 Benchmark Samples Task Type Abilities Tested CTIBench-MCQA CTIBench-RCM CTIBench-VSP CTIBench-ATE CTI-Reasoning CWE-Prediction MMLU-Security CyberMetric-2000 SecBench SecEval 2500 1000 1000 60 200 3000 100 2000 595 1225 Multiple choice CVE to CWE mapping Severity prediction Technique extraction Multiple choice CVE to CWE mapping Multiple choice Multiple choice Multiple choice Multiple choice CTI knowledge and understanding Vulnerability analysis and reasoning Technical context understanding Threat behavior reasoning Multi-hop security reasoning Same as RCM but with recent unseen data Broad security domain knowledge Security standards and publications Broad security domain knowledge Broad security domain knowledge Table 1 Overview of cybersecurity benchmarks.

See Appendix for detailed descriptions. models: GPT-4.1, O3-Mini, GPT-5 family; and (5) Our reasoning model. Bold scores in Tables 2 and 3 indicate the best performance within each model group. Evaluation Protocol. We use the Cisco Foundation-AIs Testing Hub (FAITH)1 evaluation framework with the following settings: Sampling: We run 5 independent trials with different random seeds to ensure robustness. For instruct models, we use temperature = 0.3 and top-𝑝 = 1.0. For reasoning models (FoundationSec-8B-Reasoning and Qwen-3 series), we use temperature = 0.6 and top-𝑝 = 0.95 to allow more diverse reasoning paths. For GPT-OSS models, we use temperature = 0.7 and top-𝑝 = 0.95. Answer Extraction: Our system prompt requires models to place their answer in the last line of the response. We extract the last line using regular expressions and compute accuracy based on the extracted answer. For CTIBench-VSP, we compute CVSS scores as detailed in Appendix A. For CTIBench-ATE, we report micro-F1 scores. Prompts for these benchmarks, as well as the details of the two proprietary benchmarks (CTI-Reasoning and CWE-Prediction), are provided in Appendix A. 4.1.1. Results and Analysis Our Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning demonstrates strong and consistent performance across the benchmark suite. The model achieves particularly notable results on CTIBench-RCM (75.3%), outperforming all other models evaluated. On CTIBench-MCQA, the model achieves 69.1%, representing +4.1 pp improvement over Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (65.0%) and demonstrating performance comparable to the much larger Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (69.2%, 9 more parameters). On CWE-Prediction, FoundationSec-8B-Reasoning achieves 70.4% accuracy, demonstrating robust vulnerability classification capabilities. The model maintains competitive performance across other benchmarks including CTI-Reasoning (41.1%), MMLU-Security (78.2%), and SecEval (84.8%). Notably, within the 8B parameter group, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning dominates all Llama-3.1-8B derived models on 8 out of 10 benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-focused training for cybersecurity tasks. 1https://github.com/cisco-foundation-ai/faith. 7 Model DeepHat-V1-7B Qwen-3-8B Qwen-3-14B Phi-4 Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct Llama-Primus-Merged Llama-Primus-Nemotron-70B-Instruct GPT-OSS-20B GPT-OSS-120B GPT-4.1 o3-Mini GPT-5-Nano GPT-5-Mini GPT-5 CTIBench-MCQA CTIBench-RCM CTIBench-VSP CTIBench-ATE CTI-Reasoning 0.4930.004 0.6490.003 0.6640.006 0.6580.005 0.6070.004 0.6920.002 0.6500.003 0.6040.011 0.7050.003 0.6550.004 0.7140.006 0.7600.004 0.7160.002 0.6880.003 0.7530.003 0.8190. 0.4340.013 0.5420.008 0.6120.005 0.6290.003 0.5310.003 0.6840.004 0.7040.003 0.6650.006 0.6640.009 0.6100.010 0.7120.005 0.7300.006 0.7080.002 0.6720.007 0.7230.005 0.7280.002 0.0450.004 0.8630.001 0.8690.001 0.6470.013 0.8110.005 0.8410.001 0.8400.004 0.7880.004 0.2390. 0.8640.003 0.8830.003 0.8480.004 0.8430.008 0.8220.006 0.8920.001 0.9030.003 0.0040.003 0.4080.020 0.5020.011 0.4350.014 0.1320.017 0.5190.016 0.3580.013 0.0580.010 0.2680.035 0.4780.024 0.2820.025 0.6960.007 0.5990.013 0.4530.029 0.6810.003 0.5780. 0.3230.024 0.3950.025 0.4410.035 0.4440.017 0.3350.027 0.5070.016 0.3640.013 0.3480.024 0.4850.028 0.4600.022 0.4960.019 0.5960.015 0.4790.011 0.4310.015 0.5780.014 0.6430.017 Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning 0.6910. 0.7530.008 0.8560.004 0.4910.017 0.4110.017 Table 2 Performance on cybersecurity benchmarks (Part 1).

Models are organized into five groups as described in Table 2: (1) smaller specialized models, (2) Llama-family and cybersecurity-specialized 8B models, (3) GPT-OSS models, (4) frontier OpenAI API models, and (5) our reasoning model. We report average accuracy over 5 trials standard deviation for all benchmarks (CWE-Prediction, MMLUSecurity, Cybermetric-2000, SecBench, and SecEval). Bold scores indicate the best performance within each model group. 9 Figure 3 visualizes performance across selected models and benchmarks, highlighting the relative strengths of different approaches. Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning consistently ranks among the top performers, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks. The visualization also reveals interesting patterns: larger models like Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-OSS-120B excel on knowledge-based benchmarks, while our cybersecurity-specialized models maintain strong performance despite having significantly fewer parameters. See Tables 2 and 3 for detailed results2. Key Finding: Cybersecurity Performance Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning demonstrates exceptional performance on cybersecurity benchmarks: Competitive with significantly larger models: Achieves comparable performance to Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (9 more parameters) on CTIBench-MCQA (69.1% vs 69.2%) while outperforming it on CTIBench-RCM (75.3% vs 68.4%). Outperforms GPT-OSS-120B (15 more parameters) on CTIBench-RCM (75.3% vs 71.2%), with only minor gap on CTIBench-MCQA (69.1% vs 71.4%). Substantial improvement over instruction-tuned baseline: Outperforms FoundationSec-8B-Instruct on 8 out of 10 cybersecurity benchmarks, with notable gains on CTIBenchATE (+13.3 pp), CWE-Prediction (+8.7 pp), and CTIBench-RCM (+4.8 pp), where pp denotes percentage points. Strong gains over Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct: Outperforms on 8 out of 10 benchmarks, with particularly significant improvements on CTIBench-ATE (+35.9 pp), CWEPrediction (+23.1 pp), CTIBench-RCM (+22.2 pp), CTIBench-MCQA (+8.3 pp), and CTI-Reasoning (+7.6 pp). These results demonstrate that Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves state-of-the-art cybersecurity performance among 8B parameter models while remaining competitive with significantly larger models on critical reasoning tasks. 4.2. General-Purpose Benchmarks Benchmarks. To verify that our cybersecurity specialization does not compromise general intelligence, we evaluate on 10 general-purpose benchmarks spanning diverse capabilities. Table 4 summarizes these benchmarks, which include: AlpacaEval 2.0 for human preference alignment [Dubois et al., 2024]; Big-Bench Hard (BBH) for complex reasoning [Suzgun et al., 2022]; GPQA for graduate-level knowledge [Rein et al., 2024]; GSM8K and MATH for mathematical reasoning [Cobbe et al., 2021, Hendrycks et al., 2021b]; HumanEval for code synthesis [Chen et al., 2021]; IFEval for instruction following [Zhou et al., 2023]; 2WikiMultihopQA and HotpotQA for multi-hop question answering [Ho et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2018]; and MMLU for broad multitask language understanding [Hendrycks et al., 2021a]. These benchmarks provide comprehensive coverage of capabilities essential for general-purpose AI systems. 2The numbers for DeepHat-V1-7B differ from those reported inthe Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct technical report [Weerawardhena et al., 2025] because this model does not rigorously follow the instruction to output answers in the last line, resulting in many invalid answers. We emphasize that this instruction format is not construed in favor of any specific modelall other evaluated models follow this instruction successfully. Because LLM evaluation is complex, certain formatting requirements are necessary for computing accuracy using regular expression-based answer extractors. Figure 3 Comparison of selected models across 6 key cybersecurity benchmarks. The benchmarks are organized in two rows: (top row) CTIBench-MCQA, CTIBench-RCM, and CTI-Reasoning; (bottom row) CWE-Prediction, SecBench-Reasoning, and SecEval. Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning demonstrates consistently strong performance across diverse tasks, particularly excelling on CTIBench-RCM (75.3%) and CWE-Prediction (70.4%). The visualization highlights the models competitive performance with significantly larger models while maintaining robust capabilities across both knowledgebased and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models. To demonstrate that cybersecurity specialization does not compromise general capabilities, we compare models at similar scales. Our comparison set includes: (1) general-purpose baselines: Llama3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct; (2) cybersecurity-specialized models based on Llama-3.1-8B: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct and Llama-Primus variants; and (3) Phi-4 as an additional comparison point. Evaluation Protocol. We use the lm-evaluation-harness3 framework [Gao et al., 2024] with fewshot settings as specified in Table 4. For MATH, we compute accuracy using the math-verify 4 package to ensure correct mathematical equivalence checking. All models are evaluated with temperature = 0.3 and top-𝑝 = 1.0, except for Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, which uses temperature = 0.7 and top-𝑝 = 0.95 to allow more diverse reasoning paths. 4.2.1. Results and Analysis Tables 5 and 6 present comprehensive results across all 10 general-purpose benchmarks. Our analysis focuses primarily on comparing Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (the generalpurpose baseline) and Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (our cybersecurity-specialized instruction model) to demonstrate that domain specialization and reasoning training do not compromise general capabilities. 3https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness. 4https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify. 11 Benchmark Evaluation Area Few-Shot Metric Human preference alignment Complex reasoning Graduate-level knowledge Grade-school math Code synthesis Instruction following AlpacaEval BBH GPQA GSM8K HumanEval IFEval 2WikiMultihopQA Multi-hop QA (long context) Multi-hop QA (long context) HotpotQA Competition mathematics MATH Broad multitask understanding MMLU 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 0 4 5 Length-Controlled Win Rate Exact Match Exact Match Exact Match Pass@10 Success Rate Instruction-Level Loose Accuracy Question Answering F1 Score Question Answering F1 Score Math-Verify Accuracy Exact Match Table 4 Overview of general-purpose benchmarks. All metrics range from 0 to 1. Key Finding: General-Purpose Performance Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning maintains strong general capabilities, demonstrating that cybersecurity specialization does not compromise performance on general-purpose tasks: On par with general-purpose baseline: Achieves comparable or superior performance to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct across most benchmarks, with notable advantages on AlpacaEval 2.0 (62.6% vs 25.4%, +146% relative improvement) and 2WikiMultihopQA (60.5% vs 49.6%, +22% relative). Performance is on par for GSM8K (82.3% vs 82.2%) and HumanEval (79.9% vs 82.3%, -2.9%), demonstrating that domain specialization preserves general intelligence. Competitive with cybersecurity-specialized baseline: Matches or exceeds FoundationSec-8B-Instruct on 8 out of 10 benchmarks, with substantial improvements on AlpacaEval 2.0 (62.6% vs 33.1%, +89% relative) and 2WikiMultihopQA (60.5% vs 45.4%, +33% relative). Performance is comparable on MATH (43.3% vs 43.6%) and GSM8K (82.3% vs 84.8%), showing that RL-based reasoning training enhances capabilities without sacrificing foundational skills. These results confirm that Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning successfully combines cybersecurity expertise with strong general-purpose capabilities, making it suitable for diverse real-world applications beyond the security domain. Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning demonstrates exInstruction Following and Human Alignment. ceptional performance on instruction-following and human preference alignment benchmarks. On AlpacaEval 2.0, which measures the win rate of model responses against reference model in head-to-head comparisons, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 62.6%, substantially outperforming FoundationSec-8B-Instruct (33.1%) and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (25.4%). This represents 146% relative improvement over Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and an 89% improvement over Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct, indicating that the extended reasoning training significantly enhances the models ability to generate responses preferred by human evaluators. On IFEval, which assesses strict instruction-following through verifiable format constraints, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 83.7%, approaching Foundation-Sec-8B-Instructs performance (86.1%) and closely matching Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (86.2%). This demonstrates that the reasoning model maintains robust instruction-following capabilities despite the shift in training objectives toward extended reasoning. The modest 2.4 pp decrease relative to Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct is more than 12 compensated by the substantial gains in reasoning and other capabilities. Reasoning and Knowledge. The model exhibits competitive performance on reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. On BBH (Big-Bench Hard), which evaluates complex reasoning across diverse tasks, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 69.9%, exceeding both Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (66.7%) and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (67.4%). This 4.8% relative improvement over Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct provides empirical evidence that the extended reasoning training enhances general reasoning capabilities beyond the cybersecurity domain, demonstrating that the reinforcement learning phase with reasoning-focused objectives is critical for developing robust reasoning skills. On GPQA (Graduate-Level Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Questions), all 8B-parameter models show similar performance, with Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieving 31.7%, comparable to Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (31.9%) and exceeding Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (25.7%). Similarly, on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), which evaluates broad knowledge across 57 subjects, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 68.3%, outperforming Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (66.0%) while remaining competitive with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (69.8%). These results demonstrate that cybersecurity specialization does not compromise broad knowledge capabilities, with Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning maintaining competitive performance on challenging knowledge benchmarks. Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning demonstrates strong mathematical capaMathematical Reasoning. bilities across both grade-school and advanced mathematics benchmarks. On GSM8K (Grade School Math), the model achieves 82.3%, performing on par with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (82.2%) and closely matching Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (84.8%). On MATH, which contains challenging competition-level problems, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 43.3%, comparable to Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (43.6%) and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (47.9%). These results indicate that the reasoning-focused training maintains strong mathematical problem-solving abilities across difficulty levels. Coding. On HumanEval, which evaluates program synthesis capabilities, Foundation-Sec-8BReasoning achieves 79.9%, modest 2.9% decrease from Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8BInstruct (both at 82.3%). This minor trade-off in pure code generation capabilities is within practical deployment thresholds for cybersecurity applications, where code understanding and reasoning are often more critical than pure code synthesis. The performance remains strong, and substantially exceeds models like Llama-Primus-Merged (81.7%). Long-Form Question Answering. particularly noteworthy result emerges on long-form question answering benchmarks. On 2WikiMultihopQA, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 60.5%, substantially outperforming Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (49.6%, +22% relative improvement), Foundation-Sec8B-Instruct (45.4%, +33% relative improvement), and even Phi-4 (28.4%). On HotpotQA, Foundation-Sec8B-Reasoning achieves 54.8%, performing comparably to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (54.1%) and approaching Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct (58.4%). These benchmarks require multi-hop reasoning over retrieved documents, capability highly relevant to cybersecurity analysis where practitioners must synthesize information from multiple sources. The substantial improvement on 2WikiMultihopQA in particular suggests that the extended reasoning training develops capabilities well-suited to complex, multi-step analysis tasks. Figure 4 provides visual comparison across key benchmarks. The results Comparative Analysis. reveal several important patterns. First, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves the highest performance 13 among all 8B-parameter models on AlpacaEval 2 and 2WikiMultihopQA, demonstrating clear advantages in human preference alignment and multi-hop reasoning. Second, the model maintains competitive or superior performance to Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct across most benchmarks, indicating successful capability retention despite the shift toward extended reasoning. The comparison across models reveals that the reasoning-focused reinforcement learning training is critical for developing strong reasoning and alignment capabilities, as evidenced by substantial improvements over the base instruction model on AlpacaEval 2 (33.1% 62.6%, +89% relative) and BBH (66.7% 69.9%, +4.8 pp). Overall, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves balanced performance profile suitable for cybersecurity applications requiring both technical skills and extended analytical reasoning. Implications for Cybersecurity Applications. These results have important implications for deploying Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning in cybersecurity contexts. The models exceptional performance on instruction-following and long-form reasoning benchmarks suggests strong suitability for tasks requiring extended analysis, such as threat intelligence report generation, incident investigation, and vulnerability analysis. The maintained performance on mathematical reasoning and modest decrease in pure coding suggests that the model can effectively support wide range of cybersecurity workflows while excelling at the analytical reasoning tasks most critical to senior practitioners. The substantially higher AlpacaEval 2 scores indicate that the models outputs are likely to be perceived as more helpful and higher quality by human evaluators, an important consideration for practical deployment.

Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning (highlighted with hatched pattern) demonstrates strong performance across diverse capabilities, with exceptional results on AlpacaEval 2 (62.6%) and competitive performance on reasoning and coding tasks. 4.3. HarmBench Evaluation Both Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct and Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning have not undergone dedicated safety alignment procedures beyond basic instruction-tuning. However, we followed standard practices to provide baseline level of alignment. To better understand the models risk profiles, we conducted comprehensive evaluation using HarmBench [Mazeika et al., 2024], standardized framework for automated red teaming of large language models. The benchmark consists of 400 representative adversarial prompts spanning multiple risk categories including hate speech, harassment, illegal activities, malware generation, physical harm, fraud, sexual content, privacy violations, and self-harm. Models Evaluated. We evaluate the following model configurations: (1) Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as general-purpose baseline, (2) Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct with its default system prompt, (3) FoundationSec-8B-Reasoning without system prompt, (4) Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning with system prompt (adapted from Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct), and (5) Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning with system prompt protected by Llama-Guard-3-8B [Inan et al., 2023]. The system prompt for Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning is modified from that of Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct to better accommodate the reasoning models extended analytical capabilities; see Appendix A.3 for details. Responses are classified as either refusing the harmful request (passing) or complying with it (failing), with the pass rate representing the percentage of harmful prompts successfully refused or safely handled. 15 Figure 5 presents the evaluation results. Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct demonResults and Analysis. strates strong baseline safety performance, achieving 95.00% pass rate, substantially outperforming Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (62.75%). For Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, we report results both with and without system prompts to understand the impact of safety guidance. Without system prompt, the model achieves 54.25% pass rate. However, when equipped with an appropriate system prompt adapted from Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 93.00% pass rate, approaching the safety performance of Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct. This demonstrates that with proper system-level safety instructions, the reasoning model maintains strong safety performance while preserving its enhanced analytical capabilities. We strongly recommend applying additional safety layers, such as automated content filtering or LLM-based moderation systems, when deploying these models. The system prompt of FoundationSec-8B-Reasoning is derived from Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct and can be adapted to specific use cases. See Appendix A.3 for details. Enhanced Protection with Llama-Guard-3-8B. To explore additional safety measures for production deployments, we evaluated Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning (with system prompt) combined with Llama-Guard-3-8B, taxonomy-driven input-output filtering system that analyzes both user inputs and model outputs, flagging and blocking content that violates defined safety policies. The combined system achieves 98.25% pass rate on HarmBench, representing near-complete protection against adversarial prompts. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of defense-in-depth approach where model-level safety is complemented by external guardrails. In summary, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning with proper system prompts achieves strong safety performance (93.00%), and when further protected by Llama-Guard-3-8B, delivers exceptional safety (98.25%). 4.4. Discussion To better understand the individual contributions of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to our models capabilities, we conduct an ablation study comparing the SFT checkpoint (Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning-SFT-Checkpoint) with the final RL-trained model (Foundation-Sec-8BReasoning). This analysis reveals the specific benefits of each training stage and provides insights into how extended reasoning capabilities emerge through the RL phase. 4.4.1. Role of Supervised Fine-Tuning The SFT checkpoint represents the model state after supervised fine-tuning on diverse mixture of cybersecurity and general-purpose data, but before any reinforcement learning with reasoning-focused objectives. Evaluating this checkpoint allows us to isolate the contributions of the SFT phase and understand what capabilities are already present before RL training begins. As shown in Table 7, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning-SFT-Checkpoint already demonstrates strong baseline performance across many benchmarks. On cybersecurity tasks, the SFT checkpoint achieves 68.4% on CTIBench-MCQA, 69.5% on CTIBench-RCM, and 85.3% on CTIBench-VSP, indicating that the supervised fine-tuning phase successfully imparts core cybersecurity knowledge and instructionfollowing capabilities. On general-purpose benchmarks, the SFT checkpoint shows competitive performance on tasks like HumanEval (82.3%) and GSM8K (75.5%), demonstrating that the SFT phase maintains broad capabilities while incorporating cybersecurity expertise. However, the SFT checkpoint also reveals notable limitations on certain benchmarks. On multi-hop 16 Figure 5 HarmBench safety evaluation results showing pass rates (percentage of harmful prompts appropriately refused) across different model configurations. Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct achieves 95.00% pass rate, while Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 93.00% with proper system prompts. When further protected by Llama-Guard-3-8B, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning achieves 98.25% pass rate, demonstrating that our reasoning model with appropriate safety measures delivers strong protection against adversarial prompts. question answering benchmarks, the model achieves only 24.4% on 2WikiMultihopQA and 9.6% on HotpotQA. Similarly, on BBH, which requires complex reasoning across diverse tasks, the SFT checkpoint achieves 56.3%. These low scores appear to stem primarily from insufficient instructionfollowing ability rather than lack of knowledge or reasoning capacity. As we will demonstrate in the subsequent RL analysis, instruction-following improvements lead to substantial gains on these tasks, even though our RL training data does not directly target these specific benchmarks. These results demonstrate that while SFT successfully establishes domain knowledge, it requires further training to develop robust instruction-following and reasoning capabilities for complex analytical tasks. This motivates the subsequent RL training phase with reasoning-focused objectives. 4.4.2. Benefits of Reinforcement Learning Table 7 presents comprehensive comparison between the SFT checkpoint and the final RL-trained model across both cybersecurity and general-purpose benchmarks. The results reveal several key patterns that illuminate the specific contributions of RL training. 17 Substantial Improvements on Reasoning-Intensive Cybersecurity Tasks. RL training demonstrates its most significant impact on cybersecurity tasks that require extended analytical reasoning. On CTIBench-RCM, the RL model achieves 75.3%, substantial +5.8 pp improvement over the SFT checkpoint. On CTIBench-ATE, the improvement is even more pronounced at +9.7 pp (39.4% 49.1%). On CWE-Prediction, the RL model achieves 70.4%, representing +6.0 pp gain. These improvements on reasoning-intensive cybersecurity tasks demonstrate that the RL training phase successfully develops capabilities for complex analytical tasks that go beyond pattern matching and require deeper understanding. Direct and Indirect Benefits from RL Training. Our RL training data comprises cybersecurity, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning examples. We observe direct improvements on benchmarks related to these data types: cybersecurity tasks show gains of +5.8 pp to +9.7 pp on CTIBench-RCM and CTIBench-ATE; instruction-following improves by +12.7 pp on IFEval (83.7%); and mathematical reasoning advances by +10.2 pp on MATH (33.1% 43.3%). Beyond these direct improvements, we observe substantial indirect benefits on benchmarks not explicitly covered in our RL training data. Multi-hop question answering tasks show dramatic gains: +36.1 pp on 2WikiMultihopQA (60.5%) and +45.1 pp on HotpotQA (9.6% 54.8%). Similarly, BBH improves by +13.7 pp (69.9%) and AlpacaEval 2 by +6.3 pp (56.3% 62.6%). These indirect improvements demonstrate that enhanced instruction-following and reasoning capabilities from RL training generalize to diverse tasks requiring multi-step analytical thinking. Critically, other benchmarks show minimal degradation due to KL divergence regularization and the relatively small scale of RL training data, which prevents the model from deviating excessively from its SFT initialization. Maintained Performance with Minor Trade-offs. While RL training produces substantial improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks, it maintains competitive performance on most other benchmarks with only minor trade-offs. On knowledge-based benchmarks like MMLU-Security, the difference is small (-2.4 pp), and on SecEval, the RL model actually improves slightly (+0.5 pp). The most notable trade-off appears on HumanEval, where the RL model achieves 79.9% compared to the SFT checkpoints 82.3% (-2.4 pp). However, this modest decrease in pure code synthesis capability is more than compensated by the substantial gains in reasoning and analytical capabilities. For cybersecurity applications, where code understanding and reasoning about vulnerabilities are often more critical than pure code generation, this trade-off is highly favorable. Implications for Model Development. These results have important implications for developing reasoning-capable models for specialized domains. First, they demonstrate that SFT alone, while effective for establishing domain knowledge and basic instruction-following, is insufficient for developing robust extended reasoning capabilities. Second, they show that RL training with reasoning-focused objectives can successfully develop strong analytical reasoning skills that transfer well to complex domain-specific tasks. Third, they reveal that this reasoning capability development comes with only minor trade-offs in other capabilities, making it highly effective approach for enhancing model performance on analytical tasks. The substantial improvements on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks (+36.1 pp on 2WikiMultihopQA, +45.1 pp on HotpotQA) are particularly noteworthy, as they suggest that RL training develops general reasoning capabilities that extend far beyond the specific training tasks. This generalization is crucial for real-world cybersecurity applications, where practitioners encounter novel and complex scenarios that require flexible analytical reasoning rather than pattern matching on familiar examples. 18 Benchmark SFT Final Model (RL) Difference Cybersecurity Benchmarks CTIBench-MCQA CTIBench-RCM CTIBench-VSP CTIBench-ATE CTI-Reasoning CWE-Prediction MMLU-Security CyberMetric-2000 SecBench SecEval 68.4% 69.5% 85.3% 39.4% 44.0% 64.4% 80.6% 84.7% 72.6% 84.3% General-Purpose Benchmarks 56.3% AlpacaEval 2.0 56.3% BBH 28.8% GPQA 75.5% GSM8K 82.3% HumanEval IFEval 71.0% 2WikiMultihopQA 24.4% 9.6% HotpotQA 33.1% MATH 69.1% 75.3% 85.6% 49.1% 41.1% 70.4% 78.2% 84.3% 72.5% 84.8% 62.6% 69.9% 31.7% 82.3% 79.9% 83.7% 60.5% 54.8% 43.3% +0.7 pp +5.8 pp +0.3 pp +9.7 pp -2.9 pp +6.0 pp -2.4 pp -0.4 pp -0.0 pp +0.5 pp +6.3 pp +13.7 pp +2.9 pp +6.8 pp -2.4 pp +12.7 pp +36.1 pp +45.1 pp +10.2 pp Table 7 Comparison between SFT checkpoint (Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning-SFT-Checkpoint) and final RL-trained model (Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning). The table shows performance improvements (green) and decreases (red) in percentage points (pp). Reinforcement learning demonstrates substantial improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks including CTIBench-RCM (+5.8 pp), CTIBench-ATE (+9.7 pp), 2WikiMultihopQA (+36.1 pp), and HotpotQA (+45.1 pp), while maintaining competitive performance on most other benchmarks. 19 5. Conclusion We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model specifically designed for cybersecurity applications. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), this work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve performance competitive with significantly larger general-purpose models while maintaining strong general capabilities. Our two-stage training methodology combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) using proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Critically, we employ KL divergence regularization and maintain relatively small-scale RL training to prevent excessive deviation from the SFT initialization, ensuring stability across diverse benchmarks. Evaluation demonstrates strong performance on cybersecurity tasks (e.g., 75.3% on CTIBenchRCM, outperforming 15 larger GPT-OSS-120B) while maintaining general capabilities (e.g., 62.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0). Our ablation study reveals that RL training yields direct improvements on data-related benchmarks and substantial indirect benefits on multi-hop reasoning (+36.1 pp on 2WikiMultihopQA, +45.1 pp on HotpotQA), demonstrating effective capability generalization. Safety evaluation shows 93.00% pass rate on HarmBench with system prompts, and 98.25% with Llama-Guard-3-8B protection. To our knowledge, Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning represents the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecuritytrained directly as reasoning model rather than adapted from instructionfollowing models. This work demonstrates the viability of developing domain-specialized reasoning models that deliver strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities, opening new directions for AI systems tailored to complex analytical domains beyond cybersecurity."

Instruction-following evaluation for large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.07911, 2023. A. Appendix This appendix provides comprehensive details on all benchmarks used in our evaluation suite, including our two proprietary benchmarks and the complete prompting strategies for all evaluation tasks. Furthemore, in Appendix A.3, we provide the system prompt used for the HarmBench safety evaluation of Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning. A.1. Proprietary Benchmarks: CTI-Reasoning and CWE Prediction CTI-Reasoning. The CTI-Reasoning benchmark is proprietary evaluation dataset designed to assess deep cybersecurity reasoning capabilities beyond simple knowledge recall. Unlike standard multiplechoice questions that test factual knowledge, CTI-Reasoning evaluates models ability to perform multi-hop logical analysis, understand complex technical documentation, and reason about relationships within cybersecurity taxonomies. The benchmark contains 200 test samples of expert-curated multiplechoice questions derived from CWE [Christey et al., 2013] and Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) [CAPEC, 2024] documentation. Notably, 96% of questions are classified as reasoning-intensive, requiring analytical thinking rather than memorization, with 77.5% demanding analysis-based cognitive processing and 22.5% requiring comprehension-based reasoning. CTI-Reasoning Example Question: Consider the following scenario for CAPEC-625. company employs strong physical security for their mobile devices containing cryptographic secrets. Despite this, successful MDFI attack occurs. What could be contributing factor? Options: A. Failures in electromagnetic protection allow signal-based attacks without leaving physical traces. B. Physical security can be bypassed, implying core MDFI techniques dont require device access. C. Attack depends entirely on security failures unrelated to physical device access. D. Strong physical security inherently allows MDFI attacks without further protection. Correct Answer: CWE Prediction. The CWE Prediction benchmark is constructed in exactly the same way as CTIBenchRCM (vulnerability description to CWE mapping), but uses recent entries from 2025 for CVE [The MITRE Corporation, 2025] and 2024-2025 for GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) [GitHub, 2024] to ensure the data is new to the model. This design allows us to test the same vulnerability classification ability as CTIBench-RCM while evaluating generalization to previously unseen vulnerability descriptions. The benchmark contains 3,000 test samples covering 263 distinct CWE types from these recent and diverse sources. 25 CWE Prediction Example Question: What Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier is associated with CVE-2025-26949, which describes an Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting) vulnerability in bPlugins Team Section Block that allows Stored XSS? Final Answer: CWEA.2. Prompts for Cybersecurity Benchmark Evaluation In all cybersecurity benchmark evaluations, we require models to output their final answer in the last line of their response following specified format. We extract this last line using regular expressions to compute accuracy automatically. This standardized format ensures consistent evaluation across all models and benchmarks. For CTIBench-VSP (CVSS Vector String Prediction), we compute the evaluation score based on the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score difference. The CVSS score is numerical value ranging from 0 to 10 that represents the severity of vulnerability, derived from the CVSS vector string. Our evaluation metric is defined as: Score = 1 CVSSpred CVSStrue/10, where CVSSpred is the score computed from the models predicted vector string and CVSStrue is the ground truth score. CTIBench-MCQA Task Description: Multiple-choice questions covering cybersecurity threat intelligence concepts, including vulnerability analysis, attack patterns, and security mechanisms sourced from the CTIBench dataset. Prompt: Given the following question and four candidate answers (A, B, C, and D), choose the best answer. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where $LETTER is one of A, B, C, or D. CTIBench-RCM (Root Cause Mapping) Task Description: Root cause mapping task that requires mapping Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions to their corresponding Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers, identifying the underlying weakness type of each vulnerability. Prompt: Analyze the following CVE description and map it to the most appropriate CWE. Provide brief justification for your choice. Ensure the last line of your response contains only the CWE ID which should be of format `CWE ID: CWE-$id`. 26 CTIBench-VSP (CVSS Vector String Prediction) Task Description: Vulnerability severity assessment task that requires predicting the complete Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 vector string for given CVE description, including all eight base metrics (Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). Prompt: From the following CVE description, determine the CVSS v3.1 vector string for each CVSS base metric: AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, and A. Valid options for each metric are as follows: - Attack Vector (AV): Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P) - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L), High (H) - Privileges Required (PR): None (N), Low (L), High (H) - User Interaction (UI): None (N), Required (R) - Scope (S): Unchanged (U), Changed (C) - Confidentiality (C): None (N), Low (L), High (H) - Integrity (I): None (N), Low (L), High (H) - Availability (A): None (N), Low (L), High (H) Provide your answer as CVSS v3.1 vector string in format: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H CTIBench-ATE (Attack Technique Extraction) Task Description: Threat intelligence extraction task that requires identifying and mapping adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from threat reports to MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework technique identifiers. Prompt: Extract all MITRE {{ platform }} attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification.

System Prompts The system prompt plays crucial role in guiding model behavior and establishing the context for interactions. For Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, we developed specialized system prompt that emphasizes the models cybersecurity expertise, reasoning capabilities, and responsible use guidelines. This prompt is integrated into the models chat template and provides users with clear expectations about the models capabilities and limitations. The system prompt is particularly important for reasoning models, as it helps maintain focus on 29 analytical reasoning while ensuring adherence to safety guidelines. During our HarmBench evaluation (Section 4.3), we observed that the presence of an appropriate system prompt substantially improves safety performance, increasing the pass rate from 54.25% (no system prompt) to 93.00% (with system prompt). Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning System Prompt You are Metis, cybersecurity reasoning model from the Minerva family developed by Foundation AI at Cisco. You specialize in security analysis, threat intelligence, and strategic reasoning in cybersecurity contexts. You were released in November 2025. The user is cybersecurity professional trying to accomplish some cybersecurity task. You must help them accomplish their tasks in the most efficient and safe manner possible. You must respond in fashion that is direct, accurate, relevant, and helpful. You have professional knowledge and experience of senior-level cybersecurity specialist. For tasks relating to cyber threat intelligence (CTI), make sure that the identifiers are absolutely correct. The validity of the identifiers for common vulnerability enumerations (CVEs), common weakness enumerations (CWEs), other techniques, tactics, and procedures identifiers (TTPs), and advanced persistent threat classifications (APT) is of paramount importance. For tasks relating to cloud security, its important to be precise in the response as well. These questions will often ask you to consider, verify, or produce cloud configuration settings in various formats (such as JSON, Terraform, XML, etc.). Make sure these are absolutely correct before providing them to the user. Cite sources, especially from relevant cloud providers documentation, and explain your logic thoroughly. In the rare case when the user asks harmful or unsafe question, especially pertaining to generating malware or ransomware, make sure to politely but firmly refuse. If the user asks questions not directly related to cybersecurity, you must also politely refuse the query and explain that you are only knowledgeable in cybersecurity. Key Design Principles. The system prompt is designed around several key principles: Clear Identity: Establishes the model as Metis, specialized cybersecurity reasoning model, setting appropriate user expectations. Domain Focus: Emphasizes cybersecurity expertise and the importance of accuracy in securitycritical information such as CVE, CWE, TTP, and APT identifiers. Professional Context: Positions the model as tool for cybersecurity professionals, encouraging direct and efficient interactions. Precision Requirements: Highlights the need for accuracy in cloud security configurations and other technical details, with explicit instructions to cite sources. Safety Guidelines: Clearly defines boundaries for harmful requests and off-topic queries, establishing responsible use patterns. Customization for Deployment. The system prompt can be modified or overridden to suit specific deployment contexts. Organizations may wish to customize the prompt to: Reflect internal security policies and procedures Emphasize specific areas of cybersecurity relevant to their operations 30 Integrate with existing security workflows and tooling Add organization-specific safety guidelines or usage restrictions We recommend maintaining the core safety guidelines and domain focus when customizing the prompt, as these elements contribute significantly to the models effective and responsible operation."
