            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Modern-day retrievers and rerankers are datahungry, relying on large and high-quality training datasets to accurately retrieve or rerank across challenging domains (Thakur et al., 2021; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; SU et al., 2025). training dataset for information retrieval (IR) typically has multiple instances consisting of training query, labeled positive passages, and set of mined hard negative passages. Sampling hard negatives has been consistently used in retrieval models to improve downstream retrieval accuracy (Karpukhin *Both authors equally contributed in this work. 1 et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021; Moreira et al., 2024, inter alia). More recently, state-of-the-art (SoTA) retrieval models are observed to fine-tune on enormous training dataset sizes. While the general notion is that more training data is better (Chen et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2025), we show the contrary, fine-tuning on select few datasets is rather crucial. For example, removing ELI5 surprisingly improves nDCG@10 on 7 out of 14 of the BEIR datasets (Thakur et al., 2021) and the average nDCG@10 by 0.6 points. similar observation is also made on other training datasets: by pruning 8 out of the 15 datasets in the BGE training collection (Li et al., 2024),1 we improve E5 (base) fine-tuned retrieval model by 1.0 point nDCG@10 on BEIR (as shown in Figure 4). The above observation reveals that there is nonnegligible amount of false or mislabeled data mixed in the current enormous training dataset, which not only adds unnecessary training cost but also hurts the training process. In this work, we propose eliminating the issue from the perspective of false negatives, which are typically introduced by misclassifying unlabeled candidates as negative training examples. This is especially severe for sparsely-annotated retrieval datasets, such as MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) or NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Figure 3 shows an example of false negative present in HOTPOTQA (Yang et al., 2018). Previously, it has been observed that fine-tuning on datasets with false negatives affects the models generalizability (Qu et al., 2021; Moreira et al., 2024; Tao et al., 2024). To avoid false negatives, existing approaches adopted knowledge distillation or hard negative filtering: Qu et al. (2021) distill knowledge from cross-encoder. Moreira et al. (2024) filter poten1The pruned dataset contains only 42.5% pairs of the original dataset, making it 2.35 smaller. Figure 1: Example of training instance (query, ground truth positives, and unlabeled hard negatives) with detected false negatives taken from HOTPOTQA. The false negative passage (Splash Works) is mislabeled as it is relevant in answering the users query. The relevant parts of the text are highlighted in blue. tial false negatives based on relevance score to the query. However, they dont directly tackle the false negative data samples. The former alleviates the issue based on the assumption that the cross-encoder is more robust to false negatives than retrieval models, yet does not remove the false negatives themselves. As we will show in the results section, albeit smaller, inferior training data also negatively affect cross-encoders. The latter alleviates the issue based on the assumption that the relevance scores of false negatives are systematically higher than 95% of the positive scores, which does not consider variance at the level of data samples. In our work, we propose RLHN (ReLabeling Hard Negatives), utilizing cost-effective framework with LLM cascading (Chen et al., 2023) to identify and accurately relabel false negatives (at data sample level) in seven pruned training datasets from the BGE training collection (Li et al., 2024). In the first stage, we use GPT-4o-mini, costeffective LLM, to identify false negatives in all training instances. Next, the detected false negatives are relabeled with more reliable judge, GPT4o. We observe maximum of 56% of training pairs in MS MARCO can contain false negatives, to minimum of about 3% in SCIDOCSRR. The framework is better illustrated in Figure 2. With false negative documents detected, we modify the training datasets in three different ways: (i) remove: discarding the whole training instance, (ii) HN remove: removing only the false hard negatives, and (iii) RLHN: relabeling the false hard negatives as ground truth. Our results show consistently that RLHN setting achieves the highest nDCG@10 scores on BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021) and AIR-BENCH (Yang et al., 2024b), amongst their counterparts with both retrievers: E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B and reranker with Qwen2.5-3B. To better understand the behavior of LLM judgment, we compare LLM judgment with human assessors on 670 randomly sampled queryhard negative pairs. We observe the Cohens Kappa (κ) score of GPT-4o is 10 points higher than GPT-4omini, which echoes their effectiveness in improving training data quality. Lastly, we provide qualitative analysis examining different categories of false negatives identified in training datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that carelessly adopting enormous training data may negatively affect the retriever and reranker model training, and propose solution by focusing on the dataidentifying and relabeling the false hard negatives."

            "content": "Sparsely-annotated datasets. Popular IR training datasets, such as MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), were shallow pooled and sparsely judged by human assessors (Mackenzie et al., 2021; Arabzadeh et al., 2022). The assessor observed few passages from baseline retrieval system, picked those relevant to the query, and labeled them as ground-truth. On the other hand, non-relevant judged passages (i.e., passages seen but preferred lower than the ground truth) were not provided. Therefore, an assumption is made in fine-tuning where remaining passages (in passage corpus) are negatives, and few mined passages similar to the query are labeled as hard negatives. In this work, we avoid relabeling false positives, as these labels are trustworthy, provided by human assessor, who can have different preference than the LLM itself. 2 Figure 2: Flowchart for RLHN (ReLabeling Hard Negatives): (1) Provide the query, ground-truth or positive passages, and hard negative passages from training instance as input, (2) Prompt cost-effective LLM judge (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) and evaluate whether any hard negative is misclassified, (3) If yes, repeat the prompt with an accurate LLM judge (e.g., GPT-4o) (4) Output the relabeled hard negative passages (which are found relevant) and either remove them or relabel them as ground-truth passages in our experiments. LLM-based data curation. Hiring human assessors for judgments is expensive and timeconsuming, and produces limited training pairs, e.g., 1K pairs in LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023). Alternatively, LLMs as judges have been recently explored for dataset curation in tasks, such as instruction fine-tuning (Chen et al., 2024b; Chen and Mueller, 2024), or even code-generation (Jain et al., 2024). False negatives. Qu et al. (2021) first noted the issue of false negatives in retrieval, where certain hard negative passages should have been classified as positives. However, instead of curating the training datasets, RocketQA (Qu et al., 2021) fine-tuned models by distilling knowledge from the cross-encoder label. Similarly, Moreira et al. (2024) examined various filtering methods for negative sampling by avoiding very hard negatives. Lee et al. (2024, 2025b) use an LLM such as Gemini to relabel positive passages and identify better hard negatives, but they do not provide further qualitative analysis on its effectiveness or publicly share their information or training datasets."

We utilize the original BGE training dataset5 (Li et al., 2024), comprehensive collection with training datasets for retrieval (e.g., NQ, MS MARCO), clustering (e.g., TwentyNewsgroups), and classification (e.g., AmazonReviews) tasks. Many of these training datasets are used in fine-tuning of popular retriever models such as E5-Mistral (Wang et al., 2024), GRITLM (Muennighoff et al., 2024), Linq (Choi et al., 2024), LLM2Vec (BehnamGhader et al., 2024), CDE (Morris and Rush, 2025), or NV-Embed (Lee et al., 2025a).

We evaluate the retrieval and reranker accuracy of the models finetuned on datasets with false negatives either removed or relabeled with RLHN on the BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021) and AIR-BENCH (Yang et al., 2024b). Both benchmarks evaluate retrieval accuracy in nDCG@10. BEIR contains humanconstructed datasets, and AIR-BENCH contains datasets automatically generated by LLMs without human intervention. In BEIR, we drop Quora and CQADupstack and evaluate on the remaining 16 datasets. In AIR-BENCH (version 24.05), we evaluate five specific domains in English-only: Arxiv, Finance, Healthcare, Law, and News. Backbone models. We use the E5 (base) unsupervised6 (Wang et al., 2022b, 2024), BERT-based encoder, due to its high accuracy on BEIR (preliminary results in Appendix A), the inclusion of pre-training stage, and lower training complexity.

Results in Table 2 show that in both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B, the RLHN technique achieves the best overall average nDCG@10 of 0.515 and 0.518 on 16 datasets on BEIR, outperforming models trained in the default setting and remove techniques. The relabeled data in RLHN improves model generalization, with improvements strongly visible in seven out-of-domain (OOD) datasets in BEIR. Stage 1 (RLHN) outperforms the default setting by 2.0 points and Stage 2 (RLHN) by 3.2 points in nDCG@10. Overall, relabeling false negatives improves the data quality, which is quite visible in model generalization across out-ofdomain settings in BEIR. AIR-BENCH. In addition to BEIR, AIR-BENCH provides zero-shot setting to evaluate on challenging domains, such as Law. Table 3 shows the average nDCG@10 on five specialized domains. We also confirm that the improvements in model generalization are similar to what we observed in BEIR. Stage 1 (RLHN) setting improves the default setting by 1.1 point nDCG@10, and Stage 2 (RLHN) further improves by 2.1 points nDCG@10.

            "content": "Robustness of RLHN across varying training data subsets. As training datasets can be large, effectively relabeling using the LLM cascading pipeline to label all training pairs can be prohibitive. Therefore, from Figure 5, we demonstrate that RLHN remains robust and shows similar accuracy gains, even for smaller randomly sampled subsets of the training dataset. To test this, we conducted four random subsets (100K, 250K, 400K, and 680K) of the training datasets, with each dataset distribution shown in Table 8. Overall, we have two main findings here: (i) E5 (base) model fine-tuned on RHLN Stages 1 and 2 training data with false hard negatives relabeled as positives outperforms the default setting consistently, and (ii) the higher slope in nDCG@10 demonstrates the continual improvement across zero-shot domains with increasing amounts of training data, especially as observed in AIR-BENCH. Figure 5: nDCG@10 scores on BEIR (Avg. 16 and Avg. 7) and AIR-BENCH (Avg. 5) by fine-tuning E5 (base) on subset of the 100K, 250K, 400K, and 680K training pairs using the RLHN technique for both stages.

P@L(GT) calculates the precision of false negatives present in top-k reranked results, where varies in each query, measuring the count of false negatives detected using RLHN. Reranker distillation is competitive, but lacks in detecting false negatives. reranker or crossencoder is used in knowledge distillation to finetune retriever model as an alternative to the traditional contrastive or InfoNCE loss function (Hofstätter et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a). This technique bypasses the original relevance judgments, relying on knowledge within the reranker. Instead of relying on RLHN, we evaluate how well existing rerankers detect false negatives in training datasets. To achieve this, we rerank the hard negatives present in each training instance, and compute two metrics: (i) mAP@10, measuring the average precision of false negatives in the top-10 results, and (ii) P@L(GT), measuring the precision of false negatives present in the top-k results, where is the count of false negatives. Table 5 shows results by six reranker judges from various sources on four datasets. We observe bge-reranker-v2-gemma judge achieves the highest scores amongst its counterparts, to identify false negatives labeled by RLHN (except FiQA-2018). However, on datasets such as FIQA-2018 and HOTPOTQA, rerankers can only identify 52.563.8% false negatives, indicating that existing rerankers are competitive, but still require improvement. We suspect that rerankers are fine-tuned on these existing training datasets containing false negatives, which hurt their model accuracy."

As shown in Table 7, we observe different variety of false negatives, which can be one of the following scenarios: 1. Detected false negatives are incorrect or not relevant. GPT-4o can detect false negative, not relevant to the query. E.g., (Q1) query asks which is food magazine, within Latin Mass or Saveur, however, the false negatives identify different food magazines such as Food & Wine or Cochina, which are both incorrect. 2. The ground truth may be incorrectly labeled. In limited number of queries, we observe that the ground truth passage can have conflicting information with the false negative, and can be incorrectly labeled. E.g., the correct answer to the (Q2) query asking about the professional ice hockey establishment is 1917, present within the false negative, and 1997, mentioned in the ground truth, is incorrect. 3. The query may be too generic or ambiguous. In substantial amount of training pairs in MS MARCO, we observe that the training query is rather ambiguous, leading to many false negatives being detected. E.g., all passages are relevant to the (Q3) query, including both the ground truth and false negatives, define yin and yang correctly in different interpretation. 4. False negatives detected can be partially correct. Not all detected false negatives are relevant to the query. E.g., one of the false negatives is partially relevant to the query (Q4) about Charles or the Prince of Wales organizations."

            "content": "In this work, we emphasize the importance of clean training datasets. First, we showed that certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness when fine-tuned across huge collection with many training pairs. Dataset pruning removes 57.5% (8 datasets out of 15) and improves the model accuracy on BEIR by even 1.0 point and making the dataset 2.35 smaller. Next, after pruning, we observed the issue of false hard negatives in the remaining training datasets, where passages in the hard negative list are misclassified and are relevant to the query. We presented RLHN, an effective cascading LLM approach for relabeling hard negatives as ground truth or positives. Using RLHN, retrievers and rerankers were finetuned, and they consistently improved in model generalization, without any other modifications in the training settings on both BEIR and zero-shot AIR-Bench evaluations. We have released our modified training datasets and code. We will continue cleaning other popular training datasets to promote its use by the community and highlight the critical role of data quality in fine-tuning retrieval and reranker models."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Even though we propose an effective technique to identify and relabel false hard negatives with RLHN, no technique is perfect and has its limitations. Making those explicit is critical point in understanding the RLHN results and improvements, and for future work, to propose even better detection techniques. 1. False positives in training datasets. Detecting and relabeling false positives in training datasets is an important avenue of potential research. However, we avoid checking for false positives, as these labels are trustworthy, provided by human assessor, who can have different preference than the LLM itself. False positives might occur in dataset due to human errors in existing datasets, but we suspect both the importance and frequency of detected false positives to be much lower than false negatives. 2. Cleaning extremely large training datasets. The maximum training dataset size that we covered in our work contained 1M training pairs. This is reasonable dataset size to apply RLHN within strict compute budget. Cleaning extremely large training datasets (for example, containing between 110M training pairs) is not feasible, as it may require very high computation budget, with detection using GPT-4o. In the future, we wish to experiment with open-sourced LLMs, such as Qwen-3 (Yang et al., 2025), as an alternative in our LLM cascading pipeline, allowing relabeling of extremely large training datasets. 3. Multilingual and long-context document retrieval datasets. majority of the training datasets included in the BGE training collection have average document lengths up to few hundred words, roughly equivalent to few paragraphs. Applying RLHN to clean long-context document retrieval datasets, such as MLDR (Chen et al., 2024a) and multilingual training datasets, such as MIRACL (Zhang et al., 2023), would be highly relevant in the future. 4. Multi-vector retrieval models. popular suite of retrieval models includes multi-vector models, such as ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020; Santhanam et al., 2022), representing queries and documents by multiple contextualized token-level embeddings. In our work, we limited our experiments to dense retrievers and rerankers. We keep RLHN with an extension to multi-vector models as future work, using training repository such as PyLate (Chaffin and Sourty, 2024)."

            "content": "We experimented with several pretrained or base model choices. In particular, we focused on finetuning recently introduced encoder models such as ModernBERT (Warner et al., 2024) to decoderbased large language models such as Qwen-2.5 (less than <500M parameters). We fine-tune each backbone on the whole BGE retrieval training subset (15 datasets & 1.6M training pairs) for up to 3 training epochs with different hyperparameters to fit the training with 4xA6000 GPUs. We plot the model configurations and training settings in Table 9. Validation results. From Table 9, we observe that encoder models pre-trained such as E5-base or E5large achieve the highest nDCG@10 scores on four BEIR datasets. These outperform recent backbones such as ModernBERT-base (Warner et al., 2024) or even smaller-sized LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 (0.5B). This anecdotally confirms that the unsupervised pre-training stage in E5 pretrained models is useful and necessary for achieving competitive nDCG@10 score on BEIR. Since fine-tuning E5 (large) is around 2 slower than fine-tuning E5 (base), we run our main experiments on E5 (base) due to computational budget constraints."

Your task is to evaluate whether any of the unrelated documents are relevant compared to the ground-truth document in answering the question. document is only considered relevant to the question if it provides sufficient information in answering the question. ## Input You will receive: 1. question: The question that the to-be-judged documents will be evaluated on. 2. ground_truth: pre-validated document judged as most relevant to the question. This document can answer the question and should be used as guide for your analysis. 3. documents: set of unrelated documents which may not be relevant in answering the question. You will first read the question and carefully analyze each unrelated documents provided to you. Read every question and unrelated document carefully as you would when proofreading. ## Criteria Use the following criteria to judge the relevance of each document: - Relevant: document is considered relevant to the question if it provides sufficient information in answering the question, containing all necessary parts highlighted in the ground truth. - Not Relevant: The document does not answer the question and does not provide information in entailing parts present in the ground truth. ## Output Follow these detailed steps and output your reasoning for each step wrapped for each respective XML tag below: 1. You should think and provide your reasoning under <thinking> [ . . . ] </thinking> on why and how if an unrelated document is relevant following the criteria above. 2. Next, for all unrelated documents which are found to be relevant, compare them against the ground truth (<ground_truth>) document in answering the question under <preference> [ . . . ] </preference> tokens. 3. Finally, output the list of documents which are (1) relevant and (2) prefer better or equal under the XML tag (<better>) or worse (<worse>) than the ground truth (<ground_truth>) document for answering the question in <verdict> [ . . . ] </verdict>. Output [ ] if none of the documents are found to be relevant. Follow strictly the format below: <thinking> Evaluate the reasoning individually for all unrelated documents to answer the question Doc (1): output the reasoning here Doc (2): output the reasoning here . . . </thinking> <preference> Compare the ground truth and every relevant document individually to answer the question Doc (1): compare the relevance of Doc (1) with the <ground_truth> document here, which is more preferred? . . . </preference> <verdict> <better> Preferred over or equally as ground truth: [Doc (2) . . . ] </better>, <worse> Relevant but not preferred over ground truth: [Doc (1) . . . ] </worse> </verdict> <question> {question} </question> <ground_truth> {ground_truth} </ground_truth> <documents> {documents} </documents> Figure 6: Prompt used in RLHN with GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o for relabeling hard negatives for all BGE training datasets.
