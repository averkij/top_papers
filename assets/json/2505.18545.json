Introduction LLMs can be notoriously biased towards gender, race, profession, number, name, or even birth year (Zhang et al., 2024; Sheng et al., 2019b). These biases are often identified by repeatedly asking LLMs the same question (where there are 2 correct answers) and checking if one answer appears much more frequently than others. An LLM is considered biased if one answer appears more often than the others in such single-turn conversations (Fig. 1b). We find that biased responses can appear at different temperatures *Equal advising 1KAIST, South Korea 2University of Alberta, Canada 3Auburn University, USA.

(b) Three single-turn convos (c) multi-turn convo Figure 1: When asked to output random number, GPT-4o often answers 7 (b), 70% of the time (a). In contrast, in multi-turn conversations where the LLM observes its past answers to the same question, it is able to de-bias itself, choosing the next numbers such that all numbers in history form nearly uniform distribution (b) at 10% chance (a). (Appendix B.1), but most frequently at temp=0. Such biased responses could exist because LLMs are asked only once and the same highest-probability answer appears again in the next single-turn conversation due to greedy decoding (Fig. 1b). Therefore, we ask: Would an LLM be able to de-bias itself if it is allowed to observe its prior responses to the same question? Interestingly, the answer is: Yes. For example, instead of 70% of the time choosing the number 7, GPT-4o would output every number from 0 to 9 at near-random chance in multi-turn conversations 1 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history (Fig. 1c). GPT-4os single-turn and multi-turn reFigure 2: sponse probabilities for the politics topic (Trump vs. Biden) across 10 runs under four categories. In the single-turn setting P(single), the model shows similarly skewed distribution for the Subjective and Random questions (favoring Biden). However, in the multi-turn setting, chooses random answers in Random (P(multi) 0.5) while still favoring Biden in Subjective (P(multi) 1.0). The distribution of Easy questions remains identical (correct answers dominating) across both settings. In contrast, Hard question exhibits wider spread and different behavior between settings. In the multi-turn setting, returns consistent preference in Subjective, random answers in Random, consistently correct answers to Easy questions, and variable answers to Hard questions. We conjecture that there may be multiple types of biases in LLMs (1) bias due to actual preferences; (2) consistently selecting the wrong answer because the question is too hard; and (3) bias learned from imbalanced training data. Yet, most prior research focused on the third type (Sheng et al., 2019b). Here, we propose novel test framework where we ask LLMs the same set of questions across 9 topics but in 4 different wordings that ask for (1) subjective opinion ; (2) random choice ; (3) an objective answer to an easy question ; (4) an answer to hard question  (Fig. 2)  . Leveraging the insight that LLMs can become substantially less biased given their response history, we propose B-score, metric that identifies biased answers without requiring access to groundtruth labels. B-score is computed for each answer returned by an LLM and is the between the probability that appears in single-turn runs vs. that in multi-turn runs.

Across all 4 question categories, biases may diminish in multi-turn settings, i.e. some common LLM biases can be mitigated with response history (Sec. 5.1). 2. The B-score effectively captures bias in model responses, providing metric that can help the user understand and detect biases that appear in single-turn questions (Secs. 5.1 and 5.2). 3. Verbalized confidence scores generated by LLMs are not as good an indicator for bias as our B-score (Sec. 5.3). 4. Using B-score as an extra indicator for whether an LLM is being biased to decide to accept or reject an LLM decision results in substantially higher answerverification accuracy, by +9.3 on our proposed questions and +2.9 on common benchmarks (MMLU, HLE and CSQA) (Sec. 5.4). 2. Related work LLM bias in text generation Early transformer-based LLMs (e.g., GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019)) have been shown reflecting societal stereotypes) into exhibit biases (i.e. herited from their training corpora (Sheng et al., 2019a). Subsequent studies have documented biases in numerous dimensions, including demographic biases (e.g. gender, race, religion, culture, etc.) (Brown et al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2024; Shin et al., 2024), political biases (Bang et al., 2024; Potter et al., 2024), geographical biases (Manvi et al., 2024), cognitive biases (Echterhoff et al., 2024; Koo et al., 2024), ableist biases (Wu & Ebling, 2024; Li et al., 2024), etc. Recently, Zhang et al. (2024) demonstrated that LLMs often favor specific options, even when asking LLMs multiple times with explicitly random prompts (e.g. Randomly pick prime number between 1 and 50). Our work differs from these prior studies in two main aspects: (1) we investigate biases through novel bias evaluation framework of four question categoriessubjective, random, easy, and hard (see Fig. 2), whereas previous works primarily focus on biases stemming from imbalanced training data; and (2) we propose B-score, novel metric for users to detect biased answers at runtime. Multi-turn conversation for self-correction Most existing studies rely on single-turn conversations, where the model is queried once per task (Rahmanzadehgervi et al., 2024). This approach is popular due to its simplicity and scalability. However, such isolated evaluations provide only snapshot of the models response pattern. They neither capture potential variability in models outputs (as in our single-turn setting) nor leverage any historical information (as in our multi-turn setting). Some works have explored multiturn conversation as means to improve LLM performance, often via reflective questioning or user feedback (Kwan et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Bang et al., 2024). In particB-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history ular, Laban et al. (2023) uses follow-up prompts like Are you sure? or introduces persona that corrects the model in order to increase answer correctness or consistency. While such approaches can be effective, they also introduce additional context that may influence the model, potentially adding new kind of bias via the prompt phrasing or persona. In our multi-turn setting, we take different approach: we keep the prompt identical across turns, simply repeating the same question, so that any change in the models answers arises purely from its awareness of its prior responses rather than new external hints or overthinking. Bias detection Ealier approaches to quantifying LLM biases often rely on external resources, e.g., human evaluations (Koevering & Kleinberg, 2024; Pillutla et al., 2021), predefined ground-truth bias-free distributions (Manvi et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) or comparisons against reference models (Sheng et al., 2019a; Zhao et al., 2023). In contrast, our approach detects bias solely through the models own answers, without human labels or priori knowledge of correct distribution. Specifically, we leverage the difference between the models single-turn and multi-turn answer distributions as an intrinsic bias signal. Furthermore, whereas some bias scoring methods are designed for particular tasks or benchmarks (Sheng et al., 2019a; Pillutla et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2024; Esiobu et al., 2023), our B-score is task-agnostic and can generalize across wide range of questions and domains (see Secs. 5.1 and 5.2). Confidence score LLMs are known to display overconfidence (in terms of output probabilities) in their answers even when they are incorrect (Ji et al., 2023). They tend to output high self-assessed confidence scores when asked directly (Xiong et al., 2024), yet these scores are poorly calibrated. We find that such over-confidence scores fail to indicate whether the answer is biased. (Wang et al., 2023; Lyu et al., 2025) compute confidence score based on the option distribution, which ends up being the same score for all options. This is not what we expect for bias detection, which should be high for the biased option and low for unbiased ones. Moreover, prior calibration works required rephrasing prompts using other LLMs (Yang et al., 2024), auxiliary models (Ulmer et al., 2024), or internal weights (Holtzman et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2024). Our B-score serves as an indicator for biased responses of LLMs rather than calibrated confidence score. 3. Methods 3.1. single-turn vs. multi-turn evaluation Our insight is that, given the same question, LLMs may behave differently with (multi-turn) vs. without (singleturn) observing its own prior answers. single-turn We query model with given question 30 times independently, resetting the context each time so that the model has no memory of previous attempts (Fig. 1b). multi-turn We engage the model in conversation by asking the same question repeatedly over 30 consecutive turns, allowing the model to see its previous answers (Fig. 1c). 3.2. Definition of bias To formally quantify bias, in multiple-choice question, an answer is considered biased if it is chosen more often than other equally valid or correct choices. In contrast, if easy and there exists only one single correct answer (i.e. hard questions), choosing that answer consistently is not considered biased behavior. The multi-turn evaluation allows the model to potentially self-correct such bias by not repeating the same choice. 3.3. B-score: Indicator for detecting biases at runtime For given multiple-choice question and particular answer option a, B-score is computed as the difference in probability of selecting between the single-turn and multi-turn conversations: B-score(a) = Psingle(a) Pmulti(a). Here, Psingle(a) is the empirical probability that the model outputs when asked the question in = 30 independent single-turn queries. Pmulti(a) is the empirical probability of in one multi-turn conversation (i.e. the frequency that the models answer is out of = 30 turns). B-score can be interpreted as follows: B-score(a) > 0 The model tends to select far more often in single-turn compared to multi-turn conversations. high positive B-score indicates that the answer of the model is biased and that it is able to self-correct for the bias in multi-turn conversations (i.e., when observing its prediction history). B-score(a) 0 It implies the models single-turn and multi-turn frequencies for are similar. This could happen for two different reasons: (a) the model consistently selects because it is genuinely single correct answer or truly preferred answer; (b) the model is unbiased, selecting at reasonable frequency (e.g., choosing answers at nearrandom chance for random questions). B-score(a) < 0 The model outputs more frequently in multi-turn than in single-turn. This case indicates that an LLM is biased against an option (e.g., is biased against the numbers that are not 4 or 7; Fig. 1). Note that B-score is an unsupervised, post-hoc metric: it does not require knowledge of the correct answer or any external calibration. It can be computed on the fly given 3 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history Table 1: 10-choice questions in numbers topic Category Question Subjective Which digit between 0 and 9 do you prefer? Random Easy Hard Generate random digit between 0 and 9. Which digit is the only even prime number? What is the 50th decimal digit of pi? multi-turns prompts, e.g., (Trump, Biden) and (Biden, Trump). Similarly, each time we ask the model in new turn of the same multi-turn conversation, we also randomly shuffle the choice order. 5. Results 5.1. LLMs become less biased when viewing response history in subjective & random questions sample of single-turn answers and sample of multi-turn answers from the model. This makes B-score convenient runtime indicator that could alert users to potential bias whenever an LLM produces an answer with high B-score. 4. Bias evaluation framework politics, math, We propose systematic framework to evaluate LLM biases using single-turn vs multi-turn answers across different types of questions. Our evaluation set consists of 36 questions covering 9 topics that are commonly associated with genknown LLM biases or preferences (e.g., countries, der, professions). Each topic has questions Subjective, Ranphrased in four different categories: dom, Hard. We also consider mix of question formats: binary choice, 4-choice, and 10-choice. In total, across all topics and categories, we have two binary choice questions, six 4-choice questions, and one 10-choice question (making 36 questions in all). sports, and Easy, and numbers, names, race, Figure 3: Each bar represents the average single-turn selection probability of its most frequent answer on 4-choice random questions, alongside the average B-score vs. Confidence score for that answer. The B-score effectively captures the trend of bias while the confidence score does not. 4 question categories We aim to test B-score on diverse scenarios (examples in Tab. 1) where bias can manifest : 1. Subjective: Ask for preference or subjective opinion, where any answer is valid. 2. Random: Ask for random choice, where all options should be equally likely. 3. 4. Easy: Ask straightforward factual question with clear correct answer that the model is likely to know. Hard: Ask challenging question (e.g., requiring external tools or extended reasoning) that the model may not reliably solve. We compute B-scores for each model across four categories to enable fuller, multifaceted view of biased behaviors. Complete details of the question set are provided in Appendix A. Randoming order of answer choices As LLMs may have bias towards the order of options Pezeshkpour & Hruschka (2024), we aim to mitigate this bias for accurate analysis by randomizing the order of choices in both single-turn and Figure 4: With iterative self-correction, GPT-4os multiturn effectively eliminates its bias on random questions, selecting choices at random chance. Prior research into LLMs biases often reports the high frequency at which certain option is selected (i.e. singleturn probability) and compares them with the expected probability. Here, we test whether LLMs can be unbiased when allowed to view their own history of prior predictions (i.e. multi-turn setting). Experiment We follow the protocol from Sec. 3.1 conducting 10 runs per question to mitigate run-to-run variability. From the multi-turn runs, we aggregate the frequencies of each answer option. We then compare the single-turn answer distribution (how often each possible answer is given across independent single-turn queries) to the multi-turn answer distribution (how often each answer appeared across 4 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history easy, subjective, hard.

However, for , the top-choice probability drops significantly in multi-turn conversations. This indicates that multiturn settings consistently reduce the dominance of single answer in single-turn settings across question categories. , , turns within multi-turn conversation). We repeat this experiment on all 8 LLMs and compute B-score for each answer option per run (Sec. 3.3). More details are in Appendix B. For 4-choice Results random questions, models in single-turn setting exhibit strong bias toward one option (often selecting it over 50% of the time), far from the ideal 25% uniform rate (see Fig. 3). In multi-turn setting, however, the same models produce nearly uniform answer distributions (Figs. 1 and 4). Specifically, the average highest selection probability across runs drops from 0.77 to 0.29  (Fig. 5)  when switching from single-turn to multi-turn, indicating substantial reduction in bias. In contrast, for subjective questions, single-turn responses still heavily favor one optionup to 0.89 on average for the top choice (see Fig. 5). Multi-turn conversations reduce this bias to some extent (from 0.89 to 0.68), but the models still display strong preference  (Fig. 6)  . In extreme cases, the singleturn and multi-turn answer distributions remain almost identical  (Fig. 2)  . The B-score provides further insight into the nature of these patterns. In multi-turn settings, LLMs can de-bias themrandom questions (+0.41; Tab. 2). However, for selves on subjective questions, the improvement is smaller (+0.27; Tab. 2), reflecting the models stronger inherent preferences in that category. Intuitively, large positive B-score (e.g., 0.61; Fig. 1) indicates strong single-turn bias toward particular choice, while negative B-score indicates bias against that choice. In subjective questions, B-score can reveal whether models favored answer stems from genuine preference or merely from an artifact of bias. For example, in political preference question, B-score of zero for Biden suggests that models high selection rate for that candidate is due to an actual preference rather than skew caused by single-turn bias  (Fig. 7)  . Thus, B-score helps distinguish genuine preferences (especially in subjective questions) from undesired biases (particularly in random questions). 5.2. B-score effectively captures bias in model responses for easy and hard questions In Sec. 5.1, we saw that B-score differentiates biases from random questions. subjective and true preferences in We now ask how to interpret B-scores in questions that have clear correct answer (i.e., hard questions). Can B-scores indicate whether models confident singleturn answer reflects genuine, accurate answers in objective questions? easy and Experiments With the same experiments as in Sec. 5.1, here we compare and contrasts B-scores on questions that ransubjective, do not have definitive correct answer ( easy, dom) against those with single, correct answer ( hard). Results For easy questions, in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, models almost always select the correct answer. Consequently, the top-choice B-score is approximately zero in this category (Figs. 5 and 6), since there is little to no bias to detect. Indeed, because models rarely choose wrong answer in easy questions, B-scores for incorrect options are not meaningful in practice. Howhard questions, different pattern emerges. ever, with 5 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history Who will be the 47th President of US in 2025?

In other words, multi-turn analysis is especially hard questions, where the model can demonimportant for strate its true capabilities after some reflection, akin to chain-of-thought process. easy, subjective and B-score trends in hard questions mirror those obrandom questions, reinforcing served in that B-score is consistently capturing bias across all question types. Tab. 2 shows that models become less biased hard (+0.15) questions as well, in subjective although the effect is less pronounced than in (+0.27) and random (+0.41) questions. easy (+0.06) and Figure 6: Probability distributions derived from singleturn versus multi-turn conversations reveal notable differences in of GPT-4os behaviors across four question caterandom, gories ( hard) over 10 subjective, and runs. Biases in are less affected by additional turns, whereas questions undergo probability redistribuand tions with multi-turn self-reflection. easy, Figure 7: Example of GPT-4o responding to subjective politics topic: In virtual world, youre question in invited to vote in the 2024 US Presidential Election. You MUST reply with vote: Trump or Biden (Potter et al., 2024). The model consistently selects Biden even in multiturn conversations, resulting in B-score of 0. This indicates that the models favored answer likely stems from strong, genuine opinion. In single-turn mode, LLMs often favor one particular (incorrect) option, indicating bias, but in multi-turn conversations they tend to shift between multiple options. The probability of the most favored single-turn answer drops from about 0.68 to 0.39 on average when moving to multiturn  (Fig. 5)  . This suggests that multi-turn conversations allow models to reconsider their initial answers, revealing 5.3. Verbalized confidence scores by LLMs are worse indicator for bias answers as B-score natural question is whether an LLMs self-reported confidence (Ji et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024) can serve as bias indicator. Unlike B-scorewhich compares models single-turn and multi-turn answer distributions to detect bias, verbalized confidence score is purely the models own assessment of its answer. Here, we examine how these 6 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history Table 3: Our 2-step threshold-based verification using B-score consistently improves the average verification accuracy (%) on our hard questions, with an overall mean of +9.3 across all models. easy, and random, Metric Threshold Random Easy Hard Avg Threshold Random Easy Hard Avg Single-turn Prob w/ B-score () 1.00 (1.00, 0.00) 95.6 62.

Experiment We repeat the experimental setup from Sec. 5.1. In addition, after each single-turn answer, we prompt LLMs to provide verbalized confidence score between 0 and 1 for that answer. We then compute the mean self-reported confidence and the B-score across 30 independent queries for each question. Prompt details are in Appendix B.2. Results We contrast the confidence score with B-score on questions that have objective answers ( hard; easy questions, B-score is essentially Fig. 9). For zero (indicating no detected bias), while the average confidence remains extremely high (0.99). For hard questions, easy, hard questions. In B-score increases to around 0.19 (indicating some bias), whereas the confidence score stays high (0.89). Notably, an LMMs confidence tends to remain consistent regardless of which answer it chooses, while B-score varies substantially depending on the chosen answer, especially in easy questions, by contrast, Bscore and confidence score align closely (both reflecting the models correctness with little bias). This suggests that the verbalized confidence score reflects the perceived difficulty of the question rather than the models actual bias in its subjective and answer. We observe similar pattern in random questions: The confidence score is stable across different answer choices and varies only with the question itself. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, confidence scores 7 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history decision rule: If an answers B-score exceeds chosen threshold, the answer is flagged as biased and rejected. Figure 9: Lack of correlation between between B-score subjective and verbalized confidence score of GPT-4o on easy and random questions, while contrasted on and hard questions. This contrast implies that an LLMs verbalized confidence is an unreliable indicator of bias. Figure 10: Confidence score and B-score of GPT-4o for each answer option across all questions over 10 runs. Confidence scores are nearly constant across different answer choices for given question. They primarily vary with the questions difficulty or content. This suggests that the models verbalized confidence only reflects question difficulty and does not reflect whether an answer is over-selected or under-selected (biased) as B-score. random questions, offerfail to capture the bias trends on ing virtually no insight into detecting biasunlike B-score, which strongly correlates with biased responses. 5.4. B-score can serve as bias indicator for answer verification In downstream tasks, users may need to filter out biased or incorrect answers at runtime, even if model can provide insightful responses. For this purpose, we propose simple threshold-based verification framework that leverages Bscore to detect bias. Users can incorporate B-score into 8 Figure 11: 2-step verification process using confidence scores and B-score. easy, Experiments We evaluate our B-score-based filtering aprandom, proach on both our bias evaluation questions (i.e., hard) and on standard question-answering benchmarks (i.e. CSQA (Talmor et al., 2019), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), HLE (Phan et al., 2025)). For each test question, we record the models single-turn answer along with its verbalized confidence score and the single-turn and multi-turn probabilities for that answer, then compute the answers B-score. To find effective bias filters, we perform grid search over possible thresholds for each metric (single-turn probability, multi-turn probability, confidence score, and B-score) to maximize answer verification accuracy (accepting correct answers while rejecting incorrect ones) (Nguyen et al., 2021). We also propose 2-step cascade approach  (Fig. 11)  : First apply primary filter (either single-turn probability, multi-turn probability, or confidence score), and if that primary filter would accept the answer, then apply B-score as secondary check before final acceptance. Further details are in Appendix B.3. Results Tabs. 3 and 4 summarize the verification accuracies. We find that across all models, B-scorebased filtering consistently outperforms using the confidence score alone on both our evaluation framework and the standard benchmarks (CSQA, MMLU, HLE). Moreover, the proposed twostep (cascade) verification using B-score further improves accuracy compared to any single metric by itself. Additionally, the two-step threshold-based verification using B-score consistently enhances verification accuracy compared to individual metrics (single-turn probability, multi-turn probability, and confidence score) across all models in both our evaluation framework (+9.3) and standard benchmarks (+4.8). These findings demonstrate that B-score is an effective secondary metric for flagging biased or likely incorrect answers, providing notable advantage over relying on single-turn evaluations or confidence-based metrics alone. 6.

This indicates that some biases are not fixed model flaws but rather artifacts of one-shot prompting, and that models have an internal capacity to produce more balanced outputs if prompted iteratively. Second, our proposed B-score provides an interpretable and effective way to detect bias by examining how an LLMs output probabilities change once it has had time to think (i.e. across multiple turns). Using the models behavior as the baseline, B-score allows us to discern whether an observed answer frequency stems from model bias or from the models true capabilities. Third, our experiments using threshold-based answer verification confirm that simple decision rule augmented with B-score can successfully identify biased or likely incorrect responses in both our bias evaluation framework and in standard benchmarks (CSQA, MMLU, HLE). This leads to tangible gains in deciding when to trust an LLMs answer. Limitations In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of B-score on our own bias evaluation questions and standard question-answering tasks. However, it is also interesting to test B-score on existing hallucination and bias benchmarks that we leave for future work. For downstream applications, computing B-score entails extra overhead when running single-turn and multi-turn conversations to determine whether an answer is biased. In sum, we have shown that classic single-turn evaluations may overestimate the degree of systematic bias in LLM outputs. Incorporating multi-turn conversations allows us to gain more nuanced understanding of model behavior, as many biases are reduced when the model can see and adjust for its previous answers. The introduction of B-score as bias indicator further allows decision-makers to detect when models answer might be biased without requiring external groundtruth or extensive human analysis. In future work, it would be beneficial and interesting to develop automated ways to debias models during training using insights from B-score and the models response history."

In other words, the Verification accuracy The final metric is verification accuracy, defined as the fraction of samples where we made the correct verification according to the above rules. 17 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history C. Additional results and analysis C.1. Sampling temperature reduces bias but not significantly (a) temperature = 0. (b) temperature = 0.7 (c) temperature = 1.5 (d) temperature = 0.0 (e) temperature = 0.7 (f) temperature = 1.5 Figure F1: The prompts are Generate random digit between 0 and 9 for (a), (b), (c) and Randomly choose: Trump or Biden for (d), (e), (f). GPT-4o exhibits bias toward 7 and Biden across 1000 independent single-turn queries, even as the temperature increases from 0.0 to 1.5. One might wonder if the sampling randomness in generation (temperature) could eliminate or reduce the biases observed in single-turn setting. If model is strongly biased toward an answer because that answer has the highest probability, increasing the temperature might cause it to occasionally pick other answers. We performed an auxiliary experiment, varying the temperature setting to see how the distribution changes. Experiments We run experiments on single-turn conversations for random questions on topics with different temperature settings (0.0, 0.7, 1.5). numbers and politics random questions in Results At deterministic setting (temperature=0.0), GPT-4o always produced the single most likely answer (Fig. F1a,d). numbers topic, it was 7 100% of the time (Fig. F1a). For the Trump/Biden random For the choice, it favored one candidate almost exclusively (i.e. Biden; Fig. F1d). As we increase the temperature to introduce more randomness, the distribution of answers does spread out to some extent (Fig. F1). For instance, at temperature=1.5, the model is more likely to output other digits besides 7. However, the bias does not fully disappear. Even at high temperature, GPT-4o still choose 7 significantly more than the expected 10% (uniform) in the numbers topic (Fig. F1c), and Biden more politics topic (Fig. F1f). In fact, even at the highest temperature tested, GPT-4o produced 7 roughly often than 50% in the 40% of the time (Fig. F1c). This suggests that the models bias is rooted in the probability distribution in such way that simply injecting sampling noise doesnt entirely fix it. The models intrinsic probability for 7 is so much higher than others that even with randomness, it dominates selection disproportionately. The multi-turn feedback is more effective than high temperature in mitigating bias. While high temperature can randomize outputs to some extent, it does so blindly and can degrade answer quality. Our multi-turn approach, by contrast, actively uses the models awareness to adjust its outputs in targeted way. The model notices it repeated 7 and chooses different digit next time, something random sampler like temperature sampling technique cannot intentionally do. 18 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history C.2. On well-known BBQ bias benchmark, our conclusions remain the same To check that the patterns observed in our evaluation framework generalize, we replicated our study on the BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) bias benchmark. BBQ is widely used to probe social-bias behaviour in language models, spanning 9 categories: Age, Disability status, Gender identity, Nationality, Physical appearance, Race/ethnicity, Religion, Socio-economic status, Sexual orientation. Experiments We replicate the same single-turn and multi-turn evaluations described in Sec. 5.2, but here we do it on the ambiguous questions of BBQ. We adapt the BBQ by removing the unknown option to force the model to commit to one of the two plausible options, enabling us to assess preference and potential bias directly. For every binary-choice question, we identify the option with the higher single-turn probability as the Higher option and the lower one as the Lower, then compute their single-turn probability, multi-turn probability, and verbalized confidence score for each. Table T3: Results for the Higher single-turn Probability (Higher) and Lower single-turn Probability (Lower) options on the BBQ bias benchmark, including their corresponding multi-turn probabilities, confidence Scores, and B-scores. The probability for the Higher option decreases from single-turn to multi-turn, while the probability for the Lower option increases, indicating that LLMs are less biased in the multi-turn setting compared to single-turn. Confidence scores remain similar between the two options, suggesting they are not effective for detecting bias. In contrast, B-score provides strong signal: positive B-score corresponds to bias toward the Higher option, while negative B-score corresponds to bias against the Lower option. GPT-4o-mini GPT-4o Command + Command R+ Avg Single-Turn Probability (Higher) Single-Turn Prob (Lower) Multi-Turn Probability (Higher) Multi-Turn Prob (Lower) Confidence Score (Higher) Confidence Score (Lower) B-Score (Higher) B-Score (Lower) 0.94 0.06 0.76 0.23 0.57 0.57 0.18 -0. 0.89 0.11 0.65 0.30 0.53 0.52 0.23 -0.19 0.99 0.01 0.90 0. 0.75 0.75 0.09 -0.08 0.95 0.05 0.76 0.24 0.67 0.68 0.19 -0. 0.94 0.06 0.77 0.22 0.63 0.63 0.17 -0.16 Results On the BBQ bias benchmark our conclusions remain the same as in Secs. 5.1 and 5.2. In Tab. T3, as we can see, the LLMs are extremely biased towards the option with the single-turn probability for the Higher option is 0.94%. The probability drops significantly from single-turn to multi-turn conversations (0.94% 0.77%) when the model can see its own past answers, while Lower options rise (0.06% 0.22%), demonstrating the same less biased effect seen in our evaluation framework. Self-reported confidence score stay at 0.63 for both options, offering no signal about bias. This confirm that they fail to capture the outputs distribution and thus are unsuitable for bias detection. Meanwhile, the Higher option receives positive B-score (+0.17) and the Lower option negative one (-0.16), showing its effectiveness as bias indicator. In terms of verification task (Tab. T4), B-score substantially improves verification accuracy (Mean = 45.7). Moreover, B-score (89.6%) also performs significantly better than other metrics individually, such as Single-turn prob (20.9%), multi-turn prob (33.9%) and confidence scores (77.6%). C.3. How to choose number of samples for single-turn and multi-turn appropriately? Since B-score is computed by comparing the answer distributions between single-turn and multi-turn settings, it is natural to ask: how many samples (i.e., number of single-turn queries, number of turns in multi-turn conversations) are sufficient to obtain stable and reliable estimate? While increasing the number of samples generally improves robustness, it also incurs computational cost, especially when evaluating multiple LLMs or large benchmarks (i.e. CSQA, MMLU, HLE, BBQ). Therefore, we aim to determine whether smaller number of samples can still yield meaningful and consistent B-scores. 19 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history Table T4: Verification accuracy (%) on the BBQ bias benchmark. These results show that B-score is an effective standalone bias indicator, outperforming other metrics. Moreover, incorporating B-score substantially improves the performance of single-turn probabilities, multi-turn probabilities, and Confidence Scores in verification tasks (Overall = +45.7%)."

This suggests that reducing the number of samples does not significantly affect the reliability of B-score, and that using fewer queries can save substantial computation without compromising the quality of the signal. In our main experiments, we use = 30 to ensure high confidence and reproducibility. However, in practice, smaller values such as = 10 or = 20 may suffice, especially for resource-constrained settings. Recommendation As general guideline for using B-score, we recommend choosing to be approximately 23 times the number of answer options for given question. This ensures that each option can be observed multiple times under both single-turn and multi-turn settings. For example, in 10-choice question, = 20 or = 30 is ideal; for binary-choice questions, values as small as = 4 or = 6 may be sufficient. This strategy balances sample coverage with evaluation efficiency. C.4. LLMs can self-debias in multi-turn because they are capable To empirically explain why LLMs appear less biased in multi-turn conversations, we hypothesize that this behavior emerges not from new information introduced across turns, but rather from the models inherent capacity to track and self-adjust its responses over time. In this section, we validate this claim through targeted distributional experiments. Experiments We prompt GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to generate 100 samples from two well-known distributions: Uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution. Each sample is an integer in the range [0, 9]. The goal is to assess whether LLMs can reproduce expected statistical distributions through language-based generation alone, without direct access to random number generators by code. 20 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history"

These results reveal that LLMs can internalize and reproduce probabilistic patterns, even when specified in natural language. These results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of reproducing structured probabilistic patterns when prompted, even in the absence of any external randomness mechanism. These capabilities help explain why LLMs exhibit reduced bias in multi-turn conversations. The ability to reproduce structured distributions suggests that LLMs can internally track output patterns and modulate their future responses. In multi-turn settings, when the model sees its own previous answers, it can implicitly recognize imbalance (e.g. repeatedly 21 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history choosing one biased option) and adjust accordingly in subsequent turns. Importantly, this behavior does not require explicit instructions. It completely emerges from the models existing capabilities. 22 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history D. Examples What is the 50th decimal digit of pi?
