Corresponding author. 1 (LVLMs) have Large-scale Vision-Language Models rapidly evolved in recent years, effectively integrating visual perception with language understanding by leveraging large-scale multimodal data, which enables them to capture complex visual and textual patterns and drive significant advancements in image recognition, natural language processing, and multimodal tasks. With the advancement of multimodal integration technologies, the demand for highprecision processing of diverse data types in the medical field has become increasingly critical. The ability to effectively integrate and analyze various data modalities, such as medical images, clinical text, and structured clinical records, is pivotal for achieving accurate and comprehensive diagnostic and treatment decisions. However, existing LVLMs, such as GPT-4 [1], are limited in medical applications due to their lack of domainspecific knowledge, highlighting the need for specialized solutions that effectively integrate medical expertise. Addressing this challenge requires constructing comprehensive medical vision-language dataset and developing domain-specific models. For the medical dataset, it should provide high-quality medical knowledge, including the following three aspects: Comprehensive medical tasks. To enhance the models applicability across various medical scenarios, the dataset should cover wide range of medical contexts, such as disease types, symptoms, and treatments. Comprehensive task coverage can improve the models generalization ability and increase its reliability in real-world applications. However, existing models often focus on specific domains [28, 35, 41, 65, 72], limiting their broader applicability. Expanding the datasets scope will further enhance the models utility in clinical practice. Rich multimodal representation. well-rounded medical multimodal dataset should encompass various modalities, including different medical imaging types (such as CT, MRI, and X-rays) and diverse forms of textual data (such as medical records and imaging reports). This would allow models to better integrate multi-source information and improve their analytical capabilities. However, existing methods tend to focus on single type of medical imagery [33, 50, 70], limiting the models adaptability to diverse clinical scenarios. more diverse multimodal dataset would provide foundation for developing more comprehensive models, better suited to the complexity of realworld medical environments. High-quality image-text data. High-quality training data is essential for optimizing model performance, especially in medical applications. Ideally, image-text data for medical contexts should consist of large, well-curated collection of medical images paired with precise textual descriptions. This data would enhance the models understanding of key medical concepts, such as diagnosis, treatment, and clinical workflows, ultimately contributing to improved clinical outcomes. While progress has been made with datasets sourced from platforms like PubMed [39, 54, 70], these datasets suffer from inconsistent data quality, imprecise alignment between images and text, and lack of standardization, which limits their effectiveness. Based on above observations, we propose an annotationguided data generation methodology for developing comprehensive multimodal medical datasets. The methodology begins by collecting large-scale, open-source medical imaging datasets and extracting key annotations, such as modality, task type, labels, and bounding boxes. visionlanguage model (e.g., GPT-4o) is then used to transform these datasets, covering tasks like lesion detection, segmentation, and disease diagnosis, into high-quality image-text pairs for training LVLMs. To ensure data quality, extracted image information is incorporated into the prompt design, improving model performance across various clinical tasks. This results in comprehensive multimodal dataset with 5.5M samples, named GMAI-VL-5.5M, which supports the development of general medical LVLMs. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the sources, departments, modalities, task types, and instruction formats of the constructed dataset. With the constructed GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset, we develop general medical vision-language model, GMAI-VL. To enhance its integration of visual and linguistic features and its instruction-following abilities, three-stage training strategy is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we sequentially implement shallow and deep alignments in the first two stages, gradually building associations between visual (medical images) and language (medical texts) elements from basic features to high-level semantics. Next, we fine-tune the model with cross-modal instructions, improving its understanding of visual-language interactions and instruction-following in complex tasks. With this strategy, GMAI-VL shows strong performance in medical tasks like visual question answering and medical image diagnosis, providing solid foundation for advancing multimodal models in the medical field. The contributions of this work are as follows: We build an annotation-guided data generation methodology to construct GMAI-VL-5.5M, comprehensive vision-language dataset. This dataset offers extensive coverage of medical tasks, diverse multimodal representations, and high-quality image-text pairs, providing robust foundation for model training. Leveraging GMAI-VL-5.5M, we design GMAI-VL, versatile medical vision-language model. Our proposed three-stage training strategy enhances its ability to integrate visual and linguistic features, significantly improving its performance in instruction-following and generalization across wide range of medical tasks. GMAI-VL outperforms existing models in multimodal question-answering tasks, including PMC-VQA and VQA-RAD. It sets new benchmarks on OmniMedVQA, GMAI-MMBench, and Health & Medicine track of MMMU. Specifically, GMAI-VL achieves an average score of 88.48% on OmniMedVQA, 62.43% on the GMAI-MMBench test set, and 51.3% on the Health & Medicine track of MMMU. 2. Related Work Large-scale medical vision-language datasets of high quality and multiple modalities are the basis of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in the medical domain. While natural language and vision datasets are easily accessible online, biomedical datasets often focus on text or images only and many of them are limited to specific tasks or modalities, thus with unsatisfactory generalization ability. Notable datasets like MIMIC-CXR [33] and CheXpert [12] have advanced radiology models but are restricted to single image modality (X-ray), which hinders their use as generalpurpose medical LVLMs. To address this, researchers have begun scraping public sources like PubMed and textbooks to construct large-scale vision-language datasets. Examples include datasets proposed in LLaVA-Med [39], MedFlamingo [54], and PubMedVision [14], with PubMedVision optimizing LLaVA-Med dataset for higher-quality medical data. In addition to scraping, open-source image datasets with annotations can also be converted into imagetext pairs for model training. Specifically, image information like modalities and annotations are input into large language models, e.g., GPT series, to generate text paired with the corresponding image. Some popular examples in2 Figure 1. Overview of GMAI-VL and GMAI-VL-5.5M. (a) illustrates the sources, departments, modalities, task types, and instruction formats of the GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset.

These efforts usually suffer from either limited modalities, data sources, or task coverage. Thus, their dataset quality needs further improvement. To this end, we propose to construct comprehensive medical vision-language dataset with extensive coverage of medical tasks, diverse multimodal representations, and high-quality image-text pairs, forming robust foundation for model training. Medical vision-language models are usually based on general-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Most of them adapt LVLMs to specific medical applications using specialized medical datasets. For instance, MedFlamingo [54] enhances OpenFlamingo-9B using 0.8 million interleaved and 1.6 million paired medical image-text data, highlighting the critical need for multimodal data in medical image analysis and automated report generation tasks. RadFM [70] improves PMC-LLaMA [69] by leveraging 16 million radiology images with text descriptions from diverse sources. Similarly, Med-PaLM [68] adapts PaLM-E [25] to the medical domain with approximately one million medical data samples, achieving state-of-theart performance in diagnostic support and medical knowledge Q&A. LLaVA-Med [39] utilizes large-scale biomedical figure-caption dataset extracted from PubMed Central to enhance LLaVA [66, 67] to better understand biomedical images and facilitate open-ended conversational interactions. Med-Gemini [58] leverages long-format questionanswering datasets to improve the multimodal and longcontextual capabilities of the baseline Gemini model, enabling superior performance in complex medical Q&A and multimodal reasoning tasks. Additionally, HuatuoGPTVision [14] and MedDr [28] build medical multimodal datasets to adapt general-purpose LVLMs like LLaVA and InternVL to various medical modalities, including radiology, pathology, dermatology, and endoscopy. Previous studies usually focus on constructing medical datasets to adapt general-purpose LVLMs but pay less attention to the adaptation strategies. However, naive training/adaptation strategies may not successfully adapt general-purpose LVLMs to the medical data, due to the large gap between the natural image-text pairs and the medical ones. Moreover, these strategies can hardly align the broad imaging modalities and various types of medical text (e.g., prescriptions, radiology reports, and electronic health records) to obtain generalizable features, thus limiting the models performance. Our work thus proposes novel three-stage training strategy to better integrate the visual and language features to enhance generalization ability. 3 3. GMAI-VL-5.5M: Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset With rapid advancements in medical vision-language models (VLMs), constructing high-quality datasets is crucial for developing general-purpose models. Unlike previous approaches that primarily rely on published literature, our method utilizes specialized medical datasets to create more robust, high-quality resource. We build GMAI-VL5.5M, comprehensive medical vision-language dataset that aggregates data from diverse open-source and proprietary sources. Covering 13 medical imaging modalities and 18 specialties, it addresses wide range of medical imaging tasks. This dataset enhances the models ability to process complex medical information, advancing precision medicine and intelligent diagnostics. 3.1. Data Curation Data collection. To construct comprehensive multimodal medical dataset, we sourced 219 datasets from diverse platforms. Fig. 1(a) highlights key data sources, such as Kaggle, Grand Challenge, and Huggingface, which facilitate extensive data collection. These datasets cover diverse imaging modalities, including fundus, CT, MRI, and ultrasound (US), and span variety of medical tasks, such as diagnosis, severity assessment, and organ recognition. They also encompass multiple clinical specialties, including pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and oncology, further enhancing their diversity. Data preprocess. After data collection, we apply preprocessing workflow to extract 2D medical images from the videos and 3D medical volumes. For data cleaning, we first extract key annotation information from classification data, including modality, department, and labels for each image, discarding instances with missing or unclear annotations. For segmentation data, we follow the SAMed2D-20M [75] preprocessing method, filtering out lowquality images and labels, and converting them into detection datasets. The converted segmentation data is then processed together with the original detection dataset, with key annotation information extracted and linked to each image. Finally, the preprocessed data are then standardized and organized into structured format: <image, modality, label, department, bbox [optional]>. Data generation. Subsequently, the data are categorized into two primary types: classification datasets and detection/segmentation datasets. Each category is further refined using specific prompts tailored for large model training. For data generation, large vision-language models (GPT-4o) are employed to produce detailed image descriptions and corresponding instruction-following data through annotation-guided data generation methodology. For classification datasets, detailed descriptions of the entire imFigure 2. The prompt-driven data generation pipeline comparing without-annotation-guided and annotation-guided methods. The annotation-guided approach integrates specific annotation information (e.g., <image, modality, label, department, bbox [optional]>) to generate high-quality, accurate descriptions, while the without-annotationguided approach often results in lower-quality outputs. Figure with complete prompt and response is provided in Supp. Mat.. age are generated, while for detection datasets, the focus is on specific regions enclosed by bounding boxes, providing comprehensive functional analyses of these areas. Notably, the segmentation dataset was transformed into detection dataset using external bounding boxes, and data generation followed detection dataset protocols. Furthermore, to improve the models multilingual capability, we translated portion of English image-text data into Chinese. Incorporating multilingual data helps to enhance the generalization capabilities of domain-specific multimodal models. The resulted data is utilized for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, forming the comprehensive VQA dataset, named GMAI-VL-5.5M. The detailed pipeline for generating prompt-driven data is illustrated in Fig. 2. As depicted in Fig. 1(a), it contains six kinds of instrcuction-following formats, including image-level captions, region-level captions, free instructions, dialogue, visual perception and text-only tasks. The specific composition of GMAI-VL-5.5M can be found in Supp. Mat.  (Table 6)  . These formats enable VLMs to better understand and process complex visual and textual information in medical contexts. The GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset significantly en4 Table 1.

Data Property Data statistics. These datasets encompass diverse medical imaging tasks and modalities, forming solid foundation for developing and evaluating medical LVLMs. Fig. 4 (in Supp. Mat.) illustrates the distribution of modalities, tasks, clinical departments, and specific medical challenges represented within the collected datasets. This visualization highlights the extensive diversity and coverage of our data collection efforts. After careful standardization and integration, these datasets form the core of our comprehensive medical image-text dataset, GMAI-VL-5.5M, which serves as crucial resource for advancing precision medicine and intelligent diagnostic systems. Accuracy and reliability of generated data. The accuracy and reliability of the generated data are primarthe reliaily addressed from two key aspects. bility of the data source is ensured by utilizing highquality datasets from reputable sources. The data used for generation primarily comes from professional medical challenges (such as Kaggle and GrandChallenge) and publicly available, peer-reviewed datasets. This guarantees the integrity and accuracy of the data at its source. Second, the data generation process is rigorously controlled to ensure accuracy and reliability. Although GPT was used for data generation, prompts were meticulously crafted to include essential annotations, minimizing errors and hallucinations. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the proposed annotation-guided approach incorporates specific annotations (e.g., <image, modality, label, department, bbox [optional]>) to produce precise, high-quality descriptions. Compared to the withoutFirst, annotation-guided approach, which often results in less detailed outputs, the annotation-guided method delivers more professional, pathology-specific descriptions, significantly enhancing the reliability of the generated data. Compared with other medical multimodal datasets. The GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset, as highlighted in Table 1, stands out due to its unmatched scale, encompassing over 5.5 million samples from more than 219 specialized medical imaging datasets. Unlike other datasets listed, GMAIVL-5.5M supports wider variety of modalities and languages, making it truly global resource that caters to diverse clinical needs. Additionally, GMAI-VL-5.5M emphasizes traceability of its data, ensuring high standard of clinical relevance and reliability. This comprehensive and diverse dataset is critical for pushing the boundaries of medical multimodal research, enabling more effective training of LVLMs that can generalize across multiple medical tasks and scenarios, thereby driving innovations in precision medicine and intelligent diagnostics. 4.

            "content": "4.1. Architecture The GMAI-VL model is vision-language model built upon the LLaVA architecture [39, 45], incorporating three key components: large language model (LLM), vision encoder, and projector (MLP), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). These components are designed to work together seamlessly, enabling the model to deliver exceptional performance in medical applications. We adopt InternLM2.5-7B [63] as our language processing module, which offers outstanding reasoning capabilities. With context window up to one million tokens, it can handle complex medical tasks and generate coherent, accurate responses. Its support for advanced instructionfollowing makes it particularly effective in addressing intri5 cate medical queries, thereby enhancing the models ability to understand and respond to wide range of instructions. For vision processing, GMAI-VL employs CLIP-based vision encoder [55], which transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional feature representations. CLIPs strong performance in aligning image and text representations ensures that medical image features are accurately extracted and effectively integrated with linguistic information, significantly enhancing the models ability to handle multimodal medical data. The MLP, as projector, serves as bridge between the vision encoder and the LLM, optimizing high-dimensional outputs and further enhancing feature representation. The seamless integration of these components enables GMAIVL to excel in processing and understanding complex medical multimodal data. 4.2. Optimization Strategy As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the training process of the GMAIVL model is divided into three stages: shadow alignment, deep alignment, instruction tuning, respectively. The detailed hyper-parameter settings can be found in Supp. Mat.  (Table 8)  . To enhance the training of GMAI-VL, we supplement our GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset with additional medical datasets, ultimately forming an 11.7M dataset for training. This supplemented data increases the diversity of training data, exposing the model to wider range of medical scenarios and visual-language patterns, enhancing its generalization to complex clinical tasks and ensuring robustness in real-world applications. Fig. 5 (in Supp. Mat.) provides complete distribution of the utilized datasets during the training stage. The detailed data proportions for each training stage are detailed in Table 7 (in Supp. Mat.). Stage I: Shadow alignment. In the shallow alignment phase, we utilize large-scale medical image-text dataset comprising approximately 11.7 million image-text pairs, sourced from combination of publicly accessible datasets and proprietary in-house data. To achieve shallow alignment, we freeze both the large language model and the vision encoder, optimizing only the projector. With this optimization stage, the model establishes an initial alignment between medical images and their corresponding textual descriptions. All input images are resized to 336 336 pixels, and the training objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss of the text tokens. Stage II: Deep alignment. Most vision encoders in multimodal models are pre-trained on natural images, so it is essential to address the domain gap between medical and natural images during the deep alignment stage. To achieve this, we fine-tune both the vision-language projector and the vision encoder, enhancing the alignment between the visual features of medical images and the language models feature space. Stage III: Instruction tuning. At this stage, we fine-tune our GMAI-VL model (including the vision encoder, the language model, and the projector components) by instruction tuning to enhance its instruction-following and dialogue capabilities. The multimodal instruction tuning data is primarily derived from the training data in previous stages, with filtering process to select high-quality and more suitable data for fine-tuning. Specifically, we manually reviewed subset of each dataset and labeled it as either high quality or low quality. High-quality datasets were used for tuning, while most low-quality ones were excluded, except for small portion retained for diversity. This approach allowed efficient filtering without reviewing every sample. Additionally, we incorporate medical text dialogue data to ensure the models versatility in handling various dialogue scenarios. Thus, our instruction tuning data comprises approximately ten million samples. 5. Experimental Results To evaluate our model, we employed several established multimodal medical benchmarks, each targeting specific aspects of medical image understanding and question answering. Below is brief overview of the benchmarks used in our experiments: Traditional medical VQA benchmarks: Traditional multimodal medical question-answering benchmarks, such as VQA-RAD [38], SLAKE [44], and PMCVQA [80], span various imaging modalities tasks, primarily assessing the models ability to extract information from medical images and answer clinical questions. They evaluate the models performance in understanding medical imaging and integrating multimodal information. OmniMedVQA: OmniMedVQA [31] provides rich dataset of paired medical images and text, designed to evaluate the models ability to recognize and understand fundamental medical imaging concepts, focusing on cross-modal reasoning and information integration. GMAI-MMBench: GMAI-MMBench [16] focuses on assessing the models ability to identify fine-grained objects in complex clinical scenarios, challenging its capacity to handle long-context tasks and accurately recognize and reason over detailed medical features. MMMU Health & Medicine track: The Health & Medicine track of the MMMU [78] benchmark spans wide range of medical fields, derived from university exams, quizzes, and textbooks. It evaluates the models reasoning ability in complex medical scenarios and the specialized knowledge in health and medicine. 5.1.

Ablation Study on GMAI-VL-5.5M Dataset We further analyzed the effectiveness of the proposed GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset. By removing GMAI-VL-5.5M from the training set, we observed significant performance drop, as shown in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5. In the VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PMC-VQA benchmarks, removing GMAI-VL resulted in an average performance improvement of 8.6%. For the OmniMedVQA, GMAI-MMBench, and MMMU Health & Medicine track, the improvements were 8.52%, 6.75%, and 5.3%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the GMAI-VL5.5M dataset provides highly accurate and reliable medical knowledge, particularly in recognizing and understanding multimodal medical data, which significantly boosts model performance. This underscores the datasets diversity, comprehensiveness, and its ability to effectively complement other datasets in complex medical tasks. 6. Conclusion In this study, we develop GMAI-VL, large visionlanguage model, along with GMAI-VL-5.5M, comprehensive multimodal medical dataset aimed at advancing (GMAI). GMAI-VL-5.5M, which general medical AI image analysis datasets converts hundreds of medical into high-quality image-text pairs through annotationguided data generation, enables GMAI-VL to effectively address wide range of clinical Experimental results show that GMAI-VL-5.5M significantly enhances GMAI-VLs performance on diverse clinical tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across several key benchmarks. tasks."

            "content": "7. Expanded Data Generation Example In this section, we present the full version of Fig. 2, which provides detailed example of the data generation process, as shown in Fig.3. This expanded illustration includes the complete prompt and the corresponding detailed responses, enabling clear comparison between data generation methodologies with and without annotation guidance. The detailed comparison allows for more intuitive understanding of the distinctions between both methods. 8. Details of GMAI-VL-5.5M In Table. 6, we provide sub-datasets information of the multimodal dataset GMAI-VL-5.5M we have constructed. Based on the different data forms introduced in the paper, we have categorized the data into five distinct sub-datasets. These include GMAI-MM-Caption-1.7M, GMAI-MM-Percept-1.3M, GMAI-MM-Instruct-0.9M, and GMAI-Text-0.6M. Each GMAI-Text-Single-1M, image sub-dataset corresponds to specific components: caption data, free instruction data, visual perception data, text-only, and conversation. Furthermore, Fig. 4 presents comprehensive distribution of the data across different modalities, original tasks, departments, and clinical task within this multimodal dataset, highlighting its extensive richness and diversity. 9. Training Data Overview In this section, we provide comprehensive overview of all datasets utilized for training the GMAI-VL model. The details include the dataset names, their corresponding categories, the amount of data used for training, and the proportion of training data allocated to each dataset during the three phases of model training. Fig. 5 visualizes the distribution of all our training data, showing the proportion of each category and subcategory. Table. 7 summarizes the datasets employed, highlighting their respective categories and sizes. It is important to note that for certain datasets, we performed data cleaning and bilingual translation. As result, the dataset sizes reported here may differ from the official numbers. 10. Model Training Settings The table. 8 presents the training settings for GMAI-VL across three stages, detailing key hyperparameters. The train diagram as illustrated in Fig. 6. Stage (Shallow alignment). During this stage, both the large language model (LLM) and the vision encoder are frozen, while the MLP remains trainable. The learning rate is set to 1e3 with cosine decay schedule, using AdamW as the optimizer. Input size is 336 336, and the total batch size is 32 8 2. Here, 32 refers to the number of GPUs used, 8 represents the micro-batch size per GPU, and 2 is the number of gradient accumulation steps. Notably, we use soft packing technique, which allows each sample to actually contain multiple sequencesestimated at over 2 per sample. Stage II (Deep alignment). The LLM remains frozen, while the vision encoder and MLP are unfrozen and trainable, allowing for deeper feature alignment. The learning rate is lowered to 1e4, the total batch size is 32 4 4, and other settings remain consistent with Stage I. Stage III (Instruction tuning). In this stage, all components of the model are trainable, allowing for comprehensive fine-tuning. The learning rate is further reduced to 1e5, the total batch size is 32 4 4, while other parameters, including optimizer, remain unchanged across stages. Each stage utilizes DeepSpeed for mixed-precision training (bf16) on 32 A100 (80GB) GPUs. To accelerate the training rate of the model, we utilize the soft packing method in xtuner*, which packs multiple sequences into each sample to optimize memory usage and efficiency.. 11. Results Fig. 7 illustrates several examples of our model on various tasks including image description, disease diagnosis, diagnostic report generation, free question answering, etc. These examples cover diverse range of medical imaging modalities and tasks, highlighting the models versatility and general capabilities within medical domain. Furthermore, GMAI-VL supports both Chinese and English, thereby facilitating bilingual functionality and expanding its applicability in diverse clinical settings. *https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner 1 Figure 3. The full version of Fig. 2 in the main text illustrates the complete of data generation pipeline comparing without-annotationguided and annotation-guided methods. The annotation-guided approach integrates specific annotation information (e.g., <image, modality, label, department, bbox [optional]>) to generate high-quality, accurate descriptions, while the withoutannotation-guided approach often results in lower-quality outputs."
