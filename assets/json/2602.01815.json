Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across wide variety of tasks (Singh et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2024; Team et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Beyond direct prompting, recent works have introduced AI agents capable of planning and executing actions over multiple iterations (Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; M. Bran et al., 2024). While impressive, singleagent systems often encounter constraints such as bounded context windows and limited perspective diversity. To address this, multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful 1Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea 2Yonsei university, South Korea. Correspondence to: Sungsoo Ahn <sungsoo.ahn@kaist.ac.kr>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 paradigm for automated discovery (Du et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2024). By leveraging collaborative intelligence, these systems effectively simulate the real-world research process with growing applications in scientific discovery (Lu et al., 2024; Du et al., 2025; Gottweis et al., 2025) and molecular discovery (Kim et al., 2025). To differentiate the conversational behavior of each agent, prior works typically assign distinct personas through roleplay prompting (Kong et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Park et al., 2023; Piao et al., 2025), e.g., planner, verifier, or reviewer, or through keywords (Su et al., 2025). While this role-based or keyword-based separation effectively shapes output style, it often oversimplifies the rich reality of how human scientists operate. In practice, scientists individuality is defined not merely by coarse-grained generic role or set of keywords, but by their unique fine-grained research trajectory, distinctive scientific DNA composed of cumulative experiences and domain-specific intuitions. By ignoring this, current systems fail to leverage the deep, nuanced insights characteristic of real-world collaboration. The existence of such scientific DNA is particularly well established in the domain of drug discovery. Chemists exhibit distinctive styles for designing new molecules, such as preferences for particular scaffolds, functional groups, and reaction motifs (Pedreira et al., 2019; Choung et al., 2023), based on their own research trajectory. Recently, Blevins & Quigley (2025) quantified this phenomenon, demonstrating that models can identify which of 1,815 chemists synthesized molecule with 60% top-5 accuracy from structure alone. While they frame this as Clever Hans (Lapuschkin et al., 2019) leakage problem that distorts benchmark evaluations, we reinterpret it as blueprint for agent design. We argue that these styles encode heuristics for effectively navigating chemical space and representing the expertise diversity that mimics real-world collaboration. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, multi-agent framework for molecular discovery that bridges the gap between generic coarse-grained personas and chemical reality by grounding agents in individual research trajectories, as illustrated in Figure 1. Instead of relying on heuristically predefined roles or keywords, INDIBATOR constructs agent profiles utilizing two informative sources that encode reINDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery Figure 1. Overview of INDIBATOR. Given task, the supervisor agent selects relevant scientists by identifying the authors of publications by RAG. Next, individuality is grounded for each agent with scientist profiles, consisting of publication history and molecular history of each scientist. Finally, multi-agents debate to iteratively generate candidate molecules with proposal, critique, and voting phases. search trajectory: (1) publication history, collection of publications that define the agents literature-derived knowledge and methodological preferences, and (2) molecular history, set of previously developed molecules that establishes structural priors, such as preferred scaffolds and functional groups. This data-driven profile provides unique individuality to each agent, effectively mirroring the real-world scientific process where discovery emerges from researchers unique cumulative knowledge and inductive biases. This individuality-driven design provides two key benefits: (1) diversity, where unique agent profiles prevent redundant reasoning among the agents; and (2) fact-grounding, where explicit reliance on publication and molecular records empowers reasoning grounded in verifiable evidence. To demonstrate the effect of our fine-grained individuality, we implement multi-agent debating system consisting of three iterative phases: (1) proposal, (2) critique, and (3) voting. During these phases, each agent proposes molecular candidates, critiques proposals, and assigns scores based on their specific expertise, mirroring the collective intelligence of real-world scientist teams. We empirically evaluate INDIBATOR across three downstream tasks: protein-conditioned molecule generation, bioactivity-guided molecule generation, and goal-directed lead optimization. Our results show that INDIBATOR consistently outperforms vanilla debating systems and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks. Moreover, we provide comprehensive analyses demonstrating the impact of individuality, which validates that capturing the nuanced scientific DNA is fundamental driver of molecular design. While the principle of expertisegrounded individuality may generalize to other scientific domains, our results demonstrate that it is critical component for enhancing molecular discovery, where scientist style provides concrete empirical grounding. 2. INDIBATOR The INDIBATOR framework instantiates collective of scientist agents grounded in their own unique research trajectories. Unlike conventional multi-agent systems (Kong et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Park et al., 2023), our approach ensures more fine-grained individuality of each agent with research trajectory profiles. Specifically, we condition each agent on distinct real-world profile derived from their prior publications and historical molecular discoveries. This provides two key benefits: Diversity: Each agents system prompt is uniquely constructed based on their expertise, preventing redundant reasoning across the multi-agent ensemble. Fact-grounding: Each agents reasoning is grounded in real-world profiles, ensuring that their arguments are supported by concrete empirical evidence, including papers and discovered molecules. 2.1. Individuality-grounded Profile Construction To ensure the individuality of each scientist agent, we construct expertise profiles from two modalities: (1) publication history: collection of publications retrieved from PubMed (Luna, 2024; Cho, 2024) that define the agents literature-derived knowledge, including their research focus and methodological preferences; and (2) molecular history: set of molecules previously developed by the scientist that establishes structural priors, represented as SMILES 2 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery strings (Weininger, 1988). Notably, the inclusion of molecular history Mi is motivated by the Clever Hans phenomenon in chemistry (Blevins & Quigley, 2025), which highlights correlation between molecular structures and the scientists associated with their discovery. In detail, given research objective or task description , supervisor agent employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG; Lewis et al., 2020) over vector space of literature in PubMed to identify the most relevant research papers. The supervisor then extracts the first and last authors to represent the primary researchers and principal investigators, respectively. These identified scientists construct set of scientist agents, = {s1, s2, . . . , sN }, where is hyperparameter that defines the number of scientists. Finally, each scientist agent si is initialized with an expertise profile Ei = {Pi, Mi}, where Pi denotes their publication history, including the titles and abstracts, and Mi denotes the molecular history, i.e., set of molecules discovered by the scientist. Specifically, subset of publications is selected based on the frequency of task-relevant keywords, while molecules are retrieved based on their structural similarity to provided seed molecule if available. 2.2. Multi-agent Debating System The proposed debating system consists of three phases: proposal, critique, and voting. This iterative process continues until reaching maximum round limit or accumulating sufficient number of candidates. We provide detailed qualitative case study of diversified and fact-grounded debating process in Figure 3 and detailed prompts in Appendix A. Proposal. During the proposal phase, each scientist agent, i.e., an agent conditioned with individual scientist profiles, generates molecular candidates grounded in their specific expertise. Each agent is provided with prompt including their expertise profile Ei and the task description . Scientists propose candidates, accompanied by rationales that link each proposal to their prior knowledge. In subsequent rounds, agents also receive candidates and critiques from previous iterations to facilitate refinement. Critique. The critique phase operates in two stages to generate feedback for candidate molecules. First, in an optional self-critique stage, scientist agents invoke tools to evaluate their own proposals, identifying weaknesses and modifying their designs. Next, agents engage in cross-critique stage, where they evaluate peer proposals to simulate collaborative review process similar to the real-world scientific discovery. In this step, agents leverage their own personas to suggest domain-specific modifications, thereby ensuring that final candidates are robust across multiple criteria. Voting. In the voting phase, scientists assess the candidates, incorporating the insights from the critique phase. Each scientist agent si evaluates the candidate pool, assigning scalar score [0, 1] based on three objectives: task relevance, synthetic feasibility, and novelty. Based on these scores, each agent casts votes for the top candidates. These votes are subsequently aggregated to determine the global ranking. The highest-ranked candidates either proceed to the subsequent round or are selected as the final candidates. 3. Downstream Task Evaluation Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed INDIBATOR, on three molecular downstream tasks: (1) protein-conditioned molecule generation (Section 3.1), (2) bioactivity-guided molecule generation (Section 3.2), and (3) goal-directed lead optimization (Section 3.3). Notably, we utilize the Deepseek-V3.2 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) backbone. We provide task prompts in Appendix and further experimental settings in Appendix B. 3.1. Protein-conditioned Molecule Generation Task description. The goal of the protein-conditioned molecule generation task is to generate molecules with high binding affinity to the target protein. In detail, we select eight target proteins: TYK2, JNK1, CDK2, P38, CA2, THROMBIN, FABP4, and DHFR. The first four proteins are selected following the binding affinity prediction task of Boltz-2 (Passaro et al., 2025). Since these targets are all kinases, to expand the scope of evaluation, we expanded the evaluation scope to include non-kinase targets: CA2 (metalloenzyme), THROMBIN (serine protease), FABP4 (lipidbinding protein), and DHFR (oxidoreductase). This ensures diverse coverage of protein domains and ligand interaction mechanisms. We generate 1,000 candidate molecules for each protein. We employ two types of metrics: binding affinity and diversity. First, for the binding affinity, we utilize Boltz-2 (Passaro et al., 2025) as our proxy. Specifically, we employ affinity pred value, which quantifies the specific affinity of various binders and tracks how these values change in response to small molecular modifications. For standardized comparison, we convert the binding affinity value, represented as log10(IC50), into kcal/mol. Our final evaluation metrics consist of (1) the Top-1 binding affinity and (2) the mean of the Top-10 binding affinities achieved by the 1,000 generated candidates. In addition, we provide two metrics to validate whether individuality matters for the diversity of generations. In detail, the diversity is computed with (3) internal diversity (IntDiv; Polykovskiy et al., 2020) and (4) the number of cir3 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery (a) Binding affinity (b) Diversity Figure 2.

Method denoted with an asterisk (*) indicated LLM-based baselines implemented by the authors to ensure consistent experimental settings. Baselines. We establish VANILLADEBATE and KEYWORDDEBATE as our baselines. Both baselines follow the identical debating framework of our INDIBATOR. However, VANILLADEBATE operates without any profile, while KEYWORDDEBATE constructs the profile with research keywords extracted from the publication history of each agent, inspired by VirSci (Su et al., 2025). Structure LLM Results. We provide the results in Figure 2 and detailed values in Appendix C. INDIBATOR consistently beats the baselines across all target proteins and metrics, demonstrating superior performance in both binding affinity and molecular diversity. Importantly, while the baselines frequently suffer from mode collapse, indicated by their lower diversity, INDIBATOR successfully navigates the chemical space to generate high volume of structurally distinct clusters without compromising optimization quality. Notably, the KEYWORDDEBATE demonstrates negligible improvement compared to the VANILLA baseline, highlighting that coarse-grained keywords are insufficient for the nuanced reasoning needed for molecular design. Our superior performance across diverse protein families validates that our fine-grained profile-grounded agents can effectively adapt their search strategy to distinct biological interactions. 3.2.

Following prior works (Kim et al., 2025; Nguyen & Grover, 2025), we conduct experiments on the practical molecular optimization (PMO)-1K benchmark (Gao et al., 2022), which computes the score among 1,000 generated molecules. Notably, we excluded other tasks in PMO, such as rediscovery of given molecule or isomer generation that satisfies the molecular formula. These tasks represent arithmetic structural puzzles where success depends on precise reconstruction instead of broad exploration of diverse molecules. For the metric, we report average of top-10 AUC scores, the area under the curve (AUC) of the top-10 average performance versus oracle calls.

We benchmark against eleven baselines, categorized into five structure-based and six LLM-based approaches. The structure-based approaches includes GP BO (Srinivas et al., 2010), REINVENT (Olivecrona et al., 2017), Genetic GFN (Kim et al., 2024), Graph GA (Jensen, 2019), and Augmented Memory (Guo & Schwaller, 2024). Additionally, we compare against LLMbased approaches, including LICO (Nguyen & Grover, 2025), MOLLEO (Wang et al., 2025), the role-based multiagent system MT-Mol (Kim et al., 2025), VANILLA, VANILLADEBATE, and KEYWORDDEBATE inspired by VirSci (Su et al., 2025). Here, VANILLA indicates the LLM prompting approach without any debate. Notably, MT-Mol is critical baseline for evaluating the performance of multi-agent system with generic role-based assignment. Results. We report the results in Table 1. We observe that INDIBATOR consistently enhances the performance across all tasks. It is notable that our method demonstrates substantial performance margin over the role-based MT-Mol and KEYWORDDEBATE. This validates that finegrained, diverse, and fact-grounded individuality provides more effective inductive bias for chemical space navigation than generic role prompts or keywords. Furthermore, INDIBATOR outperforms optimization baselines such as Genetic GFN by significant margins, ranging from 17.4% (DRD2) to 123.5% (JNK3) across the evaluated targets. 3.3. Goal-directed Lead Optimization Task description. The goal of the goal-directed lead optimization task is to generate leads given an initial seed molecule. The leads are the molecules that exhibit improved target properties while maintaining the similarity with the given seed molecule. Following Lee et al. (2025), the objective is to maximize the binding affinity measured by the docking score while satisfying the following constraints: QED 0.6, SA 4, and sim 0.6. The similarity is defined as the Tanimoto similarity between the Morgan fingerprints of the generated and seed molecules. We adopt five target proteins: parp1, fa7, 5ht1b, braf, and jak2, and each protein includes three different seed molecules. We evaluate performance based on the docking score of the most optimized lead. Baselines. We compare against five baselines categorized into two paradigms. The first category comprises learningbased optimization methods: Graph GA (Jensen, 2019), RetMol (Wang et al., 2023), and GenMol (Lee et al., 2025). Crucially, these models are explicitly trained with feedback loops to satisfy constraints and maximize docking scores, establishing strong performance standard. In contrast, INDIBATOR operates without any task-specific finetuning. Following this, the second category consists of inference-only LLM baselines, VANILLA and VANILLADEBATE, which follow the settings in the previous experiments. Results. We provide the results in Table 2. While the VANILLA baseline fails to generate single qualified molecule that satisfies all the constraints, debate showed improvement. However, while VANILLADEBATE shows improvement, INDIBATOR consistently generates more optimized leads, demonstrating that our expertise-grounded profiles provide the appropriate guidance to navigate constrained chemical space. While INDIBATOR does not uniformly surpass state-of-the-art baselines and shows only competitive results, this is expected as the baselines are trained to maximize target properties while our method operates solely on inference-time and does not include any task-specific training required by the baselines. 4. Analysis In this section, we conduct comprehensive analysis to dissect the mechanisms behind INDIBATORs performance utilizing the bioactivity-guided molecule generation task. We begin by presenting qualitative results in Section 4.1, illustrating how agents leverage their unique research trajectories for reasoning. Next, we investigate the impact of individuality by addressing three key research questions: Granularity (Section 4.2): Does the granularity of the profile impact the performance? Diversity (Section 4.3): Does the performance stem from the heterogeneity of expert perspectives? Fact-Grounding (Section 4.4): Is grounding agents in real-world data essential compared to synthetic or hallucinated profiles? 5 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery Figure 3. Qualitative case study on individuality grounded agents. We provide qualitative analysis of the JNK3 inhibition guided molecule generation task. Specifically, we show how an agent leverages prior publications and molecules to propose candidate, while other agents utilize their profiles to offer targeted critiques. Finally, we provide an ablation study in Section 4.5 to evaluate the impact of the number of scientists and each component in INDIBATOR. identifies the sulfonamide motif as blood-brain barrier (BBB) liability due to its high polarity. It suggests replacing the sulfonamide with the chloro or cyano groups, which reduces the polar surface area (Kelder et al., 1999). 4.1. Qualitative Case Study We illustrate how grounding agents in distinct publication and molecular histories shapes their reasoning during the JNK3 inhibition guided molecule generation task in Figure 3. This shows that grounding agents in their individual scientific profiles leads to distinct, chemically plausible reasoning trajectories. It is notable that we present partial examples for simplicity, while all agents engage in the debate in parallel for the entire proposal, critique, and voting phases. We provide more detailed examples in Appendix C. The first agent, retrieving its prior publication on 3D quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) on JNK1 inhibitors (Yi & Qiu, 2008), proposes candidate molecule with an aminopyridine carboxamide scaffold. This is scientifically sound considering the high structural homology between the JNK1 and JNK3 ATP-binding pockets, transferring the pharmacophore is logical exploitation (Liu et al., 2006). This proposal triggers structural critique from second agent, which proposes to refine the scaffold driven by its background on indolin-2-one Aurora inhibitors (Zhang et al., 2015). To be specific, this critique is to replace the core scaffold, which explores novel binding modes with an indole core (Chen et al., 2016). Finally, the third agent critiques to refine the molecule for the specific therapeutic indication. Grounded in central nervous system (CNS) focused publication (Zheng et al., 2014), the agent correctly 4.2. Effect of Granularity Here, we analyze the effect of granularity, which refers to the depth and specificity of information used to construct an agents persona, ranging from generic role assignments to detailed research trajectory-based profiles. To analyze this, we consider three baselines representing the spectrum of granularity: VANILLADEBATE, role persona, and keyword persona. In detail, role persona represents coarse-grained individuality, where agents are assigned based on generic, LLM-generated task-related roles (e.g., medicinal chemist, cheminformatics scientist, etc.). Next, the keyword persona represents mid-level granularity where agents are defined by keywords extracted from the publication history of each agent, inspired by VirSci (Su et al., 2025). Finally, INDIBATOR represents our fine-grained individuality based on publication and molecular histories. The results in Table 3 demonstrate that increasing profile granularity consistently improves the performance. While role persona and keyword persona offer marginal gains over the VANILLADEBATE, INDIBATOR, which utilizes the full publication and molecular history, significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of both performance and diversity. This confirms that capturing the nuanced scientific DNA rather than just generic roles or keywords is critical for 6 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery Table 3. Comprehensive quantitative analysis. We evaluate models across three perspectives: Granularity (level of detail in profile), Diversity (heterogeneity of agents), and Fact-grounding (relevance and truthfulness of knowledge). , , and indicates the low-, mid-, and high-level of each property, respectively.

Effect of Diverse Agents Here, we analyze the effect of diversity to observe whether the collaborative performance stems merely from the aggregation of knowledge or from the interaction between diverse and heterogeneous expert perspectives. We consider three baselines: VANILLADEBATE, singleprofile, and massive single-profile. By assigning identical (or null) profiles across all agents in baselines, we can explicitly observe the impact of diversity. In detail, single-profile forces multiple agents to share an identical profile (nondiverse profile), where the profile is selected as the most relevant for the scientists. Next, in massive single-profile, every agent is assigned an identical and comprehensive profile constructed from the union of scientist profiles in INDIBATOR. Due to context window constraints, this union aggregates 50% of the selected profiles. The results in Table 3 highlight the necessity of collaboration between diverse agents. Single-profile performs even worse than the VANILLADEBATE in most metrics, suggesting that enforcing narrow and homogeneous perspective hinders exploration. Crucially, INDIBATOR outperforms the massive single-profile, proving that performance gains stem not merely from the volume of knowledge, but from the diversity of perspectives that enables agents to cross-examine and propose diverse candidates. 4.4. Effect of Fact-grounding Agents To analyze the importance of grounding agents in factual data, we consider three baselines: VANILLADEBATE, LLMgenerated profile, and random-profile. In this experiment, we ensure that every agent possesses unique profile to decouple the benefits of fact-grounding from those of diversity. In detail, the agents in LLM-generated profiles are initialized with synthetic publication and molecular histories generated by LLMs given scientist name. Although these profiles possess the same structure of real profiles, they cannot guarantee the factual accuracy due to the potential hallucinations. The random-profile assigns agents complete and factual but task-irrelevant profiles. The results in Table 3 indicate that fact-grounding is significant. Specifically, the LLM-generated profile performs poorly, often inferior to the random-profile baseline. This suggests that hallucinated expertise introduces noise that degrades reasoning more than irrelevant but real expertise. INDIBATOR, which grounds agents in actual publication and molecular history, achieves superior performance across all benchmarks. This shows that our profiles provide true inductive biases grounded in established knowledge, effectively guiding exploration toward biologically plausible regions. 4.5. Ablation Study The number of scientists. To analyze the impact of the number of scientists who engage in the debate, we evaluate the performance of INDIBATOR and VANILLADEBATE while varying the number of scientist agents (N ) from 5 to 50 on the JNK3 inhibition guided molecule generation task. We provide the results in Figure 4. The results demonstrate that increasing the number of scientists (N ) enhances the performance in INDIBATOR while the VANILLADEBATE exhibits performance degradation due to the reduced number of rounds. Specifically, as the number of scientists increases, the debate concludes in single round for both models. For INDIBATOR, this is sufficient as the diverse agents generate high-quality initial proposals that cover the chemical space effectively. In contrast, the VANILLADEBATE relies on iterative debate process. This highlights that individuality enables more efficient scaling law, where expanding the diversity of perspectives can 7 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery Table 4.

This enhances individuality, promoting both diverse and fact-grounded collaboration among agents. LLM in molecular discovery. Recent advancements have increasingly adapted LLMs for molecular discovery. Approaches like LICO (Nguyen & Grover, 2025) and MOLLEO (Wang et al., 2025) extend LLMs with structured embeddings or evolutionary search to enable molecule generation. To address the complex reasoning in the molecular domain, few works have evolved into agent systems. For instance, ChemCrow (M. Bran et al., 2024), single-agent system that combines general-purpose LLMs with chemistry tools and ReAct-based reasoning loop, and MT-Mol (Kim et al., 2025), multi-agent system that operates tool-guided reasoning and role-specialized LLM agents. However, critical limitation of these frameworks comes from their reliance on single-agent architectures or coarsegrained role-based personas, rather than grounded individual expertise. Existing agents lack the rich context of scientists research trajectory, such as the prior publications and previously discovered molecules that define their unique inductive bias. INDIBATOR addresses this by explicitly grounding each agent in comprehensive profile of their actual research trajectory, effectively replacing generic roleplay with collaboration driven by distinct scientific DNA. 6. Conclusion We presented INDIBATOR, multi-agent framework that improves upon coarse-grained generic role-playing by grounding scientist agents in their unique research trajectories. By constructing individual profiles from publication and molecular history for each agent, the system initiates agents with distinct scientific DNA that guides their knowledgegrounded reasoning. Our evaluation across diverse molecular discovery tasks demonstrates that this individualitybased approach consistently outperforms vanilla debating systems and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to other baselines. Furthermore, we empirically validated the three-fold benefits of our framework, i.e., granularity, diversity, and fact-grounding, confirming that capturing the nuanced inductive biases of individual researchers is critical component for high-quality scientific discovery. We believe that our framework establishes foundation for incorporating broader modalities, such as conversation records, further enhancing the fidelity of agents in domain-specific environments. Figure 4. Effect of the number of collaborators. Annotated numbers above and below each data point indicate the number of debate rounds required to generate 1,000 candidates. effectively substitute for the iterative debate. Effect of each component. To evaluate the individual contributions of each phase within our framework, we conduct an ablation study by removing the critique and voting phases, and individuality (VANILLADEBATE). We evaluate the performance on all three bioactivities. As result, as shown in Table 4, we observe performance improvement as each component is integrated. Notably, the most critical increment occurs with the individuality, identifying it as the dominant factor contributing to INDIBATORs success. 5. Related Work LLM-based multi-agent systems. The AI agents have evolved rapidly from single-agent frameworks (Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023) to multi-agent systems (MAS) that leverage collaborative intelligence (Du et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Mitchener et al., 2025). By assigning distinct personas to LLMs, MAS can simulate complex interactions, effectively leveraging each agents capabilities and expertise. Standard approaches typically employ role-play prompting (Kong et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Park et al., 2023; Piao et al., 2025) to instantiate generic personas by prompting (e.g., You are an expert in biology.). However, this coarse-grained role-based agent scales poorly to massive multi-agent scenarios, where defining sufficient number of distinct and specialized roles becomes intractable. Recent works have attempted to mitigate this by introducing more fine-grained personas, such as keywords. For instance, VirSci (Su et al., 2025) constructs scientist agents using keywords based on publications and collaboration networks, demonstrating effective multi-agent collaboration for paper abstract generation. However, keywords alone lack the granular expertise required for real-world scientific debate. Moreover, in the molecular discovery domain, literaturederived knowledge is insufficient as chemists exhibit distinctive structural priors such as scaffolds and functional groups, which are not fully captured by publication texts alone. To address this, INDIBATOR incorporates both pubINDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery"

This work uses publicly available academic records, including titles, abstracts, and molecular discoveries from PubMed, to construct expertise profiles for large language model (LLM) agents. The proposal, critiques, and voting generated by these agents are outcomes of the LLMs probabilistic generation and do not represent the actual opinions, unpublished insights, or endorsement of the real-world scientists cited. Resemblance to the actual private reasoning of individuals is result of the models grounding in their public work. The use of specific scientist profiles in this study is strictly for the purpose of validating the efficacy of individuality grounding in molecular discovery. Additionally, our system could be misused for unethical purposes, such as automating the creation of toxic or harmful molecules. To mitigate these risks, future work should explore safeguards and establish ethical guidelines. Anthropic. Introducing claude 4, 2024. URL https: //www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4. 1 Blevins, A.

The genetic algorithm of GOLD3.1 has been employed to position 54 aminopyridine carboxamides in the active sites of JNK-1 to determine the probable binding conformation. The docking results provided reliable conformational alignment scheme for 3D-QSAR model. Based on the docking conformations, highly predictive comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was performed with cross-validated q(2) of 0.585. The non-cross-validated analysis with six optimum components revealed conventional r(2) value of 0.988, F=510.200, and an estimated standard error of 0.071. Furthermore, the CoMFA model was mapped back to the binding sites of JNK-1, to get better understanding of vital interactions between the aminopyridine carboxamides and the kinase. Based on the docking and CoMFA analyses, we have identified some key features in the aminopyridine carboxamides that are responsible for JNK-1 inhibitory activity. The analyses may be used to design more potent aminopyridine carboxamides and predict their activity prior to synthesis. }, { title: Integrating Metabolomics and Proteomics Technologies Provides Insights into the Flavor Precursor Changes at Different Maturity Stages of Arabica Coffee Cherries., abstract: The metabolic modulation of major flavor precursors during coffee cherry ripening is critical for the characteristic coffee flavor formation. However, the formation mechanism of flavor precursors during coffee cherry ripening remains unknown. In the present study, colorimeter was employed to distinguish different maturity stages of coffee cherry based on the coffee cherry skin colors, and proteomics and metabolomics profiles were integrated to comprehensively investigate the flavor precursor dynamics involved in Arabica coffee cherry ripening. The data obtained in the present study provide an integral view of the critical pathways involved in flavor precursor changes during coffee cherry ripening. Moreover, the contributions of critical events in regulating the development of flavor precursors during the four ripening stages of coffee cherries, including the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways of organic acids, amino acids, flavonoids, and sugars, are discussed. Overall, total of 456 difference express metabolites were selected, and they were identified as being concentrated in the four maturity stages of coffee cherries; furthermore, 76 crucial enzymes from the biosynthesis and metabolism of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and flavonoids contributed to flavor precursor formation. Among these enzymes, 45 difference express proteins that could regulate 40 primary amino acids and organic acids flavor precursors were confirmed. This confirmation indicates that the metabolic pathways of amino acids and organic acids played significant role in the flavor formation of Arabica coffee cherries during ripening. These results provide new insights into the protease modulation of flavor precursor changes in Arabica coffee cherry ripening. }, detailed example of molecule history. { smiles: O=C1NC(=O)c2c1c(-c1ccccc1Cl)cc1oc3ccc(O)cc3c21, inchi key: KGAPFKLOTLAAMY-UHFFFAOYSA-N, title: 3D-QSAR studies of Checkpoint Kinase Weel inhibitors based on molecular docking, CoMFA and 21 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery CoMSIA., pubmed id: 17698256 }, { smiles: CCn1c2ccc(O)cc2c2c3c(c(-c4ccccc4Cl)cc21)C(=O)NC3=O, inchi key: PPKWYAYCBJKWOR-UHFFFAOYSA-N, title: 3D-QSAR studies of Checkpoint Kinase Weel inhibitors based on molecular docking, CoMFA and CoMSIA., pubmed id: 17698256 } detailed example of proposal phase. { SMILES: CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(N)c(C#N)c(NC3CCCC3)n2)cc1, rationale: This molecule is designed based on structural insights from my paper 3D-QSAR and docking studies of aminopyridine carboxamide inhibitors of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1. The core scaffold features an aminopyridine carboxamide, which is known pharmacophore for JNK inhibition. The sulfonamide group (CS(=O)(=O)) at the para position of the phenyl ring, as seen in several active compounds from that study, is crucial for binding affinity and selectivity. The cyano group (C#N) adjacent to the pyridine nitrogen enhances electron-withdrawing properties, potentially improving kinase hinge region interaction. The cycloalkylamine substituent (NC3CCCC3) on the pyridine ring is introduced to modulate lipophilicity and metabolic stability, aiming for favorable ADMET properties. This design integrates key features from successful JNK1 inhibitors, adapted here for JNK3, which shares high structural homology in the ATP-binding site. }, { SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(N)c(C#N)c(NC3CC3)n2)cc1, rationale: An acetamide group (CC(=O)N) replaces the sulfonamide, exploring alternative hydrogen bond acceptor/donor profiles for JNK3 binding, based on the versatility of amides in kinase inhibitors noted in my QSAR studies. The core cyanoaminopyridine with cyclopropylamine is maintained. The acetyl group may be metabolically labile, offering potential prodrug effect. This design diversifies from the typical sulfonamide, aiming to discover new interactions while retaining the essential pharmacophore. It reflects the structural variation seen in my work on different triterpene classes, such as cycloartanes versus serratanes, where subtle changes led to distinct biological activities. } detailed example of critique phase. { SMILES: CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(N)c(C#N)c(NC3CCCC3)n2)cc1, proposer: XXX XXX, critique: Cyclopentylamine is good hydrophobic group. The sulfonamide remains concern for metabolism. The molecule is similar to others proposed; consider varying the core scaffold to explore different binding modes, perhaps by incorporating heterocyclic hinge binder like an indole or purine. }, { SMILES: CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(N)c(C#N)c(NC3CCCC3)n2)cc1, proposer: XXX XXX, critique: The cyclobutyl group (CCCC3) is constrained aliphatic ring, which might improve potency by reducing flexibility. However, the hinge-binding motif is still not optimal. From my research (Papers 1, 6), kinase inhibitors benefit from specific heterocyclic cores. } 22 INDIBATOR : Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery detailed example of voting phase. { SMILES: CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(N)c(C#N)c(NC3CCCC3)n2)cc1, score: 0.9, justification: Based on my 3D-QSAR studies of aminopyridine carboxamide JNK1 inhibitors (Paper 2), this scaffold shows high predicted JNK3 affinity. The sulfonylphenyl linker and cyanoaminopyridine core are key for kinase binding. The cyclobutylamide tail enhances selectivity and ADMET properties, as seen in my previous work. }, { SMILES: O=c1ncn2nc(Sc3ccccc3)ccc2c1-c1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1, score: 0.85, justification: This design incorporates trifluoromethyl group, known to improve lipophilicity and target engagement in kinase inhibitors. My research on antiepileptic drugs (Paper 1,3,6,8,9) highlights the importance of halogenated aromatics for CNS penetration, which is relevant for JNK3 inhibition in neurological contexts. The scaffold is synthetically accessible and avoids toxicity concerns from heavy halogens. } C.2. Number of scientists and proposals Figure 5. Fixed total number of proposals. To analyze the impact of the number of scientists and the number of proposals per scientist, we evaluate the interplay between the number of scientists that debate (N ) and the number of proposals that one scientist proposes per round (k) in JNK bioactivity optimization task. First, we fix the total number of proposals = 1, 500. This allows us to investigate the trade-off between scientist diversity (increasing ) against exploration depth (increasing k). By varying the composition, we observe whether the scientist diversity is more critical than the depth of expertise. We provide the results in Figure 4. This demonstrates demonstrate that increasing the number of scientists (N ) consistently enhances discovery performance across both experimental settings. In the fixed total budget scenario, the system maintains relatively high AUC scores even at low N, suggesting that increased exploration depth (k) can partially compensate for limited expertise diversity.

Although these tasks were excluded from the main text due to their nature as arithmetic structural puzzles, we report their performance in Table 7. We observe that INDIBATOR still achieves consistent performance improvements in most cases compared to the vanilla debate. However, we emphasize that these metrics are less indicative of our frameworks true utility, as they do not require the individual profile-grounded reasoning or the broad chemical space exploration that INDIBATOR is designed to facilitate."
