Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to modern developer workflows through AIassisted code completion. In specialized enterprise environments like ServiceNow, model effectiveness depends heavily on context quality, particularly for custom APIs called Script Includes. Script Includes in ServiceNow are reusable JavaScript components that serve as centralized repository for storing functions and classes, enabling developers to encapsulate complex business logic [1]. This paper addresses the critical challenge of context retrieval for LLM-powered code generation in ServiceNows code completion and Build Agent tasks. The core problem is accurately retrieving relevant Script Includes from partial developer code without explicit queries. Traditional methods like keyword search or basic vector search fail to capture nuanced developer intent and lack awareness of complex hierarchical relationships across the ServiceNow platform. General-purpose LLMs also lack domain-specific knowledge, making high-quality retrieval essential for reusing instance-specific Script Includes. We propose DeepCodeSeek, multi-stage retrieval pipeline that maximizes context relevance for LLMs. Our main contributions are: (1) search pipeline using platform metadata and advanced IR techniques to significantly improve retrieval accuracy over baselines; (2) comprehensive post-training pipeline optimizing compact reranker models through synthetic dataset generation, supervised finetuning, and reinforcement learning; and (3) empirical validation showing our optimized 0.6B reranker surpasses 8B models while maintaining significantly reduced latency for real-time applications.

Related Work Our work builds on recent advances in neural code retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural code analysis, and search refinement techniques, adapting them to large-scale enterprise environment. 2.1. Neural Code Retrieval Code search has evolved from keyword-based methods like BM25 [2] to dense retrieval models such as CodeBERT [3], which embed queries and code into shared semantic space. Yet recent evaluations (e.g., CoIR [4]) show that general-purpose dense retrievers degrade in domains different from what they were trained on, mainly because their pretraining rarely covers such niche knowledge. To control for this effect, we adopt BM25 as strong, domain-agnostic baseline that remains competitive under out-of-domain conditions. Our work then targets the missing piece: domain-aware retrieval pipeline tailored to ServiceNow Script Includes. 2.2. RAG with Filtering and Query Enhancement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [5] improves LLM outputs by dynamically providing relevant context, now common in coding assistants [6]. key challenge is ensuring retrieved context relevance, which can be addressed by leveraging code structure [7] and query enhancement techniques. Inspired by Hypothetical Document Embeddings [8], LLMs can generate complete hypothetical code snippets from partial code, creating richer queries. While many systems build Code Knowledge Graphs from source code [9, 10] to enable filtering, our RAG pipeline constructs Knowledge Graph from ServiceNow platform metadata for scope-level filtering. This constrains the search space and enables efficient retrieval of relevant Script Includes within our enterprise-specific context. 2.3. Reranking Following retrieval, cross-encoder or long-context LLM reranker [11] can re-order top candidates, ensuring the most relevant results are prioritized for the final generation step. Recent reinforcementlearning approaches explicitly inject reasoning steps to boost reranking quality: REARANK [12] introduces list-wise reasoning reranking agent, while SWE-RL [13] shows that RL on large-scale software-evolution data substantially improves LLM reasoning for code-centric tasks. Our reranker adopts similar RL fine-tuning strategy but is trained on enterprise-specific Script Include pairs, enabling higher precision in our domain. 3. Proposed Method Our approach is multi-stage retrieval pipeline designed to provide highly relevant Script Includes for code completion. The pipeline begins with setting baseline and incorporates several techniques to progressively refine the search space and improve accuracy. The overall architecture is depicted in Figure 1. The core components of our method are as follows: Knowledge Graph for Search Space Reduction: We leverage Knowledge Graph (KG) constructed from platform metadata to prune the search space. This pre-filtering step significantly narrows the field of potential candidates before the main retrieval stage. Figure 1: Overview of the proposed multi-stage retrieval pipeline. Enriched Indexing: Rather than indexing the raw code, we created structured index. All methods belonging to single Script Include are grouped under their parent namespace. This index is further enriched with SI code metadata and their corresponding structured JSDoc, including API usage example. This organization helps the embedding model better distinguish between different functionalities and reduces ambiguity during retrieval. LLM-Powered Code Expansion: Developers partial code often lacks sufficient context for effective retrieval. To address this, we experimented using Large Language Model (LLM) at runtime to generate more descriptive and effective queries. By analyzing the partial code, the LLM can infer the developers intent and produce more complete code expansion, which in turn leads to more accurate results from the embedding model. Reranking: The initial retrieval stage may return the correct Script Include but not necessarily at the top of the list (e.g., within the top-5 results). For effective code generation, the downstream LLM needs small, highly relevant set of options. Therefore, we employ reranking stage using cross-encoder or LLM reranker to improve the position of the most relevant candidates, aiming to move them from higher values to lower values (e.g., top-40 into the top-5). This ensures better performance, as it is easier for the code generation model to process fewer, higher-quality context options. Post-training optimization: We develop comprehensive training pipeline that optimizes compact reranker models through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to much larger models while maintaining significantly reduced latency. This multi-stage process, combining knowledge-informed search space, enriched indexing, advanced query generation, and re-ranking, forms robust pipeline that significantly outperforms vanilla retrieval methods([2]) for code generation tasks. 4. Dataset and Index Construction 4.1. Dataset Construction We constructed custom evaluation dataset from real-world ServiceNow development scenarios to capture the challenge of API retrieval from partial code. Our dataset consists of 850 code completion scenarios, each containing partial JavaScript code snippet and the corresponding ground truth Script Include that should be used to complete the code. To explain the terms used in our dataset: code_middle: Autocompletion span where the target API is invoked. code_before / code_after: Prefix and suffix around code_middle; the prefix omits the target Script Include so retrieval must rely on context, while the suffix adds extra lines without exposing the API. Figure 2: Task anatomy: highlighting how code_before, and code_after are used to recover the groundtruth Script Include required for code_middle. This setup makes the retrieval task realistic and challenging, because the model must understand the code context without direct hints. The incomplete code provided as the input for completion can be FIM (fill-in-the-middle) or non-FIM format depending on whether code_after is available in the input. To ensure data quality, we employed an LLM judge (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to evaluate the clarity of developer intent in each sample. The judge identified 705 samples (83%) as having clear intent, which we use for our primary evaluation. The remaining 145 samples with ambiguous intent are excluded from our main results but analyzed separately to understand failure cases. 4.2. Index Construction Our search index covers 277 distinct Script Include namespaces containing 3,337 individual APIs. The index documents vary significantly in length: full scripts range from 66 to 10,407 tokens (mean: 2,280), while corresponding JSDoc summaries are more concise, ranging from 157 to 5,368 tokens (mean: 807). Through extensive experimentation, we found that JSDoc summaries provide superior retrieval performance compared to raw code. This is attributed to their structured nature and focused representation of API functionality. Consequently, we use JSDoc summaries for our final optimized index, which provides cleaner signal for retrieval while maintaining comprehensive coverage of API capabilities. 4.3. Knowledge Graph Construction We constructed hierarchical Knowledge Graph from ServiceNow platform metadata to enable efficient search space pruning. The graph captures the relationship between packages, scopes, and Script Includes, allowing us to filter candidates based on contextual relevance before expensive retrieval operations. Appendix details how this metadata-based graph helps reduce search space in our use case. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Evaluation Metrics We evaluate our retrieval pipeline using two primary metrics: Top-K Accuracy: The percentage of queries where the correct Script Include appears in the top-K retrieved results. We report results for = @5, @10, @20, and @40. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): The average of the reciprocal ranks of the correct Script Include across all queries, providing more nuanced view of ranking quality. 5.2. Baselines and Implementation We compare our proposed pipeline against BM25 [2] as the primary baseline, which achieved 53.02% top-40 accuracy on our dataset. Our implementation uses the following components: Embedding Model: Linq-AI-Research/Linq-Embed-Mistral (7B parameters, 32K context length) Reranker Models: Qwen-8B (baseline) and our optimized Qwen-0.6B models Judge Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash (1M context length) for intent clarity evaluation 5.3. Pretraining Knowledge Check To test whether Script Include knowledge was already present in model pretraining corpora, we prompted LLMs to autocomplete our evaluation samples without any retrieval context (non-FIM, no KG, no index). The model produced the correct Script Include namespace in only 5% of cases, indicating limited memorization/coverage and motivating retrieval for this domain. 6. Experiments and Results 6.1. Main Results We evaluate three primary retrieval methods against our BM25 baseline: (1) Prefix Code Embed (Non-FIM), which uses embeddings of the code preceding the cursor; (2) LLM Description, which generates natural language description of user intent; and (3) Hypothetical Code Generation, which generates hypothetical code completions for retrieval. For concise method prompts and working examples, see Appendix and Section I, respectively. Table 1 shows the performance of these methods on our clear-intent evaluation subset (705 samples). The Hypothetical Code Generation method consistently outperforms all other approaches, achieving 87.86% top-40 accuracy, more than doubling the BM25 baseline performance. Table 2 presents the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) results, confirming the superior ranking quality of our approach.

Our optimized 0.6B reranker matches or exceeds the 8B model while maintaining significantly reduced latency. 7. Post Training and Optimization To bridge the performance gap between the 0.6B and 8B Qwen reranker for our use case while enabling real-time predictions, we developed comprehensive post-training pipeline that optimizes compact reranker models to achieve performance comparable to much larger models. The goal is to match or surpass an 8B rerankers ranking quality at much lower latency and cost. This matters in production: 0.6B model fits tighter memory budgets, runs with higher concurrency, and reduces tail latency. Our SFT+RL results now exceed the 8B baseline while keeping the 2.5x latency gain, which makes the approach deployment-ready. 7.1. Training Dataset critical challenge in training our reranker was ensuring no training contamination from our evaluation datasets. To address this, we constructed completely fresh training datasets using previously unused Script Include namespaces. 7.1.1. Dataset for SFT We constructed comprehensive dataset for supervised fine-tuning using subsets of the CodeR-Pile dataset, focusing on JavaScript and TypeScript samples to establish robust foundation for code understanding. This dataset provides the necessary diversity and scale for effective SFT training. 7.1.2. Synthetic Dataset for RL For reinforcement learning we reused Script Include namespaces that never appeared in our training or evaluation data. First, we pulled 892 such namespaces (about 5.9K methods) that had been left out of earlier extraction runs. We then generated fresh JSDoc signatures with an LLM so every namespace had structured documentation in the index. Claude 3.7 analyzed each script and produced synthetic tripletscode_before, code_middle, code_afterwith the target usage placed in code_middle. We cleaned the pool in three passes. We removed 30 samples where the ground-truth namespace leaked into code_before or code_after, dropped another 1015 samples that still mentioned the namespace nearby, and finally used fuzzy matching to cut 894 close variants. This left 285 strong examples. From these we kept 204 samples that offered enough hard negatives via the sentence-transformers mine_hard_negatives helper; the remaining 81 lacked suitable negatives, so we discarded them. 7.2. Training Pipeline Our training approach addressed the challenge of training small model on limited data without overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. The pipeline consisted of three main stages: 7.2.1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) We began with supervised fine-tuning using the dataset described in Section 7: Parameter-Efficient Training: Experiments with full fine-tuning and PEFT + LoRA revealed that LoRA adapters provided the best performance improvements for the 0.6B reranker while maintaining efficiency. Balanced Training: We ensured balanced training by randomly selecting either positive or negative samples during training, preventing class imbalance bias. Figure 3: Qwen 0.6B: Top-5 accuracy after finetuning, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Inference latency Loss Function: We employed negative log-likelihood loss (nll_loss) to optimize for the true document label (1 for positive, 0 for negative). Training exclusively on synthetic samples led to rapid overfitting. The CodeR-Pile dataset alone provided better generalization and superior performance compared to mixed training approaches, indicating that combining synthetic and open-source data did not improve results. 7.2.2. SFT + RL To further improve ranking performance, we implemented GRPO-based reinforcement learning pipeline: Reward Function: Training uses completion-aware binary reward that reads the first token produced in each GRPO rollout; matching the supervision label with yes yields +1, while an incorrect no response receives 1. Sampling eight completions per prompt injects the variance GRPO needs to shift the policy instead of collapsing toward the reference distribution. See Appendix for the full setup and diagnostics. Training Strategy: We observed that RL training on the small synthetic dataset alone led to catastrophic forgetting. The optimal approach involved applying RL to checkpoint from the SFT model trained on the CodeR-Pile dataset, then fine-tuning with our synthetic dataset. Performance Achievement: This two-stage approach enabled the 0.6B model to achieve performance very close to the 8B reranker on our evaluation benchmark dataset. 7.2.3. Extended SFT As an alternative to RL, we experimented with extended supervised fine-tuning where we took the SFT checkpoint trained on the CodeR-Pile dataset and further fine-tuned it separately with our synthetic dataset. While this approach provided decent results, it did not show noticeable improvements over the previous SFT checkpoint. 7.3. Training Results and Validation Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the post-training pipeline. Figure 3 shows the complete post-training results across all stages, while Table 4 presents the detailed performance comparison: The post-training pipeline successfully bridges the performance gap between the 0.6B and 8B models, with the SFT + RL optimized 0.6B model achieving 68.58% top-5 accuracy compared to 66.10% for the 8B modeloutperforming it by 2.48 percentage points. Detailed out-of-distribution evaluation metrics appear in Table 7 in Appendix F.

Conclusion We present DeepCodeSeek, comprehensive solution for real-time API retrieval in enterprise code completion scenarios. Our multi-stage retrieval pipeline achieves 87.86% top-40 accuracy, more than doubling BM25 baseline performance while addressing the critical challenge of inferring developer intent from partial code. Our key contributions are: (1) novel retrieval pipeline combining knowledge graph filtering, enriched indexing with JSDoc documentation, and advanced query enhancement techniques; (2) comprehensive post-training pipeline optimizing compact reranker models through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning; and (3) demonstration that our optimized 0.6B reranker now outperforms the 8B model (68.58% vs 66.10% top-5 accuracy) while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency. Ablation studies show significant component contributions: knowledge graph filtering reduces search space by 59%, enhanced indexing improves accuracy by 31 percentage points, and LLM reranking provides an additional 7 percentage point boost, enabling real-time code completion in production environments. 8.1. Limitations and Future Work Our evaluation has limitations: dataset focus on Script Includes limits generalization to other code completion contexts, synthetic data generation may not capture real-world complexity, and small synthetic dataset size (204 samples) constrains training experiments. Future work will focus on expanding data coverage through larger synthetic dataset generation and real-world data collection, refining the knowledge graph for enhanced filtering, and specializing the reranker for specific code completion tasks."

Ablation Studies We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of each pipeline component. A.1. Knowledge Graph Filtering Our Knowledge Graph, constructed from ServiceNow platform metadata, captures hierarchical relationships across 17,701 Script Includes. Analysis reveals that 84% of new SI usages conform to existing patterns, enabling effective search space reduction. By prioritizing globally scoped Script Includes, we reduce candidate sets by approximately 59% before expensive retrieval operations. A.2. Indexing Strategy Impact Table 5 quantifies the impact of our enhanced indexing strategy. Grouping methods under parent namespaces and enriching with JSDoc documentation provides dramatic improvements across all metrics. Table 5 Impact of Enhanced Indexing (Top-K Accuracy %) Method Index Version @5 @40 Non-FIM 54.12 Baseline Namespace Grouping + JSDoc 58.21 85.36 36. A.3. Reranking Analysis Table 6 shows that the LLM reranker (Gemini 2.5 Flash) provides substantial improvements over crossencoder approaches, achieving 72.60% top-5 accuracy compared to 65.84% for the Qwen Reranker (8B). Table 6 Reranker Comparison (Non-FIM, Dense 20) Reranker @5 (%) @10 (%) @15 (%) Qwen Reranker (8B) LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash) 65.84 72.60 72.95 74.73 74.73 75.80 A.4. Code Trimming and Context Length We analyzed the impact of code trimming and context length on retrieval performance. To avoid bloating the embedding model with excessive or noisy context, we experimented with various lengths of prefix code. Our experiments show that context of 8-10 lines before the cursor yields the best performance, gaining 1.82% relative increase over using larger context in our Prefix Code Embed (Non-FIM) Search. This optimal context length balances the need for sufficient information to infer developer intent while avoiding noise from distant code that may not be relevant to the current retrieval task. Note that the downstream code generation task may require more context. Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between context length and retrieval accuracy. A.5. Code Before vs. After Analysis We investigated whether using code that comes before the cursor (prefix) or after the cursor (suffix) provides better retrieval performance for user code in the middle. Our analysis revealed that the prefix Figure 4: A4 code trimming and context length code consistently outperforms suffix code for Script Include retrieval. This is likely because prefix code better captures the developers intent and the context in which they are working, while suffix code often contains implementation details that are less useful for API retrieval. Suffix code still provides additional boost to the retrieval. Figure 5 shows the performance comparison between using code before and after the cursor position. Figure 5: Performance of Code Context Ablation A.6. Code Proximity and Relevance We conducted an ablation study to examine how the proximity of code elements affects retrieval accuracy. Our experiments revealed critical finding: the maximum information for API retrieval is contained in the last 1-2 lines immediately preceding the API invocation. Our analysis compared different context trimming strategies, including using all lines before the cursor, excluding the last line, excluding the last two lines, and limiting context to ten lines with various exclusions. The results consistently showed that removing the last 1-2 lines before the API invocation leads to significant performance degradation in both Top-K accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), regardless of the overall context length. This finding, as illustrated in 6 suggests that while broader context provides some benefit, the immediate preceding lines contain disproportionately valuable information for predicting the appropriate API. This aligns with the intuitive understanding that developers typically write code in sequential manner, where the most recent lines provide the strongest signals about the intended functionality and API requirements. Figure 6: Effect of Code Proximity on Performance B. Knowledge Graph Analysis An analysis of the Script Include (SI) Knowledge Graph on our developer instance reveals several key insights. The instance contains 2,516 global SIs and 1,744 non-global SIs. By focusing the search on non-global packages and scopes, the search space is reduced by approximately 59%. This is significant improvement, and the search can be narrowed even further. Approximately 97% of non-global SIs follow one-to-one mapping, meaning they are used in only single package and scope. As result, many package-scope pairs map to single SI, often eliminating the need for deeper search within those contexts. C. Ablation Study on Model Selection As preliminary step, we conducted an ablation study on an older version of our dataset to select foundational embedding model. This initial evaluation compared several models, most notably linq-embed-mistral against Jina, which is widely used embedding model for code retrieval. The study was performed without any advanced indexing or retrieval techniques to purely assess the baseline performance of the models. The results, shown in Figure 7, demonstrated that linq-embed-mistral performed significantly better than Jina. Based on these preliminary findings, we chose it for all subsequent experiments in our pipeline. Figure 7: Ablation study comparing the retrieval performance of various models. D. Code Summarization Strategy Chunking the raw Script Include (SI) code proved to be ineffective and, in some cases, degraded retrieval performance. Given the availability of large-context models, we explored alternative summarization techniques. This led to the development of automated JSDoc signature generation, which creates JSDoc signatures from SI code. Using these JSDoc signatures as concise summary of the scripts functionality proved to be more effective strategy, improving the relevance of our retrieval results. Figure 8: Performance comparison between JSDoc-based indexing and raw code descriptions across different retrieval methods. JSDoc indexing shows consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy. Figure 8 demonstrates the performance improvement achieved by using JSDoc documentation compared to raw code descriptions. The comparison shows that JSDoc-based indexing consistently outperforms raw code indexing across different retrieval methods, with particularly significant improvements in top-5 and top-10 accuracy metrics. This improvement is attributed to JSDocs structured nature, which provides cleaner, more focused representations of API functionality while eliminating noise from implementation details. E. Training Loss Analysis E.1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Loss Figure 9 shows the training loss progression during supervised fine-tuning. The model shows stable convergence with the loss decreasing steadily over epochs, indicating effective learning of the ranking task. Figure 9: Training loss progression during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Figure 10 shows the epoch-wise loss during SFT training, providing more granular view of the training progression across different epochs. Figure 10: Epoch-wise loss during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). E.2. Reinforcement Learning Reward Progression Figure 11 shows the reward progression during reinforcement learning training. The completion-aware yes/no reward captures how frequently sampled responses align with the supervision label, so rising curves indicate the model is pushing more of its rollouts toward the correct decision token. Figure 11: Reward progression during reinforcement learning training. E.3. Reinforcement Learning Training Loss Figure 12 shows the training loss during reinforcement learning, providing insight into the convergence behavior of the RL optimization process. Figure 12: Training loss during reinforcement learning. F. Out-of-Distribution Generalization To validate that our training pipeline preserves the base models generalization capabilities, we evaluated all trained models on an out-of-distribution dataset that none of the models had seen during training. Table 7 reports the results. Table 7 Out-of-Distribution Performance Validation Model @5 (%) @10 (%) @15 (%) Qwen 0.6B Base Qwen 0.6B SFT + RL Qwen 0.6B SFT Qwen 0.6B Extended SFT 85.50 85.30 85.10 86.70 89.90 88.90 89.40 91.40 91.30 90.70 90.90 92.10 These results demonstrate that our trained models maintain strong generalization capabilities without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. The Qwen 0.6B models neither significantly outperform nor degrade compared to the base model performance, indicating successful specialization for our specific use case while preserving general code understanding abilities. G. Reward Function for Reinforcement Learning Our reinforcement learning stage uses completion-aware supervision that inspects the first decision token produced by the reranker. Multiple samples per prompt provide the variance GRPO needs, while auxiliary diagnostics monitor the log-odds gap between yes and no generations. G.1. Completion-Based Training Reward The default reward passed to GRPOTrainer is does the following: For every sampled completion, we read the first generated token, case-fold it, and test whether it starts with \"yes\" or \"no\", since that is what the Qwen 0.6B reranker outputs. correct match against the supervision label yields +1.0; an incorrect answer yields 1.0. G.2. Logit-Based Diagnostics We track the mean log-probability of answering \"yes\" on positive and negative labels, respectively. These diagnostics run alongside the completion-based reward and should trend upward for positive documents once the policy improves. Figure 13: Log-probability of answering yes on positive labels. H. Analysis of Query Enhancement Techniques Our results show that while generating description with an LLM can help, it does not always work as well as using the code itself for the search. The main reason is that when the LLM creates natural language summary of the users code, it can sometimes miss important details or keywords. In contrast, the other two methods (Prefix Code Embed (Non-FIM) and Hypothetical Code Generation) use the actual code for retrieval. This provides the search model with more specific information, which likely explains why they perform better in some situations. I. Qualitative Examples of Retrieval Techniques To illustrate the differences between our retrieval methods, this section provides concrete example of how each technique processes the same partial code snippet. I.1. Shared Context: Users Partial Code The following JavaScript code snippet is used as the input for all three retrieval techniques discussed below. The developers intent is to find common elements between two arrays, task for which the ArrayUtil Script Include is the correct tool. prevGrp = [ ] ; c e r = [ ] ; commonGrp = [ ] ; manager ; backupmgr ; r G . push ( n . parm1 ) ; v r = new d c ( _ r _ u ) ; . addQuery ( _ , n . parm2 ) ; . r ( ) ; u n p t = r G . t g ( ) . i ( \" , \" ) ; ( . t ( ) ) { manager = . manager ; backupmgr = . u_backup_manager ; } g 1 = new d c ( _ r _ e r ) ; 1 . addQuery ( group , n . parm2 ) ; 1 . r ( ) ; while ( 1 . t ( ) ) { prevGrp . push ( 1 . r + ) ; } ( = 0 ; ( = 0 ; < r G i . g ; + +) < prevGrp . g ; { + +) { ( r G i [ ] === prevGrp [ ] ) { commonGrp . push ( r G i [ ] + ) ; } } } I.2. Technique 1: Prefix Code Embed (Non-FIM) This method uses trimmed portion of the users code directly as the search query. ( = 0 ; ( = 0 ; < r G i . g ; + +) < prevGrp . g ; { + +) { ( r G i [ ] === prevGrp [ ] ) { commonGrp . push ( r G i [ ] + ) ; } } } Results The model successfully retrieves the correct ArrayUtil API as the top result. 1. ArrayUtil (Correct) 2. Differ 3. LiveFeedCommon 4. XMLDocument 5. OCGroup I.3. Technique 2: LLM Description This method uses an LLM to generate natural language description of the users intent, which is then used as the search query. INTENT : n y r who common p i group membership t and new t v d by an n r t . Results The abstraction to natural language causes the correct API to be ranked second. 1. GlideRecordUtil 2. ArrayUtil (Correct) 3. LiveFeedCommon 4. OCGroup 5. LabelUpdate I.4. Technique 3: Hypothetical Code Generation This method uses an LLM to generate hypothetical completion for the users code. The original code context combined with this hypothetical code forms the search query. ( = 0 ; r ( = 0 ; < r G i . g ; + +) < prevGrp . g ; { + +) { ( r G i [ ] === prevGrp [ ] ) { commonGrp . push ( r G i [ ] + ) ; } } } / @ c t F s m s t i t r t L and v a y and s them h commonGrp a . p e e t o o r n d i common u members w p i and r g p . / ( r G i [ ] === prevGrp [ ] ) { commonGrp . push ( r G i [ ] + ) ; } Results This method also retrieves the correct ArrayUtil API as the top result, demonstrating the effectiveness of using code-based context for our search index. 1.

Prompts for AI Models This appendix details the prompts used for the various models in our pipeline. J.1. Instructor-based Embedding Model The following prompt is used to instruct the embedding model to find relevant APIs based on JSDoc for given code snippet. t t : Given code , n APIs e on i JSDoc t s e might need o e t t e r e .
