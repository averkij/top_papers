Introduction Reliable and trustworthy real-world deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) requires outputs that are verifiable and grounded in models input sources. *Equal contribution 1UNC Chapel Hill 2The University of Texas at Austin. Correspondence to: David Wan <davidwan@cs.unc.edu>. Preprint. February 13, 2026. 1 This grounding is particularly important when problems require multi-step reasoning, which amplifies the risk of hallucinations from propagating errors (Ji et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023), and when producing long-form responses which are harder and more time-consuming to verify (Song et al., 2025; Li et al., 2022). While prior work in temporal video grounding (Hendricks et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2021) and multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (Dong et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2022) has explored grounding multimodal models outputs to their inputs using citations or timestamps, existing studies often focus on simplified settings. Many grounding tasks emphasize observational or retrieval-based grounding, where questions can be answered by directly grounding to relevant evidence in the input source (e.g., How many flags are in front of the U.S. Capitol dome? given an image of the Capitol). In contrast, real-world questions frequently require not only grounding to evidence, but also reasoning over grounded information to synthesize an answer (e.g., the question in Figure 1). Moreover, prior work is typically limited to narrow set of modalities, most commonly visual information. Even in video grounding settings (Hendricks et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2025a; Lei et al., 2019; 2021), existing methods mostly ground to visual inputs or rely on automatically-transcribed text rather than original audio, overlooking modalities such as audio and figures and failing to evaluate joint grounding across heterogeneous multimodal sources. To evaluate MLLMs in more realistic settings requiring reasoning grounded in heterogeneous multimodal inputs, we introduce Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution (MURGAT). We measure different models ability to perform fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. As shown in Figure 1 (top), given multimodal inputs including video, audio, and graphs, models should generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations that refer to the specific modality and temporal segments supporting each claim. To assess models ability to identify and attribute supporting evidence, we decompose response evaluation into three subtasks (Figure 1, bottom). (1) Verifiable claim identification identifies sentences that contain directly observable claims requiring grounding, as opposed to sentences that reflect reasoning steps. This allows attribution quality to be evaluated only over verifiable claims without penalizing unMultimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Figure 1. Overview of MURGAT and the evaluation protocol. The model is given question and multimodal sources and is asked to generate response containing explicit reasoning and precise citations, including the specific modality and timestamp. To evaluate the response, we apply fact-level multimodal attribution protocol. The generated response and its citations are processed through three subtasks: (1) verifiable claim identification, (2) atomic fact decomposition, and (3) attribution quality. grounded reasoning or rewarding unnecessary citations. (2) Atomic fact decomposition further breaks each verifiable sentence into atomic facts, enabling fine-grained evaluation, as single sentence often contains multiple claims (Min et al., 2023). (3) Attribution quality evaluates whether each atomic fact is entailed by the multimodal evidence cited for it. Following text attribution work (Gao et al., 2023b), we measure recall (whether the union of cited segments fully entails the fact) and precision (whether each cited segment is strictly necessary) while accounting for both temporal alignment and modality. To establish reliable reference points for these tasks, we first collect human annotations for all three subtasks of the evaluation pipeline on two datasets, WorldSense (Hong et al., 2025) and Video-MMMU (Hu et al., 2025b), which cover diverse range of multimodal inputs and question types, including those requiring reasoning beyond direct observation. Using these annotations as ground truth, we evaluate range of MLLM variants (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash (Comanici et al., 2025), Gemini-3-Flash and Pro (Google, 2025), and Qwen-3-Omni-Instruct and Thinking (Xu et al., 2025)). We observe that even strong MLLMs perform poorly on the MURGAT task  (Table 1)  : while they are often able to answer questions correctly, they frequently fail to provide sufficient and accurate attribution to the underlying sources. These findings motivate the construction of an automatic, scalable evaluation pipeline MURGAT-SCORE to efficiently benchmark methods and improve attribution ability. We experiment with various strong MLLMs to identify the model with the highest correlation to human judgments for each task, and observe high Pearson correlation of 0.84 when averaged over all steps, substantially outperforming the nextbest LLM-as-judge baseline (r = 0.59). With MURGAT-SCORE, we test state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini models and Qwen-Omni variants. Our experiments reveal that while these models often achieve high question-answering accuracy, they struggle significantly with multimodal attribution, frequently producing hallucinated grounding where incorrect citations are given. We specifically observe that citation generation is taskdependent: it acts as reasoning tax (Zhang et al., 2025; Wan et al., 2025) on simple recognition tasks but scaffolds performance on complex reasoning benchmarks. We further explore programmatic approaches that decouple reasoning from citation generation. While these methods improve attribution quality (avg. +9.6 MURGAT-SCORE), we observe distinct trade-off: forcing explicit grounding often degrades reasoning performance in complex tasks. Finally, we investigate the effect of scaling thinking effort and observe diverging trends: while larger models (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro) improve in grounding with more compute, smaller models show drop in MURGAT-SCORE as effort increases, suggesting latent reasoning processes become disconnected from verifiable evidence. 2 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning 2. Related Work Attribution and Grounding Benchmark. In text domains, prior work (Bohnet et al., 2022; Jacovi et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2023b; Yue et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024) has studied attribution and grounding as mechanisms to mitigate hallucinations and improve the trustworthiness of model outputs by introducing metrics and benchmarks for evaluating citation quality. Several lines of work propose decomposing outputs into atomic facts for finer-grained evaluation, as sentences often contain multiple factual claims (Min et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024). In the multimodal domain, grounding is commonly framed as referring text to specific visual or temporal evidence. Several works (Hu et al., 2025a; Song et al., 2025) evaluate the ability of MLLMs to generate text with citations attributed to visual contents; however, these approaches are limited to image modalities and focus on short outputs. Video grounding tasks, which aim to localize relevant segment given textual query (Hendricks et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2024), are also related. Existing methods (Ren et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025a;b) assume that the target evidence is already specified in the prompt. In our setting, the model must self-select evidence, rather than just selecting timestamp provided in the prompt. Attribution and Grounding Methods. In text domains, existing attribution approaches mainly fall into three groups: (1) Direct generation approaches (Weller et al., 2024) use attribution from parametric knowledge by prompting language models to cite supporting sources during generation. (2) Post-retrieval attribution methods (Nakano et al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022; Asai et al., 2024) incorporate an explicit evidence retrieval step and enable citation-aware reasoning. (3) Post-generation attribution methods (Gao et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024; Hsu et al., 2024) verify or revise claims after the response is produced. Meanwhile, multimodal grounding has become focus in tasks like long video QA (Wang et al., 2025e;d), where models must locate visual segments to support answers. Recent efforts (Wang et al., 2025c; Mahmood et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025f; Li et al., 2025) propose programmatic or agent-based reasoning frameworks that decompose queries into executable steps over video content. Modular reasoning approaches structure multimodal inference through specialized sub-modules or visual programs to improve temporal grounding and interpretability (Surıs et al., 2023; Min et al., 2024). These methods improve multimodal retrieval and reasoning but typically focus on answer accuracy or temporal localization over fine-grained attribution of generated claims. 3. Task and Evaluation In this section, we present MURGAT (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution) in Section 3.1 and describe the evaluation protocol for measuring model performance in Section 3.2. 3.1. MURGAT As illustrated in the top panel of Figure 1, MURGAT is task in which an MLLM is given multimodal inputs from various modalities (e.g., video, audio stream, or figures) and question Q. The model produces response = MLLM(Q, I) consisting of sequence of sentences {ri} with explicit reasoning. For each verifiable sentence ri (i.e., sentence that is observable from the input source I) we require the model to generate an associated citation set Ci = {c1 refers to specific timestamped segment of particular input modality (e.g., (audio, 0:42-0:46)). If Ci = , the sentence ri is not accompanied by any citation. We require that all verifiable claims be supported by citations, and that each claim be strictly entailed by the cited sources. , . . . }, where each citation cj , 3.2. Evaluation Protocol As shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1, to evaluate MURGAT, we introduce an evaluation protocol with three subtasks: identifying verifiable sentences in the response, decomposing them into atomic facts, and evaluating citation quality of these facts. Based on this protocol, we define an evaluation metric, MURGAT-SCORE (MURGAT-S), which measures how well model grounds factual claims to the correct source at the fact-level, without incorrectly penalizing unobservable sentences such as reasoning statements. Subtask 1: Verifiable Claim Identification. In this subtask, the goal is to identify which sentences in generated response are verifiable. This process consists of two stages. First, for each sentence ri R, we prompt an LLM-based verifier to determine whether the sentence is verifiable (Liu et al., 2023a), i.e., whether its claims can be grounded to the multimodal inputs I. This yields filtered set of verifiable sentences: Rv = {ri Verifier(ri, I) = True}. This step distinguishes sentences that are visually or audibly verifiable from those that cannot be grounded (Liu et al., 2023a). We retain sentences describing observable events (visual actions, audio, on-screen text). Conversely, we discard sentences that cannot be directly grounded, such as reasoning statements. For example, in Step 1 of Figure 1, the final sentence (Therefore, the statement that is incorrect) is filtered out as it reflects reasoning rather than observable evidence. In contrast, the first sentence (The video explicitly defines on the graph) is retained, since the definition can be directly observed from the video. Second, among the set of verifiable sentences Rv, we further retain only those with non-empty citation sets (Ci = ) and obtain set of verifiable and citation-covered sentences Rvc = {ri Rv Ci = }. These sentences are 3 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning subsequently passed to the decomposition and attribution subtasks, since attribution quality can only be evaluated when citations are provided. , a2 , . . . , an Subtask 2: Atomic Fact Decomposition. single sentence often contains multiple facts, thus containing mixture of true and false information (Min et al., 2023). To enable fine-grained evaluation, we decompose each sentence ri Rvc into set of atomic facts Ai = {a1 }, where each atomic fact represents minimal, independently verifiable claim. To ensure accurate evaluation, we apply decontextualization (Choi et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2024), where pronouns are resolved to specific entities using the preceding context. Additionally, unlike prior work (Choi et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2024), since our task involves citations, we propagate the citation set Ci associated with each original sentence ri to all atomic facts derived from it, yielding atomic fact-citation pairs {(aj , Ci)} for subsequent attribution evaluation. Subtask 3: Attribution Quality. Given the atomic factcitation pairs {(aj , Ci)}, we evaluate the entailment of each atomic fact with respect to its cited sources. We adopt set-based evaluation protocol used in prior work (Liu et al., 2023a; Gao et al., 2023b). For each verifiable atomic fact aj and its citation set Ci, we perform two-sided citation verification. First, we determine whether the combination Ci fully entails the fact aj of all citation segments ck (Recall). This measures whether the provided citations are sufficient to support the fact. Second, if the atomic fact is supported, we further identify which specific citations ck Ci are strictly necessary for entailment (Precision). This assesses whether each cited segment contributes relevant evidence or whether spurious or overly broad citations are included. Together, these two criteria characterize the quality of multimodal attribution by capturing both missing citations and incorrect or unnecessary citations. 3.3.2. ATTRIBUTION QUALITY Attribution quality evaluates whether the cited multimodal evidence correctly supports each atomic fact. For the set of all atomic facts = (cid:83) Ai, we evaluate the quality of evidence using Precision, Recall, and F1, similar to the definitions in Liu et al. (2023a); Gao et al. (2023b). riRvc Precision: Assesses the relevance of citations. For given response, we calculate precision by pooling all citations found in that response. citation cj Ci is considered relevant if it supports the associated atomic fact. (cid:80) aj Precision = (cid:80) is relevant) ck Ci (cid:80) I(ck Ci aj Recall: Measures the sufficiency of the provided evidence. It is the percentage of atomic facts where the set of citation Ci fully entails the fact aj . Recall = 1 (cid:88) aj I(Ci fully supports aj ) Attribution F1: We derive the final attribution score (Attribution) as the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. Attribution = 2 Precision Recall Precision + Recall 3.3.3. MURGAT-SCORE To provide single holistic score, MURGAT-SCORE scales the attribution quality by the coverage. This penalizes models that hallucinate citations for small subset of facts while leaving the majority ungrounded. MURGAT-SCORE = Coverage Attribution 3.3. Evaluation Metrics 4. Automatic Evaluation We propose evaluating grounding quality along two primary axes: Coverage and Attribution. We then combine these into holistic score, MURGAT-SCORE. 3.3.1. CITATION COVERAGE Citation coverage measures the models ability to correctly provide citations for sentences that require grounding. Specifically, it is defined as the proportion of verifiable sentences that are accompanied by at least one citation: Coverage (%) = Rvc Rv In this section, we describe how we design and identify an automated evaluation pipeline for scalable and efficient benchmarking by prompting different models to simulate the three annotation steps and showing high correlations with human judgments (Section 4.2, Section 4.3, and Section 4.4). Finally, using the best methods from the individual subtasks, we develop the final metric, MURGAT-SCORE and evaluate in an end-to-end manner in Section 4.5. Before introducing an automated metric, we construct sample of human annotations and evaluate current MLLMs with the human annotations samples (Section 4.1). 4.1. Human Annotation high score indicates that the model consistently provides attributions for verifiable content. To benchmark models and validate automatic metrics, we first constructed human annotations for all three stages of the 4 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Table 1.

To capture diverse model behaviors, we randomly sampled 10 examples from each of two datasets: Video-MMMU (Hu et al., 2025b) and WorldSense (Hong et al., 2025), both of which feature multimodal inputs and complex queries. We elicit human judgments on outputs from four widely used and strong MLLMs, Gemini-2.5Flash (Comanici et al., 2025), Gemini-3-Pro (Google, 2025), Qwen3-Omni-Instruct (Xu et al., 2025), and Qwen3-OmniThinking (Xu et al., 2025), on the sampled 20 examples, yielding 80 model-generated responses. Human annotators are provided with input sources and model-generated responses, along with stage-specific instructions. More details of human annotation are in Appendix A. Results. Before introducing an automated metric, we report the scores human annotators gave to each model on the sampled videos from WorldSense and Video-MMMU, reporting our evaluation metrics (Coverage, Attribution F1) as well as the QA accuracy of each model. In Table 1, we find that models are far from ceiling performance in terms of coverage and attribution F1, with inconsistent trends between models and no single model performing consistently on both datasets. Moreover, scores on Video-MMMU which requires detailed grounding to complex visual sources like plots are generally lower than those on WorldSense, despite the QA accuracy scores being higher. These results underscore the challenge this task poses to even strong MLLMs, and highlight the need for an automated and more scalable evaluation method. Qualitative analysis further suggests fundamental trade-off between narrative synthesis and grounding precision; while larger models often hallucinate spatial or temporal details to maintain narrative fluency, models like Gemini-2.5-Flash achieve higher faithfulness through minimalist, shot-by-shot descriptions (see Section D.2 for detailed case study and examples). 4.2. Subtask 1: Verifiable Claim Identification Dataset. From our annotated data, we collate sentencelevel dataset of 580 examples, each consisting of sentence paired with human label indicating its verifiability. Methods. We evaluate three different models using three distinct prompting styles, following Jacovi et al. (2025): Simple prompt that directly outputs binary decision; Table 2.

(2025) as top-performing method. Prompts are in Appendix and results on additional models can be found in Appendix B.1. Metric. As this task involves binary decision, we evaluate performance based on Balanced Accuracy (BAcc), standard practice for unbalanced labels (Laban et al., 2022). Results. The results are presented in Table 2. We observe that Gemini-3-Pro with the JSON prompt achieves the highest performance (84.2 BAcc), with the same models CoT version performing the next best (81.4 BAcc). 5 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning 4.3. Subtask 2: Atomic Fact Decomposition Dataset. We collate human-written atomic fact dataset of 635 examples, each consisting of paired sentence and list of corresponding human-written atomic facts. Methods. We design the prompt following prior work (Min et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024), providing in-context examples to illustrate the desired output format (See Appendix E.1). Our task of atomic fact decomposition must account for decontextualization and attribution alignment. We investigate prompting strategies at different levels of granularity: sentence-level, in which atomic facts are generated one sentence at time, versus response-level, in which the model generates all atomic facts for the entire response in single pass. Furthermore, we ablate the decontextualization step, testing the presence or absence of explicit decontextualization, as well as integrating it into single-pass generation versus treating it as distinct intermediate step. Metric. To evaluate the similarity between model-generated atomic facts and references, we adopt the metric proposed by Liu et al. (2023b), using Rouge (Lin, 2004) scores calculated via greedy matching. Precision is calculated for each modelgenerated fact by finding the maximum Rouge-1 F1 score over reference atomic facts and averaging the results. Recall is computed similarly using the reference facts against the generated facts. The final F1 score is the harmonic mean of these precision and recall values. For the F1 score, we strip citations during this phase to focus exclusively on decomposition quality. We also check whether citations are correctly propagated to the corresponding atomic facts (citation propagation). Specifically, for each atomic fact derived from sentence, we consider the match to be correct only if the citation list of the atomic fact is identical to that of the original sentence, with no missing or additional citations. More details can be found in Appendix B.2. Results. As shown in Table 3, the sentence-level approach consistently achieves higher scores compared to responselevel methods. We observe performance drop when moving to response-level generation, suggesting that prompting models in smaller chunks is crucial for performance. Furthermore, omitting the decontextualization step hurts performance across both sentence and response levels, and asking the model to perform decontextualization implicitly (internally) yields worse results than explicit steps. This confirms the necessity of breaking this complex problem into subtasks. The best performing configuration explicit decontextualization followed by atomic fact decomposition at the sentence level using Gemini-3-Pro achieves an F1 of 81.8. Regarding citation accuracy, while Gemini-3-Pro reaches 86.4%, the general trend indicates that correct citation prediction remains challenging task. Table 4.

For the entailment task, we use the atomic facts from verifiable sentences in the human annotations. To evaluate recall and precision, we query the model to provide judgments on combined sources (for recall) and individual sources (for precision) for all verifiable examples. This process yields 917 test examples and 129 validation examples through human annotation. Methods & Metric. We employ the same setup as for verifiable claim identification, but focus on the entailment objective. We adapt the prompt from Jacovi et al. (2025) and utilize the same evaluation metrics (F1 and BAcc). Results. Table 2 shows that the JSON prompt with Gemini3-Pro achieves the highest F1 (73.1). However, Gemini2.5-Flash with the Simple prompt is highly competitive, achieving an F1 of 72.9, only 0.2 points behind the best model. Given this marginal difference, we select Gemini2.5-Flash as the default model for running entailment in our pipeline to maximize efficiency. 4.5. End-to-End Evaluation Finally, we evaluate the metric end-to-end by calculating correlations with human annotation scores. Based on the results in Table 2 and Table 3, our final MURGAT-SCORE employs Gemini-3-Flash for decomposition, Gemini-3-Pro for determining verifiability, and Gemini-2.5-Flash for attribution entailment, balancing performance with cost. For comparison, we evaluate MURGAT-SCORE against several prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge metrics, ranging from response-level judgments to sentence-level granularity. Specifically, we compare against:(1) Holistic, which provides single score ranging from 15; (2) Disentangled, which asks the model to provide distinct scores for coverage, attribution recall, and precision; and (3) Disentangled (sentence-level), which asks the model to provide these three scores at the sentence level. To ensure strong performance, we use Gemini-3-Pro for these baselines. Table 4 shows the correlation between human judgements and different evaluation methods. We observe that as we increase in granularity, performance improves; prompting at the sentence level yields notably higher correlations Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning than response-level approaches, particularly for coverage (r = 0.76 vs. 0.58). MURGAT-SCORE consistently outperforms all baselines across all dimensions, achieving near-perfect correlation on coverage (r = 0.97) and strong gains in attribution precision and recall. This validates the effectiveness of our fine-grained atomic fact decomposition over standard sentence-level prompting. Full correlation results can be seen in Table 12. 5. Generation Experiments Experiments on the human annotation dataset  (Table 1)  show that even strong MLLMs find MURGAT challenging. In this section, we use our automated evaluation pipeline to investigate why models struggle with this task and to identify factors that improve performance at scale. Section 5.1 describes the experimental setup. Section 5.2 presents results across various base models and citation variants (intrinsic citation generation vs. post-hoc attribution). Finally, we analyze the impact of factors known to improve attribution and reasoning, including programmatic multimodal grounding (Section 5.4) and test-time compute scaling (Section 5.3). 5.1. Experimental Setup We evaluate on Video-MMMU and WorldSense, sampling 100 examples distinct from the human annotation set. We measure answer accuracy via string matching against the golden answer choice (Hong et al., 2025), and MURGATSCORE using automatic evaluation. Given our focus on combined audio and visual inputs, we evaluate five representative models capable of handling both modalities: Gemini-2.5-Flash, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-3-Pro, Qwen3Omni-Instruct, and Qwen3-Omni-Thinking. We also include vision-language models that can only process vision information but not audio: Qwen3-VL-instruct, Qwen3VL-thinking, and Molmo2-8B. We evaluate over three variants: (1) direct generation, where the model provides reasoning and an answer (BASE), (2) generation with citations (+CITATION) following Gao et al. (2023b), and (3) post-hoc attribution method (POST-HOC ATTRIBUTION), which simulates temporal visual grounding by prompting the model to provide citations for each sentence if necessary. Prompts are shown in Appendix E. 5.2. Main Results We present the primary evaluation in Table 5. Overall, models struggle significantly with multimodal attribution, achieving peak MURGAT-S of 69.2 on WorldSense and 56.9 on Video-MMMU (Gemini-3-Flash). While Coverage is generally high, attribution remains the bottleneck. Even the best-performing models fail to ground roughly 30-35% of their claims, highlighting the difficulty of precise temporal grounding. 7 Impact of Citations is Task-Dependent. Contrary to the hypothesis that citing evidence always improves performance, we observe divergence based on task type. On the recognition-focused WorldSense, requiring citations often imposes reasoning tax, slightly decreasing accuracy (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro drops from 71.4% to 70.0%), as observed in Zhang et al. (2025); Wan et al. (2025). Conversely, on the reasoning-intensive Video-MMMU, citations often improve accuracy (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro improves from 85.3% to 86.0%, and Qwen-3-VL-Thinking jumps from 51.0% to 60.0%). This suggests that while citation generation overhead hinders simple retrieval, it may scaffold complex reasoning chains. More details are in Appendix D.2. Models with Chain-of-Thought capabilities (e.g., QwenOmni-Thinking) exhibit unique failure mode: citations significantly boost their accuracy (e.g., +9.0% on VideoMMMU), yet they struggle to output valid timestamp formats during generation. This results in extremely low citation MURGAT-S scores (e.g., 4.8), requiring Post-hoc methods to recover grounding performance. We further analyze this with program-aided generation in Section 5.4. Higher Accuracy = Better Grounding. Similar to the initial observation in Table 1, high-performing models are not necessarily trustworthy. On Video-MMMU, Gemini-3Pro (+CITATION) achieves matched accuracy (86.0) with Gemini-3-Flash (+CITATION), yet Gemini-3-Flash maintains significantly higher MURGAT-S (56.9 vs 41.8). This indicates that stronger models often rely on parametric knowledge to answer correctly while hallucinating supporting citations, underscoring the necessity of MURGAT-S as an independent measure. Post-hoc Attribution: Recognition vs. Reasoning. Applying +POST-HOC ATTRIBUTION yields the highest Coverage, but its impact on attribution quality splits by domain. On WorldSense (recognition), Post-hoc consistently improves MURGAT-S (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro: 51.7 65.2) by accurately locating visual entities. However, on VideoMMMU (reasoning), Post-hoc causes Attribution to plummet (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash: 41.5 38.0). Qualitatively, post-hoc methods tend to force-align abstract reasoning steps to random segments, creating false positives. More details are discussed in Appendix D.2. Omni Models vs. Vision-Language Baselines. We observe distinct trade-off between modality breadth and reasoning depth. On WorldSense, Vision-Language (VL) models achieve low accuracy due to the lack of audio processing; consequently, Qwen-Omni-Instruct significantly outperforms Qwen-3-VL-Instruct (57.0% vs 50.0%). This trend reverses on the reasoning-intensive Video-MMMU (53.0% vs 45.0%), likely because VL models prioritize longcontext visual encoding, avoiding the real-time streaming trade-offs inherent to Omni architectures. However, compaMultimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Table 5. Overall performance on WorldSense and Video-MMMU.

As detailed in Table 13, VL models frequently hallucinate audio citationscomprising up to 31.6% of their references despite lacking an audio encoder. This indicates that their grounding often relies on visual proxies or hallucinations rather than genuine auditory understanding. Thus, high MURGAT-S for VL models merely reflects an ability to ground observations, which are often irrelevant visual details rather than the causal reasoning chain required to reach the gold answer. 5.3. Impact of Reasoning Effort While increased reasoning depth typically improves task performance, its impact on attribution is less clear. We analyze models across different thinking effort levels (Minimal to High). As shown in Figure 2, we observe diverging trends between models. For Gemini-3-Flash on WorldSense, increased reasoning effort counter-intuitively leads to decline in attribution quality, with MURGAT-SCORE dropping from 69.7 (Minimal) to 64.4 (High). This suggests that for the Flash model, internal latent reasoning may be somewhat incompatible with the explicit retrieval required for external verification. Interestingly, on Video-MMMU, Gemini-3Flash peaks at Medium effort (91.5% Accuracy), indicating specific sweet spot for reasoning duration. In contrast, Gemini-3-Pro demonstrates positive scaling on WorldSense: increasing reasoning effort from Low to High results in +6.1 point increase in MURGAT-SCORE and +7.4 point boost in accuracy. This indicates that stronger models are better equipped to align their reasoning chains with external evidence. 5.4. Programmatic Multimodal Grounding To evaluate how prior frameworks designed to improve attribution quality perform on our benchmark, we extend prior work on program-aided generation (Wan et al., 2025; Slobodkin et al., 2024) to our challenging multimodal setting. We explore design space along two axes: (1) Reasoning Paradigm: Logic-Centric (imperative Python-like code) vs. Narrative-Centric (declarative natural language steps); and (2) Grounding Mechanism: Declarative (Planner-Defined), where the model predicts timestamps directly, vs. Imperative (Executor-Discovered), where the model generates search queries for retrieval tool. Complementing these axes, we integrate runtime refinement mechanism to verify that atomic operations are strictly entailed by input evidence, ensuring high grounding fidelity throughout the execution loop. 8 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Figure 2. Gemini models performance with different thinking levels. Unlike prior tasks focused on retrieval or simple observation, MURGAT targets complex scenarios requiring models to synthesize answers from video, audio, and figures while providing precise evidentiary support. To evaluate this rigorously, we developed MURGAT-SCORE, decomposed, fine-grained automatic evaluation pipeline with high correlation to human judgments. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that the capability to reason does not imply the capability to ground. We identified key failure modes, including the tendency of post-hoc methods to hallucinate mappings in complex reasoning tasks and the trade-off between programmatic rigor and narrative accuracy. We hope MURGAT and MURGAT-SCORE facilitate future research into reconciling these capabilities, moving towards MLLMs that are both accurate and faithful."

Gemini-3-Flash results with program-aided generation on Worldsense. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 10, program-aided frameworks consistently enhance attribution quality on Worldsense. Compared to the BASE + CITATION baseline, programmatic methods yield an average MURGAT-SCORE gain of +9.6 points, with the LOGIC IMPERATIVE variant achieving the highest performance (76.4). Notably, Imperative methods consistently outperform Declarative ones (e.g., Logic Imperative 76.4 vs. Declarative 74.3), suggesting that allowing models to execute search queries is more effective than direct timestamp prediction. However, this improvement in attribution comes at the cost of answer accuracy, which drops by an average of 7.4 points. This trade-off aligns with observations by Wan et al. (2025), suggesting that while explicit structuring aids verification, it may constrain the models inherent reasoning flexibility. 6.

(b) Annotation UI for Verification Worthiness. A. Human Evaluation Details To validate our automatic metrics, we developed multi-stage human annotation protocol. The protocol consists of three stages: atomic decomposition, verifiable claim identification, and attribution quality. While the evaluation protocol described in Section 3.2 performs the verifiable claim identification at the sentence-level, we ask annotators to do this step at an atomic-fact level for comprehensiveness that allows future research with more fine-grained data. Note that in our evaluation framework, we use sentence-level verifiable claim identification, as we observe similar performance but much lower cost, as detailed in Appendix B.1. A.1. Data and Models To encompass diverse model behaviors, we sampled inputs from Video-MMMU (Hu et al., 2025b), which focuses on figures and graphs with audio, and WorldSense (Hong et al., 2025), which emphasizes video and audio interpretation. As these require models to have both visual and audio reasoning capabilities, we evaluated four MLLMs: Gemini-2.5-Flash (Comanici et al., 2025), Gemini-3-Pro (Google, 2025), Qwen3-Omni-Instruct, and Qwen3-Omni-Thinking (Xu et al., 2025). The models were prompted to generate answers containing reasoning processes and citations. See prompt in Figure 11. We randomly select 10 examples from Video-MMMU and WorldSense each, resulting in 80 generations. These 80 generations yielded total of 600 sentences. A.2. Atomic Decomposition Guidelines. Two annotators decomposed complex sentences into independent atomic units according to the following guidelines: Pronouns were resolved using strictly prior context (forward-only) to prevent information leakage, while meta-talk (e.g., The video shows) was stripped. critical addition to our protocol is manual citation propagation. Rather than inheriting all citations from the source sentence, annotators assigned specific timestamps (e.g., distinct visual vs. audio evidence) strictly to their relevant atomic facts. Finally, logical reasoning steps, mathematical operations, and compound visual attributes were decomposed to allow for precise partial-credit verification. The annotation interface is shown in Figure 4a. Annotation Details. To accelerate the process, we used Gemini-3-Pro to generate an initial candidate list of facts, similar to Min et al. (2023). Following this drafting phase, annotators manually refined the outputs. This included decontextualization, where annotators resolved pronouns and ambiguous references based on the full generation context to ensure each fact was self-contained. The process required an average of 35.7 seconds per sentence, with consensus resolution taking an additional 48.2 seconds. On average, the dataset contains 25.6 atomic facts per response. A.3. Verifiable Claim Identification Annotation Guidelines. Annotators evaluated each atomic fact to determine if it describes verifiable video content, process referred to as verifiable claim identification. fact is classified as verifiable if it describes specific visual or audio events, claims such as dates and locations, or the absence of an object. Conversely, facts are filtered out as non-verifiable based on three criteria: Task Meta-data & Reasoning (e.g., Therefore, Option is correct.), General Knowledge & Definitions (e.g., Cars are 14 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Figure 5.

This judgment was performed strictly at the atomic-fact level to ensure granular coverage. The annotation interface is illustrated in Figure 4b. Annotation Details. During this stage, we observed moderate inter-annotator agreement of 73.7%. Analysis revealed that these disagreements were primarily due to varying sensitivity thresholds, where one annotator might miss subtle verifiable claim, as evidenced by the significantly higher agreement in the subsequent attribution evaluation stage. Consequently, we adopted Union Strategy (OR-gate) for this phase, retaining any atomic fact marked as verifiable by at least one annotator. This inclusive approach preserved 15.2% of the dataset (N=216) that would have been discarded under strict consensus model, thereby ensuring high recall. While our final proposed evaluation framework utilizes simplified sentence-level verifiable claim identification followed by atomic decomposition, this atomic-level annotation was essential for establishing high-quality, high-recall gold standard. Over-citation Analysis. Although our primary coverage metric focuses on verifiable facts, we also investigated instances where the model provides citations for sentences deemed not verifiable (over-citation). Our analysis identified 37 sentences classified as not verifiable by humans; of these, only 3 sentences contained model citations. This represents an over-citation rate of only 8%, suggesting that while over-citation occurs, it affects only small portion of the non-verifiable content. A.4. Attribution Annotation Guidelines. Human annotators validated the model-generated timestamps for facts deemed verifiable in the previous phase. To maximize efficiency and ensure the context of the atomic fact remained fresh in the annotators mind, we combined the verification-worthiness and attribution tasks into single annotation run. Once fact was marked as verifiable, the interface immediately prompted the annotator to evaluate the attribution across two dimensions. First, they evaluated Recall (Support), determining if the cited segments, when combined, provided sufficient evidence to entail the fact. Second, if the fact was supported, they evaluated Precision (Necessity) by selecting the specific checkboxes for only those timestamps strictly required to prove the claim. This second step allowed annotators to filter out irrelevant timestamps, effectively penalizing citation dumping behaviors. The annotation UI is shown in Figure 5. Annotation Details. The inter-annotator agreement on the verification of these claims reached 86.1%. This level of reliability is notably high and compares favorably to similar state-of-the-art verification benchmarks, such as Liu et al. (2023a), which reported pairwise agreement of 82.2%. This strong consensus justifies our use of the Union Strategy in the preceding phase, as it confirms that annotators are highly consistent once claim has been identified for checking. 15 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Table 7.

Full Statistics We show the full statistics of Table 1 in Table 6, showing the number of sentences, number of atomic facts, and also the detailed breakdown of attribution recall and precision. B. Automatic Evaluation Details B.1. Verifiable Claim Identification To evaluate verifiable claim identification, we adapt human annotations by treating verifiable claims as positive instances and all other claims as negative instances. Given the text-centric nature of this task, we expand our evaluation beyond the Gemini family to include Gemma-3-27b-it (Gemma Team, 2025) and GPT-5.2 (OpenAI, 2025), with results for both sentence-level and atomic-fact level granularity presented in Table 7. Gemini-3-Pro achieves the highest performance across both levels, followed closely by GPT-5.2 (CoT) at the sentence level by narrow 0.3-point margin. While performance trends remain consistent across granularities, we observe that Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) scores are highly comparable. Consequently, due to the significantly higher computational cost associated with atomic-fact decomposition, we adopt sentence-level evaluation as our primary metric for the remainder of this study. B.2. Atomic Fact Decomposition We present full results for atomic fact decomposition in Table 8, including additional models such as Gemma-3-27b-it and GPT-5.2. We also evaluate response-level approach, where the model generates all atomic facts for the entire response in single pass. As shown in the table, performance drops noticeably at the response level compared to the sentence level. Our results underscore the importance of explicit decontextualization and the separation of the pipeline into distinct stages. For example, Gemini-3-Pro achieves 2-point gain in F1 when using decontextualization compared to when it is omitted. Furthermore, separating decontextualization and decomposition into two stages yields 3-point gain over the single-pass method (where the model performs both implicitly). This confirms the utility of two-stage pipeline for generating high-quality atomic facts. Similarly, citation accuracy is consistently highest when the process is decomposed into two stages. C. Programmatic Multimodal Grounding We introduce framework designed to improve grounding fidelity by structurally decoupling reasoning from attribution. Inspired by recent advances in program-aided generation (Wan et al., 2025; Slobodkin et al., 2024), the model operates on 16 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Table 8.

Rather than generating direct textual response, the model first constructs structured plan composed of executable modules. This approach ensures that every claim is explicitly linked to retrieved source, allowing for automatic and verifiable citation assignment. Our primary research objective is to identify the optimal programmatic structure for faithful multimodal grounding. To this end, we explore the design space along two orthogonal axes: the Reasoning Paradigm (the style of the program) and the Grounding Mechanism (how evidence is localized). C.1. Axis 1: Reasoning Paradigm This axis defines the semantic structure of the generated program and the nature of its intermediate artifacts. We contrast two dominant approaches: Logic-Centric. Exemplified by ViperGPT (Surıs et al., 2023), this paradigm treats the multimodal source as structured database to be queried. The generated programs are imperative (e.g., Python scripts) utilizing control flow (loops, conditionals) and abstract variables (e.g., boolean flags, integer counts). While highly effective for verifiable, objective queries (e.g., How many muffins are on the table?), the intermediate steps are often opaque data structures that lack human-readable context, potentially obscuring the reasoning chain. Narrative-Centric. Exemplified by Generation Programs (Wan et al., 2025), this paradigm treats the source as narrative to be reconstructed. The program consists of declarative function calls (e.g., describe, synthesize) that produce semantic, natural language outputs at every step. This style prioritizes contributive attribution, ensuring that the reasoning trace itself serves as verifiable, human-readable explanation of the final answer. C.2. Axis 2: Grounding Mechanism This axis defines when and how specific evidentiary segments (timestamps, bounding boxes) are identified within the pipeline. We investigate the trade-off between planner control and executor robustness. Planner-Defined (Declarative Grounding). In this setting, the MLLM perceives the video content during the planning phase and explicitly commits to citations within the generated code (e.g., describe(00:15-00:20, ...)). This mimics text-based retrieval approaches where models select sentence indices from context window. This approach grants Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning the planner maximum control over the narrative flow but relies heavily on the MLLMs internal ability to localize events without hallucination. Executor-Discovered (Imperative Grounding). Here, the MLLM delegates the localization task to specialized tool during execution (e.g., events = find(boy holding ball)). Rather than hypothesizing timestamps, the planner instead defines the search criteria. This approach is theoretically more robust against hallucination, as it relies on the recall of the retrieval tool rather than the models parametric memory, but it shifts the burden of performance to the retrieval tool. C.3. Refinement Mechanism To further enhance grounding fidelity, we integrate post-hoc optimization strategy into the execution loop. Building on findings that structured programs facilitate verification (Wan et al., 2025), we implement runtime attribution check, which showed improvement in grounding performance in early experiments. After each execution step, we verify that the output of function call is entailed by its input evidence. This ensures that individual atomic operations maintain high attribution standards before their results are aggregated into the final response. C.4. Implementation We instantiate the model as Python-based framework capable of operating across both axes described above. The core library consists of three atomic operations adapted for multimodal inputs: 1. find event(query) List[Timestamp]: retrieval tool to locate relevant segments based on semantic queries. 2. describe(timestamp event ref, instruction) str: vision-language call that inspects specific segment and generates dense textual description grounded in the visual evidence. 3. synthesize(evidence list, instruction) str: logical deduction step that aggregates previous descriptions to answer the user query without accessing the raw video, forcing reliance on the retrieved evidence. C.5. Results This structure imposes penalty on complex reasoning tasks; on Video-MMMU, the base models consistently outperform the programmatic variants in accuracy (e.g., drop from 90.0% to 84.7% for Gemini-3-Flash), indicating that while enforcing plan-then-execute structure curbs correct for the wrong reasons behavior, it may excessively constrain the models flexibility on questions requiring holistic video understanding. D. Additional Results. D.1. Full Results Table 9 presents the complete main results, while detailed performance metrics for reasoning and program-aided tasks are provided in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively. Additionally, full correlation metrics are documented in Table 12. Finally, we show the breakdown of attribution precision by modality in Table 13. D.2. Qualitative Analysis Gemini-3-Pro vs Gemini-3-Flash. In Table 1, we observe that Gemini-3-Pro performs worse than Gemini-3-Flash in attribution. We show the example in Figure 6. Qualitative analysis reveals that model-specific performance is often dictated by fundamental trade-off between narrative synthesis and grounding precision. Specifically, we find that while larger models like Gemini-3-Pro attempt more intricate reasoning and spatial synthesis to provide cohesive description, they are frequently susceptible to spatial hallucinations and temporal misalignment. These errors typically occur when the model attempts to build global context across multiple cuts or infer details not explicitly visible in the cited frame. In contrast, Gemini-2.5-Flash often achieves higher Attribution scores by adopting minimalist, shot-by-shot descriptive strategy. By prioritizing direct, verifiable observations over high-level narrative context, the smaller model avoids the contextualization trap where reasoning overrules precise visual evidence. This suggests that the drive for narrative fluency in larger models can occasionally compromise the faithfulness of their grounding citations. 18 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Table 9.

Our analysis of post-hoc attribution reveals divergent impact across perceptual and deductive benchmarks, as illustrated in Figure 7. In perceptual tasks like WorldSense, post-hoc attribution serves as critical mechanism for multimodal reinforcement. Decoupling the initial generation from the grounding process allows the model to perform second perceptual pass that captures granular scene elements overlooked during the initial reasoning. This improves attribution recall and ensures the descriptive narrative is fully grounded. Conversely, on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like VideoMMMU, the post-hoc process introduces grounding overhead that compromises precision. Because the model relies on internal domain knowledge to solve complex problems, the subsequent attribution step forces mapping 19 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Table 12.

This results in performative citation, where the model anchors technical facts to generic introductory frames or irrelevant diagrams. These results indicate that while post-hoc attribution effectively grounds omnimodal perception, it introduces faithfulness noise in deductive tasks by incentivizing the model to fabricate visual evidence for internal reasoning steps. Program-Aided Generation. We present comparison of program-aided variants in Figure 8, where performance is largely governed by the interaction between execution style and synthesis logic. As presented in Table 10, an accuracy-attribution gap is observed in the Logic Imperative variant; despite achieving the highest attribution (78.7 F1), its accuracy (60.0) remains lower than the BASE + POST-HOC variant (67.0). This suggests that program-aided models can become distracted by the verification processfinding correct evidence but failing to synthesize it accurately during the final stepwhereas the base models benefit from holistic view without the noise of intermediate outputs. In contrast, Narrative Imperative excels in Recall/Coverage (80.7/99.0). Its instructional nature forces the model to execute specific actions, while the narrative style removes strict logical constraints, resulting in chatty output that observes nearly all scene elements but lacks the precision to filter irrelevant noise. Finally, LOGIC DECLARATIVE offers the most stable performance across program-aided variants, with high precision (75.2) and balanced accuracy (61.0). By defining specific facts to be checked rather than open-ended instructions, Declarative prompts minimize the trace drifting common in long Imperative executions, ensuring that grounding remains focused and faithful to the task. We note it is difficult to balance attribution with accuracy. 20 Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning Example 1 Gemini-2.5-Flash (Score: 1.0) Gemini-3-Pro (Score: 0.61) ...boy with dreadlocks... introduces the song by saying, This is called, song to you (audio, 0:06-0:07). ...male character... states, This is called Song To You (audio, 0:06).

Break down the provided Source Sentence into list of independent, Role: Task: self-contained atomic facts. Definitions: 1. Atomic Fact: short, standalone sentence containing singular piece of information (e.g., an action, an objects presence, specific property, or quantity). 2. Citations: Parenthetical references like (visual, 0:00) or (audio, 1:05). Critical Rules: 1. Meta-Talk & Metadata Removal: Remove navigational phrases that describe the video medium rather than the content. Remove: \"The video shows,\" \"The audio contains,\" \"We can see,\" \"The narrator states,\" \"In the first example.\" Keep: The actual content shown or stated. Example: \"The video shows boy holding guitar (visual, 0:05).\" \"- boy is holding guitar (visual, 0:05).\" Example: \"The narrator says Hello (audio, 0:10).\" \"- person says Hello (audio, 0:10).\" Ignore Metadata: Do not create facts about the video structure itself (e.g., ignore \"The clip ends at 0:55\" unless its relevant to the narrative content). 2. Adherence to Original Text: Adhere strictly to the original wording for technical terms, formulas, values, and equations. exactly as they appear in the source). Do not reformat or interpret them (e.g., keep LaTeX or math symbols 3. Granularity (Split Adjectives & Actions): Split compound properties. \"The music is lyrical and flowing\" becomes two facts: one for \"lyrical\", one for \"flowing\". Split compound actions. \"He runs and jumps\" becomes two facts. 4. Citation Logic: Propagation: If the source sentence has citation, every resulting atomic fact must inherit it. Splitting: If citations are embedded (e.g., \"A (visual, 1:00) hits (visual, 2:00)\"), assign the specific citation only to the relevant fact. No Valid Citation: If the source text contains no citations, do not add any. Output the facts without citations. Examples: Input: black vest, stands at microphone (visual, 0:06). Output: male character with long dreadlocks, dressed in pink button-down shirt and male character is present (visual, 0:06). The character has long dreadlocks (visual, 0:06). The character is dressed in pink button-down shirt (visual, 0:06). The character is dressed in black vest (visual, 0:06). The character stands at microphone (visual, 0:06). The video states that product costs include direct material, direct labor, and Input: overhead (visual, 0:15-0:18; audio, 0:15-0:18). Output: Product costs include direct material (visual, 0:15-0:18; audio, 0:15-0:18). Product costs include direct labor (visual, 0:15-0:18; audio, 0:15-0:18).

Task: with specific entity names, strictly adhering to chronological availability of information. Primary Directive: You must resolve references based ONLY on information established in the text prior to the sentence you are editing. The Forward-Only Rule Forbidden: Do not back-fill details. If Sentence 1 says man enters and Sentence 2 says The doctor sits, you cannot change Sentence 1 to The doctor enters. (We didnt know he was doctor yet). Allowed: If Sentence 1 introduces Jeff and Sentence 2 says He, you must change He to Jeff. Strict Constraints: 1. Preserve Citations: exactly where it appears in the text. Keep every citation (e.g., (visual, 0:05), [audio, 0:03-0:08]) Do not move or merge them. 2. Verify Claims: Do not add descriptive adjectives (like red car, angry man) unless that specific sentence or prior one explicitly establishes that attribute. 3. Minimalism: Replace the pronoun with the closest sufficient noun (e.g., replace it with the creature, not the giant one-armed red creature unless necessary for disambiguation).
