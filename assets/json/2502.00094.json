While Arabic LLMs have seen notable progress, Arabic LMMs remain largely unexplored, often narrowly focusing on a few specific aspects of the language and visual understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIN-the Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model-designed to excel across diverse domains. AIN is an English-Arabic bilingual LMM designed to excel in English and Arabic, leveraging carefully constructed 3.6 million high-quality Arabic-English multimodal data samples. AIN demonstrates state-of-the-art Arabic performance, while also possessing strong English-language visual capabilities. On the recent CAMEL-Bench benchmark comprising 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding, our AIN demonstrates strong performance with the 7B model outperforming GPT-4o by an absolute gain of 3.4% averaged over eight domains and 38 sub-domains. AIN's superior capabilities position it as a significant step toward empowering Arabic speakers with advanced multimodal generative AI tools across diverse applications."

The survey, as shown in Figure 6, covers various real-world domains, including medical diagnosis, road signs, and other scenarios such as low-resolution settings. Targeted at Arabic native speakers, it consists of 10 questions evaluating range of topics, each with corresponding ground-truth answers. Participants are tasked with selecting the response from the three models that they believe are closest to the ground-truth. In the survey, Model 1 represented AIN-7B (ours), Model 2 corresponds to GPT-4o [3], and Model 3 is LLaVA [11]. Delivered in MSA, the survey also includes an additional question to gather feedback on language clarity, MSA/ dialect preferences, and the survey itself. Survey Participation. More than 200 participants from 17 Arab countries (Figure 7), selected from diverse sectors and educational background, completed the survey. The highest contributions came from Saudi Arabia (30%), followed by Egypt (25%), the UAE (13.3%), and Lebanon (13.3%). Model Preferences. Figure 8 shows that participants predominantly favor Model 1 (AIN-7B (ours)), which received 76% of the votes. GPT-4v followed with 15%, and LLaVA garnered 9%, underscoring AINs significant preference among respondents (Figure 8). 6 Figure 6: AIN human evaluation survey, illustrating assessment criteria and multi-domain questions designed to evaluate multi-task and complex reasoning capabilities. The survey includes evaluations on specific food items, road signs in low-resolution settings, celebrities, charts, remote sensing tasks, and other diverse topics to comprehensively assess performance across multiple domains and challenges. 7 Figure 7: Nationality of AIN Survey Participants: Participants represent 17 Arab nations, with the highest contributions from Saudi Arabia (30%), followed by Egypt (25%), the UAE (13.3%), and Lebanon (13.3%). Figure 8: User Model Preferences. Participant preferences for the three models in the survey, with Model 1 (AIN (ours)) receiving 76% of the votes, GPT-4v 15%, and LLaVA 9%, demonstrating AINs strong performance. Survey Results and Analysis. The survey results reveal that AIN outperforms human participants in several questions, demonstrating notable advantages in accuracy and adherence to response formats. For instance, in Q1, although both Model 3 and human participants provided correct answers, they failed to comply with the required response format, criterion that AIN successfully fulfilled. Similarly, in Q9, 24.9% of participants, and in Q6, 20.5%, were unable to respond appropriately, whereas AIN provides accurate responses. In Q2, AIN exhibits superior precision by correctly identifying the shape as disc rather than circle, outperforming 18.6% of human respondents. Furthermore, in Q3 and Q5, participants struggle to recognize small details in the images, highlighting AINs ability to detect subtle features. Notably, in Q10, AIN demonstrates its capacity to solve complex reasoning tasks by extracting value beyond the visible content of the image. This highlights its ability to handle abstract problem-solving, further showcasing its comparative advantage over other models. Detailed results and comparative analyses are illustrated in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Dialect Preferences. Regarding language suitability, depicted in Figure 9, 74.3% of participants found MSA appropriate for the survey. An additional 11% were comfortable with MSA but expressed preference for their local dialect. Only 4.3% strongly preferred their local dialect over MSA, while 10.5% reported challenges unrelated to language. Figure 9: User Preferences for MSA and Local Dialects: The majority (74.3%) preferred MSA for reading and writing. An additional 11% are comfortable with MSA but favored their local dialects, while 4.3% found MSA challenging and prefer using their dialect. further 10.5% reported difficulties unrelated to linguistic aspects."

The results indicate that GPT-4o and GPT-4omini perform closely in speed and accuracy across both prompt types, with the Arabic prompt outperforming in both metrics. Notably, GPT-4o-mini achieves the highest accuracy with the Arabic prompt. Contributors generally found that GPT-4o-mini successfully translates all terms, including brand names such as Boeing, whereas GPT-4o frequently fails to provide complete or accurate translations for these sentences. Based on these findings, GPT-4o-mini is selected for data translation. All reading and results are recorded in Table 4 and Table 5 for Arabic and English prompts, respectively."

Figure 14a presents heatmap of the similarity scores of the models in evaluating translations semantic correctness, considering punctuation, tone, and diacritics. While high similarity scores indicate good performance, robust model must also assign low scores to poor or irrelevant translations. To assess this, second experiment tested model behavior on mismatched translations ( Figure 14b). Due to the close performance observed between LaBSE [29] and Paraphrase-XLM-R [27] in initial evaluations, an additional experiment is conducted to further assess their capabilities. This experiment utilized 50 samples of high-quality translations and 50 samples of moderate-to-poor translations. LaBSE demonstrated superior consistency, providing higher similarity scores for accurate translations and relatively lower scores for poor translations compared to Paraphrase-XLM-R.

Translations scoring below 80% similarity were excluded, accounting for less than 2% of the data. Figure 13: Data verification and filtering pipeline for textual and visual data. Textual data underwent semantic similarity checks using LaBSE [29] (80% threshold) and quality evaluation using BLEU [31] (60% threshold), METEOR [32] (80% threshold), and ROUGE [33] (80% threshold). Visual data was screened for toxicity using LLavaGuard [34] policies with GPT-4o [3], discarding unsafe images to ensure quality and safety. Data Quality Verification. To ensure comprehensive quality verification process, particularly given the use of Gen-AI for translation, additional checks are necessary. These include assessing the quality of machine-generated text, its correlation with the original content, and the degree of overlap between the generated and original text. To achieve this, we employ three specialized evaluation metrics: BLEU (2-gram and 4-gram) [31] for text quality, METEOR [32] for translation correlation, and ROUGE (unigram and ROUGE-L) [33] for overlap measurement. Our data quality verification experiment involves analyzing randomly selected 50 translated samples that are translated back to English using GPT-4o-mini [4] for comparison against the original English text (reference data). The evaluation metrics demonstrated strong performance across multiple dimensions: BLEU scores [31] of 71.11% (2-gram) and 60.20% (4-gram) indicated high local coherence and good fluency in the translated text. The METEOR score [32] of 86.10% suggested high-quality translation with effective handling of both exact matches and linguistic variations. ROUGE metrics [33] were particularly strong, with unigram scores showing 87.80% precision and 87.30% recall, indicating excellent 14 (a) Similarity scores for different settings for correct translation. The higher the better. (b) Similarity scores for different settings for incorrect translation. The lower the worse. Figure 14: Similarity scores for diverse settings, including direct correct translation, incorrect translation, semantic translation, diacritics, and punctuation. word-level accuracy and comprehensive content capture. Similarly, ROUGE-L scores [33] (precision: 86.20%, recall: 85.90%, F1: 85.80%) confirmed strong structural similarity between the translated and reference texts, demonstrating that the essential meaning and structure are well-preserved throughout the translation process. With the data translation quality checks completed, final step of visual toxicity inspection is required to ensure the data is ready for model training.

For fine-tuning, we employed full-parameter fine-tuning strategy, conducting training for one epoch. This approach allowed us to adapt the pre-trained model to better capture the semantic properties of both Arabic and English languages. To optimize training efficiency and scalability, we employ the flash-attention mechanism, which significantly reduces memory overhead during attention computation.
