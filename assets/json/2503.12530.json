            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The growing field of natural language processing (NLP) has found particular interest in the public eye in recent years, with the availability of large language models (LLMs) rapidly increasing. Often, these models use variations of the transformer architecture, which has drastically improved both the accuracy and speed of NLP tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), and represents one of the largest steps into the future of computing and machine learning. The fundamental starting point for NLP, however, is not based on computers or machine learning. NLP was started by the generation of natural languages by humans. This fundamental property of NLP leads to number of notable implications about the relations between large language models and humans, with this paper specifically focusing on the psychological relationship. The interest arising from the notion that if model is trained to generate text based 1 on human generated text, it may be expected that part of what the model is learning is the same underlying neurological or psychological behaviors exhibited by the humans. These behaviors could may even include abstract concepts in humans, like logical reasoning or object categorization, with object categorization being the behavior of interest in this work. Here, we examine psychological phenomenon known as basic-level categorization (Rosch et al., 1976) which has number of beneficial properties associated with it. This phenomenon will be examined more in the background section. briefly, it has utility in communication because of elevated level of category differentiation and information density. The fundamental question being addressed in this paper is whether basic-level categorization behaviors transfer to large language models. The first step towards addressing this question is an examination of LLM behavior to determine what alignment, if any, exists with LLMs and human categorization. This paper attempts to investigate that alignment in number of ways associated with the basic level in humans. This paper evaluates two recent vision language models (VLMs) for human-like visual categorization behaviors. Specificaly, in this paper, we show that: VLMs tend to prefer categorization at the basic-level when prompted without expert bias. There is notable distinction in VLM basiclevel categorization frequency between biological and non biological objects, consistent with known human categorization behavior. VLMs exhibit the same directional shifting in basic-level usage frequency when prompted with expertise that has been shown in human experts."

            "title": "2 Background",
            "content": "This section gives an overview of the elements of basic categorization that exist in the psychological literature and are examined in our experiments. 2.1 Basic-Level Effect The basic level is an emergent categorization level that appears in the many hierarchies humans use to distinguish things from one another (Rosch et al., 1976). This level is the most commonly used category when compared to both the less specific categories in our hierarchies (superordinate) and the more specific categories (subordinate). For example, when shown an image of dog, person will be more likely to describe it as \"dog\" than as either an \"animal\" (superordinate) or by its specific breed (subordinate). One very commonly accepted explanation in the psychological field for why humans would have developed to use the basic level disproportionately, as opposed to uniform categorization distribution, is that the basic categories have higher information density and category differentiation (Tanaka and Taylor, 1991; Rosch et al., 1976), permitting faster, more accurate, and more utilitarian categorization. There are other recognized properties that occur when the basic level is invoked. These include being the most abstract level at which visual identification of stimuli can be aided by priming (Rosch et al., 1976), children being able to sort basic objects taxonomically at ages where other visual stimuli would fail to be categorized (Rosch et al., 1976), being the most frequently used categories in Common English (Rosch et al., 1976; Mehrer et al., 2021), and labels at this level being applied faster in visual stimuli (Rosch et al., 1976; Tanaka and Taylor, 1991). These properties provide clear benefits to human cognition, and are reasonably explained by the higher information density and category differentiation the basic level exhibits. We do not address but believe that similar improvements may exist in LLMs when operating at the basic level. We leave this question for future work and focus on the existence of basic level effects in VLMs."

            "title": "2.2 Biological vs. Non-Biological",
            "content": "The basic level also has notable distinction in the cognitive science literature between biological and non-biological objects. The distinction is that biological things seem to be associated with each other based on their features, such as fangs, claws, or legs, while non-biological things tend to be associated with each other based on attributes associated with function (Rosch et al., 1976). The strength of this difference is hard to quantify due to the different ways in which the distinction between biological and non-biological things can be defined. However, existing evidence has indicated that non-biological things have higher tendency to be described with subordinate category than the biological categories (Rosch et al., 1976). 2.3 Expert basic-level Shift The cognitive science literature also suggests that expertise changes the expression of basic level effects. It has been shown that the highest information density for an expert tends to be below the typical basic level for subject matter non-experts (Tanaka and Taylor, 1991). This suggests that the basic level has shifted lower to match the more granular understanding experts have within their domain. For the sake of clarity, when referring to this subordinate shifted basic level, it is called the expert-shifted-basic level, and any usage of the phrase \"basic level\" not specified refers to the basic level observed in non-experts."

            "content": "Many studies have investigated human-like cognitive effects in LLMs. Of particular relevance are those that study human-like behaviors related to categorization in language models (Misra et al., 2021; Roberts et al., 2024b; Vemuri et al., 2024; Roberts et al., 2024a). The existing works examine patterns in human categorization such as the fan and typicality effects, and their applicability to LLM categorization. Papers on the typicality effect generally find that typicality effects present themselves in LLMs, but tend to present themselves much stronger in combined vision and text input models than in only vision or only text based models (Misra et al., 2021; Vemuri et al., 2024). The literature on the fan effect demonstrates that the recall uncertainty for an object demonstrated by model is in part accounted for by the fan effect (Roberts et al., 2024a). The fact that these cognitive effects, first established in human categorization, have been found in LLMs promises other effects are likely present as well. Despite this, no existing literature for the basic level could be found regarding LLMs or VLMs."

            "title": "3 Methods",
            "content": "The methodology for this paper is twofold. The first step is to prompt our models with an image alongside prompt. dataset is used that pairs images with basic level descriptions. The model is prompted with the image and the returned description is compared with the basic level descriptions available in the dataset. 3.1 Dataset Description The dataset of images used for categorization comes from an organization called KietzmannLab, specifically their Ecoset dataset (Mehrer et al., 2021). This is dataset of about 1.5 million images all falling into one of 565 basic categories, with the basic categories determined based on frequency of use by the original author. The categorizations were manually curated by humans. The KietzmannLab group started with larger number of basic categories then used human observers to rank categories based on how \"concrete\" they were. They then dropped categories that were ranked below certain concreteness ranking, thus getting rid of the more abstract categories. Since we are using vision language models, some of the less concrete categories, like romance, are unlikely to have been in the models training set. This makes it more difficult to interpret results, because the more abstract hierarchies but dont necessarily manifest physically. If this causes difficulty in categorizing images in the abstract categories, it would be difficult to know if that is because the models fail to find utility in the category, or if it is because the models do not have robust representation that can]map to an agreed-upon abstract hierarchy. Thus, the concreteness rankings are useful for the goals of this study. The entire dataset was not used. Rather, the dataset was sampled due to limited compute power and time. The Python random library was employed to remove images from the dataset until 50 images remained for each of the categories. The total set of used images contains 28,250. The categories include both biological (e.g., acorn, antelope, anteater and non-biological categories (e.g., airplane, anchor, balloon in accordance with the design of extant research into human cognition (Rosch et al., 1976). It is worth noting that the basic-level image dataset contains some noisy labels which are likely due to the curation process. As an example, the Figure 1: Incorrectly Labeled Image image in Figure 1 is labeled by KietzmannLab as an image of banana, however it appears to be photo of child standing in front of what seems to be banana tree. Such errors are relatively rare. sample of 530 images was checked and failed to present any other clear examples of categorization errors. However, it should still be noted that these errors exist in the dataset."

This prompt, found in figure 2, is intentionally simple to avoid introducing bias into the output token probability distribution while also constraining the output length. The intuition behind prompting for minimal-length output is to illicit the more informationally dense description. Without the minimal-length constraint, the models often produce verbose object descriptions, burying the basiclevel category deep within the explanation. This behavior may also obscure preference for basic-level 3 categories. When this occurs, no clear basic level preference was observed. An example response with this error is as follows: pert prompting often forces the consumption of number of available output tokens. The following is an example output over an image of an anchor: \"The object in the image is an Air Canada passenger plane. The plane is white with red lettering that says Air Canada and red maple leaf on the tail. It is on the runway, with its engines running and its wheels still on the ground. The plane is facing to the right\" In this example, the first categorization of the plane is subordinate category of \"passenger plane\", but the broader category of plane is used more often. In this case, no clear category preference is discernible with our word matching methodology. The following is an example of minimality prompted example with no category ambiguity: \"An airplane on runway\" hard cap of 30 tokens is also introduced for performance reasons although, with the minimality prompting, the limit is rarely reached."

This prompting method is meant to test whether or not the tested models, prompted to act in character as an expert, would use basic-level categories at lower rate. This would be strong indication as to whether the model experiences the expertise effect and changes its categorization preferences to the expert-shifted-basic level. For this test, the max output token count is left at 30 so as to not impact the results, however it should be noted that the ex4 \"Marinier. am Marinier. The main subject in this image is black anchor with yellow rope\" The prompt asks for the word for expertise to be said twice instead of just telling the model it is an expert. The reason for this is that transformer models attends to each generated output token at each inference step (Vaswani et al., 2017). The point being that if the expertise effect on human basic-level categorization affects the model, then token(s) associated with the domain-specific term for expertise would have vector representation with higher similarity to the subordinate categories than the generic term \"expert\". So the goal is to see if the model can be primed towards the subordinate categories. This follows similar process in the psychological literature on basic categorization for priming human subjects for image categorization by saying the basic category immediately before an image is shown (Rosch et al., 1976). The expected result will be decrease in the experts categorization frequency at the basic level when compared to the initial categorizations."

To test the statistical significance of the shift in the measured proportions, two proportion Z-test is employed. The two proportion Z-test can be used to determine the level of confidence that sampled proportion differs between populations. This measure is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference in basic level usage as proportion between both the biological and non-biological samples, and the non-expert and expert samples. This is required to justify the main claims in this paper regarding VLM biological/non-biological categorization and expert/non-expert claims with statistical measure of significance. The assumptions of the test are that the test statistic, the average number of successes in the trial, is normally distributed. This is an accurate assumption in large sample due to the central value theorem for Bernoulli trials."

Since the determination of basic categories can be done by identifying set of categories that are used most frequently (Rosch et al., 1976; Tanaka and Taylor, 1991), the basic-level categories are understood to be the most frequently applied category from the dataset for given object. This means that lower bound estimate of basic level category usage can be defined at 50%. If both the models use the basic level at above rate of 0.5, then they have basic category usage frequency above the lower bound suggested by the literature. Therefore, basic level categorization rate above the baseline is strong indication that the human preference for the basic level is exhibited by the tested models."

The results is 15,380 outputs at the basic level and 12,870 at either subordinate or superordinate levels for the Llama model. 54% of the outputs contain the basic level for the Llama model, with the Molmo model having 49%. This represents an approximately 5.8% drop from the percentage of basic level categorization that occurred from the initial non-expert prompt in the Llama model and 3% drop in the Molmo model, with both having value of less than 0.01. two proportion Z-test was performed between the normal and expert prompting categorization results for each model, with resulting test statistics of approximately 77 and 17 for the Llama and Molmo respectively, with all of these results shown in table 3. This definitively demonstrates that the expertise effect noted in previous work on human subjects transfers to the tested models (Tanaka and Taylor, 1991). Expert humans and models tend to use the basic level less than their non-expert counterparts.

On our LLM testing, Molmo decreased the difference, while Llama increased it. The biological and non-biological difference is also measured with the expert prompt, with basiclevel categorization percentages of 61% and 51% respectively, for the Llama model. The same ztest performed between the the biological and nonbiological initial prompt is applied for the expert prompt, with significant results found in table 4. The difference between the two is notably larger than the difference between the initial prompting biological and non-biological differences, which is result that is not consistently predicted by previous work, but is suggested by Johnson and Mervis (1997). Interestingly, we find contradictory results. While Llama showed an increase in the biological versus non-biological dichotomy, Molmo had respective test statistic of only 9, which suggests that expert prompting mitigated, rather than exacerbated, the effect."

            "content": "We find that vision language models exhibit preference for basic-level categories consistent with humans when labeling visual stimuli. There is also sufficient evidence to demonstrate alignment with the specific psychological behavior associated with the biological/non-biological category dichotomy supported in the literature (Murphy and Brownell, 1985). This can be seen in the decreased basic category usage found in table 2. This study also finds that the expertise effect on the basic category exists within our models, specifically the associated drop in usage of the basic category when models were prompted to act as experts, as shown in table 3. There was particular overlap with this effect and the size of the difference between the biological and non-biological categories in both models, although with the directions reversed between models. This can be seen in table 4. This corresponds with discussions of this overlap in similar effects in Vemuri et al. (2024), although the exact behavior was not precisely characterized. 5.1 Connections the Field of Psychological The results achieved in this study are consistent with the human psychological research on basic category usage in humans(Rosch et al., 1976). The primary findings in this study further the cognitive understanding of LLMs and provide directions for future work regarding basic level representation advantages in LLM and VLM tasks. Further, they will hopefully prove useful to the psychological field as means to deeper analysis of model with cognition related to that of human. 5."

There are other methods to determine basic-level categories (Rosch et al., 1976), and it is plausible that the use of word frequency as the determinant of the basic category impacts vision language model behavior. Additionally, while the Llama and Molmo tended to exhibit basic level behavior,it may be that other models would not. This possibility suggests ongoing testing on multitude of vision language models and an analysis of the constituent parts of 6 each, given their modular nature. In particular the embeddings, pre-training task, and data should be examined to understand the relationship to categorization behavior. It has been found that large language models generate outputs that do not align with human preferences (Stiennon et al., 2020), but that models trained on data that had been ranked on preference by human judges, tend to align better with human preferences. It seems plausible that that one factor human judges may take into account, consciously or otherwise, is the level of categorization (Sonnenwald, 1999). Therefore, it is plausible that RLHF tuned models may have heightened basic level preference."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "Our experiments demonstrate the propensity of VLMs towards basic categories consistent with that observed in humans. They also consistent with the unique impact of biological versus nonbiological categories on human basic level categorization (Rosch et al., 1976). Similarly, VLMs who are instructed to act as experts use the basic-level less frequently just as their human counterparts do (Tanaka and Taylor, 1991). The results show that VLMs acquire nuanced categorization behaviors that are consistent with basic level effects in humans. The findings in this paper should be useful stepping stone for driving toward more understandable and easily interpreted language models, with focus on the categorizations that are most beneficial for human machine interfacing. There is room in the future to explore the implications about both the behavior of the models as holding representations of emergent features of human cognition, and trying to find models architectures that are more easily domain adaptable due to well suited basic level representations. By exploring the middle ground between human and language model cognition, this work will hopefully be contributive tool for the growing role artificial intelligence plays in enhancing the capabilities of individuals. By working towards an alignment of human communication and LLM cognition, we believe AI will become more accessible and impactful."
