            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Embedding models are central to modern NLP systems, powering applications such as search, recommendation, semantic analysis, and information retrieval. Many benchmarks test the performance of embedding models, with the most comprehensive offering diverse suite of tasks that test their generality and robustness (Muennighoff et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2025; Enevoldsen et al., 2025). Despite these advances, the interpretation and quality of these scores are often unclear as it is absent of human performance references. Current metrics define performance in terms of theoretical maxima (e.g., MAP = 1.0) that assume perfect consensus on task outcomes. However, many NLP tasks inherently involve ambiguity and disagreement (Plank, 2022), making models score difficult to meaningfully interpret without reasonable references. For instance, if model achieves 0.85 MAP in reranking, it is unclear whether this should be considered strong, mediocre, or beyond what annotators typically achieve. This disconnect highlights the need for human-centered evaluation that contextualizes benchmark results. To address this, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation framework for text embedding tasks. HUME evaluates annotator performance across four task categories: reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity (STS), using 16 diverse datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (Muennighoff et al., 2022), adapted for human annotation feasibility. Through multi-annotator experiments, we analyze task difficulty, quantify variation across humans, and compare results directly against state-of-the-art embedding models. Our contributions are threefold: (1) generalizable framework for human evaluation of embedding tasks, (2) empirical evidence of how humans perform across diverse datasets and task types, and (3) comparative analysis of models and humans that highlights strengths, weaknesses, and ambiguities in both benchmarks and models that yield actionable insights. Together, these contributions establish foundation for human-aligned evaluation of embedding models and guide future benchmark design."

            "title": "2 RELATED WORK",
            "content": "2.1 TEXT EMBEDDING MODELS AND MTEB Text embedding models map natural language into dense vectors that capture semantic information. They have progressed from static embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) to contextual encoders (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) and more recently to models optimized for embeddings like Sentence-BERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), E5 (Wang et al., 2022), and GTE (Li et al., 2023), powering applications such as search, classification, and clustering. To evaluate these models across its diverse use-cases, MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2022; Enevoldsen et al., 2025) has risen as the de facto benchmark framework for embeddings and consolidates evaluation across diverse tasks and datasets. Despite its breadth and community-driven extensions spanning multilingual, multimodal, and domain-specific variants (Xiao et al., 2025; Kasmaee et al., 2025; Tang & Yang, 2025; Xiao et al., 2024; Ciancone et al., 2024; Enevoldsen et al., 2024; Zinvandi et al., 2025; Wehrli et al., 2024; Poswiata et al., 2024; Snegirev et al., 2024), MTEB lacks human performance baselines, making it difficult to contextualize model achievements. 2.2 HUMAN EVALUATION IN NLP Human evaluation is well established in NLP, especially for generative tasks like machine translation (Graham et al., 2013), summarization (Fabbri et al., 2021), and dialogue (Gupta et al., 2019). In contrast, embedding-based tasks have relied almost exclusively on automated metrics, with little attention to human baselines. In information retrieval, initiatives such as TREC (Voorhees & Tice, 2000) collect human relevance judgments, but these serve as gold standards rather than benchmarks of human performance under model metrics (e.g., nDCG, MRR). Similarly, GLUE, SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2018; 2019), and MERA (Fenogenova et al., 2024) Russian GLUE-like benchmark report human baselines, but mainly for classification and reasoning tasks. For embeddings, works like STS (Cer et al., 2017) report inter-annotator agreement, yet these are not converted into model-comparable performance 2 scores. This leaves gap: human performance on embedding benchmarks such as MTEB remains largely unquantified."

            "content": "Our selection criteria ensures comprehensive coverage across multiple dimensions: (1) linguistic diversity: including both high-resource languages (English, Arabic, Russian) and lower-resource languages (Norwegian Bokmål, Danish) 1 to test cross-lingual generalization, (2) domain variety: spanning news, social media, encyclopedic content, scientific literature, and forum discussions to capture real-world application diversity, (3) construction methods: including both curated human annotations and synthetic dataset creation to understand how dataset origin affects humanmodel alignment, (4) task relevance: using tasks from established benchmarks widely adopted in the embedding evaluation community, and (5) task complexity variation: ranging from binary classification to fine-grained similarity judgments. This systematic selection ensures our findings generalize across the diverse landscape of embedding applications while maintaining direct relevance to existing evaluation frameworks. Each task category uses primary evaluation metric to enable consistent humanmodel comparisons. Table 1 summarizes the datasets, their domains, and the primary metrics applied. Detailed task examples are provided in Appendix B. 3.3 ANNOTATION PROCEDURE All annotations are conducted in Argilla (Argilla Project Contributors, 2025) using task-specific interfaces: binary relevance judgments for reranking, categorical labels for classification, free assignment of cluster IDs for clustering, and 05 similarity scores for STS. Sample sizes are balanced by task complexity: reranking uses 2049 queries per dataset, classification 4048 examples, clustering 30 items across clusters, and STS 3050 sentence pairs. All annotators were male, aged 2035, from culturally diverse backgrounds, and experienced NLP practitioners with native or near-native proficiency in the evaluated languages. They followed structured guidelines and completed all annotations independently, without access to ground truth or model predictions. The downsampled task subsets used for comparisons are included in the MTEB package, with detailed task examples provided in Appendix B. English tasks were annotated by two annotators to enable agreement analysis. Multilingual tasks were annotated by single annotator with corresponding language expertise. Inter-annotator agreement was assessed with task-appropriate metrics: Fleiss kappa (Fleiss, 1971) for classification, pairwise ARI (Strehl & Ghosh, 2003) for clustering, pairwise Spearman correlation (Agirre et al., 2012a) for STS, and mean Spearman/Kendalls tau (Manning et al., 2008) for reranking. detailed agreement analysis is provided in Appendix D. This controlled evaluation setup minimizes potential confounds from dataset variation and enables direct performance comparisons on identical evaluation instances. 3.4 MODEL SELECTION AND EVALUATION We evaluate 13 embedding models chosen to cover multiple dimensions: (1) parameter scale (22M7B), (2) architecture (encoderand decoder-based), (3) instruction tuning (instruction-tuned and standard), and (4) multilingual capability (English and multilingual).

            "content": "Figure 1 provides an overview of human performance relative to 13 state-of-the-art embedding models across 16 tasks. Human annotators rank 4th overall with score of 0.776, trailing 3 large models but outperforming 10 others. This positioning reveals that humans neither represent performance ceiling nor lower bound, but rather occupy middle ground that varies significantly by task category and language. Table 2 presents the aggregated human results compared to selected models in various sizes. Below we analyze each category and language group in the following sections and refer to Appendix for the full results on specific task categories. 4.1 PERFORMANCE PATTERNS BY TASK CATEGORY Figure 2 shows human performance relative to model performance ranges across all 26 task-language pairs. Each task shows human performance (point) positioned within the full spectrum from worst to best model performance (range bars). Humans consistently perform in the upper portion of model ranges, typically exceeding median model performance (61.5% of tasks) while rarely matching the best models (15.4% of tasks). Classification tasks show the strongest human performance, with humans outperforming all models in 3 of 7 tasks, while clustering and reranking reveal consistent gaps where humans fall short of top-performing models.

Bold indicates highest performance (human or model), underline indicates best model performance. Humans achieve top performance in 5 of 14 aggregated task-language pairs, particularly excelling in non-English sentiment analysis and Arabic semantic similarity. Overall results are aggregated over the 26 task-language pairs. Classification: Human performance averages 70.3 across classification tasks, with substantial variation reflecting task-specific challenges. Performance ranges from 45.8 on emotion classification (κ = 0.39, fair agreement) to 95.0 on Arabic sentiment analysis. Models generally exceed human performance, with the best achieving 87.1 on English tasks. However, humans outperform models on non-English sentiment analysis, particularly in Arabic (95.0 vs. 77.5) and Russian (92.5 vs. 81.2), likely benefiting from native cultural and linguistic understanding that current models fail to capture. Clustering Clustering presents the greatest challenge for humans, averaging 67.4 V-measure with extreme variation. Near-perfect performance on WikiCities (97.6, ARI = 0.91) contrasts sharply with poor performance on ArXiv papers (49.2, ARI = 0.001), which uses derived labels from ArXiv categories. Models consistently outperform humans, with the best reaching 85.1%. The poor inter-annotator agreement on academic clustering indicates fundamental task ambiguity rather than human limitation. Reranking: Humans achieve strong performance in reranking (87.2 average MAP), demonstrating intuitive document relevance understanding. Models exceed human performance (best: 96.4), but humans maintain competitive scores with high inter-annotator agreement (ρ = 0.64-0.85), suggesting these tasks align well with human judgment. STS: Human performance averages 83.2 Spearman correlation, with notable dataset-specific variation. STS12 achieves 91.2 while STS22-Russian drops to 58.7, likely reflecting dataset quality issues discussed in 4.3. Models achieve comparable performance (best: 88.5), with moderate interannotator agreement (ρ = 0.58-0.77). These results reveal critical insight that challenges conventional evaluation paradigms: human performance variation often reflects task quality rather than human limitations. Tasks with high human performance and agreement (reranking, toxicity classification) represent well-specified problems with clear ground truth, while tasks with low human agreement (emotion classification, academic clustering) may suffer from ambiguous annotation guidelines or inherently subjective judgments. Models achieve superhuman performance by reproducing consistent label patterns from training data, but this consistency may mask fundamental issues with task specification. Rather than treating low human performance as ceiling to surpass, our findings suggest that it often signals the need for improved task design and clearer annotation frameworks. 5 Figure 2: Comprehensive view of human performance relative to all model performance ranges across 16 tasks by language. 4.2 CROSS-LINGUAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS Arabic exhibits the strongest human advantage: 67% win rate against the best models and 100% against the mean, with the largest gap in semantic similarity (67.5% vs. 40.9%, 26.6-point margin). Russian and Norwegian also show consistent human superiority in sentiment analysis, where humans achieve 92.5% and 85.0%, respectively, substantially outperforming the best models. These advantages likely stem from cultural and contextual knowledge that models fail to capture, especially in lower-resource languages. English tasks are more balanced, with models generally matching or exceeding humans, reflecting the languages dominance in training data. Danish shows mixed outcomes, possibly due to stronger multilingual coverage for Germanic languages. 4.3 DATASET QUALITY AND EVALUATION CHALLENGES Our analysis reveals systematic quality issues in several MTEB datasets that fundamentally compromise their reliability as evaluation benchmarks. Human performance variation often correlates with underlying ambiguity rather than genuine human limitations, providing diagnostic tool for identifying problematic evaluation targets. Below we highlight two such examples: Emotion Classification Ambiguity: The emotion classification dataset exemplifies inherent labeling ambiguity, achieving only fair inter-annotator agreement (κ = 0.39) with 52.1% consensus. Real examples demonstrate the fundamental challenges: feel like such noob when the customers make really dull and stupid jokes that im supposed to find funny could reasonably be labeled as sadness (0), anger (3), or even surprise (5) depending on interpretation. Similarly, am feeling very indecisive and spontaneous contains mixed emotional states that resist single-label categorization. Sarcastic expressions like got paid too much because get so many deliveries at work Im feeling bit shamed present surface emotions that differ from intended meaning. When human experts fundamentally disagree on correct answers for such inherently ambiguous cases, the apparent superhuman model 6 Figure 3: Human win rates across task categories and languages. Top left: By task category shows humans perform moderately in classification but struggle in clustering, reranking, and STS against best models. Top right: English-only vs multilingual tasks reveals humans perform better on multilingual tasks (29% vs 0% against best models). Bottom left: Performance varies dramatically by baseline comparison (15% vs best, 62% vs mean models). Bottom right: Language-specific breakdown shows varying performance across different language codes. performance (87.1% vs. 45.8% human) likely reflects consistent reproduction of arbitrary majority label patterns rather than superior emotional understanding. ArXiv Clustering Breakdown: Academic paper clustering shows complete breakdown of human agreement (ARI=-0.001), indicating fundamental disagreement about how to categorize academic papers. Real examples illustrate the core ambiguity: papers like Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Representation Learning with Relaxed Cross-Modal Synchronicity could legitimately cluster with computer vision, machine learning, or audio processing groups depending on the annotators perspective on primary methodology versus application domain. The architecture of innovation: Tracking face-to-face interactions with ubicomp technologies spans social science, computer science, and architecture domains. Such interdisciplinary papers create fundamental disagreement about correct clustering approaches, with no objectively correct answer. The task uses derived labels from ArXiv categories, but the core issue is that academic papers often span multiple domains, making any single clustering scheme inherently ambiguous. The high model performance (84.6% vs. 49.2% human) suggests that the models are reproducing consistent labeling patterns rather than solving the fundamental categorization challenge. High-Quality Benchmark Identification: Conversely, tasks with high human agreement provide reliable evaluation targets. Reranking tasks achieve strong inter-annotator agreement (ρ = 0.640.85) with clear performance targets, while toxicity classification shows moderate agreement (κ = 0.55) with 77.8% annotator consensus. These represent genuine evaluation challenges where model improvements likely reflect meaningful progress rather than pattern matching to flawed labels. These patterns suggest that apparent superhuman model performance often occurs precisely where human agreement is lowest, indicating that models excel not through superior understanding but through consistent reproduction of systematic labeling patterns. This raises concerns about the label 7 quality in embeddings benchmarks, and we encourage future benchmark developers to critically examine the datasets before including them in benchmark, potentially using human annotations framework like HUME. Detailed analysis of specific quality issues is provided in Appendix C."

            "title": "5.1 TASK QUALITY AND EMBEDDING EVALUATION RELIABILITY",
            "content": "Models achieve their highest relative performance precisely where human experts show the least agreement. This striking pattern raises fundamental questions about what constitutes reliable evaluation in embedding benchmarks. Tasks with high human agreement, such as reranking (ρ = 0.640.85) and toxicity classification (κ = 0.55), provide reliable evaluation targets, while low-agreement tasks like emotion classification (κ = 0.39) and ArXiv clustering (ARI = 0.001) suffer from ambiguous guidelines or subjective judgments. While some cases involve clear quality issues, the mechanisms behind this inverse relationship remain unclear. Models may excel through superior semantic understanding or by exploiting systematic annotation patterns. Cultural factors further complicate evaluation. Humans retain substantial advantages in Arabic semantic similarity (67.5% vs. 40.9% best model) and multilingual sentiment analysis, revealing genuine model limitations in cross-cultural understanding. These findings suggest reliable evaluation depends as much on task quality as model capability. Rather than automatically treating high model performance as progress, we recommend prioritizing high-agreement tasks for model and benchmark development, addressing cultural competence gaps, and critically examining whether apparent model superiority on ambiguous tasks reflects genuine capabilities or systematic biases in evaluation datasets. 5.2 IMPLICATIONS FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION PRACTICES Our findings reveal concrete directions for both embedding model development and evaluation methodology that address the fundamental quality issues weve identified. Prioritize High-Agreement Tasks for Development: Development efforts should focus on tasks where humans demonstrate both high performance and agreement, as these provide the most reliable benchmarks for measuring genuine progress. Reranking tasks, with their clear performance targets and strong agreement (ρ = 0.64 0.85), offer dependable evaluation where the persistent modelhuman gap (96.4% vs. 87.2%) represents meaningful challenges requiring better modeling of relevance relationships. Toxicity classification, despite moderate agreement (κ = 0.55), provides another reliable target with 77.8% human consensus. In contrast, optimizing for tasks with poor human agreement (emotion classification κ = 0.39, ArXiv clustering ARI = 0.001) may lead models to excel at reproducing arbitrary labeling patterns rather than developing genuine semantic capabilities. Address Cultural and Linguistic Competence Gaps: The substantial human advantages in nonEnglish tasks reveal critical model limitations that scaling training data alone cannot address. Arabic semantic similarity shows the largest human advantage (67.5% vs. 40.9% best model), while multilingual sentiment analysis demonstrates consistent human superiority in non-English languages (95.0% Arabic, 92.5% Russian). These gaps suggest that current models lack the cultural and contextual knowledge necessary for cross-lingual understanding, requiring architectural innovations or training approaches that go beyond simple data scaling to capture cultural nuances and contextual understanding. Replace Problematic Benchmark Datasets: Our analysis identifies specific datasets that compromise benchmark reliability and should be replaced in future MTEB iterations: emotion classification (κ = 0.39), ArXiv clustering (ARI = 0.001), and STS22-Russian (systematic parsing artifacts). These tasks provide unreliable evaluation targets that may mislead model development efforts by rewarding pattern matching to flawed gold standards. Replacement datasets should demonstrate reasonable human agreement and clear task specifications, validated through human evaluation studies before inclusion in benchmark suites. 8 Develop Culturally-Aware Evaluation Frameworks: Current benchmarks may underestimate cross-cultural understanding challenges by focusing on tasks where models can leverage Englishcentric training advantages. The pronounced human advantages in Arabic and other non-English tasks demonstrate the need for evaluation frameworks that properly assess cultural and contextual understanding. Future benchmarks should include more diverse cultural contexts and ensure that high model performance reflects genuine cross-cultural competence rather than exploitation of training data biases. Consider Agreement-Weighted Evaluation: Model performance should be interpreted in light of human agreement levels, with evaluation practices adapted accordingly. We propose reporting model performance alongside human agreement metrics to provide proper interpretive context. model achieving 85% accuracy on emotion classification (185% of human performance, κ = 0.39) represents fundamentally different achievement than 85% on reranking (97% of human performance, ρ = 0.75). High model performance on low-agreement tasks should be viewed skeptically as potential artifacts of flawed evaluation targets rather than genuine capability improvements."

            "title": "5.3 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS",
            "content": "Our study has several limitations. First, while three annotators participated overall, only two annotations were collected for most tasks, constraining our ability to fully characterize human judgment distributions. Sample sizes (2050 instances per task) balance feasibility and reliability but may not capture the full complexity of human performance variation. Additionally, annotators were average or above-average raters without specialized training; expert annotators could perform better, particularly on technical tasks like academic clustering. However, we believe that the samples provided clearly show that decisions on evaluation datasets can be made from even few samples. Future work should expand annotator pools to better capture human judgment variability and extend evaluations to additional MTEB task categories. Crucially, the field needs rigorous research on designing tasks that balance clear specification with meaningful challenge, avoiding both ambiguity, which depresses human agreement, and oversimplification, which diminishes the evaluations ability to discriminate model capabilities. Finally, embedding evaluation should aim not for model superhuman performance but for frameworks that reliably distinguish genuine semantic understanding from sophisticated pattern matching. Achieving this requires careful attention to task quality, human agreement, and the cultural contexts shaping language understanding."

            "content": "We introduce HUME, comprehensive human evaluation framework for MTEB, addressing critical gap in understanding empirical performance bounds for embedding models. By measuring human performance across 16 datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and STS, we establish baselines that reframe how model achievements should be interpreted. Our findings show that human performance varies substantially by task categories. Tasks with high agreement provide reliable benchmarks, while low-agreement tasks often indicate design issues rather than human limitations. Apparent model superhuman performance tends to coincide with low human agreement, suggesting models exploit patterns rather than achieving true semantic understanding. HUME provides both methodology and baseline measurements for evaluating embedding models. By releasing our resources and protocols, we aim to support the community in adopting humangrounded evaluation practices and developing models better aligned with human judgment and real-world language understanding."

Context Expansion Issues: Sentence pairs labeled as 4 (identical meaning) where one sentence contains basic information and the paired sentence includes additional backstory or context Translated example pattern: Company reports earnings vs. Company reports earnings of $X million, exceeding expectations due to strong performance in sector Human annotators correctly identify these as semantically different (similarity 2-3), while gold labels mark them as identical 18 This explains the low human performance on STS22-Russian (58.5%) compared to models (69.5%) Parsing and Processing Errors: Incomplete sentence parsing affecting semantic interpretation Parsing artifacts from web pages (e.g., page numbers, lists of automatically generated related news, ads) C.1.2 MULTILINGUAL SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION-RUSSIAN The Russian subset of MultilingualSentimentClassification consists of news articles from different news sites. The task is to classify each text as positive or negative. However, the dataset presents several challenges: Neutral and Ambiguous Content: Many samples are based on press releases from companies or government departments, which are often neutral in tone and difficult to categorize as positive or negative. Translated example: The total amount of pension savings accumulated in JSC Unified Accumulative Pension Fund (UAPF) as of September 1, 2016, amounted to about 6.41 trillion tenge, the press center of the pension fund said, KazTAG reports. ... Such sentences are more informative than sentiment-bearing. Parsing and Processing Errors: Similar to the issues described in C.1.1, the dataset contains parsing artifacts from web pages. C.1.3 EMOTION CLASSIFICATION The emotion classification dataset suffers from inherent label ambiguity that explains the low human agreement (κ = 0.39): Mixed Emotional States: Texts expressing multiple emotions simultaneously: am feeling very indecisive and spontaneous (labeled as fear but could be surprise) was feeling pretty anxious all day but my first day at work was very good day and that helped lot (contains both fear and joy) am feeling crampy and cranky (physical discomfort mixed with anger) Sarcastic and Ironic Expressions: got paid too much because get so many deliveries at work im feeling bit shamed so will curb the spending for bit (sarcasm about being overpaid) feel like such noob when the customers make really dull and stupid jokes that im supposed to find funny (surface sadness but underlying anger/frustration) feel very cheated since am supporting the family and doing all the other stuff while he spends hours day gaming (labeled as joy but clearly expressing anger) Contextual and Subjective Interpretation: feel shame in strange way (ambiguous emotional context, labeled as surprise) feel all funny sometimes (vague emotional description that could be multiple categories) feel underappreciated and under valued (could be sadness, anger, or fear depending on interpretation) C.1.4 ARXIV CLUSTERING CHALLENGES Academic paper clustering presents fundamental categorization difficulties that explain the complete breakdown of human agreement (ARI = 0.001). This task uses derived labels from ArXiv paper categories: Interdisciplinary Research Papers: Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Representation Learning with Relaxed Cross-Modal Synchronicity (could cluster with computer vision, audio processing, or self-supervised learning) The architecture of innovation: Tracking face-to-face interactions with ubicomp technologies (spans social science, computer science, and architecture) PIINET: 360-degree Panoramic Image Inpainting Network Using Cube Map (computer vision, graphics, or deep learning focus) Methodological vs. Application Domain Confusion: Convergent Actor-Critic Algorithms Under Off-Policy Training and Function Approximation (reinforcement learning methodology vs. control theory application) Learning-Based Adaptive IRS Control with Limited Feedback Codebooks (machine learning method vs. wireless communications application) Structure-preserving numerical methods for stochastic Poisson systems (numerical methods vs. mathematical physics) Emerging and Cross-Domain Research: The modularity of action and perception revisited using control theory and active inference (cognitive science, control theory, or neuroscience) Food-chain competition influences genes size (evolutionary biology, computational biology, or mathematical modeling) Wavelet Analysis of Dengue Incidence and its Correlation with Weather and Vegetation Variables in Costa Rica (epidemiology, signal processing, or environmental science) C.2 IMPACT ON EVALUATION These quality issues have several critical implications for embedding evaluation: 1. Artificial Model Advantages: Models may achieve superhuman performance by consistently reproducing systematic labeling patterns rather than demonstrating superior semantic understanding. This is particularly evident in tasks with low human agreement where models can exploit consistent but incorrect labeling patterns. 2. Misleading Benchmarks: Tasks with fundamental quality issues provide unreliable targets for model development. High model performance on such tasks may not indicate genuine capability improvements but rather successful pattern matching to flawed gold standards. 3. Cultural and Linguistic Bias: Quality issues disproportionately affect non-English tasks, potentially masking genuine model limitations in cross-cultural understanding while artificially inflating performance on problematic English datasets. 4. Evaluation Validity: The validity of using these datasets as benchmarks is questionable when human experts cannot agree on correct answers, suggesting fundamental issues with task specification rather than human limitations. INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT ANALYSIS D.1 AGREEMENT METRICS BY TASK CATEGORY This section provides detailed inter-annotator agreement analysis using task-appropriate metrics. Agreement levels follow standard guidelines: κ > 0.8 (excellent), 0.6 < κ 0.8 (substantial), 20 0.4 < κ 0.6 (moderate), 0.2 < κ 0.4 (fair), κ 0.2 (poor).

Humans achieve 61.5% win rate against median models, demonstrating competitive performance when compared to typical rather than best-performing models. This analysis reveals that human performance is much more competitive when compared against representative model performance rather than cherry-picked best results. 24 Figure 15: Task difficulty categorization based on human performance levels. The majority of tasks (69%) fall into the easy category (human performance 0.7), shown in green. Only two tasks fall below 0.5 (shown in red), both with notably low inter-annotator agreement, suggesting fundamental task ambiguity rather than limitations of human ability. Figure 16: Model consistency analysis showing performance ranges across tasks. Higher value indicates greater variability across models (lower consistency). Tasks with small ranges (high consistency) often align with high human agreement, whereas tasks with large ranges (low consistency) typically correspond to tasks where humans also struggle. This pattern suggests that both human and model performance reflect underlying task quality and clarity of task specification. 26 Model Parameters (Millions) Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct Li et al.
