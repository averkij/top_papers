            "title": "1 Introduction\nToxic language undermines the health of online communities, in-\ncluding those centered around software projects. A 2024 GitHub\nsurvey reported that 64.23% of developers experienced or witnessed\nnegative interactions [23], a slight increase from the 60.0% recorded\nin 2017 [72]; notably, 21.4% reported that such interactions led them\nto stop contributing. Despite the increasing recognition of the nega-\ntive impact of toxic interactions, to our best knowledge, all existing\ntoxicity detection methods are post-hoc [44, 51, 54, 56], identify-\ning toxic content only after it appears. While post-hoc detection\ncan mitigate some of the damage caused by toxic interactions, it\nfails to prevent the initial harm and may allow negative behaviors\nto persist unchecked for extended periods. A reactive approach\nnot only delays intervention but also burdens community modera-\ntors and risks alienating contributors who might have otherwise\nremained engaged. Consequently, there is a pressing need for proac-\ntive solutions that can anticipate and preemptively address potential\ntoxicity [39].",
            "content": "The primary strategy of proactive moderation involves human moderators actively engaging with ongoing conversations to prevent them from devolving into toxic behavior or, at the very least, to swiftly address any negativity should it arise and before it escalates any further [9, 58]. While effective, manual proactive moderation in OSS is impractical since moderators need to continuously monitor ongoing conversations across several communication channels (e.g., issues, chats, discussion boards). On the other hand, automated moderation offers scalability but demands deep understanding of community norms and context. However, unlike platforms such as (formerly Twitter) or Reddit, GitHub exhibits more subtle toxic behaviors, such as entitlement, miscommunication, or resistance to new practices, rather than overt aggression [25]. Moreover, domainspecific terms in software engineering (e.g., kill, dead, and dump) can pose challenges to generic automated toxicity detection [27, 56]. In this paper, we investigate how GitHub conversations derail into toxicity and present an automated approach for predicting such Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Mia Mohammad Imran, Robert Zita, Rahat Rizvi Rahman, Preetha Chatterjee, and Kostadin Damevski derailment. Leveraging recent advances in LLMs, we introduce novel framework that integrates advanced prompting techniques to support proactive moderation in OSS communication channels. More specifically, we address these three research questions: RQ1: What are the characteristics and patterns of conversational derailment in GitHub discussions? Effective prediction requires deep understanding of how technical conversations deteriorate. We curated dataset of 159 derailed toxic and 207 non-toxic GitHub conversations, annotated with derailment and toxicity points. Then, we empirically analyze temporal dynamics, linguistic patterns, and contextual triggers that precede toxicity. Our findings show that derailment on GitHub often precedes toxicity by narrow margin; the median distance between the first derailment point and the first toxic comment is just 3 comments, and 64% of toxic comments occurred within 24 hours. We identify set of consistent early warning signals at derailment points, including elevated use of reasoning terms (e.g., \"because\", \"since\"), WH-questions (e.g., \"why\", \"how\"), and second person pronouns (e.g., \"you\", \"your\"), as well as tones like Frustration or Impatience. RQ2: Can Large Language Models effectively predict conversational derailment on GitHub? We develop and evaluate novel LLM-based framework that generates interpretable conversation summaries to predict derailment. More specifically, we leverage Least-to-Most prompting to generate high-level Summaries of Conversation Dynamics (SCDs). These summaries abstract away technical details to highlight interaction patterns, emotional tone, and rhetorical shifts. Based on these SCDs, we predict the likelihood of conversation derailing into toxicity. To enable forecasting rather than detection, our approach for SCD generation only considers comments that occur before the first toxic remark, ensuring that predictions are based solely on pre-toxicity context. This design aligns with prior derailment forecasting formulations [9]. Our framework achieves F1-scores of 0.901 (Qwen) and 0.852 (Llama), significantly outperforming established baselines including CRAFT [9] and Hua et al.s few-shot SCD [26] approaches while maintaining interpretability for human moderators. Through ablation studies, we find that sentiment evolution and tension triggers are the most critical components for prediction accuracy. RQ3: To what extent does the proposed LLM-based derailment prediction approach generalize to independent GitHub datasets? We validate our approach on independent GitHub data to establish confidence in its broader applicability across different communities and time periods. External validation on the Raman et al.s [51] dataset (308 threads, 65 toxic and 243 non-toxic) shows reasonable generalizability, with our LtM strategy achieving F1-scores of 0.797 (Qwen) and 0.776 (Llama). The approach outperforms baselines on external data despite different collection methodologies, time periods, and class distributions, suggesting that our method captures broader patterns of GitHub conversational dynamics. Paper Contributions. Our investigation yields several key contributions. We provide the empirical characterization of GitHub conversational derailment patterns, revealing predictable deterioration signals including temporal proximity (median 3 comments before toxicity), distinctive linguistic markers, and common triggers. Figure 1: Example of toxic conversation on GitHub. We introduce novel LLM-based framework using structured Leastto-Most prompting to generate explainable Summaries of Conversation Dynamics, achieving F1-scores of 0.901 while maintaining interpretability. Finally, we provide actionable insights for OSS communities seeking to implement proactive moderation strategies. Our studys datasets, scripts, and output logs are publicly available online to facilitate reproducible research [2]."

            "content": "In online forums, toxicity often occurs after identifiable signs in the previous comments by the discussion participants [9]. In this research, we focus on understanding the early signs that conversation will turn toxic on GitHub issues and pull request discussions. These preceding comments, where it becomes clear that the conversation has moved away from being productive and taken turn towards negativity, are called derailment points [68]. Overall, toxic conversations often contain the following identifiable elements: 1) conversation-initiating comment, 2) derailment point comment, 3) first toxic comment, and 4) (zero or more) subsequent toxic (or non-toxic) comments. Figure 1 shows an example of toxic conversation, highlighting these different structures. In Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Table 1: Definitions and examples of uncivil tone-bearing discussion features (TBDF).

Toxicity is a subset\nof incivility, focusing on harmful language, while incivility more\nbroadly includes behaviors that undermine constructive discus-\nsion [19, 52]. More specifically, incivility is defined as “features of\ndiscussion that convey an unnecessarily disrespectful tone toward the\ndiscussion forum, its participants, or its topics\" [12], while toxicity\nis defined as “rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is",
            "content": "likely to make someone leave discussion\" [33]. Therefore, leveraging this incivility dataset provides an appropriate starting point for identifying toxic interactions in GitHub threads. We use an LLM-aided model-in-the-loop annotation approach to identify the uncivil comments that are also toxic [6]. Recent research shows that such model-in-the-loop annotation methodology works well for this type of data, including hate and violent speech detection tasks [21, 31, 46, 53, 64, 67, 71]. This methodology has been leveraged in software engineering toxicity detection as well [30, 44]. In our annotation, we leveraged the prompt released by Imran et al. for toxicity detection in GitHub bug reports [30]. For each uncivil comment identified in Ehsani et al.s dataset, we used GPT-4o to assess whether the comment was toxic, providing the full preceding conversation context up to that point. GPT-4o labeled 832 comments across 273 threads as toxic. To validate these predictions, two authors independently reviewed each flagged comment. The initial inter-annotator agreement was 0.78 (Cohens Kappa). The annotators resolved all disagreements through in-person discussion in order to finalize the toxicity annotations. Ehsani et al.s dataset is based on 404 locked conversations (issues and PRs) on GitHub where the reason they were locked is listed as too heated, spam, or off-topic. These 404 conversation threads contain 5961 comments annotated with various categories of uncivil TBDFs (Tone Bearing Discussion Features). The definitions and examples of the incivility-related TBDFs are shown in Table 1. Since the focus of our study is to identify conversations that derail into toxicity, we excluded conversations in which toxicity occurred in the initial post (i.e., we cannot predict derailment without processing the initial post). This step resulted in dataset consisting of 175 toxic GitHub threads."

During this procedure, they identified 23 threads as toxic and 207 as non-toxic. The final set of 207 non-toxic threads constitutes our NonToxic Conversations Dataset.

Given that Ehsani et al. previously annotated incivility in conversations containing TBDFs (see Table 1), we hypothesize that any uncivil TBDF occurring before toxic comment marks potential derailment point. However, our investigation revealed that derailment can also arise outside of these TBDF categories, particularly in the presence of pronounced negative politeness strategies (e.g., Im terribly sorry, but, Would you mind) [14]. Therefore, we annotate the derailment points following the definitions provided in Section 2 and use TBDFs as guide whenever they were available. Two of the papers authors reviewed the 198 toxic threads (175 from Ehsani et al.s heated conversations dataset and 23 obtained while creating the Non-Toxic Conversations Dataset) to identify possible derailment points preceding toxic comments. Their interannotator agreement reached 0.914 (Cohens Kappa). The annotators determined that 34/198 threads exhibited \"sudden toxicity\", i.e., toxic threads do not exhibit derailment; instead, in these conversations toxicity occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. We excluded them from our analysis. The annotators discussed where they disagreed and resolved the disagreements. In 88 cases, they found multiple derailment points before the toxic comment. In 71 cases, annotators found exactly 1 derailment point. We also excluded 5 cases where the annotators could not agree whether there existed derailment point or not. Finally, we retained 159 toxic threads (142 from Ehsani et al.s and 17 newly identified threads from Section 3.2) with 382 derailment points, which form our Derailed Toxic Dataset."

Relative to conversations on other online platforms such as Reddit and Wikipedia, GitHubs technical conversations are distinct in the way that they exhibit toxicity [43]. Research also noted that diffient communities exhibit different characteristics in toxic communication patterns [60]. Therefore, it stands to reason that conversational derailment on this platform may also be distinct. In this RQ, we empirically examine how conversational derailment manifests on GitHub. Specifically, we investigate: 1) the dynamics of conversational derailment by examining its timing and distance from the threads start, 2) the linguistic signals preceding derailment, 3) the presence of uncivil tones, and 4) common triggers that lead discussions off track. We base our analysis on the Derailed Toxic Dataset. While limited in size and predominantly sourced from locked as heated GitHub issues, this dataset is sufficient to observe derailment patterns. Locked issues are not concern, as the locking occurs after the derailment and toxicity have occurred, and the locking mechanism does not affect the communication pattern. In addition, for the empirical analysis in this section, as our focus is on the interaction patterns leading up to toxicity, for any discussion thread, we exclude the comments that occurred after the first toxic comment."

This shows the importance of timely intervention. However, more than 25% cases (40/159), the difference is more than 7 days, which indicates toxicity can also occur after long period of derailment. This characteristic contrasts with platforms like Wikipedia, where discussion is likely inactive if the last comment was added 23 days ago [58]. Note that in the few cases where there are multiple derailment point comments preceding the toxic comment, for this analysis, we considered the first derailment point in the conversation."

Two annotators collaboratively categorized (see Table 2) the unigrams into linguistic groups using the card sorting method [59]. They met in person, discussed, and resolved differences, consulting dictionary as needed. Based on these categories, we counted the frequency of each unigram in the derailment point comments after applying basic preprocessing steps (e.g., tokenization and lemmatization). Table 2 shows the percentages of occurrence in derailment points (382 count) along with the first toxic comments (159 count), and regular comments (non toxic and non derailment point comments); the total regular comments count were 1,371. We observed that in derailment points the elevated use of second person pronouns (you, your, etc) [38], negation terms (not, no, etc.), WH questions (what, why, how, where, etc.), reasoning terms (because, since, etc.), communication verbs (say, comment, tell, etc.), and emphasis terms (actually, really, etc.) than general comments but lower than toxic comments. As Table 2 shows, all lexical differences between derailment and regular comments were statistically significant under Chisquare test of independence [41] (𝜒 2, 𝑝 < 0.05) after applying the BenjaminiHochberg (BH) correction [8]. Effect sizes measured by Cramers 𝑉 (0.050.13) indicate small to moderate associations, confirming consistent but modest linguistic distinctions. Derailment point comments frequently combine structured reasoning with mild confrontation. Reasoning terms dominate (70.4%), often paired with negation (70.2%) and direct questioning (57.1%), reflecting logical yet oppositional exchanges. Compared with regular comments, derailment points show +16.8% more second-person targeting, +14.9% more negation, and +13.2% more questioning. Although they share similar reasoning intensity with toxic comments (70.4% vs. 70.4%), they contain less personal confrontation (60.7% vs. 75.5%) and reduced emphasis (53.4% vs. 59.7%). These findings suggest that derailment often emerges through argumentative yet non-abusive phrasing, where discussions shift from logical disagreement toward personal conflict."

Specifically, we replace general conversation examples with\ndomain-specific interactions, such as discussions around pull re-\nquest rejections or issue closures. Additionally, we instruct the\nmodel to ignore technical details like code snippets or file paths,\nand instead focus on conversational dynamics, i.e., how partici-\npants respond to one another, where misunderstandings arise, and\nhow tone shifts over time. A typical summary generated using this\nGitHub-adapted SCD prompt is as follows:",
            "content": "Multiple users debate reverting recent PR. Speaker1 expresses strong opposition, referencing previous incident involving similar code. Speaker2 challenges Speaker1s framing and accuses them of misrepresenting past decisions. Speaker3 supports Speaker2 and notes that Speaker1 had already raised this concern in another thread. Speaker1 becomes confrontational, citing perceived pattern of dismissal. The conversation becomes increasingly heated as past interactions are used to question motives. The tone escalates, with limited signs of resolution. While this adaptation yielded clearer and more relevant summaries, we hypothesized that it may not yet be optimal. As Hua et al. developed SCD prompts targeting general-purpose conversations, it may not be most effective for the highly technical discussions found on GitHub. We explored whether decomposing the problem [35] and integrating the properties of GitHub derailed conversations, uncovered in Section 4, could yield better SCDs for predicting derailment on GitHub. Previous research shows that decomposing the prompts into incremental steps enhances the LLMs accuracy [35, 69]. Inspired by those studies, we adopted Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting strategy [69], and designed step-wise summarization prompt that guides the model from high-level observations to detect smaller breakdowns in conversation patterns. This allows us to integrate our insights from Section 4. We incorporated the following key components into the LtM prompt (as Steps 36): (1) Individual Intentions (II), feature we directly integrated from Hua et al.s framework to analyze participants motivations and goals. Morrill et al. similarly found that dialogue is shaped by intentions such as agreement, disagreement, confrontation [45]. Additionally, studies have shown that communication styles play role in shaping interactions within GitHub discussions [7, 63]. Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA (2) Conversational Features (CF) (e.g., questioning, rhetoric), where we adopted the categories established by Hua et al. [26], which includes rhetorical questions, hedging, questioning logic, and other linguistic patterns. This approach aligns with our findings described in Section 4.2; (3) Sentiment and Tonal Features (STF), which capture emotional dynamics and shifts throughout the discussion, enabling us to track how sentiment evolves before derailment occurs, as discussed in Section 4.3; and (4) Tension Triggers (TT), which identify potential catalysts for escalating conflict that serve as early indicators of possible derailment, based on our findings described in Section 4.4; We explicitly instruct the model to exclude technical content and focus on interactional dynamics. The summary is synthesized at the final step. In developing the LtM prompt, we initially experimented with prompts that included explicit definitions for each reasoning step, for instance, describing categories of tension triggers, conversation strategies or specifying tonal cues like sarcasm or frustration. However, we observed that such definitions often introduced unnecessary verbosity and led to inconsistent outputs in SCD generation. In contrast, we found that more concise, open-ended prompt, omitting explicit definitions, led to more consistent and focused outputs. Rather than prescribing rigid categories, this design allowed the model to apply its learned understanding of conversational structure. The final LtM prompt is as follows: Least-to-Most (LtM) SCD Generator Prompt You are skilled Conversation Analyst specializing in GitHub discussions. Your objective is to capture the conversation dynamics without getting caught in the technical details. Your Analysis Method: Follow these steps in order, building your understanding from basic patterns to complex dynamics: Step 1: Identify Main Elements: Identify the main elements by quickly scanning the conversation and pinpointing the key components or topics being discussed. Step 2: Enforce Exclusion Criteria Do NOT include: - Any technical claims, arguments, or explanations - Any code names, module names, or PR details - Any direct or indirect quotations - Any mention of what was being implemented or reviewed Example 1 (Excluded): \"The discussion addressed discrepancies in 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑒_𝑎𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 () outputs [...].\" Step 3: Note Individual Intentions Infer what each participant is aiming to achieve. Example: [...] Step 4: Identify Conversation Strategies Identify rhetorical or structural tactics used by each speaker.

Use descriptors such as neutral, guarded, dismissive, confrontational, collaborative, defensive, escalating. Avoid inference. [...] Step 6: Find Tension Triggers Detect explicit shifts in tone, rhythm, or interaction style that signal rising tensiononly when clearly supported by observable evidence. Avoid inference. [...] Step 7: Synthesize Trajectory Summary Combine insights from steps 1-6 to create concise trajectory summary. Remember: Your value lies in revealing the human dynamics beneath technical discussions. Focus on HOW people communicate, not WHAT technical points they make.

USER_02 and USER_03 express reluctance to create new major version, leading USER_01 to interpret this as lack of future planning for the project. The conversation shifts to more confrontational tone when USER_02 suggests an alternative fix and sarcastically requests an apology from USER_01, which escalates USER_01s response into threat of ceasing contributions and blocking participants. USER_02 attempts to de-escalate by reiterating the availability of an alternative solution but maintains guarded stance."

The results of this experiment are shown in Table 4. Our Least-to-Most SCD prompting strategy demonstrates strong performance across both models, achieving F1-scores of 0.901 (Qwen) and 0.852 (Llama) at the 0.3 threshold. The approach maintains balanced performance with high precision (0.945 for Qwen, 0.890 for Llama) while preserving good recall (0.862 for Qwen, 0.818 for Llama). Compared to the two baselines, our method significantly outperforms CRAFT, which consistently underperformed across all thresholds with best F1-score at 0.580. Against Hua et al.s SCD prompting strategy, our approach shows superior results at most thresholds, particularly excelling at the practical 0.3-0.7 range where balanced precision-recall trade-offs are crucial [10]. For the Qwen model, the Least-to-Most strategy achieved the highest F1-scores across all threshold values. similar trend was observed for the Llama model, with the exception of the 0.1 threshold where Hua et al.s strategy performed better due to very high recall (156/159 correct predictions) but at the cost of much lower precision. This trade-off highlights an important consideration: while high recall captures most toxic instances, low precision leads to excessive false positives. In GitHub repositories where non-toxic conversations vastly outnumber toxic ones, maintaining high precision is critical to avoid unnecessary false alarms [51]. However, the high precision should not come at the cost of low precision as Chang et al. noted that balancing precision and recall is crucial, as too many false positives reduce tools helpfulness while too many false negatives reduce effectiveness [10]. At higher thresholds ( 0.3), our Least-to-Most strategy ensures good F1-scores with high precision, making it practically viable for deployment. Based on these results, we envision threshold-based intervention strategy to mitigate toxicity: higher thresholds (e.g., 𝜃 > 0.7) Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA could alert moderators to review flagged content, while lower thresholds (e.g., 𝜃 = 0.3 𝑡𝑜 0.7) could trigger automated bots to issue reminders promoting civil discourse."

We limited the error analysis to the best-performing configuration, i.e., the LtM SCD prompting strategy on the Qwen model at 0.3 threshold. We conducted an open coding process to analyze the errors [65]. Two authors independently reviewed all misclassified cases and assigned preliminary labels to them. They then met to compare their labels, resolve disagreements, and refine the categories through iterative discussion. This process was repeated until complete consensus was achieved. There were two types of error categories: 1) 8 cases where the model predicted non-toxic conversations as derailing; and 2) 22 cases where the model predicted derailed toxic conversations as non-derailing. Two authors reviewed the conversations, examined the generated SCD, and determined the most likely reason for the error. They finalized the error categories using open coding, and further improved them thorough discussion and applying axial coding [1], with some cases belonging to more than one category. In the 8 false positives, the main issues were the model overestimating tension in otherwise civil exchanges (3 cases), and situations where the SCD was accurate but the predictor misjudged the tones seriousness with respect to toxicity (3 cases). Among the 22 false negatives, most errors were due to missing or underestimating subtle toxic signals like frustration (10 cases), failure to detect sarcasm or nuanced tones (3 cases), accurate SCDs with flawed predictor judgment (3 cases), and cases where toxicity occurred long after derailment (3 cases), reducing the perceived severity. To illustrate, consider the following SCD where the model overestimated the seriousness of the tone as confrontational when the commentators were sharing their perspective, Participants discuss changes to game mechanics involving Repair Facility and Heavy Repair Turrets (HRT). [... ] The conversation shifts from neutral to confrontational as participants assert their viewpoints and express dissatisfaction with proposed changes.. In reality, participants were simply exchanging perspectives without hostility. In another case, the model missed sarcasm about image quality: Two users discuss an image and JSON file issue. [...] reiterating concerns about image quality, the tone remains critical but not confrontational, focusing on clarity and quality standards. Here, subtle humor and sarcasm were misinterpreted as neutral critique, highlighting the models difficulty with nuanced tones.

Intervention thresholds should be calibrated according to moderation goals. Higher thresholds (e.g., > 0.7) are suited for passive alerts aimed at de-escalation [48], while intermediate thresholds (e.g., 0.30.7) can trigger automated reminders that act as conversational mediators [58]. This can be integrating within existing GitHubs infrastructure. Building on GitHubs current tagging options (e.g., abuse, off-topic, resolved) for [22], dedicated derailment tag could streamline moderator review and response. Maintainers could incorporate the models SCDs into issue and pull request dashboards to identify threads showing early signs of tension. Integration frequency should align with repository activity and cost constraints. Since 64% of toxic exhanges occur within 24 hours of derailment, higher-frequency runs (e.g., hourly) are most useful for new or rapidly evolving threads, whereas running the model after each new comment suffices for slower discussions. The SCDs provide interpretable summaries that can help maintainers make informed moderation decisions. Recommendations for Researchers. Future research should build upon the current study by refining prompt designs to capture conversational signals of derailment more consistently across contexts. While this work has demonstrated the value of modeling tonal shifts, tension triggers, and sentiment trajectories, further efforts are needed to generalize these features across diverse OSS communities, languages, and moderation norms. Refinement should also aim to reduce prompt sensitivity and improve reproducibility of LLM-based summarization across datasets. Developing standardized benchmarks across multiple platforms, such as GitHub and BugZilla, would enable consistent evaluation and cross-comparison of models. These benchmarks should include annotated derailment points, incivility categories, and moderation outcomes. Efficiency and scalability remain key challenges. Incrementally updating summaries with new comments, rather than reprocessing Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA entire threads, could allow nearreal-time assessment with reduced computational cost. Beyond accuracy, researchers should evaluate latency, resource trade-offs, and feedback dynamics between predictive models and human moderators. Transparency and explainability should remain research priorities. Future work should further refine how SCD convey rationales for tension and escalation, improving trust and accountability [58]."

Our work builds on this line by proposing proactive detection strategy, shifting from retrospective classification to early forecasting of derailment events that precede toxicity. Conversation derailment. Predictive studies of derailment have largely centered around Wikipedia and Reddit [5, 9, 26, 38, 40, 68]. The CRAFT model [9] pioneered early detection of online toxicity via linguistic and structural features. Hua et al. [26] introduced the concept of Summaries of Conversation Dynamics (SCD) for forecasting conversational trajectory, foundation we extend using GitHub-specific dynamics. Recent work also investigates hierarchical transformers, neural network, user behavior modeling, and contextual features such as reply structure and edit markers [3, 4, 15, 24, 34, 40, 66]. However, these approaches often lack domain adaptation for technical forums like GitHub, where toxicity emerges through more subtle signals like entitlement or miscommunication [25, 43].

Internal validity relates to whether the results are attributable to our method rather than uncontrolled factors. Our use of LLMs introduces variability due to stochastic generation and prompt sensitivity; small changes in input can affect model outputs. Moreover, although we followed structured annotation process, human error or bias may still influence labeling consistency. We addressed these issues by employing model-in-the-loop framework, cross-checking annotations, and designing prompts systematically to minimize ambiguity. External validity. External validity reflects the generalization of our findings beyond the specific dataset and setting. Our dataset is limited to GitHub issue threads and may not generalize to other platforms such as JIRA, GitLab, or non-OSS communities, which have different conversational norms. Additionally, the curated dataset is relatively small, potentially limiting applicability across all GitHub communities. Furthermore, because many public GitHub discussions are part of the web-scale data used in LLM pretraining, it is possible that some threads in our dataset overlap with or resemble the models pretraining data. This potential exposure may slightly inflate performance estimates, underscoring the need to validate the framework on data from unseen platforms or domains. While our prompting framework is domain-agnostic and we have evaluated on different dataset, broader validation is needed to confirm its wider applicability."

            "title": "10 Conclusion\nWe present a proactive approach to forecast toxicity detection in\nOpen Source Software communities through early identification of\nconversational derailment on GitHub. We annotated and analyzed\na dataset of 159 derailed toxic conversations and 207 non-toxic\nconversations. We developed a novel LLM-based prompt using\nLeast-to-Most strategy to generate Summaries of Conversation Dy-\nnamics and predict conversation derailment, achieving F1-scores of\n0.901 with Qwen and 0.852 with Llama, significantly outperform-\ning established baselines. External validation on an independent\nimbalanced dataset yielded F1-scores up to 0.797, demonstrating\ngeneralizability.",
            "content": "Our findings show that early derailment prediction is feasible and effective strategy for moderating technical discussions. The explainable nature of our SCD-based approach enables transparent moderation decisions and flexible threshold-based interventions, allowing communities to shift from reactive to proactive moderation strategies. While our work has limitations regarding platform specificity and detection of sudden toxicity without warning signs, it provides the empirical foundation and practical tools necessary for implementing early warning systems in real-world OSS projects. Future work should extend to other platforms, incorporate behavioral signals, and evaluate live deployment and intervention outcomes Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Mia Mohammad Imran, Robert Zita, Rahat Rizvi Rahman, Preetha Chatterjee, and Kostadin Damevski to support healthier, more inclusive OSS communities. Another key direction can be generating human-written SCD in GitHub conversations and do instruct tune LLMs to mitigate the errors we observe at Section 5.5 so that the LLMs can do better SCD generation.
