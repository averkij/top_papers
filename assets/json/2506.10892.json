From quantum mechanics, where the quantized energy states of electrons arise as solutions to continuous wave equations, to the Fourier decomposition of the Heaviside function, which results in trigonometric series, and to the binary logic of digital circuits, fundamentally driven by smooth analog currents, 1Computer and Information Science, Cornell Tech, NYC, USA. 2School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland.

While both are separate Markov processes, applying arg max maps Gaussian latents wt Rn to discrete latents zt V, transforming their marginals from qt(.x; αt) (6) to qt(.x; (αt)) (1) and adjusting diffusion parameters from αt to αt = (αt) (10). Notably, the ELBO for Uniformstate diffusion induces tighter bound on the likelihood than Gaussian diffusion, as established in Theorem 3.1. discreteness has repeatedly and naturally emerged from an underlying continuum. Our work continues this tradition by demonstrating that discrete diffusion process is, in fact, an emergent phenomenon of an underlying continuous Gaussian diffusion process. This perspective enables the design of faster training and sampling algorithms for discrete diffusion models. Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) are powerful generative models inspired by physics. Gaussian diffusion models excel at synthesizing realistic and high-quality continuous-valued data such as images (Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022), audio (Kong et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b), and videos (Ho et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Esser et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023). Gaussian diffusion is well studiedthe success of these models is rooted in techniques such as efficient parameterizations of the denoising model, which improve upon the standard meanparameterization (Ho et al., 2020; Salimans & Ho, 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), faster training techniques (Kingma et al., 2021), efficient samplers (Karras et al., 2022), and distillaThe Diffusion Duality tion schemes that enable single-step generation (Song et al., 2023; Song & Dhariwal, 2023; Yin et al., 2024). While Gaussian diffusion is well-studied, it underperforms discrete diffusion models on tasks involving discrete data such as text (Sahoo et al., 2024b), graphs (Liu et al., 2023a), and molecules (Lee et al., 2025). However, from the perspective of Gaussian diffusion, the design space for discrete diffusion models remains primitive: mean parameterization for the denoising model (Sahoo et al., 2024a; Schiff et al., 2025) and slow ancestral sampling (Austin et al., 2021) are still the dominant approaches. Recent work on distilling Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) improves sampling speed (Deschenaux & Gulcehre, 2024), but performance degrades severely in the few-step regime. Unlike Gaussian diffusion models with Probability Flow ODEs (Song et al., 2020), MDMs lack an implicit property: deterministic mapping from noise to data. This property is vital for few-step distillation methods (Song et al., 2023; Frans et al., 2024), but MDMs forgo it due to their deterministic prior, which requires stochasticity during sampling. Our objective is (1) to design framework for discrete diffusion that enables the transfer of advanced training and inference techniques from Gaussian diffusion to discrete diffusion models. And (2) create language models that support few-step generation. To this end, we focus on Uniform-state Diffusion Models (USDMs) (Austin et al., 2021). In this paper, we discover very remarkable property of USDMsthese emerge from Gaussian diffusion processes as illustrated in Fig. 1. We call this phenomenon the Diffusion Duality which expands the design space of USDMs, making it possible to incorporate techniques developed for Gaussian diffusion. Notably, USDMs models allow token updates during reverse sampling unlike MDMs, naturally correcting earlier mistakes without requiring costly predictor-corrector (Zhao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025) stepssaving function evaluations (NFEs). However, these models have historically underperformed compared to MDMs (Austin et al., 2021; Lou et al., 2023), raising the key question: Can USDMs be made competitive with MDMs? And more importantly, can the implicit property of the underlying Gaussian diffusion be leveraged for fast, few-step generation? We answer both questions with Duo, rich framework of theoretical connections between USDMs and Gaussian diffusion. Duo enriches the design space of USDMs by incorporating Gaussian diffusion, which allows us to develop efficient training strategies that accelerate the training of USDMs, significantly reducing the performance gap between MDMs and AR models on standard language generation benchmarks. Notably, we surpass AR models on 3 out of 7 zero-shot datasets  (Table 2)  . Furthermore, this duality allows us to adapt consistency distillation (Song et al., 2023) from Gaussian to discrete diffusion, reducing NFEs from 1024 to 8 with minimal effect on sample quality (Sec. 5.2). Importantly, in the low-NFE regime, Duo outperforms MDMs. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We establish theoretical connection between continuous and discrete diffusion, demonstrating that discrete diffusion arises from an underlying continuous Gaussian diffusion. This insight enables the transfer of techniques from the continuous domain to the discrete setting, opening up new possibilities. (2) Our framework doubles the training speed of USDMs by introducing low-variance curriculum, and (3) accelerates sampling by two orders of magnitude by adapting efficient distillation methods from continuous diffusion models. 2. Background Notation We represent scalar discrete random variables that can take values as one-hot column vectors and define = {x {0, 1}K i=1 xi = 1} as the set of all such vectors. Define Cat(; π) as the categorical distribution over classes with probabilities given by π , where denotes the K-simplex. Additionally, let 1 = {1}K and a, and respectively denote the dot and Hadamard products between two vectors and b. We use x1L ℓ=1 to denote sequences of length L. and [xℓ]L 2.1. Discrete Diffusion Models Consider the clean data drawn from the data distribution qdata. In the discrete diffusion framework (SohlDickstein et al., 2015; Austin et al., 2021) the complex data distribution qdata is mapped to simple distribution through sequence of Markov states. Sahoo et al. (2024a) propose simplified variantan interpolating noise frameworkwhere the forward process (qt)t[0,1] smoothly transitions from qdata to prior distribution Cat(.; π), by introducing latent variables zt whose marginals conditioned on at time are given by: qt(.x; αt) = Cat(.; αtx + (1 αt)π), (1) where the diffusion parameter αt [0, 1] is strictly decreasing function in t, with αt=0 1 and αt=1 0. discrete diffusion process is characterized by the time evolution of marginals follows linear ordinary differential equation (Anderson, 2012): dt qt = Qtqt, (2) where Qt RKK is the state transition matrix. There are two prominent variants of interpolating noise frameworks: USDMs that feature uniform prior over 2 The Diffusion Duality (π = 1/K) (Schiff et al., 2025), and MDMs (Sahoo et al., 2024b), which use masked token prior π = where is special mask token. These two frameworks exhibit distinct behaviors during the forward corruption process. In USDMs, given categorical latent can either remain unchanged or transition to any other category in with equal probability, determined by the diffusion timestep. In contrast, MDMs either retain the clean data or transition to the masked token m; once masked, the token remains in the masked state; see Fig. 5 for illustrative examples. This forward dynamics influences the reverse generation process: in USDMs, predicted tokens can continue to evolve, while in MDMs, once token is unmasked, it remains fixed. To address the limitations of MDMs, predictor-corrector methods have been proposed (Campbell et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2025), though they introduce additional computational overhead. In contrast, USDMs models inherently possess self-correcting property that AR / MDMs lack, making them equivalent to training autoregressive models for every possible ordering (Hoogeboom et al., 2021; Ou et al., 2024). Accordingly, our primary focus in this work is on the USDMs framework. Schiff et al. (2025) show that for USDMs, the state transition matrix Qt is given by: Qt = α Kαt [11 KI], (3) where α posterior for timestep < is given as: is the time derivative of αt and the true reverse qst(. zt,x) = Cat .; Kαtzt + (αts αt)zt Kαtzt, + 1 αt + (αs αt)x + (1 αts)(1 αs)1/K Kαtzt, + 1 αt (4) where αts = αt/αs. Since is unavailable during inference, we approximate it with neural network xθ [0, 1] with parameters θ. The resulting approximate reverse posterior is defined as pθ st(.zt) = qst(. zt, = xθ(zt, t)). The denoising model is trained by minimizing the Negative Evidence Lower Bound (NELBO) (Schiff et al., 2025): NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],qt(ztx;αt) f(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt; x), (5) where is defined in (47). Sampling from this model begins with the prior zt=1 1/K, and proceeds via ancestral denoising, i.e., by drawing zs pθ st(.zt) at each step. 2.2. Gaussian Diffusion Models Similar to USDMs, Gaussian diffusion maps data distribution qdata to simple prior distribution usually Normal distribution (0, IK), through sequence of noisy latents wt qt(.x), whose marginal distribution is given by: qt(.x; αt) = (αtx, (1 αt 2)IK), (6) where the diffusion parameter αt [0, 1] is monotonically decreasing function in t. For αt=0 = 1 and αt=1 = 0, the NELBO for such process is given as (Kingma et al., 2021): NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],qt(wtx; αt)ν(t)x xθ(wt, t)2 (7) where ν(t) is the time derivative of the signal-to-noise ratio ν(t) = αt 2) for the Gaussian diffusion process. 2/(1 αt 2.3. Consistency Distillation Consistency models (Song et al., 2023; Song & Dhariwal, 2023) are class of generative models that define bijective mapping between the samples from the noise distribution (0, IK) and the data distribution qdata. They build on deterministic samplers for Gaussian diffusion (Song et al., 2020; 2021), specifically using the Probability-Flow ODE (PF-ODE). Given pre-trained Gaussian diffusion model xθ, which requires hundreds or thousands of sampling steps, Consistency Distillation is popular technique to distil them down to fewer steps generation that enables much faster generation. The distillation begins with teacher model xθ , often the Exponentially Moving Average (EMA) of the student model xθ obtained during the course of training. noisy sample wt is drawn from the forward process qt(.x) (6), and less noisy sample ws is obtained by numerically solving one PF-ODE step using xθ. The student model is then trained to match the teachers estimate of the clean sample minimizing the following loss: L(θ, θ) = λ(t)d (xθ(wt, t), xθ (ws, s)) , (8) where RK RK R+ denotes the error between the teacher models reconstruction xθ (ws, t) and the student models reconstruction xθ(wt, t) of the original sample and λ [0, 1] R+ is weighting function that scales the loss based on the diffusion time-step t. 3. The Diffusion Duality Unlike discrete diffusion, Gaussian diffusion is replete with well-established empirical techniques, which have driven significant advances in both training (Ho et al., 2020; Salimans & Ho, 2022; Zheng et al., 2023) and sampling (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2023; Song & Dhariwal, 2023; Yin et al., 2024). Our goal in this section is to establish theoretical bridge between discrete-state diffusion and continuous-state diffusion, which will enable us to leverage tools from the later to improve the former. The Diffusion Duality We propose simple method to map Gaussian latent to the discrete space: the arg max operator. But does this transformation of latents also transform Gaussian diffusion process into discrete one? necessary and sufficient condition for this is that the marginal distribution of the discretized vector satisfies the characteristic ODE of discrete diffusion process (2). We first derive closed-form expression for this marginal and show that arg max maps the marginals of Gaussian diffusion to those of Uniform-state discrete diffusion, including transformation of the diffusion parameters (9). Finally, we verify that this marginal evolves according to (11), establishing that the discretized Gaussian latent follows Uniform-state discrete diffusion process. We begin by defining Gaussian diffusion process on as per (6), with qt=0 qdata and qt=1 = (0, IK). Let wt qt(.x; αt) be an intermediate latent at time t. Next, define the operation arg max RK to map continuous vector RK to the one-hot vector corresponding to the index of its largest entry in w, i.e., arg max(w) = arg maxzV zw. Discrete Marginals Let zt = arg max(wt) and Pt(.x) denote its conditional pmf marginalized over wt qt(.x; αt). In Suppl. A.1, we show: zt Pt (.x; (αt)) = Cat (.; (αt)x + (1 (αt)) 1 ) , (9) where the function [0, 1] [0, 1] is the Diffusion Transformation operator, defined as: ( αt) = 1 [ ϕ (z αt 1 αt 2 ) ΦK1 (z)dz 1 ] , (10) where ϕ(z) = exp(z2)/ tribution and Φ(z) = lative distribution function. 2π is the standard Normal dis2π is its cumuz exp(t2/2)dz/ Transition Dynamics Next, we examine how the discrete marginal Pt evolves with time as the continuous vector wt undergoes Gaussian diffusion. In Suppl. A.2 we show that Pt evolves as per the following linear ODE: dt Pt = (αt) KT (αt) [11 KI] Pt (11) Qt where represents the time derivative of . (11) characterizes Markovian Uniform-state discrete diffusion process with diffusion parameter (αt) as per (2) and (3) Uniform-state discrete diffusion and Gaussian diffusion bridged by the arg max operator: The arg max operation transforms Gaussian diffusion into Uniform-state diffusion, with the diffusion parameters related by (10). More formally, this can be expressed as: qt(ztx; (αt)) = [arg max] qt(wtx; αt) (12) where the operator denotes the pushforward of the Kdimensional Gaussian density qt under the arg max map, yielding categorical distribution qt with classes. Thus, as diffuses in the discrete space via Uniformstate process, there exists an underlying continuous-space representation in which follows Gaussian diffusion, as illustrated in Fig. 1. ELBO Note that these two processes are separate Markov chains with no transitions between them, and they induce different variational bounds on the log-likelihood. Specifically, they yield distinct ELBOs: (5) for the discrete diffusion process and (7) for the Gausssian diffusion process. Theorem 3.1. The ELBO for the Uniform-state discrete diffusion is tighter than for the underlying Gaussian diffusion. We provide detailed proof in Suppl. A.3. Briefly, we show: log pθ(x) ELBO (q, pθ; x) ELBO (q, pθ; x) , (13) with equality when pθ is the optimal denoiser. Since the ELBO is inherently tighter in the discrete space, it is advantageous to design the denoising model to model discrete latents. Hence, we choose (5) as the training and evaluation objective. The term in (5) involves materializing the one-hot vector x, which increases memory usage and slows down training. We reformulate it with Rao-Blackwellized objective (48) that avoids materializing one-hot vectors and also reduces training variance, resulting in faster training and lower perplexity (Sec. 5.1). Sampler To sample from Duo, we use ancestral sampling for USDMs (Sec. 2.1). Furthermore, to improve text quality, we propose Greedy-Tail Sampler, that improves the sample quality by decreasing the sample entropy in manner similar to nucleus sampling in AR models models (Holtzman et al., 2020). Specifically, during the final denoising step, instead of sampling the clean sequence via pθ 0δ(.), we perform greedy decoding: = arg max(pθ 0δ(.)) where δ denotes the time discretization. Duality The implications of (9) and (11) are quite profound. These reveal fundamental connection between We exploit this duality to incorporate Gaussian diffusion into the design space of USDMs. This allows us to design 4 The Diffusion Duality low-variance training algorithm that leads to faster training (Sec. 4.1) and distillation scheme that unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models (Sec. 4.2). 4. Applications We now present two applications where discrete diffusion models benefit from leveraging the underlying Gaussian diffusion. In Sec. 4.1, we introduce curriculum learning strategy that reduces training variance and leads to faster training. Then, in Sec. 4.2, we propose distillation algorithm that cuts the number of sampling steps by two orders of magnitude with minimal impact on sample quality. We extend our discrete diffusion framework to sequences x1L qdata of length L. The forward process and the reverse process factorize independently over tokens as: qt(z1L txℓ; αt) based on (1) and sz1L pθ(z1L , t)) based on (4), respectively. Here, xθ [0, 1] denotes the denoising model. Consequently, the sequence-level NELBO decomposes into sum of token-level losses: x1L; αt) = ℓ[L] qt(zℓ z1L ) = ℓ[L] qst(zℓ θ(z1L , xℓ NELBO (q, pθ; x1L) = EtU [0,1],qt ℓ[L] fDuo(zℓ t, xℓ θ(z1L , t), αt; xℓ). (14) where fDuo is defined in (48). 4.1. Faster Training using Curriculum Learning Curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) gradually exposes models to increasingly complex data, starting with simpler, easier-to-denoise noise patterns and progressing to more challenging ones. Here, we design curriculum for USDMs by exploiting the underlying Gaussian diffusion. Similar to relaxation methods in discrete gradient estimation (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017), our curriculum is centered around annealing the temperature parameter of smooth approximation of arg max. We reformulate the NELBO for discrete diffusion in terms of arg max over Gaussian latents (Sec. 4.1.1). We provide lower-variance but biased estimator of the ELBO by relaxing the argmax operator with tempered softmax (Sec. 4.1.2). At the beginning of this curriculum, training resembles simple Gaussian diffusion process with the ELBO for discrete diffusion and transitions towards the standard discrete diffusion process. 4.1.1. DISCRETE NELBO WITH GAUSSIAN LATENTS Consider the discrete diffusion NELBO (14), which marginalizes fDuo over qt(.x1L; αt). Our goal is to re-express this objective in terms of Gaussian latents w1L qt(.x1L; αt) such that marginalizing over wt yields the same numerical value for the discrete latents z1L the NELBO. In Suppl. B.1, we show: NELBO(q, pθ; x1L) = t,qt(z1L x1L;αt) ℓ[L] fDuo(zℓ t, xℓ θ(z1L , t), αt; xℓ) = t,qt(w1L x; αt) ℓ[L] xθ ([arg max(wℓ fDuo(zℓ = arg max(wℓ t), )]L ℓ=1, t) , αt = (αt); xℓ), (15) where αt = (αt) is obtained via (10) from the Gaussian diffusion coefficient αt and also verify this empirically. As discussed in Sec. 3, these are distinct Markov chains whose marginal distributions are related only through (12). This reparameterization underpins our curriculum learning strategy which we present in the next section. 4.1.2. LOW-VARIANCE TRAINING LOSS To reduce training variance, we replace arg max(wℓ t) in the denoising model input (15) with tempered softmax. We argue that this substitution eases recovery of the clean sequence from its noisy counterpart, and that the difficulty of this recovery is regulated by the temperature parameter. As shown in prior work (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017), arg max is limiting case of softmax: arg max(wℓ t) = lim τ 0+ softmax(wℓ t/τ ). (16) We relax this operation by setting the temperature parameter τ > 0. While computing the NELBO in (15), the discrete diffusion parameter αt must span [0, 1], as does its Gaussian counterpart αt. The diffusion transformation operator (10) has crucial property: as the vocabulary size increases, small sub-interval [a, 1]0a<1 within the domain of is sufficient to map onto the full range [0, 1]. In Suppl. C.7 we observe for = 30K that when αt [0.85, 1], the corresponding αt = (αt) nearly spans the entire interval [0, 1]. This suggests that when evaluating the NELBO using Gaussian latents constrained to this narrow range of αt, the discrete NELBO should approach zerosince the latents contain mostly signal and minimal noise. However, in practice, the NELBO remains largely unchanged. Why? The key reason lies in the discretization step. Even small amounts of Gaussian noise in wt ℓ can cause the output of the arg max operation to change drastically, as it is highly sensitive to perturbations. As result, much of the extra signal is lost due to discretization. To mitigate this, we allow the denoising model xθ to access the continuous latent wℓ through tempered softmax in (16). This relaxation helps preserve more of the signal, making the reconstruction task easier. In this way, the temperature parameter τ effectively controls the difficulty of the learning problem. The Diffusion Duality Deterministic Discrete Trajectories (DDT) Consistency Distillation relies on PF-ODE parameterized by the denoising model. In our setting, the trained discrete denoiser xθ cannot be used to parameterize the ODE in the Gaussian space, as it operates only on discrete samplesthe temperature τ in (17) is reduced to zero by the end of the training. To circumvent this, we construct deterministic trajectory in Gaussian space by reversing the PF-ODE using an optimal denoiser, and then project this trajectory to the discrete domain. Let PODE denote such trajectory. Given clean data point x1L qdata and Gaussian noise ϵ1L = {ϵℓ (0, IK)ℓ [L]}, PODE(x1L, ϵ1L) = {[αtxℓ + t[0,1] ; see Suppl. B.2.1 for detailed discussion. Next, we project this trajectory to the discrete space via the arg max operator: 1 αt 2ϵℓ]L ℓ=1} PDDT(x1L, ϵ1L) = {[arg max(αtxℓ + 1 αt 2ϵℓ)]L ℓ=1} . (18) t[0,1] PDDT serves as proxy for the absence of proper PF-ODE defined in the discrete space; see Fig. 5 for an illustrate example. jδ, z1L )z1L Distillation Given teacher model xθ , our goal is to distill it into student model xθ that generates samples of similar quality but in fewer steps. To perform distillation, we sample an adjacent pair of latents (z1L ) {.} PDDT(x1L, ϵ1L), [δ, 1]} for {(z1L given step size δ [0, 1]. Here, z1L is noisier than z1L and serves as the input to the student model. Let xθ(z1L , s) and xθ(z1L , t) denote the output distributions over clean samples produced by the teacher and the student models, respectively. Following Deschenaux & Gulcehre (2024), we train the student by minimizing the KL divergence between these distributions: , z1L t LDCD(θ; θ) = DKL (xθ(z1L , t), xθ (z1L , s)) . (19) The distillation process proceeds in rounds, each consisting of training steps. At the end of each round, the teacher weights are updated with the current student weights. The full procedure is outlined in Algo. 1. 5. Experiments We evaluate Duo on standard language modeling benchmarks, training on LM1B (Chelba et al., 2014) and OpenWebText (OWT) (Gokaslan et al., 2019) with sequence packing (Raffel et al., 2020). We train our models for 1M steps with batch size of 512 on both datasets. For LM1B, we use context length of 128 with the bert-base-uncased tokenizer (Devlin et al., 2018) with sequence packing (Arriola et al., 2025; Austin et al., 2021) and without it (Sahoo et al., 2024a; Lou et al., 2023; He et al., 2022). For 6 Figure 2: Curriculum learning drastically lowers the gradient variance in Duo trained with fixed τ = 0.001. The figure shows the summed gradient variance of the 100 weights with the highest variance, comparing Duo with CL (blue) and without CL (grey). Hence, unlike prior discrete diffusion methods, we design the denoising model xθ L [0, 1] to handle both continuous latents and discrete latents; see Suppl. C.2 for details. During training, we sample U[β, γ]0β<γ1 from sub-interval so that αt [a, b]0a<b1. Following Arriola et al. (2025), we set < 1 as αt = 1 doesnt provide much training signal. Thus, we propose the following training loss: Ltrain = Ex,tU [β,γ],qt ℓ[L] fDuo (zℓ = arg max(wℓ t), xθ([softmax(wℓ /τ )]L ℓ=1, t), αt = (αt); xℓ). (17) This loss doesnt correspond to valid NELBO because the denoising model operates on continuous-time r.v., while the loss is defined for discrete diffusion process. It only becomes valid NELBO in the limiting case limτ 0+ with β = 0 and γ = 1. During evaluation, we evaluate the model as discrete diffusion model using (14). As shown in Figure 2 and Table 3, this approach results in lower training variance compared to previous MDMs and USDMs, ultimately improving model likelihood (Sec. 5.1). 4.2. Discrete Consistency Distillation In this section, we present new method to exploit the duality property of USDMs. This duality enables USDMs to adopt Consistency Distillationa technique developed for Gaussian diffusion models to distil them into few-step generation models. However, standard discrete diffusion models cannot use this approach due to the absence of such PF-ODEs. To address this, we introduce Discrete Consistency Distillation (DCD), which sidesteps this limitation by utilizing the PF-ODE of the underlying Gaussian diffusion model to construct deterministic trajectories. The Diffusion Duality Algorithm 1 Discrete Consistency Distillation (DCD) Input: Dataset D, learning rate η, number of distillation rounds , number of training iterations per round , ema µ, weights of the denoising model θ, weights of the EMA model θema, discretization step δ. for = 1 to do θ stopgrad(θ) for = 1 to do Sample x1L D, U[0, 1], and ϵℓ (0, IK). max(t δ, 0) z1L [arg max(αsxℓ + z1L [arg max(αtxℓ + LDCD(θ; θ) DKL(xθ(z1L θ θ ηθLDCD(θ; θ) θema stopgrad(µθema + (1 µ)θ) 2ϵℓ)]L 2ϵℓ)]L ℓ=1 , t), xθ (z1L 1 αs 1 αt , s)) ℓ=1 end for δ 2 δ end for return θema OWT, we use context length of 1024 with the GPT-2 tokenizer (Radford et al., 2019). Following Sahoo et al. (2024a), we reserve the last 100K documents for validation. Our model is 170M-parameter modified diffusion transformer (DiT) (Peebles & Xie, 2023) with rotary positional encoding (Su et al., 2023) and adaptive layer norm for conditioning on diffusion time, consistent with prior work (Lou et al., 2023; Sahoo et al., 2024a). Training is conducted on 8H100s with bfloat16 precision. We train Duo using (17), which requires computing the integral in (10). To reduce computation overhead, we pre-compute and cache 100K (αt, (αt)) tuples, significantly smaller than the denoising network. The Gaussian diffusion parameter αt is parameterized using linear schedule i.e., (αt = 1t)t[0,1]. 5.1. Improved Training Our experiments show that (1) the proposed curriculum learning strategy (Sec. 4.1.2) accelerates training by 2 and achieves new state-of-the-art among USDMs  (Table 1)  , and (2) Duo performs competitively with Absorbing State diffusion across major language modeling benchmarks, even surpassing AR models on 3/7 zero-shot PPL benchmarks  (Table 2)  . Experimental Setup The primary baselines for Duo are the leading USDMs (SEDD Uniform (Lou et al., 2023) and UDLM (Schiff et al., 2025)) and Gaussian diffusion method, PLAID (Gulrajani & Hashimoto, 2024). Additionally, we compare Duo with an AR model and MDMs such as MDLM (Sahoo et al., 2024a) (SOTA), SEDD Absorb (Lou et al., 2023), and D3PM Absorb (Austin et al., 2021). While training Duo, we set τ as function of the training iteration 7 for Duo: τ = 0.001 for the first 500K steps (n < 500K), and τ = 0 for the remaining steps up to 1M (n 500K). We use β = 0.03 and γ = 0.15 in (17) across all experiments. To compute PPL for Duo, we use (14) with αt = 1 t. Bias-variance Tradeoff First, we study the effect of τ on the training training dynamics in Fig. 8 by training Duo on the LM1B dataset over 150K steps with fixed τ {0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1}. Here, τ = 0 (blue) corresponds to (14), i.e., no curriculum. Recall that larger τ introduces more bias but reduces training variance. Ideally, τ should strike balanceminimizing both the bias (measured by deviation from the blue curve) and the variance in the loss curve. For τ = 0.1 (red), the loss drops sharply, indicating excessive bias, making it suboptimal. As τ decreases to 0.01 (orange) and 0.001 (purple), the loss curves become more stable. Among them, τ = 0.001 is the most desirable, as it closely follows the blue curve (low bias) while exhibiting significantly lower variance. Faster Training Notably, after just 10K steps of finetuning as discrete diffusion model i.e., at 510K steps, Duo achieves PPL of 35.2almost 1.5 points better than UDLM trained for 1M stepsindicating that curriculum learning accelerates convergence by at least 2. In Fig. 2, we compare the summed gradient variance of the top 100 weights with highest variance for Duo with (blue) and without (grey) curriculum. For these weights, we notice that curriculum learning reduces the gradient variance by an order of magnitude, which also manifests as lower loss variance in Fig. 7 and Table 3. Likelihood Evaluation On LM1B and OWT  (Table 1)  , Duo outperforms previous USDMs and Gaussian diffusion models, notably SEDD Uniform and UDLM and shrinks the gap with absorbing diffusion below 2 PPL points. On LM1B, We retrained Plaid which attained PPL of 89.9 in 100K steps while Duo achieves PPL of 43.0 in the same number of steps. This result is excluded from the table due to incomplete training; see Suppl. C.1 for details. Zero-Shot Likelihood Evaluation We measure the zeroshot generalization of the models trained on OWT by evaluating their PPL on 7 other datasets. Following Sahoo et al. (2024a), our zero-shot datasets include the validation splits of Penn Tree Bank (PTB; Marcus et al. (1993)), WikiText (Merity et al., 2016), LM1B, Lambada (Paperno et al., 2016), AG News (Zhang et al., 2015), and Scientific papers from ArXiv and Pubmed (Cohan et al., 2018). We observe that Duo outperforms SEDD Uniform and Plaid across all benchmarks. More notably, it achieves better PPL score than SEDD Absorbing on 4/7 datasets, MDLM on 1/7, most notably, outperforming an autoregressive transformer on 3/7 datasets. The Diffusion Duality Figure 4: Sample quality comparison between the base Duo model and Duo distilled for 5 rounds using our DCD algorithm. The distilled model matches the base models sample quality in just 16 steps (vs. 1024) with ancestral sampling. With our Greedy-Tail sampler, sampling steps can be further reduced to 8, achieving slightly better Gen PPL and lower entropy. vious diffusion models  (Fig. 9)  ; (2) combining DCD with the Greedy-Tail sampler reduces the number of sampling steps by two orders of magnitude  (Fig. 4)  ; and (3) the distilled Duo model outperforms distilled MDLM model, especially in the low NFE regime. Experimental Setup We distill Duo on OWT using DCD, following the same setup as our main baselineMDLM distilled with SDTT (Deschenaux & Gulcehre, 2024), distillation method for MDMs. We run = 5 distillation rounds, starting with discretization step δ = 1/512 in Algo. 1 and doubling it every = 10K steps. To assess sample quality, we report GPT-2 Large generative perplexity (Gen PPL) and average sequence entropy for diversity. As noted by Zheng et al. (2024), masked diffusion models can suffer from low diversity and misleading Gen PPL under lowprecision sampling. To address this, we use float64 precision in all sampling experiments. Sample Quality In Fig. 9, Duo consistently outperforms all MDMs and USDMs in Gen PPL across sampling steps {8, . . . , 1024}, with particularly strong performance at low NFEs. In Fig. 3, we compare Duo distilled with DCD to MDLM distilled with SDTT after 5 rounds (entropy values in parentheses). Under ancestral sampling, Duo performs significantly better than MDLM for 32. This is because MDMs generate many tokens independently and cannot revise them, leading to incoherence at low NFEs. In contrast, USDMs are self-correcting: they can fix earlier errors in later denoising steps. At higher NFEs, MDLM outperforms the distilled Duo. While MDLM (with SDTT) matches the Gen PPL of the AR model, its lower entropy (5.4 vs. 5.6) indicates reduced diversity. See Fig. 3 for performance over distillation rounds. Figure 3: Sample quality comparison of Duo vs. MDLM. Duo outperforms MDLM in Gen PPL () for base models and in low-NFE regime after 5 distillation rounds. Table 1: Test perplexities (PPL; ) on LM1B.

In Fig. 4, we observe that the ancestral sampler enables 64 speedup (reducing NFE from 1024 to 16) while maintaining Gen PPL. Greedy-Tail offers an even greater 128 speedup, with slight drop in entropy. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 11, each distillation round improves both Gen PPL and diversity when using the Greedy-Tail samplerunlike ancestral samplingsuggesting that GreedyTail is particularly effective for distilled models. Distillation for Faster Sampling Distillation in Gaussian diffusion leverages PF-ODEs (Luhman & Luhman, 2021; Salimans & Ho, 2022; Song et al., 2023), which are unavailable in discrete space. Our method circumvents this by defining PF-ODEs using an optimal denoiser in Gaussian space and mapping them to the discrete domain. In contrast, Deschenaux & Gulcehre (2024) tackle this issue by performing distillation along stochastic trajectories due to the lack of deterministic ones. We observe that our method Duo surpasses all previous approaches at few-step generation. Ablation In Algo. 1, we use the denoising model weights as the teacher, deviating from the common practice of using EMA weights in consistency models. To test this choice, we modify Algo. 1 to use EMA weights (Algo. 2) instead. As shown in Fig. 10, using the denoising model as directly leads to better distilled model. 6. Related Work Diffusion Language Models Prior work on discrete diffusion language models operates strictly in discrete space (Austin et al., 2021; Lou et al., 2023; Sahoo et al., 2024a; Schiff et al., 2025; Arriola et al., 2025). In contrast, we expand their design space by incorporating continuousstate Gaussian diffusion, showing that training USDMs in this setting not only accelerates convergence but also improves model likelihood. Li et al. (2022); Dieleman et al. (2022); Gulrajani & Hashimoto (2024) use Gaussian diffusion for language modeling by injecting noise into the continuous embeddings of discrete tokens. Duo takes different approach: it defines the diffusion process directly over one-hot token representations, rather than their embeddings. This hybrid treatment achieves better performance than methods confined to either domain alone. Argmax Differentiation The softmax annealing trick was originally proposed by Jang et al. (2017); Maddison et al. (2017) to enable backpropagation through an arg max operation. The core novelty of our work is in establishing fundamental connection between discrete and Gaussian diffusion via the arg max operator. We show that the softmax annealing trick can be naturally repurposed to design low-variance training curriculum for USDMs. 7. Conclusion In this work, we established theoretical connection between continuous-space Gaussian diffusion models and discrete-space Uniform-state diffusion models. We leveraged this connection to achieve 2 speed-up in training (Sec. 5.1) convergence and two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in sampling speed (Sec. 5.2). While USDMs trail MDMs in terms of perplexity, we showed that they outperform in few-step generation. We hope that our theoretical foundation opens up new avenues of future research which would leverage this connection to improve USDMs by borrowing techniques from Gaussian diffusiona connection non-existent for MDMs. 9 The Diffusion Duality"

            "content": "A. The Diffusion Duality Let s.t. xk = 1 i.e., contains 1 at the kth index. Consider r.v. = αtx+ σtϵ where ϵ (0, IK) and σt = 1 αt 2. A.1. Discrete Marginals Our goal in this section is to derive the pmf of the r.v. arg max(y). The proof has three parts. In part 1, we derive pdf of the the random variables yk and yik. Next in part 2, we derive the pdf of the random variable Zk = max({yi k}). Finally in part 3, we derive the distribution of max(Zk, yk) which is the key to constructing the pmf of the r.v. arg max(y). Part 1 It can be easily seen that every entry in is Gaussian r.v. with yk (αt, σ2 ) yik (0, σ2 ). (20) (21) Part 2 Since, yik follows Gaussian distribution with 0 mean and σt standard deviation, the probability of yik < where is (yik < l) = Φ ( σt ) (22) where Φ(z) = to compute the pdf of the r.v. Zk = max({yi k}) in the following manner: exp(t2/2)dz/ 2π is the cumulative distribution function of the Gaussian distribution. This allows us (Zk < l) = ΠikP (yi < l) = ΦK1 ( σt ) , (23) where (Zk < l) is the probability that Zk < for R. Part 3 Let (arg max(y)k = 1) denote the probability that the index is the index of the maximum entry in y. This is equal to the probability of every other entry yik < yk. Let ϕ(z) = exp(z2)/ 2π denote the standard Normal distribution. Hence, (arg max(y)k = 1) = (Zk < yk) The Diffusion Duality (Zk < l)P (yk = l)dl (Zk < l) [ 1 σt 1 σt σt ΦK1 (l) ϕ (l ΦK1 ( ) [ αt σt αt σt ) dl ϕ ( ϕ ( αt σt )] dl )] dl From (20) From (23) Substituting = l/σt ϕ (l αt 1 αt 2 ) ΦK1 (l) dl. (24) = = = = = Note that the indices and have the same probability of being the indices of maximum entry in because both r.v.s yik and yjk have the same pmf specified by (21). Thus, (arg max(y)ik = 1) = (arg max(y)jk = 1) 0 < K, 0 < K. (25) Thus we can compute (arg max(y)ik = 1) in the following manner: (arg max(y)i = 1) = 1 (cid:212) (arg max(y)k = 1) + ik (arg max(y)i = 1) = 1 (cid:212) (arg max(y)k = 1) + (K 1)P (arg max(y)ik = 1) = 1 From (25) (cid:212) (arg max(y)ik = 1) = (cid:212) (arg max(y)ik = 1) = 1 1 1 1 [1 (arg max(y)k = 1)] [1 ϕ (l αt 1 αt 2 ) ΦK1 (l) dl] From (24) (26) (27) (28) Let βt = (arg max(y)ik = 1). Then, from (24) and (26) we have (arg max(y)i=k = 1) = βt + (1 K)βt. Thus, (27) can be written in vectorized form in the following manner: (arg max(y)i = 1) = βt, βt + (1 K)βt. = (arg max(y)) = Cat(.; βt1 + (1 Kβt)x). A.2.

This pmf and the ODE are the unique signatures of Uniform-state discrete diffusion process (Lou et al., 2023; Schiff et al., 2025). This concludes our proof. A.3. Gaussian ELBO vs Discrete ELBO Let ws qt(.x) and wt qt(.x) be two intermediate latents for the Gaussian diffusion process defined on x. Let zs = arg max(ws) and zt = arg max(wt). Let q(ws, zswt, zt, x) denote the true joint reverse posterior and pθ(ws, zswt, zt) denote the approximate reverse joint posterior. Lets first derive some key relationships which will be helpful down the line. Since zt is deterministic transformation of wt, we get: q(wszs, wt, zt, x) = q(wszs, wt, x) pθ(wszs, wt, zt) = q(wszs, wt) Since the transition zt zs is Markov, we get: q(zswt, zt, x) = q(zszt, x) pθ(zswt, zt) = pθ(zszt) Since the transition wt ws is Markov, we get: Since zt = arg max(ws), we get: q(wswt, zt, x) = q(wswt, x) q(wswt, zt, x) = q(wswt, x) 16 (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) The Diffusion Duality pθ(wswt, zt) = pθ(wswt) Since zs = arg max(ws), we get: q(zsws, wt, zt, x) = q(zsws) = Cat(.; arg max(ws)) pθ(zsws, wt, x) = q(zsws, wt, zt, = xθ) = q(zsws) Using (41) The can simplify DKL(q(ws, zswt, zt, x)pθ(ws, zswt, zt)) in two different ways. The first way is: DKL(q(ws, zswt, zt, x)pθ(ws, zswt, zt)) = zs ws = zs ws q(ws, zswt, zt, x) log q(ws, zswt, zt, x) pθ(ws, zswt, zt) dws q(wszs, wt, zt, x)q(zswt, zt, x) log q(wszs, wt, zt, x)q(zswt, zt, x) pθ(wszs, wt, zt)pθ(zswt, zt) dws Using (33, 34, 35, 36), we get: = zs ws q(wszs, wt, x)q(zszt, x) log q(wszs, wt, x)q(zszt, x) pθ(wszs, wt)pθ(zszt) dws = Ezs DKL(q(wszs, wt, x)pθ(wszs, wt)) + DKL(q(zszt, x)pθ(zszt)) The second way is: DKL(q(ws, zswt, zt, x)pθ(ws, zswt, zt)) = ws = ws zs zs q(ws, zswt, zt, x) log q(ws, zswt, zt, x) pθ(ws, zswt, zt) dws q(zsws, wt, zt, x)q(wswt, zt, x) log q(wswt, zt, x)q(zsws, wt, zt, x) pθ(wswt, zt)pθ(zsws, wt, zt) dws Using (38, 39), we get: = ws zs q(zsws, wt, zt, x)q(wswt, x) log q(wswt, x)q(zsws, wt, zt, x) pθ(wswt)pθ(zsws, zt) dws (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) Using (41, 42), we get: = q(wswt, x)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24) q(zsws) pθ(wswt)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24) q(zsws) Given ws, zs = arg max(ws) is the only possible value; hence, q(zsws)q(wswt, x) log zs ws dws = ws = ws q(zs = arg max(ws)ws)q(wswt, x) log q(wswt, x) pθ(wswt) dws q(wswt, x) log q(wswt, x) pθ(wswt) dws = DKL(q(wswt, x)pθ(wswt)) (44) From (43) and (44) we get DKL(q(wswt, x)p(wswt)) = Ezt[EzsDKL(q(wszs, wt, x)p(wszs, wt))] 0 +DKL(q(zszt, x)p(zszt)) (cid:212) DKL(q(wswt, x)p(wswt)) DKL(q(zszt, x)p(zszt)) (cid:212) DKL(q(wswt, x)p(wswt)) ELBO(qt,pθ)(7) DKL(q(zszt, x)p(zszt)) ELBO(qt,pθ)(5) 17 The Diffusion Duality (cid:212) ELBO(qt, pθ; x) ELBO(qt, pθ; x) (cid:212) log pθ(x) ELBO(qt, pθ; x) ELBO(qt, pθ; x) (45) Thus, ELBO in the Gaussian space is looser or lower than the ELBO in the discrete space. This proof is inspired by Mena et al. (2018). A.4. Negative Evidence Lower Bound Schiff et al. (2025) showt that the NELBO for USDMs is given as: where is defined as: NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],qt(ztx;αt) f(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt; x), f(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt; x) = αt Kαt xi (xθ)i xj xi log (xθ)i xj (xθ)j xi . (46) (47) where the subscript denotes the ith index of vector, = Kαtx + (1 αt)1, xθ = Kαtxθ(zt, t) + (1 αt)1, αt the time-derivative of the αt, and we define = arg maxj[K](zt)j to be the non-zero entry of zt. denotes Rao Blackwellized NELBO (Ours) To reduce GPU memory usage and training time, we rewrite the original ELBO objective in (47) by eliminating the need to explicitly materialize the one-hot vector x. This leads to more efficient formulation that preserves fidelity while significantly improving practicality. The resulting objective, shown in (48), not only removes but also applies Rao-Blackwellization to analytically compute certain expectations, thereby reducing variance. We now derive the improved loss: fDuo(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt; x) = = αt Kαt αt Kαt xi xi (xθ)i (xθ)i s.t. (zt)j =0 s.t. (zt)j =0 ( ( xj xi xj xi Let κt = (1 αt)/(Kαt + 1 αt), ) log ( (xθ)i xj (xθ)j xi ) . ) log ( (xθ)i (xθ)j ) s.t. (zt)j =0 ( xj xi ) log ( xj xi ) s.t. (zt)j =0 xj xi = αt Kαt xi (xθ)i ( xj xi ) log (xθ)i (xθ)j ((K 1)κt1zt=x 1 κt 1ztx) log κt αt Kαt xi (xθ)i = Let denote the index in corresponding to 1, i.e., xm = 1, ) log ( (xθ)i (xθ)j ((K 1)κt1zt=x 1 κt 1ztx) log κt = αt Kαt xi (xθ)i (κt1zt=x + 1ztx) log (xθ)i (xθ)j αt 1 αt log (xθ)i (xθ)m 1ztx ((K 1)κt1zt=x 1 κt 1ztx) log κt . (48) This reformulation provides an efficient and low-variance formula for computing the NELBO for USDMs while maintaining minimal memory overhead. The final expression is as follows: NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],qt(ztx;αt) fDuo(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt; x), (49) where fDuo is defined in (48). As sanity check, we empirically verify the equivalence between (46) and (49). Specifically, we train Duo on LM1B with sentence-packing  (Table 1)  using our proposed Rao-Blackwellized NELBO (49). We then evaluate the model using the inefficient NELBO (46) as proposed by Schiff et al. (2025), and recover the same perplexity (33.7). 18 The Diffusion Duality (a) Autoregressive Model (b) Masked Diffusion (c) Uniform-state Diffusion (d) PDDT Figure 5: Comparison of generative processes in various discrete sequence models; see Suppl. A.5 for detailed discussion. (a) Autoregressive Model: Tokens are generated sequentially, one at time, from left to right. (b) Masked Diffusion: Once unmasked, token remains fixed, though multiple tokens may be denoised simultaneously at each step. (c) Uniform-state Diffusion: Tokens can visit several intermediate states during the diffusion process. (d) DDT: Similar to USDMs, generation begins with sequence of randomly initialized tokens. However, once token flips, it remains fixed throughout the reverse generation process. Thus, the generation process closely resembles to that of MDMs. A.5. Reverse Process Visualizations Figure 5 illustrates the differences among four diffusion processes: autoregressive models (which can be viewed as form of left-to-right diffusion), masked diffusion, uniform diffusion, and Duo with Discrete Consistency Distillation (DCD). Each method demonstrates distinct pattern of token evolution during generation. Autoregressive Models Autoregressive models generate tokens one at time, sequentially from left to right. At each forward pass of the neural network, single token is produced, which limits the throughput. Finally, tokens are not revised once they have been generated. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) In masked diffusion, all tokens in the original sequence are masked, when at the highest noise level, and are progressively unmasked throughout the diffusion process until the data sequence is fully denoised. Hence each token can take on only one of two possible values. Uniform-state Diffusion Models (USDMs) Uniform-state diffusion models allow tokens to be updated at every diffusion step, using uniform prior over the vocabulary. In contrast to autoregressive or masked models, each token can be updated multiple times throughout the diffusion process. 1 αt t=1]L ℓ=1 = [arg max(αtxℓ + DDT This reprsents deterministic trajectory between the clean data x1L and sample from the uniform prior: ℓ=1 for ϵℓ (0, IK) ℓ [L]. As shown in (18), the value of each to- [zℓ ken at the ℓth position at an intermediate timestep is given by arg max(αtxℓ + 2ϵℓ). This expression represents the arg max of linear interpolation between xℓthe one-hot vector of the clean dataand the Gaussian noise vector ϵℓ, both of which remain fixed throughout the entire generation process. Consequently, the intermediate token can take on only one of two values: xℓ (when is close to 0) or arg max(ϵℓ) (when is close to 1). The generation process closely resembles to that of MDMs where token once denoised, cant change. This is called the carry over operation in MDMs (Sahoo 2ϵℓ)]L 1 αt 19 et al., 2024a). Please note that the PDDT is only used during distillation to generate the teacher and student targets Alg.(1) and that Duo isnt trained to generate samples with carry over: i.e. once token changes, it never changes again. The Diffusion Duality B. Additional Proofs B.1. ELBO Equivalence We have already established that Uniform-state discrete diffusion process has an underlying Gaussian diffusion process qt. The diffusion parameters of the Gaussian process, denoted αt, and those of the Uniform-state discrete diffusion process, denoted (αt), are related through the diffusion transformation operator ; see (10). Using this relationship and the result from (9), we can express the NELBO for USDMs as: NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],qt(ztx;αt) fDuo(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt; x), and equivalently in terms of the Gaussian diffusion parameters αt, as: NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],Pt(ztx;T ( αt)) fDuo(zt, xθ(zt, t), αt = (αt); x). (50) (51) From (9) and (12), we also know that Pt (ztx; (αt)) = [arg max] qt(wtx; αt). Substituting this into (51), we obtain: NELBO (q, pθ; x) = EtU [0,1],qt(wtx; αt) fDuo(zt = arg max(wt), xθ(arg max(wt), t), αt = (αt); x). (52) (52) shows that the NELBO for USDMs can be equivalently computed using the latents of the corresponding Gaussian diffusion process. We now extend this equivalence to sequences. Starting from (50) and (52), we have: NELBO(q, pθ; x1L) = t,qt(z1L x1L;αt) ℓ[L] fDuo(zℓ t, xℓ θ(z1L , t), αt; xℓ) = t,qt(w1L x; αt) ℓ[L] fDuo (zℓ = arg max(wℓ t), xθ ([arg max(wℓ )]L ℓ=1, t) , αt = (αt); xℓ) . (53) (54) This concludes our proof. As sanity check, we empirically verify the equivalence of (53) and (54). To do this, we trained Duo on LM1B with sentence-packing  (Table 1)  using the true ELBO from (53). We then evaluated the model using Gaussian latents and (54), and recovered the same PPL (33.7) as when using discrete latents. For each datapoint x, we used 1000 Monte Carlo samples for sampled using antithetic-sampling, with linear schedule for αt = 1 t. B.2. Discrete Consistency Distillation B.2.1. OPTIMAL GAUSSIAN PF-ODES For Gaussian diffusion process (see Sec. 2.2), the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) can be reversed using the DDIM sampler (Song et al., 2021), whose update step is given by: zs = αsxθ(zt, t) + 1 αs 2ϵθ(zt, t) (55) where < t, xθ RK [0, 1] is the denoising model, and ϵθ(zt, t) = (zt αtxθ(zt, t))/ 1 αt 2. Assuming an optimal denoiser such thatxθ(zt, t) = xt [0, 1], and given zt=1 = ϵ (0, IK) and qdata, (55) simplifies to This holds [0, 1]. Thus, the optimal PF-ODE trajectory PODE(x, ϵ) is given as: zs = αtx + 1 αt 2ϵ PODE(x, ϵ) = {αtx + 1 αt 2ϵ} . t[0,1] 20 (56) (57) The Diffusion Duality Algorithm 2 Discrete Consistency Distillation (DCD) with EMA as teacher Input: Dataset D, learning rate η, number of distillation rounds K, number of training iterations per round , ema µ, weights of the denoising model θ, weights of the EMA model θema, discretization step δ. for = 1 to do θ stopgrad(θema) Only difference w.r.t the standard DCD algorithm (Alg. 1). for = 1 to do Sample x1L D, U[0, 1], and ϵℓ (0, IK). max(t δ, 0) z1L [arg max(αsxℓ + z1L [arg max(αtxℓ + LDCD(θ; θ) DKL(xθ(z1L θ θ ηθLDCD(θ; θ) θema stopgrad(µθema + (1 µ)θ) 2ϵℓ)]L 2ϵℓ)]L ℓ=1 , t), xθ (z1L 1 αs 1 αt , s)) ℓ=1 end for δ 2 δ end for Output: θema We can easily extend this to sequences: PODE(x1L, ϵ1L) = {[αtxℓ + 1 αt B.2.2. DCD ABLATION 2ϵℓ]L ℓ=1} t[0,1] (58) Typically, consistency models use the EMA (exponential moving average) parameters of the denoising model as the teacher (Sec. 2.3). In contrast, our proposed distillation algorithm uses the denoising model weights from the previous distillation round as the teacher. We ablate this design choice in Alg. 2 by instead using the EMA weights of the denoising model obtained during pre-training as the teacher. This modification leads to degraded performance, as shown in Fig. 10 and Table 6. C. Experimental details C.1. Plaid Baseline For PLAID on LM1B, we retrained it without self-conditioning (Chen et al., 2023) to match our denoising models parameter count. While self-conditioning improves PPL and can be applied to both discrete and Gaussian diffusion models, we omit it for consistency with baselines such as MDLM, SEDD, UDLM, and D3PM. Since higher training precision benefits discrete diffusion models (Shi et al., 2025), we use bfloat16 for the forward pass through the denoising model while keeping float64 for other computations to stabilize PLAID training. Due to their inefficient open-source codebase1, we report PLAID results for LM1B at 100K steps, as further training was infeasible. For OWT, we report results from Lou et al. (2023), where PLAID was trained at higher precision for 1.3M steps, favoring the baseline. C.2. Denoising Model Unlike prior discrete diffusion approaches, we design the denoising model xθ [0, 1] to operate on both continuous latents yc1L and discrete latents yd1L L. We implement xθ as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), where token embeddings in the first layer are computed via matrix multiplication: (yℓ c) ℓ[L]vocab_embeddings with vocab_embeddings RKm denoting the vocabulary embedding matrix and the embedding dimension. For c)ℓ[L] act d)ℓ[L] V, we perform standard embedding lookups. In contrast, continuous inputs (yℓ discrete inputs (yℓ as soft lookups, producing convex combination of the vocabulary embeddings. 1https://github.com/igul222/plaid 21 C.3. Low Discrepancy Sampler The Diffusion Duality To reduce variance during training we use low-discrepancy sampler, similar to that proposed Kingma et al. (2021). Specifically, when processing minibatch of samples, instead of independently sampling from uniform distribution, we partition the unit interval and sample the time step for each sequence {1, . . . , } from different portion of the interval ti [ i1 ]. This ensures that our sampled timesteps are more evenly spaced across the interval [0, 1], reducing the variance of the ELBO. , C.4. Likelihood Evaluation We use single monte-carlo estimate for to evaluate the likelihood. We use low discrepancy sampler (Kingma et al., 2021) to reduce the variance of the estimate. We evaluate likelihood using the true ELBO, not the curriculum learning objective. C.5. Language Modeling We detokenize the One Billion Words dataset following Lou et al. (2023); Sahoo et al. (2024a), whose code can be found here2. We tokenize the One Billion Words dataset with the bert-base-uncased tokenizer, following He et al. (2022). We concatenate and wrap sequences to length of 128 (Raffel et al., 2020). We tokenize OpenWebText with the GPT2 tokenizer. We concatenate and wrap them to length of 1,024. When wrapping, we add the eos token in-between concatenated sequences. Since OpenWebText does not have validation split, we leave the last 100k docs as validation. We parameterize our autoregressive baselines, UDLM, SEDD, and MDLM with the modified diffusion transformer architecture (Peebles & Xie, 2023) from Lou et al. (2023); Sahoo et al. (2024a). We use 12 layers, hidden dimension of 768, 12 attention heads, and timestep embedding of 128 for the uniform diffusion models (SEDD Uniform, UDLM, Duo). Word embeddings are not tied between the input and output. We train the SEDD and MDLM baselines using the original code provided by their authors. We use the AdamW optimizer with batch size of 512, constant learning rate warmup from 0 to learning rate of 3e-4 for 2,500 steps. We use constant learning rate for 1M, 5M, or 10M steps on One Billion Words, and 1M steps for OpenWebText. We use dropout rate of 0.1. C.6. Zeroshot Likelihood We evaluate zeroshot likelihoods by taking the models trained on OpenWebText and evaluating likelihoods on the validation splits of 7 datasets: Penn Tree Bank (PTB; Marcus et al. (1993)), Wikitext (Merity et al., 2016), One Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (LM1B; Chelba et al. (2014)), Lambada (Paperno et al., 2016), AG News (Zhang et al., 2015), and Scientific Papers (Pubmed and Arxiv subsets; Cohan et al. (2018)). We detokenize the datasets following Lou et al. (2023). For the AG News and Scientific Papers (Pubmed and Arxiv), we apply both the Wikitext and One Billion Words detokenizers. Since the zeroshot datasets have different conventions for sequence segmentation, we wrap sequences to 1024 and do not add eos tokens in between sequences. C.7. Curriculum Learning , so when We visualize the diffusion parameter αt in Fig. 6. As shown in (48), the diffusion NELBO is weighted by αt 0, the contribution of diffusion time step to the NELBO becomes negligible, offering little learning signal. Prior αt work (Sahoo et al., 2024a; Lou et al., 2023) used linear schedule for αt and did not face this issue. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that for [β, γ], the Gaussian latent retains higher signal level than its discrete counterpart, making it easier for the denoising model to recover the clean signal, as discussed in Sec. 4.1.2. To mitigate these issues, we restrict the training window to [β, γ] in (17) when training on Gaussian latents, thereby 0. For the discrete diffusion process, we set the time range such that αt = (αt) avoiding the region where αt [0.05, 0.95]. While this range depends on the vocabulary size K, we found it to be similar for both the gpt-2 and bert-base-uncased tokenizers, corresponding to [β, γ] = [0.03, 0.15]. Although this introduces slight bias in the 2https://github.com/louaaron/Score-Entropy-Discrete-Diffusion/blob/main/data.py The Diffusion Duality Figure 6: Diffusion transformation operator (αt) (10) for the bert-base-uncased tokenizer. NELBO estimate, it significantly reduces training variance. C.8. Distillation Experiments To compare distilled Duo with SDTT, we distill an MDLM on LM1B for 5 rounds of 10k training steps with batch size of 128 and learning rate of 6.0e 05. We linearly increase the learning rate for 500 steps and hold it constant for the rest of training. These hyperparameters correspond to the original SDTT recipe of Deschenaux & Gulcehre (2024). D. Additional Experiments D.1. Gradient Variance and Loss Variance Refer Table 3. Table 3: Curriculum learning drastically lowers the gradient variance in Duo trained with fixed τ = 0.001.

Thats why it was festive day for them,\" he said.

Arconditude to profit Violence over the shops did not immediately turn into NDB \"terror operation\", said Kazika Shiva Dwarrang, campaigner with Umlima Banda Organizations (AWOA) outfits in North Kuala Lumpur. \"I would never go with 100-fold order. But after the standoff with the shop and if there are conditions, there will undoubtedly be more police operations as long as it is simply not illegal,\" she told NTN. The lesson may be that more people including NDB (President) Chai Carr are getting rich through power producers whose power generators rely on diesel fuel to secure energy supplies. The administration in its Public Sector Payment Area (PPSA) last year plans to reduce the electricity supply of generators on the grid. This mode of electricity service and radiantenergy runoff has been depleted. But Chais enthusiasm to replace it this year is over, which takes lot of time, and could produce some promising gains for Asias poor, from climate-change poverty alleviation. Twe-han Ni Mel Lin, with PHNL (band CEO and consultant) Consolidated Power Company, hopes the project will be completed by 2020.\"The national government will be built on system that can integrate the production system which will also contribute to creating reliable energy mix,\" Yongyata Kluors coal minister, said at conference later this month. Besides solar, commercial battery plants are battery, even the worlds most advanced nuclear plants are taking advantage of that system to generate power. Demand is dependent on coal and drives the economies of two cradle-cradle low production nations. \"These economic realities will bring global wealth to the developing world. They will become poorer by buying electricity only,\" he said. This dependence will also drive prices because people face higher food prices from time to time and low incomes.

Last Wednesday, jury in Sarasota, Florida, overturned Governor George Zimmermans trial in which 14-year-old female had tried to penetrate her after the argument. The former entertainer claimed innocence, pointing it out that he had no specifics with court agents to the contrary. \"Theres no way such illicit relationship intercourse or activity would have not occurred with her while did what she did and... had nothing happened with me,\" the verdict read. Palin balked at the lawyers claim that she was having sex because he didnt see her because of the ninth-degree day and that he didnt need to and leave her alone. This perception was caused by the incident: Martin had told Florida officials he couldnt stray too away from his wife by \"speaking to her like her eight-year-old daughter is.\" Palin also stopped short of any panicked reactions when she joined debate on MSNBC, where she finished second in-place ahead of Gingrich. \"Theres fundamental misunderstanding in our society about folks in some of the situations that theyre in, feel those comments are not the fault of the commentators,\" she said. \"I quibble with them wouldve made two weeks ago.\" Fox sent statement to state Sen. Bobby Jindal that suggested Palin was unfair to women suggesting \"that some of this behavior is justified because there is no justification for such thing.\" Texas Rep. Cheri Bonnington echoed the hosts comments. Palin took the issue quickly, but said she felt she was empowered to do her job. The self-described conservative and libertarian said that women usually just dont believe men should be punished over its use or violence. \"They know that they are allowing their fellow men to bark,\" she said. \"They will do it, and youre not going to give you trouble. Its like we have hard reckoning in our own good or private lives about how we should act.\" Former Sen. John McCain also defended her during her tenure as president, speaking about the need to discipline the personnel. \"They still practice argumentative talk to make it so hard for women to win,\" he even said in an address said to have been pushback from the wives. Barney W. Bush, on the other hand, also defended Palin, his running mate and said the media should paid attention to \"the way language was used.\" Bush also pointed to the possibility of condemnation of the campaigns which he was unable to discuss.

Outside of the administration, Republicans are fighting to combat same-sex marriage. Immediately, when the issue was announced, Senate Republicans had decided \"to speak on this,\" outside the party. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), the ranking member of the House Republican Study Committee, convinced Ted Cruz to make bold statement on the issue earlier this month. ADVERTISEMENT \"Look forward to the matters of today; theyve been decided over the floor, on the floor,\" Sen. Cruz said, addressing same-sex marriage, saying in an opening statement briefingly explaining the House majoritys earlier in May.\" Cruzs remarks were inspired by \"a poll asking questions from adults between the ages 16 and 17. While one third, 17 people think traditional marriage should be at odds with or opposed to marriage.\" The statement delved into whether and who holds that view. And the study is significant: just few weeks ago, President Trump promised to strike down the issue. So they talk about what they have to do is equate them with views \"that others consider same and wrong.\" \"Meighing views?\" Cruzs language. \"Global Politics, Gender and Traversus versus What is regression to construct society against all non-gender genders, regardless of their sex and status?\" Mohn wrote in Facebook.

Batting to avoid any additional pressure by ministers or personal hookers, Cameron got out late to claim that Somerset is key target for Labour in the election.

In 2014, Boston continued to appear on the electoral map despite the results. The survey run by the Mori poll says these claims of missed opportunity, puts the evidence evenly across both. For decades there has been evidence that Labour was either really tied to the election or environment economic chaos, although the Sutton report as result shows this, Tony Blair prepared result pulled from the Communication WorkersEC, and, after complicated of successful pressure, the party emerged as key figure in its campaign to form the coalition. The difference may not represent potentially the only point to coalition deal, and suggests suggests it may have represented shareless factor in the post-election calculations.

PPL 193.05 and entropy = 5.58 35 The Diffusion Duality <endoftext> legislation. Much to the dismay of the American Civil Liberties Union, President Bush sent joint letter to Congress, consulting with the body in deciding whether to strip surveillance of surveillance authority. The Congress had objected to Conservative motion to remove their amendment from consideration, but failed to pass the bill, due to sheer procedural errors that were not addressed in the final version. The other members of the mainline denomination, the United Methodist Church also introducing the legislation, signed on November 2, 2002, after the 1898 American Revolution. The compromise comes within process based upon the expression of the First Amendment rights of the Constitution and the Fourth Amendment of the United States. (The Libertarians uphold the right of state officials to lawful activities by foreign governments as defined by the Geneva Conventions, before advancing to the question of the dangers that arise from this practice.) While these concerns are indeed obvious to Americans that identify with their allegiance to Americas government, they seem to reflect position that cannot be explained based entirely on the participation of Americans in the enforcement of the law, and their cooperation with Americas government. Imminent surveillance, is difficult to dispute, either by whole or part of the American populace. Almost any technique that is ever [redacted] for it will be completely likely to violate the privacy and general security of Americans, as far as know, far more than effective surveillance methods. Such technique will have to give up lot of information, and it will be difficult to develop techniques, informants, and other methods that can begin to expose persons electronic and legal communications far beyond last years. welcome few additional comments on this particular point, and will be addressing them in the future. First, we are very surprised by the fact that so many of them, and so many our police officers, are in this position. The information that we have gathered is very clear. We know about us intimately, that we are very sensitive, that they are very constrained, as well as about the limitations of what they are doing. We are not only representing them, we know of us, and that our knowledge of them is valuable, and we are doing our best to make them the most difficult and difficult next step as possible. It is possible that this is limited surveillance state, much like what we would be subjected to, but that if the program led to significant increase in surveillance, it would be labeled as cyber routers and phones. Some have commented that the filters are still sufficient to curbing this process, but they constitute confounding, in that it would be very difficult for such an assessment to begin with computerized seed; that documents available to the eyes of the general public would be unviewable; and that the risk would be inevitable that anyone who under certain circumstances could have access immediately to this superstate. also think that such access will not be recognized as begrap, and therefore as repeated violation of the law, and the government will not want to do so, either. But it can almost certainly be seen by some of this reader, that such superstate state is almost always, intuitively, very hard to reach very quickly, and something that we need to do to finally confront threats at serious level. If they are allowed to remain so, their consequences will be determined as having the highest possible impact if we are to stabilize the power grid in the future. The aforementioned congress address also made it crystal clear, we wanted process that required analysis of all the information that was sent and received by the American population, and, one hopes therefore, absolutely to see the fate of humanity decide the way of larger society. Unfortunately, there are many, many more of these that continue to leak into the Prism program. That means that we would have much more likely surveillance as nation also, and thus much more likely that it would be related to the above-mentioned civil law enforcement force, or actually related to the violation of international human rights laws. Accordingly, according to the UN statistics, 30-34 major reported cybernet attacks have occurred in at least 29 countries in the developing world currently, primarily those conducted by MIT or China, and the aforementioned major cybernet attacks in these countries will continue to be suffering in systematic and severe instances, which regard the violation of basic human rights and brutal abuse of cyber enclaves from outside civilization as an important issue. At this point, along with the actual global threats that are prevalent in all aspects of our lives, many factors have impacted the relationship between the Internet and our societies and its general use. Indeed, the grinder contributes to tremendous threat to the Internet because it is one of the tools that great majority of people actually use.

Finally, this is, of course, complicated by the differences among individual species with respect to taxonomy. Although the ways in which individuals in some cases differ substantially in the overall value of family members, some differ by variation in other variablesor vice versaand thus statistical analysis can not be helped by the extent to which traits differ between two assemblies in many cases, and cannot say something on the contrary about having equal characteristics in all. Within the group. The only dispute about the similarity between the structure of one of groups to the similarity between one of the imports depending on the genetic diversity, is whether there is difference between the characteristics and features of those three groups. The first response would be to affirm that the argument is that similarity exists purely between group and those whose own varieties and varieties, like the two versions of other groups, are all distinct in the same domain. But, in some cases, or all of the cases, explaining the distinction would require very simple explanation of how the distinction is understood. Of course, this hypothesis would be major objection to having any real evidence (Hein, 1993). An attempt to define the degree of similarity between any of those groups might show that, in fact, they are clearly the most dominant, with similarities occurring competitively. The point is that the data on the respective varieties and varieties are not easy to understand. It would be possible to show examples of each group of different varieties and varieties used in natural sciences; this means at the bare minimum that, for each, each of the groups uses the particular natural systems they are based in. Just because it would be possible to make claim in given domain isnt because the conclusions are generalisable to each individual, it is not because each individual is likely to reach uniform political or personal conclusion, and it is not because it is possible to prove that even this is not the case. And it is not so easy for it to be useful for making claim in one domain, not necessarily to show that different domain is equally important. In this sense, the lack of adequate general principles provided by statistics are evident in very direct way that the differences between different sets of individual groups can have been naturalised only by formal simulations of the two groups and no quantitative requirements for the corresponding values in each kind of grouping. The fact that there is an attribute between three distinct biological classes does not mean that they have all of the exact same characteristics, and it does not imply that all three groups are equally. It is true that the different classes may be comparable in many respects, but it is misleading to assert that this does not mean to say that all two categories have the same comparative advantage. And it does mean that just to say the least, however, this hypothesis does not mean that particular class has the primary advantage against different class. In fact, this hypothesis does not mean that there is primary difference. And it does not claim that it is true that each other species possesses the basic same characteristics, nor that neither does the class have any general principle of advantages or disadvantages over the other. model. Rather, this means that class as such is not only relevant, but more precisely, not irrelevant whether or not it becomes relevant. For example, we know that model retains its advantages in the other domain, and that the ability to select for very specific class typically has as few advantages as an actual class possesses. This fact, along with the fact that varies in Darwinian categories, would undermine the modern observation that information such as the difference between an intranet or well-performed telephone offers very specific choice based on location. It doesnt explain the nature of the grid in terms of how it operates, and, even when its assertions are widely accepted, the quality of the information now available to verify its truth is not present to me. One of the key problems with the most important differences between different varieties and varieties is what or how they actually do in the other domains. The most important aspects of these differences are not understood as strictly cultural ones, and knowledge of the particulars of variation such as this does not only affect advantages attained in different domains (a real phenomenon for virtually all of the relevant domains), but also the artificial camouflage of similarities, and the intrinsic difficulties in theories that mirror pictures of the characteristics that are performed by each variation. Genetics is another type of variation, and an important set of limitations upon the field of the natural sciences and the larger publics attention. The empirical reasons for this limitation include that it does not really matter if conditions are changed or not; rather, it is simply mechanism by which features are different in different other natural systems, and also in different samples, and also mean that in many cases, there are only very few combinations chosen individually. The difference is that this fact cannot be examined in almost any representative<endoftext> Figure 20: Samples (T = 1024) from MDLM trained on OWT and distilled using SDTT with Gen.
