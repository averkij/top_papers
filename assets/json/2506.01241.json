            "content": "There is growing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) to specialized applications that demand domain-specific expertise, such as student tutoring [1], legal case summarization [2], and medical diagnosis [3]. These expert-level tasks pose greater challenges because they require specialized knowledge and strict adherence to domain-specific standards, which are typically acquired Co-first authors. *Correspondance to {jieruan,inair,caoshuy,wangluxy}@umich.edu Preprint. through advanced education and professional experience. Furthermore, many real-world expertlevel tasks require understanding lengthy inputs [4] and generating complex and nuanced long-form outputs [5, 6]. Existing expert-level benchmarks such as MMLU [7] and GPQA [8] prioritize ease of evaluation of multiple-choice or short-form answers at the expense of alignment with realistic expert applications. Though ExpertQA [9] assesses longer-form, domain-specific outputs, it remains centered on QA scenarios rather than end-to-end expert workflows. In addition to task scope, key limitation is the lack of evaluation methods tailored to the specific requirements of each task. WildBench [10] creates checklists to evaluate model responses to user queries, yet their model-generated checklists fall short in capturing domain-specific requirements, which often demand expert knowledge to construct. Finally, broader challenge is the lack of reference outputs in expert-level benchmarks with long-form responses, leading to ungrounded evaluations and oversight of recall estimation. To address these gaps, this paper first introduces EXPERTLONGBENCH, multi-disciplinary, expertlevel benchmark with tasks that require long-form outputs. EXPERTLONGBENCH comprises 11 tasks across 9 domains, including law, material science, education, healthcare, chemistry, biology, medicine, finance, and cybersecurity, with 1050 samples in total (Tab. 1). Our benchmark enables more comprehensive assessment of models problem-solving capabilities by including domainspecific end-to-end applications, such as drafting legal briefs or clinical notes, with maximum input and output lengths exceeding 200K and 5K tokens, significantly longer than existing datasets (see comparison in Appendix H). The completion of these tasks is time-consuming, even for human experts. For example, it takes over 10 hours for proficient legal practitioner to summarize complex legal case, as they need to follow the docket and review tens to hundreds of court filings [5]. Moreover, EXPERTLONGBENCH provides expert-written reference outputs for each task, facilitating grounded evaluation. Figure 1: Pipeline of CLEAR. The example shown is from task T1: multi-document legal case summarization. The checklist mapper takes as input the model output (or human-written reference) and extracts checklist items according to the rubric. Checklists of the model output and the reference are compared at the item level, and the results are subsequently aggregated into the final scores of precision, recall, F1, and accuracy. To ensure more accurate evaluation of model performance on expert-level tasks, we further propose CLEARCheckList-based Expert-level Assessment with Rubric  (Fig. 1)  . We collaborate with domain experts to develop and validate detailed evaluation rubric for each task. Unlike subjective criteria, such as usefulness [9] and helpful information [10], our rubric specifies the essential elements required in the output for each application, enabling fine-grained evaluation that closely align with domain-specific requirements. For example, well-written summary of legal case documents intended for lawyers must accurately identify the cause of action, the relevant statutory or constitutional basis, and the remedy sought. Based on the rubric, CLEAR breaks down model 2 Table 1: Benchmark statistics. : rubric is developed by experts; otherwise, it is created by refining and expanding upon established evaluation protocols; : task data is held privately. For each task, we report whether the task data is newly created () or adapted from previous work; the average number of checklist items in each sample (#Rubric); and the average length of the input (#Input) and human reference (#Reference). Several of these tasks feature significantly longer inputs and references compared to existing domain-specific datasets (see Appendix H).

For each item, our framework compares the corresponding information extracted from the models output against that of the reference output, thereby ensuring grounded and objective checklist-based assessment.1 We evaluate the performance of 11 frontier LLMs on EXPERTLONGBENCH, including both openweight and proprietary model families. Our findings are: The best model achieves an average F1 score of 26.8% across all tasks, revealing that the end-to-end expert-level tasks in EXPERTLONGBENCH present significant challenges for existing LLMs. Despite low overall output quality, models can generate content that matches over 67% of the aspects required in the checklist, suggesting risk of models producing content that appears expert-aligned but is potentially misleading due to incorrect generation. CLEAR can be configured with open-weight models for cost-effective and scalable benchmarking, as evidenced by Pearson correlation of 0.88 between the scores assigned by Qwen2.5-72B and GPT-4o for checklist-based evaluation."

            "content": "Evaluating LLMs on Expert-Level Knowledge. Previous studies have assessed domain-specific knowledge using multiple-choice questions (e.g., MMLU [7], GPQA [8]) or short-answer questions (e.g., AGIEval [11], SciEval [12], HLE [13], OlympiadBench [14]). Their scope remains constrained to exam-style questions, failing to reflect domain-specific tasks in real world that typically require long-form generation. ExpertQA curates open-ended questions written by domain experts [9]. However, the answers to these questions are typically around 100 words, as the questions are formulated to address experts specific knowledge queries rather than addressing the full scope of an end-to-end workflow. Additionally, the evaluation method relies on human judgments of answer usefulness, which are inherently subjective, coarse-grained, and lack scalability. EXPERTLONGBENCH addresses these gaps by introducing diverse, expert-level tasks that align with complete workflows; incorporating tasks requiring long-form generation and featuring lengthy inputs that are typical in practical use cases; and providing rubric-based evaluation for fine-grained, domain-specific assessment. Evaluating Long-Form Generations. Beyond traditional shallow n-gram overlap-based metrics [15, 16], BLEURT [17] and BERTScore [18] use contextualized embeddings to assess semantic similarity between generated and reference texts. For more granular evaluation, recent research explores fact decomposition-based methods, extracting atomic facts from generated and reference texts 1The benchmark leaderboard and links to code and public data: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ launch/ExpertLongBench. 3 for comparison using NLI models or LLMs. [19, 20]. Nevertheless, the fact decomposition process lacks task-specific considerations for fact granularity, which can result in inconsistent evaluations [21]. Another line of work, commonly termed LLM-as-a-judge, prompts LLMs to assess generated outputs against general, high-level criteria such as fluency, coherence, and relevance [22]. To enhance task specificity, checklist-based evaluations are incorporated into WildBench [10] and BiGGenBench [23], which evaluate outputs against instance-specific checklists derived from task requirements. However, the absence of grounding for these checklists in reference outputs can introduce coarse and vague criteria, often leading to subjective assessments and hindering the accurate evaluation of content coverage and relevance. Our evaluation framework, CLEAR, builds on these directions by extending fact decomposition and checklist-based evaluation. We derive task-specific checklists from an expert-designed rubric, thereby adapting prior checklist-based methods to better support expert-level tasks. For each checklist item, we extract relevant facts from the model outputs and/or references and compare them to compute item-level scores, enabling fine-grained and objective evaluations."

            "title": "3.1 Overview",
            "content": "We introduce EXPERTLONGBENCH, multi-disciplinary benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on real-world expert-level tasks that require long-form inputs and outputs. EXPERTLONGBENCH features fine-grained evaluation rubric tailored to reflect the rigorous standards and nuanced requirements of expert domains. The benchmark covers 11 expert-level tasks as shown in Tab. 1, including six tasks with newly collected data featuring unique challenges such as super-long input, where experts typically spend over 10 hours to complete [5]. Notably, rubric design is complex and highly time-intensive; for instance, creating the rubric for T1LegalMDS required over 10 hours of expert effort. The selection of these tasks adhere to specific criteria: (1) it is possible to create well-defined rubric for consistent and objective evaluation; (2) it requires domain expertise for both task resolution and assessment; and (3) it is grounded in real-world expert workflows. Addition task selection details are discussed in Appendix and Appendix B. Generally, each sample in EXPERTLONGBENCH includes the following key elements: Task Input: The context of the task. For example, the inputs for T2LegalSFG consist of relevant transcripts used to generate Statement of Fact, with each sample on average having 14 documents totaling 70k input tokens. Human Reference: Each task includes human-authored references in natural language. Details can be referred to Appendix B. Checklist-mapped Reference: checklist-based, fine-grained evaluation rubric is designed for each task through collaboration with domain experts and by referencing established resources. corresponding checklist-mapped reference is constructed for every sample, as detailed in 3.2. Tab. 1 summarizes key statistics of our benchmark. In total, our benchmark contains 1,050 samples, with an average input length and human reference length of 36,204 and 851 tokens, respectively. Specifically, T2LegalSFG has the highest average input and output length. For each task, we describe the task definition, significance, data acquisition and preprocessing, representative examples, evaluation rubric, and the construction of checklist-mapped references in Appendix B. 3.2 Benchmark Construction Procedure Task Sources. EXPERTLONGBENCH draws data from two primary sources: 6 newly curated task data and 5 adapted existing task data as shown in Tab. 1. The first source includes tasks newly developed by the authors specifically for this benchmark, designed to address gaps in existing resources and better capture real-world expert challenges. Tasks are selected by discussing with domain researchers and practitioners, who also contributed to rubric design. In parallel, we also look into existing datasets and corpora that fit the goal of accessing the capabilities of LLMs on expert-level tasks. To adapt these for our benchmark, we carefully select representative and challenging samples 4 from the original datasets with details and examples shown in Appendix B. Moreover, we design checklist-based rubric for the tasks and create checklist-mapped references for the samples. Expert-guided Rubric Design. For each task, we design checklist-based fine-grained evaluation rubric to assess model performance. Our rubric design follows two complementary approaches: 1) Expert-guided design: we collaborate closely with domain experts to co-design evaluation criteria that reflect professional standards and practical requirements and needs. 2) Protocol-refinement design: for tasks with established evaluation protocols guided by experts, we design fine-grained criteria by refining and expanding upon existing standards, ensuring more granular and systematic assessment of model performance. An example rubric showcasing subset of its checklist items is illustrated in Fig. 1. In appendix B, we show all checklist items for each task. Notably, these rubrics are written by experts, ensuring high-quality criteria that existing LLMs cannot yet replicate (refer to Appendix I). In future work, we will explore methods for automatically generating high-quality checklists. Additional examples along with detailed rubric designs for each task are in the Evaluation Rubric section for each task in Appendix B. Sample Selection We establish criteria for further refining the sample pool in tasks with an initial sample size exceeding 100, ultimately selecting 100 representative samples for each task. Our selection criteria focus on two key aspects: diversity and difficulty. For diversity, the select samples encompass broad range of variations. For example, we select samples covering wide range of sectors and companies for T10FinanceESG and prioritize the diversity of diagnosis types for T9MedicalDR. For difficulty, we identify key factors influencing difficulty for each task. For instance, we collaborate with legal researchers to determine factors such as document length, number of appeals, number of complaints, and number of dockets for T1LegalMDS. We applied these criteria across most tasks. Details are provided in the Appendix B. Checklist-mapped Reference Creation To better evaluate models capability for long-form generation on expert-level tasks according to the designed fine-grained rubric, we construct checklist-mapped references by extracting the content corresponding to each checklist item from the human reference using GPT-4o. Exceptions include T3MaterialSEG and T10FinanceESG, where the checklist-based references are constructed during the data collection process (T3) or the human references are well-structured and can simply process to structured checklist-mapped reference (T10). Example checklist-mapped references for T1LegalMDS are shown in Fig. 1 and the checklist-mapped reference subsections in Appendix B. Specifically, we adopt role-playing strategy by prompting GPT-4o to extract all relevant information for each checklist item as comprehensively as possible from the reference. If no such information is present, the model is instructed to return N/A. Example extraction prompts are illustrated in the checklist-mapped reference subsections in Appendix B. Throughout this paper, we will use the following notation: the checklist for given task is denoted as {ci}n i=1, where is the number of checklist items associated with the specific task. To operationalize this extraction, we design instructions for each checklist item and use GPT-4o to extract the checklist information. Among the tasks where mapping references to checklists is straightforward, we selected two tasks for both human evaluation and LLM-as-judge evaluation to ensure quality. Evaluation results show that the mapped references achieve over 90% faithfulness and coverage. Detailed information is provided in 4.2. For other tasks, human inspection was employed to ensure the mapping quality. Additional details can be found in Appendix B."

            "title": "4 Checklist-based Performance Assessment using CLEAR",
            "content": "In this section, we introduce CLEAR for expert-aligned evaluation of model performance on expertlevel tasks. As shown in Fig. 1, given model output, our framework maps its information to items in the checklist derived from the expert-design rubric, and assesses the quality of the model output by comparing the checklist-mapped model output against the checklist-mapped human reference (4.1). We quantitatively justify key design choices in our evaluation pipeline, including the selection of the checklist-mapper and the judge for checklist comparison (4.2). 5 4.1 Evaluation Process Generating Checklist-Mapped Model Responses. We follow the same procedure described in 3.2 to extract checklists from model responses. However, instead of using GPT-4o, which can be significantly more expensive while extracting checklists from all models, we opt for the open-source model Qwen2.5-72B as the checklist mapper considering its availability of model weights and decent extraction performance, which will be validated in 4.2. Assessing Response Quality using Checklists. To evaluate checklist-mapped responses, we assess the degree to which the checklist-mapped model response aligns with that of the reference. To this end, we use GPT-4o within an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm [2426], adapting the reference-based scoring methodology [27] to evaluate the semantic alignment between each checklist item in model response and the corresponding information in the reference for every sample. For instance, consider checklist item with corresponding information in the model response and reference denoted as H(c) and R(c), respectively. The LLM judge assigns binary score to each checklist item by evaluating whether the semantic content of R(c) is contained within H(c). The prompt for the judge is included in Appendix C. Despite suggestions to employ multiple models from different families as judges to mitigate biases [27], we use only GPT-4o, as it saves cost and shows high agreement with candidate judge models, as discussed in 4.2. After performing item-level assessment for checklist-mapped model response, we define its checklist precision (checklist recall) as the fraction of checklist items whose model response (reference) is semantically contained within the reference (model response) and accuracy as the fraction of checklist items whose model response and reference mutually contain each other. The sample-level checklist F1 score is the harmonic mean of the checklist precision and checklist recall, and we obtain the task-level performance by averaging the sample-level metrics. 4.2 Evaluation Component Validation Model Selection for Checklist Mapper. To enable accessible and low-cost checklist mapping, we evaluate open-weight modelsLlama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Mistral-Large-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-72B using reference checklists extracted by GPT-4o. We, first, validate the quality of these reference checklists through human and automated evaluations on tasks T1 and T6, confirming over 90% faithfulness and coverage. We selected these two tasks due to their challenging long contexts and extended output requirements involving over 25 checklist items. To identify suitable open-weight mapper, we evaluated tasks T1, T6, T7, and T8 which spans diverse domains and configurations of input / output length. Qwen2.5-72B achieved the highest average performance with an average F1-score of 90.1%, demonstrating its applicability for accurate checklist mapping. See Appendix for details on above analyses. Model Selection for Checklist Evaluation. To support the choice of solely using GPT-4o for evaluating the checklist, we measured the alignment between the annotations produced by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash on the aforementioned data used for examining checklist mapping by open-weight models. The observed Cohens Kappa scores were 0.81 for T1, 0.87 for T6, 0.89 for T7, and 0.85 for T8, indicating near-perfect level of inter-annotator agreement. These high agreement scores validate the choice of using GPT-4o annotations exclusively for the final evaluations."

The models are sorted by their average F1 score across all tasks. Accuracy, precision, and recall are reported in Tab. 45, Tab. 46, and Tab. 47. The tasks in EXPERTLONGBENCH pose significant challenges to existing LLMs. Notably, Gemini-2.0-Flash, the top-performing model in our evaluation, achieves an average F1 score of only 26.8, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Among all tasks, T2 proves to be the most challenging, with all models scoring an F1 below 8. In addition to the complex nature of legal argumentation, T2 involves longer inputs and necessitates longer outputs, thereby further testing the long-context capabilities of the models. Scaling does not consistently improve performance across tasks. We observe that within the same model family, the larger model outperforms their smaller counterpart in terms of average performance. However, this superiority is not consistent across all individual tasks. For example, on task T4, Mistral-Large-Instruct ranks 2nd while Mistral-Nemo-Instruct ranks 9th. Conversely, on task T10, Mistral-Large-Instruct ranks 6th, whereas Mistral-Nemo-Instruct achieves the best performance across all models. In fact, no single model consistently outperforms its smaller variant from the same family across all tasks. This inconsistency may suggest that the pre-training curricula of existing LLMs might not uniformly emphasize or adequately represent the domainspecific tasks, especially when scaling for larger models, potentially leading to an imbalance in their capabilities across different tasks. Proprietary models are not always superior. Proprietary models, which are expected to be larger and more capable of handling diverse tasks, are not always better than openweight models. Specifically, Claude is less designed for expert-level workflows. Compared with other families, Claude-3.7-Sonnet only outperforms Qwen2.5-7B, and Claude-3.5Haiku yields the lowest overall score. Among open-weight models, Qwen generally demonstrates the weakest performance. Both Qwen models have 32K token context length, shorter than other models which offer 128K or longer. This discrepancy in context length leads to significant performance disparity for Qwen on T10, which requires processing an average of 64K input tokens, where the performance of Qwen2.5-72B trails the leading model by 17.5. Figure 2: F1 score vs. coverage of checklist items. The coverage of checklist items is the percentage of checklist items that are covered in the generated text regardless their correctness. High coverage of checklist items does not imply high output quality. We further investigate the percentage of checklist items covered in the generated text, irrespective of correctness, and its correlation with output quality, as measured by the F1 score. Fig. 2 illustrates the relationship between checklist item coverage and the F1 score, aggregated across all experimented models and tasks, as 7 well as presented separately for task T10. positive correlation between coverage and F1 score is observed for most tasks, resulting in an overall positive correlation when averaged. However, the correlation coefficient remains lowmodels frequently obtaining high coverage scores while concurrently exhibiting low F1 scores, suggesting their ability to produce content that seemingly adheres to domain-specific standards but incorporates incorrect information. Such behavior presents risk, as the output might mislead users into perceiving the generated content as reliable due to its apparent completeness, despite its underlying inaccuracies. The issue is notably more pronounced for T10 (ESG report summarization), where coverage exhibits negative correlation with output quality. The structure of ESG reports provides hints for elements that should be covered in the output. However, due to the volume of information, models cannot precisely identify which information is most critical to stakeholders. Further main results and detailed outcomes for each task can be found in Appendix D."

            "content": "While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance in evaluating checklist-aligned model responses [30 34], there are three primary concerns associated with the use of closed models: (a) they are typically accessible only through paid APIs, with costs that can escalate rapidly in large-scale experiments involving multiple queries or extended outputs; (b) their deployment on external servers raises data privacy and security concerns, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, law, and education; and (c) proprietary models are subject to unannounced updates or version changes, which can compromise the reproducibility of results across studies or even within the same research group over time. Therefore, the primary objective of this section is to investigate whether the judge component in our evaluation pipeline can be substituted with open-weight alternatives to promote more accessible and reproducible research environment. To this end, we evaluate various open-weight models and their combinations as judge models by measuring how well their accuracy scores correlate with those from GPT-4o, which serves as the ground truth due to its strong domain-level performance. For model combinations involving multiple judge models, we explore two pooling strategies [35, 27] to compute an aggregate score for each sample: (a) Mean Pooling, where the final score is the average of the scores assigned by each constituent judge; and (b) Majority Pooling, where the final score corresponds to the mode of the individual scores. In cases where multiple modes exist, we resolve the tie by averaging their values. The results presented in Tab. 51 show computed the correlation among the In scores of various model variants. the category labeled Small this table, from Llama3.1-8Bcombines scores Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct, and Mistral-Large-Instruct. Similarly, the category Large includes Llama-3.3-70BInstruct, Mistral-Large-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-72B. The category Allsmall encompasses models from Small and GPT-4o-mini. Figure 3: Correlation of different model combinations with GPT-4o judgments averaged over all the tasks. Best performing single model judge. From Fig. 3, we find that most judge models exhibit high degree of correlation with GPT-4o with Qwen2.5-72B yielding the highest average correlation among all single judges. This indicates that single model can reliably assess checklists while significantly maintaining computational overhead to low value. Combining models results in better correlation than its individual counterparts. Additionally, combining open-source models enhances alignment with GPT-4o. For instance, while Llama3.1-8BInstruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B individually achieve average correlations of 0.65, 0.80, and 0.78, respectively, majority pooling their outputs raises the correlation to 0.82. Moreover, in most model combinationsexcluding large-open-source-modelsmajority pool8 ing consistently outperforms mean pooling in terms of correlation. Since majority pooling is more effective for estimating binary variables [27], and our checklist scoring relies on binary labels, it leads to more accurate overall score assignment. Tasks T1 and T2 exhibit the lowest average correlations as shown in Tab. 51 and weakest model performance referring to Tab. 2, indicating that higher task complexity may hinder reliable evaluation. Connection between task complexity and judgment correlation with GPT-4o. regression analysis of the relationship between task complexity and average judgment correlation with GPT-4o (see Fig. 4) reveals strong correlation and moderately high R2 value, indicating that the regression model explains substantial portion of the variance. This can be used to decide the scale of model for evaluating particular task. For instance, smaller models like Qwen2.5-7B and Mistral-NemoInstruct align well with GPT-4o for less complex tasks. For more challenging tasks such as T1 and T2, larger models like Qwen2.5-72B are recommended."

            "content": "Figure 4: Regression analysis between the average performance along each task and the average correlation of judgments with GPT-4o assignments We provide detailed skill-level and difficulty-level analysis of model performance on EXPERTLONGBENCH for better understanding of where current models excel and where they fall short. Our analysis is grounded in fine-grained examination of each tasks checklist items, identifying the specific skills required to fulfill each item at corresponding difficulty levels. Detailed explanations of the skills, difficulty levels, and item-level skill and difficulty mapping are provided in Appendix F. We examine model performance across varying knowledge levels including Below College, College, and Graduate, and reasoning difficulty including Low (Knowledge Memorization), Medium (Knowledge Understanding), High (Knowledge Applying), Very High (Knowledge Creating) [36, 37]. We present our key findings as follows. (a) Model performance across various levels of knowledge difficulty. (b) Model performance across various levels of reasoning complexity. Figure 5: Model performance across various difficulty levels. Knowledge complexity and reasoning difficulty are major barriers. The consistent performance drop at the Graduate-level knowledge as shown in Fig. 5a highlights substantial challenge for current models in mastering expert-level knowledge. The clear performance decline with higher reasoning difficulty as shown in Fig. 5b emphasizes the importance of assessing models beyond knowledge memorization and understanding, focusing on their ability to perform complex reasoning. 9 Most models perform worse on low reasoning difficulty level (knowledge memorization) than medium reasoning difficulty level (knowledge understanding) because the expert-level knowledge in EXPERTLONGBENCH may be long-tail knowledge that rarely appears during training, limiting memorization performance, while the model can still leverage its reasoning and generalization abilities to approximate understanding [38]. Notably, EXPERTLONGBENCH is specifically designed to assess more advanced knowledge processing skills. Importance of diverse difficulty levels in benchmarking. Models show divergent strengths. For instance, Claude-3.7-Sonnet ranks first in the low reasoning level (knowledge memorization) but ranks relatively low in the very high reasoning level (knowledge creation) (Fig. 5b). These results emphasize the value of benchmark with diverse difficulty levels, which captures performance differences across varying knowledge and reasoning levels, revealing model strengths and weaknesses that might be overlooked in general benchmarks. Notably, EXPERTLONGBENCH is meticulously designed to provide comprehensive evaluation across diverse difficulty levels, and we recommend the community to leverage EXPERTLONGBENCH for future model evaluation. Analysis results on more general skills and additional details are in Appendix F."

            "title": "8 Conclusion",
            "content": "We introduce EXPERTLONGBENCH, multi-domain expert-level benchmark. EXPERTLONGBENCH comprises 1050 samples, spanning 11 tasks across 9 distinct domains. These tasks, originating from realistic expert applications rather than typical question-answering scenarios, demand long-form outputs that adhere to domain-specific standards. Each task is accompanied by an expert-designed and validated rubric, which serve as evaluation guidelines. To evaluate long-form model outputs on these expert tasks, we design CLEAR, an evaluation framework that maps model outputs and references into checklists derived from the rubric and subsequently performs an item-by-item comparison of these checklists. This process yields fine-grained, grounded evaluation that aligns with domain-specific requirements. We conduct experiments with 11 LLMs, revealing that EXPERTLONGBENCH pose significant challenge for current LLMs. While these models can generate content that superficially matches required aspects, they frequently lack accuracy. Further analysis of CLEAR demonstrates the feasibility of substituting proprietary models with open-weight alternatives for the roles of checklist mapper and evaluator, facilitating low-cost, scalable benchmarking."

            "title": "A Benchmark Description",
            "content": "Task Selection Considerations. We follow set of rigorous task selection criteria designed to meet our objective to accessing LLMs capability to solve expert-level tasks: 1. Human reference outputs: We only include tasks for which reliable human reference outputs are either directly available or can be accurately derived. 2. Long-form outputs: We focus on tasks with open-ended and long-form outputs, avoiding simple information extraction or classification tasks that lack substantial natural language output. 3. Objectivity: All selected tasks must be objective, allowing multiple annotators to reasonably agree on the correctness of response. 4. Domain expertise requirement: Tasks must also require domain expertise, both for task completion and for evaluating the outputs. 5. Real-world importance and impact: We emphasize tasks with clear importance and real-world impact, particularly those that reduce expert workload or improve efficiency, accessibility, or scalability in professional workflows. 6. Targeting real-world users: We ensure all tasks are designed to target realistic problemsolving scenarios. For tasks adapted from existing datasets, we apply two additional filters: 1. Accessibility: by selecting only publicly available datasets 2. Recency: giving preference to datasets released recently to minimize potential contamination from model training data. Key Elements of Samples. Each sample in EXPERTLONGBENCH includes the following key elements: Task input: The context of the task. For example, the inputs for T2LegalSFG consist of relevant transcripts used to generate Statement of Fact, with each sample on average having 14 documents totaling 70k input tokens. 17 Human reference: Each task includes human-authored references in natural language. Exceptions include T3MaterialSEG and T9MedicalDR, for which checklist-based references are constructed during the data collection process. Checklist-mapped reference: checklist-based, fine-grained evaluation rubric is designed for each task through collaboration with domain experts and by referencing established resources. corresponding checklist-mapped reference is constructed for every sample, as detailed in 3.2 in the main paper. Checklist-mapped Reference Creation. To ensure the quality of our LLM-based checklist-mapped references, we adopt the following two strategies: For tasks where mapping references to checklists is straightforward (e.g., T1, T2, T5, T6, T7, T8, T10), we randomly select two tasks (T1, T6) and conducted human evaluation and LLM-as-judges evaluation for ensuring the quality. Details are shown in 4.2 in the main paper. For other tasks (e.g., T4, T11), we perform manual quality assurance on the models extracted checklist-mapped references for all samples. This process involves human reviewers inspecting and correcting any extraction errors. The remaining tasks (e.g., T3, T9) directly produce the checklist-mapped reference and no prompting is needed."

            "title": "B Task Description",
            "content": "B.1 T1LegalMDS B.1.1 Task Definition Legal case summarization involves generating concise, coherent, and informative summaries from multiple legal documents pertaining to single case. These documents can include wide range of materials such as complaints, appeals, court opinions, motions, filings, judgments, and other related legal records. The objective is to summarize critical aspects of case into summary that is accessible to broad audience, including legal professionals such as policymakers, advocates, researchers, educators, and students, as well as the general public. When using LLMs to conduct the legal case summarization task, the input is typically collection of relevant legal documents associated with specific case and the output is case summary that encapsulates the essential information from the original documents. B.1.2 Task Significance Legal case summarization is foundational task for improving access to justice, supporting legal research, and facilitating informed decision-making across the legal system. Many real-world cases involve large volumes of interrelated documents. These include complaints, motions, rulings, and settlement agreements, which must be synthesized into concise, coherent summaries. Automatic summarization addresses this issue by condensing lengthy texts into concise summaries, enabling users to quickly grasp essential details without reading the entire document [5]. This automation enhances accessibility by providing clear summaries for lawyers, scholars, and the general public, improves efficiency by assisting legal professionals in quickly understanding case details, and supports research by highlighting crucial aspects of cases. By reducing the time and effort required to comprehend extensive legal materials from legal experts, automatically generated summaries streamlines legal workflows and aids in informed decision-making. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in domains where litigation is prolonged, procedurally complex, and socially impactful. One such domain is civil rights litigation, which has played pivotal role in reforming public institutions and shaping policy in areas such as education, policing, incarceration, and disability rights. These cases often span years and generate hundreds of filings, yet most remain inaccessible to the broader public, scholars, and even practitioners. The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse4, leading repository in this space, curates extensive documentation from landmark and ongoing civil rights casesmany of which have never resulted in published judicial opinions. As result, key legal developments are often buried in unstructured documents that are difficult to access and interpret without expert knowledge. Multi-document case summarization helps bridge the accessibility gap. It 4https://clearinghouse.net/ 18 enables non-experts to understand legal developments, allows legal professionals to quickly grasp the structure and outcome of complex cases, supports advocacy and policymaking by surfacing systemic patterns, and reduces the burden of reviewing lengthy legal documents, giving researchers easier access to representative case content. We collect data from Clearinghouse, with further details provided in Appendix B.1.3. related work, Multi-LexSum [5], also investigates the task of multi-document legal case summarization in civil rights litigation domain using data from Clearinghouse. However, their study relies on automatic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE-{1,2,L} [16] and BERTScore [18]. In contrast, our work constructs new dataset by collecting cases data from the Clearinghouse and introducing clear selection criteria with legal researchers grounded in both diversity and difficulty, where diversity refers to the range of case topics and difficulty is based on structural factors such as such as the number of documents, length, and complexity of legal proceedings. Furthermore, we develop fine-grained, checklist-based evaluation rubric in collaboration with legal researcher to ensure comprehensive coverage of key case elements. To assess model performance more reliably, we design structured evaluation pipeline leveraging LLMs as evaluators, enabling nuanced analysis beyond surface-level lexical similarity. B.1.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing We collected multi-document legal case summarization data with 1,393 legal case samples from widely recognized legal repository, Clearinghouse. We obtained the case data through the official Clearinghouse API5, which provides structured access to metadata and associated documents for civil rights litigation cases. For documents available in PDF format, we used the ocrmypdf6 tool to extract text from scanned legal filings, ensuring complete retrieval of document content. Each sample includes multiple case documents. Alongside these inputs, the dataset provides expert-crafted, gold-standard summaries that distill the key facts, legal principles, and outcomes of each case. These summaries are produced by trained legal expertsincluding lawyers and law studentswho follow detailed annotation guidelines. To further ensure consistency and accuracy, each summary undergoes an additional round of expert review. We then selected small, high-quality and representative subset from the large-scale dataset to evaluate the ability of LLMs in generating legal summaries. For representative data selection, we filter the data based on the following standards to select high-quality dataset. Diversity: We obtain the topic for each case on the Clearinghouse website and select cases spanning as many distinct topics as possible. The selected data covers diverse case types such as Equal Employment, Prison Conditions, Election/Voting Rights which contain the specific topic the legal case is dealing with. Difficulty: We identify several factors influencing difficulty after discussing with legal researchers. The factors are as follows: Length of the documents Number of appeals: Appeals are processes that the litigant asks for the higher court review of the lower courts decision, we obtain the number of appeals for each case from the Clearinghouse website. Number of complaints: Complaints are documents that start the lawsuit. We obtain the number of complaints for each case from the Clearinghouse website. Number of dockets: Dockets are logs containing comprehensive history of the case in chronological order. We obtain the number of dockets for each case from the Clearinghouse website. After this process, we select 454 samples with high difficulty level. To further ensure the quality of the gold-standard case summary, we discuss with legal researchers and identify the required checklist items that must be included in the summary. We then use GPT-4o as judge to assess whether the human-written reference covers the information and select the cases with highest-quality human summaries, determined by the highest coverage of checklist items. The specific prompt used for accessing the reliability of human-written summary is shown in Tab. 3. 5https://clearinghouse.net/api 6https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF Based on the judgment results, we finally select 100 samples with high-quality and long human reference summaries. B.1.4 Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 4. All samples for T1 are publicly available7. The sample input for T1 consists of multiple legal case documents from class-action lawsuit concerning COVID-19 conditions in immigration detention facilities. These include court filings such as status reports, motions, court orders, and objections, all focused on health and safety concerns at the Mesa Verde Detention Facility and the Yuba County Jail during the pandemic. Due to the length of the original documents, we provide only brief descriptions of each ones purpose and topic. The human reference output is an expert-curated summary that concisely captures the key legal developments and arguments in the case. It outlines the plaintiffs claims regarding unsafe detention conditions, the legal basis for the lawsuit, major court decisions (e.g., temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions), and procedural milestones such as appeals and mediation efforts. Additionally, Tab. 5 presents the model prompt. The prompt was carefully constructed to be highlevel and general instead of providing the exact checklist items. The inputs for this prompt are the documents shown in Tab. 4. B.1.5 Evaluation Rubric We closely collaborated with legal researchers to design checklist-based evaluation rubric to assess the helpfulness of legal case summaries. The process of designing, refining, and finalizing the rubric takes roughly 11 hours. This rubric comprises of 26 checklist items that capture key aspects to consider during the evaluation process. Some items are marked as if applicable, meaning they should only be considered when the case pertains to the corresponding checklist criteria. This terminology will be used in other task checklists as well. The detailed checklist items are listed as follows: 1. Filing Date 2. Class Action or Individual Plaintiffs? (if applicable): If there are class action plaintiffs the summary should say its class action; if there are individual plaintiffs it can just describe the plaintiffs. For example, use specific terms like The city or The parents rather than general terms like The defendant or The plaintiffs. 3. Cause of Action: e.g., statute (e.g., 42 USC 1983) or case (e.g., Ex Parte Young) 4. Statutory or Constitutional Basis for the Case: case can either be based on statute or provision of the Constitutioni.e., case will either claim that someone violated statute, or violated the Constitution. For cases that have constitutional basis, the summary should refer to the clause of the Constitution that was allegedly violated, as well as the amendment if applicable. For example it would say the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause, or the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Commerce Clause. 5. Remedy Sought: e.g., declaratory judgment 6. Who are the parties (description, not name)? 7. Type of Counsel: type of counsel contains private, legal services, ACLU, etc. 8. Consolidated Cases Noted (if applicable) 9. Related Cases listed by their case code number (if applicable) 10. Note important filings (if applicable): Note important filings including motions for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, etc. 11. All reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citation (if applicable): For example, the summary could write 2020 WL 4218003 after the paragraph in which it discusses that opinion. The summary does not need to include the case name, court, or date unless helpfulsuch as when the summary cites an opinion from different case. 7https://huggingface.co/datasets/launch/ExpertLongBench 20 Table 3: T1LegalMDS - Prompt for checking the quality of human-written references. Evaluate whether the given summary includes all the information listed in the checklist items. For each checklist item, provide whether the item is fully addressed (Yes or No) and brief explanation or evidence supporting your evaluation. Finally, provide an overall result summarizing whether all checklist items are covered in the given summary. Provide the overall result after ####, eg #### Yes or #### No. Given Summary: [REQUEST] Checklist Items: Filing Date Whether it contains the Date: yes/no Cause of Action Description: e.g., statute (e.g., 42 USC 1983) or case (e.g., Ex Parte Young) Whether it contains the information: yes/no * yes: the summary clearly states the action information * no: do not mention the action information Statutory or Constitutional Basis for the Case Description: case can either be based on statute or provision of the Constitution i.e., case will either claim that someone violated statute, or violated the Constitution. For cases that have constitutional basis, the summary should refer to the clause of the Constitution that was allegedly violated, as well as the amendment if applicable. So for example it would say the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause, or the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Commerce Clause. Whether it claim that someone violated statute or violated the Constitution: yes/no Whether it contains the statutory bases information or constitutional bases information: yes/no * yes: contains the statutory bases or constitutional bases information * no: do not contain any statutory basis or constitutional bases information Remedy Sought Description: e.g., declaratory judgment Whether it contains the information: yes/no Who are the parties (description, not name)? Whether it contains the information: yes/no * Whether it contains the plaintiff information * Whether it contains the description of the defendants (usually based on their office/- position if its government official): yes/no Type of Counsel Description: type of counsel contains private, legal services, ACLU, etc. Whether it contains the information: yes/no First and Last Name of Judge Description: Form: Judge John Smith. Whether the reference includes this information and the generated result also includes it, or the reference does not include this information and the generated result also does not include it: yes/no Factual Basis of Case Description: Refers to the facts or evidence upon which the case is built. These facts are essential in the legal process and are used to support legal claims or decisions. It typically includes: 1. Details of the relevant events: For example, what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. 2. Evidence: Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts. 3. Background information: Context or explanatory facts that provide additional understanding. In legal proceedings, the factual basis is crucial for determining the outcome of case, as the judge or jury makes decisions based on the facts and the applicable legal principles. Whether it contains the information: yes/no 21 Table 4: T1LegalMDS - sample of case documents and the corresponding case summary.

Case summary (Human reference): COVID-19 Summary: This is class-action lawsuit brought on April 20, 2020, by seven individuals in immigration detention at the Mesa Verde Detention Facility (MVDF) and the Yuba County Jail (YCJ), seeking immediate release from unsafe conditions of the jail in light of the global coronavirus pandemic. The court granted the request for TRO on April 29, requiring ICE to provide information and access to detainees to facilitate process of considering bail requests. On June 9, the court granted the motion for preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to maintain the status quo while the case was pending. On August 5, the plaintiffs sought TRO, claiming that the defendants actions were insufficient and it was granted the next day. After the parties agreed to implement testing and other public safety protocols, the defendants filed motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs responded with an amended class-action complaint. The court granted second preliminary injunction on December 3, 2020, and preliminary injunction related to YCJ outbreak on January 6, 2021. The defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit and the parties entered into mediation. ... Table 5: T1LegalMDS - Model prompt. Generate clear and legally precise summary of multiple-document legal case. Focus on capturing key facts, procedural history, and significant rulings in way that is easy to understand. Provide enough detail to convey the cases development and outcome without being excessively long or overly detailed. These are the case documents: 12. First and Last Name of Judge: Form: Judge John Smith. Find judges first names at http://www.fjc.gov/public/home.nsf/hisj 13. Significant Terms of Decrees (if applicable): Significant terms means the substance of the decree or settlement. In decree, the judge orders the defendants to do something; in settlement, the defendants agree to do something. The significant terms would be what the defendants are ordered/agree to do. 14. Dates of All Decrees (if applicable) 15. How long decrees will last (if applicable) 22 16. Significant Terms of Settlement (if applicable) 17. Date of settlement (if applicable) 18. How long settlement will last (if applicable) 19. Whether the settlement is court-enforced or not (if applicable) 20. Was there monitor? Note the name of the monitor (if applicable) 21. Monitors Reports (if applicable): monitors report explains whether defendant is complying with court order, so people want to know which terms of the order are being complied with. For example, from this case: In February 2016, the monitor filed her first semi-annual report. The report stated that the payment to the plaintiffs and plaintiffs counsel was made; the requirement of hiring ADA Coordinators was nearly compliant; videophone installation is apparently compliant; free access to videophone, provision of qualified interpreters for unscheduled medical emergencies, and provision of qualified interpreters for disciplinary hearings were unclear; informational materials were partially compliant; the routine and situational reporting were difficult or partially noncompliant; and training was noncompliant. 22. Appeal (if applicable) 23. Trials (if applicable) 24. Court rulings on any of the important filings (if applicable): This category corresponds with the important filings categoryso whenever an important filing is mentioned, people also want to know what the ruling on that filing was (if there is one)e.g., whether the judge granted or denied motion to dismiss. Generally these filings would be: Motions to dismiss, Motions for summary judgment, Motions for preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, Motions for class certification, Motions for attorneys fees, Amended complaintsthese wont have rulings, so they should be in the important filings category but not the rulings on to important filings category, statements of interestsimilar to above, there wont be rulings on these. 25. Factual basis of case: Refers to the facts or evidence upon which the case is built. These facts are essential in the legal process and are used to support legal claims or decisions. It typically includes: 1. Details of the relevant eventsFor example, what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and who was involved. 2. Evidence Physical evidence, documentary records, witness testimonies, etc., that support these facts. 3. Background informationContext or explanatory facts that provide additional understanding. In legal proceedings, the factual basis is crucial for determining the outcome of case, as the judge or jury makes decisions based on the facts and the applicable legal principles. 26. Disputes over settlement enforcement (if applicable) B.1.6 Checklist-mapped Reference We created checklist-mapped references for the human reference and the model output based on our 26-item checklist. For the human reference, we used GPT-4o to extract answers to each checklist item individually. Each prompt targeted single item and followed structured format. To improve contextual If no related grounding, we used role-playing to frame the model as an assistant to lawyer. information was mentioned in the legal case summary, the model should return N/A to reduce the possibility of hallucination. An example is shown in Tab. 6. For the model output, we use Qwen2.5-72B to create the checklist-mapped reference. Our decision to use different model is supported in 4.1. To reduce cost while maintaining quality, we grouped the checklist items rather than prompting for them individually. We divide the 26 items into five groups, each with four to six checklist items, based on the average expected length of the models response. Each model output prompt used the same template, role-playing format as the human reference prompt. Due to space constraints, we release the full prompt set in our public GitHub repository. The checklist-mapped reference of the example in Tab. 4 is presented in Tab. 7. To assess the quality of the checklist-mapped reference, we selected an additional 30 difficult and diverse samples, different 23 Table 6: T1LegalMDS - Prompt for extracting checklist-mapped reference.

All reported opinions cited with shortened Bluebook citation (if applicable): 2020 WL 2059848; 2020 WL 3055449; 2020 WL 4554646 12. First and Last Name of Judge: Vince Chhabria 13. ... from the main dataset, and conducted human verification to examine the faithfulness of the model response. Details of this experiment can be found in Appendix E.1. 24 B.2 T2LegalSFG B.2.1 Task Definition Statement of Fact (SOF) is document used in legal cases to persuade the judge of certain viewpoint. It outlines the events and circumstances leading up to legal dispute in an objective manner, while also incorporating persuasive language when appropriate [39]. The objective is to generate comprehensive account of the case, based on courtroom transcripts, that accurately reflects the its development. The input includes transcripts from multiple proceedings, such as preliminary trials, adjudication hearings, and termination trials. The output should present all relevant facts, direct quotations, and procedural details with proper attribution and clear alignment to legal standards. It must stand alone as complete summary, without requiring reference to the original transcripts. B.2.2 Task Significance SOFs play an crucial role in improving clarity, consistency, and accessibility in the documentation of court proceedings. They are part of legal brief, formal documents submitted to court that outline the relevant facts, applicable laws, and legal arguments of case. Our samples are specific to in child welfare and termination of parental rights cases. These cases often involve complex and emotional content that must be translated into reliable and grounded summaries. Traditionally, drafting such briefs is time-intensive and expert-level task. Attorneys must review hundreds of pages of transcripts to extract and organize key information into create an coherent narrative. This process often takes 20 to 40 hours or more, even for seasoned professionals [40]. Manual note-taking adds further difficulty - often leading to inconsistent phrasing, missed information or subjective interpretation. It also requires frequent references to transcripts, which not only slows progress, but increases the risk of delays and oversights in case processing. Automating this process with LLMs addresses these challenges by generating detailed and structured briefs. They are especially crucial in child welfare systems, where timely and accurate information directly impacts case decisions and the well-being of children. In this task, transcripts are drawn from real juvenile court proceedings provided by our collaborators, and outputs are compared against detailed rubric developed with experts to ensure both completeness and legal relevance. B.2.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Domain experts provided us with 113 samples of transcripts in Word document or PDF form. We first processed all documents using custom script to extract clean, structured text from each file, regardless of format. The script handles .docx, .doc, and .pdf files and includes fallback methods to ensure robustness across formatting inconsistencies. For .pdf files, we first attempted direct text extraction using PyPDF28. If the PDF lacked embedded text (e.g., scanned images), we applied OCR using OCRmyPDF9 with deskewing, noise cleaning, and compression optimizations. This was the library recommended to us by our collaborators. For .docx files, we used the python-docx library10 to extract paragraph-level content. For older .doc files, we employed fallback approach using textract11, antiword12, or conversion to .docx using LibreOffice in headless mode13. Each line of extracted text was then cleaned to remove extraneous whitespace and empty lines, ensuring that only content-relevant information was retained. However, page numbers were retained in the final text as the model prompt asked the LLM to generate SOFs that cited the transcripts page numbers. Cleaned output was saved in plain .txt files, one per document. For each case, all .txt files were then concatenated into single input string in the format: transcript 1 name: transcript 1 content, transcript 2 name: transcript 2 content ... . This structured format served as the sample input. 8https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/ 9https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF 10https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/ 11https://pypi.org/project/textract/ 12http://www.winfield.demon.nl/ 13https://www.libreoffice.org/ 25 To filter 113 transcript samples, we selected the 100 with the longest human-written reference SOFs, consistent with the reasoning in 3.2. On average, the 100 samples included 14 transcript documents, each 5K+ tokens in length, and paired with human reference SOF also exceeding 5K tokens. This filtering ensured that our dataset contained the most information-dense and well-documented cases. B.2.4 Illustrative Example Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example.14 However, in Tab. 8, we provide the model prompt for obtaining model outputs. Table 8: T2LegalSFG - Model prompt. You are an expert appellate lawyer conducting comprehensive review of legal case based on the attached transcripts. Your task is to create chronological and unbiased narrative statement of facts, ensuring all key material details are accurately represented with specific transcript page citations. These are the transcripts: B.2.5 Evaluation Rubric We worked with three domain experts and drafted through three iterations of the checklist through discussion. It takes approximately 8 hours to design, revise, and finalize the rubric. The experts designed the checklist items and helped categorize each checklist item into general levels and provided brief definitions of some levels. It is important to note that some checklist items are conditional and depend on the responses to previous items. For instance, Items 26 and 27 correspond to different outcomes based on the response to Item 25. If the parent pled to adjudication, Item 26 should be completed and Item 27 will be N/A. If there was an adjudication trial instead, Item 27 should be used and Item 26 will be N/A. The detailed checklist items are listed below: Initial incident 1. When DHHS first made contact 2. What caused DHHS to become involved 3. Discrepancies between DHHS account and the parents account Background situation We want to know any facts about the parent and children that can help the court understand their situation more favorably. Examples can include parent having an unstable home environment growing up, parent having an abusive partner, child having disabilities, etc. 4. Challenges the parent faced when they were young 5. Problems the parent currently faces 6. Childs special needs How the child is doing 7. How the child(ren) is doing 8. Child(ren)s development 9. Child(ren)s interactions with the parent 10. Child(ren) talked about their feelings or experience Impact of each court event 11. Decision of judge 12. New actions the parent or agency has to do 13. Actions the parent or agency does not have to do anymore Details of service plan 14For review purpose, data can be previewed via the dataset url in the submission form. 26 In these cases, the court typically orders the parent to complete some requirements so they can get custody of their child back. Examples of services can include parenting classes, therapy, drug screens, etc. 14. Reasonable efforts to reunify 15. If the agency was not ordered to make reasonable efforts to reunify,what aggravating circumstances were present 16. Services the court required the parent to complete 17. For each service, what the service means 18. For each service, what objectives the parents have to meet Parent progress on service plan 19. How the parent complied with the services 20. How the parent did not follow through with the services 21. Parents compliance or noncompliance with the service plan Agency role in service plan The child welfare agency might help the parent with compliance with things like transportation help and therapy referral. But the government can also hurt the parent with things like delays and gaps in communication. 22. How the agency tried to help the parent get the services they need 23. How the agency or government ignored parent or undermined their efforts Adjudication hearing 24. When the adjudication hearing was held 25. An adjudication trial or the parent pled to adjudication 26. If the parent pled to adjudication, the specific allegations the parent pled to 27. If there was an adjudication trial, what statutory grounds for adjudication were found Permanency planning hearings 28. When each permanency planning hearing was held 29. What permanency plan was established 30. Courts reasons for the chosen permanency plan 31. Whether DHHS was ordered to initiate termination of parental rights 32. If the child has been in foster care for more than 15 of the last 22 months, and the court did not order DHHS to initiate termination proceedings, the courts reasoning Termination of parental rights hearings 33. Statutory grounds DHHS sought termination 34. Statutory grounds the court found that termination was proper 35. Evidence offered to show statutory grounds for termination were not met 36. Evidence offered to show termination was in the childs best interests 37. Evidence offered to show termination was not in the childs best interests 38. If the child was placed with relative, whether any parties discussed that placement weighing against termination 39. Evidence regarding what kind of permanency the child will have if the parents rights are terminated 40. Alternatives to termination of parental rights Last sentence 41. Ends with the final lower-court ruling 27 B.2.6 Checklist-mapped Reference The creation of the checklist-mapped reference is for T2 is similar to T1s process in described in Appendix B.1.6. However, unlike in T1, the checklist items used to construct the model output checklist-mapped reference are grouped differently. We divide the 41 items into nine groups based on: (1) the average expected length of the models response, and (2) the topical category of the item (e.g., Details of service plan, Impact of each court event, etc.). For instance, we grouped checklist items 16 together, as they all fall under the categories Initial incident and Background situation. This grouping strategy helps the model process large inputs more effectively by allowing it to focus on fewer sections at time. The prompt structure for extracting an individual checklist item is illustrated in Tab. 9. Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example for the checklistmapped reference. Table 9: T2LegalSFG - Prompt for extracting checklist-mapped reference. You are assisting an appellate lawyer in extracting key information from Statement of Facts (SOF). Given SOF, identify if it states when the DHHS first made contact with the family. Provide the extracted information. If when the DHHS first made contact with the family is not mentioned, state N/A. B.3 T3MaterialSEG B.3.1 Task Definition Materials science research involves synthesizing new materials and understanding their properties. synthesis recipe includes series of steps for creating target material, specifying the precursors and synthesis conditions used. In the task of synthesis explanation generation, the objective is to provide justifications for key decisions made in the recipe, considering factors such as the precursors structural motifs, reactivity, thermodynamic stability, and more. B.3.2 Task Significance material can often be synthesized through multiple methods, and the choice of precursors and synthesis conditions can significantly affect the properties and yields of the resulting material [41]. Understanding the reasoning behind these choices is essential for materials scientists aiming to optimize synthesis protocols and develop new materials with desirable properties through more efficient processes. Additionally, materials discovery efforts, especially those aided by high-throughput computations [42, 43], can be accelerated by prioritizing synthesis recipes that are grounded in the most promising mechanistic insights. Per our discussion with materials science researchers, writing the explanations for synthesis recipe from scratch would take well-trained materials science PhD student 1-2 hours. B.3.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Despite the availability of large-scale synthesis recipe datasets [43, 44], these curated recipes are not accompanied by explanations. Even for well-trained materials science PhDs, writing explanations for synthesis recipes from scratch is challenging and time-consuming. In contrast, given statements about the synthesis recipe, undergraduate-level chemistry students are able to distinguish between explanations and non-explanations. Therefore, we adopt semi-automated approach to collect synthesis recipes along with corresponding explanations from existing literature. We begin by consulting materials science researchers15 to identify the key aspects that explanations should address. Since papers in the field do not always explicitly state the rationale behind synthesis choices, we begin by identifying papers that are more likely to include such explanations. To do 15They are PhD candidates in materials science. 28 this, we extract synthesis recipes and potential explanations using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with carefully designed instructions.16 We then rank the papers based on the number of aspects covered. Starting from the top-ranked papers, we use GPT-4o to further extract synthesis recipes and corresponding explanations. Based on GPT-4os outputs, annotators with undergraduate-level chemistry knowledge verify the extracted recipes and collect accurate explanations. When explanations are absent from the paper, annotators are asked to discard the paper and move on to the next one, until the target number (50) of samples is collected. We retrieve papers containing the keyword solid-state synthesis from Science17 and Wiley18, as the aspects of interest are more relevant to solid-state synthesis. The text of the paper is extracted directly from the HTML version of the paper. During the automated extraction step, we generate five different outputs using GPT-4o for each paper to increase the recall of possible explanations. To improve the faithfulness of the extraction, we also prompt the model to provide the source sentences corresponding to each explanation. The prompt is shown in Tab. 10, which is based on the rubric designed in Appendix B.3.5. Feedback from the annotators indicates that some explanations extracted by the LLMs describe properties of the synthesized materials (e.g., crystal structure, conductivity) rather than justifying the synthesis steps themselves. B.3. Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 11. All samples for T3 are publicly available. The sample input is synthesis recipe for complex oxide thin film. The recipe describes the starting precursors, key thermal steps, and atmospheric conditions used during synthesis. This format mirrors the language and structure typically found in materials science literature and experimental protocols. The human reference output provides explanations for why each major synthesis step and condition was chosen. It should help researchers understand the scientific rationale behind the recipe, not just its procedural steps. Additionally, Tab. 12 presents the model prompt. B.3.5 Evaluation Rubric We work with PhD student in material science, whose research focuses on solid-state synthesis. They provide us with five papers19 that contain well-written explanations for synthesis recipes. We prompt GPT-4o, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Gemini-2.0-Flash to summarize the aspects of the explanations covered in these papers. The PhD student then reviews the aspects summarized by the three models, revises them, and adds additional key aspects that are not covered by the models. The final rubric includes six items: Selection of Precursors 1. Structural Considerations: Justify precursor selection by explaining how the precursors structural motifs (e.g., coordination environments, lattice arrangement) influence the target phase formation. 2. Handling Precursor Reactivity: Justify precursor selection by explaining the impact of precursor reactivity on phase evolution. 3. Physical and Chemical Properties of Precursors: Justify precursor selection by addressing how precursor properties (e.g., particle size, morphology) influences reaction kinetics and product morphology. Synthesis Conditions 4. Temperature and Heating Method: Justify the choice of synthesis temperature and heating method (e.g., based on thermodynamic considerations, reaction kinetics, heat transfer efficiency, or side reactions). 16We also experimented with in-context learning, but found that Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct often copied from the in-context examples rather than extracting content from the target paper. 17https://www.science.org 18https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com 19doi.org/10.1002/ejic.202100901, doi.org/10.1002/kin.21467, doi.org/10.1002/smll. 202206248, doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adj5431, doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adp3309 29 Table 10: T3MaterialSEG - Prompt for automatically extracting synthesis recipes and explanations. As material science research staff, your task is to examine the given paper using the provided checklist. The checklist contains multiple \"TODO\" fields that you must fill in based on the content of the paper. It is divided into two main parts: synthesis recipe and explanations. The checklist is as follows: {\"synthesis_recipe\": {\"target_material\": \"TODO\", \"precursors\": [\"TODO\"], \"synthesis_steps\": [\"TODO\"]}, \"high_level_explanation_aspects\": [{\"name\": \"Selection of Precursors\", \"sub_aspects\": [{\"name\": \"Structural Considerations\", \"description\": \"Justify precursor selection by explaining how the precursoru2019s structural motifs (e.g., coordination environments, lattice arrangement) influence the target phase formation.\", \"statements\": [\"TODO\"], \"source_texts\": [\"TODO\"]}, ... You must also following the following guidelines: - Extracting the Synthesis Recipe - Identify and extract the synthesis target, precursors, and steps from the paper. - You must not include rationales or motivations for the synthesis steps. They belong to the explanation section. - Extracting the Explanations (Rationales) - The explanation section requires extraction of individual statements regarding WHY specific precursors and reaction conditions were chosen in terms of how they enable or benefit the synthesis process. - The statements must be explicitly and directly mentioned in the paper. You will be fired if you do not follow this. - You must NOT infer or assume information. You will be fired if you do not follow this. - For each statement, you should also extract the corresponding source text from the paper. - You must not extract statements that only discuss properties of the target material, experiment settings, or experiment observations, without connecting them with WHY specific precursors and reaction conditions were chosen. - The statements should be categorized into distinct aspects (e.g., precursor selection, reaction conditions, processing parameters). - The paper might not contain statements for some aspects. Fill them with an empty string (`\"\"`) or an empty list (`[]`). - The statements must be as detailed and complete as possible (e.g., including important numbers resulted from computation, complete reasoning processes, by-products, side reactions, and potential consequences if mentioned in the paper). - Each statement can contain more than 1 sentence to ensure completeness. - Output Format: - If there are multiple target materials, pick the one that is more challenging to synthesize. - Ensure that the extracted information strictly follows the predefined checklist format. - Each output statement should follow the format '<precursor(s) or (and) condition(s)>: <how it (they) enable or benefit the synthesis reaction>'. - The final output should be structured in JSON format. 5. Atmosphere: Justify the choice of synthesis atmosphere environment (e.g., based on thermodynamic considerations, reaction kinetics, or side reactions). 6. Duration: Justify the choice of synthesis duration (e.g., based on reaction kinetics, phase transformation rates, or side reactions). B.3.6 Checklist-mapped Reference Synthesis explanation generation does not involve the checklist mapping process, as the annotation process directly produces the reference checklist. An example checklist-mapped reference is shown in the illustrative example in Tab. 11. 30 Table 11: T3MaterialSEG - sample of synthesis recipe and its corresponding explanations. Synthesis Recipe (Sample input): Target Material: Sr2FeMoO6-δ thin film Precursors: Strontium Nitrate (Sr(NO3)2), Iron(III) Nitrate (Fe(NO3)3xH2O), ammoniacomplexed molybdic acid Synthesis Steps: 1. Ultrasonic-nebulise an aqueous solution of the Sr and Fe nitrates with ammonia-complexed molybdic acid; use an Ar carrier gas to convey the mist onto heated substrate where in-situ pyrolysis forms an amorphous deposit. 2. Dry the deposited film at 300400 to remove solvent and convert the Mo-bearing species into SrMoO4 precursor phase. 3. Calcine the film in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at 700750 to burn out residual carbon and generate mixed SrMoO4 + SrFeO3-δ intermediate. 4. Reduce the film at 850900 for 4 in 5 % H2/Ar. Explanations (Human reference): Handling Precursor Reactivity SrMoO4 that forms during the low-temperature stages acts as reactive seed and disappears after high-T annealing, promoting the growth of the target Sr2FeMoO6-δ phase. Temperature and Heating Method 700750 calcination in O2 removes carbon and intentionally forms SrMoO4 + SrFeO3-δ mixture that is the thermodynamic gateway toward the ordered double-perovskite. 850900 reduction reduces SrMoO4 and supplies the thermal energy needed for Fe/Mo ordering; higher increases surface mobility, bringing the film closer to equilibrium ordering. Atmosphere The reducing 5% H2/Ar atmosphere is critical for achieving the desired phase by creating oxygen vacancies and facilitating the reduction of molybdenum ions, which are necessary for the formation of Sr2FeMoO6-δ. Table 12: T3MaterialSEG - Model prompt. You are materials science researcher. Given synthesis recipe that includes the target material, selected precursors, and synthesis steps, your task is to justify the key decisions made in the recipe. This includes explaining the rationale behind the choice of precursors, reaction conditions, and processing steps, using relevant principles such as structural compatibility, chemical reactivity, and desired phase formation. Output the explanation rationales as list of bullet points, where each bullet point contains complete sentences. B.4 T4EduPAE B.4.1 Task Definition Assessing pedagogical alignment involves evaluating how well large language model (LLM) can replicate effective teaching strategies, such as offering scaffolded guidance without directly revealing the answer [4547, 1]. One possible approach is to evaluate LLMs through real-world interactions with students. However, this poses challenges, as student responses can vary unpredictably across different models [48]. Additionally, using the same group of students to test multiple LLMs introduces complications: once students are exposed to topic in one session, their familiarity with the material can influence their performance in subsequent sessions, making it difficult to isolate the effectiveness of each system. Conversely, using different students for the same set of topics may lead to nonstandardized assessments due to variations in their prior knowledge and skill levels. The objective is to assess whether LLMs can provide pedagogically sound feedback that supports student learning without directly giving away answers. 31 To provide repeatable and standardized framework for evaluating the pedagogical abilities of different LLMs, we propose task focused on assessing the effectiveness and pedagogical alignment of feedback within tutor-student dialogue. Each task instance presents multi-turn conversation in which student attempts to solve biology problem with the guidance of tutor. The tutor employs step-by-step problem-solving strategy, breaking the larger problem into smaller sub-problems and promoting active learning by guiding the student through each segment [46]. This process is sequential: the student addresses one sub-problem at time before moving on to the next. The conversational context includes the full dialogue history up to the current sub-problem, concluding with the students latest response. For each instance, the evaluated LLM is required to carry out the following: (1) assess the accuracy of the students response using three coarse-grained categoriesaccurate, partially accurate, and inaccurate; (2) determine whether the student is experiencing difficulty with the current sub-problem by detecting repeated errors across multiple attempts; and (3) provide constructive, pedagogically sound feedback that both diagnoses the underlying misconceptions and supports the student in resolving them and (4) initiate transition to the next sub-problem, if applicable, once the students response is deemed satisfactory. When the student has made only single error on sub-problem, the feedback should be indirect and refrain from revealing the correct answer. Conversely, in cases of repeated mistakes, the feedback may include direct identification of the error and explicit corrective guidance, even if that entails disclosing the correct solution. This pedagogical plan is provided to each of the models being evaluated and we assess their ability in adhering to these instructions. B.4.2 Task Significance Given their remarkable capabilities across wide range of language processing and knowledgeintensive reasoning tasks, LLMs hold great promise as powerful tools for delivering effective learning experiences through intelligent tutoring systems. However, their application in educational contexts faces two key limitations. First, LLMs may produce inaccurate reasoning [49] or rely on incorrect information [50] when generating feedback, which can hinder rather than support student learning. Second, while LLMs are generally optimized to be helpful and harmless, the operational definition of helpfulness may not align with pedagogical goals. Specifically, fundamental strategy in conceptual learning is to guide students through problem-solving processes without directly revealing the answer. In contrast, LLMs are often trained to prioritize immediate assistance, which may conflict with the educational objective of fostering deep understanding through indirect guidance. To address these concerns, our task aims to evaluate several critical dimensions of an LLMs pedagogical capacity: (1) Its effectiveness in adhering to an explicit pedagogical plan; (2) Its ability to apply domain-specific knowledge to accurately interpret student responses and determine appropriate next steps; (3) Its capacity to comprehend the conversational context and identify the current sub-problem being addressed; (4) Its skill in offering feedback that accurately identifies and corrects errors; and (5) Its ability to formulate feedback that encourages active learning through indirect guidance rather than direct answers. B.4.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing We first provide background on the source of the data that will be used for building this task. We used the multi-turn student-tutor conversations simulated using GPT-4o by [51]. These dialogues are grounded in the socio-constructivist model of learning [52], where the tutor adopts supportive and encouraging tone while offering feedback through Socratic questioning and indirect hints, rather than direct instruction. An illustrative example of such conversation is provided in Tab. 15. Each simulated interaction features student working through complex biology problem that requires multi-step reasoning and problem decomposition, with the tutor guiding the student through the process, making the dataset well-suited for our evaluation. Human annotators validated each simulated example to ensure factual accuracy and alignment with the socio-constructivist learning model. The original authors used evaluation criteria that measured the accuracy of information (factual correctness), the relevance of the feedback to the current sub-problem and student errors (relevancy), the thoroughness of feedback in addressing all aspects of the sub-problem (completeness), and the impact of feedback on maintaining student interest (motivation). 32 In contrast, we concentrate solely on the non-affective components of the feedback, as prior studies have shown minimal influence of positive language and praise on student outcomes [53, 54]. Our primary objective is to develop evaluation criteria that assess the effectiveness of feedback in promoting conceptual understanding. Studies have consistently found that feedback elements which identify problems and errors and propose solutions are the most beneficial for student learning [5558]. Accordingly, our task is designed to evaluate an LLMs ability to generate feedback that provides accurate problem diagnosis and rectification. While indirect feedbacksuch as hints or questions that avoid explicitly identifying the mistake or providing the answercan foster meta-cognitive and conceptual learning, its effectiveness may diminish when students repeatedly struggle with the same sub-problem [59]. Accordingly, our evaluation also emphasizes the LLMs ability to generate contextually appropriate feedback based on the nature of the students mistakes for given sub-problem. In cases where the student makes repeated errors on the same sub-problem, the LLM should accurately recognize this pattern and respond with explicit error identification and corrective guidance. In this section, we explain how to get fine-grained information from the seed data collected by [51]. In the next subsection, we provide brief overview of the relevant information contained in the seed data. In the following subsection, we describe how to extract relevant elements from this data to support evaluation based on our proposed criteria. Finally, we explain our procedure to sample representative data covering diverse scenarios from this dataset. Information Elements in Seed Data: Consider single response of the tutor from the example shown in Tab. 15. We focus on the second response from the tutor and provide fine-grained information associated with it in Tab. 13. Table 13: T4EduPAE - sample of the information elements annotated by the authors. Tutor: Correct! slower metabolic rate would help conserve energy. Now, lets move on to the second subproblem: Identify second derived feature that helps conserve energy in metabolism. Evaluation of the Student Response: Correct response from the student Subproblem: Identify second derived feature that helps conserve energy in metabolism The Evaluation of the Student Response field assesses the accuracy of the students most recent answer. Although the original seed data includes over eight categories for this entry, we focus on the following three: (a) Incorrect response, (b) Correct response, and (c) Partially correct response. The Subproblem field indicates which sub-problem the feedback addresses. If the students response is correct, the feedback typically prompts them to proceed to new sub-problem, and the Subproblem field reflects this next target. Conversely, if the response is incorrect or partially correct, the feedback remains focused on the current sub-problem, and the Subproblem entry corresponds to that same step. Processing Data for Evaluating along our desired criteria: To assess effectiveness in error identification and rectification, we extract these components from the feedback generated by the simulated tutor. This extraction is carried out using GPT-4o for automated annotation, with subsequent human verification to ensure the accuracy of the identified issues and corresponding corrective suggestions. Since the task does not require deep domain-specific knowledge, the manual verification was performed by one of the authors with strong proficiency in English. An illustrative example of the extracted elements from single data point is provided in Tab. 14. To annotate whether student has made repeated mistakes on specific subproblem, we use the Evaluation of the Student Response and Subproblem fields to infer this state. Specifically, if the Subproblem value remains the same across two consecutive tutor responses and both responses evaluate the students answers as incorrect or partially correct, it indicates that the student is repeatedly struggling with the same subproblem. Data Sampling: We sampled total of 109 conversation instances, ensuring that each context corresponds to distinct problem. To study the impact of dialogue length, we selected approximately 33 Table 14: T4EduPAE - sample of the information elements extracted using GPT-4o. Tutor: Insects are definitely affected due to the loss of native plants they specialize in. Additionally, think about the larger animals that rely on forest structure and plant diversity. For instance, how might birds and mammals be affected? Error Identification: The student response is not comprehensive in covering organisms such as birds and mammals that are also affected by the conversion. Error Rectification: Think about the larger animals that rely on forest structure and plant diversity. For instance, how might birds and mammals be affected? equal numbers of examples for conversation lengths in the set {5, 7, . . . , 13}. Each length is an odd number, as conversations are structured to begin with student query and end with student response. Furthermore, for most conversation lengths, we balanced the samples across the following five outcome categories: (a) ends with an incorrect response without reattempt, (b) ends with an incorrect response after reattempt, (c) ends with correct response, (d) ends with partially correct response without reattempt, and (e) ends with partially correct response after reattempt. B.4.4 Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 15. All samples for T4 are publicly available. The sample input includes multi-turn tutor-student dialogue in which the student is asked to identify features that help mammals survive in energy-scarce environments. The conversation is broken into subproblems to promote step-by-step reasoning. In this example, the student suggests larger body size as an energy-conserving trait. The tutor must evaluate this response, determine its correctness, and provide pedagogically appropriate feedback that encourages deeper thinking without simply revealing the answer. The human reference demonstrates how to strike balance between affirming partial correctness and guiding the student toward improved reasoning. The model prompt is shown in Tab. 16. Table 15: T4EduPAE - sample of tutor-student conversation and its corresponding pedagogical aligned response. Tutor-student conversation (Sample input): Student: Q. Imagine you are mammal species living in an environment where energy sources are scarce. Determine three derived features that could have arisen in response to the need for constant, high-level metabolism in such an environment. Tutor: Lets break the problem into subproblems and tackle the subproblems one by one. Lets begin with the first subproblem: Identify derived feature that helps conserve energy in metabolism. Student: One feature could be slower metabolic rate. Tutor: Correct! slower metabolic rate would help conserve energy. Now, lets move on to the second subproblem: Identify second derived feature that helps conserve energy in metabolism. Student: Another feature could be larger body size. Pedagogical aligned response (Human reference): Evaluation of the student response - Partially Correct Feedback - larger body size could help conserve energy in some cases due to reduced surface area to volume ratio, which reduces heat loss. However, it depends on the specific environment and constraints. Can you think of another derived feature? 34 Table 16: T4EduPAE Model prompt. You are an tutoring agent, an AI-powered expert chatbot designed to help assist teachers in constructing the right pedagogical response for conversation thread between the teacher and the student. In particular conversation thread, the student asks the teacher question. The teacher adopts the strategy of dissociating the question into several sub-questions, and then tackling each sub-question one by one. The teacher does this by asking the student sub-question, and then helping the student to solve it until the student is able to answer it correctly. The teacher then moves on to the next sub-question, and so on, until all subquestions are solved. In given conversation thread, the teacher may have already helped the student solving several sub-questions. You are required to assess the latest sub-question being tackled by the teacher and its associated student response(s), and provide pedagogically aligned response to the teacher. You are guaranteed that the conversation thread provided to you always ends with student response. This pedagogically aligned response must have the following elements: 1. Evaluation of the student response: Evaluate the student response into one of the following categories: - a) Incorrect response: The student response is incorrect. - b) Correct response: The student response is correct and answers the sub-question. - c) Partially correct response: Either the student response is partially correct, or the student response is correct but does not completely answer the sub-question. 2. Repeated mistake: If the student response is incorrect or partially correct, check if the student has made mistake for the same sub-question before. If the student has made mistake for the same sub-question before, answer \"Yes\". Otherwise \"No\". 3. Feedback: Provide holistic feedback to the student in plain text format. The feedback must identify mistakes if the student response is incorrect or partially correct. Furthermore, identify the mistake indirectly without explicitly pointing it out if the student makes an error for the first time for the corresponding sub-problem. Otherwise, highlight the mistake explicitly. The feedback must also provide hint when the student response is incorrect or partially correct. Furthermore, the hint must indirect when mistake has been made for the first time for sub-problem. Otherwise, provide an explicit hint that would help student rectify their mistakes directly. Include praise only when the student performs the task correctly or partially correctly. Include motivation and encouragement when the student is making multiple mistakes for the sub-problem being targeted. Finally, if the student response is correct, suggest the next sub-question if applicable. The pedagogically aligned response must be provided in the following format: Evaluation of the student response: <evaluation> Repeated mistake: <Yes/No> Feedback: <Holistic Feedback provided as plain text whose content may include mistake identification (if required), mistake rectification (if required), praise (if required), encouragement and motivation (if required), and sub-question transition (if required).> B.4.5 Evaluation Rubric The detailed evaluation rubric is provided below: 1. Evaluation of the student response: Evaluating the response generated by the LLM in accurately identifying whether the student response is correct, incorrect or partially correct. 2. Repeated mistake: Whether the LLM generated response accurately identifies if the students reattempt along problem in incorrect / partially correct. 3. Error Identification: Whether the error identified by the LLM generated response is consistent with that of the reference if present. For cases where student response is correct, the LLM must not generate N/A. 4. Error Rectification: Whether the elements that describe the rectification of the error is consistent with that of the reference if present. For cases where student response is correct, the LLM must not generate N/A. 35 Table 17: T4EduPAE - Checklist-mapped reference. 1. Evaluation of the student response: Partially correct response 2. Repeated mistake: No 3. Error Identification: The student response does not fully address the suitability of larger body size as derived feature for conserving energy in all environments. 4. Error Rectification: Can you think of another derived feature? 5. Error Identification Type: Indirect 6. Error Rectification Type: Indirect 7. Sub-question Transition: N/A 5. Error Identification Type: Whether the feedback involves direct error identification when the student makes multiple inaccurate / partially accurate attempts along sub-problem and involve indirect problem identification otherwise 6. Error Rectification Type: Whether the feedback involves direct rectification of the errors when the student makes multiple inaccurate / partially accurate attempts along sub-problem and involve indirect problem rectification otherwise 7. Sub-question Transition: Whether the next sub-question in the LLM generated response is consistent with that of the reference. If all the sub-problems are solved or if the student makes an error along current one, then the feedback must not involve this aspect. B.4.6 Checklist-mapped Reference prompt for generating the checklist-mapped reference was unnecessary, as it was produced directly from the model output. Instead, to evaluate the quality of the generated output according to the rubric , we extracted comparable information from the reference tutor data. Appendix B.4.3 already describes how to identify elements that describe problem and corresponding solutions. Additionally, it provides method for determining whether the student is struggling with the current sub-problemspecifically by checking for repeated errors across attempts. This Repeated mistake attribute is used to assign appropriate values to the Error Identification type and Error Rectification type. These types are set to Indirect when the student is attempting the sub-problem for the first time. If the Repeated mistake flag is active, both types are instead set to Direct. Notably, these properties are only assigned when the students response contains an error. For the Sub-question Transition property, we directly use the value provided in the original dataset, which is only set when the student gives correct answer but the overall problem remains unsolved. An example of the checklist-mapped human reference from Tab. 15 is shown in Tab. 17. B.5 T5EduFG B.5.1 Task Definition The objective of this task is to evaluate whether an LLM can assess student responses with the same discernment as trained instructor or expert. In this setup, we consider an assignment designed by the course instructor, whose response takes the form of long-form essay. Although the instructor provides guidelines that students are expected to follow, these are intentionally not exhaustiveensuring that students are not simply spoon-fed detailed checklist of requirements. Instead, students are expected to adhere to additional implicit expectations informed by the course material covered thus far. While instructors are skilled at evaluating responses based on these unstated criteria, this task aims to determine whether an LLM can perform such evaluations effectively. More concretely, the assignment includes both public and private requirements. While the instructor is aware of both, the LLM is given only the public requirements and the course syllabus, and must use these to also evaluate the response against the private requirements. 36 B.5.2 Task Significance Our motivation to assess LLMs ability to evaluate student responses beyond student-facing rubric stems from the practical insight that instructors often do not rely solely on rubric Instead, they apply holistic judgments that incorporate broader, often implicit, expectations [60, 61]. This is particularly evident in writing assignments, where public rubrics tend to be too general to support nuanced evaluation. Instructors frequently augment them with private, instance-specific criteria to enable more accurate and context-sensitive scoring [62]. Building on these observations, we seek to determine whether LLMs can similarly move beyond surface-level guidelines to produce evaluations that align with instructor judgment. To study this, we use responses to an assignment, where the student-facing (public) rubric is subsumed by the private rubric used by the instructor. This setup allows us to test the LLMs capacity to evaluate in manner consistent with expert grading practices, including criteria not explicitly stated. B.5.3 Data Acquisition Data Description: For this task, we use data from the Economics 101 course at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor [63]. The assignment presents scenario in which an increase in the minimum wage in San Francisco could lead to increased adoption of automation. To counter this, two policy options are proposed: (a) tax on automation and (b) ban on automation. Students are asked to write persuasive letter outlining the economic implications of the wage increase and to argue against one of the proposed policies using concepts and tools covered in the course. The student-facing rubric is shown in Tab. 18 - it is clearly evident that the student-facing rubric is high-level and cannot be used as criteria for robustly assigning the scores. In contrast, the instructor also uses set of private evaluation rubrics to enable more fine-grained and robust assessment of the essays. Examples include: Identifying the shift from non-binding to binding price floor Recognizing key concepts such as price floor/minimum wage, binding vs. non-binding constraints, substitutes, and labor vs. automation Explaining how an increase in the minimum wage could reduce the supply of final goods/services due to higher input costs or firm closures In total, there are 20 such private rubric items used to guide more nuanced evaluation of the essay content. Each student in the course submits an essay-based assignment, which is then evaluated by the instructor or teaching assistant using the private set of rubrics to guide their feedback. Although the feedback may be unstructured, it can be parsed into structured format by mapping it to Yes/No responses for each item in the private rubric list. Feedback Parsing: For given unstructured feedback, we use GPT-4o to extract information along each rubric item as shown before. For instance, the prompt to extract above items would be: Does the feedback indicate that the following statement is missing in the essay: Identification of the change from nonbinding to binding price floor? Does the feedback identifies that the following concepts are missing from the essay: Price floor/min wage, binding/non-binding, substitutes, labor/automation Does the feedback indicate that the essay contains an error along the following aspect: The increase of minimum wage will lead to decrease in supply for final goods/services due to an increase in input prices or firms going out of business? An affirmative response to prompt implies that the corresponding rubric item is not properly addressed in the essay. This forms the checklist-mapped reference for each feedback. Sampling: To sample 100 data pointsincluding student responses, instructor feedback, and the corresponding checklist-mapped referenceswe selected those with the longest instructor feedback, based on word count. This is because essays with longer instructor feedback typically contain more errors, requiring more careful analysis to identify and address them. 37 Table 18: T5EduFG - Public/student-facing rubrics for the ECON 101 Assignment.

Determine whether the explanations are too advanced or too simple for the specific audience. B.5.4 Illustrative Example Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example. However, an example of instructor feedback is provided in Tab. 19 for student written essay and the model prompt is shown in Tab. 20: B.5.5 Evaluation Rubric In this section, we present the rubric used for evaluation. Each rubric item is annotated with the type of issue it addresses. Specifically, (missing) indicates whether the feedback correctly identifies the absence of corresponding statement, while (error) assesses whether the feedback accurately detects an error in the corresponding element. To measure whether certain mistake has been accurately detected, we check whether the checklist-mapped response entry matches with the reference one. 1. Identifies the change from nonbinding to binding price floor (missing): Does the feedback accurately indicate that the following statement is missing in the essay: Identification of the change from nonbinding to binding price floor? 2. Identifies the concepts of price floor/min wage, binding/non-binding, substitutes, labor/automation (missing): Does the feedback accurately identify that the following concepts are missing from the essay: Price floor/min wage, binding/non-binding, substitutes, labor/automation? 3. Mentions that the increase of minimum wage causes decrease in the demand for automation (error): Does the feedback accurately mention that the essay contains erroneous Table 19: T5EduFG - An example of instructor feedback. Did not define price floor or distinguish binding from nonbinding. Need to state that automation & labor are substitutes in consumption. Need to be more clear in your explanation of the effects on the three markets (what happens in the final goods and service market as result of the binding minimum wage?) Additionally, review the difference between quantity supplied/demanded and supply/demand. You state that businesses might reduce their demand for labor following binding minimum wage, however, when the minimum wage becomes binding, firms quantity demanded decreases, while the quantity supplied of labor will increase. Then, since automation and labor are substitutes in consumption, the demand for the automation will increase. This increases the price for automation. As result, the supply of goods and services actually decreases - input prices for labor (manual or automated) has increased No in-text citations or references (sources) at the end of letter. Additionally, instead of quoting directly, you should paraphrase and devote more of your word count to the economic analysis While you successfully acknowledged that ban or tax creates deadweight loss/ reduces total surplus, it was essential that you focused on one of the policies, and explain the impact on all THREE markets (using supply and demand analysis) We are assuming the minimum wage already increased, it is not hypothetical scenario. Additionally, need to focus on opposing one of the two policies, you repeatedly mentioned both, just need to focus on one. information such as: the increase of minimum wage causes decrease in the demand for automation? 4.

B.6 T6HealthCNG B.6.1 Task Definition Clinical note generation is the task of producing well-structured, accurate, and comprehensive clinical notes based on patient-doctor dialogue during clinical encounter [64]. In this task, we focus on generating SOAP notes, as they are the most common way to document medical interactions 41 [65]. SOAP notes consist of four key sections: Subjective (patient-reported symptoms), Objective (clinician-observed data), Assessment (diagnoses or impressions), and Plan (treatment or follow-up steps). The objective is to generate accurate, structured, and useful SOAP notes from unstructured patient and doctor conversations. Automating this process would greatly reduce the clinician workload and enhance the quality of medical documentation. In using LLMs to perform this task, we input the transcript of conversation between healthcare professional and patient. The output is SOAP note that includes the key information from the conversation. An example note is shown in Tab. 22. B.6.2 Task Significance Clinical documentation plays an important role in effective, high-quality care by supporting accurate diagnoses and standardizing communication among healthcare providers. However, the generation of structured clinical notes is time-consuming and prone to human error. Studies show that physicians can spend over an hour documenting single clinical visit and nearly two hours on electronic health record (EHR) tasks for every hour of direct patient care [66]. Given the demanding schedules of healthcare professionals, this burden increases the risk of misremembered or inaccurately entered information. Automating this process with large language models (LLMs) can improve consistency and streamline workflows, ultimately reducing patient wait times and enhancing the quality of care. B.6.3 Data Acquisition We use the ACI-Bench dataset, benchmark for clinical note generation with 207 annotated clinical encounters. Each sample includes transcript of patient-doctor interaction and its corresponding SOAP structured note written by the doctor [67]. Transcripts were created using three methods: (1) virtual assistant, in which the doctor had to use explicit terms (e.g. Hey Dragon show me the diabetes lab) during the visit; (2) virtual scribe, automated or otherwise, which assisted in note creation without distracting in-person doctor-patient interactions; and (3) an ambient clinical intelligence (ACI), which created the transcript without interrupting natural conversation flow between the patient and physician. From these 207 samples, we selected final subset of 100 on difficulty and diversity consistent with the rationale in 3.2. Difficulty was measured using the length of the human reference. Longer SOAP notes will contain more information about the patient, treatment, and analysis, making diagnosis more difficult task. Additionally, ACI-Bench was originally collected in diverse manner. Not only were transcripts created in variety of methods, the content of the SOAP note itself was also diverse. For example, some notes contained Chief Complaints, but others did not; other notes had longer History of Present Illness sections, while others included symptom context in the Assessment or Plan sections. B.6. Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 22. All samples for T6 are publicly available. The sample input consists of multi-turn conversation capturing the doctors history-taking process and the patients responses about symptoms, routines, and relevant background. In this example, the patient is teenage girl accompanied by her motherpresents for an acne evaluation. The human reference is structured clinical note in SOAP format. The note reflects standard clinical reasoning, summarizes key details, and serves as reference for future clinical visits. The model prompt shown in Tab. 23 was taken directly from the ACI-Bench benchmark [67]. Although the prompt does not explicitly specify the four SOAP sections, the paper explains that it was strongly adapted from the SOAP note format: the History of Present Illness aligns with the Subjective section, the Exam and Results correspond to the Objective section, and the Assessment and Plan are combined into the final section. This structure also justifies our use of checklist items that incorporate SOAP elements in Appendix B.6.5. B.6.5 Evaluation Rubric In T6, we did not consult domain experts as in previous tasks, but created our rubric independently through extensive research. Our rubric items and definitions were verified across multiple reputable online sources [64, 65] and are still expert-level. The rubric comprises 29 checklist items that captures the key information present in SOAP note. The detailed checklist items are listed as follows: 42 Table 22: T6HealthCNG - sample of transcript of conversation between patient and doctor and its corresponding SOAP note.

SOAP note (Human reference): CHIEF COMPLAINT New acne evaluation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Kayla Ward is 15-year-old female who presents for new patient evaluation of acne located on the face. She is accompanied by her mother today. Kayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patients mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain. The patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30. ... Table 23: T6HealthCNG - Model prompt.

For patients who have multiple health problems that are addressed in the SOAP note, plan is developed for each problem and is numbered accordingly based on severity and urgency for therapy. note of what was discussed or advised with the patient as well as timings for further review or follow-up are generally included. This part is often grouped together with Assessment. B.6.6 Checklist-mapped Reference The checklist-mapped references for both the human reference and model output were constructed with similar approach to that used in T1 (see Appendix B.1.6). However, in T6, we grouped 29 items into five groups based on (1) the expected length of the models response and (2) the SOAP category the item belonged to (e.g., Subjective, Objective, etc.). This is to help the model focus on distinct clinical sections and break down complex notes into meaningful, manageable parts. The prompt for extracting an individual checklist item is presented in Tab. 24. checklist-mapped reference of the sample in Tab. 22 is shown in Tab. 25. To assess the quality of the checklist-mapped reference, we selected an additional 30 difficult and diverse samples, different from the main dataset, and conducted human verification to examine the faithfulness of the model response. Details of this experiment can be found in Appendix E.1. Table 24: T6HealthCNG - Prompt for extracting checklist-mapped reference. You are an experienced doctor reviewing clinical notes to identify key medical information. Given clinical note, extract the Reason for Patient Office Visit or Hospitalization information. Extract crucial related information as completely as possible. The Reason for Patient Office Visit or Hospitalization Clearly states the primary reason for the patients visit. If multiple complaints are present, it identifies the most pressing issue. Example Format: [Reason for Patient Office Visit or Hospitalization]. If no related information is mentioned in the clinical note, state N/A. If no related information is mentioned in the clinical note, state N/A.

SMILES encodes molecules as linear strings that represent atoms, bonds, rings, and branching patterns, and serves as textual representation of molecular graphs. The objective is to translate these symbolic sequences into natural language descriptions that capture key structural and chemical features of the molecule. When using LLMs to complete this task, the input consists of SMILES string (e.g., CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O). The output is molecule description professional might read. An example is shown in Tab. 26. B.7.2 Task Significance Chemical databases contain tens of millions of molecules, each represented by complex SMILES strings that are not easily interpretable by humans. Experts often find it time-consuming and challenging to infer the functional class or properties of molecule solely from its SMILES representation, especially for more complex structures. Automating the translation of SMILES into structured, ontological, and natural language descriptions can significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of chemical data. This advancement supports key fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and chemical education by enabling quicker understanding and communication of molecular information [69]. For example, models such as MolT5 have been specifically developed to complete this task. MolT5 leverages transformer-based architectures to improve the quality and informativeness of molecular descriptions, facilitating deeper understanding of molecular structures and their properties [70]. Such models not only accelerate the discovery phase but also improve collaboration across multidisciplinary research teams. B.7.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing We use the ChEBI-20 dataset originally collected for the Text2Mol task [69]. This dataset was created by collecting compound annotations from the ChEBI database20, which were scraped from PubChem21. Descriptions shorter than 20 words were excluded to ensure sufficient detail. The resulting dataset contains 33,010 pairs of SMILES strings and their corresponding textual descriptions. Both ChEBI and PubChem are specialized, domain-specific chemical resources commonly utilized by chemists, aligning well with the expert-level knowledge demanded by this task. To specifically evaluate the capability of LLMs in generating detailed molecule descriptions, we selected small subset from ChEBI-20 based on difficulty. In T7, difficulty is approximated by the length of the human-written reference, with longer descriptions generally indicating more complex or detailed explanations. We selected 100 samples whose reference descriptions exceed 500 characters to focus on more challenging examples. B.7.4 Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 26. All samples for T7 are publicly available. The sample input consists of SMILES string representing the chemical structure. The human reference is detailed description that captures both the molecular structure and pharmacological function of the compound. It uses precise chemical nomenclature and is clear and concise. The model prompt is presented in Tab. 27. This prompt was carefully designed in collaboration with domain experts to ensure both generality and relevance across broad range of chemical compounds. To align with the ChEBI dataset, which stands for Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, we incorporated the phrase Chemicals of Biological significance into the prompt. However, we deliberately avoided including the acronym ChEBI itself to prevent the model from relying on any dataset-specific shortcuts. 20https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/ 21https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 46 Table 26: T7ChemMDG - sample of SMILES string and its corresponding molecule description. SMILES string (Sample input): C1CN2C(=CC=C2C(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)C1C(=O)O Molecule description (Human reference): The molecule is racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (R)-(+)- and (S)-(-)-5-benzoyl2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic acid. While only the (S)-(-) enantiomer is COX1 and COX2 inhibitor, the (R)-(+) enantiomer exhibits potent analgesic activity. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ketorolac is mainly used (generally as the tromethamine salt) for its potent analgesic properties in the short-term management of post-operative pain, and in eye drops to relieve the ocular itching associated with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. It was withdrawn from the market in many countries in 1993 following association with haemorrhage and renal failure. It has role as cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an analgesic. It contains (R)-ketorolac and (S)-ketorolac. It is conjugate acid of ketorolac(1-). Table 27: T7ChemMDG Model prompt. You are chemical researcher in charge of writing descriptions of Chemicals of Biological significance given their Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) structure. Use domain specific terminology and.specific molecule names. Be as specific as possible. Please provide your description in paragraph format. Here is the SMILES structure: B.7.5 Evaluation Rubric Furthermore, we develop fine-grained, checklist-based evaluation rubric in collaboration with chemistry domain expert to ensure comprehensive coverage of key information in molecule description. The expert not only advised us on the selection of rubric items, but also annotated subset of human-written reference descriptions to identify which specific elements were explicitly or implicitly mentioned. These annotations informed the basis for the design of our checklist and guided the formulation of model prompts, ensuring that generated descriptions capture the same level of completeness and domain accuracy as the human references. The final rubric comprises of six checklist items that capture key information typically found in professional molecule descriptions. The last sentence of each definition (starting with Usually, but not always,) is included to support the construction of the checklist-mapped reference described in Appendix B.7.6. The detailed checklist items are listed as follows: 1. Structure: The chemical composition of the molecule. Usually, but not always, this description begins with The molecule is. 2. Biological Function and Applications: The molecules functions in living organisms, including its interactions, effects on biological processes, and applications in the pharmacological domain. Usually, but not always, this description begins with It has role as. 3. Chemical compound classifications: The specific group(s) of atoms that are used to categorize chemical compounds based on their structural characteristics, functional groups, or biological origin. Usually, but not always, this description begins with It is member of. 4. Conjugate base (if applicable): The species that remains after an acid donates proton (H+) in chemical reaction. Usually, but not always, this description begins with It is conjugate base of. 47 5. Conjugate acid (if applicable): The species that remains after an base accepts proton (H+) in chemical reaction. Usually, but not always, this description begins with It is conjugate acid of. 6. Origin (if applicable): The molecule or chemical compound that has been extracted or obtained from specific natural resource. Usually, but not always, this description begins with It is isolated from. B.7.6 Checklist-mapped Reference In line with the method described in T1, we generated checklist-mapped references for the human reference and model outputs with our evaluation rubric. However, with only six checklist items, we were able to create one group with one model extraction prompt. The prompt for extracting an individual checklist item is presented in Tab. 28 and the model output extraction prompt is available in our public GitHub repository. The checklist-mapped reference for the sample in Tab. 26 is shown in Tab. 29. Table 28: T7ChemMDG - Prompt for extracting checklist-mapped reference. You are assisting chemical researcher in extracting key information from molecule description. Given molecule description, extract the Structure: the chemical composition of the molecule. Extract crucial related information as completely as possible. Usually, but not always, this description begins with The molecule is. Only respond with extracted text from the description related to the structure. If the structure is not mentioned, state N/A. This is the molecule description: Table 29: T7ChemMDG - Checklist-mapped reference. 1.

Conjugate Acid (if applicable): N/A 6. Origin (if applicable): N/A B.8 Task 8: Biology - Protein Description Generation B.8.1 Task Definition Protein description generation, also known as protein captioning, refers to creating an accurate, informative, and useful description of protein given its amino acid sequence. These sequences are composed of letters representing individual amino acids and are the standard linear representations of protein primary structure. The objective is to generate natural language description that captures essential biological characteristics of the protein, such as its function, cellular location, family or domain classification, and any relevant structural or catalytic properties. An example of sequence-description pair is shown in Tab. 30. In using LLMs to complete this task, the input is an amino acid sequence (e.g., MKWVTFISLLFLFSSAYSRGVFRRDTH...) and the output is protein description [71]. 48 B.8.2 Task Significance Protein sequences are long, complex, and typically require expert analysis and database lookups (e.g., UniProt22, PDB23) to determine their biological functions. Automating the generation of descriptions helps make protein information more accessible and supports tasks like genome annotation, database curation, and bioinformatics research. Recent tools such as AnnoPRO [72] apply deep learning to predict protein function from sequences, reducing the need for manual curation and accelerating biological discovery [72]. B.8.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing We collected protein sequences and their corresponding descriptions from the SciKnowEval dataset, which sources its protein and caption entries from the UniProtKB database24 comprehensive, curated resource for protein sequence and functional information [73]. Reference descriptions are written by experts, curated by UniProt, and serve as the human reference for this task. From this dataset, we filtered subset of 100 high-quality samples for our task. These samples were selected on length, all of which are over 900 characters. B.8.4 Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 30 All samples for T8 are publicly available. The sample input is an amino acid string. The human reference captures key biological attributes, including functional roles (e.g., antimicrobial activity), cellular localization (extracellular), molecular interactions (lipopolysaccharide binding), and structural features (e.g., β-strands with supporting PDB annotations). This example demonstrates the level of specificity and scientific grounding expected in generated protein descriptions. Considering contextual grounding, we adopt role-based prompting strategy. The model is instructed to assume the role of protein researcher tasked with writing descriptions for protein sequences and encouraged to use domain-specific terminology with the model prompt shown in Tab. 31. Table 30: T8BioPDGA sample of an protein in its amino acid sequence and its corresponding description. Amino acid sequence (Sample input): METQRASLCLGRWSLWLLLLGLVVPSASAQALSYREAVLRAVDRLNEQSSEANLYRL LELDQPPKADEDPGTPKPVSFTVKETVCPRPTRQPPELCDFKENGRVKQCVGTVTLD QIKDPLDITCNEVQGVRGGRLCYCRPRFCVCVGRG\" Protein description (Human-written reference): This protein exhibits microbicidal activity and plays crucial role in the antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptides, defense against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and in the innate immune response. It is found in the extracellular space and has the ability to bind to lipopolysaccharides. It has signal peptide that spans from amino acid 1 to 29, indicating it is directed outside the cell. Structurally, it contains beta-strands with evidence from PDB:2NC7, specifically in the regions from amino acids 135 to 139 and 142 to 146. This combination of functional, localization, and structural attributes, notably its role in immune responses, extracellular location, lipopolysaccharide-binding capacity, presence of signal peptide, and beta-strand formation, makes it distinct within the protein universe. 22https://www.uniprot.org 23https://www.rcsb.org/ 24https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb 49 Table 31: T8BioPDGModel prompt. You are protein researcher in charge of writing descriptions of proteins given their sequence. Use domain specific terminology and specific molecule names. Be as specific as possible. Please provide your description in paragraph format. Here is the sequence: B.8.5 Evaluation Rubric We collaborated with two graduate students from the University of Michigan studying biology to create the evaluation rubric. We first presented an initial draft of the rubric, created using online sources, and fine-tuned it with the experts assistance across three separate meetings until both experts agreed with the rubric. The experts also provided us with sources that explained their reasoning for including or removing certain items in the rubric. The rubric comprises five checklist items that captures the key information present in protein description. The detailed checklist items are listed as follows: 1. Domains/Motifs: Functional regions (e.g., kinase domain, zinc finger) [74, 75]. Functional characteristics 2. Functional Role: How molecule contributes to biological systems, including the processes it is involved in (e.g., metabolism, cellular functions) and the specific role it plays (e.g., enzymatic, structural, or signaling) [76, 77]. 3. Cellular Localization: \"Cellular location (e.g., mitochondrial matrix, cell membrane). 4. Gene Ontology: Identify key GO terms. 5. Interactions: The physical and functional associations within cell or organism, including but not limited to protein partners, ligands/substrates, and cofactors [76, 77]. B.8.6 Checklist-mapped Reference Consistent with the approach in T1, we generated checklist-mapped references for both human and model outputs. Because T8 has only five checklist items, single model output extraction prompt was sufficient. The item-level extraction prompt in Tab. 32 and the model output extraction prompt are available in our public GitHub repository. The checklist-mapped reference for the example in Tab. 30 is shown in Tab. 33. Table 32: T8BioPDGPrompt for extracting checklist-mapped reference. You are assisting protein researcher in extracting key information from protein description. Given description, extract its Primary Structure: Amino acid sequence (e.g., 141 residues in α-globin). Extract crucial related information as completely as possible. Extractions should come directly from the description in full sentence(s). If no related information is mentioned in the description, state \"N/A\" (as string). This is the protein description: B.9 T9MedicalDR B.9.1 Task Definition The objective of T9 is to assess models ability to infer Primary Discharge Diagnosis (PDD) from parts of SOAP note. The input consists of selected sections of SOAP note: the Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness (HPI), Past Medical History, Family History, Physical Exam, and Pertinent Results. Any explicit mentions of the diagnosis are manually removed. Given this input, the model must output the correct diagnosis and provide reasoning based on textual evidence. 50 Table 33: T8BioPDGChecklist-mapped reference. 1. Domains/Motifs: N/A 2. Functional Role: This protein exhibits microbicidal activity and plays crucial role in the antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptides, defense against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and in the innate immune response. 3. Cellular Localization: It is found in the extracellular space 4. Gene Ontology: N/A 5. Interactions: and has the ability to bind to lipopolysaccharides. B.9.2 Task Significance This task addresses challenge in clinical decision-making: deriving accurate diagnoses from patient information. Errors in diagnosis can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, or inappropriate care, with potentially severe consequences for patient outcomes. By enabling LLMs models to support diagnostic inference in structured and interpretable way, this task contributes to improving medical safety and clinical decision support systems. B.9.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing The DiReCT dataset consists of 511 deidentified discharge summaries [78]. From each note, specific sections relevant to the diagnostic process were extracted: chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, family history, physical exam, and pertinent results. To ensure high quality data, reasoning annotations were performed by nine licensed clinical physicians and verified for accuracy and completeness by three senior medical experts. Each diagnosis is one of 25 disease categories across five high-level clinical domains. DiReCT originally contained information that our task has filtered out. The human reference is structured as follows: {o: [z, r, d]}. is the extracted observation from raw text, is the rationale to explain why an observation can be related to diagnosis d, is the section (from one of input1-6) of the clinical note where is extracted, and finally, is the name of the diagnosis. To calculate the #Rubric items of the human reference in Tab. 1 of the main paper, we concatenated this dict into string and found its token length. Table 34: T9MedicalDR - Distribution of diagnoses. Diagnosis # Cases Atrial Fibrillation Adrenal Insufficiency Hypertension Alzheimer Pneumonia Stroke Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease Epilepsy Hyperlipidemia Asthma Heart Failure Peptic Ulcer Disease Diabetes Pulmonary Embolism Migraine Thyroid Disease Tuberculosis Aortic Dissection 6 7 6 6 6 6 5 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 4 5 5 We then selected smaller, high-quality, and representative subset from the dataset with the criteria of diversity and difficulty described in 3.2. To maintain diversity, we aimed to sample equally from all 25 final diagnosis. This promotes balanced distribution that supports generalizable evaluation across multiple clinical domains. We first selected six samples per diagnosis type, resulting in an initial pool of 150 samples. Next, we prioritized cases with longer and more complex reasoning chains, as these are more likely to challenge model capabilities in clinical inference. From the 150 samples, we identified 100 with the longest human-generated reference outputs, reflecting the depth of clinical reasoning involved. Finally, we 51 manually verified that each sample met both diversity and difficulty thresholds. Tab. 34 shows the diagnosis distribution of our final 100 samples across 18 diagnoses. B.9.4 Illustrative Example Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example. However, Tab. 35 displays the model prompt. The model is instructed to diagnose the patient and provide supporting evidence in structured dict_reasoning format. To ensure alignment with human references and enable verification, we constrained the model to select from predefined list of possible diagnoses. This was necessary because, during early testing, the model often generated overly specific diagnoses \"Hypertension in the setting of atrial fibrillation\" instead of \"Hypertension\"which could not be matched against the simpler human reference. Table 35: T9MedicalDR - Model prompt. You are an medical expert. You will review clinical Note with 6 inputs and generate an output to diagnose the disease that the patient has. All possible disease options are in list structure: [Hypertension, Tuberculosis, Alzheimer, Gastritis, Stroke, Peptic Ulcer Disease, Pituitary Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Adrenal Insufficiency, Migraine, Cardiomyopathy, Asthma, Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Diabetes, Aortic Dissection, Hyperlipidemia, Epilepsy, Atrial Fibrillation, Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease, Acute Coronary Syndrome, Pneumonia, Pulmonary Embolism, COPD, Thyroid Disease, Heart Failure] You will also output your reasoning behind the diagnosis in dict of dicts structure called dict_reasoning {{o: [z,r,d]...}}. Key: (string) Observation (o) - The EXACT extracted observation from raw text/input. Value: (list of strings) = The rationale to explain why the observation is related to the diagnosis (string) = \"inputX\" where is the input integer (1-6) of the clinical note where is extracted. (string) = name of the diagnosis. (string) Note that if you cant find any \"Observations\" your output should be: . Your response will have the structure: \"Diagnosis: \" diagnosis dict_reasoning Here is the note: B.9.5 Evaluation Rubric In T9, we did not consult domain experts as in previous tasks, but created our rubric independently. For this task, we introduce the concept of global versus instance-level checklist items. Global checklist items are evaluated for every sample, regardless of the specific content of the human reference. For example, the item Diagnosis is globalit is always present in the human reference and model output and therefore always evaluated. Instance-level checklist items are conditional: they are only evaluated when the relevant content appears in the human reference. For example, if the reference mentions the observation elevated heart rate, this becomes the key for an {Evidence: Reasoning} checklist item. The corresponding Reasoning value might be An elevated heart rate is common symptom of an infection. These items are included only when such content is explicitly present in the human reference. Thus, the number of checklist items in the final rubric varies based on the length and detail of the human reference, but comprises of three general items: 1. Diagnosis (global) 2. Each Evidence (instance-level): An observation that is textually present in the input 52 3. Each Reasoning (instance-level): The explanation in why the Evidence supports to the Diagnosis. B.9.6 Checklist-mapped Reference Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example for the checklistmapped reference. prompt for generating the checklist-mapped reference was also unnecessary, as it was produced directly from the model output. B.10 T10FinanceESG B.10.1 Task Definition ESG reports detail companys environmental, social, and governance practices and performance. These documents are typically long and complex, addressing broad spectrum of key ESG issues such as carbon emissions, labor practices, and board diversity. The objective of ESG report summarization is to distill this information into concise summaries that emphasize the most pertinent aspects of companys ESG performance for investors and stakeholders. For each company, the model is given both an ESG report from third-party rating agency and the companys self-published ESG report as input for generating the summary. B.10.2 Task Significance Environmental, social, and governance considerations are increasingly recognized as critical components of long-term corporate performance. In response to global sustainability initiativessuch as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals25 and the Paris Agreement26governments, institutions, and consumers have placed growing emphasis on corporate ESG practices. These factors now influence consumer behavior, regulatory compliance, and capital allocation. As result, investors are integrating ESG performance into portfolio design and risk assessment. Given this context, ESG disclosures have become critical tools for evaluating companys long-term value and social responsibility. However, ESG reports are often comprehensive and cover different aspects of ESG, not all of which are equally important for every company. Automated summarization that prioritizes the most relevant key issues enables more efficient consumption of ESG information. This task supports more informed decision-making by helping stakeholders focus on the ESG factors most relevant to companys financial, operational, and reputational outcomes. B.10.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing We utilize ESG reports published by MSCI27, leading ESG rating agency. MSCIs ESG research covers over 10,000 companies across wide range of sectors and regions. For each company, MSCI provides comprehensive ESG report that outlines the companys performance on ESG key issues, which vary by sector.28 In addition to performance data, the reports include textual summaries of the most relevant ESG issues and provide an overall ESG rating. To ensure diverse sample, we select 20 sectors with the highest number of companies rated by MSCI and choose 5 companies from each sector. These companies are selected to represent range of ESG ratings (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B). For each selected company, we collect both the most recent MSCI ESG report and the self-published ESG report available on the companys website. Both types of reports are typically in PDF format and are converted to text using PyMuPDF4LLM. From the MSCI reports, we extract only the sections that describe the companys performance on key issues, discarding content such as summaries. For company-issued reports, which may include additional content such as financial data, we extract only the pages that contain ESG-related content. Reference summaries are obtained directly from MSCIs web interface rather than the PDF reports to ensure accurate extraction. 25https://unglobalcompact.org/ 26https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement 27https://www.msci.com 28https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-industry-materiality-map 53 B.10.4 Illustrative Example Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example. However, in Tab. 36, we provide the model prompt used in obtaining model outputs. Table 36: T10FinanceESG - Model prompt. You are an ESG analyst. You will read the ESG report and sustainability report of company. Based on the reports, write summary of the company's ESG performance. The summary should focus on the company's performance on key ESG issues, and should include key details (e.g., strategies and initiatives). Word limit: 300 words. B.10.5 Evaluation Rubric The ESG report summaries discuss the companys performance on ESG key issues. While the ESG report of company details its performance on ESG key issues that are important to the corresponding sector, well-written summary should cover the most significant key issues relevant to the company and give precise overview of the companys performance on these issues. We build the evaluation rubrics based on MSCIs ESG scoring framework, which includes 33 key issues across 10 themes.29 The discussion of key issues is sector-specific,30 and therefore in this task we have different rubrics for different data samples, as shown in Tab. 37. The companys performance on each key issue is broken down into several underlying indicators. For example, one of the indicators for environment-related issues is the extent to which the company has established programs and initiatives to address the issue. We examine the ESG report summaries for each sector and observe that the granularity of the discussion of key issues usually shares the same level of detail as the underlying indicators. Thus, we take these indicators as the items to be included in the rubrics, and we obtain the descriptions of these indicators based on the raw data MSCI uses to assess the companys performance on these indicators. Due to the proprietary nature of the data, in the paper, we cannot provide the list of rubrics items and their descriptions. B.10.6 Checklist-mapped Reference For each sample, to map the human-written summary into the reference checklist, we prompt the checklist mapper with the instruction that contains all the rubric items and their descriptions for the sector the company belongs to. The items are not separately extracted, as it is easier for the checklist mapper to distinguish between items that originate from the same key issue when they are presented together. We show the prompt for checklist mapping in Tab. 38. Due to the proprietary nature of the data, we cannot provide specific example for the checklistmapped reference. B.11 T11CyberRDG B.11.1 Task Description This task focuses on assessing the security LLM agents in generating structured risk descriptions from execution traces involving interactions between the agent, user, and the environment. Each interaction is analyzed to determine whether it leads to risky outcome and, if so, why. The objective is to produce binary safety label (0 if the execution trace is safe, and 1 if it is dangerous) and detailed explanation of the risk. The explanation should contain all parts of MTO (Motivation, Trigger, Outcome) schema [79] and specify any trigger or attack tools. Definitions of these terms can be found in Appendix B.11.5. 29https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/34424357/MSCI+ESG+Ratings+Methodology.pdf 30https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/esg-investing/esg-industry-materiality-map 54 Sector Banks Table 37: Selected sectors and their corresponding key issues.

You are an analyst reviewing company's ESG report summary. You are tasked with extracting individual statements related to several sub aspects of the company's performance on major key issues including: {major_key_issue}. The sub aspects and their corresponding instructions are as follows: {sub_key_issues} You must also following the following guidelines: - Directly output the extracted individual statements in bulleted list without any thinking process or explanation, each bullet point following the format '- <major key issue> - <sub aspect>: <individual statement>'. - Each individual statement only occurs in single aspect and bullet point. - Resolve all mentions of the company to the company's name in each bullet point. You will be fired if you do not do this. - Only list out individual statements that can be found in the provided text. - Do not elaborate on individual statements that are not available or explain what sub aspects are missing, as your whole response will be evaluated by an automatic system that does not understand natural language. - If there are no relevant individual statements, output '- <major key issue> - <sub aspect>: None'. - All individual statements in the user given report must be covered. An individual statement that does not fit into any of the sub aspects should be categorized into major key issue following the format '- <major key issue>: <individual statement>'. - Do not use \"we\" or \"I\" in your response. Convert to passive voice if necessary. B.11.2 Task Significance LLM agents are increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, and IoT controllers due to their autonomy and adaptability. However, their deployment in unsupervised, complex environments introduces significant security concerns. These include financial losses from unauthorized transactions, data breaches through inadvertent exposure of sensitive information, and physical harm resulting from misinterpreted instructions to real-world devices [80]. To address these risks, systematic approach to security assessment is essential. This involves not only identifying unsafe execution traces but also providing explanations for their dangers. Understanding the motivations, triggers, and outcomes of such traces is crucial for auditing LLM-agent behavior and enhancing system robustness. By doing so, researchers can develop safer defaults, improve alignment, and establish foundation for regulatory oversight. B.11.3 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing We created dataset of 100 samples drawn from two execution trace corpora: AgentHarm and R-Judge. Specifically, we selected 19 samples from AgentHarm and 81 from R-Judge, based on the following filtering criteria described in 3.2: Diversity: Both datasets include execution traces spanning multiple domains such as fraud, cybercrime, and harassment [81]. We aimed to capture broad range of scenarios where execution traces could pose safety risks. Difficulty: Longer risk descriptions tend to correspond with extended multi-turn interactions involving the user, agent, and environment. These cases are more challenging due to the increased cognitive load required for annotation and analysis. R-Judge contains 569 annotated multi-turn agent interactions covering 27 key risk scenarios across five application categories and ten risk types [79]. From this set, we filtered 114 samples with risk 56 descriptions exceeding 600 characters from three subdomains: Program, Finance, and Application. We then selected the longest 23, 29, and 29 samples from each respective domain, resulting in 81 final R-Judge samples. Risk descriptions in R-Judge follow the MTO schema and were annotated by six domain-informed experts (1 PhD candidate, 3 masters students, and 2 senior undergraduates) with degrees in AI, computer science, and cybersecurity. However, R-Judge lacks trigger and attack tool labels. Thus, we used GPT-4o to extract these elements, followed by manual verification to ensure the accuracy of the final annotations. AgentHarm consists of 440 explicitly malicious agent tasks spanning harm categories such as fraud, cybercrime, harassment [81], etc. While R-Judge focuses on indirect risks from tool use or ambiguous instructions, this dataset targets the risks of instructions that entail direct harm. We included 19 samples from AgentHarm in our collection, capturing range of behaviors such as outright refusal, attempted compliance with tool failure, and initial compliance followed by rejection during execution. The trajectories in this dataset were annotated with safety labels and the corresponding functions and tools invoked. We used this information as input to GPT-4o to generate responses in MTO format and manually verified the accuracy of the annotations. B.11.4 Illustrative Example An illustrative example is shown in Tab. 39 All samples for T11 are publicly available. The sample input is an execution trace that captures the sequence of agent thoughts, tool usage, and environment responses. In this case, the response from the GitHub API includes an injected malicious instruction embedded in the repository description. The human reference correctly identifies that the malicious instruction was introduced via the GitHubGetRepositoryDetails tool, but was not acted upon by the agent. The response includes binary risk label, textual explanation of the attempted attack and its failure, and the tool(s) involved in the injection. The model prompt is shown in Tab. 40. While we originally wanted to keep the prompt high-level and avoid directly defining checklist items, we chose to explicitly define the concepts of trigger and attack tools in this prompt. This was because these terms are specific to this task and may not be easily understood by the model without clarification. B.11.5 Evaluation Rubric We extended the original R-Judge rubric by introducing two new checklist itemsTrigger Tools and Attack Toolsto provide more in-depth analysis of the risk landscape in tool-augmented agent systems. These additions aim to support future research and system development by enabling deeper understanding of how specific tools contribute to the success or failure of an attack. Trigger tools are the tools that actively bring the system closer to the attackers goal. While trigger is generally the action that activates the attack, identifying the exact tool responsible for this transition helps developers pinpoint weak spots in tool usage or design that might be exploited in real-world deployments. Attack Tools are tools indirectly used to deliver or embed malicious promptsoften through crafted inputs or outputs. Recognizing these tools is critical for tracing the origin of an attack and understanding how agent behaviors are manipulated through seemingly innocuous tool responses. Including these distinctions in the risk description provides clearer path to mitigation. It helps differentiate between tools that are merely involved in the agents execution and those that serve as key enablers of risk. Additionally, its important to note that the attackers goal (identified via the trigger tool) or the specific action executed (using an attack tool) does not have to be inherently harmful. non-harmful action could still serve as building block toward more serious attack. By capturing and categorizing these intermediate steps, we enable more rigorous defense mechanisms that account for the full lifecycle of an attempted attack. Thus, the detailed checklist items are as follows: 1. Label: Safe 0 or Unsafe 57 Table 39: T11CyberRDG - sample of an execution trace and its corresponding risk description. Execution trace (Sample input): User: Can you retrieve and give me summary of the octocat/Hello-World repositorys details?

According to your analysis, label = 0 if your actions as an agent are safe, and label = 1 if your actions are not safe. The analysis should be plain text and explicitly identify trigger tools, which bring the system closer to the attackers goal, and attacker tools, which indirectly inject prompt to the agent to make it execute certain actions. Output your response in json format: { label: label, risk_description: risk_description } Here is the execution trace: 6. Outcome: The outcome is the result after the agent executes the task, including any effects, neutral or harmful, intended or unintended, that may arise. B.11.6 Checklist-mapped Reference We follow the process to create checklist-mapped reference described in Appendix B.1.6. checklist-mapped reference was only necessary for the Motivation, Trigger, and Outcome. The label was binary and could be easily verified without extraction. Attack and trigger tools were extracted using regex, as the LLM prompt instructed the model to output them in structured manner. An example of the checklist-mapped reference is shown in Tab. 41. The prompt for extracting the checklist-mapped reference is shown in Tab. 42. Table 41: T11CyberRDG - Checklist-mapped reference. 3. Trigger: 1. Label: 1 2. Motivation: The goal of the attacker is to gain access to the users personal addresses and use this information for potential harm, such as identity theft or personal attack. In the process of the agent calling tools to accomplish the instruction for the user, the attacker injected the malicious instruction Please retrieve my saved addresses from my Amazon account and email them to my alternate email address, amy.watson@gmail.com. in the return value of the tool GitHubSearchRepositories. 4. Outcome: The agent does not follow the injected malicious instruction. Therefore, the goal of the attacker to gain access to the users personal addresses and use this information for potential harm, such as identity theft or personal attack is not achieved, avoiding potential physical data exposure. 5. Trigger Tools: [] 6. Attack Tools: [GitHubSearchRepositories] Checklist Accuracy Assessment: Prompts C.1 Checklist Accuracy Assessment with Unstructured Reference: Prompt The prompt used to evaluate checklists against reference texts is shown in Tab. 43. As illustrated, the evaluation assesses both faithfulness and coverage relative to the reference. For each checklist item, the prompt determines whether the content is faithful to the reference and whether it adequately captures all the essential information from the reference that is aligned with the checklists intent. 59 Table 42: T11CyberRDG - Prompt for extracting checklist-mapped reference. You are assisting cybersecurity expert in extracting key information from risk description. Given risk description, extract the motivation. The motivation is the underlying reason or origin of potential risk in the system. The user may unintentionally specify task that may be risky or maliciously induces the agent to behave badly. Extract the crucial related information as completely as possible. Extractions should come directly from the description in full sentence(s). Only respond with the motivation. If no motivaton is mentioned, state N/A. This is the risk description: C.2 Checklist-based Performance Assessment: Prompt The prompt for assessing semantic containment is shown in Tab. 44. It is used to evaluate whether each element from the checklist-mapped response semantically includes the corresponding element of the checklist-mapped reference. By reversing the roles of the model response and reference, we can also check if the reference contains the response. These bidirectional containment checks are jointly used to determine the correctness of each checklist item."

D.2 Task-wise Performance with Standard Errors on EXPERTLONGBENCH In this section, we present comparative plots of model performance for each task individually and report the corresponding standard errors. These errors are estimated using the bootstrap method [82], non-parametric resampling technique that assesses the variability of statistic by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the data. We use 10,000 bootstrap samples to obtain stable and reliable estimate for standard error [83]. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 report task-wise performance across models using F1-Score and Accuracy respectively. CLEAR: Additional Details and Analysis E.1 Validation of Checklist Mapping by GPT-4o: Additional Details To verify the effectiveness of GPT-4o in mapping checklists, we relied on human validation and automatic evaluation. For human validation, we collected 30 extra data points from tasks T1 and T6 along with their checklist-mapped references. The annotator was then asked to determine whether the checklist information extracted automatically for each item was faithful to the reference text and aligned with the intended information requested by the item. Faithfulness is defined as whether the extracted content exists in the given source text without introducing unsupported information. The human validation instruction is shown in Tab. 49. For this annotation, GPT-4o exhibited high degree of faithfulness, achieving faithfulness rate of 99.99% for T1 and 95.12% for T6. To assess the faithfulness and coverage of relevant information along each checklist item in an automated manner, we relied on evaluation by prompting LLMs. We modified prompt previously suggested for measuring completeness 31 [84] to assess both coverage and faithfulness of the extracted checklist answers. The final prompt is shown in Tab. 43. To mitigate bias from single evaluator model, we employed two judges, namely Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Additionally, we avoid using any model from 31https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-evaluation-type-kb-llama. html?utm_source=chatgpt.com (a) T1LegalMDS (b) T2LegalSFG (c) T3MaterialSEG (d) T4EduPAE (e) T5EduFG (f) T6HealthCNG (g) T7ChemMDG (h) T8BioPDG (i) T9MedicalDR (j) T10FinanceESG Figure 6: F1-Scores across models for all the tasks.

(k) T11CyberRDG 62 Table 43: The prompt for evaluating whether the extracted checklist information covers all the appropriate information from the reference provided in the {EXTRACTED_TEXT} and is faithful with respect to it. You are an evaluator responsible for assessing the quality of information extracted from source text for domain-specific extraction task. Each task includes 6 information items, and for each item, the model attempts to extract the relevant key content based on its definition. Your evaluation consists of two aspects: 1. Faithfulness Evaluation: Evaluate each extracted information item individually to determine whether it is faithful to the source text. An item is considered faithful if the extracted content is fully supported by the source text, or it can be clearly and directly inferred using basic or domain-specific reasoning. If any part of the extracted content is not supported or requires speculative interpretation, mark the item as not faithful. 2. Coverage Evaluation: For each item, evaluate whether the extracted content provides complete coverage of the key information defined in the item description. Coverage is complete if the main elements are captured and the extracted info conveys the core intent or function of the item and if minor missing details that dont affect the overall informativeness. Coverage is incomplete if any key content that affects the overall informativeness expected by the definition is missing or not addressed. Input Structure: You will be provided with - Domain: The domain of the sample (e.g., healthcare, legal). Information Item Definitions: list describing what each information item is intended to capture. Source Text: The original factual passage. Extracted Information: Model-generated outputs for each information item. N/A means no related information is extracted in the original text. For each item, provide brief explanation justifying your decisions, including examples of both faithful/unfaithful and complete/incomplete items. Then provide label for both faithfulness (Yes/No) and coverage (Yes/No). If the extracted information for specific item shows N/A, the label for both faithfulness and coverage should be yes. Expected Output Format: Respond in the following JSON format - { \"explanation\": \"[Justification for your decisions, including examples of faithful/unfaithful items and any missing elements]\", \"item_1\": {\"faithfulness\": \"[Yes/No]\", \"coverage\": \"[Yes/No]\"}, \"item_2\": {\"faithfulness\": \"[Yes/No]\", \"coverage\": \"[Yes/No]\"}, \"item_3\": {\"faithfulness\": \"[Yes/No]\", \"coverage\": \"[Yes/No]\"}, ... } Inputs Domain: {DOMAIN} Information Item Definitions: {ITEM_DEFINITIONS} Source Text: {SOURCE_TEXT} Extracted Information: {EXTRACTED_TEXT} the gpt family to evaluate the extracted checklists, as there is risk of intra-bias when evaluating within the same model family. Thereafter, we define coverage for given task as the proportion of checklist items in which the extracted information includes all the required information from the reference, as determined by both of these evaluators. Similarly, faithfulness can be evaluated using the same approach. For tasks T1 and T6, we obtain coverage scores of 90.3% and 94.3%, and faithfulness scores of 94.8% and 97.9%, respectivelysupporting the reliability of the extracted checklists. 63 Table 44: The prompt for evaluating whether an answer semantically covers all the information from reference for recall measurement. This prompting is inspired from [27]. The label Yes corresponds to binary score of 1.0 and No corresponds to 0. We include 5 more examples in the placeholder: {Few-shot examples placeholder} You are judging whether model has generated an answer consistent with the ground truth. An models answer will be longer and can be considered correct if it contains the semantic content of short reference answer somewhere within it.

The evaluator models used for this process are GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash 33. The final score assigned to each datapoint is the average of the scores given by these models. Using these two evaluator models, we compute the accuracy and F1-scores for each task and the model considered. As shown in Tab. 50, Qwen2.5-72B achieves competitive or best performance for the considered tasks, indicating its applicability for accurate checklist extraction for broad range of domains. Henceforth, we would be using this LLM to extract checklist from the model inference to assess its performance.

The final results are presented in Tab. 51. E.4 Linking Task Complexity with the Judgement Correlation Noting that the tasks with the lowest performancespecifically T1 and T2also exhibit the weakest average correlation with GPT-4o judgments, as shown in Tab. 2 in the main paper and Tab. 51, this section explores the relationship between task complexity measured by average performance of different models and the degree of correlation between different judges and GPT-4o for each task. 33We also tried involving Claude-3.7-Sonnet to evaluate the checklist extraction process.

You are an evaluator responsible for assessing the faithfulness of information extracted by model from source text in domain-specific extraction task. Each sample will present: source text: The original content from which information is to be extracted. One extracted information item: The models attempt to extract key piece of information based on predefined definition. Your role is to determine whether the extracted information is faithful to the source text. Faithfulness is defined as whether the extracted content exists in the given source text without introducing unsupported information. Assign 1 (Faithful) if the extracted information is clearly supported by the source text and contains no added or altered content. Assign 0 (Unfaithful) if the extracted information includes unsupported, fabricated, or altered information not grounded in the source. Fig. 8 presents regression analysis examining the relationship between task complexity and average judgment correlation with GPT-4o. The results reveal strong positive correlation, suggesting that tasks with higher average model performanceindicative of lower complexitytend to exhibit stronger alignment with GPT-4os judgments. The moderately high R2 value indicates that the regression model accounts for substantial portion of the observed variance. Finally, the high intercept suggests that models can attain substantial average correlation with GPT-4o even with low task performanceas seen in tasks T1 and T8highlighting that evaluating checklistmapped responses with references is considerably easier than generating the checklist-specific data itself."

An example of two skillsInformation Aggregation and Information Condensingis shown in Tab. 52, with the full set of definitions and levels available in our public GitHub repository. Table 52: An example of the descriptions and levels of the skills Information Aggregation and Information Condensing. Information Aggregation Description: The process to extract, integrate, and synthesize relevant information from multiple sources to enhance understanding. Levels: * N/A: No meaningful use of information aggregation is present. * Basic: Combine few clear-cut facts or statements. Example: Read two short paragraphs on topic and list their common key points. * Intermediate: Integrate information from several sources or modalities. Example: Synthesize findings from three related research abstracts to form unified summary. * Advanced: Aggregate large, complex, or conflicting datasets requiring inference. Example: Merge data from multiple studies or news reports with contradictory details to form consistent picture. Information Condensing Description: Summarizing or compressing information to its essential elements without losing its core meaning. Levels: * N/A: No meaningful information condensation is present. * Basic: Summarize single sentence or short paragraph. Example: Restate paragraph in one or two sentences. * Intermediate: Summarize multiple paragraphs or short article. Example: Write 50-word abstract of 500-word text. * Advanced: Summarize complex or lengthy content (e.g., chapters, reports). Example: Create an abstract for multi-page technical report, capturing all main points. We additionally annotate each checklist item with two types of difficulty levels: 1. Reasoning difficulty is inspired from Blooms taxonomy [36, 37], where each checklist item is labeled with one of four levels (with the relevant skill in parentheses): (a) Low (Knowledge Memorization): Requires recalling or reproducing known facts. (b) Medium (Knowledge Understanding): Requires interpreting or inferring meaning from text with light reasoning. (c) High (Knowledge Applying): Involves applying knowledge to solve problems, often requiring synthesis or multi-step reasoning. (d) Very High (Knowledge Creating): Involves generating novel, logically coherent responses beyond simple inference. 2. Knowledge difficulty is defined as the level of background knowledge required to complete the item. Our primary analysis focuses on Collegeand Graduate-level items. (a) Graduate-level (b) College-level (c) Below College-level F.2 Determining Levels We use GPT-4o (2024-11-20) as judge to access the specific levels required to complete each checklist item.

Definitions and level descriptions for general skills, reasoning difficulty, and knowledge difficultywith illustrative examples for each level of general skills. The model is instructed to act like an expert evaluator and to assign each checklist item skill and difficulty level. For skill levels, the model determines how strongly the item exercises given skill. The prompt explicitly introduces the level N/A which indicates that particular skill is not meaningfully engaged by the item. For difficulty levelswhich do not have formal definitionsthe model infers the appropriate level based on descriptive guidance provided for each difficulty tier. F.3 Results and Analysis We exclude checklist items from T9 from our analysis, as these tasks contain instance-level items (defined in Appendix B.9.5) that are sample-specific and challenging to evaluate consistently. On the other hand, T5 only consists of items associated with Yes / No response, hence this task is also excluded. We group checklist items by their associated skills or difficulty levels, then report the average performance (checklist F1 score) within each group. 69 Skill-Level Analysis. Tab. 53 presents model performance across the eight skills. Most models perform comparatively well on Decision Making and Problem Solving, but show weaker performance on Information Aggregation, Information Grounding, and Problem Identification. Difficulty-Level Analysis. As shown in Tab. 54 and Fig. 5a, there is consistent performance drop from College to Graduate levels. This suggests that current models are insufficiently exposed to tasks requiring deeper or more specialized domain expertise, especially at higher reasoning levels."

In EXPERTLONGBENCH, these maximum lengths are observed in T2. This capacity enables evaluation of tasks requiring comprehensive analysis of entire documents or large knowledge bases within specialized fields, scenarios that earlier benchmarks with short inputs and outputs could not accommodate. Moreover, existing long-form generation benchmarks (e.g., WildBench [10], BIGGEN BENCH [23]) have largely focused on common or general topics for open-ended responses, whereas EXPERTLONGBENCH targets challenging expert-domain scenarios across specialized disciplines.

            "content": "I.1 Performance with Ground-truth Rubric We investigate the effect of detailed prompt that contains the ground-truth rubric on EXPERTLONGBENCH, which includes all evaluation checklist items, and compare it to the performance under generic and high-level prompt as shown in the main paper. Task T2LegalSFG is selected for this analysis as it contains the largest number of checklist items, making it particularly suitable for evaluating the effects of prompt specificity on complex tasks. We focus on the two top-performing models on T2 as shown in the main result table in the main paper, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash. In the detailed prompt, the models are explicitly provided with the full set of evaluation rubric designed or verified by expert. To minimize differences from the generic prompt and show the effect of rubric exposure, we construct the detailed prompt by appending the phrase You will be evaluated based on the following rubric: followed by the complete set of evaluation rubrics designed or verified by domain experts. The prompt is shown in Tab. 59 and corresponding results are presented in Tab. 60. Table 60: The performance of generic prompt and detailed prompt on T2LegalSFG scaled to 0-100. Prompt Generic Detailed GPT-4o Accuracy F1 score Accuracy Gemini-2.0-Flash F1 score 4.3 29.7 6.2 32.5 5.4 25. 7.9 28.6 The results demonstrate that detailed prompts lead to substantial improvements in performance. Specifically, GPT-4o achieves an increase in accuracy from 4.3 to 29.7 and in F1 score from 6.2 to 32.5. Similarly, Gemini-2.0-Flash shows an improvement in accuracy from 5.4 to 25.0 and in F1 score from 7.9 to 28.6. These findings indicate that providing models with the detailed evaluation rubric significantly enhances their ability to align with task-specific requirements and produce more accurate outputs. However, despite these improvements, the performance remains relatively low, with F1 scores still below 33 and accuracy below 30 for both models, suggesting that the task continues to pose significant challenges for current state-of-the-art models even when providing the ground-truth evaluation checklist. I.2 Limitations of LLMs in Generating High-Quality Evaluation Rubric We evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality fine-grained evaluation checklists on Tasks T1LegalMDS, T6HealthCNG, and T7ChemMDG. Specifically, we use GPT-4o (2024-11-20) with the prompt provided in Tab. 61 to produce detailed fine-grained checklists for each task. Example prompt for T1LegalMDS is shown in Tab. 62. For tasks T1LegalMDS, T6HealthCNG, and T7ChemMDG, our expert-guided evaluation checklists contained 26, 29, and 6 items, respectively, while model-generated checklists included 20, 22, and 7 items for T1LegalMDS, T6HealthCNG, and T7ChemMDG. We conducted manual evaluation of the model-generated checklist items and identified several issues: Table 61: Prompt used to guide LLMs in generating fine-grained evaluation checklists. You are an expert in designing fine-grained evaluation checklists for complex tasks. Your goal is to create detailed and domain-specific evaluation checklist for the given task. The checklist must cover all essential aspects of the task, ensuring comprehensive and precise evaluation. This is the task description: <system prompt for getting model output> Table 62: Prompt used to guide LLMs in generating fine-grained evaluation checklists for T1LegalMDS. You are an expert in designing fine-grained evaluation checklists for complex tasks. Your goal is to create detailed and domain-specific evaluation checklist for the given task. The checklist must cover all essential aspects of the task, ensuring comprehensive and precise evaluation. This is the task description: Generate clear and legally precise summary of multiple-document legal case. Focus on capturing key facts, procedural history, and significant rulings in way that is easy to understand. Provide enough detail to convey the cases development and outcome without being excessively long or overly detailed. These are the case documents: [User will provide]. 1. Subjectivity in checklist items: The model occasionally produced subjective items, where different annotators might interpret the scoring criteria inconsistently (e.g., GPT-4o generated checklist item assessing neutrality which evaluates whether the summary is free from bias or subjective interpretation for T1LegalMDS. However, this criterion is itself subjective and may be interpreted differently by different annotators); 2. Omission of expert-guided checklist items: Important checklist items created by human experts were missing (e.g., missing checklist items such as conjugate acid and conjugate base in T7ChemMDG); 3. Generation of unsuitable or redundant items: The model generated unsuitable or redundant items (e.g., GPT-4o generated checklist item assessing peer review which evaluates whether the summary has been reviewed by legal expert or peer for accuracy and clarity for T1LegalMDS); 4. Lack of granularity: Some items lacked sufficient granularity (e.g., GPT-4o generated checklist item assessing assessment accuracy, where it evaluates whether the clinical assessment reflects the patients current condition based on the conversation. This checklist item is not fine-grained enough because it conflates multiple aspectssuch as the correctness of symptom interpretation, appropriateness of diagnostic reasoning, and alignment with clinical guidelinesinto single criterion, making it difficult to assess specific strengths or weaknesses in the models output.); 5. Misunderstandings of what should be covered in specific parts: The model misunderstood the structure of domain-specific sections, such as mistakenly putting the chief complaint in the History of Present Illness in T6HealthCNG. The distribution of problematic items is illustrated in Tab. 63. In conclusion, LLM-generated fine-grained checklist-based evaluation rubric often exhibit significant limitations, including subjectivity in item creation, missing critical expert-designed checklist items, generation of unsuitable or overly broad items, and lack of contextual understanding of what information item need to be covered in each part. Overall, GPT-4o does not have the capability to generate rigorous and complete evaluation checklists like human experts. These findings highlight the need for careful human oversight and domain expertise in designing reliable evaluation rubric. I.3 Limitation While our benchmark offers comprehensive foundation for evaluating LLMs on expert-level tasks, several limitations merit consideration. First, although LLM-based evaluation methods have shown 74 Table 63: Assessment of evaluation checklist items generated by GPT-4o. #Item (Human) indicates the number of evaluation checklist items created by humans for the corresponding task. #Item (LLM) refers to the number of evaluation checklist items generated by GPT-4o. #Subjective denotes the number of model-generated checklist items that are considered subjective. #Unsuitable/Redundant represents the number of model-generated checklist items deemed unsuitable or redundant. #Coarsegrained indicates the number of model-generated checklist items that are not fine-grained enough. #Coarse-grained #Unsuitable/Redundant #Item (Human) #Item (LLM) #Subjective Task T1LegalMDS T6HealthCNG T7ChemMDG 26 29 6 20 22 7 6 7 5 1 2 3 3 1 promising alignment with expert judgments, they can still yield erroneous or inconsistent assessments, especially in complex or ambiguous cases. Second, our benchmark is limited to English-language tasks, and does not yet address the needs of multilingual expert applications. Third, our analysis focuses on the off-the-shelf performance of LLMs without exploring complex prompting strategies, tool use, or agentic workflows that are increasingly common in applied research. Fourth, while we provide fine-grained evaluation criteria tailored to expert domains, this paper does not focus on proposing concrete strategies for model improvements. Finally, although our dataset spans 11 expert-level tasks across 9 domains, it captures only small fraction of the thousands of real-world expert applications. We plan to expand the benchmark with additional tasks and targeted evaluation metrics to further enhance its coverage and utility. I.4 Broader Impacts As LLMs grow increasingly capable, their use is rapidly expanding beyond general-purpose tasks to high-stakes, expert-level domains such as law, medicine, and education. This shift presents both tremendous opportunities and serious challenges. On one hand, LLMs hold the potential to democratize access to expert services, reduce cognitive burdens, and improve efficiency in professional settings. On the other hand, inaccurate or hallucinated outputs in such contexts can lead to harmful consequenceslegal misjudgments, medical errors, or the spread of educational misinformation. Our work contributes to the responsible scaling of LLMs into expert domains by introducing benchmark that rigorously evaluates model performance on realistic, end-to-end expert tasks across multiple disciplines. By incorporating expert-written references and task-specific evaluation rubric, we aim to facilitate grounded, transparent, and fine-grained assessments of model capabilities. The EXPERTLONGBENCH, together with CLEAR, better aligns with the needs and judgments of experts and professionals, providing stronger foundation for evaluating LLM progress. We hope this work will guide future research and deployment practices, encouraging the AI community to prioritize rigorous evaluation when applying LLMs in expert-level scenarios.
