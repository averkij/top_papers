            "content": "Video Language Models (VideoLMs) represent major advancement in multi-modal AI [15], enhancing Vision Language Models (VLMs) with temporal reasoning that allows them to understand how visual narratives, objects, actions, and relationships evolve across video sequences. This enables wide range of downstream applications, from more natural human-computer interaction [6, 7] through video question-answering to robotics [8, 9], where agents must understand sequential actions [10, 11]. Their importance extends beyond this technical capability: they represent fundamental step toward AI systems that perceive and reason about the world more like humans do, processing information not as disconnected snapshots but as continuous, meaningful experiences. As video continues to dominate digital content, with platforms generating petabytes of video daily, models that can watch and understand video at scale [1214] become essential for the next generation of AI applications. VideoLMs have maximum context window limiting the amount of information that can be provided as input. This is not only training artifact, but also related to hardware constraints, as larger context windows require linearly more memory and quadratic compute [15]. To fit in the context window, existing VideoLMs select subset of video frames as keyframes either through some handcrafted heuristics (e.g., uniform temporal [16]) or learned methods (e.g., flexible frame selection [17]). In this setup, proprietary models with extended context lengths of up to 1 million tokens can take as input one hour of video at 1 FPS [16]. Open-source models [4] have much smaller budget and generally sample fixed number of frames (e.g., 64) regardless of video length. This is rather counterintuitive, as the information content naturally scales with video duration. there is generally high redundancy between consecutive frames (even when downsampled to 1 FPS); therefore, using the same token budget for each keyframe is suboptimal. Furthermore, treating each keyframe as full image also significantly increases the prefill time [18], delaying the timeto-first token (TTFT) of the VideoLM. Low TTFT is critical for user experience and essential for robotics applications requiring real-time responsiveness. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video compression, decades-old field that addresses redundancy and sparsity in these streams [19, 20]. The main idea of video codecs is to encode what moves between frames as motion vectors and what changes between two frames as residuals, thus preserving the sparsity of the original stream. Their native structure minimizes redundancy by picking keyframes either at fixed interval or when large differences are detected. In typical streaming setup, these codecs provide keyframes every 510 seconds, encoding only the changes for all other frames. We propose to directly encode the motion vectors and residuals (i.e., codec primitives), by learning to represent them as aligned tokens compatible with image features, then concatenating them alongside keyframe image tokens during inference. An overview of our approach is shown in Fig. 1. This provides two major advantages: first, we avoid the costly full image encoding for most of the frames, and second, we can use much fewer tokens given the sparse nature of these primitives, thus reducing TTFT by significant margin. Optionally, the motion vectors and residuals of several subsequent frames can be grouped together to strike trade-off between fine-grained representation and total number of tokens. Note that this methodology is valuable beyond VideoLMs and can be used for other tasks such as video retrieval or action recognition. Moreover, any keyframe sampling approach fundamentally limits VideoLMs understanding by providing only sparse temporal coverage: this can miss both macro-level events crucial for high-level comprehension and micro-level details necessary for recognizing fine-grained actions. In addition, To this end, we propose to use transformer-based encoders to aggregate the information of all motion vectors and residuals from given frame. These encoders are first pre-trained to adapt them to the space of the image encoder and then, integrated with state-of-the-art open-source Vide2 oLM for end-to-end finetuning. The final model matches the performance of top VideoLMs and even surpasses them on several benchmarks despite using substantially fewer tokens. We extensively validate our approach across 14 benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains across general video QA, temporal understanding, long-form reasoning, and spatial scene understanding tasks. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose novel way to encode videos for VideoLMs by leveraging the standardized compressed representation of video codecs. Codec primitives allows us to skip redundant RGB information, reducing the TTFT by up to 86% and token usage by up to 93%. We introduce two lightweight architectures for encoding codec primitives, achieving substantially higher compression rates / lower token counts than traditional image-based encoders. We propose pre-training strategy for codecprimitive encoders that aligns their representation space with that of image encoders, enabling faster training and quicker convergence when integrated with the VideoLM."

            "content": "Recent advances Video Language Models. Language Models in Multimodal (MLLMs) [2132] have extended image-based architectures into the video domain, giving rise to VideoLMs capable of temporal reasoning over dynamic visual content. MLLMs typically comprise vision encoder (e.g., CLIP [33] or SigLIP [34]), modality alignment mechanism also known as adapter (e.g., linear projection, QFormer [35, 36], or gated cross-attention [37]), and an LLM backbone (e.g., LLaMA [38], Vicuna [39], or Qwen [14, 40, 41]) for mulEarly VideoLMs such as timodal decoding. Video-LLaMA [42] and VideoChat2 [1] relied on sparsely sampled keyframes and lightweight adapters, but were limited by short context and redundant tokenization. Subsequent models, including Video-LLaMA3 [5], improve efficiency through extended context windows and adaptive token compression, while others [4346] pool or merge tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions to fit longer clips within fixed budgets. Models such as TimeChat [47] and LLaVA-Video [4] further enhance temporal reasoning: TimeChat integrates timestamp-aware encoding with sliding video Q-Former for precise event localization, while LLaVA-Video leverages large-scale instruction tuning and optimized frame sampling for improved coherence. Closed-source systems like Gemini [13, 16, 48], GPT [12, 48] and Claude [49] demonstrate impressive fine-grained and long-context understanding but depend on proprietary data and undisclosed architectures. Despite these advances, open-source VideoLMs still process videos as dense RGB frame collections, overlooking the structured redundancy inherent in standard video codecs. Leveraging codec primitives like motion vectors and residuals, our approach directly encodes temporal dynamics, supporting efficient long-context understanding while retaining fine-grained detail. Token Compression. Compression techniques reduce the number of visual tokens fed into VideoLMs by removing redundancy while preserving semantic fidelity. Existing methods can be grouped into heuristic and learnable approaches. Heuristic methods apply rule-based feature reduction such as uniform downsampling [50], spatial or temporal pooling [4, 51, 52], or similarityguided merging [5355]. Learnable compression modules, including Q-Former [40, 56, 57], Perceiver Resampler [58], and memory-based mechanisms such as MovieChat [59, 60] and ChatUniVi [54], generate compact latent representations of video frames before integrating them to the LLM. Attention-based token compression methods [6164] leverage the inherent sparsity of visual feature attention [65] to guide token pruning. FrameFusion [62] removes visually redundant tokens, while PyramidDrop [63] and SparseVLM [64] dynamically modulate pruning ratios across model layers. FastV [61] first observed that visual tokens receive negligible attention after early layers and showed that pruning up to 50% of them preserves performance. On the other hand, 3 temporal pooling approaches [43, 51, 66, 67] exploit inter-frame redundancy by downsampling at the frame level. DyCoke [68] performs temporal pruning within grouped frames, and LLaVAScissor [69] leverages semantic connected components for spatio-temporal compression, achieving strong results particularly at low token retention ratios (See Supp. Sec for comparative study). More adaptive approaches such as AdaReTake [70] and FlexSelect [71] dynamically allocate compression budgets across layers or leverage cross-modal attention to filter tokens without retraining. However, these methods rely on dense RGB frame encodings and neglect intrinsic temporal redundancy. In contrast, our native codec representation inherently encodes only meaningful temporal changes rather than removing information post hoc. There Compressed Video Representation. has been growing interest in exploiting motion vectors and residuals directly from compressed video streams for visual understanding, particularly in action recognition, thus bypassing the costly full-frame processing. Early works such as CoViAR [72] pioneered this direction by training separate 2D CNNs on Iand P-frames and averaging their predictions, while TEAM-Net [73] introduced cross-modality interaction modules to better fuse compressed signals. However, these methods ignore inter-modal dependencies and temporal ordering, leading to high computational overheads and the need for multi-crop or multiclip inference. Later, CV-C3D [74] and DMCNet [75] extended compressed-domain learning to 3D CNNs and optical-flow-guided distillation, respectively, achieving improved accuracy at the cost of higher inference latency. Distillation-based approaches [76, 77] further align compresseddomain models with raw-domain teachers, but still require access to decoded RGB frames during training, reducing efficiency gains. Recent transformer-based models such as MMViT [78] attempt to leverage self-attention across codec primitives but incur significant inference costs. CompressedVideoMAE [79], introduces masked autoencoding pre-training in the compressed domain, demonstrating that spatial-temporal representations can be effectively learned using only motion vectors and residuals, achieving performance comparable to raw-video pretraining with far less compute. More recently, codec-based representations have been explored in VideoLMs. Video-LaVIT [80] discretizes motion vectors into language-like tokens, and EMA [81] discards residuals and aggregates I-frames and motion vectors within each GOP into fixed-length summary representation, similar to Video-VAE [82]. In contrast, CoPE-VideoLM treats both motion vectors and residuals as structured and unified codecnative representation and constructs variablelength, temporally ordered token sequence that adapts to content dynamics. By preserving finegrained motion and appearance signals instead of compressing them into fixed summaries or imagelike proxies, our method supports efficient and temporally consistent modeling across broader video language understanding."

            "content": "Modern video codecs such as MPEG-4, H.264, and HEVC [83, 84] achieve high compression ratios by exploiting temporal redundancy across consecutive frames. Let video be sequence of frames (𝐹 (1) , . . . , 𝐹 (𝑇 ) ). Each of these frames can be an I-frame (intra-coded), P-frame (predictive), or optionally B-frame (bi-directional predictive). Consecutive frames are organized in Group of Pictures (GOP) structure as illustrated in Fig. 2. I-frames. An I-frame, 𝐼 (𝑡) , is an RGB image encoded independently without the use of preceding or subsequent frames. It is used as reference point of the Group of Pictures and provides full visual representation. P-frame 𝑃 (𝑡) contains only the P-frames. changes from the previous frame, be it reference frame 𝐼 (𝑡1) or some other P-frame 𝑃 (𝑡1) . The difference is defined by two components: Motion vectors 𝜏(𝑡) , which describe block-wise displacements from the reference to the tar4 Figure 2 Overview of our pipeline. Given video in its raw codec representation, our framework leverages the GOP structure for efficient, codec-aware tokenization. I-frames are processed by standard frozen vision encoder (𝜙RGB) to produce dense RGB tokens. P-frames, however, bypass full RGB decoding. Their raw components, motion vectors and residuals, are instead fed into our lightweight Δ-Encoder (𝜙Δ) to generate small set of highly compact Δ-tokens. The final token stream, an interleaved sequence of I-frame tokens and Δ-tokens, is consumed by the LLM, enabling dense temporal coverage at fraction of the standard token count and runtime. get frame, resembling coarse optical flow. Residuals 𝛿(𝑡) , which capture block-wise pixel corrections that remain after motion compensation. The recurrence [72, 79] for reconstructing Pframe is: 𝑖 = ˆ𝐼 (𝑡1) ˆ𝐼 (𝑡) 𝑖𝜏(𝑡) 𝑖 + 𝛿(𝑡) 𝑖 , (1) where 𝑖 is the pixel coordinate index and ˆ𝐼 (𝑡1) = 𝐼 (𝑡1) 𝐹 (𝑡) is an I-frame . (2) Hence, P-frames contain only incremental temporal information, and are therefore smaller in file size than I-frames. B-frames. B-frame leverages both preceding and subsequent frames to encode its differences. While this bidirectional prediction achieves the highest compression efficiency, it increases decoding complexity: B-frames must wait for future I/P-frames, creating mismatch between decode and display order. Consequently, they are less suited for streaming or real-time use. We therefore focus on P-frames, which depend only on past references and align naturally with the causal processing required by VideoLMs. Group of Pictures (GOP). GOP is cycle structure that comprises one I-frame together with any mixture of Pand/or B-frames, e.g., 𝐼 𝐵 𝑃 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃 𝑒𝑡𝑐. The GOP structure and length control the tradeoffs between the compression efficiency, quality, and the capability for random access. Typical applications use varying configurations: all three frame types are used by the H.264 codec, while early MPEG-4 uses mainly the Iand the P-frames (see Supp. Sec for detailed explanation). Implication for VideoLMs. Despite this rich structure, current VideoLMs discard codec information and fully decode and tokenize dense RGB frames, ignoring the inherent sparsity of Pand Bframes. This results in unnecessary computation and inflated token counts."

            "content": "Our framework explicitly leverages the GOP structure and introduces codec-aware tokenization framework that seamlessly integrates with Vide5 oLMs. Instead of unnecessarily encoding each frame as RGB patches like prior work, we retain I-frames as full RGB tokens and encode P-frames into lightweight and compact Δ-tokens (delta for difference) obtained from motion vectors and residuals, thereby preserving temporal coverage without exceeding token budgets. An illustration of this process is presented in Fig. 2. Given video = (𝐹 (1) , . . . , 𝐹 (𝑇 ) ), each frame 𝐹 (𝑡) is represented as: 𝐹 (𝑡) = (cid:40)𝐼 (𝑡) , 𝑃 (𝑡) = (𝜏(𝑡) , 𝛿(𝑡) ), if 𝐹 (𝑡) is an I-frame, if 𝐹 (𝑡) is P-frame, (3) where 𝜏(𝑡) is set of block-wise motion vectors (usually one per up to 16 16 region), and 𝛿(𝑡) is set of block-wise residuals. For our downstream processing, we represent these as tensors: 𝜏(𝑡) ℤ𝐻𝑊 2 is the sparse tensor constructed from the block-wise motion vectors and 𝛿(𝑡) ℝ𝐻𝑊 𝐶 is the sparse tensor of residuals. I-frames 𝐼 (𝑡) are passed I-frame processing. through frozen vision encoder 𝜙RGB, producing 𝑀 dense tokens: 𝑋 (𝑡) 𝐼 = 𝜙RGB(𝐼 (𝑡) ) ℝ𝑀𝑑 . (4) P-frame processing. Each P-frame 𝑃 (𝑡) is mapped into much more compact representation consisting of 𝑁 𝑀 tokens by the Δ-Encoder 𝜙Δ: 𝑋 (𝑡) 𝑃 = 𝜙Δ (𝜏(𝑡) , 𝛿(𝑡) ) ℝ𝑁 𝑑 . (5) In the setup described so far, P-frame fusion. processing all frames at the native frame rate is mandatory as codec primitives are defined relative to previous frames and skipping frames invalidates these dependencies. For example, let us consider 30 FPS video with GOP size of 240 frames (8 seconds). Our method yields 𝑀 + 239𝑁 tokens per GOP, compared to 240𝑀 if all frames were encoded as RGB images. Fine-grained action recognition may require this exhaustive temporal coverage, but most video understanding tasks can often be done with sparser coverage. Rather than processing all frames at the native frame rate, we can fuse 𝑠 consecutive P-frames, encoding their combined changes relative to frame (𝑡𝑠) (rather than the immediately preceding frame). The maximum number of P-frames that can be fused is bounded by the GOP size. In the running example, using 𝑠 = 30 P-frames (effectively 1 FPS) for fusion reduces the token count to 𝑀 +7𝑁 𝑀 +239𝑁 per GOP, instead of 8𝑀 when encoding RGB frames at 1 FPS. This fusion offers codec-native way to trade temporal resolution for efficiency and can be tuned to match available compute and task requirements. For clarity, we treat the temporal index (𝑡) as already incorporating the P-frame fusion, so 𝐹 (𝑡) always depends on 𝐹 (𝑡1) , though (𝑡) may no longer correspond to the raw frame indices. Δ-Encoder. The Δ-Encoder 𝜙Δ  (Fig. 3)  is designed to process the motion vectors 𝜏(𝑡) and residuals 𝛿(𝑡) through two specialized branches. The motion vectors 𝜏(𝑡) are processed via multi-layer MLP to extract local features over grid of size 𝐻𝐺 𝑊𝐺 flattened as ℝ( 𝐻𝐺𝑊𝐺 ) 𝑑. These features are then compressed via motion transformer 𝜃motion with set of 𝐾𝜏 learnable query tokens that can attend to all 𝐻𝐺𝑊𝐺 input tokens and aggregate their information as: 𝜏(𝑡) tok = 𝜃motion(MLP(𝜏(𝑡) )) . (6) Only these 𝐾𝜏 compressed motion tokens 𝜏(𝑡) ℝ𝐾𝜏 𝑑 are used in the VideoLM. tok frame 𝛿(𝑡) is embedded by The residual lightweight ResNet-18 [85] module to extract local features over the same grid size 𝐻𝐺 𝑊𝐺. Similarly to above, residual transformer 𝜃residual aggregates and compresses the raw features to set of 𝐾𝛿 compressed residual tokens 𝛿(𝑡) tok ℝ𝐾𝛿 𝑑 as: 𝛿(𝑡) tok = 𝜃residual(ResNet(𝛿(𝑡) )) . (7) In practice, we set Interleaved token stream. 𝐾𝜏 = 𝐾𝛿 = 4 and thus, 𝑁 = 8 (see Supp. for an ablation study). The final visual sequence input to the LLM is an ordered concatenation of I-frame and P-frame tokens: 6 𝑋 = (cid:2) 𝑥 (1) , 𝑥 (2) , . . . , 𝑥 (𝑇 ) (cid:3) , where 𝑥 (𝑡) = (cid:40)𝑋 (𝑡) , 𝐼 𝑋 (𝑡) 𝑃 , if 𝐹 (𝑡) if 𝐹 (𝑡) is an I-frame is P-frame . (8) and 𝑋 (𝑡) The LLM can consume 𝑋 (𝑡) 𝑃 alongside tex𝐼 tual instructions, without any architectural modifications. This approach reduces the redundant data considerably while preserving accurate temporal coverage and enables smooth scalability to long videos by adjusting the I-frame density, Pframe grouping, and token allocation. Figure 3 Δ-encoder processes motion vectors and residuals through two lightweight branches designed to extract and compress codec-domain information. The resulting motion and residual tokens are concatenated to form the Δ-tokens used for P-frames, providing an efficient representation, which is projected to the RGB token space during pre-training."

Then, this encoder is integrated into VideoLM and the whole pipeline is fine-tuned end-to-end. Δ-encoder pre-training. The primary difficulty lies in ensuring that the Δ-tokens 𝑋 (𝑡) 𝑃 are aligned with the image tokens 𝑋 (𝑡) . To achieve this, we 𝐼 pre-train the Δ-Encoder as modality adapter that enables codec-derived primitives (𝜏(𝑡) , 𝛿(𝑡) ) to be compatible with the embedding space defined by vision encoder. By aligning the Δ-tokens with this space, P-frames can then be compactly represented and replace standard RGB tokens within VideoLM. For pre-training, two additional modules are used on top of the outputs of the Δ-encoder. First, reference transformer 𝜃ref uses the image tokens from 𝐼 (𝑡1) and the compressed motion vector tokens 𝜏(𝑡) , and its aim is to understand how the intok formation moved in the image and how it modified the original tokens. This is akin to the warping in Eq. 1. Second, warped transformer 𝜃warped takes these enriched tokens and the residual tokens 𝛿(𝑡) in order to add the residual information emb as in Eq. 1.

(12) Unlike global contrastive losses, this fine-grained objective enforces spatially consistent alignment across patches. As result, the Δ-Encoder is encouraged to produce representations that are more closely aligned with the RGB token space, aiming to improve the integration of Iand Pframes during downstream VideoLM training (see Supp. Sec. G.2 to understand the effect of the pretraining phase). Integration into VideoLMs. After pre-training, we integrate the Δ-encoder 𝜙Δ into the VideoLM pipeline for full fine-tuning. We interleave the tokens coming from and frames as described in Eq. 8. Note that, the referenceconditioned branches (Reference / Warped) from 7 the Δ-encoder pre-training stage are not used at this stage, so no RGB reference frames are processed for the P-frames when training the language model. This yields substantial compute and memory reduction, as shown in Sec. 4.4. The LLM architecture and training objective remain unchanged (standard instruction tuning next-token prediction loss)."

Most open-source VideoLMs with 32K token window sample 64 frames per video, regardless of length [4, 102]. As result, unlike proprietary models, they cannot process videos at 1 FPS for videos longer than 64 seconds. Our framework, however, enables 1 FPS sampling (counting both Iand Pframes) for longer videos, by adjusting the number of keyframes per GOP. This allows the token budget to better scale with video duration, matching the natural growth of information content. In our experiments, for fair comparison, we sample frames at 1 FPS up to 64 GOPs unless otherwise specified. For videos longer than 64 GOPs (512s), we first perform uniform GOP sampling, and then encode only the I-/P-frames that are part of these sampled GOPs."

Our method only adds low number of Δ-tokens compared to its associated baseline and these help close the gap compared to the next baseline that is using significantly larger number of tokens.

B). General Video QA. As shown in Tab. 2, despite being trained on smaller corpus than most competing models, our codec-aware formulation achieves competitive or superior results across all major benchmarks. By leveraging motion vectors and residuals directly from the compressed stream, CoPE-VideoLM encodes substantially more frames within the same token budget, enhancing temporal coverage without sacrificing spatial fidelity. On PerceptionTest and ActivityNet-QA, our model yields the highest accuracy among all open-source models, indicating improved motion and appearance reasoning due to the Δ-encoders temporally grounded representation.

Tab. 3 evaluates benchmarks specifically designed to probe temporal understanding.

CoPE-VideoLM achieves the best results among open-source models on Video-TT [97], Video-MMMU [98], and LVBench [96], while remaining competitive on LongVideoBench [95]. By compressing P-frames into compact Δ-tokens, our framework processes substantially more temporal content within the same token budget, directly benefiting long-form comprehension and instruction-following tasks.

Through extensive experiments on several benchmarks, we have demonstrated that codec-aware tokenization offers compelling alternative to traditional keyframe sampling for VideoLMs. By leveraging the information natively encoded by video compression algorithms (i.e., motion vectors and residuals), we achieve substantial efficiency gains while maintaining competitive performance. Notably, our approach reduces timeto-first-token by up to 86% (to as low as 0.33s), which is essential for real-time applications. As models scale towards larger context windows, our approach becomes increasingly valuable, enabling richer temporal representations with much lower computational overhead than traditional sparse keyframe sampling.

We attribute this primarily to the difference in training data scale and composition rather than to the codec-aware formulation itself. Unlike LLaVA-Video, which trains on 1.61M video samples and an additional vision-totext alignment stage with 1.1M image samples, our model is trained solely on 1.39M instructiontuning samples from LLaVA-Video-178K [4] and three QA datasets (NextQA, ActNet-QA, and PerceptionTest).

Both datasets require associating multi-view observations with 3D spatial structure, making them natural testbed for assessing whether compressed-domain video cues can support geometry-aware reasoning. Training. We follow the same training pipeline used in our video-language experiments. However, since these videos are comparatively shorter in duration ( 15s total), we re-encode them with GOP size of 120 at 30 FPS with accumulation size 𝑠 = 10. This leads to around 3-4 GOPs per video. Following standard practice in 3D LMMs, we finetune our base model on ScanQA and SQA3D training split, without any datasetspecific heuristics or architectural modifications. We train and evaluate with 6 keyframes + 6 Pframes per GOP to align better with 32-RGB frame setting of the other models. Results. We report the results in Tab. B.1.

We show results for our method in zero-shot setup where it performs comparable to state-of-the-art VideoLMs despite using only 25% of tokens. We further show results after fine-tuning where the performance increases significantly, even outperforming significant number of 3D VLMs which employ additional inputs (e.g., point-clouds, camera poses). require the costly image embedding step for every frame, which dominates the prefill latency. In contrast, CoPE-VideoLM avoids full image encoding for most frames entirely by leveraging codec-level sparsity, and token pruning methods could be applied as an additional compression mechanism on top of ours. Tab. C.1 compares CoPE-VideoLM against these methods at similar token budgets. Our approach consistently outperforms all token compression baselines across ActNet-QA [89], NextQA [88], and VideoMME [90], while additionally being 7 faster in time-to-first-token, as shown in Tab. 5), since the Δ-encoder bypasses the vision encoder entirely for P-frames. These results confirm that operating in the compressed domain provides fundamentally more efficient starting point than post-hoc pruning of dense RGB tokens.

Each patch is flattened into vector of dimension 1622, and lightweight two-layer MLP with shared weights is applied independently to each patch, producing per-block embeddings with the same feature dimension as the vision encoder (𝑑 = 1152). To aggregate these features, we employ transformer equipped with 𝐾𝜏 learnable query tokens. These tokens are concatenated with the motion features along the sequence length dimension at the input of the transformer and then processed together using regular multi-headed attention layers. The transformer contains 4 layers with hidden dimension 𝑑, uses 9 attention heads, and adopts PreNorm residual blocks throughout. Residual Branch.

Fewer tokens encourage more aggressively com14 Figure 5 Codec primer. We visualize from left to right: the previous frame, the motion vectors and residuals between previous and current frame, the intermediate reconstruction after motion compensation, and the final result after adding the residuals. pressed representation, whereas larger token budgets allow the Δ-Encoder to retain finer motion and appearance cues from the codec primitives. Tab. G.1 reports the effect of varying this value while keeping all other model and sampling configurations fixed. We observe consistent trend across both benchmarks. Moving from 2 to 4 Δ-tokens yields noticeable improvement, as the model benefits from an expanded latent space that can more faithfully capture motion and residual structure. Increasing to 8 Δ-tokens further improves performance, reaching the best overall results. Beyond this point, however, allocating more capacity produces diminishing returns: both NextQA and PerceptionTest remain nearly unchanged when increasing to 16 tokens. This indicates that the codec primitives contain limited amount of signal per fused Pframe, and that 8 tokens are sufficient to encode the relevant temporal variations. For this reason, we adopt 8 Δ-tokens per P-frame as the default configuration throughout, balancing accuracy and token efficiency. G.2 Two-Stage Training We ablate the contribution of each component in our two-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training the Δ-Encoder to align codec primitives with the RGB embedding space, and (ii) end-to-end finetuning of the full VideoLM. The results are shown in Tab. G.2. Finetuning the VideoLM without any Δ-encoder pre-training yields reasonable performance, though noticeably worse than the full two-stage approach In this one-stage setting, the model must simultaneously learn motionresidual interpretation, feature alignment, and multimodal reasoning, which slows convergence and leads Δ-tokens per P-Frame PerceptionTest NextQA 1 Keyframe per GOP 2 4 8 16 63.26 65.68 67.33 67.69 +2.42 +1.65 +0.36 75.04 76.08 77.37 77.89 +1.04 +1.29 +0.52 Table G.1 Number of Δ-tokens per P-frame. We train several versions of our model with different number of Δ-tokens per P-frame. Performance significantly increases when going from aggressive compression (2 or 4 tokens) up to 8, which is the value we used for the results in the main paper. Going to 16 further improves performance, but the margin is much smaller and does not justify the significant increase in total number of tokens. to weaker temporal understanding, particularly on PerceptionTest. The best results are achieved when both stages are used. Pre-training ensures that Δ-tokens inhabit well-structured embedding space, while finetuning teaches the LLM how to infuse the Iand P-frame tokens together. This combination consistently provides the strongest performance across both datasets. While twostage training is clearly advantageous in our data regime, we note that the benefit may diminish when scaling to datasets exceeding 3M training samples. In such high-data settings, one-stage training may gradually compensate for the missing pre-training at the cost of more compute. G.3 Are Δ-tokens used by the VideoLM? natural question is whether the VideoLM actually uses the Δ-tokens during inference, rather than ignoring them and relying solely on sparse keyframes. To probe this, we conduct an ablation in an identical sampling regime, 1 keyframe + 7 P-frames per GOP and simply zero out all P-frame 15 Pre-train Δ-Encoder Finetune LLM PerceptionTest NextQA 1 Keyframe per GOP - 63.45 67.33 74.56 77.37 Table G.2 Two-stage training.

This yields significantly lower performance than the two stage setup proposed in the main paper: Stage 1 Pre-train the Δ-encoder and Stage 2 Finetune pre-trained Δ-encoder & pretrained LLM together. Δ-tokens at inference time. This preserves the temporal structure of the input while removing all motion and residual information contributed by the Δ-encoder, isolating their functional role. As shown in Tab. G.3, performance drops substantially when Δ-tokens are removed, confirming that the VideoLM meaningfully leverages compresseddomain temporal cues for reasoning. These results demonstrate that the model is not merely interpolating between sparse I-frames but actively uses Δ-tokens to track motion, maintain temporal grounding, and refine fine-grained visual details. G.4 Benefits of Codec Primitives To isolate the benefit of our codec-aware training from the effect of Δ-tokens themselves, we conduct controlled experiment where all frames are encoded identically.

We compare our method with version where we set all Δ-tokens to zero, effectively not providing any useful information to the VideoLM. Zeroing out P-frame Δ-tokens leads to clear performance degradation, confirming that the VideoLM attends to and utilizes the information of these tokens. outperforms LLaVA-Video by +5.2%, indicating that the codec-aware training procedure itself improves temporal reasoning beyond what Δ-tokens alone contribute. Furthermore, replacing half of the I-frames with P-frames yields comparable accuracy at nearly half the token cost, which confirms Δ-tokens serve as an efficient substitute for full RGB tokens without sacrificing understanding.

We compare LLaVA-Video and our model under identical input (8 I-frames) and under mixed configuration (4 I-frames + 4 P-frames). Our model achieves higher accuracy at equal token cost, and retains this gain when substituting half the I-frames with lightweight Δ-tokens at roughly half the tokens. G.5 Scaling to Higher Frame Rates key advantage of our tokenization is that Pframes are represented with only 𝑁=8 Δ-tokens, compared to 𝑀=210 tokens for each I-frame, enabling higher effective frame rates under constrained token budget. To study this trade-off, we increase the effective FPS from 1 to 3 by reducing the P-frame fusion window 𝑠 from 30 to 10 frames, thereby encoding finer-grained temporal changes at increasing token cost. We evaluate on TempCompass [91] and MVBench [94], as both benchmarks are sensitive to temporal coverage. Increasing the frame rate leads to consistent gains on TempCompass (Tab. G.5). This illustrates the benefit of denser temporal signals for fine-grained temporal reasoning. MVBench also improves with higher FPS, though the gains are more moderate. Importantly, these improvements show that our framework enables practical and flexible trade-off between temporal resolution and token efficiency that would be prohibitive with RGB representations. 16 FPS Fusion 𝑠 P-frames / GOP Num.

            "content": "To assess the representational quality of our compressed-domain features, we evaluate nextframe retrieval at 1 FPS on PerceptionTest [87]. Formally, the task can be defined as: given query frame 𝐼 (𝑡1) at time 𝑡 1, the task is to identify its true successor frame 𝐼 (𝑡) at time 𝑡 from database containing all frames from the same video (except itself 𝐼 (𝑡1) ). As baseline, SigLIP [34] processes the raw RGB frame 𝐼 (𝑡1) , whereas our model uses 𝐼 (𝑡1) together with the current motion vectors 𝜏(𝑡) and residuals 𝛿(𝑡) to produce 𝑁=8 Δ-tokens per P-frame via the Δ-Encoder and lightweight transformer branches used during pre-training. For this experiment, we use the intermediate checkpoint after pre-training, as it is compatible with the reference and warped transformers that are used to transform the features of the previous frame. The results are shown in Tab. G.6. Our method outperforms the baseline by large margin across the board. When retrieving single frame, the relatively low absolute performance is expected, as subsequent frames are heavily similar even at 1 FPS, but our method successfully leverages the codec primitives to significantly improve the performance. Furthermore, our method achieves almost perfect performance at 5 frames, with its very high recall of 94.86%. These strong improvements over SigLIP confirm that the Δ-Encoder preserves semantically meaningful motion and appearance cues that are critical for retrieval. This experiment also highlights that codec primitives contain rich temporal information that is often lost when sampling sparse keyframes. @1 FPS"

The baseline uses the SigLIP embedding of the current frame, while we use the current frame along with the motion vectors and residuals to next frame, as processed by our Δ-encoder and pre-training transformers.
