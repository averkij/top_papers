As a result, recent legislation\nmandates the identification and notification of the synthetic nature\nof such digital content [38]. By virtue of all these needs, correctly\nattributing synthetic content has become a social demand, and a\ntop scientific priority (i.e., is this image authentic or synthetic?).",
            "content": "The field of synthetic image detection is in continuous race with the field of synthetic image generation. The detection field tries to prevent the race by developing universal detectors [8, 32], but the generalization capacity of these solutions is not entirely known. Meanwhile, new generative models join the race every month (if not every day), begging for the question, where is this going? This work uncovers where current Synthetic Image Detection (SID) is, and where it seems to be headed to. To do so, it first analyzes the impact of several training conditions on model generalization, producing recipe for building robust detectors. Those guidelines are then used to train baseline for the study of generalization across source variations (who created the data), model variation (which model was used) and model age (when was the model released). The same experimental setup is used to conduct an updated benchmark of state-of-the-art detector models, using synthetic data produced by the latest generators. Findings indicate current detectors are insufficient for synthetic content detection, especially when used alone. Suggestions include the use of detector ensembles, as well as the training of generatorspecific detectors. This last option appears as the most reliable solution and is shown to generalize to different data sources. Finally, the ethical considerations of this line of work are discussed, including when and how should detectors be publicly released, considering how these may be used to train generators which are harder to identify. To complete the work contributions we release two novel datasets, the software library used for experimentation and the weights of the best detector trained."

This\nlimits the consistency and relevance of results in a fast-moving\nfield like the one of generative AI, where models are continuously\nand quickly improved and replaced. The main body of previous\nwork on synthetic image detectors was conducted on Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) generators (now only used because of\ntheir relative speed), as well as early versions of diffusion-based\nmodels [9, 17, 27, 32, 42, 43, 47, 48]. A few recent works target data\nproduced by some of the latest diffusion models, which are the ones\ncurrently compromising the human ability to discriminate between\nreal and fake [7, 8, 10, 33].",
            "content": "Generalization is key in the SID field, as failing to successfully detect samples produced by alternative generative models limits the applicability of any proposed solution. To study generalization, common practice in the field is to train models using data produced by one model, while evaluating performance on data produced by other models [79, 17, 32, 33, 47, 48]. However, none of these studies considers the temporal natural of generative models nor what this may tell us about the detection performance on models to be released in the future. Remarkably, this is the case that matters the most for the practical use of synthetic image detectors. While the field is missing an exhaustive and updated study on the generalization of SID, few sources of bias have been considered before. Particularly, the effect of image format and resolution has been studied in the past. In [9], authors highlight the impact of the resizing operation, which is common in deep learning architectures, and used to adapt any image to the desired network input resolution. This transformation could remove the high-frequency artifacts created by the generative models, hindering the detection process. GenImage [48] studies the image content generalization, that is, how detector performs on domains outside the training data, such as art and face images. They show great generalization capability for these two cases, with 95% and 99.9% accuracy scores respectively. Yet, the generalization of image content has not been thoroughly explored. This is particularly important given that SID models, which often rely on common training datasets like LSUN [45] and ProGAN [22], suffer from limited class representation. The study presented in [17] highlights biases associated with JPEG compression and image size, demonstrating that these biases are prevalent in many training datasets. Notably, they reveal significant disparity in image formats between authentic and synthetic Bernabeu-Perez, Lopez-Cuena and Garcia-Gasulla several reasons. Firstly, not all parts of an image may be artificial, as they can be partially edited or altered through methods like inpainting. Secondly, its nature may be better identified in specific portions of the image as some regions might contain more telltale signs of manipulation than others. Finally, processing entire high-resolution images can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, most detectors are trained on image patches. This introduces new variables in the detection process: the number of patches and their selection strategy, as well as the criterion to convert single-patch predictions to whole image ones. To determine our patch selection strategy, we conduct early experiments and find that patches which exhibit the highest contrast in their grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) produce slightly more performant models. Due to the size of our input images, we consider maximum of five 224 224 patches. The predictions of these individual patches can then be aggregated according to the use case requirements (e.g., maximizing the detection of false positives, or prioritizing false negatives instead). In particular, we select voting mechanism and set minimum amount of patches for an image to be considered synthetic. We will study the effect of the value of this threshold in 5.2."

Another dataset, the diffusiondb [40], was created using models of the 1.x Stable Diffusion series, which were released in 2022. In this dataset, we filter samples making sure that \"photo\" appears in the prompt. Images from this dataset are of lower quality and visual detail than those of its successor SDXL [3], which was released in 2023. The associated dataset, SDXL [13] contains 5,435 images in the \"realistic\" subset. Beyond DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, the third main provider of synthetic images is Midjourney. Its early iterations, the V1 and V2 models, date from early 2022, and were used to populate the mj-tti [37] dataset, which contains 4,530 images. Collage images and mosaics made of synthetic images were removed from this dataset. Later models, the V5 and V6 models from 2023 compose our last training dataset, mj-images [15], with 1,226 images. This dataset also had to be deduplicated. All these synthetic models will be used for training and validation in 4. In 4, during the training stages of this work, COCO and diffusiondb datasets are undersampled to include maximum of 5,435 samples. Existing train, validation and test partitions are respected.

Furthermore, the authors demonstrate size bias affecting detector performance, with detectors generally performing better on natural images that differ significantly in size from the generated images used in training. This observation aligns with findings in [10], which demonstrate that dataset choice significantly impacts detection performance. The authors found that using the LSUN dataset for authentic samples, instead of COCO, led to considerable degradation in results. This was attributed to LSUNs lack of diversity and inherent biases. Meanwhile, relevant factors remain to be studied. This includes model family, model release date, and dataset source, among others. These are of special relevance for understanding generalization, and the practical future of the field."

The results from the single-class model evaluations, shown in Table 2, reveal discrepancy between performance in academic settings and practical applicability. While all models achieved high recall (over 97%) on their respective binary tasks, their performance degraded significantly when applied to other datasets. Additionally, results indicate that the family of generative models has weak effect on generalization capabilities. The discriminator trained on SDXL is below average when tested on SD1.X. Likewise, the model trained on MJ 1/2 discriminator is not particularly accurate on MJ 5/6. Although the MJ 5/6 discriminator performs well on MJ 1/2, it still generalizes better to other classes. The effect of image format is also inconclusive, with the model trained on MJ 1/2 generalizing poorly to SD1.X, both containing PNG images. On the other hand, the time of release of the generative model correlates well with generalized performance. The models trained on DALLE3 and MJ 5/6 strongly generalize to each other. While this may be influenced by shared dataset authorship, both models also generalize well to SDXL, demonstrating accurate performance on recent models regardless of their provenance. In fact, the three discriminators trained on models from 2023 are the top three models on average. That is, newer models are good at detecting new and old synthetic images. This could be caused by the quality and the lack of artifacts in the images generated by the latest models. In which case it would hold that images generated by older models are harder to identify than images from newer models. The bottom row of Table 2, shows this is the case, with detection accuracy on older datasets performing worse of all (SD1.X and MJ 1/2, from 2022)."

Our approach involves training six-class recognition models, which performed best in the previous experiments, using different data augmentation modalities in isolation, including various forms of blur (AdvancedBlur and GaussianBlur), brightness and gamma alterations (RandomBrightnessContrast and RandomGamma) and compression of images through the JPEG algorithm, from the Albumentations library [6]. These augmentation techniques were chosen to simulate the range of transformations that images might undergo in real-world conditions. In addition to the baseline with no alterations, five additional models are trained (one for each alteration), and five new test sets are created (also one per alteration).

Multi-class macro average recall is reported, where confusion between synthetic classes is considered an error, unlike in the previous section where we used binary metrics for comparison. The effectiveness of targeted data augmentation can be seen by comparing the first row of Table 4 with the values in bold. Specialized models demonstrate significant performance boost over the baseline across most alterations, with the exception of JPEG compression. This anomaly may be attributed to the inclusion of JPEG data in the baseline training set. Despite this apparent performance drop, training with compressed images remains relevant to prevent the recognition of JPEG-introduced patterns as class-specific artifacts, as both authentic and synthetic images may undergo this transformation in real-world scenarios. Among the various transformations, blur particularly GaussianBlur has the most pronounced impact on detector performance. Models not specifically trained on blur transformations experience substantial drop in recall, up to 30%, when faced with blurred images. In contrast, models trained on blur transformations exhibit remarkable consistency and competitive performance across all experiments. Based on the average performance metrics presented in the last column of Table 4, these blur-trained models emerge as the overall best performers among the alteration-based models. 4.3.1 SuSy - Our robust model.

In detail, we train six-class classifier, using the original splits defined in Table 1 and incorporating the alteration methods explored in the previous section to enhance its resilience against image manipulations. Each transformation is applied with 20% probability, besides the horizontal flip which remains at 50%, allowing the model to see unaltered images and images that have suffered one or multiple transformations.

However, it only detects 20.70% of images from DALLE-2, despite being trained on DALLE-3.

This approach ensures balanced performance between authentic and synthetic classes. In the case of GLIDE, due to image size constraints, we adjust the requirement to two out of three patches for synthetic prediction. The results of this image-level analysis are presented in Table 5, showing consistent improvements across all datasets. We observe performance increases of up to 11% of recall, with an average improvement of 3.4% across datasets. Optimizing the threshold for specific domain or dataset can be done using small subset of data, adjusting the detectors sensitivity to the frequency of artifacts found in specific domain. For instance, in the case of the In-the-wild dataset, Table 5 shows high recall in the synthetic class (89.9% and 92.9%) but also large number of false positives in the authentic class (33.0% and 33.8%). To address this, the threshold can be increased (e.g., requiring all five patches to indicate synthetic prediction for the entire image to be classified as such). As shown in Table 6, this setup significantly improves the models balance between authentic and synthetic image classification, increasing authentic recall by 31% while decreasing synthetic recall by 20% points. Notably, this adjustment results in performance comparable to that of the average human evaluator."

This compromises their utility, as it increases the number of false positive detections (misclassifying authentic images as synthetic). Meanwhile, GramNet, Rine and DIMD demonstrate consistently low false positive rates. Focusing on the models with reasonable amount of false positives (LGrad to DIMD in Table 7) still leads to contractive insights. At times the underlying generative model seems relevant for detection (variants of SD models are identified at higher rates, even for models not trained on diffusion) while other cases show discrepancies between datasets generated using the same model (DALLE3, SDXL). This evidence suggests complex relationship between training data, data sources and detection efficacy. Time and obsolescence are another critical factor, exemplified by LGrads diminished effectiveness on data beyond 2022. continuous evaluation of old detectors is thus recommended, together with the development of new detectors to keep pace with advancing generation techniques, particularly considering the significant existing blind spots in recent models (e.g., recalls over 90% are scarce). Finally, let us examine the behaviour on the In-the-wild, as an approximation of performance in practice. None of the tested detectors reaches recall above 50% for both the authentic and synthetic versions of it. The current best-performing models are DIMD and Rine (with large false negative rate), and SuSy and DeFake (with large false positive rate)."

            "content": "Results reveal certain patterns across detection models. Three models (GramNet, Dire and SuSy) exhibit balanced trade-off between false positives and false negatives, approximately losing in one recall what is gained in the other. For instance, Dire shows substantial improvement for authentic images (+25.88) but an analogous decrease for synthetic ones (23.97). This indicates that, for these models, changing the resolution changes the decision boundary, in way which is independent from the features characterizing the final discrimination between authentic and synthetic images. Such that, when the model becomes more/less sensitive, this affects equally both the authentic and synthetic predictions. Preliminary experimentation on Dire shows this symmetry to be consistent on other resolutions (512 512). One model collapses, suffering catastrophic losses after the resolution change. DIMDs average recall on the synthetic class drops 62%, while only gaining 1.5% on the authentic class. This could be caused by DIMDs avoidance of the downsampling step, making it more dependent on image scale. Regardless, it points towards the importance of considering model sensitivity during the design and training of detectors. This is valuable feature that is present in two other models, LGrad and Rine. Remarkably, their performance generalizes very well to scale changes. Lastly, DeFake stands out by showing large improvements in both recall scores (> +15%) under scale reduction. This may be caused by the Visual Language Model architecture empowering the detector, which could benefit from having the whole image context as input, despite losing frequency artifacts. We find these results to be consistent with the findings in [34]."

New and better generative models appear regularly,\nand detectors cannot generalize to all (see §6). Meanwhile, the\nincreasing realism of synthetically generated content brings along\na proportional demand for detectors, as tools for protecting social\ntrust and digital rights, while preventing disinformation.",
            "content": "The biggest challenge for detectors is generalization. Changes of generative model, data source, image post-processing and training task, affect detector performance, limiting their reliability. This work studied all these factors, starting with the underlying generative model used to produce the images. By temporally grounding our experiments, we observe how older models/datasets (less realistic and producing bigger artifacts) can be easily detected when trained for them, but are harder to generalize to when not seen during training (when compared to more recent generative models, see Table 2). This indicates the stronger biases defining older synthetic images are rarely found in newer datasets. As result, Bernabeu-Perez, Lopez-Cuena and Garcia-Gasulla including early generative models in the train set of new detector models should become common practice. Another consistent family of generative models that is consistently harder to generalize to are private models (e.g., DALLE3, Firefly), as shown in Tables 2, 5 and 7. This speaks of the importance of open science in the field. Data source is another key factor in detection. Using the same generative model, individuals employing various software and hardware configurations can produce significantly different content, to the point where generalization to the same model but different source often becomes challenging (see Tables 5 and 7). As result, detector models can never be assumed to work in data obtained from an untested source. This is further reinforced by tests conducted on data gathered In-the-wild, showing the dangerous effect of uncontrolled data sources. To mitigate this risk, recurrent sanity checks are recommended, as well as dataset-specific fine-tunes. common pitfall of detector models is the lack of proper characterization of authentic images. This has higher prevalence on binary classifiers  (Table 3)  but also happens on multi-class ones  (Table 5)  . Since characterizing authentic images is essential for practical use, specific tests using different sources of authentic data should be prioritized. Training on authentic data from many sources should also be common practice. This work shows how to train detectors that maximize generalization, by focusing on many different data sources and generative models. This alone is no guarantee, and diversity, even within the same source or model, is of essence. Our limited field study indicates that, while we are far from universal detector, models trained for specific targets may already be as good as humans at identifying synthetic content (see Table 6). The race between generators and detectors will go on, particularly since data from better generative models produces detectors that generalize better (see Table 2), while better detectors are likely to be used to improve generators. This leads to race equilibrium paradox, ensuring that the race for synthetic content detection is always going to be close one."

            "content": "The datasets used in this work are biased in many ways. Some of these biases are learnt by the models and could influence its decision in undesired ways (e.g., countryside images could be more likely to be tagged as synthetic than urban landscapes). The most effective mitigation strategy in this case is to conduct study on model performance, based on the existing populations within the application domain. Once undesirable biases are identified, these can be corrected through customized fine-tuning using synthetic data. Present and Future Generalization of Synthetic Image Detectors While all datasets used for training are publicly available, these may include samples with personal data. COCO contains images of real people, and synthetic datasets used could include realistic depictions of specific individuals. It is however unlikely, both for the training task and the size of SuSy, that such information would be encoded and retrieved from the released weights alone. final risk we consider is the use of released detector models for the purpose of training generative models that can overcome them (e.g., by adding specific loss). In fact, this is already common strategy in academia and industry (i.e., GANs), that can be applied to our work. To mitigate that, we add specific clause in the terms of use of the model prohibiting such practice. The alternative, not doing research in this line, would deprive society of means of protection against the increasing presence of synthetic images. Any detector model publicly released is compromised (e.g., by finding counterfactuals examples). We recommend potential users of SuSy to tune it on private data, as to mitigate that risk, while considering in the process the aforementioned limitations with regards to accuracy and bias. We also recommend fine-tuned model weights are kept private, as long as their public release holds no special academic or social value.
