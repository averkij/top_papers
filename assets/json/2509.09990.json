            "content": "Recently, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been fueled by the availability of high-quality pre-training data. However, these advancements have primarily benefitted highresource languages such as English and Chinese. In contrast, many languages with substantial user bases remain excluded due to the scarcity of suitable corpora, especially for specific tasks like headline generation. This exclusion poses challenges for both academic research and the practical application of AI technologies. This paper focuses on underrepresented minority languages in China, including Tibetan, Uyghur, and Mongolian, which have rich linguistic and cultural significance but suffer from lack of resources. Although these languages appear in multilingual datasets like OSCAR (Jansen et al., 2022) and CulturaX (Nguyen et al., 2024), quality issues limit their usefulness. As shown in Figure 1, there is Figure 1: The relationship between population size and dataset size in OSCAR (y-axis, in MB) for various high-, middle-, and low-resource languages. clear gap between the large speaker populations of these languages and the small amount of data available in major corpora. Studies also reveal problems with data quality: Zhang et al. (2024) found that 34% of the Uyghur data in CulturaX contains Kazakh or Arabic texts, pointing to issues like language misidentification and noise. These challenges of data scarcity and quality undermine efforts to build effective natural language processing (NLP) systems for these communities. Moreover, there is complete lack of opensource datasets tailored for headline generation in these minority languages. This gap hinders the development of supervised methods and benchmarks for headline generation tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Chinese Minority Headline Generation (CMHG), novel dataset specifically designed for headline generation in Tibetan, Uyghur, and Mongolian. CMHG consists of 100,000 Tibetan samples and 50,000 samples each for Uyghur and Mongolian. In addition to the main dataset, we collaborated with native speakers of these languages to further ensure data quality. From the existing data, we selected 3,000 samples for each language and conducted detailed annotation process to evaluate the alignment and quality of the headlines. These samples were reviewed by multiple annotators for each language, and only the data deemed high-quality by consensus among native annotators was retained. This subset of data provides reliable benchmark for future research, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in evaluating headline generation models. By combining large-scale dataset with carefully curated benchmark samples, CMHG bridges the gap in resources for headline generation in Chinese minority languages. In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions: We present CMHG, novel and large-scale open-source dataset specifically designed for headline generation in three Chinese minority languages: Tibetan, Uyghur, and Mongolian. We release this dataset. We provide carefully curated benchmark test set, annotated by native speakers, to ensure high-quality evaluation and support transparent, reproducible research in headline generation for Chinese minority languages. By introducing CMHG, we aim to fill the resource gap and pave the way for advancing natural language processing research on underrepresented languages. redundancy in the dataset, which could potentially bias the headline generation models. Text Normalization: We converted all characters to uniform encoding and removing any extraneous white spaces, special characters, or formatting inconsistencies. Language Purity Check:We sourced content from monolingual websites and used regexbased filtering to ensure linguistic purity in manually annotated data. Controlled noise was allowed in training data to improve model robustness. Additionally, we evaluated several existing Language Identification tools that claimed to support our target languages but found high false-positive rates. These steps were essential to ensure that the final dataset consisted of high-quality, relevant, and clean text that could be reliably used for our tasks."

            "content": "The Chinese Minority Headline Generation (CMHG) dataset, proposed in this paper, is sourced from various online platforms in China, including government documents and news articles (detailed list in Appendix A). We used web crawlers to collect the data, where the webpage title serves as the headline and the main text as the source content. To ensure data quality and reliability, we applied thorough cleaning process, with the main methods outlined as follows: Removal of Non-Textual Content: We filtered out non-textual elements such as advertisements, pop-ups, navigation bars, and multimedia (e.g., images, videos, and audio files). This ensured that only relevant text was retained. Duplicate Detection and Removal: We identified and removed duplicate entries to avoid The annotation process was designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of the evaluations. The annotators were provided with the following specific guidelines: Task Objective: Annotators were asked to assess the degree of relevance between the title and the content of the article and assign score accordingly. Title Evaluation: Annotators were first asked to identify any issues between the title and the article content, such as: Incomplete Article: whether the article content is incomplete, making it impossible for the title and content to match. Text Quality: whether the title contains spelling, grammatical, or contextual errors that would significantly hinder its match with the article content. Language Size Length In Token (Title/Content) Length In Characters (Title/Content) Cohens Îº ICC Same Tendency Tibetan 2901 Mongolian 2931 2950 Uyghur 12.3 / 376.7 27.2 / 429.8 30.2 / 815.7 74.0 / 1884.1 136.1 / 2149.0 151.0 / 4078. 0.71 0.28 0.44 0.80 0.42 0.67 1.00 0.85 1.00 Table 1: Annotation Results and Inter-Annotator Agreement Analysis for Valid Samples in the CMHG Dataset. Token length is counted by the CINO (Yang et al., 2022) tokenizer; character length by raw character count. Other Issues: whether there is any other noticeable discrepancies between the title and content, such as irrelevance. (e.g., the majority rated the title as \"matching,\" but the annotator rated it as \"not matching\"), the annotation would be discarded. If no major issues were identified, the titlecontent match was considered \"Normal.\" Matching Score: Annotators were instructed to rate the match based on how well the title corresponded with the article content. The scoring system was as follows: 1 point: Completely Mismatched (The title is entirely unrelated to the content). 2 points: Slightly Mismatched (The title is related to the content but does not align with the main theme). 3 points: Slightly Inaccurate (There is some connection, but it is not fully aligned). 4 points: Uncertain (The relationship between title and content is unclear or ambiguous). 5 points: Slightly Matched (There is strong connection, but there are some inconsistencies). 6 points: Well Matched (The title matches the content with only minor discrepancies). 7 points: Fully Matched (The title perfectly corresponds to the content)."

The following steps were implemented to guarantee the quality of the annotations: Consistency Check: An annotation was considered invalid if the score differed by more than 2 points from the majority of annotators. Additionally, if an annotators judgment deviated significantly from the majority opinion Handling Invalid Annotations: Invalid annotations were removed, and the annotators are incentivized to not produce such annotations. 3.3 Incentive System To encourage careful and consistent annotation work, we implemented reward-based incentive system: Scores < 4 or 4 are considered as different tendencies: Scores < 4 indicate non-aligned tendency. Scores 4 indicate an aligned tendency. Annotation whose tendency aligns with the majority will receive 0.25 RMB. Annotation that aligns with the majority tendency and furthermore deviates by no more than 1.5 points from the average score will receive an additional 0.25 RMB. Annotators were strongly encouraged to adhere to the guidelines to ensure the high quality and consistency of the dataset annotations."

After removing the data flagged as mismatched or erroneous by the annotators, we retained the samples with an average score above 4. The final number of valid samples and the average length for each language are shown in Table 1. Most retained samples scored 7, achieving an average score of 6.9/7, which confirms the effectiveness of our native-speaker-guided annotation process. The average title and content lengths reflect the linguistic characteristics of these minority languages. Tibetan titles and contents have shorter average lengths (12.3 tokens/74.0 characters for titles, 376.7 tokens/1884.1 characters for contents) compared to the significantly longer Mongolian and Uyghur samples. tated samples per language is resource-intensive, we also selected high-quality subset for evaluation to facilitate future works. Specifically, we chose the top 500 annotated samples based on evaluation scores to create high-quality small sample version, enabling more efficient performance assessment while maintaining data quality. 3.5 Inter-Annotator Agreement Analysis We assessed inter-annotation agreement using Cohens Îº, ICC, and Same Tendency Rating for each language  (Table 1)  . Despite some variability in specific ratings and low Cohens kappa for B0 and MN groups, the Same Tendency Rating was consistently high, indicating agreement on trends and supporting data reliability."

The fine-tuning results for the small models, cino-cum and swcm, show that both models achieved competitive ROUGE-L scores, demonstrating that finetuning with the CMHG dataset enables the models to generate concise and contextually accurate headlines for all three languages. This indicates that the large amount of non-annotated data collected in the CMHG dataset plays crucial role in enhancing model performance for these underrepresented languages. For the large models, Qwen2.5-72B and LLaMA3.1-70B, the few-shot results, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3, reveal strong performance across both small and large sample tests. This demonstrates that the models exhibit high-quality headline generation capabilities, regardless of the sample size, highlighting the effectiveness of using small annotated datasets for evaluating model performance. The ability of these models to perform well with just few annotated samples supports the idea that the CMHG dataset, with its carefully curated annotated samples, can serve as reliable benchmark for future research and evaluation in headline generation for minority languages. Overall, both the fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches contribute significantly to advancing headline generation for minority languages, and the CMHG dataset proves to be valuable resource for further research in this area."

            "content": "Despite CMHGs significant contribution to headline generation for Chinese minority languages, some limitations remain. First, while the CMHG dataset represents substantial effort to address the data scarcity issue for Tibetan, Uyghur, and Mongolian, the availability of high-quality linguistic resources for these languages is still limited compared to high-resource languages. The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets for other minority languages in China and beyond further highlights the need for continued efforts to expand the scope of language resources. Additionally, the current dataset focuses primarily on headline generation tasks, leaving other NLP applications underexplored. Future work will aim to broaden the dataset to include more minority languages and diverse NLP tasks, alongside collaborations with native speakers and linguistic experts to enhance data quality and coverage, fostering more inclusive and comprehensive NLP research for underrepresented languages."
