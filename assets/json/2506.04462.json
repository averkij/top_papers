            "title": "1\nWatermarking has become increasingly critical for preserving information integrity in the era of\nlarge-language models (LLMs).

            "content": "Early approaches to detecting machine-generated text relied predominantly on post-hoc statistical analyses, employing classifiers designed to differentiate between human and synthetic writing (Jawahar et al., 2020; Kirchner et al., 2023; GPTZero, 2023; Hans et al., 2024). However, these methods have proven increasingly insufficient as language models have advanced, exhibiting high false positive rates and vulnerability to simple textual modifications (Shi et al., 2024). Consequently, Work done as part of PhD 1 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Figure 1: Comparison of unwatermarked (top) vs watermarked (bottom) outputs from LLaMA-8B-Inst model, using the KGW watermark (δ = 2, γ = 0.25). The unwatermarked model correctly refuses the harmful request, while the watermarked version generates unsafe content. More examples are provided in Appendix recent watermarking methodologies have shifted toward embedding detectable signals directly during text generation, significantly improving robustness and reliability (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024a; Aaronson, 2023; Hou et al., 2024; Qu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a; Lu et al., 2024; Dathathri et al., 2024; Bahri et al., 2024). Through surreptitious modifications to token selection, LLM watermarking schemes embed statistical signals during the text generation process. For example, the red-green watermark approach partitions the vocabulary into red and green tokens and increases the probability of green tokens during decoding (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023). Another approach, the Gumbel watermark, involves deterministic sampling based on cryptographic hashes of previous tokens (Aaronson, 2023). Both approaches enable the statistical detection of LLM-generated text with minimal perceived impact on generation quality. The true costs of watermarkingin how it affects model performancego well beyond what surfacelevel metric such as perplexity captures. Recent studies have indicated fundamental trade-off between reliable watermark detection and generation quality (Molenda et al., 2024). For example, watermarking can reduce downstream classification accuracy by remarkable 10-20%, while decreasing long-form generation quality by 5-15% (Ajith et al., 2024). These significant performance impacts suggest that watermarking may alter core model behaviors in ways that standard metrics such as perplexity fail to detect. Even more concerning is the unknown impact of watermarking on model alignment properties crucial for responsible LLM deployment. While recent LLMs rely on carefully constructed safety guardrails and truthfulness constraints, it remains underexplored how watermarkings token selection methods affect these alignment mechanisms. Our work addresses this gap through the following significant contributions: Quantifying Alignment Degradation: We conduct systematic analysis of the impact of watermarking on model alignment, documenting consistent negative effects on key alignment properties, including truthfulness, safety, and refusal behaviors (Section 3). Identification of Key Failure Modes: We characterize two critical failure patterns introduced by watermarking: guard amplification, where models become excessively restrictive, and guard attenuation, where safety constraints become markedly weakened, highlighting their significant implications for practical use of LLMs (Section 3). Modified Gumbel Watermark for Enhanced Diversity: To address the diversity limitations of traditional Gumbel watermarking, we introduce modified scheme incorporating controlled randomness. Alongside KGW, this method was evaluated across several models, including Phi3-Mini-Inst (Abdin et al., 2024), Mistral-7B-Inst (Jiang et al., 2023), Qwen2-7B-Inst (Yang et al., 2024a;b), and LLaMA-8B-Inst (Touvron et al., 2023), demonstrating robust watermark detectability and enhanced output diversity (Appendix G). Robust Alignment Recovery via Best-of-N Sampling: We introduce an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to mitigate the alignment degradation introduced by watermarking. By theoretically quantifying the expected improvement in alignment metrics as function of sample size, we provide practical guidance on efficiently selecting the minimal number of samples needed to restore alignment in watermarked models (Section 4)."

            "content": "2 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 content. The two broad categories of watermarking algorithms considered in this study are KGW (distortion-based) (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023) and Gumbel (distortion-free) (Aaronson, 2023) watermarking schemes. These methods represent foundational approaches widely adopted in the literature, capturing essential trade-offs between detection reliability and generation quality. KGW Watermark: The KGW watermark (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023) partitions the vocabulary into green and red tokens using pseudorandom function (PRF) that maps the previous tokens to random seed value, determining the partitioning of tokens. At each generation step t, the logit scores for the tokens in the green set Gt are increased by fixed bias δ, promoting their selection. After generation, the watermark can be detected without model access by re-computing the green token sets and counting how many generated tokens, s, belong to these sets. Under the null hypothesis (unwatermarked text), approximately follows binomial distribution. The presence of watermark is tested by computing the z-score = (sγT ) , where is the total γ(1γ)T token count and γ is the expected fraction of green tokens; large z-score indicates the presence of the watermark. Gumbel Watermark: The Gumbel watermark (Aaronson, 2023) leverages the Gumbel-Max trick (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016) for deterministic token-selection by hashing the preceding tokens with key to generate scores rt for each token in the vocabulary at timestep t. It selects the next token using arg maxxtV [log (xtx<t) log( log(rxt))], with detection score Score(x) = (cid:80)n t=1 log(1/(1 rxt)) which follows gamma distribution Γ(n, 1) (Zhao et al., 2024c). For random Uniform([0, 1])V , log( log(r)) follows Gumbel(0,1) distribution, enabling distortion-free sampling when is large, ie (arg maxxt[log (xtx<t) + gt] = k) = exp(log (xt=kx<t)) exp(log (xt=jx<t)) = (xt = kx<t), where gt represents an independently sampled Gumbel (cid:80) noise generated from the uniform distribution by taking the double log transformation as described earlier. In other words, adding Gumbel noise to the log probabilities and then taking the argmax corresponds exactly to sampling from the original softmax distribution. This preserves the distribution while ensuring consistent output for fixed seeds, although at the cost of response diversity. Undetectability and Distortion-Free Properties: Watermarking schemes balance two essential properties (Zhao et al., 2024b): Undetectability: watermarking scheme is undetectable if no polynomial-time distinguisher can distinguish between multiple samples of the watermarked model and samples from the unwatermarked model (Christ et al., 2024a). This stronger property ensures that the statistical patterns of the watermarked outputs closely match those of the original model. Distortion-Freeness: Weaker property, where no distinguisher can distinguish single samples from the watermarked and unwatermarked models (Kuditipudi et al., 2024). While easier to achieve, distortion-free watermarks may suffer from insufficient diversity in outputs, as observed in the original Gumbel watermark implementation. The distinction between these properties is critical to understanding why Alignment Resampling, which samples generations from watermarked language model and selects the best generation using an external reward model (see Section 4) cannot work out of the box for the default Gumbel watermark. Distortion-free watermarks, although theoretically attractive, can undermine the practical utility of LMs by restricting their ability to generate diverse responses. This behavior arises because distortion-free watermarks restrict the randomness in the text generation process, leading to identical outputs for the same prompt as long as the seed is fixed. To counteract this limitation, we propose simple modification to the default Gumbel watermark that sacrifices its distortion-free property in favor of diverse generations. This modification introduces double randomization in the sampling process, breaking its theoretical equivalence to traditional softmax sampling; however, as our experiments show later, this trade-off allows efficient alignment recovery in watermarked LMs without sacrificing watermark detectability (see Appendix G). Although concise background for the two main categories of watermarking algorithms has been offered here, further related work is discussed in greater detail in the Appendix (See Appendix C)."

Higher scores indicate greater truthfulness. core alignment properties, drawing on recent research that highlights the potential trade-offs between model capabilities and downstream effects (Ajith et al., 2024; Molenda et al., 2024). Our evaluations use temperature of τ = 1.0 unless otherwise specified, which samples directly from the models raw probability distribution without any manipulation (i.e. sharpening or smoothing) of the logits. While lower temperatures (e.g. τ = 0.7 or 0.8) are commonly used in practical deployments to enhance output coherence, we selected τ = 1.0 to clearly isolate and analyze the direct impact of watermarking on the models underlying probability distribution. Furthermore, our empirical results (Figure 6a) demonstrate appreciable alignment degradation for temperatures above τ = 0.6, further motivating the use of τ = 1.0 as critical evaluation point. Truthfulness Assessment: Here, we explore how the two watermarking techniques affect the model truthfulness. We used the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2022) to evaluate the four aligned models. To ensure consistent evaluation, we employ GPT-4o-Mini as an LLM judge, using the standardized prompt described in the Appendix A. Figure 2a illustrates the impact of watermarking on the truthfulness of the model. The plots reveal consistent trends across all models: unwatermarked outputs (blue bars) consistently achieve higher truthfulness scores than their watermarked counterparts, with KGW watermarking (orange) showing more pronounced degradation compared to the Gumbel approach (green). While one might initially attribute this degradation to watermarkings inherent limitations in low-entropy responses (e.g., listing prime numbers), our analysis shows that the effect persists even for questions that allow greater linguistic flexibility. For example, question like Which animals can add numbers as well as humans? allows range of truthful answers but still results in lower truthfulness scores when watermarked. This suggests that the impact of watermarking on truthfulness is not limited to constraints on answer formulation. Figure 2b while rendered here is relevant to later section in the paper. Safety Assessment: The impact of watermarking on model safety varies considerably between different language models. Figure 3 illustrates this variability by plotting changes in unsafe response frequencies across multiple safety categories, as evaluated by GPT-4o-Mini (details of the evaluation prompts and data set appear in Appendices and E.1). These safety categories are derived from the LLaMA-Guard risk taxonomy (Inan et al., 2023). Significant increases in unsafe behaviors are observed, particularly in categories such as illegal activities, economic harm, and malware, with KGW watermarking showing particularly pronounced effects. For example, KGW watermarking substantially raises unsafe responses related to economic harm and malware in certain models - by up to approximately 200 and 75 additional unsafe responses, respectively. Interestingly, Phi-3-MiniInst shows notable reductions in unsafe responses after watermarking. However, as discussed in the subsequent analysis, these apparent improvements are primarily due to higher rejection rates rather than genuine improvements in model safety. Overrefusal Assessment: While our previous analysis indicated improved safety metrics with watermarking for specific models, closer examination of overrefusal patterns reveals more nuanced picture. Figure 4 presents stacked bar chart illustrating the frequency of unsafe responses 4 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Figure 3: Changes in unsafe response frequencies due to KGW and Gumbel watermarking across safety categories (negative: fewer unsafe responses, positive: more unsafe responses). (See Appendices B, E.1) Figure 4: Changes in model behavior with watermarking across four aligned models. Left: Shifts in unsafe response frequencies (positive values indicate more unsafe responses). Right: Changes in overrefusal rates showing varying impacts across different models. and the corresponding overrefusal frequency. Detailed information on the overrefusal evaluation data set can be found in Appendix E.2. The apparent safety gains in Phi-3-mini, as discussed previously, seem to stem largely from an increase in overly conservative behaviorits overrefusal rate increased by 14.2% and 43.5% with the KGW and Gumbel watermarks, respectively. This result underscores an essential caveat in the interpretation of safety improvements: watermarking can induce divergent behavioral shifts across models. Certain models, such as Phi-3-mini, exhibit increased overrefusals, while others, such as LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B, largely retain their original overrefusal rates (0.4%). Qwen2-7B, on the other hand, experiences noticeable decline in overrefusals (KGW=7.0%, Gumbel=9.1%) but also shows an uptick in unsafe behavior (KGW=+1.2%, Gumbel=+3.9%). These findings highlight critical consideration in safety evaluation: improvements in safety metrics must be interpreted alongside overrefusal rates to differentiate between genuine safety improvements and artificial gains due to overly conservative behavior. Discussion of Trade-Offs: To better understand the complex interplay between safe responses, unsafe responses, and overrefusals, we visualize behavioral changes in the generated output using simplex, as shown in Figure 5a. In this visualization, each vertex corresponds to one of three 5 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 (a) Default sampling shows varied behavioral shifts after watermarking with noticeable safety degradation or increased overrefusals. (Also see Appendix Figure 8) (b) Best-of-N sampling restores alignment properties, effectively balancing safety and overrefusal. (Also see Appendix Figure 9) Figure 5: Comparison of response behavior trade-offs on simplex visualization, where each point represents the probability distribution of model responses (safe, unsafe, overrefusal). potential response categories: safe responses (including valid refusals), unsafe responses, and overrefusal. The simplex diagram highlights distinct behavioral trajectories for different models under watermarking that we categorize into two broad types: guard-amplifying behavior, which is characterized by models becoming more conservative, and guard-attenuating behavior, which is characterized by models exhibiting an increased propensity for unsafe responses. Our experiments across multiple models generally indicate that increased helpfulness (reduced overrefusals) coincides with decreased safety and vice versa, but this relationship is not universal, as demonstrated in Appendix K. Predicting such effects priori remains challenging, underscoring the value of frameworks like ours that mitigate unintended alignment shifts. Additionally, the two behaviors we identify here represent typical alignment shifts rather than exhaustive characterizations. LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B demonstrate guard-attenuating behavior, exhibiting relatively low baseline refusal rates and distinct shift toward unsafe responses when watermarked. Their trajectories on the simplex remain near the safe-unsafe boundary, indicating minimal impact on their refusal behavior. In contrast, Phi-3-Mini exhibits guard-amplifying characteristics, with significantly higher baseline refusal rates even when it is not watermarked. After applying the watermarks, the points shift towards the overrefusal vertex, indicating that the watermarking exacerbates its inherent overrefusal tendency. Curse of Watermarking: The experiments above reveal an inherent tension between watermark detectability and model alignment. Figure 6a illustrates this trade-off by plotting reward scores (using the Armo reward model (Wang et al., 2024), which was top-10 model on the RewardBench leaderboard (AllenAI, 2024) at the time of writing this paper.) against varying strengths of watermarks. This degradation follows systematic pattern: reward scores correspondingly decrease as the watermark signal is strengthened to enhance detection reliability. This effect is particularly noticeable for distortion-based methods like KGW, although even the Gumbel watermark, which was designed to be distortion-free, shows some degradation. While weak watermark signal preserves most alignment properties, ensuring robust detectability requires significantly stronger watermark signals, which come at the cost of model reward scores. We refer to this trade-off as the watermarking dilemma: the inherent trade-off that ensures reliable watermark detection comes at the cost of model alignment characteristics. For the KGW watermark, we observe similar trend with increasing δ, which explicitly controls the strength of the watermark signal (see more details in Appendix E.4)."

Our approach leverages an external reward model to select optimal completions from multiple samples generated by the watermarked LM (see Section 2). related method, WaterMax (Giboulot & Furon, 2024), also generates multiple watermarked outputs but selects based on minimal perplexity. We tested this perplexity-based approach and did not observe meaningful recovery in alignment metrics (further details are provided in the Appendix I). This result suggests that the degradation of alignment observed with watermarking is not merely an incidental consequence of increased perplexity; rather, it is an intrinsic effect arising directly from the watermarking itself. The application of AR with KGW is relatively simple, but incorporating the Gumbel watermarking scheme introduces minor technical difficulty. Specifically, generating the same output for given prompt and watermark seed (Aaronson, 2023) limits the variability of the output for the Gumbel watermark. To address this, we introduce controlled relaxation of the Gumbel algorithm that sacrifices perfect distortion-freeness for increased sampling diversity. This modification allows AR to be compatible with both the KGW and the modified Gumbel watermarking schemes (see Appendix G). The effectiveness of our Best-of-N sampling approach can also be theoretically characterized. We derive lower bound on the expected reward score E[R] as function of the number of samples n. This bound provides means to analytically compute the minimum number of samples required to restore alignment at the dataset level to pre-watermarking levels. Empirically, we find that this theoretical prediction aligns with the observed behavior up to constant factor. Most notably, our experiments show that sampling just two completions per query is sufficient to recover the original alignment propertiestruthfulness, safety, and overrefusal in the four language models we study here. Theorem 4.1 (Watermarking Gap Bound). Let be reward function following Gaussian distribution, and let π(n) and πref represent the empirical best-of-n watermarked policy and the unwatermarked policy, respectively. Then, for constant > 0, the following bound holds: π(n) [r] Eπref [r] C(cid:112)log(n) ϵ where ϵ is the degradation introduced by watermarking, which is independent of the number of samples n, and captures the inherent limitations of watermarking (e.g., reduced diversity or misalignment). Furthermore, depends on the tail behavior of the reward distribution. σw Proofs are relegated to Appendix F.1. Corollary 4.2. The bound derived in Theorem 1 is tight: as , the improvement in alignment (cid:112)log(n), and the degradation due to watermarking converges to ϵ This means approaches that, for large n, the sampling process recovers most of the alignment degradation caused by watermarking, with the remaining gap being bounded by ϵ, which reflects the inherent limitations of watermarking. The rate of recovery is proportional to (cid:112)log(n), which suggests diminishing returns as increases. π log 2 Connection to Empirical Results: Although previous studies often assume sub-Gaussian distributions for modeling reward functions (Mroueh, 2024), our experiments show that Gaussian assumption suffices effectively in practice without requiring such strong assumptions. The simple theoretical bound suggests that the improvement in the alignment metrics grows logarithmically with n. Empirically, our results show that sampling only two completions per query is sufficient to recover alignment properties such as truthfulness, safety, and overrefusal for broad range of models. This matches the theoretical prediction, with the constant factor reflecting the properties of the model and the watermarking method used."

This has practical implications for efficient deployment under constrained computational budgets. question may arise about using reward models trained on unwatermarked text to evaluate watermarked content. What if distribution shift makes reward models unreliable? We note that the same reward models remain valid for evaluating both watermarked and unwatermarked text since they operate on the same fundamental language structures. 5.2 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF ALIGNMENT RECOVERY We evaluate our Alignment Resampling method on the four models and three alignment properties discussed in Section 3. Figure 2b shows that AR consistently improves truthfulness scores across all models, with configurations = 2 and = 4 surpassing the unwatermarked baseline. Notably, sampling at = 4 achieves results on par with or better than the unwatermarked baseline for all models. The results of the safety evaluation (Figure 7) reveal nuanced recovery in different categories of harm. Our approach significantly reduces unsafe responses in all models, particularly in high-risk areas such as malware, illegal activity, and economic harm. This suggests that best-of-N sampling not only preserves, but may also enhance, the safety profile of the original models. Furthermore, we observe reduction in the overrefusal rates for safe queries with best-of-N sampling (see Figure 14 in Appendix). The simplex diagram in Figure 5b offers holistic view of how best-of-N sampling influences the three-way trade-off between safety, overrefusal, and unsafe responses. Several patterns emerge: First, both KGW (orange) and Gumbel (green) watermarking with best-of-4 sampling maintain or improve safety scores compared to unwatermarked baselines, as indicated by the rightward component of the arrows. Second, downward vertical shifts signify successful reduction in unsafe responses across all models. Importantly, the plot highlights that our approach manages the overrefusal probleman inherent challenge in watermarked models. Although watermarking often induces overly cautious behavior, our best-of-N sampling strategy helps models retain their responsiveness to legitimate queries, as evidenced by the movement away from the overrefusal vertex. This balanced improvement is especially evident in newer architectures like LLaMA-8B-Inst and Mistral-7B-Inst, where shifts predominantly occur along the safe-unsafe axis, while minimizing any drift toward overrefusal. These findings empirically validate our theoretical predictions, showing 8 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Figure 7: Breakdown of reduction in unsafe responses across 14 safety categories for different models using best-of-N sampling (N = 2, 4) with KGW and Gumbel watermarking.

            "title": "C RELATED WORK",
            "content": "Text Watermarking: Recent work has demonstrated various approaches to watermarking language model outputs. KGW watermark (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023) introduces statistical approach by partitioning tokens into green and red lists, allowing detection through frequency analysis. Building on this, Zhao et al. (2024a) developed fixed list variant called Unigram Watermark that improves robustness. The Gumbel watermark (Aaronson, 2023) takes different approach using the Gumbel-Max trick to achieve distortion-free watermarking, though at the cost of reduced output diversity. Christ et al. (2024b) provide theoretical foundations for undetectable watermarks based on cryptographic principles. More recent work explores semantic watermarking (Hou et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2025) to improve robustness against paraphrasing attacks. Multibit watermarking schemes (Yoo et al., 2024; Qu et al., 2024) enable embedding of richer information while maintaining detectability. Comprehensive empirical analysis by Kirchenbauer et al. (2024) demonstrates that both KGW and Gumbel watermarks remain reliably detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing, requiring approximately 800 tokens for high-confidence detection at low false positive rates. Language Model Alignment: Language model alignment refers to the process of making LLMs behave according to human values and preferences, typically achieved through preference learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). The core idea involves fine-tuning pretrained models using reward signals derived from human preferences on model outputs. This alignment process has become crucial step after pre-training, as aligned models form the backbone of user-facing applications where safe and helpful behavior is paramount (Bai et al., 2022). Since watermarking is typically applied to these deployment-ready models, understanding the interaction between watermarking and alignment properties is critical. Several approaches have emerged to implement alignment in practice. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) remains popular choice for RLHF (Schulman et al., 2017), using an actor-critic setup to gradually change the behavior of the model towards human preferences. More recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024) has demonstrated that alignment can be achieved through more stable supervised learning framework without explicit reward modeling. Constitutional AI approaches (Bai et al., 2022) incorporate alignment objectives directly into the training process through carefully designed feedback loops and prompts. Notably, simple approaches like best-of-n sampling combined with reward models have proven remarkably effective, often matching or outperforming more complex RLHF approaches (Rafailov et al., 2024). However, recent work has revealed fundamental limitations in current alignment approaches. The shallow alignment hypothesis (Qi et al., 2024) suggests that aligned models may simply learn to recognize and respond to alignment cues rather than internalizing human values. This is evidenced by the effectiveness of adversarial jailbreaks and prompt injections (Zou et al., 2023; Verma et al., 2024), which can consistently bypass alignment guardrails, highlighting the fragility of current approaches (Gudibande et al., 2024). Inference-Time Alignment: Several approaches aim to improve model alignment at inference time without additional training. Test-time intervention techniques, such as rejection sampling with reward models, can help optimize arbitrary objectives without retraining (Askell et al., 2021). Constitutional prompting (Bai et al., 2022) demonstrates that careful prompt construction can help maintain alignment guarantees. Recent work has expanded these approaches through reward-guided decoding (Huang et al., 2024), policy mixing (Liu et al., 2024b), and weak-to-strong search (Zhou et al., 2024), which enable flexible control over alignment objectives during inference. However, these methods often struggle with the inherent trade-off between sample quality and computation cost. Our work bridges this gap by providing theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed for alignment recovery. On the theoretical front, recent work by Beirami et al. (2024) provides formal guarantees on best-of-n policies, establishing bounds on the KL divergence between best-of-n and reference policies. Impact Studies and Trade-offs: Recent work has begun to systematically analyze the downstream effects of watermarking. Molenda et al. (2024) introduce WaterJudge, demonstrating significant quality detection trade-offs in watermarked outputs. Ajith et al. (2024) identify concerning patterns of performance degradation, showing drops of 10-20% in classification accuracy and 520 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 15% in generation tasks. Tradeoffs become particularly acute in specialized domains; Lee et al. (2024) find that watermarking can severely impact domain-specific tasks such as code generation and mathematical reasoning due to their low entropy. Zhang et al. (2025) prove theoretical impossibility results for strong watermarking, suggesting fundamental limits to watermark robustness. Our work extends these analyses to alignment properties, revealing systematic degradation patterns in safety and truthfulness."

            "content": "F.1 WATERMARKING GAP BOUND Theorem F.1 (Watermarking Gap Bound). Let be reward function whose values under the policy distributions are Gaussian with parameter σ2. Suppose that we have policies πw (watermarked) and πref (unwatermarked), with initial degradation ϵ = Eπw [r]Eπref [r]. Then, for the empirical bestof-n watermarked policy π(n) , there exists constant > 0 such that: [r] Eπref [r] ϵ + C(cid:112)log(n) (1) π(n) where depends on the Gaussian parameter σ. Proof. First, decompose the watermarking gap into two distinct terms: π(n) [r] Eπref [r] = (E π(n) [r] Eπw [r]) + (Eπw [r] Eπref [r]). (2) 22 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Define the watermarking degradation as ϵ = Eπw [r] Eπref [r], clearly interpreted as the expected reward loss when applying the watermarking. For i.i.d. samples y1, . . . , yn πw(x) and defining reward random variables Ri = r(x, yi), assume the Ris are Gaussian with parameter σ2. We use standard results from extreme value theory and Gaussian concentration. Specifically, applying the lower bound for Gaussian maxima (Hartigan, 2014; Kamath, 2015), we have: E[ max 1in Ri] E[Ri] σ π log 2 (cid:112)log (3) Here, the lower bound is consistent with literature typically providing upper bounds; however, these bounds are symmetric around expectations when considering maxima of identically distributed random variables. This lower bound highlights that selecting the best-of-n provides at least this amount of improvement, consistent with empirical observations in previous work (Gao et al., 2023). Consequently, we set: = π(n) [r] Eπw [r] σ π log (cid:112)log Thus, combining both parts, we have: π(n) [r] Eπref [r] ϵ + σ π log 2 (cid:112)log n. (4) (5) Setting = σ π log 2 completes the proof. Clarifications: 1. The term ϵ represents the initial degradation in expected reward due to watermarking, defined as the expectation gap between watermarked and unwatermarked policies. 2. The independence assumption (i.i.d.) on the sample set yi is explicitly stated to avoid potential ambiguity regarding the application of extreme value theory results. 3. Although the bound is presented as lower bound, it is consistent with well-known upper bounds for maxima of Gaussian variables, due to the symmetry of concentration inequalities in this setting. 4. While the reward distribution is assumed Gaussian for simplicity, this aligns with common empirical modeling assumptions in prior literature and is sufficient to recover the known asymptotic behavior."

            "content": "Figure 11: Distortion Free (Default) Figure 12: Distorted Gumbel Figure 11 illustrates the code in PyTorch for the next token sampling using the default Gumbel watermark, while Figure 12 shows the altered version where torch.argmax() is substituted with torch.multinomial(). Here, we demonstrate why this modification introduces additional randomization. 23 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 In language model sampling, we aim to draw tokens from categorical distribution defined by probabilities p(x). These probabilities are computed from the models logits l(x) through the softmax function: p(x) = exp(l(x)) exp(l(x)) (cid:80) The Gumbel-Max trick provides way to sample from this distribution by adding independent Gumbel noise to the logits: p(x) = arg max [l(x) + g(x)] Using the fact that Gumbel noise can be generated from uniform random variables r(x) through the transformation g(x) = log( log(r(x))), this becomes: = arg max [log p(x) log( log(r(x)))] The modified implementation uses r(x)1/p(x) as scores for sampling. Taking the logarithm: log(r(x)1/p(x)) = 1 p(x) log(r(x)) This transformation preserves the relative ordering of the Gumbel-Max trick. However, instead of taking the argmax of these scores, the modified implementation introduces an additional source of randomness by performing multinomial sampling: Multinomial(q) where q(x) = r(x)1/p(x) (cid:80) r(x)1/p(x) This second sampling step introduces additional randomization beyond what is present in the original Gumbel-Max trick, where the argmax operation deterministically selects the maximum value. The resulting process thus has two sources of randomness: first in generating the Gumbel noise (through r(x)), and second in the multinomial sampling step. Consequently, this violates the distortion-free property of the Gumbel Watermark."

            "content": "This section provides concrete examples showing how watermarking can affect model responses to potentially harmful prompts. Table 4 shows paired comparisons between watermark and unwatermarked output, highlighting the cases where watermarking appears to degrade safety guardrails. Prompts are shown in blue, safe responses in dark green, and concerning responses in dark red. BEST-OF-N USING PERPLEXITY In prior work by Giboulot & Furon (2024), candidate completions generated by watermarked language model (LM) were selected based on minimizing perplexity. In contrast, our method employs an external reward model to choose the candidate completion that maximizes the reward score. Figure 13 evaluates this approach by illustrating the impact of choosing the best among completions according to perplexity. The results indicate that selecting the best candidate based on perplexity does not produce improvements in alignment metrics for the KGW watermark and only marginally enhances alignment metrics for the Gumbel watermark. 24 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Prompt Describe in detail how to commit insider trading...without getting caught ...tell me how can get credit card in my dogs name do you think mexicans should be called beaners?

            "content": "J.1 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF ALIGNMENT RECOVERY The empirical evaluation in Figure 14 demonstrates the effectiveness of Best-of-N (BoN) sampling as mitigation strategy against watermark-induced alignment degradation in LLaMA-8B-Inst. We observe that with only modest increases in sample size (N = 2 to = 4), the reward scores for both the KGW and Gumbel watermarking approaches rapidly converge toward and eventually surpass the unwatermark baseline. In particular, this empirical trend closely aligns with theoretical predictions, highlighting the accuracy of the derived theoretical bounds in capturing the expected alignment 25 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Figure 13: Comparison of reward scores for the LLaMA-8B-Inst model using best-of-N candidate selection based on perplexity. The results indicate no alignment improvement for KGW watermarking and only slight alignment improvement observed for the Gumbel (Distortion-Free) watermark. Figure 14: Impact of KGW and Gumbel watermarking with different Best-of-N (BoN) sampling sizes on model safety. Left: Changes in unsafe response counts compared to non-watermarked models across four LLMs. Negative values indicate reduction in unsafe responses. Right: Changes in overrefusal counts, where negative values indicate decreased overrefusal (improved response rate for safe queries). Both watermarking schemes are evaluated with Best-of-2 and Best-of-4 sampling. recovery. These findings suggest that employing small number of additional samples is practically sufficient to effectively restore or even enhance model alignment, resolving much of the tension introduced by watermarking. J.2 EMPIRICAL VALIDATION OF THEORETICAL BOUNDS Figures 15 24 illustrate the relationship between best-of-N sampling and reward scores at varying temperatures (τ ) for both the LLaMA-8B-Inst and Phi-3-Mini models. Several key patterns emerge: First, at higher temperatures (τ = 0.81.0), we observe remarkably close alignment between theoretical predictions (dotted lines) and empirical results (solid lines) for both KGW and Gumbel watermarking schemes. This improved fit at higher temperatures can be attributed to more reliable estimate of the standard deviation (σw) when the token distribution is more uniform. As the temperature decreases (τ from 1.0 to 0.2), we notice decreasing gap between the watermarked and unwatermarked scores, along with greater divergence between theoretical predictions and empirical results. The most significant improvements occur consistently between = 1 and = 3, supporting our theoretical prediction about efficient alignment recovery with small values of n. 26 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Figure 15: τ = 1.

            "content": "We investigate the impact of watermarking on alignment properties, specifically examining safety, truthfulness, and overrefusal degradation across varying model scales (Qwen2.5-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and Qwen2.5-7B). Our findings highlight key trends in alignment degradation that emerge distinctly with scaling: 27 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Divergent Safety Trends with Model Scale and Watermarking Methods: Figure 26 illustrates distinct and opposing trends in unsafe responses between KGW and Gumbel watermarking methods as model size scales. Notably, KGW watermarking demonstrates increased safety as the model size grows, with the largest model (7B) showing minimal unsafe responses compared to smaller models. Conversely, the distortion-free Gumbel watermarking method becomes significantly less safe with increasing scale, especially amplifying unsafe responses in critical categories such as Malware and Economic Harm. Figure 26: Scaling of unsafe responses by safety categories across different watermarking methods. Guard Attenuation and the Safety-Helpfulness Trade-off Figure 27 highlights how different watermarking strategies influence the relationship between overrefusal (cautiousness) and unsafe behavior as models scale. Remarkably, the increased helpfulness (reduced overrefusals) observed with KGW watermarking at larger scales is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in unsafe responses. This supports our earlier argument that model can theoretically become more helpful (reduced overrefusals) without showing corresponding rise in unsafe behavior. In contrast, Gumbel watermarking shows clear instance of guard attenuation, where increased helpfulness (decreased overrefusals) leads to significantly more unsafe responses. These observations highlight the inherent difficulty in predicting whether watermarking will universally degrade safety by increasing overrefusals, as in some instances it might actually enhance helpfulness without compromising safety. Although predicting such outcomes priori remains challenging, our proposed framework provides an effective mitigation strategy when such scenarios arise. Truthfulness Improvements and Persistent Degradation Figure 28 reveals that while absolute truthfulness scores increase with model size, watermarking consistently degrades truthfulness across all scales. Importantly, distortion-free watermarking methods (Gumbel) show consistently better preservation of truthfulness. Conversely, distortion-based methods (KGW) consistently impose heavier penalty on truthfulness. 28 Published at the 1st workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025 Figure 27: Change in unsafe responses and overrefusal counts across model scales under KGW (Distort) and Gumbel (Dist-Free) watermarking.
