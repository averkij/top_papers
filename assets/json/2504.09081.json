            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in integrating speech and audio capabilities into large language models (LLMs). common approach involves coupling an audio encoder with an LLM by projecting audio embeddings into the models input space (Tang et al.; Yang et al., 2024a; Gong et al., 2023b; Das et al., 2024). This integration preserves rich prosodic and acoustic information beyond textual transcriptions, enabling speechtext LLMs to perform broad range of speech understanding tasks. Another research direction focuses on extending LLM vocabulary to generate discrete audio tokens for speech synthesis (Rubenstein et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023). Speech-text LLMs are typically trained on existing task-specific speech corpora, which are primarily designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR). These datasets predominantly consist of paired audio and task-specific labels rather than natural language instructions, limiting their utility for instruction-following training. This lack of diverse, large-scale instruction datasets poses challenges in generalizing to broader speech understanding tasks. To address this gap, we introduce SIFT-50M1 (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), large-scale multilingual dataset covering five languages for instruction-based speech model training. SIFT-50M augments existing speech datasets with instruction-based question-answer (QA) pairs for speech understanding and includes approximately 5M examples for controllable speech generation. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: (1) We release SIFT-50M, 50M-example multilingual instruction dataset which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest publicly available instruction dataset for speech understanding tasks. (2) We introduce EvalSIFT, benchmark dataset designed for systematically evaluating speech-text LLMs across multiple dimensions. (3) We develop SIFT-LLM, speech-text LLM trained on SIFT-50M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on instruction-following benchmarks compared to publicly available models of similar size. (4) We conduct controllable speech generation experiments using SIFT-50M, demonstrating the models ability to generate speech in instructed styles."

            "content": "Speech-text LLMs: Several speech-text LLMs have been introduced recently. Early works focused on specific tasks such as ASR (Fathullah et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024) and second-pass ASR rescoring (Li et al., 2023b). SALMONN (Tang et al.) integrates Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) and BEATs (Chen et al., 2023) encoders with pre-trained LLM using window-level Q-former *Equal contribution.

Qwen-Audio (Chu et al., 2023) and Qwen2-Audio (Chu et al., 2024) are trained on over 30 speech, audio, and music tasks. WavLLM (Hu et al., 2024) incorporates two speech encoders, Whisper-large-v2 and WavLM-base (Chen et al., 2022), while LTU-AS (Gong et al., 2023b) integrates Whisper-large with Llama-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) via time and layerwise transformer (Gong et al., 2023a). These models process continuous audio representations, projecting encoded audio into the LLMs input space. To support both understanding and generation, AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023) and LauraGPT (Du et al., 2023) extend LLM vocabulary with discrete audio tokens. AudioPaLM discretizes embeddings from USM (Zhang et al., 2023) and w2v-BERT (Chung et al., 2021) using kmeans clustering, extending LLM vocabulary with discrete audio tokens. LauraGPT adopts hybrid approach, utilizing conformer-based encoder for continuous representation of input speech while generating discrete EnCodec (DÃ©fossez et al., 2022) codes for output speech. Instruction Fine-Tuning Datasets: Most prior speech-text LLMs rely on task-specific datasets with instructions generated by LLMs. To improve task diversity, WavLLM (Hu et al., 2024) created 3K-hour speech question-answering dataset using GPT-4 based on transcriptions from Librispeech (Panayotov et al., 2015), the AMI Meeting Corpus (Carletta et al., 2005), Fisher (Cieri et al.), and Switchboard (Godfrey et al., 1992). Additionally, they developed multi-task dataset by merging independent training examples into single multitask instructions. Another relevant dataset is OpenASQA (Gong et al., 2023b), publicly available instruction finetuning dataset with 2.7M examples for speech and audio tasks. Its construction methodology, closely related to ours, leverages datasets such as IEMOCAP (Busso et al., 2008), LibriTTS (Zen et al., 2019), VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al., 2018), and MOSEI (Zadeh et al., 2018). OpenASQA augments existing annotations (e.g., transcription, emotion, gender) with metadata such as speed, pitch, and energy, and then uses this enriched metadata to prompt GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate QA pairs. In contrast, SIFT-50M is an order of magnitude larger than OpenASQA, covering broader range of speech dimensions (e.g., accent, age, gender, pitch, speaking rate, word alignment, room characteristics, noise level, distortion) while also supporting instructions in four additional languages beyond English. Controllable Speech Generation: Promptbased speech generation, enabling controllable synthesis of acoustic characteristics such as gender, speaking rate, pitch, and loudness, has become prominent area of investigation (Guo et al., 2023; Shimizu et al., 2024). (Kawamura et al., 2024) annotated the LibriTTS corpus (Zen et al., 2019) with textual prompts to augment these specific speech properties. While (Lyth and King, 2024) detailed method for annotating substantial 45K-hour corpus for high-fidelity speech generation, these prompts are not publicly available, limiting reproducibility and benchmarking. Conversely, SIFT50M offers speech generation instructions across five languages, enabling control over broader spectrum of parameters, including gender, accent, age, speaking rate, pitch, and intensity."

These sources provide diverse range of speakers, speech styles, languages, and accents. We augment the existing metadata with additional features extracted from the speech data and generate natural language instructions from the enriched metadata with the help of an LLM. Finally, we employ feedback loop involving verification and iterative prompt refinement to improve the generation process."

            "content": "We augment the source speech datasetswhich typically include content-level characteristics, with additional acoustic-level features such as pitch, speaking rate, intensity, duration, reverberation, and noise level. We extract pitch using PYYAPT (Kasi and Zahorian, 2002) and intensity (in decibels) using Parselmouth (Jadoul et al., 2018). Phonemes are derived from transcripts via grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model (Park, 2019), while noise, speech quality, and reverberation features are computed following the method described in (Lacombe, 2024). Content-level attributes (e.g., transcription, gender, age, and accent) are provided in the source datasets, although accent and age information is available only for random subset of utterances in the Common Voice and VCTK 2 Figure 1: Block diagram showing the stages of SIFT-50M dataset construction. For non-English data generation, we substitute the metadata mapping with the respective language and prompt the LLM to generate responses in that language. datasets. When gender label is missing, we employ gender classification model (Huh, 2024) to fill in the gap. We then convert numerical utterance-level statistics into categorical ranges for pitch, intensity, age, reverberation, noise level, and speech quality based on the distribution of each variable within dataset. For example, pitch is binned separately for male and female speakers due to their different typical ranges. Specifically, for male speaker, an average pitch metadata is mapped to slightly low pitch when the median pitch falls within 125 < fmedian < 138 Hz, while for female speaker the corresponding range is 166 < fmedian < 182 Hz. Age is similarly grouped into broad categories (e.g., twenties, thirties, . . . , nineties) to both de-identify and generalize the attribute. For detailed list of categorical values, please refer to Appendix Section B.1. To generate word-level metadata, we extract time alignments for each word using our in-house hybrid HMM-LSTM acoustic model (Sak, 2014) for forced alignment. The start and end times of each word are then used to derive word-level pitch and intensity statistics, which are subsequently converted to categorical values. For non-English languages (French, German, Spanish, and Italian), we map the metadata characteristics and their corresponding categorical values to the target language using phrase-level translation dictionary."

            "content": "Our instructions are organized into three main categories: closed-ended, open-ended, and controllable generation. To generate instruction-response pairs, we feed categorical metadata to the LLM and prompt it to produce up to 10 QA pairs per speech utterance, as shown in Figure 1. For multilingual instruction generation, the LLM is prompted to generate instructions in the specified language using the corresponding mapped metadata. Table 1 provides examples of QA pairs for different categories in the SIFT-50M dataset. High-level statistics of SIFT-50M are presented in Table 2. Closed-ended Instructions: These instructions are subdivided into four sub-categories: (1) Acoustic-Level, (2) Content-Level, (3) Word-Align, and (4) Comparison types. The first three subcategories, generated using Mixtral 8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024), are based on the respective metadata types. As reported in LTU (Gong et al., 2023c), closed-ended instructions are crucial for guiding the model to understand speech and follow instructions without hallucinating. Unlike LTUs OpenASQA data, which relies on pre-processed questions and strict answer templates, our approach leverages careful prompt engineering to allow the 3 Closed-ended: Acoustic-Level Question: How would you characterize the speaking rate in this audio? Answer: The speaking rate in this audio is slightly slow. Closed-ended: Word-Align Question: What is the average pitch for the word bent and how does it compare to the average pitch of the surrounding words? Answer: The average pitch for the word bent is quite low. The previous word upon has similar average pitch, while the following word upon has slightly lower pitch. Overall, there is not significant change in pitch for these words. Closed-ended: Comparison Question: Which audio has speaker with Scottish accent? Answer: The second audio has speaker with Scottish accent, whereas the first audio has speaker with an English accent. Open-ended Question: Analyze the phonetic structure of the audio and discuss how the phonemes contribute to the overall perception of the speakers accent and age category. Answer: The phonetic structure, including phonemes like IH1, T, S, IY1, M, , AH0, W, EY1, S, T, AH1, V, T, AE1, L, AH0, N, T, S, reflects an Irish accent characterized by distinct vowel sounds and consonant clusters. The precise articulation and the youthful intonation patterns suggest the speaker is in their twenties. Controllable Generation Question: Please synthesize speech sample with very low pitch and quite monotone pitch variation, spoken quite slowly and at moderate volume. The speaker should be an adult woman in her fifties with United States English accent. Given the transcription text as: In my book of memory, time writes tales of moments past.

This approach encourages the model to produce thoughtful and detailed responses. We employ Amazon Nova Pro to generate open-ended dataset. Controllable Generation: This category includes instructions for expressive speech synthesis from text with specific speech characteristics. These instructions are generated using Mixtral 8x7B based on the provided acoustic and content-level metadata. EvalSIFT: We also release benchmark, EvalSIFT, constructed in manner similar to SIFT-50M. For each of the five languages, we generate 2K examples per category (closed-ended, open-ended, and controllable generation), yielding total of 30K examples.

In addition, language field is incorporated into the metadata (by sampling examples from the top-20 locales in the Common Voice dataset) to facilitate the generation of instructions for the acoustic-based language identification (LID) task. We introduce novel task in the form of Comparison instructions, where the LLM compares two audio files based on their speech characteristics. The LLM is provided with metadata from two distinct audio files and is prompted to generate comparative questions and free-form answers rather than binary responses. Due to the increased complexity of this task, we employ Amazon Nova Pro (Intelligence, 2024), which has demonstrated stronger performance on text benchmarks compared to Mixtral 8x7B. Open-ended Instructions: In this category, the LLM is prompted to generate more complex and During the metadata extraction stage, we reject any values that fall outside the feasible ranges for the respective speech characteristics, ensuring accurate mapping from numerical to categorical values. High-quality, well-crafted LLM-generated data is essential for efficient model fine-tuning and improving the models ability to follow unseen instructions. We employ two types of quality control over the LLM-generated datasets. First, the authors perform an exhaustive review of the LLM responses across all categories and languages. We establish feedback loop with iterative prompt refinement to ensure that the models responses are cogent, meet our expectations, and are free from hallucinations. Second, we conduct ablation studies on the generated data by evaluating performance on the SIFT-50M development sets, which allows us to identify and discard problematic data or even entire categories. For example, we found that instructions based on speech-text alignment that include numer4 ical values (e.g., What words occur between the 3 and 5 second mark?) significantly degraded model performance. Consequently, we retain only instructions with non-numerical values (i.e., instructions similar to the word-align category shown in Table 1). We release the rejected portion as bonus research partition to support future research directions."

Specifically, we use Whisper-medium (Radford et al., 2023) as the encoder to process input audio. To produce discretized speech tokens, we apply k-means clustering on HuBERT embeddings (Lakhotia et al., 2021), which primarily capture the semantic content of the speech. These discrete tokens are subsequently converted to audio using vocoder based on the Big-VGan architecture (Lee et al., 2023). Large Language Model: Our core LLM is Qwen2.5-7B-instruct (Yang et al., 2024a). We add linear layer on top of the Whisper-medium encoder to project the 1024-dimensional speech embeddings into the LLMs 3584-dimensional space. Additionally, we expand the LLMs vocabulary by including 2000 k-means clustered HuBERT speech tokens. We employ low-rank adaptation (Hu et al., 2021) to train the LLM parameters."

This phase involves training on mixture of speech understanding and generation tasksnamely, ASR, emotion recognition (ER), speaker-attributed ASR (SA-ASR), intent classification (IC), slot entity recognition (SER), speechto-text translation (S2TT), speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), and text-to-speech (TTS). We convert the IC task into multiple-choice question format by providing possible intent values in the instructions. All tasks are represented using natural language instructions. In addition to SIFT-50M, we also release the prompt templates used during this stage. During pre-training, the acoustic encoder remains frozen, and we train only the linear connector layer and the LoRA parameters of the LLM. We set the LoRA rank to 16, resulting in 8.7M learnable parameters, and train for total of 200K steps. The resulting pre-trained models are referred to as SIFT-LLM PT. For controllable generation experiments, we continue pre-training for an additional 200K steps, using LoRA rank of 128 and making the core LLMs embedding layer fully trainable. In this stage, the total number of learnable parameters is 590M, and we increase the weights of the TTS and S2ST datasets. Instruction Fine-tuning: Following continued pre-training, we perform an instruction finetuning stage using the SIFT-50M dataset. We conduct separate fine-tuning processes for speech understanding and controllable generation. For speech understanding, training is initialized from the 50Kth SIFT-LLM PT checkpoint and uses only the speech understanding instructions (closedand open-ended) from SIFT-50M. The number of trainable parameters remains the same as during pretraining for the first 200K steps. We refer to this model as SIFT-LLM. For controllable generation, training is initialized from the 400Kth SIFT-LLM PT checkpoint and focuses exclusively on controllable generation instructions, with the number of trainable parameters unchanged from the last 200K steps of pre-training. This model is referred to as SIFT-LLM GEN. For further details on training datasets, prompts, and setup, we refer the reader to Appendix D."

AIR-Bench (Yang et al., 2024b) is composed of two parts: Foundation, which covers 19 standard speech tasks, and Chat, which includes open-ended questions. We use Dynamic-Superb (DS-1)2 for closed-ended evaluations, and the Chat partition of AIR-Bench for open-ended evaluation, selecting only the speech subset (excluding sound and music). Additionally, we report metrics on both the closedand open-ended categories of EvalSIFT. SIFT-LLM and O-ASQA-LLM accept any number of text and audio segments in all possible permutations, whereas Qwen2-Audio-Instruct and SALMONN-7B accept only single audio input. To address this limitation during evaluation for comparison tasks in EvalSIFT or for tasks in Dynamic-Superb that involve multiple audio segments, we concatenate the segments with 1second silence between each. Metrics: While exact match accuracy is common metric for closed-ended or classification tasks, it becomes less reliable for speech-text LLMs, which tend to produce verbose, open-ended responses. Therefore, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge strategy (Zheng et al., 2023) similar to that used in DS-1 and AIR-Bench, employing Claude-3.5Sonnet3 for evaluation. Using chain-of-thought 2Phase-2 data was not available at the time of writing. 3https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/ 6 reasoning prompt (Wei et al., 2022), we provide Claude-3.5-Sonnet with both the question and the reference answer. For closed-ended and classification benchmarks, we prompt it to classify responses as correct or incorrect, while for open-ended benchmarks, we ask it to score the responses on scale from 0 to 10 based on their alignment with the reference answer. We repeated LLM scoring multiple times and found that the width of 95% confidence interval for the mean accuracy (in %) was less than 0.1 and for the mean score was less than 0.01. Results: Table 3 summarizes the performance of various models on instruction-following benchmarks. SIFT-LLM achieves competitive results across all benchmarks and outperforms all other models. Notably, it performs better than O-ASQALLM on every benchmark, underscoring the importance of the large-scale and diverse SIFT-50M dataset. Furthermore, SIFT-LLM is second-best on the Audio task in the Dynamic-Superb benchmark, despite not being explicitly trained on audio tasks. We observed that the performance gap between SIFT-LLM and other models is less for Contentlevel instructions in EvalSIFT, but significantly larger for Acoustic-level, Word-Align, and Comparison type instructions, highlighting the value of data addressing these dimensions in the SIFT50M dataset. Finally, the model shows signs of reasoning abilities, as evidenced by the examples in Appendix H, where SIFT-LLM reasons through open-ended questions before arriving at its conclusions. Results on non-English languages: Since both Dynamic-Superb and AIR-Bench Chat benchmarks provide instructions exclusively in English, we use EvalSIFT for multilingual evaluation. The results are reported in Table 5. SIFT-LLM outperforms SALMONN-7B and Qwen2-Audio-Instruct on closed-ended evaluations across languages. However, Qwen2-Audio-Instruct remains competitive on open-ended evaluations, as observed with English data as well. Overall, absolute accuracy is lower on non-English languages compared to English.

Bold values indicate the best results. performance can be sensitive to the prompts used (Wang et al., 2024), we use the prompts recommended by the corresponding model wherever possible. For ER, IC, and SER tasks, we leverage Claude-3.5-Sonnet to classify responses as correct or incorrect, ensuring robustness against modelspecific output formats. Sequence generation tasks, such as ASR and S2TT pose additional challenges due to some models producing extra text; to address this, we use regular expressions and Claude-3.5Sonnet to parse model hypotheses. Furthermore, we apply Whisper text normalization4 before computing WER. The results, presented in Table 4, reveal that no single model excels across all tasks. While SALMONN-7B achieves the best performance on ASR benchmarks for English, Qwen2-AudioInstruct outperforms the others on S2TT, and SIFTLLM significantly outperforms on ER and spoken language understanding tasks. On the multilingual ASR task, SIFT-LLM and Qwen2-Audio-Instruct show significantly better results than SALMONN7B and O-ASQA-LLM. Compared to the pretrained model from which SIFT-LLM is initialized (the 50Kth checkpoint), SIFT-LLM shows slight decline in performance across tasksan observation consistent with findings for Qwen2-Audio and its instruction fine-tuned variant (Wang et al., 2024). Furthermore, performance differences between the 50K and 200K pre-trained checkpoints are minimal across all tasks."

We report two metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). The distance-based metrics are computed on values categorized into ordinal groupsfor example, speaking rate is scored on scale ranging from very slowly (0) to very fast (6). We focus on stationary characteristics such as pitch variation, speaking rate, and intensity to avoid bias from the reference speaker used during vocoder generation. We set the sampling temperature to 0.8 during the inference to balance diversity and coherence in generation. The results, presented in Table 6, show that the MAE value for each category is less than 1, indicating that, on average, predictions deviate from the true category by less than one step. It is important to note that the speech characteristics of the generated waveform are influenced both by the non-semantic information preserved in the speech codes (HuBERT codes, in this case) and the reference speaker signal used in the vocoder, if any. Additional details on the impact of the reference speaker are provided in Appendix F.3."

            "content": "For ablation studies, the default SIFT-LLM configuration employs LoRA rank of 8 and is trained exclusively on the English subset of SIFT-50M during instruction fine-tuning. The remainder of the setup is identical to that described in Section 4.2. Factors Influencing Instruction-Following: Table 7 summarizes the key factors impacting the models instruction-following abilities. Extended pre-training can cause the core LLM to lose some of its instruction-following capability. While eliminating pre-training leads to only moderate degradation on instruction-following benchmarks, it results in significant decline in performance on foundational tasks like ASR and S2TT. Increasing the LoRA rank from 8 to 16 yields mixed results, DS-1 EvalSIFT (Closed) EvalSIFT (Open) Default Init. from 200K ckpt No Pre-training LoRA rank=16 LoRA rank=32 No open-ended data No word-align data No comparison data 57.3 52.5 56.7 58.4 55.7 54.3 57.1 56. 45.4 42.3 43.7 45.1 43.9 42.2 41.5 34.3 8.0 7.7 7.9 8.0 7.8 6.1 8.0 7.3 Table 7: Evaluation results on DS-1 and EvalSIFT (English) for various training setups.

Figure 2: Effect of SIFT data volume used during instruction fine-tuning on SIFT-LLMs performance, as measured on DS-1, AIR-Bench Chat, and EvalSIFT. but raising it further to 32 results in degradation. Training exclusively on closed-ended datasets significantly impairs open-ended performance, and it also negatively affects accuracy on the closedended set. Additionally, omitting comparison data leads to marked drop in performance on closedended EvalSIFT, especially for comparison instructions, since comparison data is the only subset of EvalSIFT that involves multiple audio inputs. Effect of Data Volume: To assess the impact of data volume during instruction fine-tuning, we trained SIFT-LLM using varying fractions of the SIFT-50M dataset: half, one-quarter, and oneeighth of the total volume. The evaluation results, shown in Figure 2, indicate that even with just one-eighth of the data, the model achieves strong performance on open-ended benchmarks. However, increasing the data volume leads to further improvements on closed-ended instructions."

            "content": "In this work, we introduce SIFT-50M, large-scale multilingual dataset designed for instruction finetuning of speech-text LLMs. By integrating diverse set of instructions spanning various speech understanding tasks, SIFT-50M not only facilitates instruction-following but also helps models generalize better to unseen instructions. Our experimental results show that SIFT-LLM, our model trained on SIFT-50M, achieves strong performance on instruction-following benchmarks and competitive results on foundational speech understanding tasks. Moreover, we present EvalSIFT, benchmark dataset tailored for the systematic evaluation of speech-text LLMs for both speech understanding and controllable generation."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "While SIFT-LLM demonstrates strong performance on instruction-following benchmarks, it does not achieve state-of-the-art results on foundational speech tasks. Future work could explore the tradeoff between enhancing instruction-following generalization and maintaining competitive performance on foundational tasks relative to task-specific models. Additionally, SIFT-LLM occasionally generates hallucinated responses when queried about content unrelated to the input audio. To mitigate this, we generated additional instruction data by prompting the LLM to produce questions unrelated to the audio along with appropriate answers. However, assigning higher weight to this auxiliary dataset during training resulted in reduced speech understanding capability. As LLMs continue to improve, the LLM-as-a-judge approach has become increasingly common for subjective evaluations. However, the reported metrics can vary depending on the LLM used. We observed that the variation was significantly low when running evaluations multiple times with the same LLM. Furthermore, speech-text LLMs have been found to be sensitive to the prompts used for evaluating foundational tasks such as ASR and S2TT. Although we made every effort to use the prompts recommended by each respective model, the necessary information was not available for some tasks or was provided only for the pre-trained variants."

We refer to the resulting audio as re-synthesized audio. In this experiment, we used randomly selected reference speaker signal in the vocoder. Using the same metrics as in Table 6, we compared the speech characteristics of the re-synthesized audio with those of the original audio. Ideally, the re-synthesized audio should match the characteristics of the original audio. However, the results, shown in Table 18, indicate that while speaking rate exhibited some similarity, other characteristics differed considerably. In further experiment, we assessed the effect of the reference speaker signal used in the vocoder. First, we selected original audio samples from the source speech corpus, whose metadata was used to construct given controllable generation instruction. We then compared two outputs: (1) the audio re-synthesized from HuBERT tokens extracted from the original audio, and (2) the audio generated by SIFT-LLM GEN for the corresponding instruction. For each example, the same reference speaker signal was used in the vocoder. The results, reported in Table 19, show that pitch variation and intensity exhibit much stronger correlation when the same reference speaker is used. We also observed that gender predictions 19 matched approximately 96% between the SIFT-LLM GEN generated audio and the re-synthesized audio, whereas the match was only around 50% when compared against the gender specified in the controllable instruction. We hypothesize this limitation is due to incomplete representation of speech in HuBERT codesi.e, they primarily capture semantic content and limited stationary aspects such as speaking rate, pitch, and intensity.

Examples of SIFT-LLMs reasoning abilities Question 1: What might be the possible scenario in which this speech was delivered? (Audio: We want to continue to be on the periphery of the European infrastructure system, besides the sins of our people.) Reference Answer: One possible scenario in which this speech could have been delivered is during conference or meeting where the speaker is discussing their organizations stance on the European infrastructure system. Model Response: Given the formal tone, international accent, and specific vocabulary related to infrastructure and Europe, this speech could have been delivered in an academic or professional setting, possibly at conference or seminar. Question 2: What is the speakers concern in the speech? (Audio: How do strengthen it all in acceptable form that can be done in two or two and half hours?) Reference Answer: The speakers concern is to figure out way to achieve the task within the given time frame. Model Response: The speaker is concerned about the effort and time required to achieve certain form or appearance. Specifically, they are questioning how someone could accomplish this in two or two-and-a-half hours. 21 Question 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the audio for use in professional setting and propose modifications to enhance its suitability. Reference Answer: The audio is ineffective for professional setting due to its poor speech quality and slow delivery. Modifications such as re-recording with better equipment, increasing speaking rate, and reducing background noise would enhance its suitability. Model Response: The audio is not suitable for professional setting due to its very bad speech quality, noisy background, and distant-sounding reverberation. To enhance its suitability, the speaker should record in quiet environment with minimal background noise. Using high-quality microphone and ensuring proper distance from the microphone can reduce reverberations. Additionally, post-production editing could be used to clean up the audio and improve clarity."
