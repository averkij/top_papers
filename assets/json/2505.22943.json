            "content": "Recent advances in multimodal systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating multimodal content from multimodal inputs. At the core of these developments lies pre-trained multimodal representations, which can encode rich information from different modalities. Such representations, notably illustrated by Contrastive Image-Language Pre-Training (CLIP) (Radford et al., 2021), has become an indispensable component in modeling complex contextual understanding in crossmodal settings, finding widespread applications across retrieval (Luo et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2023), generation (Ramesh et al., 2022), and reward modeling (Yu et al., 2023a; Rocamonde Equal Contribution Figure 1: Key idea of Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC). MAC benchmarks compositional vulnerabilities of pre-trained multimodal representation (e.g., CLIP, LanguageBind) with comprehensive set of criteria. CLIP(, ) denotes the cosine similarity between image and text embeddings from CLIP. et al., 2024). Moreover, its usage has become commonplace across various modalities beyond imagelanguage pairs. Contrary to their prevalence in wide range of downstream applications, pre-trained multimodal representations are known to be considerably brittle. This brittleness can be intuitively exemplified by compounding text elements. As illustrated in Fig. 1-(b), with an image of baby sitting, these systems may assign high similarity score to an erroneous description like bed is sitting on baby than the correct description. Such counterintuitive judgments occur surprisingly often, implying critical issue where the vulnerabilities in the embeddings are inherited by the models that utilize them. Consequently, there have been active efforts to identify these weaknesses through negative samples constructed from the perspective of visual compositional reasoning (i.e., structured relationship between words and their corresponding visual elements), such as negation, event swapping, and attribute replacement (Thrush et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023). However, developing comprehensive understanding of diverse compositional vulnerabilities, without assuming specific scenarios, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce the challenge of large language models (LLMs) deceiving CLIP, i.e., exploiting weaknesses in how pre-trained multimodal representations encode relationships between objects and attributes in multimodal contents (e.g., image). To this end, we propose to benchmark the Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC) of target representation. Given multimodal data pairs (e.g., image-caption), LLMs generate deceptive captions by slightly modifying ground-truth captions in way that misaligns or contradicts the original content. We then rigorously evaluate whether the target representation mistakenly prefers these generated captions over the original ones. Unlike previous studies that address compositionality within specific modalities (Thrush et al., 2022; Bansal et al., 2024; Ghosh et al., 2024), our work highlights key distinction in deceiving target representation in modality-agnostic manner (e.g., image, video, audio). For evaluation, given set of captions generated by LLMs for deceiving, we propose testbed that assesses their effectiveness through samplewise and group-wise evaluation. We first evaluate whether each generated sample successfully executes an attack (sample-wise). This success requires meeting multifaceted conditions: the generated deceptive sample should (i) maintain high crossmodal similarity with the original multimodal input, (ii) contain non-entailing content while (iii) maintaining lexical similarity to the original text, and (iv) adhere to prescribed instructions without relying on shortcuts. Furthermore, if they are predictable or monotonous, they become easily defensible and fail to unravel diverse compositional vulnerabilities. Therefore, we design entropy-based metrics to measure the diversity of composition elements used in deception across the set of generated samples (group-wise). In addition, we leverage the self-training of LLMs (Huang et al., 2023), particularly rejection sampling fine-tuning (Touvron et al., 2023) for the first time, where generated samples are used for additional training to promote deceptive response generation. Existing zero-shot sample generation for compositionality and naïve self-training methods often fail to elicit diverse compositions using limited set of elements. To address this limitation, we propose diversity-promoting self-training approach by thorough sampling among sample candidates. Even with smaller LLMs centered around Llama-3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024), our simple yet effective framework can substantially improve both attack success rates and diversity. We achieve superior deception performance compared to prior work across various representations for multiple modalities, including image, video, and audio. In particular, our method outperforms existing approaches (Yarom et al., 2023; Momeni et al., 2023; Ghosh et al., 2024), when evaluated on COCO (Lin et al., 2014), MSRVTT (Xu et al., 2016), and AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019), successfully deceiving target models, notably CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and LanguageBind (Zhu et al., 2024)."

            "content": "Multimodal Compositional Reasoning. Often studied in the vision-language domain, it refers to the structured relationship between words and their corresponding visual elements (Thrush et al., It serves as key indicator of whether 2022). models truly understand multimodal contexts, impacting critical tasks such as negative sample mining (Shekhar et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2022; Yuksekgonul et al., 2022) and hallucination mitigation (Li et al., 2023b). To evaluate compositional reasoning, multiple benchmarks have been introduced to focus on robustness (Park et al., 2024), systematicity (Ma et al., 2023), and cross-domain alignment (Yarom et al., 2023). Another line of work enhances compositional reasoning by curating training data (Doveh et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b; Patel et al., 2024) and regularizing learning objectives (Oh et al., 2024). Recent efforts have expanded beyond image-text interactions to explore and improve compositionality in video-language (Liu et al., 2020; Park et al., 2022; Momeni et al., 2023; Bansal et al., 2024) and audio-language contexts (Ghosh et al., 2024). Most closely related to our work is SugarCrepe (Hsieh et al., 2023), which addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by filtering nonsensical and non-fluent text to avoid trivial solutions. NaturalBench (Li et al., 2024a) focuses on generating challenging visual QA pairs easy for humans but difficult for models.

(2024) uses claim manipulator model to contradict these modalities, our work highlights key distinction by grounding the contradiction and diversity in quantifiable measure of deceiving the target multimodal representation. Moreover, we extend our filtering criteria to better generate such samples in terms of diversity and successful deception via self-training. Multimodal Adversarial Attack on Text. Adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al., 2014) manipulate input data to perturb models embedding space or induce incorrect predictions, systematically revealing vulnerabilities. In continuous domains like images, attacks typically inject subtle noise to mislead inference or maliciously control model behavior (Dong et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019; Shayegani et al., 2023a). In discrete domains like text, common strategies include identifying and replacing vulnerable words (Li et al., 2020), gradient-based attacks with Gumbel-softmax (Guo et al., 2021), masked token perturbations (Li et al., 2021), and LLM-based refinement (Mehrotra et al., 2024). Text-based adversarial attacks can be extended to multimodal data, particularly targeting retrieval performance in image-text pairs by combining image noise injection and text perturbation. For instance, Co-Attack (Zhang et al., 2022) applies multimodal distribution-aware collaborative perturbations to image-text pairs while maintaining crossmodal consistency. Other methods enhance attack transferability via crossmodal guidance (Lu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024) or iterative search-based black-box attacks (Yin et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023b). Recent studies have expanded attacks to video (Yang et al., 2024b) or audio (Bagdasaryan et al., 2024) beyond image-text pairs. However, these approaches focus on embedding perturbations, often resulting in either simple paraphrasing or unnatural text modifications without considering their entailment with the original text. To address these limitations, we instead apply compositionality-aware modification that enables embedding-level perturbations while maintaining naturalness and semantic plausibility."

            "content": "3.1 Problem Definition Our Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality benchmark (MAC) is illustrated in Fig. 2. Given target pre-trained multimodal representation that we want to deceive (e.g., CLIP), MAC evaluates how effectively we can expose compositional vulnerabilities by updating text elements in multimodal data pairs. We use text updates as an anchor since it allows for modality-agnostic assessment and is more intuitively aligned with human interpretation than noise injection (Szegedy et al., 2014). Given set of paired data = (ti, xi)MD i=1 , Figure 2: Overview of (a) multimodal adversarial compositionality and (b) diversity-promoting self-training. where ti represents text and xi represents paired input modality (e.g., images), we aim to generate set of adversarial text {ti}MD i=1 that effectively exploit the compositional vulnerabilities of target pre-trained multimodal representation denoted by , which encodes both ti and xi into embeddings yti, yxi = (ti, xi) Rd. The generation of adversarial text {ti}MD i=1 comprises two key components: (1) an adversarial sample generator that produces up to adversarial text samples {tn n=1 under specified budget constraint, and (2) sample filterer that identifies the most effective adversarial text sample ti from the candidates based on their potential to deceive the pre-trained model . }N Defining the multimodal compositionality problem as MAC offers several advantages. First, since MAC does not assume specific type of modality, it can be seamlessly applied to various formats including image, video, and audio. Second, previous compositionality frameworks that utilize rule-based or LLM-based generators for text updates, as well as our self-training-based generators (Sec. 4) can be consistently compared under our testbed to determine which framework more effectively deceives the target representation. 3.2 Sample-wise Deception Evaluation Crossmodal Criterion. First and foremost, the generated sample should achieve the intended attack. The criterion is to deceive the target model such that the model determines the generated adversarial sample is more closely aligned with the input modality than the original text. For an i-th data pair (ti, xi) and generated sample ti, crossmodal attack success is sc = I(dθ(yti, yxi) < dθ(yti , yxi)), (1) where is an indicator function, and dθ is an embedding distance, where we use cosine similarity. For , yxi) instance, in Fig. 1-(c), dθ(yti, yxi) and dθ(yti are 0.34 and 0.37, respectively, indicating successful attack on CLIP. Unimodal Criterion. While the crossmodal distance is well-established measure, this criterion alone may lead to results that merely amount to paraphrasing, as demonstrated in various adversarial attack scenarios (Zhang et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023). To prevent this, another crucial criterion is that there should be meaningful semantic distinction between the generated sample and the original text. Unimodal attack success for the i-th data pair is defined as follows: su = ΠjI(lj(ti, ti) < τ ), (2) where τ is threshold for similarity and lj indicates an unimodal text model to measure entailment between two text samples (Yarom et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023). We use the agreement of multiple off-the-shelf NLI models (Liu et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). We use τ = 0.5, following Bansal et al. (2024). In Fig. 1-(c), all NLI models assess that the generated caption accidentally typing an email does not entail reaching for the keys, indicating successful unimodal attack. Note that we perform preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 on 1K samples to verify the robustness of su , showing concordance rate of over 93% with GPT-4. Distance Criterion. Model-based evaluation of unimodal gap effectively reflects the differences between embeddings; however, it may unfairly favor irrelevant text samples, which goes against the purpose of deceiving the original pair. Therefore, the generated sample should execute attack with only limited lexical deviation from the original sample: sd = I(dE(ti, ti) < LD/2), (3) where dE is the Levenshtein distance between original and generated samples (Ostrovsky and Rabani, 2007; Andoni and Nosatzki, 2020) and LD is the average token length of dataset for providing dataset-specific limits in updates. In Fig. 1-(c), dE(ti, ti) = 4 is less than LD/2 5.21, satisfying the distance criterion. Auxiliary Criterion. Lastly, we evaluate whether generated sample follows set of predefined rules. For instance, as utilized by several frameworks in Table 1, if generation should be performed through specific operations (e.g., swap), failing to comply with this cannot be considered successful deception. Similarly, if trivial solutions are used, e.g., negation (Ma et al., 2023), it is desirable for these to be filtered out as well. The auxiliary attack success of i-th pair sa evaluates to true if it satisfies all predefined constraints (e.g., prompt) through rulebased lexical validation. In Fig. 1-(b), the generated sample follows the swap operation by exchanging only two nouns (baby and bed) without additional modifications. In total, the attack success rate is = 1 MD (cid:88) (sc su sd sa ). (4) Although these elements have been partially highlighted in previous research, our key contribution lies in bringing them together to quantify the attack effectiveness. It enables consistent comparison across frameworks for revealing compositional vulnerabilities. 3.3 Group-wise Diversity Evaluation Another crucial criterion for successfully exposing compositional vulnerability is the diversity of generated samples. While repeatedly employing similar and simple attack patterns might boost immediate attack success rates, such approaches are easily defensible and lack generalizability. Indeed, when samples are generated without considering diversity, the attack becomes overly focused on specific distributional weaknesses of the representation, resulting in frequently utilizing limited set of vocabulary (e.g., man, woman, and vintage in Fig. 8 in Appendix B.3). Therefore, thorough analysis of pre-trained multimodal representations compositional vulnerabilities necessitates the construction and utilization of adversarial samples that encompass diverse patterns of text updates, which has largely been overlooked. j=1}MD To this end, we first construct set of attributeenriched tokens that represents transformation from ti to ti through series of insertion and deletion of words from the Levenshtein distance computation. The token ej is defined as OP_POS_LEMMA, where OP, POS, LEMMA corresponds to an wordlevel operation (insertion or deletion), part-ofspeech (POS) tag, and lemmatized word, respectively (e.g., I_NOUN_man). Such tokens distinguish which word-level operations or POS tags as well as words are involved when generating ti from ti. Using set of attribute-enriched tokens from all data pairs, i.e., {{ej }Ei i=1 , we compute probability distribution of unique tokens with respect to their frequency to obtain entropy = (cid:80) pj log pj, which indicates the extent to which the distribution is spread across different tokens. pj denotes the probability of j-th unique token and Ei is the number of tokens for an i-th sample. Note that higher implies more diverse set of lexical operations are involved when composing deceptive samples. To prevent pathological cases where the generator might produce arbitrary text to achieve high entropy values, we only consider samples that meet the edit distance criterion (Eq. 3) for diversity evaluation, discarding attribute-enriched tokens from samples that exceed this threshold. This ensures that our diversity metrics reflect meaningful variations in text transformations rather than random deviations from the ground truth. Since does not account for how many unique tokens are involved in generation, we also report two additional complementary measures. Following Li et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2021), distinct1 (D1) captures the ratio of unique tokens out of all tokens. On the other hand, the normalized entropy ˆH compromises and D1 by normalizing by the number of unique tokens. 3.4 Threat Model Categorization In nutshell, we can categorize the threat model of our framework by following the taxonomy established in adversarial learning (Zhang et al., 2020; Laidlaw et al., 2021; Schwinn et al., 2023; Shayegani et al., 2023b; Vassilev et al., 2024): Model knowledge - (i) Gray-box for crossmodal assessment (e.g., CLIP, LanguageBind); we use only output embeddings with respect to queries without accessing gradients and model parameters. (ii) Black-box for unimodal assessment; we use entailment scores of off-the-shelf NLI models without other information. }N approachthat selects the best sample. Given samples {tn n=1, it prioritizes those that meet all sample-wise criteria in Sec. 3.2. If such samples exist, we randomly select from them; otherwise, we sample randomly from the entire set: Attack target - Untargeted; we induce incorrect predictions instead of eliciting specific responses. Attack granularity - Mix of word-level and sentence-level perturbation Perturbation constraint - Distance and auxiliary criteria (3.2) and diversity evaluation (3.3) for perceptually plausible attacks Evaluation - The sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise diversity evaluation Modality - Language + X, where can be image, video, and audio Budget - Number of sampling with LLM (N ), which will be further discussed (4)."

            "content": "4.1 Motivation Among diverse generators (e.g., rule-based, human-based, LLM-based) in Table 1, we prioritize LLM-based methods for the following reasons: (1) Rule-based methods (e.g., word swapping) often produce nonsensical and non-fluent text. Additionally, these methods tend to yield simplistic text focused on specific scenarios that models can easily defend against (Hsieh et al., 2023). (2) While human-generated annotations provide fluent text, they are difficult to scale due to resource constraints and the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process. (3) LLMs address these limitations by generating fluent text at scale. Thanks to these advantages, recent multimodal compositionality studies have increasingly adopted LLM-based methods instead of relying on rule-based or human-annotated methods. 4.2 Preliminary: Revealing Compositional Vulnerabilities via Filtering While attacks in vision-language compositionality literature typically occur only once (N = 1), leveraging multiple attempts (N > 1) with sample selection could be more effective in revealing such vulnerabilities (Shekhar et al., 2017; Yarom et al., 2023; Park et al., 2022). To incorporate sample selection into MAC, we adopt Best-ofN strategya widely used and general sampling Ti = {tn (cid:40) ti sd su (sc Uniform(Ti), Uniform({tn sa )(tn , ti, xi) = 1}, (5) if Ti = , n=1), otherwise. (6) }N As demonstrated in Table 2, while the filtering approach with > 1 shows improved performance compared to baseline methods, this approach faces several limitations. First, the computational cost scales linearly with when generating samples for each pair, and the time complexity increases significantly when performed sequentially (see Table 14 in Appendix B.2). Moreover, relying on larger masks the true effectiveness of adversarial strategies by enabling brute-force attempts. Thus, we limit to evaluate attack efficiency rather than persistence. 4.3 Self-training To address the limitations of filtering-based approaches, we propose learnable method designed to enhance the exposure of compositional vulnerabilities for the first time. Given the absence of annotations or ground truth, we employ selftraining (Huang et al., 2023) by promoting responses similar to the condition-satisfying samples generated by the base language model. This approach falls into the category of rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) (Touvron et al., 2023). From the training set Dtrain = (ti, xi) , we first generate and filter samples {ti} using Eq. 6, then only use ˆD successful adversarial samples to train the model using RFT loss: MDtrain i=1 MDtrain i=1 {ti} ˆD i=1 = (cid:110) ti sc su sd sa = 1 , (7) (cid:111) = 1 ˆD (cid:88) (cid:88) log g(ti,jti,<j, I, ti; Θ), (8) where denotes instruction prompt and Θ is set of learnable parameters of the generator g. As shown in Table 2, self-training significantly improves the attack success rate by learning to favor samples that effectively attack vulnerabilities with small (e.g., = 4). To further enhance attack performance beyond naïve self-training, one Algorithm 1 Diversity-promoting Self-training Data Selection Require: Set of samples {tn n=1 generated for each training instance [1, ˆD], and diversity function }N Ensure: Diverse successful samples {ti} ˆD i=1 randomly from {tn ˆD i=1 su (sc , ti, xi) = 1} Initialize {ti} )(tn sa sd for iteration = 1 to do for = 1 to ˆD do Ti {tn su sd ti argmaxtn Ti (sc end for )(tn sa H(t1, ..., tn , ti, xi) = 1} , ..., tM ˆD ) end for return {ti} ˆD i=1 can either train with larger (> 4) or iterate selftraining as needed. While self-training requires additional computational cost, it can be amortized during inference and leads to more efficient inference by reducing the number of attempts required to achieve high attack success rates. In our experiments, we set = 64 as the default value for large-N distilled self-training. 4.4 Diversity-promoting Self-training Although effective at generating successful attacks, self-training tends to generate monotonous samples focused on specific distributional weaknesses rather than maintaining sample diversity, resulting in decreased diversity. The selection of samples involved in training is therefore more important than the training process itself from the perspective of exposing compositional vulnerability. To enhance diversity while maintaining successful attacks, we introduce Gibbs sampling-based selection process described in Algorithm 1. This approach iteratively selects sample that maximize diversity among successful attacks. While we employ entropy as representative diversity metric, it can be substituted with any quantifiable diversity measure (e.g., D1)."

            "content": "5.1 Evaluation Protocol Target representation. We primarily use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and LanguageBind (LB) (Zhu et al., 2024) as target multimodal representations. They are representative models with dual-modality and multi-modality pre-training. Additionally, to analyze the transferability of deception across different representations, we also evaluate SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023), NegCLIP (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022), and BLIP (Li et al., 2022). Sample generation. Our methodology operates by modifying text (Sec. 3.1). We generate samples that reveal compositional vulnerability using representative multimodal datasets: COCO (Lin et al., 2014) for image, MSRVTT (Xu et al., 2016) for video, and AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019) for audio. Unless mentioned otherwise, we use Llama-3.18B (Dubey et al., 2024) for sample generation and self-training. We explore its applicability across different LLMs, including GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), noting that larger or proprietary models do not necessarily lead to more effective deception, as discussed in Appendix B.1. We employ two instruction prompts (i.e., in Eq. 8). The deceptive-general prompt instructs to expose vulnerability without constraints on text updates, while the deceptive-specific prompt instructs to perform text updates corresponding to replace, swap, and add based on taxonomy from existing literature, as in Table 1. See Appendix A.3 for prompt demonstrations. For better performance, we primarily use the general prompt. Evaluation metrics. We conduct sample-wise and group-wise evaluations as described in Sec. 3. For sample-wise evaluation, we report the attack success rate (ASR) focusing on crossmodal criterion (Cross) and all criteria (Total), while for group-wise diversity evaluation, we report entropy (H) and distinct-1 (D1). Fine-grained performance comparisons are discussed in Appendix B.4. Baselines. We establish set of competitive baselines using existing compositionality frameworks. For models generating with = 1 budget, we utilize RoCOCO (Park et al., 2024), SugarCrepe (Hsieh et al., 2023), LLaVa-Score (Li et al., 2024b), TripletClip (Patel et al., 2024), and VideoCon (Bansal et al., 2024). For filtering-based models, we employ SeeTrue (Yarom et al., 2023), VFC (Momeni et al., 2023), and CompA (Ghosh et al., 2024), using = 4 for inference.

Numbers in parentheses are absolute gains from our proposed self-training compared to the zero-shot baselines. two variants, there exists trade-off where maximizing ASR leads to sharp decline in diversity and vice versa, indicating that focusing on either metric alone is far from optimal. Generating multiple samples and applying filtering improves ASR across all modalities compared to = 1, though this does not translate to enhanced diversity. See Appendix B.3  (Fig. 8)  for qualitative distribution in terms of diversity. The last four rows reveal the ablation study of our method. Using only the deceptive-general prompt yields performance comparable to existing methods. Adding self-training for single iteration dramatically increases ASR, i.e., +68% on average, underscoring its role in addressing compositionality. Yet, this alone does not enhance diversity and may even reduce it. This implies naïve self-training, while effective for ASR, falls short in diverse exposure of compositional vulnerability. Instead, incorporating diversity-promoting filtering leads to consistent improvements in both diversity metrics without sacrificing ASR (+2%), advancing the pareto front in the attack-diversity trade-off. Table 3 examines the transferability of deceptive samples across multimodal representations. The results show high transferability, often exceeding the best performing baseline (23.33). Notably, the performance gains from self-training are substantial across all settings, achieving 2.1 improvement on average. BLIP shows slightly lower performance presumably due to its use of yes/no classification logits instead of embedding similarity. 5.3 Performance Analysis General vs. specific prompt. As summarized in Table 1, various compositionality frameworks employ either general or specific types of prompts, necessitating an analysis of their effectiveness in ASR. Fig. 3-(a) compares performance under different instruction types for generation budget . Methods without specific text update constraints consistently outperform constrained ones, with this trend persisting as increases. Notably, our self-training approach with = 4 matches the performance of non-self-training methods with an = 16 budget. Influence of multi-round self-training. Selftraining enables multiple iterations by refining filtering models across training rounds. Fig. 3-(b) shows the relative gains of diversity-promoting vs. naïve self-training on AudioCaps. Our selftraining significantly improves ASR performance, reaching saturation by the third round. While entropy degrades with conventional self-training, our approach sustains continuous improvement. For Figure 3: Analysis of our proposed framework. Please refer to Sec. 5.3 for detailed explanation. sessment, necessitating evaluation on human agreement. Fig. 3-(c) compares our criterion against human evaluation by five annotators on 50 random MSRVTT test samples. Results show high agreement (F1 > 0.9) regardless of video presence, with moderate to substantial inter-annotator agreement κ (Fleiss, 1971). Although κ is slightly lower for evaluations with videoslikely due to subjective interpretation of longer contextsoverall agreement remains strong (F1 = 0.9091), confirming the reliability of our unimodal assessment. Qualitative examples. Fig. 5 compares generated samples from variants of our method across different modalities. Compared to other variants, our self-training successfully applies various modification without being constrained to specific patterns. Additional examples are provided in Appendix B.9."

            "content": "We explored the compositional vulnerability of pretrained multimodal representations using LLMs. First, we established testbed by proposing MAC, which provides comprehensive set of criteria for evaluating how effectively and diversely target representation can be deceived. Furthermore, we suggested the application of self-training to multimodal compositionality for the first time via iterative RFT with diversity-promoting filtering to improve both ASR and diversity. Lastly, our modalityagnostic assessment allowed for thorough analysis of compositional vulnerabilities across image, video, and audio modalities, where our method consistently outperformed prior arts across various target representations. Our benchmarks modalityagnostic design opens avenues for extending vulnerability analysis to less-explored modalities like IMU or tactile sensing, even in the absence of multimodal LLMs capable of processing these data types.

Influence of large in self-training. To better understand the influence of in distillation-based self-training, we report the ASR of our method using AudioCaps in Fig. 4. While increasing does not display clear signal of saturation, the relative performance gain with respect to (ASR/N ) does. This diminishing return suggests that = 64 offers reasonable balance between performance improvement and time constraint.

Extending MAC (i.e., deceiving pre-trained multimodal representations) to longer, detailed captions (Onoe et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024) represents distinct but promising research direction, as it would require more sophisticated attack strategies that consider long-range dependencies and contextual relationships throughout the caption to successfully deceive target representations."

For COCO (Lin et al., 2014), we adopt the Karpathy test split (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2017) as the test set, which consists of 5,000 images paired with 25,010 captions. The train set corresponds to the COCO 2014 train split, containing 83,287 images and 414,113 captions. For MSRVTT (Xu et al., 2016), we utilize the MSRVTT 1K-A split (Yu et al., 2018) as the test set, which includes 1,000 videos, each associated with single caption. The train set corresponds to the MSRVTT 9K train split, containing 9,000 videos with 180,000 captions. For AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019), we use the test split from Oncescu et al. (2021), which consists of 816 audio clips with 4,080 captions. The train set corresponds to the train split from Oncescu et al. (2021), which includes 49,291 audio clips, each paired with single caption. All datasets contain English language captions and are publicly available, used in accordance with their respective licenses for research purposes. Note that each train set (xi, ti) does not include label for deceptive caption supervision. This absence of supervision serves as the primary motivation for our self-training approach, which aims to generate deceptive captions ti. A.2 Models Target models.

For self-training LLMs, we use batch size of 16, LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) rank of 16, LoRA alpha of 32, and learning rate of 2 104. Each LLM is trained for 3 epochs per round. During multi-round training, we reset the LLM to its original checkpoint at the start of each round, rather than continuing from the last checkpoint, to mitigate overfitting (Zelikman et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2024). All experiments are conducted on single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. All reported results are based on single run per experiment. A.5 Human Evaluation We provide detailed explanation of the human evaluation process described in Sec. 5.3 (Fig. 3- (c)). Two user interfaces were designed for evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT): one without video input  (Fig. 6)  and one with video input from MSRVTT  (Fig. 7)  . For each data point, we collected five annotations to ensure reliability. To maintain annotation quality, annotators were required to provide short explanation for their responses. Additionally, we ensured that AMT workers were fairly compensated at approximately $18 per hour ($0.5 per HIT).

All methods use Llama-3.1-8B with the deceptive-general prompt. as GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023). As shown in Table 13, larger or proprietary models do not necessarily lead to more effective deception. For instance, while GPT-4o achieves the highest ASR, its diversity is lower than that of Llama-3.1-8B. Moreover, Llama-3.1-8B with = 4 achieves significantly higher ASR (24.80 in Table 2) compared to GPT-4o (14.40). This suggests that using smaller model with Best-of-N (> 1) approach is more effective than relying on proprietary model with budget of = 1. B.2 MAC Performance Across Generation Strategies LLMs can generate multiple candidates using two main approaches: sequential generation and parallel generation. Sequential generation involves iteratively refining responses based on the output from the previous turn (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023), whereas parallel generation produces responses simultaneously without refinement process. While the sequential approach achieves slightly higher diversity in Table 14, it underperforms parallel generation in terms of ASR. Additionally, sequential generation has time complexity of O(N ), whereas parallel generation operates with constant time complexity of O(1). This makes sequential generation less practical for selftraining and inference, as it significantly increases computational overhead. Therefore, we adopt parallel generation as the default method for generating multiple candidates.

For instance, I_NOUN_weapon occurs in more than 25% of the generated outputs, while other frequent tokens like I_ADJ_vintage exceed 3%. In contrast, our approach produces much more balanced token distribution, with the most frequent token appearing in less than 1% of cases. B.4 Ablation Study We conduct an ablation study on our method using fine-grained metrics, as shown in Table 15. ASR. As expected, setting = 4 improves cross-modal ASR by 10% points and unimodal ASR by 15.7% points, compared to = 1. Naïve self-training particularly enhances unimodal ASR (+19.3 % points) and the distance-based criterion (+14.4 % points), followed by cross-modal ASR (+6.5 % points). Finally, self-training with largeN and our final method further boost cross-modal ASR, achieving the highest total ASR. Diversity.

Moreover, while entropy typically decreases with selftraining, our approach continues to show consistent improvement, indicating sustained diversity enhancement across different datasets. B.6 MAC Performance Across Diverse Configurations Beyond the COCO, MSRVTT, and AudioCaps datasets, we further explore other datasets: Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014) for image-text, LSMDC (Rohrbach et al., 2017) for video-text, and Clotho (Drossos et al., 2020) for audio-text. For Flickr30K, we adopt the Karpathy test split (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2017) as the test set, which consists of 1,000 images paired with 5,000 captions. The train set contains 29,000 images and 145,000 captions. For LSMDC, we utilize the test split from Li et al. (2023a), which includes 1,000 videos, each associated with single caption. The train set contains 101,020 videos with 101,020 captions. For Clotho, we use the test split from Oncescu et al. (2021), which consists of 1,045 audio clips with 5,225 captions. The train set includes 2,314 audios with 11,570 captions. Table 16 shows that LLMs effectively deceive the target representations across diverse datasets. Furthermore, our method consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of both ASR and diversity. Lastly, to demonstrate that MAC can be readily extended to other target models, we evaluate the performance of our framework using CLAP (Wu et al., 2023) as the target model for the audio-text dataset and compare the results with LanguageBind. As shown in Table 17, we observe that the trends confirmed in the LanguageBind-based experiments Figure 10: Qualitative examples for MAC on Stanford Image Paragraph test set. Bold phrases denote text updates. are also evident in the CLAP-based experiments. However, CLAP exhibits consistently lower ASR across all metrics. We presume this occurs because LanguageBind, which binds multiple modalities at once, may expose greater vulnerability compared to models that focus exclusively on audio-text alignment. B.7 MAC Performance Across Long Captions We further extend our benchmark with long captioning corpora by exploring two different data sources: Stanford Image Paragraph (Krause et al., 2017) for image-text and ActivityNet Captions (Krishna et al., 2017) for video-text, whose average word lengths are 60 and 48, respectively. Following Zhang et al. (2018); Gabeur et al. (2020), we aggregate all sentences from each video in chronological order to obtain long captions from ActivityNet captions. For Stanford Image Paragraph, the test set consists of 2,489 images paired with 2,489 captions. The train set contains 14,575 images and 14,575 captions. For ActivityNet Captions, the test split includes 4,429 videos, each associated with single caption. The train set contains 9,032 videos with 9,032 captions.

For more comprehensive view of our benchmark for longer text inputs, we further share qualitative example that successfully deceived CLIP from Stanford Image Paragraph in Fig. 10. B.8 MAC Performance on Vision Language Models In Table 3, we show that LLMs such as Llama3.1-8B can successfully deceive pre-trained multimodal representations, including CLIP, SigLIP, NegCLIP, and BLIP in COCO. To further extend these pre-trained multimodal representations to recent vision language models (VLMs), we include LLaVA-1.5-7B15 (Liu et al., 2023, 2024) as target representation. Following Li et al. (2024b), we adapt LLaVa-1.5-7B as an image-text matching score calculator by employing the following prompt format: Does this image match the following caption ? Answer Yes or No directly. Then, we extract the logits associated with the responses Yes and No for the next word prediction. We then define the matching score as: score = eP (Yesprompt) eP (Yesprompt) + eP (Noprompt) (9) As shown in Table 19, LLaVA-1.5-7B surprisingly demonstrates high susceptibility to deception, performing even worse than smaller BLIP in our experiments on COCO (ASR 36.38% vs. 15llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf 32.50%). Even without self-training, the ASR remains at 15.30%, indicating that LLaVA-1.5-7B possesses inherent compositional vulnerabilities, too. These findings suggest that recent VLMs can be deceived by carefully crafted text inputs, underscoring critical challenge in their robustness. B.9 Qualitative Results Fig. 11-(a), Fig. 11-(b), and Fig. 11-(c) compare generated samples from different variants of our method across image, video, and audio modalities. Additionally, Fig. 11-(d) presents comparison between our method and prior works (i.e., SugarCrepe, SeeTrue).
