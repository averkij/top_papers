            "content": "Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated superior performance in generating high-quality images and videos, with significantly wider diversity over the traditional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods [4]. However, conventional diffusion models require hundreds or thousands of steps to gradually transform noise into structured data, making them computationally expensive, limiting their practical applications. For instance, the recent open-source video generation model [18] requires around 8 GPUs and 15 minutes to generate single 5-second video clip without extra optimization. Recent works on diffusion step distillation [28, 31, 26, 26] aim to accelerate the generative process by reducing the number of inference steps while maintaining high sample quality. However, most of the research works are on image generation. Despite their promise, these methods often compromise video quality and require carefully designed architectures to achieve satisfactory results. As mentioned in SeaweedAPT [20], when transferred video generation, most of the one-step video generation algorithms still suffer from significant quality degradation such as motion dynamics and structure. In this report, we propose to simplify the video generation task by factorizing it into two separate subtasks: text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. Different from the purpose in Emu Video [? ], which focuses on improving the video generation quality, we focus on reducing the diffusion inference steps. The text-to-image task benefits from its simplicity and wide range of prior research works, making it inherently simpler and requiring fewer diffusion steps. We experimentally observe that diffusion step distillation algorithms converge significantly faster in text-to-image generation while also improving the final generation quality. To further reinforce the generative prior, we incorporate multi-modal inputs by augmenting the text encoder with visual inputs. By leveraging quantization techniques, we reduce memory consumption from 40G to 28G and cut the required diffusion steps from 50 to just 4, achieving optimized performance with minimal degradation in quality. In summary, our contributions are: Generative Prior Injection: We introduce novel acceleration strategy for video generation by injecting stronger generative priors through task factorization. Multi-Modal Guidance: We propose multi-modal guidance mechanism that accelerates model convergence by incorporating visual inputs alongside text inputs. Comprehensive Optimization: By combining suite of model acceleration techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art trade-off in terms of both generation quality and inference efficiency."

            "content": "Video generation has been rapidly evolving research area, leveraging advancements in deep learning and generative models. Early approaches relied on autoregressive models [17], which generate videos frame-by-frame based on past frames, but suffered from compounding errors over time. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [2] and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [34, 7] were later introduced 2 to improve video synthesis, offering better visual fidelity but struggling with temporal consistency over longer sequences. More recent breakthroughs have been driven by Transformer-based architectures and diffusion models. VideoGPT [39] adapts GPT-like architectures for video tokenization and synthesis, capturing long-term dependencies effectively. Diffusion models have also demonstrated promising results, with works like Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) [12] extending the success of image diffusion models to videos by modeling spatiotemporal dynamics through iterative denoising. Additionally, latent space-based methods such as Imagen Video [13] and Make-A-Video [30] focus on efficient high-resolution synthesis by operating in compressed representation space. These methods have significantly advanced the field, enabling the generation of realistic, temporally coherent videos with high fidelity. Recent advancements in diffusion step distillation have introduced various methods to accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models, aiming to reduce computational costs while maintaining high-quality outputs. Salimans and Ho (2022) proposed Progressive Distillation, which iteratively halves the number of sampling steps required by training student models to match the output of teacher models with more steps, thereby achieving faster sampling without significant loss in image quality [28]. Meng et al. (2023) developed distillation approach for classifier-free guided diffusion models, significantly speeding up inference by reducing the number of sampling steps required for high-fidelity image generation [21]. Geng et al. (2024) introduced method that distills diffusion models into single-step generator models using deep equilibrium architectures, achieving efficient sampling with minimal loss in image quality [9]. Watson et al. (2024) proposed EM Distillation, maximum likelihood-based approach that distills diffusion model into one-step generator model, effectively reducing the number of sampling steps while preserving perceptual quality [36]. Zhou et al. (2024) presented Simple and Fast Distillation (SFD), which simplifies existing distillation paradigms and reduces fine-tuning time by up to 1000 times while achieving high-quality image generation [42]. Yin et al. (2024) introduced Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), procedure to transform diffusion model into one-step image generator with minimal impact on image quality [40]. These developments contribute to making diffusion-based generative models more practical for real-world applications by substantially decreasing computational demands."

            "content": "Image Prior Generation We use both diffusion-based and retrieval-based methods for getting the images. We define unified function that combines both diffusion-based generation and retrieval-based augmentation: x0 = G(xT , y, R(y); θ), (1) where xT (0, I) represents the initial noise, is the textual input, R(y) is the retrieved set of relevant images, and θ represents the model parameters. The retrieval function is formally defined as: R(y) = {ri ri = arg max xD sim(ϕ(y), ψ(x))}, (2) where is the image corpus, ϕ(y) and ψ(x) are text and image embeddings, respectively, and sim(, ) is similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity). The retrieved images serve as additional conditioning signals in the denoising process: xt1 = xt αtϵθ(xt, t, y, R(y)) + σtz, (3) where ϵθ is the learned noise prediction model, αt is the step size, σt is the noise variance, and (0, I). This retrieval-augmented diffusion process ensures that the generated image maintains both high fidelity and factual accuracy. Recent methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) [27] and kNN-Diffusion [29] have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, significantly improving the realism and contextual alignment of generated images. Figure 4: The overview of model acceleration techniques, including DMD2 and CFG distillation. Image Prior Injection and Multi-modal Guidance Design The Image-to-Video (I2V) task involves generating video that aligns with given text description, using an input image as the first frame. Specifically, the T2V model takes as input latent tensor of shape , where , C, H, and correspond to the number of frames, channels, height, and width of the compressed video, respectively. Similar to Emu Video [10], to incorporate the image condition I, we treat as the first frame of the video and apply zero-padding to construct tensor Io of dimensions , as shown in Fig. 3. Additionally, we introduce binary mask with shape 1 , where the first temporal position is set to 1, and all subsequent positions are set to zero. The latent tensor X, the padded tensor Io, and the mask are then concatenated along the channel dimension to form the input to the model. Figure 3: Overall Architecture of Magic 1-For-1. in(= 2C + 1), Cout, sh, sw). Here, Cin and Since the input tensors channel dimension increases from to 2C + 1, as shown in Fig. 3, we adjust the parameters of the models first convolutional module from ϕ = (Cin(= C), Cout, sh, sw) to ϕ = (C in represent the input channels before and after modification, Cout is the number of output channels, and sh and sw correspond to the height and width of the convolutional kernel, respectively. To preserve the representational capability of the T2V model, the first input channels of ϕ are copied from ϕ, while the additional channels are initialized to zero. The I2V model is pre-trained on the same dataset as the T2V model to ensure consistency. To further enhance the semantic alignment of reference images, we extract their embeddings via the vision branch of the VLM text encoder and concatenate them with the text embeddings, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This integration improves the models ability to generate videos that better capture the context provided by both the image and the textual description. 3.1 Diffusion Distillation The iterative nature of diffusion model inference, characterized by its multi-step sampling procedure, introduces significant bottleneck to inference speed. This issue is particularly exacerbated in largescale models such as our 13B parameter diffusion model, Magic 1-For-1, where the computational 4 cost of each individual sampling step is substantial. As depicted in Fig. 4, we address this challenge by implementing dual distillation approach, incorporating both step distillation and CFG distillation to achieve faster sampling. For step distillation, we leverage DMD2, state-of-the-art algorithm engineered for efficient distribution alignment and accelerated sampling. Inspired by score distillation sampling (SDS) [25], DMD2 facilitates step distillation through coordinated training paradigm involving three distinct models. These include: the one/four-step generator Gϕ, whose parameters are iteratively optimized; the real video model ureal θ , tasked with approximating the underlying real data distribution preal; and the fake video model ufake , which estimates the generated (fake) data distribution pfake. Crucially, all three models are initialized from the same pre-trained model, ensuring coherence and streamlining the training process. The distribution matching objective for step distillation can be mathematically expressed as: θ ϕLDMD EtϕDKL (pfakepreal) Et (cid:90) (cid:16) ϵ [zt σtureal θ (zt, t) zt + σtufake θ (zt, t)] Gϕ(ϵ) ϕ (cid:17) dϵ . (4) Here, zt stands for the video latent at the timestep t, and zt = σtz1 + (1 σt)ˆz0, with ˆz0 representing the output synthesized by the few-step generator, and σt denoting the noise schedule. This formulation reframes the conventional score function-based distribution matching (inherent in standard DMD2) into novel approach that focuses on distribution alignment at time step = 0. This adaptation is crucial to ensure consistency with the training methodology employed in Magic 1-For-1. Furthermore, DMD2 necessitates the real-time updating of ufake to guarantee an accurate approximation of the fake data distribution, pfake. This update is governed by the following loss function: θ Lfake = Eˆz0,z1,t[0,1] (cid:20)(cid:13) (cid:13)z1 ˆz0 ufake (cid:13) θ (cid:0)zt, t(cid:1)(cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:21) . (5) In the practical implementation, training DMD2 requires the simultaneous use of three models, which makes it infeasible to fit the models for standard training even under the ZeRO3 configuration with 2 nodes equipped with 8 GPUs, each having 80GB of memory. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging LoRA to handle parameter updates of the fake model. Additionally, we observed that directly training with the standard DMD2 approach often leads to training collapse. This issue arises because the input to the real model is derived from the output of the few-step generator, whose data distribution differs significantly from the training data distribution used during the pre-training phase. To mitigate this problem, we adopt straightforward yet effective solution: slightly shifting the parameters of the real model towards those of the fake model. This is achieved by adjusting the weight factor associated with the low-rank branch. This adjustment helps align the data distributions, ensuring stable training. During the inference phase of diffusion models, Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance (CFG) [14, 6] is frequently employed at each sampling step. CFG enhances the fidelity of the generated results with respect to the specified conditions by performing additional computations under dropoutconditioning. To eliminate this computational overhead and boost inference speed, we implemented CFG distillation [21]. We define distillation objective that trains the student model, us θ, to directly produce the guided outputs. Specifically, we minimize the following expectations over timesteps and guidance strengths: Lcfg = Ewpw,tU [0,1] (cid:2) ˆuθ(zt, t, w, Ts) us θ(zt, t, w, Ts)2 2 (cid:3) , where ˆuθ(zt, t, w, Ts) = (1 + w)uθ(zt, t, Ts) wuθ(zt, t, ) (6) (7) represents the linearly interpolated prediction between conditional and unconditional outputs. Ts stands for the text prompt. In this formulation, pw(w) = [wmin, wmax] dictates that the guidance strength parameters are sampled uniformly during training, which empowers the distilled model to effectively handle wide range of guidance scales without necessitating retraining. To integrate the guidance weight, w, we supplied it as an extra input to our student model. This distillation process effectively condenses the traditional CFG calculation into single, streamlined forward pass. We construct the overall distillation objective, Ldistillation, as weighted sum of two loss terms. The CFG distillation loss serves to align the student models outputs with the teachers guided predictions, while 5 Table 1: Quantitative results comparison using Magic 1-For-1 on our customized VBench.

(cid:1)(cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (8) (9) Here, λcfg is the balancing coefficient for overall distillation loss. 3.2 Model Quantization We leverage the optimum-quanto framework for model quantization, employing int8 weight-only quantization to minimize the models memory footprint. The quantization strategy specifically targets the denoising network, encompassing the transformer blocks, the text encoder, and the VLM encoder. The quantization process maps the original bfloat16 weights to int8 values. common approach involves scaling the bfloat16 values to suitable range before conversion. For instance, one might determine the maximum absolute value within tensor of weights, scale all weights such that this maximum value corresponds to the maximum representable int8 value (127 or -128), and then perform the conversion. simplified illustration of this scaling could be represented as: (cid:18) wint8 = round wbf16 (cid:19) 127 max(wbf16) (10) where wbf16 represents the original bfloat16 weight, wint8 the quantized int8 weight, and max(wbf16) the maximum absolute value within the weight tensor. In practice, more sophisticated methods like per-channel quantization or quantization aware training can be used for better performance. To mitigate potential CUDA errors and ensure numerical stability during inference, all linear layers within the model initially convert their inputs to bfloat16 before performing the matrix multiplication with the quantized int8 weights. This bfloat16-int8 multiplication helps maintain accuracy while still benefiting from the reduced memory footprint of the int8 weights. Before quantization, the models weights occupy approximately 32GB. After applying int8 quantization, the model size is reduced to about 16GB. During runtime, the peak memory usage is around 30GB. This optimized model is then capable of running on consumer-grade and inference-focused GPUs, including the RTX 5090, A10, and L20."

            "content": "4.1 Experimental Setup Foundation Model Selection The text to image generation task is better explored, compared to image to video generation task. Thus, we use pool of pre-trained T2I models [19, 23, 37, 1] or user provided images directly. For I2V task, we use the pre-trained T2V HunyuanVideo 13B model [18] as the base model and modify based on it. 4.2 Implementation Details We use 128 GPUs with batch size 64. We train the model for two weeks. The initial learning rate is set to be 5 105 and progressively decrease to 1 105. We also apply exponential moving Figure 5: Model performance progression during training. Interestingly, T2V Magic 1-For-1 exhibits considerably slower convergence in step distillation compared to TI2V Magic 1-For-1. average (EMA) [22] for stable training. The model was trained on subset with 1.6M data samples collected from WebVid-10M [3], Panda-70M [5], Koala-36M [35], and the Internet data. For step distillation, we explore the integration of CFG distillation into the training process of DMD2, aiming to produce few-step generator within single stage of training. DMD2 is trained with batch size of 16 and fixed learning rate of 2 106. During training, the few-step generator is updated after every five updates of the fake model. Additionally, in DMD2 training, the weight factor for the low-rank branch is set to 0.25 for the real model and 1 for the fake model, respectively. 4.3 Benchmarks We utilize our customized VBench, General VBench, and traditional metrics such as FID, FVD, and LPIPS to evaluate the performance of the model. However, due to resource constraints, we do not employ the model with an extensive number of inference steps, as is done in recent state-of-the-art models like MovieGen [24]. Instead, our focus is directed toward the efficiency aspect of the model. In this report, we conduct performance measurements of the base model using 4, 8, 16, 28, and 56 steps. For the few-step generator, we evaluate its performance using 4 and 8 steps. Our Customized VBench. We use I2V VBench for portrait video synthesis evaluation [16]. We first collect 58 high-quality widescreen images and leverage InternVL-26B to generate corresponding prompts for these images. For each sample, we then synthesize five videos, resulting in total of 290 videos, to reduce potential testing errors. The synthesized videos are subsequently evaluated using VBench. The primary evaluation metrics include i2v subject, subject consistency, motion smoothness, dynamic degree, aesthetic quality, imaging quality, and temporal flickering. General VBench. We also evaluate Magic 1-For-1s performance on the General VBench [15] dataset, which consists of the official prompts paired with reference images. Similar to the I2VVBench evaluation, this benchmark assesses i2v subject, subject consistency, motion smoothness, dynamic degree, aesthetic quality, imaging quality, and temporal flickering. Notably, this benchmark includes 1,118 prompts, each paired with reference image, to provide diverse and comprehensive evaluation. FID, FVD and LPIPS. In portrait video synthesis, key metrics for evaluating video quality include FID [11], FVD [33], and LPIPS [41]. Following the approaches outlined in EMO [32] and Hallo [8], we randomly sample 100 video clips from the VFHQ [38] dataset. Each selected clip contains 129 frames, with resolution and frame rate standardized to 540960 and 24 FPS, respectively. To evaluate performance, we calculate the FID and FVD scores by comparing the synthesized videos against their corresponding original videos. 4.4 Experiment Results Our experiments contains three primary components. First, ablation studies reveal that the 4-step DMD2 training achieves optimal performance, and that TI2V step distillation is significantly less challenging to train compared to T2V step distillation. Next, we evaluate the performance differences 7 between the few-step generator and the base model on both portrait video synthesis and general video synthesis tasks. Lastly, we compare Magic 1-For-1 with other state-of-the-art TI2V models to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm. Convergence Speed Comparison. Due to the powerful generative capabilities of the Magic 1-For-1 base model, fine-tuning this large-scale model to enable high-quality synthetic video generation with minimal sampling steps requires relatively low computational overhead. As shown in Fig. 5, applying DMD2 for step distillation on the TI2V base model achieves near convergence within 100 iterations. Specifically, the optimal 4-step generator is obtained at 200 iterations, while the optimal 8-step generator is achieved at merely 100 iterations. Notably, whereas DMD2 demonstrates rapid convergence on the TI2V few-step synthesis task, its performance on the T2V few-step synthesis task remains far from convergence even after 1,000 iterations and significantly underperforms compared to the TI2V counterpart. Figure 6: Qualitative comparison of Magic 1-For-1 with recent state-of-the-art open source image-tovideo generation models. Performance Comparison between Few-Step Generators. We evaluate the performance of our few-step generator and base model on both our customized VBench and the General VBench. Our customized VBench is specifically designed for portrait video synthesis tasks, while the General VBench targets generic video generation. The comparative results are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1, respectively. From Table 1, it can be observed that the base models performance gradually improves as the number of sampling steps increases. Notably, the 50-step base model underperforms the 4-step generator across metrics such as motion dynamics, visual quality, and semantic faithfulness, indicating that our improved DMD2 effectively mitigates certain detrimental biases inherent in the base model. Moreover, Magic 1-For-1 (DMD2) demonstrates strong performance on the general VBench benchmark. As illustrated in Fig. 1, Magic 1-For-1 (DMD2) outperforms competing methodsincluding SVD-XT-1.0, VideoCrafter-I2V, SEINE-512x320, I2Vgen-XL, and CogVideoXI2Vacross multiple evaluation dimensions such as motion dynamics and visual fidelity. This success underscores the superiority of Magic 1-For-1 in TI2V generation tasks. Performance Comparison With SOTA Models. We also compare the visual quality of our model with recent open-source image-to-video generation models. As shown in Fig. 6, our model 8 demonstrates significantly superior video quality, particularly in terms of visual clarity and motion smoothness."
