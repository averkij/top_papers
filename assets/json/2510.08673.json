            "content": "For machines, cameras serve as the primary interface to the physical world, enabling spatial intelligence that underlies applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous driving. In general, two principal camera-centric objectives work in tandem to enable machines to perceive and interact with their spatial context. On the one hand, understanding the camera geometry from images (Pollefeys et al., 1999; Hold-Geoffroy et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Veicht et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025c), namely how the 3D world is projected onto the 2D image plane, lays the foundation for machines to recover spatial structure and navigate complex environments. On the other hand, by modulating intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, cameras encode spatial relationships and offer flexible control over spatial content generation (He et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Ren et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025; Bernal-Berdun et al., 2025; Ball et al., 2025), which simulates how the world appears from any viewpoint or orientation. To date, these two perspectives have been commonly treated as isolated problems and independently explored by the research community. In this work, we make the first attempt to unify camera-centric understanding and generation in cohesive framework. Motivated by recent progress in unified understanding and generation with large multimodal models (LMMs) (Team, 2024; Wu et al., 2025d; 2024; Pan et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025b), we extend this paradigm to the spatial domain, where camera geometry plays central role. However, unlike language or images, camera parameters are abstract and non-intuitive: they describe FoV, orientation, or perspective in numerical form rather than semantic content. This discrepancy introduces modality gap when integrating cameras into LMMs. For instance, when users specify 20 roll or 35mm lens for controllable generation, existing models often ignore or misinterpret such cues, pursuing semantic alignment while neglecting precise spatial control. Similarly, current LMMs tend to collapse geometric details into coarse representations when understanding camera information, leading to spatially inconsistent outputs. As result, na√Øvely extending LMMs cannot resolve conflicts between modalities, producing suboptimal performance in both tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Puffin, unified multimodal framework that interprets cameras as first-class modality. Puffin combines autoregressive and diffusion modeling to jointly perform camera-centric understanding and generation1. Instead of treating camera parameters as auxiliary labels, Puffin introduces the notion of thinking with camera, aligning spatially grounded visual cues with professional photographic terminology while reasoning over geometric context. This design provides shared chain-of-thought across multimodal tasks, enabling spatially consistent understanding and controllably aligned generation. To support this framework, we construct Puffin-4M, large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-languagecamera triplets. Puffin-4M includes single-view images with precise camera parameters, descriptive 1We mainly focus on single-view calibration and text-to-image controllable generation, but Puffin can be flexibly extended to cross-view understanding and generation via instruction tuning (see Figure 10)."

We propose thinking with camera, novel mechanism that guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic terminology, bridging the modality gap between camera and vision-language and enabling effective spatial reasoning.

            "content": "Large Multimodal Models. Built upon visual encoder (Radford et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023; Tschannen et al., 2025) and large language model (LLM) (Touvron et al., 2023; Qwen et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), LMMs (Liu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2024a; Bai et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025) process mixed visual and textual inputs and perform understanding and reasoning via language generation. Fueled by large-scale pre-training of the vision and language models and sophisticated instruction-tuning, LMMs excel at high-level understanding tasks, such as object localization, counting, and optical character recognition. However, these models, optimized for semantic alignment between vision and language, remain limited in capturing image intrinsics (e.g., depth and geometry), which constrains their ability in camera understanding and spatial reasoning. To bridge this gap, it is crucial to enrich LMMs with geometry-aware prior knowledge that preserves structural details beyond semantics. Moreover, aligning such geometric cues with linguistic tokens provides pathway to extend the reasoning capacity of LMMs from abstract semantics to physically grounded spatial understanding. Unified Multimodal Models. As an extension of standard LMMs, unified multimodal models (Team, 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025d; Lin et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2024b; Pan et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025a; Wu et al., 2025c; Chen et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025b; Xie et al., 2024; 2025a) jointly learn visual understanding and generation within single framework. Two main design philosophies are typically adopted. One line of work formulates visual generation as autoregression over either discrete (Team, 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2025b) or continuous (Fan et al., 2025) image tokens, sharing LLM parameters for both understanding and generation. Another line (Pan et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025c; Lin et al., 2025a) aligns pre-trained LMMs with diffusion modules, enabling faster convergence and lower training cost. While both types of models advance general image understanding and generation, they are constrained to simplistic camera assumptions (e.g., fixed front-view, predefined FoVs), hindering their practical applicability to realistic and complex environments. To this end, we introduce camera-centric framework that jointly performs camera understanding and controllable generation. Camera Geometry from Vision. Tasks such as camera calibration and pose estimation have long been central topic in 3D vision (Pollefeys et al., 1999; Hartley & Zisserman, 2003; Liao et al., 2023; Veicht et al., 2024; Hold-Geoffroy et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025c). While earlier learning-based works attempted to directly regress camera parameters from input images (Hold-Geoffroy et al., 2018; Workman et al., 2015; Bogdan et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2016; Kendall et al., 2015), recent advances increasingly explore the use of intermediate representations or geometry fields to bridge the prediction gap. Representative approaches (Lee et al., 2020; 2021; Song et al., 2024; Janampa & Pattichis, 2024; Yin et al., 2018) leverage geometric structures or semantic"

Building on priors of the camera model and the perspective properties of captured images, growing body of methods proposes to learn dense geometry fields, such as distortion distribution maps (Liao et al., 2020; 2021), pixel displacement fields (Li et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025b), camera rays (Zhang et al., 2024), perspective fields (Jin et al., 2023; Veicht et al., 2024; Tirado-Gar√≠n & Civera, 2025), or incidence fields (Zhu et al., 2023; He et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2024).

The generated text consists of concise description or spatial reasoning along with the estimated camera parameters (i.e., roll, pitch, FoV) of the input image. Unlike previous methods that directly estimate the parameters from images, our approach integrates camera geometry within the text and performs next-token prediction in multimodal sequence modeling paradigm. Motivation. As illustrated in Figure 3 (left), previous classical and learning-based methods focus on extracting or learning representations to predict the camera parameters, such as geometric structures (Pautrat et al., 2023) or semantic features with confidence estimates (Veicht et al., 2024). However, these representations often emphasize low-/mid-level patterns, limiting their ability to capture holistic and coherent spatial concept. As result, existing approaches tend to excel in scenarios with rich features but struggle to generalize across diverse visual environments. Thinking. Instead of focusing on how to learn representation, we propose to interpret the camera as language and introduce the notion of thinking with camera. It guides the LMMs to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic terminology while reasoning across geometric context. The details of each key element are elaborated below."

            "content": "Figure 3: Methods for learning camera geometry. (Left) Previous classical and learning-based methods focused on extracting or learning representations such as geometric structures or semantic features (with confidence). (Right) We introduce the notion of thinking with camera through LMMs. It first decouples the camera parameters across geometric context, establishing connections between spatially grounded visual cues (highlighted in the masked regions) and professional photographic terms. The camera parameters are then predicted within the <answer></answer> tag through this spatial reasoning process <think></think>. Spatially Grounded Visual Cues. The 3D world is governed by physical laws, where gravity and human design shape stable spatial regularities that serve as strong perceptual priors. Texture-less regions such as sky, ceilings, floors, or ground surfaces lack local features but encode vertical regularities critical for pitch estimation. Similarly, FoV estimation relies on perceiving spatial composition, including the foregroundbackground ratio, object scale, and depth distribution. While such properties are difficult to infer from purely visual representations, they are implicitly captured by LMMs as knowledge priors. Thus, we embed these spatially grounded visual cues into our thinking captions, enabling the model to perform explicit spatial reasoning about camera geometry. Professional Photographic Terms. Existing LMMs typically acquire over-abstracted semantics, whereas the detailed numerical values of camera parameters are too fine-grained to estimate precisely. As practical alternative, professional photographic terms (e.g., close-up, tilt-up, Dutch angle) are widely used in annotations and well aligned with LMM knowledge (Liu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Lin et al., 2025c). Thus, we leverage them as intermediate supervisory signals to naturally bridge low-/mid-level camera geometry and high-level multimodal reasoning. These terms, derived as quantized abstractions of camera parameters, are merged with textual scene descriptions, making global spatial arrangements linguistically accessible. The parameter-to-term mapping can be formulated as : (cid:55) t, in which the mapping is shown in Table A1. Geometric Context. As shown in Figure 3 (right), we decouple camera parameters across geometric context (roll, pitch, and FoV), which aligns specific spatially grounded visual cues such as sky, foreground composition, and object-level depth ordering with each professional photographic terminology. By anchoring numerical attributes to semantically meaningful descriptors, our framework bridges abstract visual features and physically interpretable geometry. The final parameters are predicted through this structured spatial reasoning. With the above designs, we interpret the camera as language by grounding its physical attributes in stable spatial regularities. Numerical parameters are abstracted into professional photographic terms, providing semantic vocabulary aligned with LMMs. Through this mapping, camera geometry becomes linguistically interpretable, allowing structured spatial reasoning for accurate camera parameter prediction. We visualize more reasoning results in Figure A2. Choosing Suitable Vision Encoder. straightforward approach to camera understanding is to fine-tune existing LMMs that couple vision encoder with an LLM, but this na√Øve strategy faces two major limitations: (i) vision encoders in LMMs are primarily designed for recognition tasks and thus yield condensed features lacking geometric fidelity, and (ii) language components contain little prior knowledge of spatial perception, reducing adaptability to camera-centric tasks. As result, such fine-tuning can lead to performance bottlenecks and even underperform pure visionbased methods (see Section 5.4). To overcome these issues, we introduce geometry-aligned vision encoder distilled from both semantic (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) and vision-centric (e.g., DINO, SAM) teachers (Heinrich et al., 2025), offering versatile features that preserve geometric fidelity while"

            "title": "3.2 CAMERA-CONTROLLABLE GENERATION",
            "content": "Motivation. Unlike image understanding, image generation requires complex cross-modal alignment and the synthesis of fine-grained visual details. As discussed in Section 3.1, the detailed numerical values of camera parameters are too specific for current LMMs to interpret effectively, failing to faithfully capture the realistic spatial distribution required for camera-controllable generation. Thinking. To address this, we design step-by-step process that integrates visual detail analysis with reasoning. The model first infers the potential visual cues from vanilla captions, and then uses this textual reasoning as semantic planning stage to guide image generation. For instance, large pitch value may correspond to an expansive sky with clouds in outdoor scenes or to pendant lights and uncluttered ceilings indoors. Beyond textual reasoning, numerical camera parameters are translated into professional photographic terms more suitable for LMMs, naturally aligning with the reasoning process in camera understanding. We therefore adopt shared chain-of-thought mechanism between understanding and controllable generation. As shown in Figure 1 (c), given small pitch value and caption describing modern interior, our method translates the value into photographic term (e.g., small tilt-down), imagines salient cues such as windowsill, and produces more precise spatial simulation than the baseline. Flexible and Faithful Control. The pipeline of camera-controllable generation is shown in Figure 2 (right). The key design is to incorporate pixel-wise camera maps as continuous latent of camera geometry, apart from the discrete camera tokens derived from numerical parameters. Unlike tokens that capture only global attributes, these dense maps encode local geometric context at each pixel, including orientation and displacement cues (Jin et al., 2023). By converting maps into continuous latent, the diffusion model receives fine-grained spatial priors that preserve global camera settings while adapting to subtle geometric variations, thus offering flexible control of spatial layout and viewpoint. Additionally, we introduce connector module as an adaptive interface between the LLM and the diffusion model, where set of learnable queries together with text and camera tokens extract and restructure LLM hidden representations, which are then projected into conditioning signals for generation Pan et al. (2025); Wu et al. (2025c). This design enables semantic and geometric understanding from the LLM to faithfully guide the diffusion model. 3."

In this stage, we align the vision encoder with the LLM by training only the MLP projector for the understanding task, where the framework learns to predict both text descriptions and camera parameters from the input image. For generation, the framework takes text descriptions, camera parameters, and the camera map as inputs, and learns to synthesize the target image with the corresponding description and configuration. Specifically, we train learnable queries and connector to bridge the LLM and the diffusion transformer, where the connector maps LLM hidden states into conditioning signals for the diffusion model. cross-entropy loss and diffusion loss supervise the understanding and generation, respectively, while parameters of the vision encoder, LLM, and diffusion model remain frozen. Stage II-SFT. After aligning different modalities, we unfreeze all modules except the VAE and fine-tune the entire framework, using the same inputs and outputs as in Stage I. To stabilize training, we apply gradient scaling of 0.1 to the vision encoder. Stage III-SFT w/ Thinking. To further bridge the modality gap between the camera and vision-language, we introduce thinking with camera in this stage. The implementation is the same as Stage-II, except that the training data contains spatial reasoning captions (the details of obtaining such captions are provided in Section 4). Beyond generation and understanding, this stage also learns the textual reasoning task, which enriches the vanilla captions with spatially grounded visual cues and translates specific camera parameter values into professional photographic terms. Stage IV-Instruction Tuning. Finally, we improve our models ability to adapt to diverse spatial configurations. In particular, three types of cross-view data are trained simultaneously, including the spatial imagination, world exploration, and photographic guidance. The KV cache mechanism is utilized in cross-view generation. The vision encoder is frozen while other modules are trainable.

The overview of our Puffin-4M is shown in Figure 4. The construction of this curated dataset consists of four stages: panoramic data collection and preprocessing, perspective image generation, scene and spatial reasoning captioning, and extensions for cross-view scenarios. Following previous works (Veicht et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2023; Bernal-Berdun et al., 2025; Hold-Geoffroy et al., 2018), we render the perspective images with various camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from 360 panoramic images using standard camera model. The pipeline of the dataset construction is illustrated in Figure 5 and the dataset comparison with previous works is listed in Table 2. More details are described as follows. Panoramic Data Collection and Preprocessing. We begin by collecting panoramic images from publicly available datasets (Bertel et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2020; Bernal-Berdun et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2018; Bolduc et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2018; Veicht et al., 2024; Armeni et al., 2017) as well as from online platforms (Fli; Str; Wik; HDR; Pol; Amb; Ble; You). In addition, we acquire large volume of outdoor panoramic data from Google Street View (Goo), spanning 12 cities across Asia, Europe, and North America. In total, our curated dataset comprises approximately 200K high-quality panoramic images with substantial diversity. significant portion of these images reaches 4K resolution or higher, up to 10K. However, due to variations in 360 camera calibration and acquisition stability, some panoramas exhibit geometric distortions and misalignment. To mitigate this, we apply geometric correction techniques based on line segmentation and vanishing point estimation (Jiang et al., 2022; Zou et al., 2018), aligning the panoramas with the gravity direction and improving structural consistency. Perspective Image Generation. We adopt the pinhole camera model with varying intrinsic parameters (vertical FoV) and extrinsic parameters (roll and pitch) to synthesize perspective images, following the protocol established in recent state-of-the-art camera calibration works (Veicht et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2023). For each panoramic image, we generate multiple perspective crops by uniformly sampling roll, pitch, and vertical FoV within the ranges [45, 45], [45, 45], and [20, 105], respectively. The number of crops is adaptively determined based on the resolution of the original panorama. While our current setup assumes an ideal pinhole model, incorporating radial distortion effects via an additional distortion parameter is left as future work. After generating the perspective images, we further convert the corresponding camera parameters into pixel-wise Perspective Field (Jin et al., 2023) as camera map, where each pixel is annotated with its up-vector ux and latitude angle œÜx to enable"

Scene and Spatial Reasoning Captions. Captions are essential for multimodal understanding and generation. To construct high-quality descriptions, we first utilize Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2025) to generate semantically rich captions for each perspective image. These are subsequently distilled using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2024) into shorter, vivid, and visually expressive sentences. To bridge the modality gap between camera geometry and vision-language representations, we introduce the notion of thinking with camera that explicitly guides multimodal tasks using spatially grounded visual cues and professional photographic terms. For captioning such spatial reasoning process, we propose two-step strategy: first, we map the numerical camera parameters to their corresponding semantic photographic terms (see Table A1); then, for each camera parameter, we use its corresponding photographic terms to retrieve and prompt out relevant visual concepts from the LMMs prior knowledge. For the trade-off between accuracy and efficacy, we employ Qwen2.5-VL32B-Instruct to generate the final spatial reasoning captions. Cross-View Extension. In addition to the single-view dataset construction described above, we further enrich our dataset with cross-view data involving various tasks. Specifically, during cross-view"

The initial view is initialized with standard camera pose (roll = pitch = yaw = 0), and the target view is rendered using random camera pose sampled within the aforementioned ranges. The target view in each cross-view pair is then captioned using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct. For the photographic guidance task, we first consulted photography experts and enthusiasts to identify four key aspects of photographic aesthetics: viewpoint creativity, subject emphasis, compositional balance, and spatial harmonization. These are then formulated into four criteria that serve as aesthetic rating prompts for LMMs. We focus on pitch and yaw as the key controllable camera parameters2. An initial view is generated with random pitch in [20, 20], and neighboring views are sampled by perturbing pitch and yaw within the same range. All rendered views are evaluated by Qwen2.5-VL32B-Instruct using the aesthetic prompts, and scores are assigned through voting. The pitch and yaw offsets between the initial view and the highest-scoring view are taken as labels for the photographic guidance task. Prompt Design. For the scene caption of each image, the prompt is formatted as: Describe this image in 3-4 sentences. Then, we refine the caption into more compact description using: Here is detailed image description: <caption>. Rewrite it into much shorter, vivid, and visually rich sentence (one or two sentences) that captures only the most essential elements and atmosphere of the scene.

Notably, images from these datasets are primarily captured or simulated in well-structured environments, where buildings, rooms, or trees occupy substantial portion of the scene. Moreover, the camera parameters in some datasets are limited in distribution; for instance, TartanAir uses single FoV for all images. To complement these settings, we construct more challenging dataset, Puffin-Und, designed for comprehensive assessment of camera understanding. This dataset contains 1,000 images spanning diverse camera configurations and scenarios. Comparison Results. As shown in Table 3, our method outperforms the baselines on MegaDepth and Puffin-Und, and achieves comparable results on TartanAir and LaMAR. Due to the fixed image resolution in our training data (512 512), we adopt central cropping strategy followed by resizing to rectangular inputs for evaluating non-square images. The vertical FoV is then computed from the predicted value and scaled according to the crop ratio. Nevertheless, this procedure may discard semantically valid content and thereby degrade our camera understanding performance, particularly when the aspect ratio deviates substantially from unity, as in LaMAR, where Puffin slightly underperforms the state-of-the-art method (Veicht et al., 2024). While this limitation is orthogonal to our current exploration, it could be potentially mitigated in future work by constructing multi-scale training dataset. We present the horizon lines derived from the predicted camera parameters of different methods in Figure A3. Compared to prior approaches, our Puffin demonstrates strong performance not only in common scenarios such as architectural and indoor scenes, but also in challenging cases characterized by limited geometric features or significantly tilted camera poses. These results highlight the robustness of the proposed method. Discussion. From the quantitative evaluation of existing methods, we observe that estimating pitch and FoV is considerably more challenging than estimating roll. This difference arises from the nature of"

To mitigate the data gap for the multimodal models, we convert the camera parameters in captions from radians to degrees or express them using professional photographic terms. For quantitative evaluation, we adopt an offline method (Veicht et al., 2024) to estimate pixel-wise camera maps. Using the ground truth maps, we then compute the mean and median errors of the up vector, latitude, and gravity, all measured in degrees. Since no benchmark dataset exists for text-toimage generation with precise camera parameters, we construct Puffin-Gen to fill this gap. The dataset consists of 650 captioncamera pairs spanning diverse scenarios and camera configurations. We will release Puffin-Gen and Puffin-Und to support standardized evaluation and facilitate subsequent works. Comparison Results. We report quantitative and qualitative results in Table 4 and Figure 6. Our method outperforms existing multimodal models by large margin across all metrics. While these models produce high-quality and aesthetically pleasing images, they fail to ensure spatially consistent layouts under specific camera configurations. PreciseCam (Bernal-Berdun et al., 2025) provides effective control but often generates monotonous stylized outputs (e.g., anime) with limited diversity, and struggles with challenging configurations such as significantly tilted poses. In contrast, our method generalizes well across diverse scenarios and camera settings, demonstrating strong practicality for real-world image generation. Additional generated results are shown in Figure A5 and parameterspecific controls in Figure A6. Discussion. We further conduct an in-depth analysis to understand why existing image generation models fail to achieve accurate spatial simulation. Specifically, we decouple the spatial distributions of the generated images with respect to three camera parameters: roll, pitch, and FoV. As illustrated in Figure 7, we visualize scatter plots of the predicted vs. ground truth camera parameters (with the reference line = x) across all generated samples. For fairness, the predicted camera parameters are obtained using the state-of-the-art vision-based camera calibration method (Veicht et al., 2024). Interestingly, we observe reversed role of camera parameters in controllable generation compared with camera understanding. Specifically, images generated by previous methods (OpenAI, 2025; Wu et al., 2025a; Google DeepMind, 2025; Bernal-Berdun et al., 2025) exhibit poor simulation accuracy on roll compared to pitch, where the predicted roll values fail to align with the target ground truth. In contrast, roll estimation in camera understanding is generally easier than pitch, due to its explicit link with geometric structures. We attribute this discrepancy to two main factors: (i) Most existing image generation models are trained on datasets curated for high visual aesthetics. Both professional and amateur photographers tend to prefer near-level shots, as humans are sensitive to horizontal perturbations (He et al., 2013; Howard & Templeton, 1966; Dyde et al., 2006).

As discussed in Section 3.1, directly fine-tuning the existing VLMs yields significant performance bottleneck since their vision encoders learn overly condensed high-level features and language models have little prior knowledge of spatial perception. As listed in Table 5, directly finetuning the current VLMs (Bai et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025) even underperforms the vision-only network. To this end, we carefully pair an LLM (Qwen et al., 2024) with the vision encoder (Heinrich et al., 2025); both of them are first aligned and then fine-tuned on the camera understanding dataset. By jointly integrating the geometric perception and context understanding in staged optimization manner, our method (Ours) outperforms the above approaches on all evaluation metrics. Thinking with Camera. To mitigate the modality gap between camera and visionlanguage, we introduce thinking with camera. For camera understanding, we align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic terms across geometric context, enabling LMMs to predict camera parameters through structured spatial reasoning. As shown in Table 5, this design (Ours w/ Thinking) consistently improves performance, especially for pitch and FoV prediction that depend on broader contextual priors, demonstrating the frameworks ability to capture hierarchical spatial context beyond localized geometric cues. Thinking with camera also enhances camera-controllable generation: given prompt with scene descriptions and target parameters, the model infers potential spatial cues and uses them as semantic planning stage to guide synthesis. As illustrated in Figure 8 (left), it emphasizes visual cues such as ceilings under large tilt-up, yielding more accurate spatial simulation. Camera Parameters vs. Camera Map. Beyond discrete camera tokens derived from explicit numerical parameters, we further introduce continuous representation of camera geometry via pixel-wise camera maps for controllable image generation. We show the effectiveness of the precise geometric encoding provided by camera map in Figure 8 (right). Compared to numerical values of the camera parameters, the camera map encodes the local geometric context at each pixel, including orientation and spatial displacement clues, offering precise control over spatial layout and viewpoint. Without the camera map as conditions, generated images may exhibit severe geometric distortions and inverted spatial illusions under challenging camera configurations."

Additionally, it can flexibly extend to various cross-view tasks such as the spatial imagination, world exploration, and photographic guidance, by instruction tuning*. Single Task vs. Unified Training. In addition to performing multimodal tasks within unified framework, we aim to exploit the mutual benefits between understanding and generation through joint training. Unlike previous works (Pan et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025c), we jointly optimize both the LLM and the diffusion model across understanding and generation tasks. This strategy avoids the representational bottleneck imposed by frozen modules and fosters bidirectional synergy between the two tasks. As illustrated in Figure 9(a)(c), training the camera understanding component in isolation underperforms compared to the unified framework, as the generation process contributes auxiliary diffusion loss at the low-level appearance, which implicitly enhances detailed geometric perception. While the performance gain for generation is less pronounced than for understanding in Figure 9(b)(d), notable improvements emerge in challenging scenarios such as FoV simulation, which requires prior knowledge regarding precise and holistic spatial understanding within an image.

            "content": "We illustrate the versatile capabilities of our Puffin in Figure 10. Similar to previous methods (HoldGeoffroy et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2023), Puffin can support virtual 3D object insertion into in-the-wild images by accurately predicting camera parameters. Furthermore, it can be flexibly extended to range of cross-view tasks through instruction tuning, such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and photographic guidance. For both the initial and generated views in world exploration, we visualize 3D reconstruction results with VGGT (Wang et al., 2025a), showing proper spatial consistency across viewpoints. Additional results are presented in Figure A7, A8, A9."

For camera understanding, we applied central cropping followed by resizing (Section 5.2), an operation that may discard semantically valid content and degrade performance, particularly when the aspect ratio deviates significantly from unity.

            "content": "these limitations are orthogonal to our main focus, they could be addressed in future work by building multi-scale training datasets. Beyond data design, our evaluation of camera-controllable generation relied on an offline vision-based calibration method (Veicht et al., 2024). Although this approach reflects the best available practice, the calibration errors it reports can be ambiguous, especially for generated images exhibiting only subtle spatial differences. Accurately evaluating spatial simulation thus remains an open challenge and is crucial for advancing camera-controllable generation. We plan to address this by incorporating stronger camera understanding models as evaluators and by designing benchmarks that more precisely capture geometric consistency. In addition, we aim to further enhance Puffins cross-view capability and extend it to camera-centric video generation and understanding, paving the way for broader applications in dynamic and immersive environments."

            "title": "6 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "We introduce Puffin, unified multimodal model that jointly performs camera-centric understanding and generation across arbitrary viewpoints. These two tasks have been commonly treated as isolated problems and independently explored by the research community. Yet, in essence, they represent two complementary sides: decoding the geometry of the world and encoding it back into controllable, perceptually consistent visual content. Unlike previous unified models restricted to oversimplified front-view assumptions, Puffin eliminates the modality gap by interpreting the camera as language and leverages the notion of thinking with camera. We argue that unifying camera-centric understanding and generation anchors perception and synthesis to shared representation of camera geometry, allowing machines to reason about space more holistically and interactively. Such unified cameracentric model underpins robust spatial intelligence and fosters more versatile applications."

            "content": "A1.1 CAMERA PARAMETERS TO PHOTOGRAPHIC TERMS To bridge the gap between the detailed numerical values of camera parameters and the highly abstracted understanding capability learned by LMMs, we propose using professional photographic terms as intermediate supervision for our framework. Specifically, we quantize the range of each camera parameter and map them to the following photographic terms: (i) Roll: large counterclockwise Dutch angle, small counterclockwise Dutch angle, near level shot, small clockwise Dutch angle, large clockwise Dutch angle; (ii) Pitch: large tilt-down, small tilt-down, near straight-on shot, small tilt-up, large tilt-up; (iii) FoV: close-up, medium shot, wide-angle, ultra wide-angle. As quantized abstractions of camera parameters, these terms are combined with textual scene descriptions to express global spatial arrangements in linguistically accessible form. The detailed mapping relationship between the camera parameters and photographic terms is listed in Table A1. A1.2 PROMPT DESIGN FOR MULTIMODAL TASKS the basic user For text-to-image controllable generation, we use the following prompt template to format instructions: User: Generate an image: <caption>n Assistant:. The user <caption> includes both the image description and the numerical camera parameters (roll, pitch, FoV, all in radians). For camera understanding, we employ the following prompt template instruction: User: <image><question>n Assistant:. to format The <question> can be set as Describe the image in detail. Then reason its spatial distribution and estimate its camera parameters (roll, pitch, and field-of-view). For cross-view camera-controllable generation, the prompt template is formatted as: User: Generate target image given an initial view: <image><caption>n Assistant:. Here, <image> denotes the initial view token from the image tokenizer, while <caption> represents the target image description along with the target camera parameters (roll, pitch, yaw, and FoV, all in radians). During cross-view instruction tuning, we randomly set the <caption> to null with probability of 0.5, thereby enabling both text-free and text-conditioned image-to-image generation. When applying the spatial reasoning paradigm, we switch to new <question> for camera understanding: Reason the spatial distribution of this image in thinking mode, and then estimate its camera parameters (roll, pitch, and field-of-view). For generation, we first enrich the vanilla prompt using our model with the template: User: <caption><question>n Assistant:. Here, <caption> refers to"

A2 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS A2.1 CAMERA UNDERSTANDING Note that our training dataset consists of images rendered from the source panoramas in Stanford2D3D (Armeni et al., 2017). Although the sampled perspective images and camera parameters differ from those in the test set (Armeni et al., 2017), we exclude these results from the main evaluation to ensure rigor and report them in Table A2 only for reference."
