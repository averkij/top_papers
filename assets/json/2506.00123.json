            "content": "In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in computer vision [99, 91, 8, 21, 69], continually pushing the boundaries of various vision-language tasks [87, 74, 48]. The next milestone of MLLMs is generally considered to be the migration of multimodal intelligence to physical entities, i.e., robotic arm [2, 92, 46], which could naturally possess the ability to perceive the surrounding world, reason in visual space, and actively engage with the environment. This requires MLLMs to go beyond traditional multimodal understanding and incorporate both visual-spatial intelligence [98, 6, 70] and physical interaction capabilities [49, 72]. Nevertheless, existing MLLMs struggle to seamlessly incorporate these basic abilities into single unified model. notable approach is the vision-language-action (VLA) model [86, 45, 88, 10, 49, 28, 110, 9], where MLLMs are trained on large-scale robotic datasets to map multimodal observations into control policies. While effective for control tasks, the large-scale robotic learning of VLAs inevitably compromises their multimodal Equal contribution. Corresponding author. Figure 1: Overview of VeBrain and VeBrain-600k. Compared to existing MLLMs, VeBrain achieves the best trade-off performance on benchmarks of multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and robot control into one MLLM. To support the unified training of VeBrain, VeBrain-600k is built with semi-automated data engine covering variety of data sources and tasks. understanding capability [110]. To compensate for this shortcoming, some attempts [13, 76] directly construct MLLM-based agents to control robots via text descriptions while preserving their multimodal reasoning abilities. However, due to the large task gap, their control accuracy and generalizability are still far from the requirements of real robots. In this paper, we argue that the challenges of unifying these capabilities into MLLMs mainly arise from their inherent differences. Specifically, learning robot control demands precise mapping from multimodal inputs to physical motion policies in the real world, e.g., vision-language-action (VLA) models [49, 9], which fundamentally differ from the cross-modal alignment objective of existing MLLMs in 2D visual space. This distinct objective makes it difficult for MLLMs to effectively balance these capabilities, leading to knowledge forgetting and task conflicts [110]. Moreover, the community still lacks suitable data recipe to seamlessly integrate and balance these capabilities in MLLMs, further exacerbating the problem. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), unified framework for perception, reasoning, and control in real world. The core idea of VeBrain is to formulate robot control as common text-based MLLM tasks in 2D visual space, thereby unifying the learning objectives across different capabilities for MLLMs. Specifically, robot control is decomposed into the tasks of keypoint detection [31, 51] and embodied skill recognition [77]. The former serves as visual-spatial anchor encoding the movement signals of the robot, and the latter represents action commands for execution signals. Based on these control signals, we design novel robotic adapter that converts them into motion policies in dynamic and robust manner. With these designs, VeBrain can achieve efficient robot control while retaining the strong capabilities of MLLMs. Based on VeBrain, we construct high-quality instruction dataset to support the unified training, namely 2 VeBrain-600k. In addition to integrating open-source datasets, we construct an innovative semi-automated data engine that can generate task data requiring compositional capabilities. In particular, we first collect raw images and videos from public datasets and our collections, and then annotate the key information by human experts, e.g., keypoints. Finally, capabilities like perception and reasoning are embedded into these data via multimodal chain-of-thought. Through these pipelines, VeBrain-600k not only encourages MLLMs to jointly learn the basic capabilities of an embodied brain, but also maximizes its abilities in handling complex tasks. To validate VeBrain, we conduct extensive experiments on over 20 benchmarks covering multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and robot control. As shown in Fig. 1, experiments not only show the better performance of VeBrain than existing methods on multimodal tasks and spatial reasoning tasks, but also confirm its strong capabilities across diverse robotic tasks. For example, VeBrain outperforms the state-of-the-art MLLM (Qwen2.5-VL [8]) by +5.6% on MMVet [102] and achieves +0.2% averaged gains of 13 multimodal benchmarks. On legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain also demonstrates superior adaptability than all baselines, e.g., +42.9% average success rate against π0. In conclusion, our contributions are four folds: We present VeBrain, novel framework to unify multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and robotic control. VeBrain formulates robot control as two MLLM tasks in 2D visual space, i.e., keypoint detection and embodied skill recognition, thereby avoiding potential conflicts with multimodal understanding. In VeBrain, we propose novel robotic adapter that converts text-based control signals from MLLMs into the motion policies for real robots. The MLLM and the robotic adapter form closed loop and jointly accomplish robotic tasks in dynamic and robust manner. We present high-quality instruction dataset covering the basic capabilities of VeBrain, namely VeBrain600k, which is constructed by human experts and semi-automated data engines. Besides, VeBrain-600k includes large amount of carefully constructed CoT data that can significantly benefit the compositional capabilities of VeBrain. VeBrain is the first to outperform existing MLLMs in terms of the average performance on 18 multimodal and spatial benchmarks. Moreover, its generalization ability in robotic control is also confirmed on 14 tasks of legged robots and robotic arms."

            "content": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) [1, 7, 90, 93, 94, 82] has significantly propelled the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [99, 91, 8, 21, 69]. Models based on contrastive learning [84, 19, 47, 33] demonstrate strong open-world semantic alignment by matching imagetext pairs, yet are inherently limited by their lack of generative capabilities. By combining LLMs [12, 83] with vision foundation models [38, 84, 29], MLLMs exhibit exceptional performance in various vision-language tasks [62, 36, 73, 37, 87]. Concurrently, some works [3, 5, 57, 61] focus on cross-modal alignment through image-text interleaved training to boost contextual reasoning, while parallel efforts [16, 50, 68, 80, 95] pioneer spatial-aware architectures for granular region understanding. Despite many significant advances, these models mainly focus on perception and face challenges in real-world control scenarios, where embodied agents are expected to perceive and interact with physical environments [30, 77, 23, 63, 111]. While building upon Qwen2.5-VL as our pretrained backbone, we uniquely employ keypoint-based control mechanism, thus closing this critical operational gap prevalent in prior implementations."

            "content": "Previous methods for robotic policy learning predominantly relied on reinforcement learning frameworks limited to narrow skill domains [52, 35, 112, 113]. The impressive success of MLLMs, e.g., Flamingo [3], BLIP-2 [56], and LLaVA [64], has inspired the emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs). By 3 Figure 2: Illustration of VeBrain architecture and robotic adapter. In VeBrain, the MLLM is capable of perception, thinking, and decision-making in common MLLM tasks. For robot control, an additional adapter is combined with the MLLM to achieve closed-loop control of the real robot. fine-tuning on robotic interaction data, VLAs [86, 45, 88, 10, 32, 40] process visual observations and textual instructions through dedicated encoders, transforming these inputs into latent representations, which are subsequently decoded into executable action sequences. Some approaches [78, 85, 71, 89, 59] focus on the enhancement of individual components, such as pretrained visual representations, dynamics learning, and reasoning. Further studies like OpenVLA [49], RT-2 [11], QUART [28], and NaVILA [22] demonstrate how VLAs enable precise action generation across diverse platforms, including robotic manipulators and quadruped robots. Recently, long-horizon tasks have gained increasing attention, giving rise to zero-shot agents [44, 60, 30] that serve as high-level planners responsible for task decomposition. Nevertheless, existing VLAs struggle to match the understanding capabilities of MLLMs, which are significant for real-world applications."

            "content": "Previous endeavor [110] directly combines the formulation of vision-language-action (VLA) models and MLLMs, yet learning multimodal understanding and robotic control often negatively influence each other. To bridge this gap, we formulate these tasks based on three principles. Firstly, for all tasks, we adopt the task modeling with the same input-output space, i.e., p(tx, y; θ). Here, RT HW 3, RL, RN and θ denote the visual input (images or video), the textual prompt, the answer and the model parameters, respectively. Secondly, robot control is defined as common text-based MLLM task in 2D visual space, e.g., point detection [8], thus reducing the learning difficulty. Thirdly, task-specific chain-of-thoughts are designed to help the model solve challenging problems step by step. Based on these principles, we describe the task definitions below. Multimodal Understanding & Visual-Spatial Reasoning. These tasks are already well-defined in existing MLLMs, so we adopt similar task formulation accordingly. Besides, we introduce the task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) for these samples, where the MLLM is required to carefully analyze the problem and then give response. Therefore, the template of these tasks can be written as: prompt: <task description>, answer: <thinking process> <answer> , where <> denotes slot of specific textual content. Note that the thinking process is removed for easy samples. 4 Robot Control. The key challenge of robotic control lies in planning given task step by step and then executing. As shown in Fig. 2, we design the environment perception, task planning, and current decision as CoT process. The current decision is decomposed into two sub-tasks for the MLLM, namely keypoint detection and embodied skill recognition. Specifically, keypoints represent set of end locations in an image that the robot should move to or interact with, while embodied skill denotes the action to be executed after the movement, e.g., clamp. Note that the keypoints and embodied skills will be converted into executable programs via our robotic adapter."

In particular, we use the optimized vision transformer (ViT) with stride of 14 to extract visual features, where RMSNorm [105], SwiGLU [27], 2D-RoPE [8], and window attention [58] are applied for improved efficiency and capability. In particular, given the input images Rthw3 and textual prompt Rl, the MLLM architecture of VeBrain can be defined by = Fllm(tN Fv(x; θv), Ft(y), t0:N 1; θ), (1) where Rm is the next-token probability and denotes the vocabulary size. Here, Fv() denotes the ViT and the MLP, and θv is their parameters. Ft() is the textual tokenizer. Fllm() and θ are the LLM and its parameters, respectively. ti denotes the i-th predicted word.

            "content": "As defined in Sec. 3.1, there is still large gap between predictions of the MLLM and real-world deployment. Firstly, these 2D keypoints struggle to be directly applied to the real-world 3D scene. Secondly, the ego-view of legged robots changes in real time as they move, leading to the misalignment between keypoints and visual perspective. Thirdly, since the MLLM cannot perceive the robotic state, it is difficult to take control in time when unexpected situations occur. To overcome these limitations, we propose robotic adapter that consists of four modules, namely the point tracker, the movement controller, the skill executor, and the dynamic takeover. Point tracker. In legged robots, the visual perspective from the ego-view camera differs when the robot moves. Thereby, 2D keypoints should also be updated accordingly to match the new perspective. To approach this target, we introduce point tracking model, namely LocoTrack [24], where the keypoints of the current perspective are predicted in real-time manner. Movement controller. The movement controller aims to generate the movement policy for robot or robotic arm based on the 2D keypoints. Given the keypoints predicted by the MLLM, we can obtain the corresponding depth information from the RGBD camera. Then, these 2D keypoints are converted to 3D ones via simple transformation of the calibration matrix. Based on these 3D points, we estimate the movement velocity of the robot and drive the underlying movement policy model. Skill executor. Existing robots have accessed variety of skills through pre-trained policies, e.g., walking [72] and jumping [55], which are sufficient to allow the robot to interact with humans or spaces. Therefore, we collect these action policies and categorize them by name. Given the skill predicted by the MLLM, the skill executor will call the corresponding policy to accomplish the task. Dynamic takeover. In the real world, the environmental uncertainty and the mistakes of the policy model often lead to the loss of targets. In this case, dynamic takeover aims to exchange control to the MLLM when the robotic adapter fails. In particular, the takeover happens when the key points disappear from view for several frames or when subtask is done. Table 1: Ablation study of VeBrain on frameworks and data. Our baseline follows VLM-PC [13] and replaces the MLLM with Qwen2.5-VL."

Data collection and annotation. For multimodal understanding, we construct dataset with 200k conversations, including data formats of 2D images, videos, and textual descriptions. Most of the data is collected from open-source datasets, such as ShareGPT4V [17] and MMInstruct [67], etc. Another part of the data is generated by GPT4o and its CoT process is annotated by our pipeline. For visual-spatial reasoning, we collect 312k items from open-source datasets, i.e., GPT4Scene [81], and our annotated dataset. In our annotated dataset, given images from ScanNet [26], we annotate images using two pipelines: 1) combining image frames and point-cloud snapshots to generate descriptive conversations via GPT-4o; 2) labeling information of counting, object size, and object distance via annotations from ScanNet and human experts. For robot control, we collect multimodal robot dataset with 88k items from scratch, including locomotion and manipulation of legged robots and robotic arms. For data collection, 4 human experts take over 80 hours to collect video episodes and motion states of legged robots and robotic arms. Then, 5 human experts manually annotate the keypoints and actions of these episodes. Chain-of-thoughts generation. Our CoT generation aims to embed different capabilities into one conversation via CoT. For multimodal understanding and visual-spatial reasoning, CoT content aims to integrate reasoning capabilities into these tasks. Thus, we design different CoT templates according to the task properties and generate CoT content using Gemini-2.0 and GPT-4o. For robot control, the CoT process further integrates contents of perception, reasoning, and control, which firstly describes the visual observation, then decomposes the task, and finally makes the control decision. More details about CoT generation are given in our appendix. Quality verification. During the robot data collection process, three experts carefully reviewed each video to ensure that the objects were within the robots field of view. For CoT generation, we adopt cross-model validation pipeline. In particular, we employ Gemini-2.0 as the reference model to assess the logical and physical plausibility of CoT data generated by GPT-4o. Finally, we randomly select 10% of the data for manual inspection by 5 human experts, and only 5.3% of them are further excluded, demonstrating the reliability of our data generation pipeline. 6 Table 3: Comparison with existing MLLMs and VLAs on general MLLM benchmarks.

            "content": "Ablation studies. In Tab. 1, we validate the effectiveness of the data and architecture of VeBrain. From this table, the first observation is that despite the promising performance on multimodal understanding, existing MLLMs often fall short in visual-spatial reasoning and robot control, i.e., 0% success rate on the Complex Find task. After equipping the model with our robotic adapter, the success rate of Qwen2.5-VL on two robot control tasks is obviously improved. Another observation is that after fine-tuning on control data, the multimodal capabilities of VeBrain are well preserved, greatly confirming the design of VeBrain. In addition, each type of data makes significant contribution to the corresponding capabilities, e.g., +7.5% of spatial reasoning data on VSI-Bench [98]. In Tab. 2, we compare VeBrain with two common frameworks, i.e., MLLM [13] and VLA [28]. From these results, we find that MLLM struggles to directly control the robot on two tasks due to its weak control capabilities. In contrast, VLA can perform well on robot control tasks, but it greatly sacrifices multimodal abilities, e.g., -16.3% on MMVet compared to MLLM. Compared to these frameworks, VeBrain achieves the best trade-off performance on all tasks, yielding up to +31.5% average gains against other frameworks. These results not only validate the shortcomings of existing frameworks in unifying multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and robot control, but also confirm the effectiveness of each design in VeBrain. Results of multimodal understanding. In Tab. 3, we observe that existing VLA models perform inferiorly on these multimodal benchmarks, while OpenVLA completely loses the multimodal capabilities. Among them, RoboBrain [46] integrates large amount of multimodal understanding data in its training and achieves better results than other VLA models. However, compared to advanced MLLMs like Qwen2.5VL, RoboBrain obviously falls short in OCR and chart benchmarks, e.g., -6.8% on ChartQA and -187 on OCRBench. In contrast, VeBrain demonstrates the comprehensive advantages across 13 MLLM benchmarks, e.g., +6.4% against RoboBrain on DocVQA. Besides, VeBrain performs better than advanced open-source and closed-source MLLMs on most benchmarks, as proved by +5.6% on MMVet and the best normalized average performance of 77.1, suggesting its superior multimodal capabilities. Considering the much smaller 8 Table 7: Performance comparison on 7 tasks of robotic arm. All models are allowed to see 10 demonstrations per task during training.

Due to space limitations, most of the text regarding the thinking process is omitted in the figure. size of VeBrain than closed-source MLLMs, these results further confirm the strong multimodal abilities of VeBrain. Results of visual-spatial reasoning. Tab. 4 first demonstrates the results of four 3D spatial benchmarks. In this table, the models require strong 3D spatial perception and reasoning capabilities to answer different types of questions. Therefore, most previous approaches [41, 107] adopt the 3D-based MLLM structure and achieve promising results on the four benchmarks. In comparison, directly transferring 2D MLLMs to these tasks leads to poor performance, e.g., -50.1 Acc@0.25 of Qwen2.5-VL-7B [8], suggesting their shortcoming in 3D spatial understanding and reasoning. Compared to these methods, GPT4Scene-HDM [81] achieves better results via the video-based 2D MLLM and object markers. However, as specialist model, GPT4Scene-HDM struggles to be applied to common 2D multimodal tasks. In contrast, VeBrain, as generalist MLLM, can even outperform GPT4Scene-HDM on all tasks, e.g., +5.2 CIDEr on ScanQA val, greatly validating its generalizability. Tab. 5 further diagnoses the visual-spatial reasoning abilities of existing MLLMs and VeBrain. From it, we can see that VeBrain outperforms all existing MLLMs on the VSI benchmark in terms of the average score, e.g., +4.0% against the Qwen2.5-VL-7B. Compared to much larger MLLMs like GPT-4o, VeBrain can also perform even better. Considering the great challenge of the VSI benchmark, these results further confirm the spatial reasoning capabilities of VeBrain. 9 Results of robot control. In Tab 6, we compare VLA, MLLMs, and VeBrain on seven tasks of the legged robot. From it, we find that existing VLA [28] and MLLMs [79, 91, 8] have difficulty in directly accomplishing most tasks like Interaction and Transport. Among them, Qwen2.5-VL with our robotic adapter achieves the best results. However, when adapting it to harder tasks like Complex Find, their success rate drops significantly, e.g., 20% success rate. These tasks typically require compositional capabilities like spatial reasoning and embodied control, which common MLLMs are not good at. Compared to these methods, VeBrain unifies these capabilities and achieves significantly better results on various complex tasks of legged robots. For example, VeBrain outperforms all models by 50% on the long-horizon task Complex Transport. Similar merits of VeBrain can also be witnessed in the robotic arm. As shown in Tab. 7, common VLAs [49, 9] demonstrate limited success rate in most manipulation tasks, e.g., 30% success rate of π0 [9] on Move Pepper into Box. In long-horizon tasks, the success rate of π0 further drops to 0%. Compared with these methods, VeBrain achieves the highest success rate in all tasks. In the most challenging task, VeBrain outperforms π0 by up to 80%, which further validates its effectiveness in robot control."

From this figure, we see that VeBrain can handle complex robotic tasks through compositional capabilities. For example, when asked to find hidden chili pepper, VeBrain can correctly guess its potential location and then step through the steps to catch it. This requires not only control abilities, but also excellent perception and reasoning capabilities. Similar merits are also reflected in the second example, where VeBrain further determines whether the goods have been delivered to the destination."

In VeBrain, robot control is formulated as multimodal tasks of key point detection and embodied skill recognition, and novel robotic adapter is proposed to convert these signals of VeBrain to motion policies. Based on this framework, we propose the VeBrain-600k dataset to enable the learning of different capabilities. Extensive experiments on over 20 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of VeBrain than existing methods in tasks of three capabilities. In particular, VeBrain is the first to outperform the state-of-the-art MLLM in most multimodal tasks while retaining strong capabilities of spatial reasoning and robot control. Acknowledgments.

In this section, we will introduce more details of CoT data generation, including the main designs and detailed prompts. Specifically, our CoT data generation is primarily based on our annotated conversation data. Based on conversation data, we leverage diverse prompts to leverage closed-source MLLMs to generate the thinking process. key constraint during this process is that the MLLMs are prohibited from pre-revealing the answer, ensuring that the generated CoT reflects genuine reasoning. Besides, the selection of MLLMs used to annotate is also different. For visual-spatial reasoning, the input images derive from complex indoor scenes, which contain rich information. Therefore, to effectively use this information for CoT generation, we need to choose an MLLM with more creativity. Thus, for generating CoT in this task, we choose Gemini-2.0, which is more creative than GPT-4o despite being weaker in instruction following. During this process, we have some interesting observations. For instance, when assessing the distance between chair and door, Gemini 2.0 adopts practical approach. It first estimates the chairs width and then infers the distance based on how many chairs can fit between the chair and the door. In this way, these high-quality CoT data can enable VeBrain with strong spatial reasoning ability. On the other hand, GPT-4o tends to produce shorter content and relies on non-existent elements in the scene, such as floor tiles, as basis for distance judgment. In the embodied CoT generation, the complexity is significantly lower compared to 3D indoor scene video data, mainly due to the limited field of view of the robot. Therefore, we adopt more conservative strategy and used GPT-4o for CoT generation. Key designs here include requiring the MLLMs to think from the robots perspective for obstacle avoidance, interaction, tracking, grasping, and destination-reaching, among other tasks. Since our control mechanism is based on key-point policy, we visualize the key points on the input image using red circles. These marked images, combined with the QA information, are then fed into GPT-4o. This enables the robot to perform tasks such as obstacle avoidance and interaction with high degree of reliability and interpretability. We also demonstrate the detailed prompt for generating CoT data for Complex Find tasks in locomotion. In conclusion, our CoT generation strategy is tailored to the specific characteristics of visual spatial understanding and embodied scenes. By leveraging different models and data pre-processing techniques, we aim to enhance the interpretability and performance of VeBrain in real-world applications. 18 Table 9: Policies in the Policy Pool."

Data composition Our VeBrain-600k consists of 200k items from multimodal understanding, 312k items from visual-spatial reasoning, and 88k items from self-collected robotic control. Specifically, the 200k multimodal data are collected from open-source datasets, such as ShareGPT4V [17] and MMInstruct [67], etc. The 312k spatial reasoning data consists of 155k items released by GPT4Scene [81], and 157k self-collected video data generated from ScanNet [26] (We actually generate 31.4k items and repeat five times). The 88k robotic data consists of 76k from the legged robot and 12k from the robotic arm. Similarly we self-collect 15.2k and 1.2k non-redundant data items and repeat for five and ten times for the legged robot and robotic arm respectively. A.3 Low-level Policy Details Tab.9 presents all the collected actions in the policy pool, including 17 distinct implementations. With comprehensive coverage of legged robots and robot arms, this systematic organization enables robust control across different platforms. A.3.1 Legged Robot Setup. The setup for legged robots consists of Unitree Go2, RealSense D435i RGB-D camera, and Jetson AGX Orin platform. The camera is fixed at the head of Unitree Go2, providing egocentric visual perception, and calibrated to its optical center. All perception-action pipelines operate under an edge computing paradigm, utilizing the onboard computational resources, except for MLLM inference. In locomotion tasks, the visual observation varies as the legged robot moves, highlighting Point Tracker. the necessity of temporal alignment between original and current keypoints. To enhance real-time performance, we adopt series of optimizations and achieve 15Hz execution frequency for our tracker model deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin. Specifically, we employ Locotrack-small[24], lightweight yet efficient architecture enabling near-dense point tracking. The tracking model processes two consecutive observation frames while leveraging keypoint predictions from the preceding frame for temporal consistency. Low-level Controller. As described in Sec.3.2.2, the 3D coordinates for MLLM-derived keypoints in the camera frame are obtained through series of geometric transformations. These 3D coordinates are then projected into velocity control commands (vx, vy, vyaw), maintaining mathematically constrained vy relationship tan(vyaw) = . The velocity control commands are then executed by low-level walking policy vx that generates dynamically stable motion trajectories. A.3.2 Robot Arm Setup. The robot setup consists of 7-DoF tabletop Franka Emika Panda robot arm equipped with Robotiq 2F-85 gripper. RealSense D435i RGB-D camera, positioned approximately 1.5m away from the robot in third-person view, captures RGB-D scenes at each inference timestamp. The camera is calibrated 19 Table 10: Definition and skill involvement of embodied tasks. Approach the target object. Approach the target object and move along with its position.

Robot control is managed from desktop computer running ROS. Robot Control. Upon acquiring the RGB image Ic and the depth image Id captured by the camera, Ic together with prompt are fed into VeBrain to predict 2 target points, p1 and p2, which correspond to the intended antipodal grasping positions for the gripper at each inference. To determine the target pose of the robot arm, the translation component is obtained by querying the depth value at the midpoint of p1 and p2 in Id, and subsequently transforming this pixel location into the world coordinate frame. As for rotation, we adopt top-down grasping paradigm, which requires only adjusting the grippers orientation around its z-axis according to the direction defined by p1 and p2. The computed 6D end-effector pose is then passed to the MoveIt library1 for motion planning. The grippers closing width is determined by predefined force threshold. Notably, when the robot task involves opening drawer, the gripper skips the closing action. A.4 Robotic Task Details In this paper, we design hierarchical embodied tasks for both locomotion and manipulation. The definitions of each task are shown in Tab. 10. For locomotion, the Easy Tasks include three key tasks: find, track, and interaction. These tasks evaluate the basic abilities of VeBrain-equipped legged robots in static object searching, dynamic following, and human intention recognition, respectively. The Interaction task involves 1https://github.com/moveit/moveit 20 four gestures: come, sit, shake, and touch. In the Middle Tasks, we introduce obstacle avoidance into the find and interaction tasks, and add new task, transport, to assess VeBrains practical application capabilities. Finally, the Hard Locomotion Tasks involve complex transport with obstacle avoidance, further challenging the robots mobility and coordination in dynamic environments. For manipulation, we also design two levels of tasks: normal tasks and long-horizon tasks. The normal manipulation tasks include moving objects like bananas, peppers, and kiwis to specific locations, e.g., from the table to the box or outside the box, as well as pulling open half-open drawer. These tasks test the basic manipulation skills, such as grasping and releasing. The long-horizon manipulation tasks require performing multiple-step sequences, such as opening the drawer first and then moving the carrot or pepper outside of it. These tasks assess the robots ability to execute complex, multi-step actions and demonstrate precise control over its manipulation process. In our evaluation, all tasks, except for the Interaction and Complex Interaction tasks, will be tested 10 times to ensure reliability. For the Interaction task, each of the four gestures (come, sit, shake, touch) will be tested 5 times to assess the robots responsiveness and accuracy in recognizing human gestures. Moreover, the object layout in the scene will be slightly modified in each test."

            "content": "B.1 Ablation Study In Tab. 11, we further conduct ablation studies from three perspectives. 1) For the dataset proportion, our default VeBrain-600k comprises 200k from multimodal conversations, 312k from visual-spatial reasoning, and 88k from self-collected robotic dataset. We respectively increase the amount of data items for the three types of tasks, and found that the corresponding capability increases slightly but at the cost of the other two capabilities. Therefore, we maintain the original data proportion for the best trade-off among the three types of capabilities. 2) For the learning rate, we adopt the peak learning rate of 5e-6. lower learning rate, like 2e-6, results in marginal degradation across all three capabilities, while higher learning rate, such as 1e-5, leads to remarkable decline in multimodal understanding performance. 3) If we optimize VeBrain via LoRA adapter rather than fully optimize the LLM, the overall performance also shrinks slightly due to the less learnable parameters. The ablations for the above three perspectives further substantiate the superiority of training configurations in our default setting."
