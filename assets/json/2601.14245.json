            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) [4, 7, 17, 30, 42] is retrieval paradigm where query is explicitly composed by the user through reference image and modification text. CIR queries embody specific intent through the controlled composition of image and text. This not only establishes CIR as new direction in web information access, where users refine searches by combining images and text, but also links it to broader developments in retrieval-augmented agentic AI. The demand for such interaction is evident in applications such as e-commerce [6, 56] and search engines [46], where navigating massive image repositories requires fine-grained multimodal control. Compared with conventional retrieval [11, 14, 29, 43], CIR is particularly challenging because it requires cross-modal reasoning to integrate heterogeneous signals rather than relying on single unimodal cue. By pairing reference image with textual modifications, CIR moves retrieval beyond simple content matching toward retrieving images that preserve reference semantics while faithfully applying the edits. As illustrated in Figure 1, existing approaches can be broadly grouped into three categories: (a) Joint embedding-based methods project the multimodal query into vector space and formulate CIR as similarity-based matching; (b) Caption-to-Image methods first generate target caption based on the multimodal query, then embed it and compare it with candidate image embeddings in terms of similarity; and (c) Caption-to-Caption methods that directly compare candidate captions with the target caption. Despite notable progress, these approaches exhibit persistent limitations. First, joint embeddings struggle to capture fine-grained, edit-specific correspondences due to imperfect cross-modal alignment. Second, single similarity-based matching approach may fail to capture both textual and visual evidence. Third, the absence of cross-modal verification-based refinement undermines reliability, as each modality provides important information. These challenges highlight our motivation that effective CIR must fully exploit cross-modal interactions. To address these challenges, we propose XR, training-free multi-agent framework that explicitly orchestrates cross-modal reasoning, providing robust retrieval under heterogeneous signals. XR consists of three sequential modules: imagination, coarse filtering, and fine filtering. In imagination, agents construct target proxy by generating captions from two cross-modal pairings, namely modification text with the reference image caption and modification text with the reference image, which helps reduce modality gaps and anchor the target semantics. In coarse filtering, similarity-based agents evaluate candidates by producing multi-perspective scores using visual and textual cues, each conditioned on cross-modal captions. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) then aggregates these scores to form an initial ranked subset that addresses the limitations of single-criterion matching. In fine filtering, question-based agents re-evaluate this subset through cross-modal factual verification by testing candidate images and captions with predicate-style queries, which mimic how humans validate retrieval consistency. Finally, verification scores are integrated with similarity scores through re-ranking to produce the final retrieval set, benefiting from both similarity-based matching and factual verification. The similarity-based and question-based agents play complementary roles, where the former enables efficient high-level retrieval for broad coverage, while the latter enforces factual verification to refine results for accuracy. This design preserves diverse sources of evidence that single-score pipelines would otherwise overlook. Moreover, the cross-modality employed in both agents within XR enhances reliability by providing multi-perspective evidence. This is achieved through combination of implicit coupling and explicit decoupling of modalities, enabling effective integration while maintaining per-modality interpretability. The proposed framework is tailored for edit-sensitive compositionality, capturing fine-grained modifications beyond the capability of unimodal systems. We evaluate XR on three CIR benchmarks, CIRR, CIRCO, and FashionIQ, covering diverse retrieval scenarios from controlled reference-based queries to open-domain compositional settings. Across all datasets, XR consistently improves edit-sensitive retrieval accuracy over strong training-free and training-based baselines, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality. These results suggest practical value for web systems and applications, including personalized e-commerce search and multimodal recommendation. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We propose XR, training-free framework that orchestrates multiple cross-modal agents for CIR. We demonstrate the necessity of explicit cross-modality by showing its advantage over unimodal and single-score pipelines, which fail on edit-sensitive reasoning. Extensive experiments on CIRR, CIRCO, and FashionIQ show consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations substantiating each modules role, positioning XR as general paradigm for multimodal retrieval."

Recent studies on retrieval-augmented\nagents, such as Storm [21, 36] and WikiAutoGen [48] highlight the\npromise of retrieval-augmented agents, yet remain limited: Storm\nis text-centric, while WikiAutoGen extends to multimodality but\nin a narrow scope. Overall, these findings underscore retrieval as a\nkey enabler of reasoning, yet a systematic integration into general\nmultimodal agents remains missing.\nComposed Image Retrieval: CIR provides a natural testbed for\nretrieval-enhanced reasoning, where the task is to locate a target im-\nage given a reference image and textual modifications [39, 54].

Training-based models enhance representations but demand costly supervision and frequent retraining [3, 5, 18, 47]. Training-free approaches avoid task-specific supervision and generalize across domains. However, they rely on static fusion and one-shot pipelines, with little flexibility to refine uncertain retrieval results (e.g., candidate images or captions) [8, 24, 25]. Reasoning-style retrieval has been explored [13, 40, 41], but existing methods remain fixed templates rather than adaptive workflows. In practice, models still fail on fine-grained edits, for example, misinterpreting color changes in FashionIQ or mismatching object replacements in CIRR, underscoring the persistent limits of static similarity matching. This indicates that static similarity is not only brittle to edits but also fundamentally unable to capture compositional semantics. In short, multimodal agents excel at reasoning but underexploit retrieval, while CIR methods leverage retrieval but lack reasoning, leaving the two largely disconnected. XR bridges this gap by embedding retrieval within an agentic workflow: (1) imagination agents approximate the target image, preserving fine-grained details often missed by embeddings; (2) similarity-based agents score candidates across modalities, reducing the rigidity of one-shot pipelines; (3) question-based agents enforce factual checks, ensuring textual modifications are faithfully satisfied. Unified in training-free system, these components elevate retrieval into dynamic reasoning, addressing the above limitations and yielding results that are both faithful to user intent and verifiable across modalities."

            "content": "In the fine filtering stage, question-based scoring agents perform factual verification to further filter and refine this subset, producing the final ordered set I. These two components complement each other, working together to progressively narrow down candidates and improve ranking. Throughout the process, cross-modal mechanisms offer multi-perspective support that enhances robustness and reliability in retrieval while reducing the risks associated with multimodal misalignment. 𝑡 and the vision imagination agent A𝑖 The workflow of XR is outlined in Algorithm 1 and depicted in Figure 1. The caption agent A𝑐 generates set of candidate captions by iteratively producing caption for each 𝐼 (Line 1). It also generates the caption 𝐶𝑟 for the reference image 𝐼𝑟 (Line 2). To construct or imagine the ideal target image 𝐼𝑖 , the text imagination agent A𝑖 𝑣 jointly form the cross-modal imagination module. These two agents generate captions 𝐶𝑡 and 𝐶𝑣, respectively, to describe 𝐼𝑖 from different modalities. In addition, A𝑖 𝑡 produces 𝑀𝑡 , which specifies the manipulations required to transform 𝐶𝑟 with 𝑇𝑚 in order to approximate 𝐼𝑖 , thereby unifying the information in the text modality. Meanwhile, 𝑀𝑣 denotes set indicating the presence or absence of visual attributes. In coarse filtering, to evaluate each candidate image 𝐼 , XR employs text similarity-based scoring agent A𝑠 𝑡 (Line 6) and vision similarity-based scoring agent A𝑠 𝑣 (Line 7). These agents assess the 𝑎-th candidate from different modalities, using 𝐶𝑎 and 𝐼𝑎 respectively, conditioned on 𝐶𝑡 and 𝐶𝑣. Each scoring agent produces two scores, denoted 𝑠𝑡 and 𝑠 𝑣, through process termed cross-modal multiperspective scoring, which operates within the embedding space based on similarity. The text-based score 𝑠𝑡 and vision-based score 𝑠 𝑣 are then aggregated across agents in Lines 8 and 9. In Line 10, the score vectors 𝑆𝑡 = {𝑠𝑡 𝑁 } 1 are processed separately using Reciprocal Rank Fusion function. The resulting rank scores are combined, after which candidates are ranked and filtered to yield the top-𝑘 results, denoted by I𝑘 𝑁 } and 𝑆 𝑣 = {𝑠 𝑣 1 , . . . , 𝑠 𝑣 , . . . , 𝑠𝑡 . To enhance the ranking accuracy of the selected top-𝑘 candidates and further refine this subset, XR incorporates cross-modal question-based scoring agents in the fine filtering stage. The question agent A𝑞 (Line 11) formulates set of questions 𝑄 with corresponding answers 𝐴 based on the information 𝑀𝑡 , 𝑀𝑣, and 𝑇𝑚, focusing on the essential attributes that the ideal target image 𝐼𝑖 should contain. Unlike the similarity-based scoring agents, A𝑞 emphasizes the critical differences between candidate image 𝐼 𝑞 and the ideal target 𝐼𝑖 . Two question-based scoring agents, 𝑡 and 𝑞 𝑣 , then use 𝑄 and 𝐴 to re-evaluate candidates in I𝑘 from the text and vision modalities, applying 𝐶𝑎 and 𝐼𝑎 respectively (Lines 1314). Finally, the scores from the question-based scoring agents are combined with the aggregated similarity-based scores through cross-modal re-ranking function (Line 15). The candidates are then re-ordered based on the resulting scores to form the fine-filtered subset, which constitutes the final output of size 𝑘, where 𝑘 < 𝑘 . The following paragraphs describe in detail the roles of imagination, coarse filtering, and fine filtering."

This prior knowledge is critical, as incorrect priors can trigger cascade of errors. To address this, the agents A𝑖 𝑡 and A𝑖 𝑣 are designed to imagine and approximate the ideal target 𝑡 take different inputs: A𝑖 image by generating cross-modal captions that capture complementary aspects of 𝐼𝑖 . The cross-modality arises from the fact that A𝑖 𝑣 and A𝑖 𝑣 uses the reference image 𝐼𝑟 and A𝑖 𝑡 uses the reference caption 𝐶𝑟 , and both are conditioned on the modification text 𝑇𝑚. Their outputs are the vision-based caption 𝐶𝑣 and the text-based caption 𝐶𝑡 , respectively. The design of cross-modal imagination is motivated by the observation that information from different modalities provides complementary strengths and weaknesses when estimating 𝐼𝑖 . Specifically, the pair (𝑇𝑚, 𝐶𝑟 ) is more straightforward, which facilitates the extraction of key information for depicting 𝐼𝑖 . In contrast, the pair (𝑇𝑚, 𝐼𝑟 ) combines textual and visual inputs, where the image contributes fine-grained details that complement the textual description. We argue that combining both perspectives enables the model to adapt flexibly to diverse situations encountered in real-world retrieval tasks. As shown in Figure 2, in cross-modal imagination, 𝐶𝑣 and 𝐶𝑡 generate captions that are similar but not identical. The former captures fine-grained visual details, such as outdoors and multiple medium dogs, which are grounded in the image. The latter, by contrast, emphasizes semantic transformation, for example transformed from several smaller dogs, reflecting more abstract and text-driven perspective rather than visually specific cues. Additionally, A𝑖 𝑡 is designed to output 𝑀𝑡 , which represents the modifications between 𝑇𝑚 and 𝐶𝑟 . While 𝑇𝑚 is provided by the user or predefined to describe changes in the text modality that are applied to the visual modality, 𝑀𝑡 is derived entirely from the text modality and provides more specific and explicit modifications. At the same time, A𝑖 𝑣 produces 𝑀𝑣, which denotes set indicating the presence or absence of visual attributes. The example of 𝑀𝑣 and 𝑀𝑡 can be found in Figure 2. The outputs 𝑀𝑡 and 𝑀𝑣 will later be used by the question agent, which will be discussed in detail in subsequent section.

Although both 𝐶𝑡 and 𝐶𝑣 are textual representations, they are derived from different modalities: the text modality and the vision modality, respectively. Second, each candidate image indexed by 𝑎 {1, . . . , 𝑁 } is also evaluated with respect to its caption 𝐶𝑎 and its visual content 𝐼𝑎 by A𝑠 𝑣, respectively. Third, each scoring agent produces two cross-modal scores. In Line 6, the scores 𝑠𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 are generated by the text similarity-based scoring agent A𝑠 and 𝑠 𝑣 𝑡 . Specifically, 𝑠𝑡 𝑡 measures the similarity between 𝐶𝑡 and 𝐶𝑎, while 𝑠 𝑣 𝑡 measures the similarity between 𝐶𝑣 and 𝐶𝑎. Since 𝐶𝑡 originates from the text modality and 𝐶𝑣 implicitly reflects visual content, these two scores capture cross-modal signals that combine implicitly coupled and explicitly decoupled multimodality. Here, explicitly decoupled multimodality refers to processing that occurs entirely within the text modality, whereas implicit coupling indicates that visual information is embedded within the textual representation. The same procedure is applied by the vision similarity-based scoring agent A𝑠 𝑣 measure the similarity between 𝐼𝑎 and 𝐶𝑡 , and between 𝐼𝑎 and 𝐶𝑣, respectively. Here, the pair (𝐼𝑎, 𝐶𝑣) belongs to the visual modality, whereas the pair (𝐼𝑎, 𝐶𝑡 ) combines the vision and text modalities. These procedures are collectively referred to as cross-modal scoring. Each score is generated by its corresponding agent, which encodes the inputs using an MLLM and computes the cosine similarity between the paired representations. In Lines 8 and 9, for each candidate 𝐼 , the scores from the text and vision modalities across agents are summed to obtain 𝑠𝑡 and 𝑠 𝑣, respectively. Rather than aggregating the outputs of single agent, the scores are aligned within each modality to ensure consistency 𝑣. In Line 7, the scores 𝑠𝑡 𝑣 and 𝑠 𝑣 in cross-modal scoring. In Line 10, reciprocal rank fusion function is applied to transform the similarity score vectors 𝑆𝑡 = (𝑠𝑡 𝑁 ) 1 and 𝑆 𝑣 = (𝑠 𝑣 𝑁 ) into rank values, which are then summed 1 across the text and vision modalities. The ranking function is defined as: , . . . , 𝑠 𝑣 , . . . , 𝑠𝑡 RRF (𝑎) = 1 𝑧 + rank (cid:0)𝑠𝑡 𝑎 (cid:1) + 1 𝑧 + rank (𝑠 𝑣 𝑎) , (1) 𝑎) and rank(𝑠 𝑣 𝑎 and the vision-based score 𝑠 𝑣 where rank(𝑠𝑡 𝑎) denote the rank positions of the textbased score 𝑠𝑡 𝑎 among all candidates, respectively, and 𝑧 is smoothing constant. This formulation ensures that higher-ranked candidates in either modality contribute more to the final score, while still incorporating signals from both modalities. Finally, the top-𝑘 candidates I𝑘 are selected and passed to the next stage for fine filtering, balancing retrieval accuracy with computational cost. If 𝑘 = 𝑁 , then all candidates are selected and proceed to the next step. Notably, the process of producing and aggregating multiple scores is also inspired by human cognitive mechanisms. When humans search for target images, cross-modal information is interwoven in the mind, collectively forming unified body of evidence that supports decision-making."

However, in real-world scenarios, ensuring retrieval accuracy often requires factual verification with semanic reasoning. To address this, we introduce the question agent A𝑞 (Line 11).

All questions are formulated in True/False format, with examples provided in Figure 2. In Lines 13 and 14, 𝑞 𝑣 are two question-based scoring agents that use 𝑄 to evaluate each candidate image 𝑎 {1, . . . , 𝑘 } based on different modality information, namely 𝐶𝑎 and 𝐼𝑎. We consider fact to be true if the candidate is able to pass the verification check under both modalities. If the answer to question is correct, the agent assigns score of +1; otherwise, the score is 0. The results are denoted as 𝑠𝑡 𝑞. We consider this design to be effective because it provides discrete, verifiable signals that emphasize factual consistency across modalities. 𝑞 and 𝑠 𝑣 𝑞 = 𝑆 𝑣 𝑞, and 𝑆𝑡 In Lines 15 and 16, we define the cross-modal re-ranking procedure for the top-𝑘 previously selected candidates. For notational simplicity, we omit the index 𝑘 here. First, the question-based scores for each candidate are summed as 𝑆𝑡 𝑞 𝑆𝑡 𝑞, 𝑠 𝑣 𝑞 𝑆 𝑣 𝑞 = 𝑘 . This sum is then multiplied by normalized weighted combination of the similarity-based scores 𝑆𝑡 and 𝑆 𝑣 from Lines 8 and 9, with weights 𝜆 and 1 𝜆, respectively. It is worth noting that only the similarity-based scores 𝑆𝑡 and 𝑆 𝑣 of the top-𝑘 candidates are used at this stage. The result, denoted 𝑆𝑘 , represents the refined scores used for re-ranking in Line 16. Finally, the re-ranked set is returned as the final output. 𝑞, where 𝑠𝑡 𝑞 + 𝑆 𝑣 This design is motivated by the complementary strengths of the two scoring mechanisms. Similarity-based scores (𝑆𝑡 and 𝑆 𝑣) capture soft alignment between the candidate images and the multimodal query, but they may overlook fine-grained factual details. In contrast, question-based scores (𝑆𝑡 𝑞) enforce explicit verification of atomic modifications and provide binary, interpretable signals. By combining the two, the re-ranking step integrates the broad cross-modal coverage of similarity-based scoring with the precision of question-based verification, thereby improving robustness 𝑞 and 𝑆 𝑣 Shirt Dress Toptee Avg.

In fact, the use of XR is flexible. So far, we have discussed how similarity-based scoring and question-based scoring collaborate through ranking (selection) and re-ranking (re-selection). Moreover, when 𝑘 = 𝑘, the two scoring processes act as rankingselection and re-ranking. When 𝑘 = 𝑁 , the two processes operate jointly, performing ranking and selection directly. It is important to note that these three configurations correspond to increasing computational cost. In summary, we propose XR, training-free cross-modal multiagent framework for CIR. The framework highlights the benefits of agentic AI, including minimal human intervention and autonomous collaboration among multiple agents that mimic human cognitive processes. By enabling retrieval that is both robust and adaptive across modalities, XR points toward promising directions for largescale information access scenarios that are becoming increasingly central in web-driven environments."

We set the temperature = 0 and top-𝑝 = 1 for deterministic outputs. The fusion weight is 𝜆 = 0.15 to balance textimage similarity. We set 𝑘 = 100 candidates for fine filtering to allow question-based scoring to take effect. If 𝑘 were set equal to 𝑘, as in Recall@k, the benefit of re-ranking would be masked since Recall@k is orderinsensitive. In contrast, fine filtering both re-ranks and prunes candidates, making 𝑘 = 100 balanced choice. All experiments are conducted on single NVIDIA H800-80G GPU with FP16 precision."

Figure 4: Effect of 𝜆 on textimage fusion: best at 𝜆=0.15; extremes degrade by losing cross-modal cues. This suggests that XR benefits most from medium-scale MLLMs, which balance expressiveness and efficiency and indicate that the framework scales smoothly across backbones. Number of questions. Figure 3(c) shows that single verification question is insufficient, while three yield consistent gains across benchmarks (e.g., CIRR R@10 = 82.84%). Using more than three slightly reduces performance, as redundant checks add overhead without new information. These results indicate that small, diverse set of questions suffices for robust factual alignment, consistent with the principle that each agent contributes distinct value. Top-𝑘 analysis. Figure 3(d) illustrates the impact of the coarse filtering pool size. Small 𝑘 limits recall, while larger pools improve coverage by ensuring candidate diversity. Gains plateau beyond 𝑘 = 100, with only marginal improvements up to 𝑘 = 500. This indicates that moderately large pools provide the best efficiencyeffectiveness balance. Effect of 𝜆. Figure 4 examines the balance between textual and visual similarity signals. Relying solely on either modality (𝜆 = 0 or 𝜆 = 1) significantly degrades performance, as it ignores complementary cues. The best results occur at 𝜆 = 0.15, suggesting that cross-modal fusion is most effective when neither modality dominates, validating the principle of balanced agent collaboration. Latency analysis. Figure 5 shows average and total latency under different candidate pool sizes (𝑘 ). As expected, larger 𝑘 increases cost as more candidates enter fine filtering. Per-query latency grows nearly linearly, with CIRCO highest due to its many distractors. Total latency is dominated by CIRR because of its dataset scale, while (a) Average latency per query. (b) Total latency. Figure 5: Latency of XR under different top-𝑘 : larger pools increase cost nearly linearly, but 𝑘 100 balances coverage and overhead. FashionIQ remains relatively lightweight. Overall, moderately large 𝑘 (around 100) offers the best trade-off, balancing diversity for robust retrieval against computational overhead. These results highlight that the strength of XR comes from orchestrating multiple agents rather than relying on any single component. By uniting semantic alignment with factual verification, cross-modal reasoning refines retrieval and overcomes the inherent limits of unimodal pipelines. More broadly, this shows that cross-modal multi-agent reasoning is not only effective for CIR but establishes general paradigm for multimodal retrieval and reasoning."

While the main paper reports the representative metrics (R@10 and R@50), here we include the full set of scores across different categories (shirts, dresses, and tops) and wider range of evaluation metrics. These results further demonstrate the consistent advantages of our crossmodal framework over single-modality baselines."

To assess statistical significance, we perform paired one-sided 𝑡-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The null hypothesis (H0) states that XR performs equally or worse than the baseline, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) states that our method performs better. As shown in Table B.1, XR achieves the highest mean score (57.16 0.07), compared to CIReVL (49.06 0.23), ImageScope (37.99 0.25), and the Raw baseline (29.62 0.11). All comparisons yield 𝑝-values well below the threshold 𝛼 = 0.05 (e.g., 𝑡-test: 3.94 1017 against CIReVL), thereby allowing us to confidently reject H0 in favor of H1. These results confirm that XR consistently and significantly outperforms all baselines."

            "content": ". To promote transparency and ensure the reproducibility of our work, we will release all experimental code, datasets, and detailed tutorials necessary for replicating our experiments. Our goal is to make it straightforward for researchers and practitioners to reproduce our results, regardless of their technical background. Additionally, by providing comprehensive documentation and clear guidelines, we aim to facilitate the extension of our method to other models and architectures, enabling the broader research community to explore its potential applications and improvements. We believe that open and reproducible research is essential for advancing the field and fostering collaboration. Limitations and Future Work While XR achieves strong results on CIR benchmarks, several limitations remain. The framework is currently tailored to imagetext composition and has not yet been explored in settings involving richer modalities or temporal data. Its reliance on captions and verification questions generated by large models can also introduce subtle biases, which may affect consistency. Moreover, scaling to very large candidate pools requires further optimization of efficiency. Looking ahead, we envision cross-modal reasoning as the key avenue for progress. Extending XR beyond images and text to modalities such as video, audio, or interactive queries would open new opportunities for retrieval systems. Developing more lightweight and adaptive agents, together with diverse verification signals, could further enhance both robustness and scalability. These directions highlight the potential of cross-modal multi-agent reasoning as general paradigm for future multimodal search.

XR captures subtle attribute edits (e.g., tone, lettering) and validates them via text-based questioning. Target image is marked with the green box. Figure F.3: Case study on CIRCO. XR remains robust under distractor-heavy settings by verifying entity-level edits (e.g., food type, clothing). Target image is marked with the green box. on CIRR, it grounds complex scene edits through factual verification; on FashionIQ, it captures subtle attribute modifications such as color or lettering; and on CIRCO, it remains robust under distractorheavy settings where static similarity often fails.
