            "content": "Luo and Yang et al. If have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Isaac Newton The scientific research pipeline is testament to the achievements of the Enlightenment in systematic inquiry [17, 58, 58]. In this traditional paradigm, scientific research involves series of well-defined steps: researchers start by gathering background knowledge, propose hypotheses, design and execute experiments, collect and analyze data, and finally report findings through manuscript that undergoes peer review. This cyclical process has led to groundbreaking advancements in modern science and technology, yet it remains constrained by the creativity, expertise, and finite time and resources available inherent to human researchers. For decades, the scientific community has sought to enhance this process by automating aspects of scientific research, aiming to increase the productivity of scientists. Early computer-assisted research can date back to the 1970s, introducing systems such as Automated Mathematician [74, 75] and BACON [71], which showed the potential of machines to assist in specialized research tasks like theorem generation and empirical law identification. More recently, systems such as AlphaFold [62] and OpenFold [4] have exemplified pioneering efforts to automate specific research tasks, significantly speeding up scientific progress in their respective domains by thousands of times. Yet it was only with the advent of foundation models and the recent explosion in Large Language Models (LLMs) [2, 154] that the vision of comprehensive AI assistance across multiple research domains became realistic [190]. The recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in LLMs, transforming various fields of AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models, such as GPT-4 [2] and LLaMA [154], have set new benchmarks in understanding, generating and interacting with human language. Their capabilities, enhanced by massive datasets and innovative architectures, now extend beyond conventional NLP tasks to more complex and domain-specific challenges. In particular, the ability of LLMs to process massive amounts of data, generate human-like text, and assist in complex decision-making has captured significant attention in the scientific community [92, 141]. These breakthroughs suggest that LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the way scientific research is conducted, documented, and evaluated [156, 165, 174]. In this survey, we explore how LLMs are currently being applied across various stages of the scientific research process. Specifically, we identify four general tasks where LLMs have demonstrated notable potential. We begin by exploring their application in scientific hypothesis discovery, where LLMs leverage existing knowledge and experimental observations to suggest novel research ideas. This is followed by review of their contributions to experiment planning and implementation, where LLMs aid in optimizing experimental design, automating workflows, and analyzing data. We also cover their use in scientific writing, including the generation of citations, related work sections, and even drafting entire papers. Finally, we discuss their potential in peer review, where LLMs support the evaluation of scientific papers by offering automated reviews and identifying errors or inconsistencies. For each of these tasks, we provide comprehensive review of the methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation methods. Moreover, the survey identifies the limitations of each task and highlights areas needing improvement. By analyzing the various stages of the research cycle where LLMs contribute, this survey can inspire researchers to explore emerging concepts, develop evaluation metrics, and design innovative approaches to integrate LLMs into their workflows effectively. Comparison with Existing Surveys. This survey provides broader and more comprehensive perspective on the applications of LLMs across the entire scientific research cycle compared to prior specialized studies. For example, Zhang et al. [187] review over 260 LLMs in scientific discovery Preprint.

The main content flow and categorization of this survey. across various disciplines, focusing primarily on technical aspects such as model architectures and datasets, without situating their roles within the broader context of the research process. Similarly, other surveys tend to adopt narrower scopes, examining specific capabilities of LLMs for general applications, such as planning [55] or automation [158], rather than their focused utility in scientific research workflows. Additionally, some works address general approaches relevant to specific research stages but are not exclusively centered on LLMs, such as related work and citation text Preprint. Luo and Yang et al. generation [89] or peer review processes [33]. In contrast, this survey integrates these fragmented perspectives, providing holistic analysis of LLMs contributions across the scientific workflow and highlighting their potential to address the diverse and evolving demands of modern research. Organization of this Survey. As illustrated in Figure 2, the structure of this survey is as follows: 2 covers LLMs for scientific hypothesis discovery, including an overview of methodologies and key challenges. 3 focuses on experiment planning and implementation, highlighting how LLMs can optimize and automate these processes. 4 delves into automated paper writing, including citation and related work generation, while 5 explores LLM-assisted peer review. For each topic, the survey concludes with summary of current challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field."

            "title": "2.2 History of Scientific Discovery\nUsing LLMs to generate novel scientific hypotheses is a new research topic, mostly originating from\ntwo related research domains, which are “literature-based discovery” and “inductive reasoning”.",
            "content": "Literature-based Discovery. Literature-based discovery (LBD) was first proposed by Swanson 2.2.1 [151]. The central idea is that knowledge can be public, yet undiscovered, if independently created fragments are logically related but never retrieved, brought together, and interpreted. Therefore, how to retrieve public knowledge that can be brought together to create new knowledge remains challenge. Swanson [151] propose classic formalization of LBD, which is the ABC model where two concepts and are hypothesized as linked if they both co-occur with some intermediate concept in papers. More recent work has used word vectors [155] or link prediction models [152, 160, 171] to discover links between concepts to compose hypotheses. However, classic LBD methods do not model contexts that human scientists consider in the ideation process, and are limited to predicting pairwise relations between discrete concepts [47]. To overcome these limitations, Wang et al. [159] make the first attempt to ground LBD in natural language context to constrain the generation space, and also use generated sentences as output instead of only predicting relations as in the traditional LBD. Another limitation of LBD is that it has long been thought of as only be applicable to very specific, narrow type of hypothesis [159]. However, recent progress in scientific discovery indicates that LBD might have much wider applicable scope. Particularly, Yang et al. [174] and Yang et al. [176] discuss extensively with social science and chemistry researchers correspondingly, and find that most existing social science and chemistry published hypotheses (instead of only narrow type of hypotheses) can be formulated in LBD pattern. It probably indicates that future hypotheses in social science and chemistry to be published can also result from (correct) linkages and associations of existing knowledge. Inductive Reasoning. Inductive reasoning is about finding general rule or hypothesis 2.2.2 that has wide application scope from specific observations [175]. For example, Geocentrism, Preprint. LLM4SR: Survey on Large Language Models for Scientific Research 5 Heliocentricism, and Newtons Law of Gravity are all proposed rules based on the observations of the movements of stars and planets. Scientific discovery is difficult task of inductive reasoning to an extreme, where each rule is novel scientific finding. The philosophy of science community has summarized three fundamental requirements for rule from inductive reasoning [113], which are (1) rule should not be in conflict with observations; (2) rule should reflect the reality; (3) rule should present general pattern that can be applied to larger scope than the specific observations, covering new information not existing in the observations. Previously inductive reasoning research is mainly conducted by the inductive logic programming community [26], which uses formal language and symbolic reasoners. Yang et al. [173] first work on generative inductive reasoning in the NLP domain, which is to generate natural language rules from specific natural language observations with language models, introducing the requirements on inductive reasoning from the philosophy of science community. Motivated by the empirical experience that language models tend to generate vague and not specific rules, they additionally propose the fourth requirement: (4) rule should be clear and in enough detail. The fourth requirement might have been overlooked by the philosophy of science community since its too obvious. Motivated by the requirements, Yang et al. [173] design an overly-generation-thenfiltering mechanism, leveraging language models to first generate many preliminary rules and then filter those do not satisfy the requirements. Then methods are developed to use self-refine to replace filtering and use more reasoning steps for better rules [120, 163, 191, 194]. However, the rules this line of works try to induce are either known knowledge, or not scientific knowledge but synthesized patterns. Yang et al. [174] make the first attempt to extend the classic inductive reasoning task setting (to discover known/synthetic knowledge) into real scientific discovery setting: to leverage LLMs to autonomously discover novel and valid social science scientific hypotheses from the publicly available web data. Specifically, they collect news, business reviews, and Wikipedia pages on social science concepts as the web data to discover hypothesis. Majumder et al. [107, 108] further propose the concept of data-driven discovery, which is to discover hypotheses across disciplines with all the public experimental data on the web (and private experimental data at hand). Their motivation is that the potential of the large amount of publicly available experimental data has not been fully exploited that lots of novel scientific hypotheses could be discovered from the existing data."

            "title": "2.3.1 Main Trajectory. In general, this method development trajectory for scientific discovery\ncan be seen as incorporating more key components into the methods.

            "content": "Preprint. 6 Luo and Yang et al. Inspiration Retrieval Strategy. In addition to relying on background knowledge, literature-based discovery (LBD) facilitates the retrieval of additional knowledge as source of inspiration for formulating new hypotheses. SciMON [159] first introduces the concepts of LBD to the discovery task, demonstrating that new knowledge can be composed of linkage of existing knowledge. It is vital that the inspiration should not be known to be related to the background before, or at least should not be used to associate with the background in known way [176]. Otherwise, the hypothesis would not be novel. Inspired by the ABC model in classic LBD formalization, given background knowledge, SciMON retrieves semantically similar knowledge, knowledge graph neighbors, and citation graph neighbors as inspirations. Specifically, two knowledge are identified as semantically similar if their embeddings from SentenceBERT [127] have high cosine similarity; The knowledge graph they built follows [method, used-for, task] format. ResearchAgent strictly follows the ABC model by constructing concept graph, where link represents the two connected concept nodes have appeared in the same paper before. It retrieves inspiration concepts that are connected with the background concepts on the concept graph (concept co-occurence). Scideator retrieves inspiration papers based on semantic matching (semantic scholar API recommendations) and concept matching (papers containing similar concepts in the same topic, same subarea, and different subarea). SciPIP [164] retrieves inspirations from semantically similar knowledge (based on SentenceBERT), concept co-occurence, and citation graph neigbors. It proposes filtering methods to filter not useful concepts for concept co-occurence retrieval. Different from selecting semantic or citation neighbors as inspirations, SciAgents randomly sample another concept that is connected with the background concept in citation graph (via long or short path) as the inspiration. MOOSE [174] proposes to use LLM-selected inspirations: given the research background and some inspiration candidates in the context, and ask an LLM to select inspirations for the research background from the candidates. Then MOOSE-Chem [176] also adopts it. MOOSE-Chem assumes that after training on hundreds of millions of scientific papers, the most advanced LLMs might already have certain level of ability to identify the inspiration knowledge for the background to compose novel discovery of knowledge. MOOSE-Chem analyzes this assumption by annotating 51 chemistry papers published in 2024 (which are only available online in 2024) with their background, inspirations, and hypothesis, and see whether LLMs with training data up to 2023 can retrieve the annotated inspirations given only the background. Their results show very high retrieval rate, indicating that the assumption could be largely correct. Then Nova also adopts LLM-selected inspirations, with the motivation that leveraging the LLMs internal knowledge to determine useful knowledge for new ideas should be able to surpass traditional entity or keyword-based retrieval methods. Feedback Modules. The next key component is the iterative feedback on the generated hypotheses in the aspects of novelty, validity, and clarity. These three feedbacks are first proposed by MOOSE, motivated by the requirements for hypothesis in inductive reasoning [113, 173]. These three aspects are objective enough to give feedback, and each of them is essential for good hypothesis. Novelty Checker. The generated hypotheses should be novel finding compared to the existing literature. When hypothesis tends to be similar to an existing hypothesis, feedback on enhancing its novelty could be beneficial for hypothesis formulation. Existing methods for novelty feedback are all based on LLMs. In general, there are three ways to provide novelty feedback. The first method evaluates each generated hypothesis against related survey (MOOSE); the second iteratively retrieves relevant papers for comparison (SciMON, Preprint. LLM4SR: Survey on Large Language Models for Scientific Research Table 1. Discovery Methods.

Validity Checker. The generated hypotheses should be valid science/engineering findings that precisely reflect the objective universe [113]. real validity feedback should be from the results of experiments. However, it is time-consuming and costly to conduct experiments for each generated hypothesis. Therefore, currently, validity feedback almost entirely relies on the heuristics of LLMs or other trained neural models. The exceptions are FunSearch, HypoGeniC, LLM-SR, and SGA. Specifically, FunSearch is about generating code for math problems. The compiler and verification code are naturally efficient and effective verifiers; HypoGeniC and LLM-SR focus on data-driven discovery, which means they have access to observation examples that can be used to check consistency with each generated hypothesis; SGA creates virtual physical simulation environment to mimic real experiments. However, validity checker is still significant challenge for the scientific discovery community. Future research directions include robotics and automation labs, which could automatically perform wet-lab experiments (e.g., biology and chemistry experiments) to verify the generated hypotheses. For computer science-related hypotheses, the future research direction could be more advanced systems for automatic code implementation. Clarity Checker. The generated hypotheses should be sufficiently clear in conveying information and provide adequate details [173]. However, LLMs tend to generate hypotheses with insufficient details [159]. Therefore, it would be beneficial to provide feedback in terms of clarity to refine the hypothesis and expand it with details [174]. Current methods (MOOSE, ResearchAgent, MOOSE-Chem, and VirSci) all adopt LLMs to provide self-assessment on clarity. Preprint. 8 Luo and Yang et al. Evolutionary Algorithm. Evolutionary Algorithm is subset of optimization algorithms inspired by the principles of biological evolution. It assumes the existence of an environment, where an entity that cant adapt to it would be eliminated, and super entity would be evolved from the recombination of characteristics between entities that have some adaptability to the environment (this process is also called as mutation). This key component is important since (1) the real experiment evaluation and the heuristic evaluation of the generated hypotheses naturally serve as the environment. (2) the essence of scientific hypothesis discovery fundamentally can be seen as mutation to unknown yet valid knowledge from only known knowledge input. Although with similar goals, current scientific discovery methods leverage the evolutionary algorithm in different ways. FunSearch first introduced the evolutionary algorithm to the scientific discovery task. They adopt an island-based evolutionary algorithm, where each island is group of similar methods, and each island keeps mutating to new hypotheses. At some time intervals, some least ranking islands are eliminated, and new islands consisting of the best-performing hypotheses from every island are formed, encouraging the recombination between merits between islands. LLM-SR adopts similar island-based evolutionary algorithm. SGA leverages it as evolutionary search, which is to generate multiple offspring in each iteration and retain the best selection. They also adopt an evolutionary crossover, where LLMs generate new hypotheses from various past experiments for better exploration. MOOSE-Chem designs it as an evolutionary unit, to better associate background knowledge and inspiration knowledge. Specifically, given background and inspiration knowledge, they first generate multiple unique hypotheses to associate the two. Each hypothesis is then independently refined, and finally, the refined hypotheses are recombined to better integrate the background and inspiration knowledge into cohesive hypothesis. It encourages different mutation variants from the same input and gathers the advantages from each mutation variant. Leveraging Multiple Inspirations. Here the Leveraging Multiple Inspirations (LMI) component we discuss is about clear identification of several inspirations, so that these identified inspirations will be all leveraged into the final hypothesis (e.g., in sequential way). It is important, where different methods have different reasons. MOOSE-Chem is the first to introduce this component, motivated by the observation that many disciplines such as chemistry and material science often require multiple inspirations to formulate complete and publishable hypothesis. Specifically, they decompose the seemingly impossible-to-solve question 𝑃 (hypothesisresearch background) into many smaller, more practical and executable steps. They do it by formulating mathematical proof for the decomposition. In general, the smaller steps involve identifying starting inspiration, composing preliminary hypothesis based on the background and inspiration, finding another inspiration to address gaps in the preliminary hypothesis, then composing an updated hypothesis with the new inspiration, and so on. Their goal by utilizing multiple inspirations is to rediscover hypotheses in chemistry and material science that are published in high-impact journals such as Nature or Science. In addition to MOOSE-Chem, Nova also retrieves multiple inspirations in successive way, but with different goal, which is to generate more diverse and novel research hypotheses. Their motivation stems from IGAs experimental results that the diversity of generated hypotheses tends to saturate. They identify one of the main reasons as that the input background information is the same, whereas incorporating different sets of inspirations can largely alleviate this issue by introducing flexible inputs. Ranking of Hypotheses. This key component is about providing full ranking of the generated hypotheses. It is important because LLMs can generate large number of hypotheses in short Preprint. LLM4SR: Survey on Large Language Models for Scientific Research 9 time, while real lab experiments to verify each of them are time-consuming and costly. As result, it would be very beneficial for scientists to know which hypothesis should be tested first. Some methods (e.g., MOOSE) adopt an automatic evaluation method to provide preliminary understanding of generated hypotheses. The automatic evaluation method could naturally be used for ranking, but Table 1 only focuses on how ranking is used in the methodology section (but not in the automatic evaluation section). majority of the methods adopt LLMs rated score as reward value, which can be used for ranking (MCR [145], AIScientist, MOOSE-Chem, CycleResearcher). FunSearch focuses on code generation problem, therefore can directly precisely evaluate the generated code by running them and checking results. ChemReasoner [146] finetunes task-specific graph neural network model to obtain reward. HypoGeniC [193] and LLM-SR [140] focuses on data-driven discovery, which means they have access to observation examples that can be used to check the consistency with the generated hypotheses, where the number of consistent examples can be used as the reward value for ranking. Different from directly predicting reward score, IGA takes pairwise comparison, because they find that LLMs are poorly calibrated when asked directly to predict the final scores or decisions, but can achieve non-trivial accuracy when asked to judge which paper is better in pairwise comparisons. Inspired by IGA [141], CoI [77] proposes pairwise automatic evaluation system, named Idea Arena. Nova [49] also adopts pairwise automatic evaluation method. Automatic Research Question Construction. This key component is about automatic construction of research question, so that automated scientific discovery methods can use it as input to discover hypotheses. It indicates different role of LLM systems in scientific discovery: without it, an LLM serves as copilot, relying on researchers to propose good research questions; with it, the system operates in full-self-driving mode, capable of independent discovery without human input. The full-self-driving mode was first introduced by MOOSE and framed as an automated setting for scientific discovery. Specifically, they adopt an LLM-based agent to continually search through the discipline-related web corpus to find interesting research questions. AIScientist explores research directions by leveraging starting code implementation as input. MLR-Copilot finds research directions by analyzing the research gaps from input papers. SciAgents and Scideator skip research questions by directly generating hypotheses based on the pairing of concepts. VirSci generates research questions by leveraging LLM-based scientist agents to brainstorm. CoI finds research questions by collecting development line of methods and then predicting the next step. Nova directly generates seed ideas from input papers and common idea proposal patterns, skipping the research question construction step."

Some less-used evaluation criteria include relatedness, interestingness, and helpfulness. An alternative name for validity is feasibility. They might be used interchangeably in many scenarios. Validity refers to whether discovered scientific knowledge accurately reflects objective world, while feasibility concerns the practicability of an engineering finding. Helpfulness is subjective evaluation, based on the idea that the goal of discovery system is to act as copilot for researchers; therefore, its perceived usefulness by researchers could be considered important. In terms of the evaluator selection, the evaluation methods can be divided into LLM-based and expert-based evaluation. LLMs direct evaluation has shown high consistency score with expert evaluation in social science [174]. However, in natural science disciplines such as chemistry, LLMs have been argued to lack the capability to provide reliable evaluations [146]. Expert evaluation is generally considered reliable. However, in challenging fields like chemistry, even an experts direct evaluation may lack sufficient reliability [176]. This is due to (1) the complexity of the discipline; and (2) the fact that slight changes in the research topic can necessitate entirely different background Preprint. 12 Luo and Yang et al. knowledge for evaluation, while experts typically have specialized research focuses, which may not cover the full range of knowledge required for relatively reliable evaluation.

Due to reliability concerns with direct evaluation, reference-based evaluation serves as an alternative [68, 108, 176], which counts the key components from the ground truth hypotheses mentioned in the generated hypotheses. Moreover, in addition to directly assigning scalar evaluation score to generated hypothesis, Si et al. [141] propose comparison-based evaluations to alleviate the incapacity of LLM-based evaluation of direct scoring: the LLM evaluator is asked to keep comparing pairs of generated hypotheses until ranking is possible. It can be used when comparing the quality of hypotheses generated by two methods, but might not help in judging the absolute quality of hypothesis. However, the ultimate evaluation should be only through real (wet-lab) experiments. It raises challenges in the robotics and automatic experiment implementation fields."

As result, LLM-based discovery methods may have an upper performance limit, constrained by the capabilities of the state-of-the-art LLMs. However, it is largely (if not completely) unclear how should we augment LLMs ability on the task of scientific discovery. Thirdly, it is unclear on sufficient set of internal reasoning structure for scientific discovery: current works rely heavily on retrieving from high-quality knowledge source (e.g., literature) as inspiration to generate hypothesis. But it is unclear on whether there are any more internal reasoning structures that can help with the process. Finally, building accurate and well-structured benchmark highly relies on experts. However, the size of expert-composed benchmark is usually very limited. It is unclear on how should we scale up an accurate and well-structured discovery-oriented benchmark. Future work.

Numerous studies [14, 15, 52, 125, 136, 168] demonstrate how LLMs simplify intricate problems by defining experimental conditions and specifying desired outputs. For instance, HuggingGPT [136] utilizes LLMs to parse user queries into structured task lists while determining execution sequences and resource dependencies. Similarly, CRISPR-GPT [52] automates CRISPRbased gene-editing experiment design by facilitating the selection of appropriate CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and planning validation experiments. ChemCrow [15] employs iterative reasoning and dynamic planning, using structured \"Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation\" loop [177] to refine its approach based on real-time feedback. Multi-LLM systems, such as Coscientist [14] and LLM-RDF [131], further leverage specialized agents to extract methodologies from literature, translate natural language descriptions into standardized protocols, generate execution code for automated platforms, and adaptively correct errors during execution.

The challenges of employing LLMs for experiment planning and implementation arise both from their intrinsic limitations and their application to domain-specific tasks. One fundamental limitation is their planning capability. As clarified by Kambhampati et al. [64], LLMs in autonomous modes often fail to generate executable plans. They are prone to hallucinations, which can lead to irrational plans, deviations from task prompts, or an inability to follow complex instructions [55]. Prompt robustness poses another critical challenge in multi-stage experimental contexts. Minor variations in prompt wording, even when conveying the same intent, can result in inconsistent guidance throughout the planning and execution process [195], potentially affecting experimental outcomes. Additionally, the slow processing speed of autoregressive LLMs can impede real-time feedback in iterative and multi-step experiment planning, limiting their efficiency. Applicationspecific challenges include difficulties in adapting to specialized roles, as LLMs struggle to emulate domain-specific scientific expertise and cognitive processes essential for generalizability across research domains [167]. For example, certain experiments may require simulating ethically sensitive or error-prone scenarios, which often conflict with the safety-aligned values embedded in LLMs. Future work. Future research should address these challenges by enhancing core model capabilities and tailoring them to the unique requirements of experimental tasks. To mitigate hallucination risks, robust verification mechanisms can be integrated into workflows, such as cross-referencing outputs with external sound verifiers [64] or employing real-time feedback loops to correct inaccuracies dynamically [59]. Improving prompt robustness may involve developing adaptive systems that monitor and modify prompt structures in response to contextual changes, ensuring consistency across planning stages. Efficiency enhancements could be achieved by creating faster, distilled versions of LLMs optimized for multi-step reasoning or hybrid systems combining LLMs with smaller, task-specific models to balance speed and accuracy. For more effective role adaptation, fine-tuning LLMs with high-quality domain-specific datasets or developing modular frameworks could enable more precise emulation of specialized scientific reasoning. Additionally, designing adaptive alignment protocols may allow LLMs to safely simulate ethically complex scenarios when addressing specific experimental goals."

The challenges in citation text generation, related work generation, and drafting and writing primarily arise from inherent limitations in LLMs, such as maintaining factual accuracy, ensuring contextual coherence, and handling complex information. LLMs often struggle with hallucinations [59], generating incorrect or irrelevant citations, and are constrained by the retrieval systems they depend on [53]. Limited context windows further restrict models ability to manage extensive references or integrate relevant literature comprehensively [165], potentially leading to incorrect citation ordering and inappropriate citation grouping. Additionally, ensuring scientific rigor and avoiding reliance on superficial or trivial sources remain persistent obstacles, as LLMs struggle to capture the depth and reasoning needed in academic writing [103]. Furthermore, the use of LLMs in academic writing introduces significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding academic integrity and plagiarism [89]. This blurs the lines of authorship, as researchers might present machine-generated text as their own work. LLMs can also generate text that closely mimics existing literature, raising the risk of unintentional plagiarism where the generated content may not be sufficiently original. The convenience of using LLMs to draft sections of papers can undermine the rigorous intellectual effort traditionally required in academic writing, potentially devaluing the learning process and critical thinking skills essential to scholarly research. Future Work. To overcome these challenges, future advancements should focus on improving retrieval systems and enhancing models capacity to synthesize information from diverse, longcontext sources [87].

            "content": "The integration of LLMs in peer review has evolved into two distinct approaches, each addressing specific needs in the review process. The first approach, automated review generation, emerged from the need to handle increasing submission volumes and reduce reviewer workload by using 1https://blog.iclr.cc/2024/10/09/iclr2025-assisting-reviewers/ Preprint. 20 Luo and Yang et al. LLMs to analyze research papers independently [66, 182]. These systems are designed to evaluate multiple aspects of submissions, including methodology validation, results verification, and contribution assessment, thereby providing comprehensive review reports without direct human intervention. The second approach, LLM-assisted review workflows, developed in response to the recognition that human expertise remains crucial in academic evaluation while acknowledging that certain review tasks can benefit from automation[69]. These workflows incorporate LLMs as supplementary tools, where they assist human reviewers in time-consuming but well-defined tasks, such as paper summarization, reference verification, and internal consistency checks, while leaving critical evaluation and judgment to human experts. These approaches employ diverse methodologies to enhance review efficiency, consistency, and quality. To systematically evaluate and improve these systems, the research community has developed specialized peer review benchmarks that serve dual purposes: providing standardized training datasets and establishing performance assessment metrics. This chapter examines these methodologies, their evaluation frameworks, and concludes with implementation challenges and future research directions."

            "title": "5.2 Automated Peer Review Generation\nAutomated peer review generation aims to streamline scientific assessment by exploring how LLMs\ncan produce comprehensive reviews with minimal human intervention. By inputting a scientific\narticle, these systems focus on generating a complete peer review or meta-review, employing\nvarious techniques to enhance feedback’s depth, accuracy, and relevance.",
            "content": "Current approaches to automated peer review generation can be categorized into two main strategies: single-model and multi-model architectures. Single-model approaches focus on optimizing the review generation process through sophisticated prompting techniques and modular design. These systems typically employ carefully crafted prompts to guide the models attention to specific aspects of the paper, such as methodology, results, and contributions [132]. Within the single-model paradigm, several distinct architectural approaches have been proposed. CGI2 [184] advances beyond previous approaches: MetaGen [11], which used two-stage pipeline of extractive summarization with decision-aware refinement; Kumar et al. [67], which developed neural architecture for joint decision prediction and review generation; and MReD [135], which introduced structure-controlled generation using sentence-level functional labels. Building on these foundations, CGI2 implements staged review process through modular design, first extracting key opinions from the paper, then summarizing strengths and weaknesses, and finally refining these outputs through iterative feedback under checklist-guided framework. This iterative process enhances the depth and relevance of reviews but may struggle with papers that involve highly complex methodologies or lengthy content exceeding the context window. Taking different approach, CycleReviewer [167] implements an end-to-end review generation method using reinforcement learning to refine review quality through feedback loops continuously. While CycleReviewer excels in enhancing review precision and clarity, its reliance on significant computational resources could limit its scalability. Meanwhile, ReviewRobot [162] utilizes knowledge graphs to systematically identify and structure knowledge elements, transforming them into detailed review comments through structured generation process. ReviewRobot demonstrates remarkable explainability and evidence-based reasoning but is constrained by the inflexibility of its pre-defined templates. The alternative strategy employs multi-model architectures, representing more sophisticated approach by leveraging multiple specialized models to handle different aspects of the review process. This approach offers several advantages, including improved handling of complex papers and enhanced review quality through specialized expertise. Reviewer2 [39] implements two-stage process: one model generates specific aspect prompts, while another utilizes these prompts to create Preprint. LLM4SR: Survey on Large Language Models for Scientific Research detailed, focused feedback. This separation of prompt generation and review creation allows for more nuanced and targeted feedback but often results in partial or biased reviews due to the lack of an integrated framework. To address these limitations, SEA [180] employs separate models for standardization, evaluation, and analysis, providing more comprehensive and balanced approach. The system unifies multiple reviews into single format, significantly reducing redundancy and inconsistencies across feedback. Furthermore, SEA introduces mismatch score to measure the alignment between papers and generated reviews, coupled with self-correction strategy to enhance review quality iteratively. While these features enable SEA to surpass Reviewer2 in consistency and comprehensiveness, the need for coordinating outputs across multiple models introduces added complexity. Building on specialization but addressing different challenge, MARG [28] tackles the problem of processing papers that exceed typical LLM context limits. By introducing multiagent framework, MARG distributes review tasks across multiple specialized models, allowing for comprehensive review of longer papers while maintaining attention to detail throughout the document. This innovative approach ensures detailed, aspect-specific feedback. Still, it brings new challenges, such as coordinating the communication and outputs of various agents, which increases the difficulty of ensuring consistency and alignment. Each architectural approach offers distinct advantages and faces unique challenges. Singlemodel approaches benefit from simpler implementation and more straightforward control over the review process, but they may struggle with longer or more complex papers. Multi-model architectures provide greater scalability and better handling of sophisticated review tasks, yet they demand careful coordination and face potential consistency challenges across their components. For instance, ReviewRobots structured approach offers explainability and actionable insights. Still, it is less adaptable to evolving research domains, while CycleReviewers iterative refinement improves dynamic adaptability without requiring substantial training resources. As research in this area progresses, combining the strengths of single-model simplicity with the adaptability of multi-model designs presents promising avenue for enhancing review quality, consistency, and comprehensiveness."

Systems like AgentReview [60] demonstrate\nthis synergy in practice, where LLM generates initial insights that human reviewers then refine\nand validate.",
            "content": "The LLM-assisted peer review workflows enhance three primary functions in the scientific review process: (1) information extraction and summarization, which helps reviewers quickly grasp paper content; (2) manuscript validation and quality assurance, which supports systematic verification of paper claims; and (3) review writing support, which assists in generating well-structured feedback. In the information extraction and summarization function, systems automate document understanding and synthesis to support reviewer comprehension. PaperMage [101] is foundational toolkit that integrates natural language processing and computer vision models to process visually rich scientific documents, enabling sophisticated extraction of logical structure, figures, and textual content across multiple modalities. Complementing this structural analysis, CocoSciSum [29] focuses on content summarization, offering customizable paper summaries with precise control over length and keyword inclusion while maintaining high factual accuracy through its compositional control architecture. Preprint. 22 Luo and Yang et al. For the manuscript validation and quality assurance function, systems operate at different levels of analysis to ensure scientific rigor. At the local level, ReviewerGPT [97] specializes in systematic error detection and guideline compliance, achieving high accuracy in verifying submission requirements while effectively identifying mathematical errors and conceptual inconsistencies within individual manuscripts. While ReviewerGPT focuses on internal manuscript validation, PaperQA2 [144] performs global validation by examining claims against the broader scientific literature, employing sophisticated language agents to detect contradictions and verify assertions. The system demonstrates robust performance by identifying an average of 2.34 validated contradictions per paper while maintaining high factual accuracy in its cross-literature analyses. Additionally, Scideator [122], designed to facilitate idea validation, operates through facet recombination to identify novel and scientifically grounded analogies between papers. Scideator also includes novelty checker, which evaluates claims for uniqueness and adherence to established research paradigms, offering reviewers enhanced capabilities to scrutinize manuscripts rigorously. In the review writing support function, systems take different yet complementary approaches to assist reviewers at various expertise levels. ReviewFlow [149] provides intelligent scaffolding through contextual reflection cues and note synthesis guidance, modeling expert practices to help novice reviewers produce well-structured reviews. The systems step-by-step approach benefits those new to peer review by decomposing the complex task into manageable components. While ReviewFlow focuses on individual reviewer guidance, CARE [198] emphasizes collaborative aspects of review writing through an integrated platform featuring NLP-enhanced inline annotations and real-time collaboration features, enabling reviewers to work together more effectively while providing detailed and constructive feedback [19, 83]. Further complementing these functionalities, DocPilot [110] leverages modular task planning and code generation capabilities to automate repetitive and complex tasks in document workflows. Its structured approach to managing and annotating scientific PDFs ensures that reviewers can focus on substantive feedback rather than procedural hurdles, significantly improving their efficiency."

Preprint. LLM4SR: Survey on Large Language Models for Scientific Research 23 This need has led to the development of specialized benchmarks that assess various aspects of LLMbased peer review systems, from their ability to generate high-quality reviews to their effectiveness in supporting human reviewers. The development and evaluation of LLM-based peer review systems rely on standardized benchmarks that assess different aspects of the review process. These benchmarks can be broadly categorized into three main types: (1) comprehensive review datasets that support holistic evaluation, including editorial decisions, scoring, and pragmatic analysis; (2) specialized assessment datasets that focus on specific aspects like opinion synthesis and consistency analysis; and (3) quality evaluation datasets that measure review effectiveness through deficiency identification and acceptance prediction. Table 5 presents an overview of these key benchmarks and their associated evaluation frameworks. The datasets, primarily sourced from publicly accessible academic conferences, serve diverse purposes in peer review tasks. Comprehensive datasets like MOPRD [94] and NLPeer [33] provide broad coverage, supporting tasks ranging from editorial decision prediction to pragmatic labeling. More specialized datasets focus on specific aspects of the review process: ASAP-Review [183] and Reviewer2 [39] emphasize acceptance prediction and coverage assessment. Recent additions such as ReviewCritique [32] introduce novel mechanisms for comparative analysis between human and LLM-generated reviews. The evaluation framework for these benchmarks encompasses multiple dimensions, as detailed in Table 5. Semantic Similarity measures how closely generated reviews align with reference texts, typically using metrics like ROUGE and BertScore. Coherence and Relevance evaluate the logical flow and topical appropriateness of reviews, while Diversity and Specificity assess the range and depth of feedback provided. Human Evaluation, incorporating expert assessment of review quality, offers crucial validation of automated metrics. Together, these four evaluation components - Semantic Similarity, Coherence and Relevance, Diversity and Specificity, and Human Evaluation - form multi-faceted approach that ensures comprehensive assessment of LLM-generated reviews across various quality dimensions."

As academic institutions and publishers explore this technology, understanding\nits limitations and potential becomes crucial for the scholarly community.",
            "content": "Challenges. At the heart of peer review lies the need for deep expertise, nuanced understanding, and careful judgment. While LLMs show promise in supporting this process, their limitations reveal the complexity of automating scholarly assessment. fundamental challenge is that LLMs often struggle to fully grasp the specialized terminology and complex concepts within academic fields. For example, in biochemistry, an LLM might misinterpret the significance of specific protein interactions, while in theoretical physics, it could fail to recognize subtle but critical assumptions in mathematical models [192]. This limited technical comprehension directly impacts the LLMs ability to evaluate research methodology. When an LLM cannot fully understand field-specific concepts, it cannot reliably assess whether the research methods are appropriate or if the evidence justifies the conclusions. For instance, where methodological standards vary across fields in interdisciplinary research, LLMs often fail to identify critical issues such as inadequate sample sizes, inappropriate statistical tests, or missing experimental controls [129]. This limitation becomes particularly concerning given the high stakes of peer review in ensuring research quality and scientific integrity. Preprint. 24 Luo and Yang et al. The complexity of academic writing introduces additional challenges, mainly when dealing with longer manuscripts. Even as context windows expand, LLMs struggle to maintain coherent analysis across extensive texts, often losing track of complex arguments spanning multiple sections. This limitation frequently results in inconsistent or contradictory evaluations [18]. More concerning is the persistent issue of hallucinationmodels sometimes generate convincing but incorrect assessments, particularly when reviewing novel research approaches [28]. Furthermore, implementing LLMs in peer review faces additional challenges beyond technical performance limitations. fundamental infrastructure issue is the shortage of specialized training data [65, 184], which creates an uneven landscape across academic disciplines. This data scarcity particularly affects fields with smaller research communities or specialized vocabularies. Equally concerning are the ethical implications of LLM-assisted peer review. Issues of algorithmic bias and transparency [133] have emerged alongside new forms of academic misconduct, such as plagiarism laundering [117]. Additionally, critical concern is the potential homogenization of academic feedback if many researchers rely on the same LLM systems for peer review [91]. The widespread use of similar AI tools may reduce the diversity of perspectives and diminish the creative insights that stem from the distinct thought processes of individual human reviewers. Future Work. To advance LLMs capabilities in academic paper reviewing, several fundamental technical challenges must be prioritized. First, current LLMs struggle with specialized technical concepts across different academic fields, necessitating improved approaches for processing and understanding domain-specific terminology. Second, we need enhanced citation analysis capabilities to verify reference relevance and assess how effectively citations support papers arguments. Third, analyzing long academic documents requires new methods for maintaining coherence - from cross-referencing between sections to verifying consistency across methods, results, and conclusions. Beyond technical improvements, developing effective human-AI collaboration frameworks is crucial. The next generation of review systems must create intuitive interfaces that highlight potential issues and integrate seamlessly with human workflow [31]. These collaborative systems must be adaptable across different academic fields, with special consideration for disciplines with limited computational resources [132]. Rigorous evaluation frameworks for these human-AI systems must ensure they genuinely enhance reviewer efficiency and effectiveness [81, 169]. As LLM becomes more prevalent in peer review, robust governance mechanisms become critical. This includes developing reliable methods for detecting LLM-generated content, ensuring transparent tracking of LLM contributions, and maintaining reviewer authenticity [91]. Additionally, we need standardized protocols for securely integrating LLM review tools with existing journal platforms [6]. Lastly, progress in these areas must be measured through comprehensive evaluation frameworks. For technical capabilities, we need systematic assessments of improvements in language understanding, citation analysis, and document coherence. Human-AI collaboration metrics should evaluate the quality of LLM suggestions and their impact on reviewer efficiency. Governance evaluations must assess the reliability of LLM detection systems and the security of platform integrations. Crucially, these frameworks should examine potential biases across different academic disciplines, publication formats, and linguistic backgrounds to ensure equitable support for all scholarly communities. Through these targeted assessments, we can guide the development of LLM systems that meaningfully enhance the peer review process while maintaining its integrity. Preprint.
