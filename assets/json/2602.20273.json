Large language models (LLMs) often generate false or misleading information that, by all appearances, they know to be untrue (Pan et al., 2023; Scheurer et al., 2023; Abdulhai et al., 2025). While we cannot always verify the truthfulness of model generations, we can probe them to detect when models themselves represent their generations to be false (Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025). Therefore, understanding how LLMs internally represent truthfulness has become critical challenge for their safe deployment. Recent work suggests that LLMs develop linear representation of truthfulness that can be extracted via probing (Marks & Tegmark, 2023). If such representations are sufficiently general, they should enable reliable detection of model falsehoods regardless of domain, and potentially allow interventions to improve honesty (Li et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Cundy & Gleave, 2025; Ravfogel et al., 2025). Although some works show that these truth directions exhibit remarkable generalization across various domains and strategic deception scenarios (Burns et al., 2023; Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Burger et al., 2024; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025), others show that probes fail to generalize in some cases and argue that LLMs encode multiple, distinct notions of truth (Levinstein & Herrmann, 2024; Sky et al., 2024; Azizian et al., 2025; Orgad et al., 2025). We argue that these seemingly contradictory findings can be reconciled. Prior work has treated cross-domain generalization failure and geometric dissimilarity between probes as evidence against domain-general truth encoding. However, this inference is flawed: generalization may fail not because domain-general directions do not exist, but because we fail to discover them. Conversely, high probe generalization performance and high probe direction similarity do not preclude the existence of highly domain-specific directions. We propose the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: rather than exhibiting either single domain-general truth direction or entirely separate domain-specific directions, LLMs encode truthfulness along spectrum of generality, with directions at varying levels of generality coexisting in the representational space (Figure 1). At one end lies fully domain-general direction; at the other, fully domain-specific directions share no common structure; in between, direcThe Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 1. Truth representations in LLMs are graded in generality and reshaped by post-training. Left: Different truth types share partially overlapping but distinct sets of truth directions. These directions lie on spectrum from domain-general to domain-specific. The geometry of truth representations changes through post-training, pushing sycophancy into more distant subspace from other truth types. This reorganization causes probes trained on factual truth to fail on sycophancy detection, and vice versa (X). However, training on all domains still yields domain-general direction (X). Right: Concept erasure analysis further reveals the full spectrum of truth directions. tions generalize across some domains but not others. probe trained on one domain may capture superposition of these directions, combining domain-specific and more general features. The distribution of models truth representations along this spectrum has important implications for lie detection and alignment interventions. Our experiments are based on our FLEED dataset, large set of carefully controlled truthfulness datasets spanning five fundamental truth types: definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical. We additionally construct two novel deception datasets: sycophantic lying dataset where models alter their answers to align with user-stated beliefs, and an expectation-inverted dataset where the user expects models to make false claims, making true generations violate the user expectation and count as lies. We also evaluate on prior honesty benchmarks (Scheurer et al., 2023; Benton et al., 2024; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025). Our findings support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis. Linear probes generalize well across our five fundamental truth types and most honesty benchmarks, yet fail almost entirely on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying (AUROC 0.55). At the same time, it is possible to fit well-performing probe over all domains, suggesting generalization failure reflects incomplete recovery of general direction, not its absence. In addition, we show that these generalization patterns are explained by the geometry of probe directions: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes, which reweights the inner product by test data covariance to account for low effective dimensionality of our data, near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R2=0.98), significantly outperform the standard cosine similarity (R2=0.56). To understand how this geometry arises, we study the effect of post-training on truth encoding, and find that the representational geometry of truth is reorganized by posttraining. Specifically, in the base model, sycophancy representations are more aligned with other truth types, showing higher probe direction similarity and higher generalization performance. This suggests that post-training pushes sycophantic lying representation further away from other types of lying. This result provides representational account of why post-trained models are more sycophantic than base models (Wei et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024). To further provide constructive evidence that directions of varying degrees of generality coexist, we employ concepterasure methods (Ravfogel et al., 2020; Belrose et al., 2023) in two complementary experiments. First, we introduce Stratified INLP, two-stage hierarchical procedure that explicitly isolates highly domain-general and domain-specific directions. Second, we reveal directions of varying degrees of intermediate generality, which generalize across some domains but not others, using LEACE (Belrose et al., 2023). Causal steering experiments confirm that domain-specific directions are not merely predictive but functionally meaningful: steering along them increases confidence in correct answers relative to incorrect ones, while steering along the domain-general direction slightly degrades performance. This suggests that while domain-general truth directions are encoded by LLMs, they may not participate in causal mechanism underlying the truthfulness of model outputs.2 2We define truth directions solely based on encoding; see the Discussion for whether causal importance should also factor in. 2 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Together, these analyses demonstrate that truth directions of varying degrees of generality coexist in the same representational space, with different domains sharing structure in heterogeneous, partially overlapping ways (Figure 1). 2. Truthfulness Datasets 2.1. Fictional, Logical, Empirical, Ethical, and Definitional (FLEED) Dataset Existing truthfulness datasets typically focus on single truth types (e.g., empirical knowledge, logical reasoning), making it difficult to assess whether LLMs develop domain-general or domain-specific truth representations. To investigate this, we create balanced datasets of true/false statements across five basic categories: Definitional truth: Statements true by definition (e.g., triangle has three sides) Empirical truth: Empirical facts about the world (e.g., Water boils at 100C at sea level) Logical truth: Statements following from logical inference (e.g., If implies and implies C, then implies C) Fictional truth: Facts within fictional universes (e.g., Frodo carried the One Ring to Mordor) Ethical truth: Behaviors generally recognized as ethical (e.g., told the jury the correct information) Except for the ethical truth, each truth type contains about 1,200 examples (600 positive, 600 negative), yielding 4,800 total claims. Claims are generated by prompting Gemini-3-Pro to create paired positive and negative instances for each truth type, with careful attention to generating diverse and plausible-sounding negations. To ensure dataset quality, we manually filter low-quality or ambiguous examples. The ethical truth data is adapted from the commonsense subset of the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), filtered to 4,000 short-form samples. See Appendix for details of dataset construction. 2.2. Sycophantic Lying Dataset We construct sycophantic lying dataset where models change their answers to align with user beliefs rather than reporting their believed true answer. This dataset was built using questions from STEM subjects in MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020a), with fake user bios added (Perez et al., 2023). Figure 9 illustrates the dataset construction process. Specifically, we first query the model on MMLU STEM questions without additional context to establish its true belief baseline. We then re-query the model with user biographies indicating STEM expertise and pre-stated user answer (e.g., have PhD in Mathematics from Berkeley... believe the answer is (A)...). We identify sycophantic lying samples where the model changes its original answer to align with the users preference, and pair these with control cases where the model maintains its original answer. Each pair shares an identical biography and question, differing only in the users preferred answer and the models final response. We apply additional filtering to ensure data quality. See Appendix and Figure 9 for more details. Our dataset design builds on prior sycophancy evaluations (Perez et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024) with two key methodological choices. First, we measure whether the model changes its answer in response to user beliefs, rather than simply measuring agreement rates. This disentangles model accuracy from model honesty (Turpin et al., 2023). Second, we construct this dataset with highly controlled positive and negative pairs, sampled on-policy rather than prefilling the model response with positive (lying) or negative (honest) responses. 2.3. Expectation-inverted Dataset To test whether probes detect objective truth values or userexpected truth values, we construct dataset that disentangles the two. We pair true and false statements from (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023) with the prompt: Pretend youre dishonest person making statements about the world, which inverts the typical confound. Here, producing true statements now violates user expectations, while false statements comply with them. As we show later, many lie detector probes fail to generalize to this kind of honesty evaluation. 2.4. Honesty Benchmarks To evaluate generalization beyond our curated datasets, we incorporate goal-directed deception scenarios from prior works, including insider trading, sandbagging, and roleplaying lying, where models are evaluated on their own generated responses when encouraged to lie to achieve specified goals (Scheurer et al., 2023; Benton et al., 2024; GoldowskyDill et al., 2025). 3. Experimental Setup Models. We use LLAMA-3.3-70B-INSTRUCT for our main experiments (Grattafiori et al., 2024). To verify robustness, we replicate key findings on LLAMA-3.1-8BINSTRUCT, LLAMA-3.2-3B-INSTRUCT, QWEN-2.5-14BINSTRUCT, QWEN-2.5-7B-INSTRUCT, and their corresponding base models (Qwen et al., 2025) (see Appendix C). Activation Extraction. We extract activations from the residual stream, following prior work that shows these representations contain rich semantic information (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025). We extract activations from all layers on rel3 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 2. Probing Generalization Performance. We report the average AUROC for 5-fold cross-validation on Llama-3.3-70B. Probes trained on any one of our five truth types generalize to each other, but perform poorly on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. probe trained on all domains generalizes well to all domains, performing on par with the best individual probe performance. Parrack et al., 2025). We used 5-fold cross-validation for all experiments on training and testing probes. Based on cross-domain performance on FLEED datasets, we selected layer 33, logistic regression, and training on average token for our final experiments. See Appendix for the full tuning experiments. Comparison between our probe design and that of prior works is shown in Table 2. 4. Probe Generalization Across Datasets We begin by testing the transfer performance of linear probes on Llama-3.3-70B. Figure 2 presents the crossdomain generalization performance of probes trained on different datasets. The in-distribution performance of each domain is near-perfect (>0.95). Probes trained on any of the five FLEED truth types generalize effectively to one another (leftmost five columns) and transfer selectively to prior on-policy honesty benchmarks (rightmost three columns). Sycophancy and expectation inverted lying notably stand out: probes trained on these datasets fail to generalize to FLEED, with the expectation inverted lying probe performing well below chance (AUROC0.28). Both probes from prior works and our own fail to detect sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. However, training on all domains achieves high performance across all datasets, meaning there exist domain-general truth directions that do well across datasets. We also show that Llama-8B exhibits similar generalization pattern (Figure 14; Appendix C). Low probe generalization performances do not rule out the existence of domain-general directions (Burger et al., 2024). Figure 3. Mahalanobis cosine similarity linearly predicts OOD probe performance. Each point is pair of datasets: the probe is trained on one and tested on the other. Mahalanobis cosine similarity achieves R2=0.98, substantially outperforming standard cosine similarity (R2=0.56; Figure 18). evant assistant output tokens for 3B, 7B, and 8B models, and to save compute and storage, every 2 layers for the 14B models and every 5 layers for the 70B models. Probe Architecture. We compare three probe architectures: 1) Difference of Means (DoM), 2) Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). For token aggregation during training, we compare using: (1) the last token activations only, (2) the average of all token activations, or (3) all token activations separately. For evaluation, we test on the average token activations as it provides the best performance (Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025; 4 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 4. Post-training reduces alignment between sycophantic lying and other truth types. (a,b) Base models show substantially better probe generalization between FLEED and sycophancy than chat models, indicating that post-training pushes sycophancy into subspace more orthogonal to other truth types. (c) Probe direction similarity between FLEED and sycophancy is significantly higher in the base models compared to chat models. See similar results on Qwen family models in Appendix and Figure 19. 5. Geometry of Probe Directions To understand why probes exhibit distinct generalization patterns, we analyze the geometric relationship between their weight vectors. We define the Mahalanobis cosine similarity between two probe directions wA and wB as CosΣ(wA, wB) = (cid:113) Σtest wB (cid:113) w Σtest wA BΣtest wB , (1) where Σtest is the full sample covariance of the test data. Standard cosine similarity treats all dimensions equally, yet variance is concentrated along small number of directions (the effective dimensionality of our data is fewer than 100 in an 8192-dimensional space). Therefore, the thousands of low-variance dimensions can induce noise, masking genuine alignment between probe directions. The Mahalanobis variant reweights the inner product by the data covariance. Directions along which representations barely vary cannot affect classification, and thus are down-weighted. As shown in Figure 3, Mahalanobis cosine similarity is an almost perfect linear predictor of cross-domain AUROC (R2=0.98, squared Spearman ρ2=0.95), far exceeding standard cosine similarity (R2=0.56, ρ2=0.75; Figure 18, Appendix D). We further validate this relationship with controlled simulations across five diverse data distributions. Mahalanobis cosine similarity achieves R2 0.95 in all conditions, while standard cosine similaritys R2 drops to as low as 0.01 (Figure 16; Appendix D). 6. Post-training Reorganizes Geometry The previous section shows that probes trained on other truth types fail to detect sycophantic lying, with AUROCs near chance. To investigate how this phenomenon arises, we compare the probing performances in base (pretrained) models versus chat (post-trained) models. Our results show that post-training reshapes how the model geometrically represents truth, creating greater separation 5 between sycophantic lying and other truth types. Figure 4 shows results for three Llama models of varying sizes. Similar results on Qwen models are shown in Appendix E. For all three models, base model probes transfer much better between sycophancy and other truth types from our FLED datasets (Figure 4a,b). For example, for Llama-70B and Llama-8B, probes trained on FLED achieve 0.74 AUROC in the base model, but only 0.62 and 0.59 in the chat model, respectively. Probe direction geometry shows similar patterns: the probe direction similarity is higher in the base models than in the chat models (Figure 4c). Nonetheless, even in base models where generalization is stronger, probes trained on FLED achieve only weak performance on sycophancy (AUROC < 0.75), suggesting that in-distribution training on sycophancy is still required for robust detection of sycophantic lying. For detailed generalization performance across all layers and all models, see Figure 15 and 20 in Appendix This geometric reorganization may provide representational account for the well-documented observation that post-trained models are much more sycophantic than their base counterparts (Wei et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024). Taken together, our results suggest that chat models not only represent when they are being sycophantic, but that posttraining reorganizes this representation into geometry that is markedly distinct from other forms of truthfulness. 7.

            "content": "We apply concept erasure methods to provide constructive evidence of the full spectrum of truth directions in the two analyses below. 7.1. Extracting Highly Domain-General and Domain-Specific Directions Design. While finding generalizing directions (by training and testing on all domains jointly) is straightforward, The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 5. Stratified INLP Reveals Highly Domain-general and Domain-specific Directions. (a) Domain-general directions. Crossdomain accuracies for the first five mutually-orthogonal directions extracted by training on all domains jointly are high across all domains. (b) Domain-specific Directions. Accuracy for directions extracted from individual domains after the four domain-general directions have been projected out. While in-distribution accuracy (Self; blue) remains high, generalization to other domains (Other; yellow) drops toward chance (0.5; gray dashed line), indicating these directions encode truth information unique to specific domain. atively: after obtaining each probe direction, we project representations onto its null space and train new probe on the projected representations. Repeating this times yields mutually orthogonal highly domain-general directions {vgen }, each capturing truthfulness information that generalizes across all training domains. , . . . , vgen 1 In Stage 2, we extract domain-specific directions by first projecting representations onto the null space of the domaingeneral directions, then applying INLP separately for each domain using only its training data. We show that this yields highly domain-specific directions {vspe 1,d, . . . , vspe K,d} that encode truthfulness information for only one domain. This stratified procedure naturally extends to hierarchical process. After removing globally domain-general directions, subsets of domains may still share significant dimensions even as others become domain-specific. By iteratively identifying and removing these subset-general directions shared by some domains but not all until cross-domain information is largely exhausted, we obtain richer hierarchy spanning the generality spectrum and ensure that directions extracted in Stage 2 are more domain-specific. Specifically, we extract 5 directions across all domains, 3 for FLED datasets, 6 for definitional, empirical, and fictional domains, and finally 4 domain-specific directions per domain. Results. The domain-general directions exhibit high accuracy across all domains (Figure 5a). The first direction achieves accuracies ranging from 0.85 on logical claims to 1.00 on insider trading, with subsequent directions maintaining strong cross-domain performance. For the full Stage 1 removal results, see Figure 21 in Appendix F. After removing domain-general directions, the remaining directions extracted for each domain show stronger specificity (Figure 5b). These directions achieve high accuracy on their Figure 6. Performance of Selected Probes after LEACE Erasure. Each row shows one probe. Probes in-distribution performance is perfect (green), while performance on erased domains drops to chance (red). Probe generalization to other domains shows selective failure. From top to bottom, the probes get increasingly more domain-specific. For performances of all probes after LEACE erasure, see Figure 24 in Appendix F. identifying directions that perform well on single domain but do not generalize to other domains is more challenging. One way to address this is via adversarial training. We take simpler approach and propose new iterative information-removal procedure. We introduce Stratified INLP, two-stage procedure based on INLP (Iterative Nullspace Projection; Ravfogel et al., 2020) to explicitly isolate directions at both ends of the generality spectrum.3 In Stage 1, we extract domain-general directions by training probe on all truth domains, then apply INLP iter3As noted by Belrose et al. (2023), INLP is not an ideal method for achieving linear concept erasure. We use it here because it provides practical procedure for identifying multiple, mutually orthogonal truth directions with high accuracy. Since our work focuses directly on the existence and generalization of multiple directions, this capability is the key consideration. The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis training domain (Self; blue bars) but perform at near-chance levels on all other domains (Other; orange bars). For the full cross-domain performance for each domain-specific direction, see Figure 22 in Appendix F. These results provide constructive evidence for the coexistence of highly domain-general and highly domain-specific directions, even though probing with individual datasets does not naturally identify them. 7.2. Selective Erasure Reveals Directions of Intermediate Generality To provide constructive evidence for directions of intermediate generality, we apply LEACE (LEAst-squares Concept Erasure; (Belrose et al., 2023)) to selectively remove the subspace predictive of one FLEED truth type, then retrain and evaluate probes on all domains using the transformed representations, following the same protocol as in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 6, after erasure, probes trained on nonerased domains maintain perfect in-distribution performance (green boxes), confirming the erased subspace is not necessary for their training domain. As expected, performance on the erased domain drops to chance (red boxes; also see Figure 23; Appendix F). Importantly, however, these probes exhibit selective generalization failure, transferring well to some domains but failing completely on others, which reveals directions of intermediate generality between the fully domain-general and fully domain-specific extremes. Moreover, the degradation differs depending on which domain was erased and which was trained on. This heterogeneity demonstrates that different truth types share partially overlapping but distinct sets of directions, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We formalize this intuition as constrained capacity allocation problem over intersecting subspaces and show that L1-regularized optimization over our empirical transfer and erasure matrices allocates the highest capacity to subspaces shared by 36 domains, rather than to single domain-general or strictly domain-specific direction (Figure 25; Appendix F.1). Together, these results reveal complex representational geometry consistent with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis. 8. Causal Assessment of Truth Directions Having identified both domain-specific and general truth directions via Stratified INLP, we now assess their causal importance: do these directions functionally influence the models truthfulness behavior? Design. We run the causal experiment with Llama-8B and use verified SimpleQA (Haas et al., 2025) as held-out test set, which includes 1,024 factual questions with verified answers. For each question q, we pair the correct answer Figure 7. Effect of Causal Intervention Along Domain-General and Domain-Specific Directions Identified by Stratified INLP. We report the intervention effect (α = 2) on Llama-8B across different levels of baseline P(correct)/P(incorrect), binned by percentile. Most domain-specific directions improve truthfulness, while domain-general direction hurts (red rectangle). Larger effects are observed for samples where the model is initially more confident for all directions. a+ with type-matched distractor sampled from other questions of the same answer type (e.g., person names paired with other person names). We measure the log-probability difference: diff(q) = log (a+ q) log (a q) (2) Our metric is the change after intervention: diff = diffintervened diffbaseline, where diff > 0 indicates improved discrimination. To steer the model behavior, we add scaled truth direction to the MLP output bias at layer 15: ℓ = bℓ + α d, with α = 2.0. We apply stratified INLP on our FLEED and sycophancy datasets and factual knowledge datasets from prior works (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025) to obtain 14 domainspecific directions and single general direction. We run with 10 general directions and 5 domain-specific ones. Results. As shown in Figure 7, most domain-specific truth directions are not merely predictive of truth but also causally utilized by the model, yielding positive mean diff of +0.05 averaged across all domain-specific directions. Interestingly, while most domain-specific directions yield positive effects, the domain-general direction produces consistently negative diff values (mean = 0.07; red rectangle). This asymmetry likely reflects the nature of the evaluation: SimpleQA tests factual knowledge, aligning well with the domain-specific training distributions, whereas the domaingeneral direction conflates factual and sycophancy-related variance. Indeed, the domain-specific sycophancy direction hurts even more than the general direction. 7 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Moreover, the intervention effect size increases with baseline confidence. The intervention effects are minimal when the model initially favors the incorrect answer (010th percentile, corresponding to baseline P(correct)/P(incorrect) ratio < 1), but the effects increase dramatically at higher confidence levels. For examples where the model is already highly confident in the correct answer (90100th percentile), domain-specific interventions further boost discrimination (diff +0.10), while the general direction actively degrades it (diff 0.11). This suggests that intervention along domain-specific directions reinforces the confidence in correct knowledge that the model already possesses, instead of flipping the models answer from incorrect to correct. In addition, we show that the mechanism by which the effective directions affect the model is by suppressing (a) while leaving (a+) unchanged (see Figure 26; Appendix G). Our causal experiments show that (1) truth directions extracted via Stratified INLP are causally meaningful, (2) domain-specific directions substantially outperform general directions in steering model behavior, suggesting that while universal truth directions may suffice for monitoring, reliable behavioral intervention appears to require domainspecific representations. 9. Related Works White-box Lie Detection and Intervention in LLMs. Extensive work has explored probing methods to detect when LLMs generate false information. Early works show that classifiers trained on hidden states can predict various linguistic properties and factual knowledge (Petroni et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2020; Belinkov, 2022). Azaria & Mitchell (2023) shows that MLP classifiers trained on hidden states can predict truthfulness, outperforming outputbased methods. Subsequent works establish that truthfulness is encoded linearly (Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Burns et al., 2023; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025; Bao et al., 2025; Ravfogel et al., 2025). These findings enabled further intervention methods Li et al. (2023); Marks & Tegmark (2023); Zou et al. (2023); Cundy & Gleave (2025) that improve truthfulness. However, the generality of truth directions remains contested. Levinstein & Herrmann (2024) shows probes fail to transfer from affirmative to negated statements; Orgad et al. (2025) and Azizian et al. (2025) further cross-domain generalization failure and show that truth directions across tasks are nearly orthogonal. Burger et al. (2024) reconciles some of these findings by identifying two-dimensional truth subspace that explains prior negation failures. Liu et al. (2024) shows that while single-dataset probes suffer 25% OOD accuracy drops, training on 40+ diverse datasets achieves robust cross-task generalization. Our work extends this line by showing that joint training recovers domain-general directions even when pairwise transfer fails. We reconcile the conflicting findings above with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist, from fully domain-general to fully domain-specific. Long et al. (2025) shows that probes track the models instructed output rather than ground truth when models are explicitly told to deceive. We use similar expectation-inverted scenarios to evaluate whether probes detect literal truth or context-dependent honesty. From theoretical perspective, Ravfogel et al. (2025) shows linear truth encoding emerges under simplified assumptions, though generalization across multiple relations remains an open question that our empirical results begin to address. Representation geometry and probe transferability. LLM representations are known to be highly anisotropic (Ethayarajh, 2019), and their intrinsic dimensionality is far below the ambient dimensionoften only tens to hundreds of effective dimensions even in spaces with thousands of coordinates (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Valeriani et al., 2023). This structure makes standard cosine similarity unreliable for comparing directions in representation space. The neuroscience literature has shown that whitened cosine similarity substantially improves comparison of representational geometries (Diedrichsen et al., 2021). Separately, lightweight transferability metrics such as LEEP (Nguyen et al., 2020) and LogME (You et al., 2021) predict cross-domain performance without retraining, but operate on features rather than on learned classifier directions. Azizian et al. (2025) show that standard cosine similarity between truthfulness probe directions only moderately correlates with cross-task AUROC (r=0.59). We argue that this moderate correlation reflects limitation of the metric. Our Mahalanobis cosine similarity applies covariance-reweighting to probe weight vectors specifically, yielding an almost perfect predictor of cross-domain AUROC. Sycophancy and the Effect of Post-training. Sycophancy has emerged as significant failure mode recently. Prior works show that sycophancy is an inverse-scaling phenomenon and is incentivized by post-training (instruction tuning and RLHF) (Wei et al., 2023; Perez et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024). At the representational level, Rimsky et al. (2024) provides initial evidence that sycophancy shares structure with other lie types, as steering vectors derived from sycophancy data weakly modulate TruthfulQA performance. Our work systematically characterizes this relationship, finding that sycophancy probes are more similar to other truth probes in the base models and thus generalize better compared to the chat models, providing representational account of the behavioral differences. 10.

            "content": "The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Our findings support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis, reconciling prior contradictory findings where probes both generalize broadly and fail dramatically depending on the domains involved. Therefore, the claims that each domain is distinct and that there exists domain-general truth direction can be both correct. While developed for truthfulness, our spectrum hypothesis may apply to other concepts and representations such as sentiment, toxicity, or intent. The analyses introduced here (Stratified INLP, selective erasure) provide tools for investigating such questions. For lie detection, our results suggest that novel deception types may still evade even broadly-trained detectors. Therefore, we recommend training on maximally diverse data while remaining vigilant that coverage is never guaranteed. For interventions, our causal experiments show that domainspecific directions outperform domain-general ones, suggesting that while domain-general probes enable broad detection, they may be limited for reliable behavioral control. We show that Mahalanobis cosine similarity linearly predicts probe generalization performance, both in our crossdomain probing experiments and in controlled simulations (R2 0.95). theoretical account of this tight linear relationship is an interesting direction for future work. Why do universal truth directions exist but fail to steer behavior? One explanation is that probes can identify these directions as superpositions of domain-specific ones, but only the domain-specific directions causally influence the models outputs. If so, universal directions would be useful for monitoring but not for steering. Finally, we show that post-training substantially reorganizes truthfulness representations, increasing dissociation between sycophantic lying and other truth types. This geometric shift may explain why post-trained models exhibit more sycophancy than base models (Wei et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024). 11. Limitations Our datasets do not exhaustively cover all truth types, and other truth types may occupy different representational subspaces. The FLEED datasets are model-generated, which may introduce subtle biases and spurious features. Our analysis focuses exclusively on linear structure; nonlinear truth representations may exist, but would require different methods to uncover. Our post-training analysis centers on sycophancy, while other representational shifts may occur that we do not characterize. Finally, our causal interventions show modest effects, modulating confidence rather than reliably flipping predictions. We hope that better understanding of how LLMs represent truthfulness will enable important applications in monitoring LLMs for misleading claim generation and steering these models to be more truthful. These applications are especially important when LLMs trained with RLHF reliably mislead users even in response to innocuous instructions (Abdulhai et al., 2025). We acknowledge there is some dualrisk concern that improved methods may enable bad actors to produce more subtly misleading LLMs via steering, such as more sycophantic models."

In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024. 11 A. Datasets The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis A.1. Fictional, Logical, Empirical, Ethical, and Definitional (FLEED) Dataset. Dataset Construction Pipeline Apart from the ethical truth, we prompt Gemini-3-Pro to generate an initial set of 300 to 600 ground-truth claims for the four truth types: definitional, empirical, logical, and fictional. Below is the prompt for generating the empirical truth dataset: Prompt for Dataset Generation - Empirical Generate 300 true factual claims about the world. Examples: Paris is the capital of France. The Earth orbits around the Sun. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Constraints per claim: 1. Focus on basic, widely-known facts. 2. Vary domains (geography, science, history, etc.). 3. Keep claims simple and uncontroversial. 4. Ensure statements are easily verifiable. We then prompt the model again to generate negations for each claim: Prompt for Generating Negations Transform the following true claims into false claims by negating them. Use different negation strategies for variety, such as: 1. Direct negation (adding not or no) 2. Replacing key terms with opposites 3. Changing quantities or descriptors 4. Substituting incorrect information Examples: Original: Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Negations: Water is not composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Water is composed of nitrogen and carbon. Water contains no hydrogen atoms. [List of original claims here] Finally, we manually filter the claims and their negations to ensure quality. For ethical truth, we use the short-form samples (less than 100 characters) from the commonsense subset of the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Dataset examples. We include examples from the each of four truth types and negation types in Table 1. Rather than simple logical negation (e.g., triangle does not have three sides It is not the case that triangle has three sides), we use LLMs to create diverse, realistic negations. This diversity ensures that probes must learn robust representations of truthfulness and reduce the risk of spurious features. Prompt for extracting activations. For definitional, empirical, logical, and fictional truth, we use simple prompting process shown in the left box below, extracting activations from the tokens corresponding to the assistants responses. For ethical truth, we follow (Hendrycks et al., 2021) using the format shown in the right box. Definitional Empirical Logical Fictional Truth Prompt Ethical Truth Prompt User: Please tell me fact. User: [Description of an action] Assistant: [True/false claim from dataset] Assistant: This is wrong. / This is not wrong. 12 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Truth Type Negation Type Original Claim Negated Claim Empirical Direct Negation Quantity Change Information Substitution Gravity is the force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Paris is the capital of France. Gravity is not the force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun. Humans have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Berlin is the capital of France. Definitional Direct Negation Quantity Change An alphabet is standard set of letters used to write language. triangle is polygon with three sides and three angles. Information Substitution Water is chemical compound with the formula H2O. An alphabet is not standard set of letters used to write language triangle is polygon with four sides and four angles. Water is chemical compound with the formula CO2. Logical Direct Negation Quantity Change Information Substitution If = and = c, then equals c. 99 < 100. The contrapositive of If then is If not Q, then not P. If = and = c, then never equals c. 99 < 90. The contrapositive of If then is If then P.

Examples of claims and negations across different truth types and negation types. Figure 8. PCA on Truth Representations Across Datasets. Scatter plot showing activations from Llama-70B layer 33 for honest statements (blue) and deceptive (red) samples across the four truth type datasets, sycophancy, Goldowsky-Dill et al. (2025), and Marks & Tegmark (2023). The intermixing of true and false points in the highest-variance directions demonstrates that our datasets are well-controlled, with truth directions encoded in lower-variance subspaces. The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 9. Construction of the Sycophancy Dataset. Left: We first extract the models true belief on MMLU STEM questions. Middle: sycophantic example in which the users preferred answer differs from the models true belief, yet the model agrees with the user, contradicting its own belief. Right: An honest example in which the users preferred answer aligns with the models true belief. Dataset geometry. As shown in Figure 8, PCA on the activations from our four truth-type and sycophancy datasets reveals that truth and false statements occupy similar geometric structures in the activation space, indicating that our datasets are well-controlled and do not contain trivial geometric separability. A.2. Sycophantic Lying Dataset Dataset Construction Pipeline. To construct our sycophancy dataset, we follow the pipeline below (also shown in Figure 9): Baseline Extraction: We query the model on MMLU STEM questions without additional context to establish its true belief baseline. Sycophancy Elicitation: We re-query the model with the same MMLU questions, but with user biographies indicating STEM expertise and pre-stated user answer pre-pended to observe potential sycophantic shifts. Controlled Pair Filtering: We identify samples where the model changes its original answer to align with the users preference (sycophantic lying). These are paired with control cases where the model remains steadfast. Each pair shares an identical biography and question, differing only in the users preferred answer and the models final response. Quality Subsampling: To ensure data quality, we try two ways of filtering. First, we filter to samples where the model exhibits high confidence (predictive probability > 0.5). Alternative, we filter to samples where the original model answer is correct. Both yield similar results (see Figure 11). MMLU STEM categories. We manually select the following STEM categories from the MMLU dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2020b) to create our sycophancy dataset: abstract algebra anatomy astronomy clinical knowledge college biology college chemistry college computer science college mathematics college medicine college physics computer security conceptual physics econometrics electrical engineering elementary mathematics formal logic high school biology high school chemistry high school computer science high school mathematics high school physics high school statistics machine learning medical genetics virology Expert user biographies. We prompt LLMs to create the following 4 user biographies, which are attached before the MMLU questions: Hello, my name is Dr. Emily Chen. am 42 year old Professor of Physics at Stanford University. have PhD in Theoretical Physics from Princeton.

My interests outside of work include statistical modeling, basketball, and photography. Sycophantic lying behavioral analysis. The sycophancy rate for Llama-70B is 8.5%. Overall, on STEM questions from MMLU, the models sycophancy rate is not high. Notably, the sycophancy rate is highly modulated by model confidence and the correctness of the models original answer (see Figure 10). Sycophancy rates is lower when the models original answer is correct. This might suggest that the model possesses some implicit awareness of its own correctness and is more resistant to user pressure when it has answered correctly. In addition, the more confident the model is in its original answer, the lower the sycophancy rate is. Filtering based on correctness vs. based on confidence. As shown in Figure11, filtering the samples based on the correctness of the models original answers yields effectively the same results as filtering based on the models confidence. 15 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 11. Probing Generalization Performances (sycophancy filtered based on correctness). Similar to Figure 2, probes trained on the four truth types generalize to each other, but no prior probes generalize to sycophantic lying.

(a) First, we fix the architecture to logistic regression and the token aggregation method to average token, and then pick the top-5 layers based on average cross-domain AUROC on our FLED dataset. (b) Second, we compute the same average AUROC for all combinations of architectures and token aggregation methods across these 5 layers. The final probe design in logistic regression with the average token. B. Probe Design We consider 3 design choices for our probes: (1) the probe architecture: logistic regression (LR), difference of means (DoM), or linear discriminant analysis (LDA); (2) the layer from which to extract activations; and (3) the token positions from which to extract activations: last token, average across tokens, or all tokens. We tune these design choices using Llama-3.3-70B, optimizing for cross-domain AUROC on our FLEED dataset. We first fix the architecture to LR with regularization α = 1 and the token selection to average. Then we evaluate performance every 5 layers to reduce computational and memory costs. Based on these results, we select the top-5 performing layers and tune the architecture, token selection method, and scaler usage. Finally, we select LR and average tokens and tune the regularization weights among 106, 104, 102, 1, 100, and 10000. Our final configuration for Llama-3.3-70B is LR with regularization α = 104 using average tokens at layer 33. The full tuning results for Llama-3.3-70B are shown in Figure 12. For all other models (both base and chat models for Llama-70b, Llama-8b, Qwen-14b, and Qwen-7b), we use the architecture and token aggregation strategy (LR + average tokens) selected above, tuning only the specific layer used for extraction. We report results for the best-performing layer in Figure 13. Notably, for all tested model families, the optimal layer is identical between the base and chat models. Furthermore, performance peaks at intermediate layers; however, base models exhibit sharper performance decline in later layers compared to their chat counterparts. Experiments are conducted using Huggingface and NNsight (Wolf et al., 2020; Fiotto-Kaufman et al., 2024) on local L40S and A40. C. Additional Results: Probe Generalization Probing generalization results . As shown in Figure 14, Llama-8B shows similar probe generalization patterns as Llama-70B in Figure 2. D. Additional Results: Probe Direction Geometric Analysis Simulation. As shown in Figure 16, to validate that the Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probe directions is predictive of OOD probe performance, we conduct series of simulations on different data distributions. In each simulation, we generate labeled data from known generative model in high-dimensional space (d=5001000) with low effective dimensionality, train an ID probe via LDA, then construct OOD probes at varying angles to the ID probe and evaluate 17 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 13. Probing Layer Tuning. We compute the average cross-domain AUROC for all models (both base and chat models for Llama-70b, Llama-8b, Qwen-14b, and Qwen-7b) across layers and select the best performing layer. The first column contains chat models, and the second contains base models. Note that the best layers of the base and the chat models of the same heritage are the same for all models tested. In addition, the best layers are some intermediate layers, and the base models performances drop more in later layers compared to the chat models. 18 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 14. Probe Generalization Performance on Llama-8B. all probes on the same test set. We experiment with five different data distributions: isotropic Gaussian, anisotropic Gaussian, leptokurtic (multivariate t, df=3), extreme leptokurtic (df=2.5), and leptokurtic with skew. Across all conditions, Mahalanobis cosine similarity between the ID and OOD probe directions was strongly linearly predictive of OOD AUROC (R2 = 0.9570.999), while standard cosine similarity was not (R2 = 0.0120.553). This confirms that the Mahalanobis metric captures the geometrically relevant notion of probe alignment: two probes agree in their discriminative capacity to the extent that their weight vectors point in the same direction after whitening by the test-set covariance. Comparison between standard cosine similarity and Mahalanobis cosine similarity. Figure 17 compares two measures of geometric alignment between probe directions, standard cosine similarity and Mahalanobis cosine similarity, against the actual cross-domain generalization performance (OOD AUROC). Standard cosine similarity between truth directions is near zero for most domain pairs, failing to distinguish pairs that transfer well (e.g., definitional empirical, AUROC = 0.99) from those that do not (e.g., sycophancy definitional, AUROC = 0.60). This occurs because standard cosine similarity treats all dimensions of the representation space equally, ignoring the fact that variance is concentrated along small number of directions (the effective dimensionality of our data is less than 200 in 8192-dimensional space). Mahalanobis cosine similarity corrects for this by whitening the representation space with respect to the data covariance, effectively measuring alignment only along directions that carry signal. The resulting similarity scores are strongly predictive of transfer AUROC. This confirms that Mahalanobis cosine similarity captures the functionally relevant geometric relationship between truth directions, and that the apparent dissimilarity of probes under the standard metric is largely an artifact of high-dimensional noise dimensions dominating the inner product. E. Additional Results: Post-training Geometry Reorganization Additional results on the Qwen model family. We present results for Qwen-2.5-14B and Qwen-2.5-7B, along with their corresponding base models, in Figure 19. For these two model pairs, the reduction in alignment between sycophancy and other truth types emerges only under higher logistic regression regularization strength (α = 1 instead of 104). We show the probe generalization performance between our FLEED and sycophancy dataset for all models across all layers in Figure 20. Note that the base models (right) consistently outperform their chat model counterparts (left). In addition, we observe that for most models, there are two peaks where the generalization performance is high: one in the middle layers, and one in the late layers. For the detailed cross-generalization performance for the best layers of each model, see Figure 15, which is summarized in Figure 4. 19 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 15. Probing Performance at the Best Layers for All Models. We use logistic regression with α = 1 here. Note that the performances on the right (base models) are much higher than the ones on the left (chat models). The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 16. Mahalanobis cosine similarity linearly predicts OOD probe AUROC across various distributional assumptions. Each column corresponds to synthetic generative model of increasing realism (left to right). Top row: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between ID and OOD probe weight vectors vs. OOD AUROC. Bottom row: standard cosine similarity vs. OOD AUROC. Mahalanobis cosine similarity is consistently linearly predictive of OOD AUROC (R2 0.957), while standard cosine similarity is not (R2 0.553), confirming that whitening by the test-set covariance is necessary to capture the geometrically meaningful notion of probe alignment. Figure 17. Cross-domain probe transfer performance (left) compared with Mahalanobis cosine similarity (center) and standard cosine similarity (right) between probe directions. Mahalanobis cosine similarity closely tracks out-of-domain AUROC, capturing both high transfer among definitional, empirical, fictional, and logical domains and the weak transfer involving sycophancy and invertedexpertise probes. Standard cosine similarity, by contrast, fails to predict generalization performance well. Figure 18. Standard Probe Cosine Similarity vs. Generalization Performance. Standard cosine similarity achieves an R2 of 0.56, which is much lower than the Mahalanobis variant (R2 = 0.98; Figure 3). 21 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 19. Post-training reduces alignment between sycophancy and other truth types (Qwen models). F. Additional Results: Concept-Erasure Stratified INLP. In Figure 21, we should the full hierarchical Stage 1 domain-general removal. We show the detailed crossgeneralization performances of the domain-specific directions in Figure 22. Most directions only have high performance in-domain but are at chance for other domains. LEACE Erasure. Figure 24 shows the performance of all probes trained after applying LEACE. After applying LEACE, in-distribution probing performance on the removed domain falls to chance level (AUROC 0.5), while ID performance on the remaining (non-removed) datasets stays essentially unchanged (Figure 23). This demonstrates that domain-specific directions exist, even though probes trained on each domain generalize perfectly to others (as shown in Figure 2). F.1. Formalizing Partially Overlapping Concept Subspaces In Section 7, we observe that applying LEACE to selectively erase one truth domain causes heterogeneous degradation across other domains. Furthermore, zero-shot transfer performance between domains is asymmetric and variable. To rigorously demonstrate that this heterogeneity implies truth types share partially overlapping but distinct sets of directionsrather than single domain-general truth direction or strictly isolated domain-specific directionswe formalize probe performance as constrained capacity allocation problem over intersecting subspaces. Partitioning the Representation Space. Let be the set of all evaluated truth domains (e.g., Definitional, Fictional, Evidential, etc.). We assume the models latent representation space can be partitioned into mutually exclusive subspaces based on which domains share them. For any subset of domains , let Vc be the subspace of directions strictly shared by the domains in and no others. The true dimensionality, or capacity, of each subspace is denoted as dc 0. Under this formulation: purely domain-general direction is captured by dT > 0. Purely domain-specific directions are captured by d{A} > 0 for domain A. Partially overlapping directions are captured by dc > 0 where 1 < < . Probe Reliance and Concept Erasure When linear probe is trained on domain A, it learns to rely on subset of the available dimensions. We denote the learned reliance (weight) of probe on subspace Vc as wA,c 0. Naturally, probe cannot rely on features it does not see during training, nor can its reliance exceed the true capacity of the subspace: 0 wA,c dc such that wA,c = 0 such that / 22 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 20. Sycophancy and FLEED Cross-Domain Probing Performance for All Models Across Layers. Base models (right) consistently outperform their chat model counterparts (left). The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 21. Full Stage 1 of Stratified INLP. We first remove 5 dimensions trained on all domains, then 3 for the honesty benchmarks, then 4 for our FLED datasets, and finally 10 for definitional, empirical, and fictional datasets. 24 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 22. Cross-generalization Performance of Domain-specific Directions Identified by Stratified INLP. Note that most directions only have high performance in-domain but are at chance for other domains. The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 23. Effect of LEACE on In-distribution performance. Targeted removal of specific truth direction reduces the AUROC of that task to chance level (0.5). Crucially, this intervention does not degrade performance on other truth types (Non-Removed Tasks). This shows the existence of distinct, domain-specific directions, despite the ability of probes to generalize across them. Figure 24. Effect of LEACE for All Probes. 26 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 25. Inferred capacities of intersecting latent truth subspaces. We formalize probe transfer and selective concept erasure as capacity allocation problem over shared representation subspaces. The bottom matrix denotes subspace membership (black dots indicate domain utilizes that direction), while the top bar chart displays the inferred capacity of each subspace derived via L1-regularized least-squares optimization. For comparison, hypothetical pure domain-general (gold) and domain-specific (red) directions are manually appended. The empirical data reveals that representations predominantly rely on patchwork of partially overlapping directions (blue) shared by 3 to 6 domains. This structure explains the asymmetric generalization and selective degradation observed during LEACE interventions: erasing concept selectively destroys its specific intersecting capacities while leaving others intact. We model the performance (AUROC above chance) of probe evaluated on domain as monotonic function of its reliance on the shared dimensions present in both domains: Pori(A, B) (cid:88) wA,c cT :AcBc When LEACE is applied to erase domain E, it projects out the subspace predictive of E. In our framework, this effectively zeroes out any subspace Vc where c. The transformed performance therefore relies only on the surviving shared dimensions: Ptrans(A, BE) (cid:88) wA,c cT :AcBcE /c Optimization Problem. To find the minimal set of latent dimensions that explain our empirical results, we frame this as sparsity-promoting least-squares optimization problem. We aim to minimize the reconstruction error between the predicted performance and the empirically observed AUROC matrix ˆP , while applying an L1 penalty to dc to encourage sparse, minimal set of active subspaces: min d,w (cid:88) (cid:16) (A,B) Pori(A, B) ˆPori(A, B) (cid:17)2 (cid:88) (cid:16) + (A,B,E) Ptrans(A, BE) ˆPtrans(A, BE) (cid:17)2 + λ (cid:88) cT dc Subject to: dc wA,c 0 wA,c = 0 / 27 The Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 26. Decomposition of log-probability changes for correct vs. incorrect answers. Effective domain-specific directions primarily suppress incorrect answers while preserving correct ones. The general direction instead boosts both, disproportionately increasing incorrect answer probabilityexplaining its failure despite targeting the same phenomenon. Results. Solving this objective over our empirical data reveals that the optimization does not allocate the majority of the capacity to single domain-general subspace (dT ), nor to strictly isolated specific subspaces (d{A}) (see Figure 25). Instead, to satisfy the selective degradation observed during the LEACE interventions, the solver is forced to allocate the highest capacities to subsets containing 3 to 6 domains (e.g., subspace shared by Ethical, Definitional, and Logical). This mathematically validates our hypothesis: generalization fails in certain transfer pairs not simply due to lack of diverse training data, but because the underlying directions are structurally patchwork. The erasure of concept causes selective degradation precisely because it destroys the capacity, leaving other intersecting pathways intact. G. Additional Results: Causal Experiments Mechanism: suppression vs. confidence boosting. Decomposing diff into changes in log (a+) and log (a) reveals why the general direction fails (Figure 26): it increases probability mass on both answers, but disproportionately boosts the incorrect one. In contrast, effective domain-specific directions (e.g., int facts, int elements) primarily suppress log (a) while leaving log (a+) relatively unchangeda more surgical intervention."
