Introduction Region-level captioning aims to describe specific region in natural language while highlighting its distinguishing features compared to other regions. Although previous approaches have shown strong performance in describing target regions, they have struggled to generate distinguishable captions across multiple granularities. For real-world applications, it is crucial to describe regions at any level of granularity. Despite its importance, generating unique captions across multiple levels of granularity remains underexplored. The primary challenges in multi-granularity captioning include accurately localizing the user-specified region and capturing its unique attributes (e.g., color, relative position, and shape) to clearly distinguish it from surrounding areas [30, 47, 50]. Furthermore, generating truly unique regional captions [35, 59] is particularly challenging, as most existing methods [19, 20, 36, 39, 57, 61, 65, 66] primarily describe target regions without sufficiently capturing their distinctive attributes regarding their contextual surroundings. Additionally, even though several studies [7, 28, 29, 42] have explored regional captioning, we find that they struggle to produce truly unique and contextaware captions due to limitations in both model design and dataset availability. Regarding model design, previous approaches [9, 31, 51, 63] have explored generating captions on salient regions by providing region coordinates through natural language descriptions [5, 29], marking regions directly on the image (e.g., mask contours, ellipses, bounding boxes, triangles, scribbles, points, arrows, and masks) [4, 41, 55], or utilizing visual RoI features [12, 16]. Although these methods have demonstrated notable performance, they come with several drawbacks on solving unique multi-granularity region captioning: they may alter the original image, make it difficult to distinguish between colored contours, and fail to capture global relationships within the image [43], ultimately hindering the models ability to generate unique captions. On the other hand, we show that the naıve use of existing captioning datasets [6, 14, 15, 18, 22, 31, 38, 39, 45, 49, 56, 61] is also incompatible with unique multi-granularity captioning. Existing datasets primarily focus on salient regions [39, 45, 49, 56] or rely on bounding box annotations [14, 31], which limits the models ability to describe less salient properties. Additionally, most captions in these datasets tend to be overly general [22, 38, 61] (e.g., person standing), leading to duplicate annotations for multiple regions within the same image. This lack of specificity prevents models from distinguishing similar regions effectively, ultimately hindering their ability to generate faithful descriptions of user-defined regions. As current datasets have not explored on both generating unique caption and considering multi-granularity, our paper first presents novel data curation pipeline on generating unique captions on multi-granularity regions. To generate unique captions for regions while considering their hierarchical relationships, our automated data curation pipeline annotates regions in stage-wise manner using mask tree structure. The mask tree captures hierarchical dependencies by representing subset and superset relationships among regions, as shown in Figure 2. By leveraging this structure, our pipeline efficiently generates unique captions for target regions based on their corresponding tree nodes. Utilizing our data pipeline, we propose URECA dataset, dataset tailored for unique captioning on multigranularity regions. Unlike previous captioning datasets [6, 14, 18, 22, 31, 38, 39, 45, 49, 56, 61] which are solely limited to salient regions within an image and contain simple descriptions, our dataset covers broader range of objects, parts, and backgrounds each with unique caption. Each caption in our dataset is uniquely mapped to single region, ensuring unique correspondence between regions and captions across various granularities. Based on our dataset, we then propose novel model architecture URECA, which effectively conditions regions of interest for the captioning model without losing the regions details. To consider multi-granularity regions, it is essential to encode various size of regions, which previous methods often struggled with [4, 12, 18, 60, 65]. To achieve this, we introduce mask encoder network and dynamic mask modeling approach that extracts mask features while preserving essential properties such as position and shape even on the multi-granularity regions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed URECA dataset and URECA in generating unique multi-granularity region captions, we"

While these datasets provide varying levels of detail, URECA dataset is the only dataset that offers distinctive dense captions and handles multi-granularity regions effectively. further validate our model on test set that has undergone an additional quality assurance stage to ensure the quality of the annotated captions produced by our automated pipeline. Notably, URECA achieves state-of-the-art performance on our URECA dataset test set while also demonstrating strong performance on traditional region-level captioning datasets such as Visual Genome [22] and RefCOCOg [56] datasets. We also show that further fine-tuning existing captioning models on URECA dataset enables better multi-granularity captioning. In summary, we make the following contributions: We introduce large-scale multi-granularity captioning dataset that ensures unique region-caption mapping by covering diverse range of objects, parts, and backgrounds beyond salient regions. We present novel captioning model designed to handle multi-granularity regions through dynamic mask modeling and high-resolution mask encoder that preserves essential region properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our test dataset and shows strong generalization on benchmark datasets, including Visual Genome [22] and RefCOCOg [56]. 2. Related Work Multi-modal large language model. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pioneering performance integrating diverse in instruction following capabilities, knowledge from extensive datasets, and performing complex reasoning tasks. However, significant limitation of LLMs is their reliance solely on natural language inputs. To address this, LLaVA [29] was the first to explore the integration of image and text modalities by representing visual features as visual tokens. Building upon this, models such as Flamingo [1] and BLIP-2 [26] have further advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating powerful visual backbones. These models effectively bridge the two modalities and have shown strong performance in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. Building on these advancements, recent efforts have aimed to extend these models to handle more complex tasks, including reasoning over segmentation [23, 40], optical character recognition [8, 48], and grounding [13, 37, 39, 49, 67]. Region-level vision language model. Although MLLMs have demonstrated impressive image understanding capabilities, generating captions for specified regions remains challenging task. LLaVA [29] and MiniGPT-2 [5] have explored conditioning given regions by translating bounding box coordinates into natural language. However, these models heavily rely on the MLLMs ability to interpret bounding box coordinates accurately. Other approaches [4, 41, 55] have attempted to overlay regions directly onto the image. While this method is straightforward to implement, it alters the original image, making it difficult for MLLMs to reference the unmodified content. To address this issue without modifying the original image, some methods have explored directly modeling the coordinates of the regions or feature pooling conditioned on bounding boxes [9, 31, 51, 63]. Although pooling features from the bounding box has improved performance, these approaches often struggle to accurately capture user intent, particularly when objects overlap. Mask-based feature pooling [12, 16] provides more precise localization information by avoiding ambiguous bounding box indications. However, it is typically performed on low-resolution image features and excessively aggregates information, leading to the loss of finegrained details such as shape and boundaries. In extreme cases, small-region masks in high-resolution images may disappear entirely during this process, resulting in the loss of meaningful features. Moreover, none of the prior works have effectively addressed the challenge of generating captions that precisely localize user-intended regions while capturing their unique attributes at any granularity. This is primarily due to the lack of suitable dataset and the absence of architectures designed for this task. To bridge this gap, we propose an automated data generation pipeline that ensures the inclusion of unique captions while considering multi-granularity regions. Additionally, our architecture effectively handles such multi-granularity regions, preserving their original attributes and capturing global relationships among regions. 3. URECA Dataset Previous research has made significant progress in generating dense region captions; however, approaches focusing on multi-granularity regions remain scarce. When considering the granularity of regions, distinguishing their unique attributes becomes crucial [30, 35, 47, 50], as visually similar regions frequently appear within an image. Existing approaches have struggled to generate truly unique captions for regions, often producing generic descriptions despite clear visual differences. This tendency to generate generic captions contradicts human perception, as humans naturally recognize and describe regions based on distinctive attributes like color, position, and shape. However, existing captioning datasets often lack such specificity, and training models on such generic captions that do not emphasize regional uniqueness can contribute to the mode collapse problem [50], where models fail to generate diverse and informative captions. To address this lack of specificity in existing datasets, we propose URECA dataset, dataset designed to enhance models ability to generate unique captions for given multigranularity regions. Our dataset is generated through an automated data pipeline that creates and verifies captions in stage-wise manner. Specifically, we build our dataset using the publicly available SA-1B dataset, which offers highresolution images and multi-granularity regions. To further ensure caption quality in the test set, we incorporate verification step using GPT-4o [32] as part of the pipeline. Data annotation pipeline. To generate unique captions that effectively capture multi-granularity, it is crucial to consider both target and non-target regions. Captions that focus solely on the target region often become overly localized and repetitive, making it difficult to distinguish between similar regions. To address this, we structure hierarchical relationships between regions, ensuring that captions incorporate broader contextual information. At the core of our approach is mask tree, constructed based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU). This hierarchical structure organizes regions into subset-superset relationships, allowing us to systematically capture dependencies between different regions. This hierarchical structure enables comprehensive understanding of region dependencies at both global and local levels, ensuring the generation of unique captions."

By comparing the IoU between masks, we can determine their relationships (i.e., superset or subset) within the hierarchy. 2. Top-down generation. To ensure that contextual information is effectively incorporated into each nodes caption, we generate captions in top-down manner. In this process, each node refers to its parent node to maintain hierarchical consistency. Specifically, we generate short captions using our annotation MLLM, InternVL2.5-38B [7], for each node by referring captions from the parent node and two types of images that represent the target region: cropped image of the target region with non-target areas blurred based on the mask [54], and cropped image of the parent region, where the target region is contoured while non-target areas within the parent region are blurred. 3. Bottom-up generation. To ensure that parent nodes have unique captions incorporating relevant details from their child nodes while maintaining contextual coherence, we generate captions in bottom-up manner. In this process, the parent node refers to its childrens captions to generate more informative and unique caption. Specifically, we aggregate the captions of all child nodes and use our annotation MLLM to generate refined caption based on the aggregated captions, the parent nodes short caption, and an image where the target region is contoured within the full image to preserve its spatial context. 4. Uniqueness refinement. To further ensure visually similar regions have distinguishable captions, we introduce uniqueness refinement process based on image feature similarity using DINOv2 [33]. In this stage, similarlooking regions are identified using image features and 4 Figure 2. Automated data curation pipeline of URECA dataset. Our pipeline consists of four key stages to generate unique captions for multi-granularity regions. In Stage 1, we construct mask tree that captures hierarchical relationships between regions. Stage 2 generates short captions based on the parent node. Stage 3 aggregates captions from child nodes, and Stage 4 ensures that each node is assigned unique caption. Best viewed in zoomed-in. marked in the image with contours and indexed bounding boxes [53]. Our annotation MLLM then generates unique caption by explicitly differentiating the target region from other visually similar regions. Data statistics. We conducted statistical comparison between previous captioning datasets and URECA dataset. Table 1 highlights their capabilities in region-level captioning. Simple caption refers to datasets [15, 38] that provide basic descriptions, often incorporating object classes in the captions. Dense caption represents datasets [29, 45] that include multiple attributes, offering more detailed descriptions of the region. Additionally, datasets [10, 22, 23, 42, 51, 56, 61] where captions are explicitly aligned with specific regions fall under the region caption category. As multi-granularity captioning becomes increasingly relevant for real-world applications, recent datasets [39, 49, 67] have started to incorporate this aspect. However, none of the existing datasets fully capture all these aspects with captions that describe distinctive attributes of the region while maintaining multi-granularity. Among them, URECA dataset stands out as unique dataset providing distinct dense captions while effectively handling multi-granularity regions. Evaluation set. To ensure the quality of the test dataset when evaluating unique captioning on multi-granularity regions, we additionally implemented verification stage during the test set generation process. As state-of-the-art MLLMs have demonstrated performance comparable to human annotators preferences [11, 24, 52], we utilized GPT1, 1gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 which is widely adopted to simulate human annotators for data generation tasks. Further details about the dataset pipeline can be found in Appendix. 4. URECA The overall architecture of URECA is illustrated in Figure 3. It builds upon the LLaVA [29] architecture, which treats visual features as tokens. Inspired by this approach, we adopt similar strategy by representing mask features as tokens. To achieve this, we integrate mask encoder that localizes the target region while preserving essential mask details such as size, position, and shape. 4.1. Mask Encoder To capture the distinctive features of target region, it is essential to leverage both local information and the global context of the image. representation of the region should function as localizer rather than constraint on the region. Additionally, the representation of the region should encode information such as size, position, and shape without ambiguity or loss. Masks inherently provide this capability, whereas previous methods such as contours, bounding boxes, and text coordinates do not. Therefore, encoding mask information without loss is crucial for generating dense and distinctive captions. To achieve this, we introduce mask encoder that exclusively encodes the mask without altering the original image, thereby preserving the masks unique attributes. Our mask 5 Figure 3. URECA architecture. URECA enables users to generate unique captions that describe distinctive attributes of any region. The mask encoder effectively encodes multi-granularity regions while preserving their identity. The mask token serves as localizer, guiding the LLM to generate region-specific captions based on the image and query token. encoder transforms the binary mask into sequence of tokens through multiple convolutional layers, resulting in set of mask tokens. These mask tokens are then integrated with image tokens within the MLLM, enabling the mask to function effectively as localizer while maintaining precise region-specific information. More precisely, our mask encoder performs as: = ϕ(M) RN D, (1) where {0, 1}HW denote the input binary segmentation mask, and and represent the height and width of the mask, respectively. The encoding process is performed by mask encoder, represented by the function ϕ(). Our mask encoder maps the binary mask to feature representation RN D, where denotes the number of spatial tokens, and is the feature embedding dimension. Unlike traditional mask feature pooling, our mask encoder tokenizes the mask without aggregation, preserving fine-grained spatial details and capturing multi-granularity regions. The resulting mask tokens contain both local and global details of the mask, enabling our model to accurately locate regions and generate clear, unique captions. 4.2. Dynamic Mask Modeling Naıvely using an encoder that receives fixed-size inputs requires mask resizing, leading to the loss of fine-grained region details. However, preserving these details is particularly important, as multi-granularity captioning relies on masks of diverse scales. Therefore, generating mask tokens directly from high-resolution inputs is essential. Thanks to the success of MLLMs that accept dynamiclength inputs, we leverage this capability in our mask modeling. To provide precise view during mask modeling and alleviate the challenges caused by extensive resizing, we propose dynamic masking which split the original highresolution mask into multiple sub-masks. This approach allows the length of mask tokens to be dynamically adjusted based on resolution, ensuring more accurate and flexible representation. Specifically, before passing the mask through the encoder, we first apply dynamic masking process to split the original mask {0, 1}HW into multiple sub-masks Msplit as follows: Msplit = Split(M) {0, 1}NsH . (2) These sub-masks are obtained by dividing the original mask into smaller regions, each having size of . The number of sub-masks Ns depends on the pre-defined splitting strategy. This process ensures that the mask encoder receives high-resolution and localizes information while preserving the global context of the original mask. The submasks Msplit are then passed through the mask encoder, resulting in the tokenized feature representation Fsplit RNsD, where is the feature embedding dimension. This dynamic masking step allows for finer localization of regions and helps capture multi-granularity features before encoding them into compact representation. 5. Experiments 5.1.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented baseline by running naıve MLLM [7] on URECA dataset. None refers to providing the MLLM with only the image, without any explicit region marking. Contour refers to marking regions within the image, and Crop involves providing the MLLM with cropped view of the target region. The results indicate that conditioning the MLLM solely on the image or natural language fails to localize regions effectively and generate unique captions. While previous region-level captioning models [4, 19, 31, 36, 63, 65] have demonstrated improved performance in generating unique captions when trained on URECA dataset, they lag behind URECA either because they struggle to localize multi-granularity regions, alter the original image, or overly constrain the target region without considering the global context. This underscores that fine-tuning existing captioning models on the URECA dataset enhances their ability to handle multi-granularity captioning. However, URECA surpasses these approaches by not only generating unique captions across an image but also effectively capturing multigranularity regions, demonstrating its capability to accurately represent regional information. Region-level captioning. In Table 3, we present the zeroshot performance of URECA on RefCOCOg [56] and Visual Genome [22]. On RefCOCOg, URECA demonstrated competitive performance, while on Visual Genome, it achieved state-of-the-art results compared to previous approaches. Notably, unlike prior methods, URECA achieves these results without using the benchmarks training sets, highlighting the strong generalization ability of URECA dataset. This suggests that URECA dataset covers diverse region granularities with well-aligned captions, enabling better regional understanding. By effectively learning from dataset with varying granularities, URECA effectively localizes and generates captions across different scales, making it highly adaptable to region-level captioning even on the zero-shot tasks. 5.2. Qualitative Results Figure 4 shows the qualitative results comparing URECA with other methods [4, 36, 65].Unlike the comparison models, which struggle to localize regions or generate captions that capture their distinctive attributes, URECA produces unique captions for each multi-granularity region.

It is well established that performance improves with larger foundation models [2, 7, 25, 62], as their knowledge capacity scales with model size. Our URECA follows this trend, achieving better performance as its size increases, as shown in Table 5. While the 1B model records the lowest performance, the largest model (8B) achieves the highest. in Table 4, the baseline MLLM without conditioning performs poorly. Incorporating our mask encoder, which effectively encodes the target region while preserving its identity, significantly enhances the models ability to localize regions and generate more descriptive captions. Furthermore, employing our dynamic masking strategy, which divides the original resolution into smaller sub-images, enables the mask encoder to capture finer details of target regions, further improving performance. Mask token length. We demonstrated that our mask encoder effectively captures regions while preserving their identity. To analyze the impact of the number of tokens generated by the mask encoder, we conduct an ablation study, as shown in Table 6. We investigate the effect of increasing the number of mask tokens. As the number of tokens increases, the representation becomes more detailed, allowing for finer details to be captured, particularly in smaller regions. 8 6. Conclusion We present URECA dataset, regional captioning dataset that includes multi-granularity regions. Our primary objective is to annotate regions with unique captions that exclusively describe the target region. To achieve this, we propose an automated data pipeline that generates distinctive captions using mask tree, which captures the hierarchical relationships between regions. To ensure high-quality evaluation, we introduce verification stage to validate the test set. Furthermore, we introduce URECA, which encodes masked regions while effectively preserving their identity. To retain finer details, we propose dynamic masking, leveraging the LLMs flexible input length to encode masks even in high-resolution views. Our URECA achieved state-ofthe-art performance on URECA dataset and demonstrates strong zero-shot captioning capabilities."

            "content": "A. Implementation Details We leverage InternVL-2.5 [7] along with our mask encoder, which consists of convolutional layers followed by twolayer MLP as the projection layer for mask tokens. For our experiments, we set the mask token length to 8. The input to the mask encoder is resized to 448448, and the dimension of the mask tokens matches the feature dimension of the MLLM. We train our model on four Tesla A100 GPUs (40GB) using LoRA [17]. Specifically, training is conducted in two stages: first, we train the mask encoder and projection layer, followed by LoRA fine-tuning of the MLLM. We use batch size of 16 for LoRA tuning. For evaluation, we adopt standard metrics used in previous studies, including BLEU [34], ROUGE [27], METEOR [3], and BERTScore [64]. B. Limitations While our mask encoder effectively encodes multigranularity regions without losing details, localizing the region in sequential manner may occasionally cause the MLLM to misidentify the target region. Since we do not explicitly constrain target regions using image features or direct markers, the localization signal provided to the MLLM may be weaker compared to previous methods. Enhancing region encoding by incorporating both the mask and additional image features, rather than relying solely on sequential conditioning, could improve the MLLMs ability to accurately localize the target region. C. More Qualitative Results We visualize more qualitative results of URECA with previous apporaches [4, 65] in Figure A. D. Dataset Visualization We provide visual examples of our dataset to illustrate its diversity and complexity. Figure showcases representative samples, highlighting key variations in object appearance, background context, and challenging scenarios. For optimal viewing, we recommend zooming in and viewing the figures in color to better observe fine details. E. Data Pipeline To generate unique regional captions with multi-granularity, we propose structured four-stage process: Stage 1: Mask Tree Construction. We first build mask tree for each image using masks from the SA-1B dataset [21]. Intersection over Union (IoU) between masks is computed to determine containment relationships. Each tree has root node representing the entire image, with subsequent nodes structured hierarchically based on these containment relationships. Stage 2: Top-Down Caption Generation. In this stage, we identify primary nodes directly under the root node, termed main objects, whose depth exceeds predefined threshold. Short captions are then hierarchically generated from these main objects downward through descendant nodes. Each node creates concise captions using contextual information from parent and sibling nodes to maintain coherence and uniqueness. Specific prompts used in this step are detailed in Table A. Stage 3: Bottom-Up Caption Refinement. Short captions generated in Stage 2 are expanded into detailed descriptions. Each node enriches its caption by incorporating information from child nodes, ensuring hierarchical consistency and comprehensive context. Prompts for this refinement stage are provided in Table B. Stage 4: Uniqueness Refinement. Finally, captions are refined by evaluating visual similarity between regions using DINO v2 [33]. Regions with high visual similarity have their captions adjusted by emphasizing distinguishing features, maintaining semantic relevance and uniqueness. Prompts for uniqueness refinement are described in Table C. Through these stages, we systematically generate multigranularity captions that accurately describe each region with clarity, context, and uniqueness in an automated manner. F. Discussion Evaluating unique caption generation for regional captioning tasks using traditional metrics such as BLEU [34], METEOR [3], ROUGE [27], and CIDEr [44] presents inherent limitations. These metrics primarily assess similarity to reference captions based on n-gram overlap, without distinguishing between essential and non-essential words. However, in unique captioning, it is crucial to generate descriptions that highlight distinctive attributes, ensuring that the caption effectively differentiates the target region from others. Existing evaluation methods treat all words 12 equally, failing to account for the importance of discriminative terms. As result, captions that successfully emphasize key distinguishing features may not receive high scores if their phrasing deviates from reference texts, even if they better serve the tasks objective. This limitation suggests the need for alternative evaluation approaches that better capture the quality and distinctiveness of unique captions. 13 Figure A. Qualitative results of the URECA and comparison models [4, 65]. Our model generates unique caption conditioned on multigranularity regions. 14 Figure B.
