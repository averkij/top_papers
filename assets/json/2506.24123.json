            "content": "The advertising and promotion industry, encompassing digital media, branding, packaging, and printed materials, relies on vivid and meticulously crafted typography to effectively communicate messages and solidify brand identity. Currently, designers often dedicate substantial time to manually fine-tuning fonts to achieve specific aesthetic objectives. This process is not only labor-intensive but can also introduce inconsistencies. Therefore, an automated method capable of generating text that emulates reference style while ensuring precise character positioning would significantly streamline the design workflow and enhance overall visual consistency, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Modern typography design, as illustrated in Fig. 2, predominantly employs two main categories of methods. The first category centers on the use of standardized font libraries [mdn web docs 1996]. While these libraries offer considerable accessibility, they often present challenges in seamless integration with diverse backgrounds and typically necessitate substantial manual adjustment to achieve specific aesthetic or artistic outcomes. The second branch of methods employs neural generative models [Huang et al. 2023; Mou et al. 2024; Yang et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2023b] to enable typography generation, editing, automating text modification, and font creation. Although promising, this technique frequently fails to capture the precise nuances of specific font styles or handle styles different from those in the source image, which are difficult to express through textual description. Our work bridges these gaps by enhancing generative techniques to automate the typography customization process while ensuring that the final output closely adheres to the desired visual style. Specifically, we propose diffusion-based framework to address data dependency and precise style control through three technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce self-distillation framework to construct style-oriented typography training dataset. This framework leverages the pre-trained text-to-image generative model in conjunction with large language model to synthesize comprehensive set of text images. These are processed and paired with corresponding reference images, prompts, and masks, thereby creating self-supervised training data that facilitates style learning without requiring manual annotation. Based on the aforementioned data generation pipeline, we propose style-centric text customization benchmark. This benchmark, inlcuding training and test sets, is expected to further boost the development of the typography research community. Secondly, local style injection mechanism is designed to employ trainable style encoder, including both Qformer [Li et al. 2023] and linear layers, to extract robust style-related features from references. By replacing cross-attention features in the denoising transformer network with these style embeddings, the method achieves granular typographic control in the latent space. Thirdly, an in-context generation mechanism directly integrates reference images into the denoising process. This integration significantly enhances the fidelity of style alignment between the generated output and the target references. These design elements enable our method to uniquely generate highly desirable text images that accurately reflect the style of reference inputs, even with arbitrary text or non-text images. Fig. 2. Motivation and technical differentiation of our approach. Existing typography design methods face critical limitations: (1) Standard font libraries prioritize accessibility but require extensive manual adjustments for integration into diverse backgrounds, resulting in inflexible and unrealistic outputs. (2) Neural generative models automate typography but often fail to capture precise font style nuances, especially when relying on textual descriptions. In contrast, the proposed method addresses these challenges by enabling fully automated typography generation with precise style control and various kinds of references, including non-text images. Overall, we construct and propose style-centric text customization benchmark based on the self-distillation strategy, specifically addressing the critical need for the model learning and standardized evaluation in this field. The proposed model learned on the training set of this benchmark achieves success in text customization with various kinds of references, and has been extensively evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods, including user studies, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics compared to existing approaches. Further results also suggest the model also could be applied to the task of reference-based generation without tuning. Our work represents significant step toward automated, efficient, and artistically driven typography design, with substantial potential applications in both design and branding processes, potentially revolutionizing workflows in creative industries by reducing manual labor while maintaining artistic integrity."

            "content": "Visual text rendering. Visual text rendering has been longstanding research problem in the era of generative AI. Traditional image generation models such as Stable Diffusion [Rombach et al. 2022a], Imagen [Saharia et al. 2022], and DALL-E [Ramesh et al. 2021] have fallen short in accurately rendering text. Consequently, some researchers have resorted to incorporating additional conditions into the generation process [Chen et al. 2023b,a, 2024, 2025; Ji et al. 2023; Jiang et al. 2025; Koo et al. 2025; Liu et al. 2022, 2024a,b; Ma et al. 2024, 2023; Tuo et al. 2024, 2023; Wang et al. 2025; Zhao and Lian 2023; Zhao et al. 2024]. For instance, GlyphDraw [Ma et al. 2023] introduces two diffusion branches: one for determining the text location and another for the actual text generation. While this approach somewhat alleviates the issues associated with text rendering, it remains limited to single-line text generation. TextDiffuser series [Chen et al. 2023a, 2024] seeks to address this limitation by using Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle text positioning tasks, thereby extending capabilities to multi-line text rendering. AnyText [Tuo et al. 2024, 2023] introduces the generation of multi-language text images. Brush Your Text [Zhang et al. 2024] utilizes the canny map of text template as condition, achieving Calligrapher: Freestyle Text Image Customization 3 Fig. 3. Self-distillation pipeline for style-oriented typography dataset construction and model training. We emulate natural language processing practices by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image generative models and large language models to synthesize stylized text images, paired with reference prompts and masks. This generates self-supervised training pairs for robust style learning without manual annotation. higher accuracy in multi-language rendering, though it falls short in terms of diversity. Overall, while existing efforts have focused on improving the accuracy of text rendering, the challenge of rendering controllable text remains substantial. Overall, although existing work has focused on the accuracy of text rendering, there is still significant need to create more visually appealing and controllable text. This is the main focus of our research. Text attributes customization. Early work has focused on font attribute customization [Gal et al. 2022; Hayashi et al. 2019; He et al. 2024a,a,c, 2023; Kondo et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2024]. For example, Attribute2Font [Wang et al. 2020] can automatically generate font styles by synthesizing visually pleasing glyph images based on user-specified attributes with corresponding values. However, compared to font stylizing, the task of customizing scene text attributes [He et al. 2024b; Paliwal et al. 2024; Su et al. 2023; Tuo et al. 2024] is more challenging due to complex factors such as perspective distortions and unique textures in scenes. For instance, MetaDesigner [He et al. 2024b] is system that uses LLMs to facilitate the creation of customized artistic typography. It employs multi-agent framework enhanced by feedback loop from multimodal models and user evaluations, to produce aesthetically pleasing and contextually relevant WordArt that adapts to user preferences. AnyText2 [Tuo et al. 2024] explicitly designs font encoder and color encoder, providing additional style-related guidance during the rendering process. However, it is typically limited to generating simple fonts and struggles in producing artistic typography nor following the given styles, and occasionally generates blurred results. We believe that accommodating free-style fonts can make the visuals more dynamic and engaging. Image style transfer. Image style transfer has been longstanding research problem [Bai et al. 2024; Chen et al. 2017, 2021; Chung et al. 2024; Frenkel et al. 2024; Gal et al. 2022; Hertz et al. 2024; Isola et al. 2017; Karras et al. 2019, 2020; Kotovenko et al. 2019; Kwon and Ye 2022; Ouyang et al. 2025; Patashnik et al. 2021; Shah et al. 2024; Sohn et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2021, 2023; Zhang et al. 2023a, 2022; Zhu et al. 2017]. Within this domain, various methods have been proposed to tackle the challenge of transferring the style from one image to another. Pix2Pix [Isola et al. 2017] models style transfer as low-level CNN prediction task, treating it as an image-to-image translation within conditional GAN framework, where the model is trained on paired images to directly predict the transformation from content to style at the pixel level. On the other hand, CycleGAN [Zhu et al. 2017] employs cycle consistency loss to enable style transfer in scenarios with unpaired images, using GAN-based loss that encourages the model to generate images that are indistinguishable from real images in the target style domain. InstructPix2Pix [Brooks et al. 2023] is built on top of the Stable Diffusion [Rombach et al. 2022a], enabling the usage of text prompt to conduct style transfer trained on curated paired images. Our main focus is to transfer the style of text based on reference image and additional guidance such as color palette. Generally, text areas are relatively small, and there are also some minor stroke details that require precise rendering, which makes this task particularly challenging."

In this section, we first discuss the motivation in Section 3.1, followed by the three carefully designed design components: The self-distillation learning strategy to cope with data scarcity is introduced in Section 3.2.

Scarcity of artistic typography data. significant challenge in this domain is the limited availability of large-scale datasets dedicated to artistic typography. Our observations indicate that current diffusion models [Black-Forest-Labs 2024a] are capable of synthesizing high-quality stylized text when paired with robust post-processing and careful selection. We propose incorporating the model to generate synthesized artistic typography benchmark and employ self-distillation training strategy that leverages highquality synthesized dataset to effectively transfer artistic styles, as elaborated in Section 3.2. Failure to capture subtle font details. Existing methods often rely on global stylization techniques that are insufficient for capturing shapes and textures, focusing only on the task of self-reference inpainting. To address this limitation, we introduce novel training pipeline that emphasizes localized style injection. This pipeline concentrates on fine-grained detail refinement, and yields more 4 Fig. 4. Training framework of Calligrapher, demonstrating the integration of localized style injection and diffusion-based learning. The framework processes masked images through Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to obtain latent representations, concatenated with mask and noise latents. style encoder comprising visual encoder, Qformer, and linear layers is designed to extract style-related features from the reference style image, while text embeddings (e.g., gic in the case) modulate the denoising transformer.

            "content": "Unlike image translation tasks in ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023b], acquiring high-quality supervised training data for text style transfer remains challenging [Black-Forest-Labs 2024a,b; Ye et al. 2023] due to the prohibitive cost and effort required to manually curate large-scale datasets of text pairs, which exhibit identical semantic content but distinct stylistic attributes. Furthermore, such datasets require diverse and sufficiently rich stylistic variations to enable models to robustly capture nuanced style features and adapt to complex style transfer scenarios. With the finding that modern generative models [Black-Forest-Labs 2024a] could produce text images with desirable quality, we draw inspiration from recent advances in self-training paradigms within large language model (LLM) research [Huang et al. 2022], where robust generative model is adopted to yield data to train itself. As in Fig. 3, our proposed framework introduces novel methodology where the pretrained generative model is employed to: (1) synthesize stylistically consistent training data through controlled generation, and (2) refine the style transfer model using the self-generated corpus. This approach establishes learning system that effectively leverages the internal knowledge representation of generative models while circumventing the dependency on human-annotated paired examples. Specifically, as in Fig. 3, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse set of semantic-coherent prompts 洧녷 annotated with explicit typographic style descriptors (e.g., 3D metallic text, watercolor calligraphy). These style-conditioned prompts are subsequently fed into the flow-matching diffusion model G洧랚 [BlackForest-Labs 2024a], to synthesize high-fidelity stylized text images through iterative denoising processes. To construct training pairs from the synthesized corpus, we first adopt the neural text understanding method [AI 2023] to detect the text locations and employ strategic cropping mechanism that preserves typographic consistency while enabling effective self-supervision. For each generated image, we randomly crop local region containing stylized characters as the reference style exemplar, while maintaining the remaining text region as the target for style transfer learning. Based on the aforementioned data generation pipeline, we establish and propose style-centric text customization benchmark to benefit the development of the community. The details of this stylized typography benchmark can be found in the data webpage. To formalize the task, let represent the main inputs of the text customization task that include the image latent, mask, and noise latent, while stands for the reference image. The proposed data generation strategy allows the model to efficiently learn to capture localized stylistic patterns and generate target text images from Gaussian noise 洧 (0, I), via the flow matching objective [Esser et al. 2024]: x0洧녷 (x0 ),洧N (0,I) (cid:2)洧랝(洧노) 洧냥 (x洧노 , 洧노, 洧녷, y) x0 2 2 (cid:3) , (1) min 洧랚 where 洧냥 (x洧노 , 洧노, 洧녷, y) = x洧노 洧노 G洧랚 (x洧노 , 洧노, 洧녷, y) as in [Esser et al. 2024], 洧노 stands for the timestep, xt denotes noisy inputs at 洧노, and 洧랝(洧노) indicates the loss weighting.

To extract initial features from the reference, we instantiate the style encoder with pre-trained multi-modal visual encoder [Zhai et al. 2023] and another encoder composed of linear layers and Qformer [Li et al. 2023] with learnable query parameters to transform these features into the key and value matrices. The fusion function is instantiated as feature replacement and cross-attention. The key and value matrices predicted from the style encoder are then injected into the main branch D, by replacing the original Key and Value matrices in the style attention module of the single block, as in Fig. 4: StyleAttention(洧녟 D, 洧쬔, 洧녤E ) = softmax (cid:33) (cid:32) 洧녟 D洧 洧녬洧 洧녤E, (3) where 洧녬洧 indicates the tensor dimension.

            "content": "Self-reference text image customization. One of the applications of our method is to modify the text content in the input image following the original text style. As shown in Fig. 5(a), our approach allows for the editing of text content while preserving the original text style, achieved by simply modifying the relevant descriptions in the input text prompt. For example, given an input image, our approach manages to inpaint the Eugenia to Infatuate, Willie to Garden ( Fig. 5(a)). The background of the input and output images remains consistent. Considering previous works are only enable to perform this mentioned task of self-reference customization (inpainting), we conduct quantitative and qualitative comparisons under this setting in the latter sections. We also demonstrate the further unique capabilities of our model beyond this setting. Fig. 6. Qualitative comparisons on self-reference customization. Calligrapher achieves better performance in terms of style sync and quality. Cross-reference text image customization. Cross-reference text customization aims to edit the text content using the reference with different style, which has never been demonstrated in previous methods [Chen et al. 2023a; Tuo et al. 2023]. In Fig. 5(b), we present various customization results given different styles of reference text images. Our approach is capable of generating style-aligned images while ensuring the controllability of the text. On the other hand, we empirically find that, the text customization model also works well when non-text images serve as the reference, such as images of fire, rainbows, and lightning. As in Fig. 5(c), our approach generates text that well aligns with these styles. The generated image also maintains high level of background consistency and achieves impressive aesthetic quality. Calligrapher: Freestyle Text Image Customization 7 Fig. 7. Ablation studies on the self-distillation (left) and in-context generation (right) to validate their effectiveness. Reference-based text image generation. Furthermore, we make efforts to achieve additional global controllable tasks of referencebased text image generation, where the input in Eq. (2) only includes the noise latent. We find the style encoder trained based on the original main branch (FLUX-fill [Black-Forest-Labs 2024b]) works with the new main branch of FLUX [Black-Forest-Labs 2024a], which could enable reference-based text image generation without further training and suggests the generalization of the learned model as in Fig. 5(d). This may be attributed to the parameter similarity between these two base models. 4.3 Comparison with baselines Quantitative results. For quantitative evaluation, we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods on the test set of our typography benchmark, which includes 100 text images with masks, prompts, and corresponding references. FID [Heusel et al. 2017] is adopted to evaluate the general quality and similarity of the whole images following prior arts. We also compute the style similarity of the text images within masked regions respectively, with the CLIP ViT-base [Radford et al. 2021] and DINO-v2 [Oquab et al. 2023] models. For the OCR metrics, we utilize the Google Cloud text detection API [Google-Cloud-API 2025] to recognize the content and calculate the accuracy of generated text. Results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best in terms of all metrics. The user study, conducted with 30 participants yielding over 1000 votes, provides results including three sub-domain scores (on scale of 1-4) and an overall preference percentage, which further demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance. Qualitative results. Qualitative comparisons with TextDiffuser2 [Chen et al. 2024], AnyText [Tuo et al. 2023], and FLUX-fill [BlackForest-Labs 2024b] are shown in Fig. 6, TextDiffuser-2 struggles in synthesizing the correct characters and styles. AnyText also generates text images in an undesirable style and low visual quality. It occasionally generates incorrect characters such as Ninja and Magnify. FLUX-fill [Black-Forest-Labs 2024b] demonstrates competent lexical accuracy but suffers from stylistic inconsistency, whereas the proposed method achieves substantial superiority in both dimensions. Compared to existing methods, Calligrapherdemonstrates significant advantages in terms of textual correctness and style consistency. notable example is the distinctive pattern of the letters in the reference word SPELLBOUND where our method maintains superior glyph integrity and stylistic coherence during generation."

Effectiveness of in-context generation. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the in-context strategy during the inference stage.
