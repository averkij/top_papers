            "content": "Identifying the good and bad generations is the key to the success of RLVR to improve LLMs abilities on structured rule-based tasks such as mathematical problem-solving (Ahn et al., 2024), classification (Rouzegar and Makrehchi, 2024), and game planning (Shao et al., 2019). RL algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) excel in mathematical problem-solving tasks by leveraging clear, rule-based reward signals (e.g., correctness) that effectively distinguish between correct and incorrect responses (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). However, despite these advances, extending GRPO to open-ended, long-form text generation tasks, such as writing poem, creative compositions, instruction-following, remains largely underexplored. key challenge in applying GRPO to open-ended generation is the lack of objective evaluation criteria, making it difficult to distinguish high-quality responses from poor ones. (Krishna et al., 2021). Unlike structured tasks evaluated by explicit correctness criteria, long-form generation requires models to balance coherence, fluency, and informativeness which are all subjective dimensions that are hard to define with discrete rules. This makes reward design fundamental challenge in GRPO: How do we guide model to write better, not just longer? key barrier is the lack of reliable, scalable evaluation methods. Traditional metrics like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020)which measure lexical or embedding-level similarity to referenceoften fail to capture qualities that humans actually care about, such as clarity, relevance, and stylistic appropriateness (Chen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2024). Thus, traditional metrics correlate poorly with human preferences, making them unreliable reward signals in GRPO pipelines. Recent work has applied general reward models (GRM) (Lambert et al., 2024) in RLHF to select preferred responses, but they are not designed as verifiable rewards for GRPO, and their large size introduces latency and high computational cost. As shown in Figure 1, traditional metrics fail to distinguish between clearly better and worse responses, assigning similar scores to both, while GRM rewards often correlate with length rather than content quality. To address open-ended evaluation in GRPO, we propose PrefBERTa lightweight ModernBERT (Warner et al., 2024) model trained on diverse long-form responses and human ratings to provide fine-grained quality evaluation. We hyFigure 1: Our proposed reward model PrefBERT better reflects human judgments by distinguishing the good responses from the bad ones than other traditional metrics, generalized reward model. pothesize that PrefBERT, by capturing human preferences, quality, and semantics, provides stronger reward signals than traditional metrics, enabling GRPO to train models that generate higher-quality responses. Through extensive evaluationsincluding LLMas-a-judge point-wise scoring, pairwise BradleyTerry ranking analyses (Bradley and Terry, 1952), and human rating and qualitative evaluationwe show that leveraging stronger, PrefBERT significantly enhances the quality of open-ended text generation across three long-form datasets ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019), Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023b), LongForm (Köksal et al., 2023). Our results show that using improved fine-grained evaluators as reward signals in GRPO leads to better alignment with human preferences for open-ended response generation compared to traditional metric-based rewardsand. Furthermore, smaller models (e.g., Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025)) trained with our enhanced reward models generate similarly preferred and concise responses as their larger counterparts (e.g., Qwen-2.5-32/72B-Instruct), and outperform models trained with traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in preference quality. Our contributions are: We introduce PrefBERT, lightweight longform reward model that can be easily extended to GRPO training. We validate using PrefBERT in GRPO to train models on across multiple open-ended generation benchmarks (ELI5, Alpaca, LongForm), showing resulting model have an overall higher alignment with human preferences compared to traditional metrics and SFT training. Through human expert annotations, we further confirm that models trained with PrefBERT align better with human preferences than traditional metrics as rewards, showing promising direction for using GRPO to improve openended generation."

            "content": "RL for LLM alignment: RL is pivotal in aligning LLMs with human preferences by optimizing non-differentiable objectives, making it valuable for tasks like dialogue (Li et al., 2016), summarization (Roit et al., 2023), and code generation (Le et al., 2022). Popular RLHF methods include DPO, which applies classification loss over preference data, and PPO, which trains reward model to guide generation (Wu et al., 2023). However, both of them require substantial human-annotated data or computational resources. To address this, GRPO (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) leverages selfgenerated data and simple, verifiable reward functions to reduce annotation needs, especially for tasks with clear correctness signals like math(Liu et al., 2025). Extensions such as DAPO(Yu et al., 2025), GRPO-LEAD(Zhang and Zuo, 2025) and DISCO (Zhou et al., 2025b) broaden GRPOs capabilities in math problem solving. However, these approaches still rely on rule-based reward designs, leaving their application to open-ended, long-form generation taskswhere there is not fixed correct responseunderexplored. Free-form and open-ended evaluation: Evaluating long-form and open-ended generation in LLMs remains difficult (Krishna et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2019). Unlike short-form tasks with clear correctness signals, long-form outputs, like summaries, dialogues, or open-ended answers, lack binary ground truths and require assessing coherence, factuality, structure, and helpfulness (Chiang et al., 2024; Fabbri et al., 2021; Li et al., 2025a). Traditional metrics such as ROUGE(Lin, 2004), BLEU(Papineni et al., 2002), and BERTScore(Zhang et al., 2020) rely on token overlap or embeddings but poorly reflect semantic or pragmatic qualities, often misaligning with human judgments(Chen et al., 2019). To overcome this, LLM-as-a-judge offers more nuanced evaluation through pairwise comparisons or Likert ratings, aligning better with human preferences (Chiang et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2025a). However, this approach introduces heavy computational costs, especially in GRPO where multiple generations and evaluations per prompt are needed (Luo et al., 2025), limiting accessibility for users with modest resources. Some efforts fine-tune small models using human ratings to act as open-source judges (Kim et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2020; Zhou and Ai, 2024), useful for ranking or evaluation (Li et al., 2024; Krumdick et al., 2025). Still, few explore using them as verifiable rewards in training, leaving this an open area for research."

            "content": "GRPO is an RL algorithm designed to refine language model policies, πϕ, using reward signals contextualized within group of candidate responses. Given prompt from dataset D, GRPO samples responses yi = y1, . . . , yG from the old policy πϕold(yx). Each response yi is assigned scalar reward r(x, yi) (detailed in the following subsections). The group-normalized advantage A(x, yi) is then computed as: A(x, yi) = r(x, yi) r(x) σr(x) , (1) where r(x) = 1 j=1 r(x, yj) and σr(x) are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of rewards r(x, yj) within the group . This normalization contextualizes each advantage relative to the groups current performance. The new policy πϕ(yx) is optimized by maximizing the GRPO objective, which combines clipped surrogate loss with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) against reference model πref(yx) for regularization (Equation 5, in Appendix A). Although originally applied to tasks with explicit, rule-based rewards (e.g., correctness or win/loss), GRPOs reliance on advantage estimation and KL-regularized updates allows it to learn from scalar feedback, making it well-suited for open-ended tasks where response quality lies on spectrum rather than binary correctness."

            "content": "Current scoring methods for open-ended generation mainly fall into two categories. The first are reference-based metrics, method commonly used in natural language generation. These methods score the generations over metrics like string overlap or embedding similarity. While easy to apply, they correlate poorly with human preferences on long-form outputs (Chen et al., 2019, 2020; Kim et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b). The alternative is to use LLMs as evaluators, which compute scores via pairwise preference prompts, Likert-scale tuning (Kim et al., 2024), or general reward models (GRMs) trained on preference data (Lambert et al., 2024). While more adaptive to human preferences, they may still inherit biases from their training data. In our work, we adopt two reference-based metrics, ROUGE and BERTScore, and one reward modelbased method, GRM-LLaMA-3B, as baselines. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is reference-based metric that measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference texts. Variants include ROUGE1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, which capture unigram/bigram matches and the longest common subsequence, respectively. BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) is referencebased metric that measures semantic similarity between the reference and generation using contextual embeddings. It has shown stronger correlation with human judgments than token overlap metrics like ROUGE on long-form generation and translation tasks. However, its reliability diminishes on modern datasets and models (Bhandari et al., 2020). Generalized Reward Model (GRM-LLaMA-3B) is reference-free, LLM-based reward model (Yang et al., 2024), fine-tuned on the decontaminated Skywork preference dataset (Liu et al., 2024). Each data point includes an input prompt, preferred response (yc), and rejected response (yr). The model is trained to favor preferred outputs by minimizing Bradley-Terry-style loss (Bradley and Terry, 1952) (Equation 6, Appendix A)."

            "content": "While traditional metrics often fail to capture human preferences, reward models can be computationally expensive to scale due to the size of the underlying models. To balance quality and efficiency, we propose PrefBERT, lightweight reference-based model with only 150M parameters, to offer fine-grained reward signals while maintaining training efficiency. Creating training data for PrefBERT: Each training example has reference answer, generated answer, and Likert score from 1-5 that rates the quality of the generated answer against the reference. To ensure balanced quality ratings across both long and short free-form responses, we incorporate training data from the Prometheuspreference (Kim et al., 2024) and MOCHA (Chen et al., 2020).1 We combine the two datasets and split them into 80% for training and 20% for testing. The resulting training set contains 19K examples substantially smaller than the 80K examples used to train GRM-llama-3B. Training BERT (Warner PrefBERT: We et train Modernal., 2024) on triplets 1Specifically, Prometheus-preference contains 200K finegrained Likert preference ratings spanning ten categories of evaluation including e.g. adaptive communication, emotional intelligence; the data is primarily long free-form answers where each answer is above 150 tokens. MOCHA contains mid to long length answer evaluation data to judge the overall correctness of the generated response. , xgen (xref first normalize each gold Likert score to , si) where si {1, . . . , 5}. We ri = si 1 4 [0, 1], where si is the gold Likert scale, ri is the normalized Likert score on the [0, 1] scale, xref is the reference answer, and xgen is the generated response. Thus, given xref and xgen, we concatenate them as single string: xpair = [CLS] xref [SEP] xgen, (2) where xpair is the input string feeds into ModernBERT. Let hi Rd be the pooled ModernBERT embedding of xpair. linear regressor plus sigmoid yields prediction rˆi = σ(whi + b), (3) where Rd and are the regressor weights and bias, σ(z) = 1/(1 + ez) is the sigmoid activation. rˆi (0, 1) is the predicted normalized score, and is taken as the reward signal of GRPO.

ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019) is collection of questions and answers from Reddits r/explainlikeimfive community.3 We sample 10,444 questions as the train set and 1,056 as the test set. 2Examples in Table 4. 3https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/ Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023a) is collection of 52K instruction-response pairs generated by OpenAIs text-davinci-003 in the style of SelfInstruct (Wang et al., 2022).

We use two base models, Qwen2.51.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025). In the training prompt, we encourage models to be factual, relevant, clear, concise, and complete (more details in Appendix Table 5).4 Supervised Finetuning (SFT): Using the reference responses as ground truth, we run SFT on Qwen2.5-Instruct size 1.5B and 3B."

Overall, models trained with our lightweight PrefBERT performs competitively with those trained with the much larger GRMllama-3B, and both substantially outperform models trained with token-overlap metrics or SFT. In addition, PrefBERT-trained models at 1.5B and 3B scale rival or exceed the performance of Qwen2.57B-Instruct, despite having far fewer parameters. 4All GRPO models are trained on 4 A6000 GPUs for one epoch, with global batch size of 128, group size of 4, and learning rate of 1e-6. We set both max prompt length and max generation length to 1024. 5All SFT models are trained on 4 A6000 GPUs for three epochs, with with global batch size of 128, learning rate of 1e-5, and max tokens of 4096. 5.1 Evaluation Metrics Point-wise evaluation: Point-wise evaluation assigns an absolute overall quality score to each response on Likert scale (Fabbri et al., 2021). We use GPT-4 as judge to first provide some reasoning, then assign score between 1 to 5 to the generated response, considering aspects like factuality, relevance, clarity and organization, conciseness, and completeness (detailed prompt in Table 7).6 We use two metricsmean Likert score (the average overall score) and success rate (the percentage of responses that receive score 4)to evaluate the quality of model responses. Pairwise preference evaluation: From the Likert scores, we derive pairwise comparisons to compute BradleyTerry win rates. This approach reduces rating noise by focusing on relative preferences rather than absolute scales, which has been shown to yield more reliable comparisons in subjective evaluation settings (Bai et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2022). For each prompt, we compare the LLM ratings between every pair of models. tie is recorded when both receive the same rating, and win is assigned to the model with the higher rating. We use the Bradley-Terry model to compute the probability win rate of each model on the three datasets."

However, PrefBERT is more efficient, having 20 times fewer parameters and was trained on only 19K examples, compared to 80K for GRM-llama-3B. In addition, as discussed later in Section 6.2, human evaluations reveal that GRM-llama-3B models tend to produce long and overly verbose outputs, which likely inflate their scores in Table 1 due to LLM judges bias toward longer responses. 6Chiang and yi Lee (2023b) shows that first analyze the response then give rating score yields the best correlation with human judgments.

Groupings show comparisons between SoTA baselines,RL-finetuned models using various reward functions, and supervised finetuning (SFT). Larger models are generally stronger, though models fine-tuned with better-aligned reward functions (e.g., GRM-llama-3B) may show inflated automatic metrics due to biases like verbosity. PrefBERT-trained models rival much larger models. Despite their smaller size, PrefBERTtrained models at 1.5B and 3B scale match or exceed the performance of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across all metrics. For example, 3B-PrefBERT outperforms Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct in Likert score (3.98 vs. 3.69), success rate (70.70% vs. 59.10%), and win rate (11.56% vs. 6.37%). While Qwen2.532B and 72B are stronger overall, these results highlight how well-aligned reward model can enable smaller LLMs to compete with much larger ones on open-ended long-form generations. The pattern that using semantic verifiable reward for training produces better policy models than using traditional metric-based rewards in long-form generation remains consistent across model sizes. Models trained with standard metrics, such as 1.5B-ROUGE-L and 1.5B-BERTScore, perform worse across all evaluation dimensions compared to 1.5B-PrefBERT and 1.5B-GRM-llama3B; this trend also holds for the 3B model sizes. SFT underperforms across the board. Policy models trained with SFT achieve lower scores across all evaluation dimensions than all models trained with GRPO, regardless of the reward used, except for 1.5B-BERTScore. Their success and win rates are the lowest across all datasets. Even the small 1.5B-PrefBERT and 1.5B-GRM-llama-3B substantially outperform the 3B-SFT model on average Likert score by around 1.1, success rate by 50%m and Bradley-Terry win rate by 6%. 5.3 Reward Learning Curves We examine the reward learning curves of models trained with the four types of rewards. Reward curves in Figure 2 during GRPO training show key differences across reward functions. Traditional metrics show minimal reward change, only 0.05 for ROUGE-L and 0.25 for BERTScore, indicating limited model improvement across all global training steps. In contrast, 3B-GRM-llama-3Bs reward is strongly correlated with response length; by step 60, it already generates the maximum allowed tokens (1,024), causing reward values to plateau around 0.6. PrefBERT shows more meaningful reward progression, not strictly tied to length, suggesting it favors responses of an optimal length rather than simply longer outputs."

To better assess output quality, we conducted human evaluation of responses from seven models: Qwen2.5-72BInstruct, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, 3B-GRM-llama-3B, 3B-PrefBERT, 3B-RougeL, 3B-BERTScore, and 3BSFT. Human preferences largely align with LLMas-a-judge rankings, except for 3B-GRM-llama-3B, whose overly verbose answers lower its human scores. Among the 3B models, 3B-PrefBERT is the top performer. Additionally, we observe that SFT models often produce shallow outputs, whereas GRPO models, trained with strong verifiable reward Figure 2: Reward curves during GRPO training show key differences across reward functions. Traditional metrics show minimal reward changeonly 0.05 for ROUGE-L and 0.25 for BERTScoreindicating limited model improvement across all global training steps. In contrast, 3B-GRM-llama-3Bs reward is strongly correlated with response length; by step 60, it already generates the maximum allowed tokens (1,024), causing reward values to plateau around 0.6. PrefBERT shows more meaningful reward progression, not strictly tied to length, suggesting it favors responses of an optimal length rather than simply longer outputs. signals, better leverages the models internal capabilities to produce higher-quality responses."

            "title": "6.2 Results and Qualitative Analysis",
            "content": "Table 2 shows that Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct achieves the highest average human Likert rating (3.61) and success rate (57%), followed by 3B-PrefBERT with rating of 3.36 and 51% success rate. In contrast, 3B-BERTScore and 3B-ROUGE-L perform only slightly better than the 3B base model, each improving success rates by approximately 3%. 3BPrefBERT, however, achieves much larger gain of around 10%. 3B-SFT receives the lowest human rating, while 3B-GRM-llama-3B ranks second to last in both Likert score and win rate. Except for 3B-GRM-llama-3B, the human evaluation results align closely with the rankings produced by LLM-as-a-judge, supporting the reliability of our automatic evaluation. We elaborate on these human evaluation findings below. Annotators strongly prefer 3B-PrefBERT. In general, we observe consistent ranking between human expert judgments and the rankings produced by LLM-as-a-judge. However, 3B-GRM-llama-3B is notable outlier. While it has the highest scores from LLM judges across all GRPO-trained models  (Table 1)  , annotators consistently rank it low  (Table 2)  . As shown in Table 3, 3B-GRM-llama3B is excessively verbose, averaging 710 words per responsealmost 2.75 times as many as 3BPrefBERT, which averages 258. The tendency for longer responses is consistent with the reward training curves in Figure 2: 3B-GRM-llama-3B receives higher rewards primarily for increased response length, rather than for high answer quality. While this reward hacking can lead LLM-as-a-judge to assign higher scores, human evaluators often dislike these responses due to their verbosity and lack of conciseness and completeness. Additionally, we observe that 3B-GRM-llama-3B requires 10 more hours of training than other 3B policy models, and 1.5B-GRM-llama-3B takes 7 more hours than other 1.5B models. This increased training time is result of length-based rewards, which guide the model to produce longer responsesthereby increasing the time needed for each GRPO inference and overall training. What distinguishes 3B-PrefBERT from the base model? We further analyze 26 of the examples where 3B-PrefBERT is preferred over the base model. The improvements fall into two main categories: instruction following and tone and fluency.

Repetition rate is the percentage of bigrams that are repeated. Markdown is regular expression that checks whether response follows particular structure and returns boolean  (Table 6) . fails to comply, producing responses that are eiIn contrast, 3Bther too long or overly brief. PrefBERT reliably adheres to such constraints. Additionally, its writing is more polished and humanlike. While the base model tends to sound mechanicalproducing fragmented sentences reminiscent of stitched-together search results3B-PrefBERT generates fluent, cohesive answers. See Appendix Figure 6 and Figure 7 for qualitative examples. 3B-PrefBERT and 3B-GRM-llama-3B frequently use structured outputs. In Table 3, we observe that 3B-PrefBERT and 3B-GRM-llama-3B tend to use markdown formatting more frequently than other models (81.31% and 66.80%, respectively). As result, annotators often note that their outputs have better readability. See qualitative examples in Appendix (Figure 4). 3B-ROUGE-L and 3B-BERTScore tend to be generic and sometimes repetitive. These models often respond to prompts such as Categorize the AI technologies mentioned below: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Robotics with generic definitions (e.g., Machine Learning is subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms...) rather than actually categorizing or differentiating between the terms. Additionally, Table 3 shows that 3B-ROUGE-L can be highly repetitive. In 5.3, we find that ROUGE-L and BERTScore show little reward variance across the training curve, which could indicate that the training signal is too weak, potentially causing the trained models to output vague and surface-level outputs. In contrast, 3B-PrefBERT provides clearer categorizations and contextual explanations for each term, demonstrating stronger content logic. See detailed qualitative analysis in Appendix Figure 5 and Figure 8. 3B-SFT responses are often vague and overly simplified. In annotated examples, 3B-SFT responses explicitly avoid answering the questionsometimes stating dont know or offering no meaningful explanation. For instance, in response to the prompt Why is the Big Bang seen as singular event?, the model deflects the question without addressing the core scientific reasoning. Additionally, on LongForm promptsespecially those derived from Alpaca-style or open-ended datasets3B-SFT tends to produce overly simplified, shallow explanations. These responses often lack both technical depth and structural clarity, which diminishes their informativeness and readability. This trend is also reflected in Table 3, where 3B-SFT produces the shortest responses on average. We attribute this issue in part to the nature of the training data from sources such as ELI5, which contains casual, informal responsesmany of which may be low-quality or factually incorrect. This results in model that mimics the tone and content of noisy or imprecise reference answers. While GRPO-trained models demonstrate better performance over SFT in open-ended long-form generation in our experiments, we do not dismiss SFT as an ineffective approach. When high-quality, human-annotated datasets are available, SFT remains valuable strategyparticularly in domains like code generation (Zhou et al., 2023), where reference outputs are well-defined and reliable."

            "content": "RLVR especially GRPO has been success for its ability to fully leverage LLMs abilities to selfimprove without massive amount of labeled data on many rule-based evaluation tasks. However, extending GRPO study on long-form and openended generation has been underexplored for the challenges of evaluating long-form responses. We propose using small fine-tuned language model (PrefBERT) to evaluates long-form responses with different dimensions and semantic quality evaluation as reward signals for long-form generations of GRPO and show that model trained with PrefBERT generates responses with overall better quality than models trained with traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore or generalized preference reward model, even close to the quality of larger models of the same backbone. Our work shows the potential of applying more efficient and robust verifiable reward design into the GRPO pipeline for models to self-improve its long-form and openended generations beyond using traditional reward metrics. Future work can expand upon current work on more diverse open-ended generation tasks such as training more efficient and stronger verifiable reward models and apply them on creative writings, creative research and design, or openended math problems."

Larger evaluators, while potentially offering more reliable and semantically accurate rewards, significantly increase GPU memory usage and slow down training. We hypothesize that incorporating stronger evaluator to provide high-quality, verifiable rewards could unlock the full potential of GRPO for aligning LLMs on open-ended tasks."
