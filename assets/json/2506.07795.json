Introduction Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge memorization and reasoning capabilities through large-scale pretraining [1], [2]. However, this progress has also exacerbated concerns regarding the potential misuse of these models knowledge and capabilities by malicious actors, potentially leading to harm or privacy leakage [3]. The broad data sources from the entire internet used for training, coupled with the inherent black-box nature of model parameters, make precise control over harmful and sensitive information within LLMs extremely challenging. promising direction to address this critical issue is LLM unlearning [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], which aims to remove or suppress unwanted knowledge in the model. LLM Unlearning shows promise in directly mitigating dangerous information and offering more fundamental approach to guaranteeing model safety [5], [9], [10], which has become core focus in current research. Recent research has introduced various unlearning methods. To achieve the goal of approximately erasing or suppressing information, the core ideas of existing methods can be categorized into two paradigms. (1) Disrupting Task Alignment methods adjust the models task alignment concerning target unlearning knowledge, typically through to deflect model question-answering (QA) pair formats, responses towards specific refusal answers. Representative approaches include Rejection Tuning (RT) [11] and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [12]. (2) Suppressing Sequence Probability methods directly train on unstructured text sequences involving target knowledge, aiming to reduce the models overall probability of generating such sequences, thereby encouraging knowledge unlearning. This is typically achieved through techniques like Gradient Ascent (GA) [13] and Negative Preference Optimization (NPO) [14]. While these methods have indeed demonstrated some potential, recent studies also indicate that they often lack robustness in practical downstream application scenarios and can exhibit failures across various task settings [15], [16], thereby questioning their practical deployability [17]. Consequently, understanding the capabilities and limitations of these methods, identifying potential problems and subsequently address them, has become increasingly crucial. In this study, we observe that many instances where unlearning fails in downstream tasks can be attributed to common problem: the effectiveness of existing unlearning methods is highly dependent on the form of the training samples and often fails to generalize to alternate experssions of the same knowledge. In natural language, piece of knowledge can often be expressed in numerous forms: the fact Stephen King was born in year 1947 can Figure 1. Illustrations of the two dominant paradigms of unlearning methods (left), and examples of Form-Dependent Bias issue (right). appear as declarative sentence, QA pair, or various paraphrased forms. However, current unlearning methods are often trained using only one such format. We observe that model trained with QA pairs might forget the answer to When was Stephen King born?, yet still succeed in answering the equivalent question framed as fill-in-theblank or multiple-choice problem. This fragility significantly impacts safety in downstream applications, particularly in adversarial scenarios where malicious actors can attempt an infinite variety of task forms. Furthermore, existing benchmarks typically evaluate unlearning effectiveness only on limited number of formats and overlook this crucial robustness issue [15]. We formally define this problem as Form-Dependent Bias and identify two key failure patterns through preliminary experiments (3): (1) Cross-Task Transfer Failure, arises when methods erase knowledge in trained task formats like QA but fail to generalize to untrained ones like fill-in-the-blank (FB). This is particularly severe for task-alignment methods like RT&DPO, which condition safety behaviors on specific format cues. (2) Unseen Token Generalization Failure reveals deeper limitation: even sequence suppression methods that generalize well on conventional tasks struggle when answers involve tokens unseen during unlearning. For instance, while training may suppress direct generation of [1947] in Stephen Kingrelated contexts, preventing its output across QA and FB tasks, the model can still output [A] (the label for 1947 in multiple-choice questions) because label tokens like [A] were never explicitly suppressed. This indicates that current methods often operate at the token/sequence level rather than erasing conceptual knowledge, allowing adversarial queries to bypass unlearning through token substitutions or indirect references. To systematically investigate this issue, we construct new fine-grained Benchmark for Out-ofDistribution Robustness Test (ORT) (4) to further investigate its prevalence and support future research on LLM safety. ORT includes four different task formats on both the forget and retain sets, specially designed to expose these two patterns, thereby comprehensively testing forgetting robustness across various forms. Comprehensive experiments on Llama3-8B-Instruct [18] and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 demonstrate that Form-Dependent Bias is widespread and very significant across existing unlearning methods. We argue that LLM Unlearning should be formindependent, as the adversarial nature of safety scenarios demands that unlearning must generalize effectively across all potential downstream task formats where the knowledge might be queried. To further mitigate this issue, we propose that potential solution is to unlearn the invariants across downstream task forms: although the possible task forms might be infinite, the core concept targeted for forgetting remains consistent, which suggests that it might be possible to achieve form-independent unlearning by manipulating the models internal conceptual activation. Building upon this insight, we propose our novel method: Rank-One Concept Redirection (ROCR), training-free parameter modification technique capable of adjusting the models concept representation mapping in seconds (5). ROCR works by redirecting target dangerous concept for forgetting to an alternative, safe concept. For instance, redirecting the concept Stephen King to Donald Trump fundamentally inhibits the recall of Stephen King-related knowledge, as the model will respond using knowledge associated with Trump instead of correctly recognizing Stephen King. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROCR significantly outperforms mainstream unlearning paradigms in terms of both unlearning effectiveness and preserving unrelated knowledge (6), while exhibiting strong transferability across downstream tasks, providing highly natural responses comparable to the models native knowledge. We summarize our contributions as follows: We characterize and analyze prevalent issue in existing unlearning methods: their inability to generalize forgetting to knowledge forms beyond those seen in the unlearning samples. We term this limitation FormDependent Bias. We design new benchmark ORT to systematically evaluate Form-Dependent Bias in unlearning methods, paving the way for future in-depth research on this issue. We advocate that LLM unlearning should be formindependent, and propose novel unlearning method, ROCR, as an exploratory practice along this path. ROCR demonstrates the ability to naturally generalize forgetting across downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments validate the superior effectiveness of our method. 2. Background & Preliminaries This section provides definitions of key concepts and necessary technical backgrounds relevant to our work. 2.1. Large Language Models Model Architecture. We focus on mainstream autoregressive language models, such as the GPT [1] and Llama [18] series, which are predominantly based on the Transformer architecture [19]. text Tokenization and Prediction. An input is first processed by tokenizer, segmenting it into sequence of tokens, which serve as fundamental computational units for the model. While in many cases single word maps to single token, tokenization can also produce subword units. Given an input token sequence = [x1, x2, . . . , xt], the model estimates the conditional probability distribution (xt+1 x1, x2, . . . , xt) to generate the next token. These tokens are embedded as hidden states within the LLM and are iteratively updated across Transformer layers. Subtokens. single word can be decomposed into multiple subtokens (e.g., [tokens] vs. [to,k,ens]), and LLM process these distinct representations as entirely different vectors, leading to different behavior. We define subtoken as an individual token within such finergrained sequence, where sequence of such subtokens collectively represents the same semantic content as single, larger token. Transformer Layer Update. Each Transformer layer comprises two primary components [20]: self-attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The hidden state hl the previous layer as follows: at position in layer is computed from 1 = hl1 hl + al = attnl (cid:0)hl1 al = Wl ml + ml , hl1 2 fc(al denotes the output of the self-attention subi is the output of the MLP sub-layer. The fc and Wl proj are learnable parameters, and where al layer, and ml matrices Wl σ represents non-linear activation function. (cid:1) , . . . , hl1 )(cid:1) , + hl1 proj σ (cid:0)Wl (1) 2.2. LLM Unlearning Definition. LLM unlearning aims to modify the parameters of large language model to eliminate or suppress specific knowledge or behaviors [21]. The objective is to ensure that the updated model no longer exhibit or retain any information associated with specific forget set Df , while maintaining knowledge about retain set Dr [22]. Threat Model. We consider the following black box threat model, which assumes two parties: target LLM F. It allows users to query it and receive responses, but prohibits access to its internal parameters, simulating the scenario of closed-source LLMs like GPT. We assume the model developer has applied an unlearning method to erase knowledge from specific forget set Df . An adversary. The adversarys goal is to extract knowledge contained in Df through model outputs. Similar to existing unlearning work [15], [23], we consider very weak case where they only use simple natural language queries but can be in various formats, excluding stronger adversarial strategies such as using optimizers or performing any prompt perturbations, which is closer to typical user interaction. Our study reveals that unlearning methods struggle to guarantee security even under this weak threat model. 3. The Form-Dependent Bias Issue Under the current unlearning paradigm, LLMs are typically trained to forget knowledge presented in single specific representation form [11], [23]. However, this often results in only superficial forgetting: while the targeted form is erased, semantically equivalent knowledge expressed in alternative forms remains largely intact. We refer to this vulnerability as Form-Dependent Bias, phenomenon with significant implications for the security and reliability of unlearned LLMs. To empirically validate this issue, we conduct preliminary experiment to illustrate the aforementioned problem. We first detail the experimental setup, including the baseline models and the fine-grained metrics (3.1). We then elaborate on how Form-Dependent Bias manifests in downstream tasks based on experimental results (3.2), categorizing its patterns into two types: Cross-Task Transfer Failure and Unseen Token Generalization Failure. 3.1. Preliminary Experiments Settings We first evaluate the robustness of unlearned LLMs across various assessment tasks based on the pipeline provided by RWKU [11], extending it with novel evaluation tasks and more fine-grained test metrics. RWKU offers real-world unlearning test environment where the unlearning targets consist of 200 well-known real-world individuals. This knowledge is native to the models training data and is not influenced by factors such as safety alignment, thereby providing test environment closely mimicking real-world application scenarios. Evaluation Tasks. We introduce three tasks to investigate the models generalization capabilities across different task formats: Simple QA, Fill-in-the-Blank (FB), and Multiple Choice Problems (MCP). Details and examples for these tasks can be found in Figure 3. Notably, QA tasks are the closest to the training sample format of paradigms like RT and DPO, while MCP is the furthest. Additionally, for QA and FB tasks, the model was required to output actual answer tokens seen in the training corpus; while MCP required the model to implicitly map its knowledge to output corresponding labels (e.g., A, for choices), which did not appear in the training corpus. Metrics. Referencing existing unlearning work [23], we select more fine-grained, continuous probability-based metrics for detailed assessment of the unlearning performance. For given question prompt in the test set, we examine the joint probability of the tokens corresponding to the models answer: P(answer prompt). Baselines. We focus on four representative baselines from two classes of unlearning paradigms: disrupting task alignment and reducing sequence probability. Within the first class of paradigms, we analyze two baselines: Rejection Tuning (RT) finetunes the model on QA pairs to increase the output probability of refusal responses (e.g., dont know). This encourages the model to choose to refuse to answer when encountering questions related to the forget target. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) uses DPO to adjust model alignment, which typically requires positive sample and negative sample. Here, the positive sample is refusal response similar to RT, while the negative sample is the models original response that contains the knowledge to be forgotten. This encourages the model to increase the probability of the refusal response while suppressing the probability of responses related to the target knowledge. Both of the above baselines operate in the format of QA tasks. In contrast, the second paradigm typically operates on unstructured text in pre-training style, suppressing the joint probability of token sequences related to the target knowledge. We selected the following two baselines: Gradient Ascent (GA) is applied to unstructured text, utilizing next token prediction loss analogous to that used in pre-training. In contrast to pre-trainings gradient descent on the training corpus, GA maximizes the negative log-likelihood on the forget set, causing the model to deviate from its original predictions on these data. Negative Preference Optimization (NPO) is an extension based on DPO, which uses the forget set as negative samples and does not require positive samples. It similarly encourages the model to reduce the probability of the forget set and deviate from original predictions. Compared to GA, it is bounded optimization, which is generally more stable. 3.2. The Characteristics of Form-Dependent Bias An ideally unlearned model should exhibit forgetfulness when queried about target knowledge, either by refusing to answer or by providing irrelevant content. In both scenarios, the probability of generating the correct answer should be significantly reduced, and ideally, this reduction should be substantial and consistent across all tasks or forms. However, in the presence of Form-Dependent Bias, an empirically observable phenomenon that the degree of probability reduction varies significantly across different forms. The results from our preliminary experiments, as shown in Figure 2, confirm this phenomenon. We summarize the manifestation of Form-Dependent Bias in practice into two distinct patterns: Pattern 1: Cross-Task Transfer Failure. This pattern is characterized by the marked degradation in methods effectiveness as the downstream task format deviates from the unlearning training format, with greater deviation leading to more significant degradation. As illustrated in Figure 2, RT achieved 58.12% probability reduction on QA tasks, which closely resemble its training format, relative to the unlearned model. However, its effectiveness significantly diminished on FB tasks, yielding only 34.03% reduction. Furthermore, on MCP tasks, which represent the greatest deviation from the training task format, the reduction was mere 5%, rendering the unlearning almost ineffective. This identical issue is equally evident with DPO, which operates under the same paradigm, indicating that this pattern profoundly impacts methods designed to disrupt task alignment. Pattern 2: Unseen Token Generalization Failure. This pattern is characterized by the inability of unlearning methods to generalize the forgetting effect when the answers involve tokens unseen during unlearning, even if these tokens express the same content as the forgetting corpus. While primarily targeting the paradigm of suppressing sequence probability, this pattern affects both major unlearning paradigms. In our pre-experiment, while MCP and FB involved identical knowledge, the sole difference was that FB required the model to directly output the answer itself tokens in the training set whose probabilities were suppressed. MCP, conversely, required the model to output labels and implicitly invoke the knowledge, with the training set not involving the suppression of these labels probabilities. As shown in Figure 2, although GA demonstrated 48.95% Figure 2. Preliminary Experimental Results for Different Unlearning Methods probability reduction on FB tasks, its effectiveness significantly diminished on MCP tasks, achieving only 20.03% probability reduction. NPO, which shares GAs paradigm, exhibited similar performance drop on MCP tasks. This indicates that methods face challenges with unseen token generalization, and further suggests they may merely overfit to reducing the probability of surface-level tokens rather than truly removing the underlying knowledge. Conclusion. Our preceding analysis demonstrated the existence of Form-dependent Bias in practical scenarios and analyzed its specific manifestations. We emphasize that Form-dependent Bias poses tangible threat to practical security scenarios. If the models erasure effectiveness is so heavily dependent on the training format/task that it fails to generalize to the relatively simple downstream tasks we tested, it will clearly be more challenging for it to handle practical security scenarios, where malicious attackers can explore an unbounded task space. This highlights the need for deeper analysis of Form-dependent Biass characteristics and mitigation strategies. 4. Further Analysis on Form-Dependent Bias To systematically investigate the prevalence and severity of Form-Dependent Bias in existing unlearning paradigms and facilitate future research, we introduce Benchmark for Out-of-Distribution Robustness Testing (ORT). ORT enables comprehensive assessment of unlearning effectiveness across diverse downstream task formats, incorporating evaluation metrics for both Forget Set and Retain Set. This framework allows rigorous examination of generalization limitations in current unlearning methods while quantifying their knowledge retention trade-offs. 4.1. The ORT Benchmark ORT employs 200 real-world prominent individuals as unlearning targets. Each unlearning target is associated with three training corpus formats adapted for different unlearning methods and eight evaluation tasks across the Forget Set and Retain Set. These tasks cover four unique formats, Figure 3. Example of unlearning training corpus and evaluation task formats in the ORT Benchmark, with answers marked in []. including two base tasks: Simple-QA (QA) and Fill-in-theBlank (FB), and two tasks specifically designed to induce unseen token generalization failure: Multiple Choice Problems (MCP) and Subtoken-inducing QA (SQA). We employ probability-based metrics (3.1) for these tasks. Examples of the unlearning training corpus and evaluation task formats are shown in Figure 3. Taking Stephen King as an unlearning example, we first introduce two fundamental task formats: Simple-QA (QA) employs the most straightforward question structure to query knowledge related to the target. For the example shown in the figure, in wellunlearned model, the prediction probability for the correct answer [author] should be significantly low. Fill-in-the-Blank (FB) uses fill-in-the-blank style question, requiring the model to complete the missing content based on its knowledge. We specifically designed two tasks to induce the model to generate tokens not present in the training corpus, thereby evaluating the models robustness against unseen token generalization failure: Multiple Choice Problems (MCP): This format queries the models knowledge using multiple-choice questions. It requires the model to implicitly access knowledge and output chosen label rather than the exact answer tokens seen in the training corpus. This evaluates the unlearning methods ability to generalize to unseen tokens and verifies whether the knowledge is truly forgotten. Subtoken-inducing QA (SQA): SQA also poses QA questions, but requires the model to output character by character. Although the concatenated characters form the same content as regular answer, the LLMs tokenization mechanism causes the model to output subtokens (2.1) here, not the exact tokens from the training corpus. These subtokens have different representations within the model, enabling more directly test of whether unlearning affects only the exact tokens or the knowledge itself. We emphasize that the knowledge queried by MCP is consistent with FB, and the knowledge queried by SQA is consistent with QA, with the only difference being the format. This allows for more direct analysis of the FormDependent Bias issue in unlearning models. We deployed these four tasks on both the forget set and the retain set, allowing us to analyze the differences in the trade-off between target knowledge forgetting vs. unrelated knowledge retention across different tasks. 4.2. Utility Evaluation To complement our primary evaluation and comprehensively assess the impact of unlearning on the general utility of LLMs, we incorporate several established benchmarks. These benchmarks serve to quantify the extent to which unlearning affects the models broader, general-purpose capabilities. We selected four widely-adopted benchmarks and report their respective, commonly used metrics: MMLU [24] consists of multiple-choice questions covering diverse range of general knowledge domains. It is employed to assess the potential degradation of the models performance on broader, unrelated knowledge areas due to unlearning, thereby gauging any unintended catastrophic forgetting. We report 5-shot accuracy. TruthfulQA [25] is utilized to evaluate the truthfulness of the language models generated responses. This allows us to examine whether the unlearning process inadvertently diminishes the models reliability or increases its propensity to generate non-factual statements. We report 6-shot accuracy on its MC1 (multiple-choice, single correct answer) task. TriviaQA [26] is reading comprehension dataset, containing QA pairs that necessitate significant document understanding. It is used to evaluate alterations in the unlearned models proficiency in text comprehension and information extraction. We report the 6-shot F1 Score. AlpacaEval [27] assesses the models generative quality, specifically evaluating whether the unlearning method impairs its generation fluency and coherence. We report the average of bi-gram and tri-gram entropies. 4.3. Results & Findings We conducted unlearning experiments using GA, NPO, RT, and DPO on two contemporary LLMs: Llama3-8BInstruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and report the performance of both the base and unlearned models on each task across the forget and retain sets, as detailed in Table 1. Additionally, we provide the performance on four general utility benchmarks as supplementary analysis in Figure 4. Based on these results, our key findings are summarized as follows: Finding 1: Severe Form-Dependent Bias is prevalent in existing unlearning methods. As depicted in Table 1, the efficacy of all evaluated unlearning methods in achieving desired forgetting on downstream tasks exhibits profound dependence on the task format. This is unequivocally reflected in the substantial disparities observed in metrics across different task formats. Taking the Llama3 forget set as an example, GA can reduce the probability by nearly 50% on the best-performing FB task, but only by limited 14.62% on the subtoken QA task. Similarly, RT reduced the correct answer probability by 58.12% on the QA task, yet only by 5.67% on the MCP task. Various methods applied to the Mistral model also demonstrated similar cross-task metric discrepancies, which underscores the pervasive nature of this phenomenon across different model architectures. Finding 2: Methods based on Disrupting Task Alignment exhibit more pronounced cross-task transfer failure. Our results on the ORT dataset are consistent with those from preliminary experiments: RT and DPO generally perform better on QA tasks, which closely resemble their training sample format, and worst on MCP tasks, which are most dissimilar to their training data. comparison with the Retain Set reveals that methods like RT, while achieving unlearning, also significantly perturb the probabilities for QA and similar tasks on the retain set. Our observations of the models actual outputs indicate that it sometimes refuses knowledge unrelated to the forgetting targets. This potentially suggests that these paradigms might overfit to the task format for refusal rather than precisely identifying and rejecting specific knowledge. In contrast, GA and NPO perform stably on the two fundamental tasks, QA and FB, which could be attributed to their training on unstructured text without relying on specific task format. Interestingly, the performance of RT and DPO on the Utility datasets corroborates these findings: both methods show little impact on model capabilities on MMLU and TruthfulQA (both MCP-formatted benchmarks), but their performance significantly declines on TriviaQA, which is free QA-formatted benchmark. Finding 3: Methods based on Suppressing Sequence Probability primarily exhibit unseen token generalizaTABLE 1.

Utility evaluation results of different unlearning methods. tion failure. Methods such as GA and NPO are trained directly on task-agnostic text. While this approach mitiit nevertheless gates overfitting to specific task formats, exhibits significant difficulty in generalizing to unseen, outof-distribution tokens. Specifically, GA and NPO demonstrate strong performance on the conventional QA and FB tasks within the Forget Set, effectively erasing the targeted knowledge. However, their efficacy markedly declines on MCP and the more direct SQA, both of which necessitate answering with unseen tokens. For instance, on Llama3, GA achieves 42.47% reduction in answer probability on standard QA tasks relative to the original model, yet only 14.62% reduction on SQA, despite querying the identical knowledge. While GA and NPO appear to significantly reduce SQA probabilities on the Mistral model, critical comparison with the Retain Set reveals substantial degradation of capabilities on the retain set, approaching the performance observed on the forget set. This indicates that their apparent forgetting effect is largely attributable to general degradation of the models overall capabilities, which deviates from the objective of unlearning and renders the result less meaningful. Furthermore, MCP performance on Mistral was notably poor. These suggests that such paradigms may encourage models to adopt shortcuts, merely forgetting superficial associations between tokens encountered during training. Consequently, the model might still implicitly recall knowledge when prompted with outof-distribution tokens, posing potential vulnerability for exploitation by malicious actors. 5. Rank-One Concept Redirection We argue that effective LLM Unlearning should be formindependent to ensure robustness across diverse downstream tasks, particularly in security-critical scenarios. However, existing paradigms exhibit strong form-dependent bias. potential solution we propose is to unlearn the invariants across downstream task forms: although the possible task Figure 5. Overview of our proposed ROCR Framework. ROCR leverages rank-one MLP updates to redirect specific concepts to desired, safer ones, thereby suppressing associated knowledge recall. forms might be infinite, the core concept targeted for forgetting remains consistent. If method could modify internal representation mappings to prevent the model from recognizing this concept, it could fundamentally suppress knowledge recall pertaining to the unlearning target. Building upon this insight, we propose Rank-One Concept Redirection (ROCR) as an exploratory practice along this path. As depicted in Figure 5, ROCR is training-free parameter update strategy that performs rank-one update on the MLP sublayers of the model. This modification redirects the internal representation of the unlearning target to that of another semantic concept. For instance, by redirecting the concept of Stephen King to Donald Trump, the models internal inference process, when queried about Stephen King, is channeled to retrieve knowledge associated with Donald Trump; thereby suppresses the recall of original information pertaining to King. In this section, we first introduce interpretability findings that provide the theoretical basis for ROCR, followed by detailed description of our methods implementation. 5.1. Background and Rationale ROCR achieves concept redirection by redirecting specific hidden states, building upon recent research that investigates knowledge recall mechanisms in LLMs [20], [28]. These works reveal that attention mechanisms aggregate subject-related information from input into the hidden state corresponding to the final token of the subject span [28], denoted as hs. This hidden state is subsequently enriched by MLP modules through the injection of subject-specific attribute information. As result, the shallow-layer hidden state hs encodes substantial information about the subject, serving as crucial internal representation of specific semantic entities (concepts). This representation is leveraged by the model for subsequent predictions and reasoning tasks [20], [29], [30], [31]. ROCR performs hidden state redirection by updating parameters within the MLP sublayers, drawing inspiration from insights into Transformer architectures and advances in model editing [20], [32], [33]. In Transformer layers, previous research [34] has characterized attention as token-mixers that blend information across token positions, while MLPs act as channel-mixers responsible for feature extraction. Further studies have identified that the postactivation outputs of MLPs first layer as feature-specific keys [28], [35]. Building on these findings, ROCR modifies the second-layer parameters of the MLP to enable precise unlearning of target concepts: when activation patterns corresponding to forgotten concepts emerge, the updated parameters redirect hidden states toward specified targets. 5.2. Methodology In this section, we present the implementation details of our method. As shown in Figure 5, our method involves redirecting specific concept representations to target representations, achieved through rank-one update to MLP layer. Simply put, ROCR modifies the down projection matrix of an MLP layer to achieve the following functionalities: (1) If the representation hf , associated with the target concept to be forgotten, is activated as kf , its output is projected onto specific redirection vector vr, which subsequently redirects the models hidden state to specific target concept ht. (2) For all other cases, the MLP output remains unchanged, ensuring minimal interference with unrelated model behavior. To achieve this, our method is structured into three steps: Step 1: Collect the Characteristic Activation kf for the Forget Target Concept. Following prior LLM interpretability studies, we begin by identifying the characteristic MLP activation associated with the concept to be forgotten. Specifically, we construct set of input sentences {sj}N j=1, each containing the forget target word wf , and extract the activation of the final token of wf at designated MLP layer l. Formally, for each sentence sj, the activation is computed as: act(s) = σ (cid:16) W(l) fc (cid:16) s[wf ] + h(l1) a(l) s[wf ] (cid:17)(cid:17) , kf = 1 (cid:88) j=1 act(sj). This projection matrix can project perturbations to the 0 . Based on this, the final model into the null space of K0K parameter update objective can be formulated as: (2) = arg min (cid:18)(cid:13) (cid:13)(W + P)kf vr (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) + (cid:19) . (7) Here, σ() denotes the activation function, W(l) fc is the layerl up-projection matrix of the MLP, a(l) sj [wf ] is the attention output, and h(l1) s[wf ] is the residual hidden state input. In our implementation, we use = 5 chat-templated sentences to generate the inputs {sj}N j=1, ensuring the extracted activations reflect realistic usage scenarios. Step 2: Compute the Redirection Vector vr. This step first requires determining the representation ht of the target concept. Subsequently, vr is computed to redirect the models conceptual representation of the unlearning target. Similar to Step 1, we collect the average target concept representation ht by passing multiple sentences containing the redirection target word wt. The key distinction here is that the collected objects are the LLMs hidden states, rather than activations. Formally, we have: For convenience of expression, let = vr vf denote the desired change in output v. The closed-form solution for this update objective can be solved very quickly: = Rk (cid:0)kf P + I(cid:1)1 . (8) The final updated MLP down-projection matrix is given by ˆW = + . Crucially, the only computationally intensive part in the entire ROCR process is the initial acquisition of K0, which in practice is estimated using 100,000 Wikipedia data entries. However, this calculation only needs to be performed once per model, after which it can be saved and directly invoked during unlearning. single redirection operation thus only requires two forward passes and some matrix computations, entirely without backpropagation, allowing it to complete within seconds. 6. Evaluations on ROCR ht = 1 (cid:88) j=1 h(l) sj [wt]. (3) In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to address the following research questions: Given the original MLP output vf corresponding to the forget target, the redirection vector vr is defined as: vr = vf + (ht hf ), (4) which intuitively shifts the output from the original forget target representation hf toward the redirection target ht Step 3: Null-space Constrained Parameter Update. To achieve unlearning, the new parameters must correctly map kf to vr while preserving existing mappings for other inputs to minimize disruption to unrelated knowledge (the retain set). Let K0 = [k0, k1, . . . , km] denote set of activation vectors whose outputs should remain unchanged, and let V0 = [v0, v1, . . . , vm] be their corresponding original MLP outputs. The parameter update objective is formalized as: (cid:18)(cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) ˆWkf vr (cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) + (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) ˆWK0 V0 2(cid:19) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) . (5) arg min ˆW This objective aligns with recent advances in model editing [20], [29], [36], [37], where closed-form solutions have been proposed for editing MLPs [20]. Following these practices, we project the parameter update onto the null space of K0 (K0) to prevent interference with irrelevant knowledge. The projection matrix is computed using SVD [37]: = UnullU null, (6) where {U, Λ, U} = SVD(K0K 0 ), and Unull consists of the columns of corresponding to zero singular values, spanning the null space of K0K 0 . RQ1: How does ROCRs performance in executing unlearning tasks compare to existing unlearning methods? Specifically, can it effectively mitigate the problem of Form-dependent Bias? RQ2: What is the computational efficiency of ROCR compared to traditional unlearning methods? Does the redirection process introduce significant computational overhead? RQ3: What is the practical output quality of models subjected to ROCR in real-world scenarios? Can ROCR ensure models produce natural and generalized outputs, rather than overfitting to the unlearning objective? RQ4: Does the specific type of concept entity to which ROCR redirects the forgotten concept impact the overall unlearning effectiveness? If so, which types of redirection targets demonstrate the best performance? RQ5: ROCRs mechanism involves redirecting forgotten concepts to alternative semantic entities. Can this redirection be extended to non-semantic entities, such as Gaussian noise? If so, would such an approach yield superior unlearning efficacy? RQ6: How sensitive is ROCRs performance to its hyperparameter configuration? Does ROCR necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning, and what is the impact of hyperparameter settings on its efficacy? 6.1. Unlearning and Retention Performance (RQ1) The results from our main experiments demonstrate ROCRs performance on both the unlearning and retention Figure 6. Average running time of various unlearning methods on Llama38B-Instruct. sets on ORT, alongside its overall model utility. Comparing against other unlearning methods, we summarize our key observations as follows: Obs 1: ROCR consistently achieves superior unlearning performance across nearly all metrics and base models. As illustrated in Table 1, ROCR continuously outperforms traditional unlearning methods, reaching optimal performance on the majority of metrics. It significantly reduces the models probability of answering forgotten target knowledge on the unlearning set. Furthermore, ROCR demonstrates remarkable robustness against Form-Dependent Bias, performing exceptionally well on traditional tasks; even on more challenging tasks like MCP and Subtoken QA, ROCR surpasses traditional methods, showcasing stronger generalization capabilities to unseen tokens, which highlights the promising nature of this approach. Obs 2: ROCR demonstrates exceptional retention of irrelevant knowledge, significantly outperforming other baselines. On the Retain Set, ROCR exhibits excellent preservation of irrelevant knowledge, causing minimal perturbation to the model across most metrics. The maximum relative negative perturbation introduced by ROCR across different task formats is 7.82%. It is the only method among all evaluated that keeps negative perturbations below 10% across all metrics, indicating uniform and minor impact across various task formats. In our evaluations of the unlearned models general utility, as shown in Figure 4, ROCR consistently yields metrics closest to the original base model across all datasets, resulting in minimal impact on the models general capabilities. Furthermore, on the AlpacaEval dataset, ROCR achieves the highest scores, showing virtually no difference from the original model, which demonstrates that models unlearned with ROCR are capable of producing highly fluent and natural outputs. 6.2. Computational Efficiency and Runtime (RQ2) Another crucial metric determining the practicality of an unlearning method is its computational complexity. To analyze ROCRs computational efficiency compared to other baselines, we conducted experiments using an NVIDIA Figure 7. Llama3-8B-Instruct generation examples of unlearning baselines and ROCR. Tesla A100 (80G) GPU and compared the average time required to complete single unlearning task. The results are presented in Figure 6. Based on these, we have the following observation: Obs3: As training-free method, ROCR demonstrates computational efficiency far superior to all baselines. As shown in Figure 6, traditional methods often require training on forget corpus, which incurs significant time overhead. The most complex methods, DPO and NPO, further reduce efficiency by necessitating the simultaneous creation of reference model during training, with DPO taking up to 40 minutes to complete single training run. RT is slightly faster due to its training data consisting of short QA pairs with fewer tokens, but it still operates on the order of minutes. In contrast, ROCR completes single unlearning task in just 21 seconds. This remarkable speed is attributed to its design, which only requires two forward passes to extract representations of the forgotten target concept and the redirection target concept. Subsequent parameter updates are achieved through simple matrix operations, without needing any backpropagation. This gives ROCR clear computational complexity advantage and highly promising prospects. It is also important to emphasize that this experiment only compares the time required for the actual optimization process, which is somewhat unfair to ROCR, as the construction of the forget corpus for traditional methods is itself considerably complex procedure. 6.3. Practical Output Quality (RQ3) To examine how the unlearned models respond to questions in practical scenarios, we selected the unlearning target Stephen King, the first set in the ORT benchmark, and extracted several QA and FB questions for case study. The results are presented in Figure 7. When applying ROCR, we chose to redirect this target concept to Donald Trump, expecting the model, when queried about Stephen King, to interpret the concept as Donald Trump and exclusively utilize Trump-related knowledge for its response, thereby preventing the recall of information pertaining to the forgotten target. We summarize this experiment with the following observation: Obs 4: ROCR produces outputs of exceptional naturalness by seamlessly aligning the models understanding of the forgotten concept with the redirected target. As shown in Figure 7, all baseline methods exhibited issues to varying degrees on both tasks, often outputting correct answers that were intended for unlearning. Furthermore, NPO even suffered model collapse on the FB task, failing to produce any meaningful tokens. In contrast, the model unlearned with ROCR actively recalled and adapted information associated with the redirected target, without revealing any information about the forgotten target, demonstrating effective suppression of the target knowledge. Notably, ROCRs transferability extends to creative associations: e.g., Stephen Kings title King of Horror is innovatively reinterpreted as King of Real Estates for Trump. It is important to emphasize that this new title is evidently not common or pre-existing association but rather creative generation by the model itself. This behavior indicates that ROCR achieves deeper form of conceptual manipulation, highlighting its promising potential as paradigm for controlled knowledge manipulation. 6.4. Effect of Redirection Semantics (RQ4) ROCR achieves unlearning by redirecting the target concept to another semantic entity. This section investigates how different choices of redirection targets influence the effectiveness of unlearning. 6.4.1. Experimental Setup. We divide the experiments into two categories based on the semantic class of the redirection target: same-class entities and different-class entities. Redirection to Same-Class Concepts. The unlearning targets in ORT are well-known real-world figures. Therefore, this experiment focused on evaluating the effect of redirecting to different persons. We primarily selected four entities with varying levels of popularity, determined by their Wikipedia page views (i.e., whether their Wikipedia page is popular). Specifically, these entities are Donald Trump, Tim Cook, Haruki Murakami, and relatively obscure figure, Augustin Chaho. Donald Trump ranks first in Wikipedias popular figures and is associated with extensive knowledge within models; conversely, the most obscure figure, Chaho, is expected to have very limited knowledge in LLMs. Redirection to Different-Class Concepts. In this experiment, we selected two distinct types of concepts as rediFigure 8. Performance of ROCR redirecting to different targets on the ORT Benchmark, the dashed line indicates the performance of the original model prior to unlearning. rection targets: Minecraft and Avocado. These served as supplementary experiments to observe ROCRs performance during redirection. 6.4.2. Experimental Results. We conducted experiments on the ORT benchmark based on the aforementioned setup, with results presented in Figure 8. Additionally, to specifically illustrate the models actual behavior after ROCR redirection, we also provide the models real outputs and selected several creative questions to examine its generalization capabilities. Our observations are as follows: Obs 5: ROCR maintains robust fundamental performance when redirecting to various concept entities; same-class and more popular concept entities generally perform slightly better. As seen in Figure 8, the forgetting performance for same-class person concepts is almost strictly ordered by popularity, with higher popularity correlating with better efficacy. This might be attributed to the greater abundance of knowledge associated with highly popular concepts within the model, allowing their recall to more strongly overwrite that of the original forget target. Performance with different types of concept entities is marginally worse, although the highly popular Minecraft entity still demonstrates good results. Overall, selecting target entity does not appear to be significant challenge, as one merely needs to choose popular, same-class concept entity. Another characteristic of ROCR is its powerful downstream task generalization capability. Here, we provide case studies for redirection to different entities to further demonstrate this feature and analyze the specific behavior of LLM responses. The generation examples in Figure 9 are all derived from the models real output, with the random seed fixed at 42. We summarize our findings as the following observation: Obs 6: ROCR facilitates natural generalization by effectively incorporating the attributes of the target concept when redirected to different concepts. As illustrated in Figure 9, the redirected model demonstrates Figure 10. Performance of ROCR and its two variants on the ORT Benchmark, the dashed line indicates the performance of the original model prior to unlearning. of the target representation ht, which determines the redirection destination of the forgotten concept. Redirecting to Gaussian Noise. ROCR-noise aims to project specific concepts onto Gaussian noise, thereby disrupting the models ability to recall knowledge associated with them. Intuitively, we define ht as follows: ht = hs z, where Rd and (0, I). (9) The subsequent weight update procedure follows the original ROCR. Redirecting to Rejection Response Vector. ROCR-reject is designed to enable the model to immediately refuse to answer when queried about the forgotten concept. To achieve this, we optimize perturbation δ such that the redirected representation ht = hs + δ maximizes the likelihood of rejection response. The optimization objective is defined as: argmin δ 1 (cid:88) piP log PF (hs+δi) [Reject pi] , (10) where is set of prompts related to the forgotten concept, and F(hs + δ) denotes the models output distribution when the representation is steered to hs + δ. Once the optimal ht is obtained, it is used in the standard ROCR framework to compute parameter updates. 6.5.2. Experimental Results. We ran the two ROCR variants on the ORT benchmark, and their results are shown in Figure 10. From the experimental results, we summarize the following observations: Obs 7: ROCR and its variants all achieve excellent unlearning performance, with the original ROCR showing more stable performance. Results in the Figure demonstrate that several ROCR variants consistently perform unlearning, significantly reducing the probability of answers from the Forget Set and minimizing probabilistic perturbations to knowledge in the Retain Set. Among them, ROCR-rejects performance on specific tasks even surpasses that of standard ROCR, Figure 9. Llama3-8B-Instruct generation examples under ROCR redirection to different targets. an explicit effort to utilize the knowledge associated with the redirection target to answer questions. After simple redirection within the same category, the LLM can answer very naturally. Even after redirection to different-class concepts, the LLMs responses consistently incorporate the attributes of the redirection target concept and do not leak information about the forgotten target entity, showcasing ROCRs strong robustness and safety. 6.5. Non-Semantic Redirection Targets (RQ5) As previously discussed, ROCR typically achieves unlearning by redirecting the representation of the forgotten concept to another semantic entity, as extracted from the models internal representations. However, achieving the goal of unlearning may not inherently require redirection to semantically meaningful concept. Instead, redirecting to non-semantic or even randomly generated vectors may suffice to suppress the models ability to recall the forgotten knowledge. To explore this possibility, we designed two ROCR variants: ROCR-noise and ROCR-reject. ROCRnoise redirects the target concept representation to random Gaussian noise vector, while ROCR-reject projects it onto learned vector specifically optimized to induce rejection responses. In this section, we conduct empirical analysis to examine the effectiveness of these non-semantic redirection strategies for unlearning. 6.5.1. Design of ROCR Variants. The primary distinction between our two proposed variants lies in the computation 7. Related Work LLM unlearning aims to erase or suppress specific knowledge in LLMs, demonstrating promise for privacy protection and hazardous knowledge removalcore challenges in contemporary LLM security research [21]. Existing approaches primarily employ tailored unlearning losses coupled with fine-tuning to eliminate target knowledge. The canonical GA [13] method performs unlearning by ascending gradients on forget corpora, with variants like GD [38] incorporating retain-set fine-tuning to improve knowledge preservation. Meanwhile, NPO [14] enhances DPO [12] by exclusively using forget samples as negative pairs, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Another line of work evaluates alignment-breaking strategies like RT [11] and DPO and are frequently evaluated as unlearning methods in mainstream benchmarks [11]. In addition, recent advances including RMU [39] and LUNAR [40] propose methods aiming to perturb hidden states on forget corpora, though still relying on fine-tuning paradigms. Numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate unlearning effectiveness. For instance, TOFU [23] pre-injects fictional character knowledge via fine-tuning as the unlearning target, while WMDP [41] focuses on dangerous bio-safety knowledge. MUSE [42] assesses multidimensional performance, such as scalability, whereas RWKU [11] employs real-world tasks as unlearning targets to simulate practical scenarios. However, recent research indicates that existing evaluations may be unreliable, and begin to aware the importance of the task format. For instance, Thaker et al. [15] argue that current benchmarks are weak measures of progress, suggesting issues like TOFU and WMDP encouraging overfitting, and emphasize the importance of diverse query types; Lynch et al. [16] found that the some unlearning method performs poorly on multiple choice tasks. Building on this line of work, we are the first to systematically characterize the Form-dependent Bias problem in LLM Unlearning, extending its scope beyond task formats to include token-level knowledge forms. We construct the more comprehensive multi-task benchmark ORT and the ROCR method to offer support and insight for future security research. 8. Conclusion Our work identifies the Form-Dependent Bias issue in mainstream LLM unlearning paradigms, where existing methods exhibit strong reliance on the format of training data, failing to generalize across downstream tasks with varying task formulations or knowledge representations. We demonstrated two specific patterns of this bias in downstream tasks, underscoring the tangible threat it poses to real-world application safety. To facilitate more comprehensive evaluation of this issue and support future in-depth research, we constructed the ORT benchmark, results from which demonstrate that the Form-Dependent Bias problem is both widespread and severe in practical scenarios. We Figure 11. Performance of ROCR with parameter modifications at different layers. but it exhibits more pronounced cross-task fluctuations than the original version, performing best on QA tasks, shows slightly stronger cross-task failure issue. The unlearning effect of ROCR-noise is slightly inferior to ROCR and ROCR-reject, which might be because the latter two not only prevent the model from recalling original knowledge but also induce the model to invoke other knowledge or perform rejection behaviors, thereby strengthening the suppression of the unlearning target. The standard version of ROCR demonstrates the most stable performance with minimal perturbation to the retain set, likely due to its use of naturally extracted native representations from the model as redirection targets. However, the strong performance of these two variants also underscores the immense potential of the ROCR framework. 6.6. Effect of Hyperparameters (RQ6) ROCR involves relatively few hyperparameters and does not require careful tuning. The primary hyperparameter is the layer at which the MLP modification is applied. We conducted simple experiment on Llama3-8B-Instruct, varying the modified layer and measuring unlearning performance. The results are shown in Figure 11, and lead to the following observations: Obs 8: ROCR performs best when modifications are applied at shallower layers, with performance rising and then falling as the layer depth increases. As shown in results, the forgetting effectiveness on the Forget set (which is inversely correlated with the relative probability change displayed) initially increases then declines as the modification layer deepens, generally performing better in shallower layers. This could be because redirecting the representation early in the shallow layers can interfere with the models entire inference process sooner, more effectively inhibiting the recall of knowledge related to the forgotten target. However, if the layer is too shallow, the model might not have yet formed well-developed concept representations, which would lead to reduced effectiveness. This is consistent with findings from LLM interpretability research, which suggest that attention mechanisms aggregate information from sentences in shallow layers to form entity representations. advocate that effective LLM Unlearning should be formindependent and then proposed ROCR, novel unlearning method based on concept redirection, as promising step towards this goal. Extensive experiments validate that ROCR achieves superior unlearning performance and better preserves unrelated knowledge, while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities across downstream tasks, offering promising direction for future research."

Details on the ORT Benchmark The ORT benchmark is specifically designed to evaluate machine unlearning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs). Beyond the standard objectives of forgetting target knowledge while retaining unrelated information, ORT places significant emphasis on assessing the generalization TABLE 2.

This focus is crucial for detecting and preventing potential FormDependent Bias. To be noted, part of the ORT dataset are sourced from existing open-source unlearning benchmarks. We have specifically restructured and extended the RWKU dataset, constructing new data and added novel tasks, while building upon its original training task settings to enable more comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the FormDependent Bias issue we investigate. Dataset Composition Details. ORT comprises 200 unlearning targets, each corresponding to specific knowledge about real-world individuals. For each target, the benchmark includes training corpora provided in three distinct formats designed for various unlearning methodologies, alongside evaluation tasks presented in four distinct formats for both the Forget Set and the Retain Set. The training corpora are tailored to different unlearning approaches: (1) Pretraining style unstructured text, suitable for methods like GA and NPO. (2) Rejection-response QA pairs, designed for methods such as RT. (3) Positive/negative sample QA pairs, typically utilized by methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). It is important to note that our methods ROCR do not require explicit training corpora but instead directly extract the concept to be forgotten using the unlearning targets name. For evaluation, ORT includes tasks in four diverse formats: (1) Simple Question Answering (QA). (2) Fillin-the-Blank (FB). (3) Multiple-Choice Problems (MCP), specifically designed to evaluate forgetting performance on potentially unseen tokens. (4) Subtoken QA, also aimed at assessing generalization at the subtoken level unseen elements. To simulate realistic scenarios and enable comprehensive assessment, each unlearning target includes 300+ training samples per format and 10+ evaluation data points per format. These evaluation data are provided for both the Forget Set and the Retain Set, allowing for detailed measurement of the trade-off between knowledge erasure and optimizer, with 20-step warm-up phase at the beginning of training. Appendix C. Case Study Under Adversarial Prompting We supplement our analysis with generation examples of ROCR-unlearned models under complex adversarial prompts, using the Stephen King Donald Trump redirection scenario. As shown in Figure 12, ROCR maintains safety even in adversarial settings, while demonstrating exceptional generalization: the model consistently leverages knowledge about Donald Trump without revealing information about Stephen King. Notably, ROCR successfully blocks knowledge recall during in-context and context-hint attacks where substantial contextual clues are provided, and tended to use knowledge of the redirection target to answer. This further highlights its robustness and generalization capabilities. Appendix D. Further Discussion on Extensions and Future Directions The ROCR implementation discussed in this work primarily redirects unlearning targets to existing semantic concepts. Our experiments have validated that this redirection is highly generalizable and controllable. Building upon this controllability, we emphasize that future research could explore pre-training fictional anchor entity during model pre-training, which would be specifically designed to serve as redirection target for various concepts, allowing for more flexible adjustment of the models output when this concept is activated. This could lead to more controllable model outputs compared to redirecting to existing entities. In addition, this approach would enable downstream model deployers to quickly perform unlearning or achieve efficient alignment in practical scenarios by redirecting specific concepts to this entity. Furthermore, exploring alternative avenues to mitigate the form-dependent bias in LLM unlearning remains critical challenge; transforming LLM unlearning into reliable safety tool still requires further paradigm advancements. We leave these exploration for future research. irrelevant knowledge retention across different task formats. Detailed statistics on the dataset composition are presented in Table 2. Dataset Construction Details. In the construction of the evaluation tasks, particularly the MCP and Subtoken QA formats for assessing unseen generalization, we leveraged the API of the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 model. Specifically, we prompted the LLM to convert the formats of the standard QA and FB tasks, thereby generating the new Subtoken QA and MCP tasks. These generated tasks are explicitly designed for evaluating unseen token generalization. It is crucial design aspect that the knowledge probed by these Subtoken QA and MCP tasks is fundamentally the same as that covered by the original QA and FB tasks, which provides more compelling evidence that unlearned methods may fail to generalize this effectively across different task formats involving out-of-distribution tokens. To validate the quality and relevance of our dataset, we evaluated the performance of the original, pre-unlearned Llama3 and Mistral base models on these evaluation tasks and report their answer probabilities in our main results. The observed probabilities are notably high across all formats, indicating that both base models strongly retain the knowledge associated with these specific formats and tasks. This also serves as crucial validation of the data quality and confirms that the tasks can effectively probe the targeted knowledge before any unlearning is applied. Appendix B. Experiment Setup Details In our main experiments, we report the average performance metrics across the first 100 unlearning targets, evaluated in single-target unlearning setting. We selected two widely-used large language models as the base models for unlearning: Llama3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instructv0.3. ROCR and Variants. In main experiments, ROCR consistently edits MLPs at layers [4,5,6]. The standard implementation selects semantic entity as redirection target (Donald Trump in our case). For ROCR reject, we optimize the reject response vector using AdamW (lr=0.1, 25 steps) to maximize the probability of the model outputting Unfortunately cant. Baselines. For all other baseline unlearning methods, we employed LoRA-based [43] fine-tuning approach. The models were trained on the respective unlearning training corpora provided by the ORT benchmark. Regarding training hyperparameters, we unified the number of training epochs to 5 across all methods. The LoRA rank was consistently set to 8, and LoRA alpha to 16. We adjusted the learning rate for each baseline individually to accommodate the specific training dynamics of different methods. The final learning rates used were within the range of 1 105 to 1 104.
