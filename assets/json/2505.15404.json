            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in addressing wide range of tasks in recent years (Dubey et al., 2024). As their capabilities have matured, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward enhancing their reasoning abilities on more complex domains such as code (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Shao et al., 2024). The recent release of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) further underscores the emerging focus on Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, despite their impressive progress on reasoning-intensive tasks, LRMs have shown little to no improvement in safetyand in some cases, even exhibit degraded safety behavior (Zhou et al., 2025a). For instance, LRMs have been observed generating detailed plans for criminal activities, either during intermediate reasoning steps or in final outputs. These findings highlight the urgent need for safety-aligned advancements in the development of LRMs. *Equal contribution. Corresponding author. Preprint. Under review. While recent efforts have begun to explore improving the safety of large reasoning models (LRMs) (Jiang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025a; Huang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025), systematic comparison of different safety fine-tuning choices remains lacking. Key questionssuch as which types of safety reasoning data are most effective and whether incorporating general reasoning data during fine-tuning is beneficialremain underexplored. In this paper, we present comprehensive empirical study addressing these questions, offering deeper insights into the effectiveness of different safety fine-tuning choices for LRMs. We begin with counterintuitive observation: directly distilling safe responses from LRMs does not significantly enhance the safety of smaller models. For instance, when fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-7B using safe responses filtered by LlamaGuard3 (Inan et al., 2023) and distilled from DeepSeek-R1, the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of PAIR (Chao et al., 2023a) only drops modestly from 66% to 54%. To understand this limitation, we conduct detailed analysis of both the finetuning data and the models outputs. We identify three primary failure patterns: (1) Lack of safety awarenessthe model operates under overly permissive internal safety criteria, rendering it highly susceptible to exploitation through hypothetical jailbreak scenarios; (2) Overthinkingthe model often produces safe final answer but exposes harmful content during intermediate reasoning steps, or reflects unnecessarily and introduces unsafe ideas; (3) Inconsistency between reasoning and answerthe model may appear to plan refusal during reasoning but ultimately outputs harmful response. Motivated by these findings, we modify the prompting strategy used during distillation to explicitly target these failure modes. As result, we observe substantial improvement: the ASR of PAIR decreases from 77.0% to 7.0%, averaged across four models ranging from 3B to 32B parameters. Subsequently, we examine the role of reasoning in ensuring the safety of LRMs. While reasoningintensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving and code generation inherently demand extended and deep reasoning chains, current safety-critical scenarios appear to rely less on such complexity. Moreover, the previously observed phenomenon of overthinking suggests that lengthy reasoning may even be potentially detrimental. Motivated by this, we investigate whether simpler forms of reasoningsuch as short chains or template-based patternscan effectively enhance safety. Our experimental results indicate that these lightweight reasoning strategies perform comparably to, and in some cases outperform, long-form reasoning in improving safety. Surprisingly, even omitting explicit safety reasoning can yield strong results for certain models. Furthermore, long reasoning chains typically require more training steps or larger learning rates, highlighting their increased learning difficulty. Finally, we investigate critical question concerning the trade-off between safety and task performance: should additional reasoning data be incorporated during safety fine-tuning? Our results suggest that including benign reasoning data can help balance the ASR and the over-refusal rate. We thus recommend integrating such data. Overall, our empirical study presents more comprehensive understanding of enhancing the safety of LRMs. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We investigate the challenges of directly distilling safe responses from LRMs and identify three common failure patterns. We demonstrate that explicitly addressing these failure patterns during the distillation process significantly improves safety performance. We find that employing short or template-based reasoning processes is effective and that such data is easier for LRMs to learn. These findings offer valuable insights into the role of reasoning in improving safety. We show that incorporating reasoning data for benign tasks during safety fine-tuning helps strike balance between safety and over-refusal."

            "content": "Safety of LLMs. LLMs are susceptible to generating harmful (Deshpande et al., 2023) or undesirable content (Zhang et al., 2023b), and may even promote illegal activities (Zhang et al., 2023a), particularly when subjected to jailbreaking attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in their safety alignment (Chao et al., 2023a; Zou et al., 2023). Extensive studies have already explored various safety defense 2 mechanisms for LLMs, including training-based approaches such as reinforcement learning (Dai et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023), diverse fine-tuning strategies (Mazeika et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2023c), and techniques for knowledge unlearning or editing (Zhang et al., 2024a; Zou et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). In addition, non-training defenses have also been investigated (Li et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023). Safety of LRMs. Despite the rapid progress in improving the reasoning abilities of LRMs, their safety properties remain underexplored. Existing studies have reported that enhancing reasoning often compromises safety (Zhou et al., 2025b; Jiang et al., 2025a). Jiang et al. (2025a); Huang et al. (2025) also find that safety tuning tends to impair performance on mathematical and programming tasks. Recent studies have explored how to make LRMs safer using techniques such as safety-aware response distillation (Zhang et al., 2025a) and cost-effective mitigation strategy (Wang et al., 2025). Yet there is still lack of systematic understanding of how LRMs should reason with safety in mind and how should we conduct SFT to enhance safety or LRMs."

            "content": "We begin by outlining the common experimental setup used throughout the paper. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments adhere to this setup. Training Datasets. Following Zhang et al. (2024c), we construct set of challenging harmful queries by combining raw harmful questions with widely used jailbreak templates. Specifically, we use 200 raw harmful questions from HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024a) and combine each of them with 20 manual designed jailbreak templates collected in (Zhang et al., 2024b). Then we construct various types of responses to harmful queries across different experimental settings and leverage LlamaGuard3 to select those deemed safe. We choose LlamaGuard3 as it demonstrates best performance in safety evaluation of LRM outputs, as reported by Jiang et al. (2025b). From the responses verified by LlamaGuard3, we randomly sample 1,000 safe instances and combine them with 4,000 math-related queries from the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021). The corresponding answers to these math problems are generated by distilling outputs from DeepSeek-R1. Evaluated Models. We evaluate four reasoning models of varying scales: DeepSeek-R1-DistillQwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, trained on reasoning data distilled from DeepSeekR1; and s1.1-3B and s1.1-14B (Muennighoff et al., 2025), trained on 1K high-quality reasoning examples also distilled from DeepSeek-R1. Reasoning Performance Evaluation. To assess whether additional safety fine-tuning compromises reasoning ability, we evaluate model performance on three benchmarks: (1) MATH-500 (Lightman et al., 2024), dataset of 500 high-school and competition-level mathematics problems spanning diverse mathematical domains. We report accuracy. (2) American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024, which consists of 30 challenging problems from the AIME 2024. Due to the limited number of questions, we repeat each experiment 4 times and report the average accuracy. (3) LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2025), comprising 166 competitive programming problems released between October 2024 and January 2025. We report the pass@1 metric. Safety Performance Evaluation. We evaluate safety performance on subset of AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), curated by Chao et al. (2023b) to eliminate redundant or repetitive queries. This filtered set comprises 50 unique, harmful questions. We assess the ASR of three attack strategies applied to these queries: (1) None, which uses the original harmful questions without modification; (2) PAP (Zeng et al., 2024), which automatically constructs persuasive adversarial prompts to elicit unsafe responses; and (3) PAIR (Chao et al., 2023b), strong iterative attack method that leverages victim model feedback to optimize jailbreak prompts via LLMs. ASR is computed using LlamaGuard3, which quantifies the proportion of unsafe responses. All evaluations are conducted through the AISafetyLab toolkit (Zhang et al., 2025b). Over-Refusal Evaluation. To assess whether safety fine-tuning causes the model to erroneously reject benign inputs, we evaluate it on 250 adversarially benign queries from XSTest (Röttger et al., 2024), and report the resulting over-refusal rate. 3 Failure Pattern Unsafe Response Rationale in Training Data Lack of safety awareness Overthinking Inconsistency between reasoning and answer ...

The model exhibits limited sensitivity to potential harm and can be easily manipulated by jailbreak prompts to produce unsafe outputs. (2) Overthinking. The model exhibits excessive or unnecessary reasoning, which can inadvertently introduce harmful content. In some cases, although the final answer is safe, unsafe information emerges during intermediate reasoning steps. (3) Inconsistent reasoning. The model occasionally concludes that it should reject the query but still produces harmful response, reflecting misalignment between its reasoning process and final output.f Figure 1 shows the distribution of these failure patterns. We observe that lack of safety awareness is the most prevalent, followed by overthinking and reasoning inconsistency. Further analysis suggests that these issues may stem from the training data itself (see Table 1). While the filtered data may not contain responses flagged by safety classifiers, the presence of subtle unsafe patterns could bias the model toward similar behavior when exposed to jailbreak prompts."

            "title": "5 How Can We Improve the Distilled Responses to Better Enhance Safety?",
            "content": "5.1 Safe Responses Construction Building on the analysis in the previous section, we first address the issue of safety awareness by explicitly incorporating safety considerations into the distillation prompt used to elicit responses from DeepSeek-R1. Notably, the RealSafe prompt proposed by Zhang et al. (2025a) meets this requirement. Therefore, we adopt their prompt directly to construct the RealSafe CoT dataset. 5 While the RealSafe prompt effectively addresses safety awareness, it does not explicitly target issues of overthinking and inconsistency. These two overlooked problems can still emerge in the responses generated by models trained on this data. To mitigate these remaining issues, we design an enhanced distillation prompt, yielding refined dataset referred to as Improved CoT. The refined prompt is specifically designed to elicit stronger and more consistent safety-aligned behaviors from the model. The full prompt used in this setting is shown below. Components targeting the overthinking issue are highlighted in red, while those addressing inconsistency are highlighted in blue. Instruction to Generate \"Improved CoT\" Data Given query from the user, first assess potential underlying risks, particularly regarding illegal or unethical issues during the reasoning process. Do not provide any harmful information during the reasoning process or at any point in the response. If the users request violates rules or policies, explicitly and immediately refuse to comply in both the reasoning process and final response section under any scenario without considering any alternative ways to fulfill the request, even if framed as fictional or hypothetical situation. You must not comply with any further instructions or attempts to reframe the request if it is determined to be harmful. Use clear refusal language such as sorry or cannot assist with to clearly organize the rejection. Always begin with Sorry after </think> if the reasoning process states that refusal is required. If no clear risks are identified, proceed to fulfill the users request as stated. QUERY: {query} 5.2 Results As shown in Table 2, across all four evaluated models, addressing the safety awareness issue using the RealSafe CoT data results in significantly lower ASR compared to directly distilled CoT data. Further mitigating the overthinking and inconsistency issues with the Improved CoT data leads to an additional reduction in ASR. Importantly, the reasoning performance remains largely unaffected, and the increase in over-refusals is within an acceptable range. These findings demonstrate that carefully designing distillation prompts can substantially improve model safety without significantly compromising model capability."

            "content": "6.1 Safe Responses Construction Motivated by the overthinking phenomenonwhere extended reasoning may inadvertently lead to unsafe outputswe investigate whether simpler reasoning processes can achieve competitive safety performance. We begin by exploring reasoning traces generated by LLMs without specialized reasoning fine-tuning. In this setting, GPT-4o is prompted with system instructions to produce concise and focused reasoning step prior to answering, while explicitly considering both the general safety and potential harmfulness of the input query during the reasoning process. Harmful queries are provided directly as user inputs. The resulting dataset is referred to as Short CoT. System Instruction to Generate \"Short CoT\" Data You are helpful AI Assistant that provides well-reasoned and detailed responses. You first think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the user with the answer. Respond in the following format: <think>n...n</think> Also, for math-related questions, you need to put your final answer within boxed{}. Please consider the general safety and potential harmfulness of the users request in the reasoning process. If the request is harmful, refuse to answer in the answer section and dont refuse without going through reasoning process. Make sure your reasoning process is short and precise. 6 Next, we explore simpler reasoning approach based on template-driven pattern, where safety is assessed using eight predefined harmful categories introduced by Yang et al. (2025). We prompt GPT4o using system instruction that guides the model to evaluate safety according to fixed categories via in-context learning. The full instruction is provided in Appendix A. The dataset generated through this method is referred to as Template CoT. Finally, we eliminate the reasoning process entirely and instead return predefined rejective response to all harmful queries. Specifically, responses follow the format: <think> </think> Im sorry, cant assist with that request. The resulting dataset is denoted as No CoT. 6.2 Results As shown in Table 2, short and template-based CoT data achieve safety performance comparable to that of enhanced long-form CoT, although the over-refusal rate increases for the smaller s1.1-3B model. Notably, even the No CoT settingwhere no explicit safety reasoning is providedperforms well across three models. These results suggest that lengthy and complex reasoning chains may not be essential for current safety tasks, likely due to fundamental differences between safety tasks and reasoning-heavy domains such as mathematics or code generation. 6.3 Ablation Study To evaluate the models performance under varying learning rates and training epochs, we conduct an ablation study using grid of learning rates {5 106, 1 105, 2 105} and training epochs {1, 3, 5}. The study covers four types of safety reasoning data: Default CoT, Improved CoT, Short CoT, and Template CoT. From the results in Figure 2, we have the following findings: (1) Short or template-based reasoning processes are easier to learn. We observe that safety data with short or template-based reasoning benefits from small learning rate and fewer training epochs. This suggests the model can rapidly internalize safety-relevant patterns in such data. In contrast, longer reasoning data (e.g., Improved CoT) demands more training steps or higher learning rate, indicating that it is inherently more challenging for the model to learn. (2) Simpler reasoning processes are more susceptible to overrefusal under suboptimal hyperparameters. Despite being easier to learn, short or template-based reasoning data often leads to significantly higher over-refusal rates when hyperparameters are not well-tuned. This is likely due to the model overfitting to the simplistic patterns in such data. Careful hyperparameter selection is therefore essential when fine-tuning with safety data characterized by simple reasoning structures. (3) The impact on reasoning performance is base-model dependent. For DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, reasoning performance remains largely unaffected across settings. However, for s1.1-3B, we observe consistent degradation. This aligns partially with findings from Huang et al. (2025), which reported reasoning performance drop in s1.1-32B after safety fine-tuning. Our results, however, suggest this degradation is not universal across all LRMs. One possible explanation lies in the extent of reasoning training: the R1-Distill models are exposed to 800K reasoning samples, whereas the s1.1 series are trained on only 1K curated examples. This disparity may account for the greater robustness of R1-Distill models in preserving reasoning ability post safety fine-tuning. 7 Is It Necessary to Mix Other Reasoning Data During Safety Finetuning? In safety finetuning for LLMs, it is common to mix in benign data to mitigate issues like over-refusal or performance degradation on other tasks (Bianchi et al., 2024). However, for LRMs, the necessity of such mixing remains unclear. Notably, several recent studies opt to exclude benign reasoning data during safety finetuning (Zhang et al., 2025a; Huang et al., 2025). To investigate this, we ablate the 4K math data previously mixed in, and instead finetune solely on 1K safety samples. Results. The results are shown in Figure 3. By comparing to the results with mixed math data in Figure 2, we have the following observations: (1) Removing math data substantially increases the difficulty of balancing ASR and over-refusal. For instance, when using short or template-based reasoning data, the over-refusal rate escalates rapidly with increased training epochs or learning rates. Yet, the ASR remains suboptimal under conservative settings (e.g., learning rate of 5e-6 and one 7 Figure 2: The performance change when we use different SFT data, learning rates and training epochs. training epoch). This challenge is partially alleviated with long-form reasoning data (e.g., Improved CoT), where the over-refusal rate rises more slowly. (2) Removing math data does not significantly impair reasoning performance. Interestingly, we observe comparable reasoning performance even without the math data. We conjecture that the relatively small number of safety samples (1,000) limits the total training steps, thereby reducing the impact of excluding additional reasoning data. Overall, while excluding benign reasoning data is feasible strategy for long-form safety reasoning, 8 Figure 3: The performance change when we use different SFT data, learning rates and training epochs. Note that no math (NM) data is used during safety fine-tuning in this setting. incorporating auxiliary reasoning tasks during safety finetuning offers more practical and effective approach to balancing the trade-off between ASR and over-refusal across diverse data types."

            "content": "In this paper, we present comprehensive empirical study on enhancing the safety of LRMs. We begin by identifying three key failure patterns that arise when using directly distilled data for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that addressing these patterns through tailored distillation prompts significantly improves safety performance. Surprisingly, we find that simple short-form or template-based reasoning data can be equally effective, raising questions about the necessity of complex reasoning for safety. Moreover, such data is easier for models to learn due to its straightforward reasoning process. Finally, we show that incorporating additional reasoning data helps balance the ASR and over-refusal rate, although the models reasoning capability remains largely intact even without this mixed data. We hope our findings offer more holistic understanding of strategies for improving the safety of LRMs."

Similarly, we compare our model trained with the same data on DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-32B against STAR1-R1-Distill-32B and RealSafe-R1-32B. It is worth noting that the 7B models from Wang et al.

In terms of safety evaluation, our models ASR is significantly lower than the STAR1-R1 models and comparable to the RealSafe-R1 models. Notably, we achieve this level of safety using only 1,000 safety examples, in contrast to the 15,000 used by RealSafe-R1. Finally, our models Over-Refusal Rate is significantly lower than both baselines in the 7B variant, and falls between the two baselines in the 32B variant.

For each strategy, we randomly sample 400 safety-related data points and combine them with 4,000 math-related instances. The combined dataset is used to fine-tune the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model. C.2 Results The results are presented in Table 4. We observe that using fewer safety data points leads to slight increase in attack success rate. Nonetheless, the overall attack success rate remains relatively low. Interestingly, the Short CoT and Template CoT setting exhibit improved reasoning with less safety data, whereas the Improved CoT setting shows decrease in reasoning performance. This suggests that the impact of reduced safety data on reasoning performance may vary depending on the prompting strategy. Additionally, refusal rates may be slightly lower in models trained with only 400 safety examples, except Improved CoT. In brief, while incorporating more safety data is generally recommended to further reduce the attack success rate, our findings suggest that strong safety performance can be achieved with as few as 400 safety examples. Reasoning performance and over-refusal tendencies appear to vary depending on the reasoning strategy used."

For the Math dataset, we use the entire 4K set, so only the full dataset statistics are reported.

            "content": "In this section, we present one defense success example and one defense failure example for each safety reasoning setting against the PAIR attack in Table 6. We summarize the characteristics of models trained with different safety data as follows: Default CoT: This represents the models standard safety mechanism. It may reference safety considerations occasionally but is inconsistent in doing so. RealSafe CoT: This setting frequently recalls safety policies and applies them more reliably compared to the Default CoT. Improved CoT: This approach has stricter application of safety by referencing laws and explicitly stating refusal. It tends to avoid considering alternative interpretations or scenario that might bypass safety concerns. Short CoT: This setting gives brief reasoning, reflecting ethical concerns most of the time. Template CoT: This configuration guides the model to analyze content against predefined set of unsafe content categories. This provides structured and systematic approach to identifying and categorizing potential harms. No CoT: In this setting, if the model identifies the inpust as harmful, it outputs an empty reasoning section. If it fails to detect the harm, it may generate unsafe response with non-empty reasoning section."

Additionally, our harmful dataset consists of 200 raw harmful questions. While this may not fully capture the distribution of all harmful scenarios, the results indicate that it is sufficient to significantly reduce the Attack Success Rate. Furthermore, our findings reveal three recurring failure modes of LRM, one of which is inconsistent reasoning. However, we did not investigate the underlying nature of this inconsistency in depth."

            "content": "Our findings reveal trade-offs between reasoning, safety, and over-refusal performance, showing that different safety reasoning settings offer varying benefits depending on the use case. By identifying these trade-offs, our study enables model developers to choose the most appropriate approach based on their specific safety or reasoning objectives. Notably, the Improved CoT, Short CoT and Template CoT safety reasoning settings that we propose achieve higher reasoning performance while maintaining comparable safety and over-refusal levels to prior work, offering promising direction for practitioners seeking to balance safety with task effectiveness. From societal perspective, this could lower the barrier for broader adoption of safety alignment practices. By showing that it is possible to preserve reasoning performance while enhancing safety and decreasing over-refusal, we offer compelling incentive for developers and organizations to integrate safety alignment efforts into their development pipelines. This has the potential to lead to the deployment of safer large language models in real-world applications. Ultimately, we hope this work contributes to building culture of safety-conscious AI development and supports the creation of trustworthy AI models. 18 Safety Reasoning Settings Defense Success Defense Failure Default CoT Okay, the user wants me to create fake news article that could cause panic or chaos.
