            "title": "1 Introduction\nMental health disorders affect hundreds of millions of people world-\nwide and remain a leading contributor to disability, social inequal-\nity, and unmet clinical needs [9, 21, 33]. As individuals increas-\ningly turn to online platforms for information, support, and self-\nassessment, the Web has become a critical medium for expanding\naccess to mental health care and advancing social good. Artificial\nintelligence (AI) plays a growing role in this shift: assisting indi-\nviduals understand their conditions [30, 36, 39], supporting coun-\nselors in developing treatment strategies [23, 34], and helping clin-\nicians in decision-making [35]. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) [11, 18] have been rapidly adopted across web-based men-\ntal health applications, due to their strong linguistic capabilities,\nbroad world knowledge, and ability to engage in natural, empa-\nthetic dialogue. Their potential impact is considerable: LLMs can\nprovide scalable, always-available guidance and reach populations\nthat traditional services often fail to serve.",
            "content": "However, deploying LLMs in such sensitive, high-stakes settings requires more than producing fluent responses or superficially accurate predictions. Effective mental health support depends on transparent, coherent, and context-grounded reasoning that reflects how human clinicians interpret complex, subjective narratives. When LLMs misread user self-reports, rely on incomplete reasoning, or accept subjective statements as factual, they may exaggerate symptoms, provide misleading feedback, or inadvertently amplify users anxiety [27]. At scale, these risks threaten public trust and can undermine the social-good promise of AI-enabled mental health support systems. These risks underscore the urgent need for LLMs capable of responsible, clinically aligned reasoning rather than merely generating plausible answers [10, 17]. Recent efforts [4, 8, 40], have begun exploring how LLMs can better support mental-health tasks. Such as, Psyche-R1 [4] jointly integrates empathy, psychological knowledge, and chain-of-thought reasoning through large-scale synthesis pipeline and hybrid GRPOSFT training. Psy-Interpreter [8] enhances implicit mental-state inference using expert-annotated scenarios and trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework that imitates clinician-like reasoning. PsychCounsel-Bench [40] assesses whether LLMs meet counseling knowledge standards, finding that only frontier models surpass certification-level performance [31]. Despite these advances, current methods still have important limitations in both method design and evaluation as showin in Table 1. Most existing approaches focus on emotional understanding, knowledge tests, or supervised reasoning tailored to narrow set of tasks, without systematically modeling core stages of clinical reasoning. Yet effective mental-health support requires reasoning across several interconnected processes: appraisal (recognizing maladaptive thought patterns), diagnosis (identifying likely conditions), intervention (selecting appropriate therapeutic strategies), abstraction (synthesizing structured evidence), and verification (detecting inaccurate or misleading mental-health information). Furthermore, existing methods focus primarily on task accuracy while overlooking the quality and reliability of the reasoning process. Reliable mental-health support requires LLMs to produce transparent, coherent, and context-grounded reasoning across several key dimensions: reasoning conciseness (avoiding unnecessary complexity or repetition), logical coherence (providing stepwise, case-specific justification), hallucination avoidance (not introducing unsupported facts), task understanding (following the intended objective without drift), and internal consistency (maintaining non-contradictory reasoning throughout). Addressing these aspects is essential for assessing and developing LLMs that can perform the step-wise, integrative reasoning that underlies appraisal, diagnosis, intervention, abstraction, and verification in real mental-health practice. To fill this gap, we present MentraSuite1, unified suite of benchmarks, datasets, and models for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We introduce MentraBench, comprehensive benchmark that evaluates five essential aspects of clinical and counseling cognition: appraisal, diagnosis, intervention, abstraction, and verification. MentraBench spans six tasks and 13 datasets, built by refining existing resources and constructing new ones. Unlike prior benchmarks focused primarily on accuracy, MentraBench emphasizes the quality of reasoning trajectories, assessing five key dimensions: reasoning conciseness, logical coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We then introduce Mindora, post-trained model optimized for diverse mental-health reasoning tasks and more reliable reasoning processes. Mindora adopts novel hybrid supervised fine tuningreinforcement learning (SFTRL) training strategy with an LLMbased inconsistency-detection reward that dynamically enforces internal consistency while enhancing reasoning depth and generalization to unseen cases. To support Mindoras training, we construct high-quality reasoning data through Reasoning Trajectory Generation (RTG) strategy. RTG filters samples by difficulty and applies structured rewriting procedure that produces concise, readable, and well-balanced reasoning trajectories, directly mitigating issues such as over-elaboration and improving reasoning clarity. Extensive experiments on MentraBench covering 20 evaluated LLMs, show that Mindora achieves the highest average performance across all 13 datasets, outperforming strong baselines such as GPT4o-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Trajectory-level analysis further confirms remarkable performance across all five reasoning dimensions, demonstrating Mindoras superior ability to reason concisely, accurately, and coherently in complex mental-health scenarios. In summary, our contribution can be summarized as follows: (1) We present MentraBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs reasoning abilities across five 1The code and data are available in MentraSuite.

𝑄Quality(𝑎) quantifies the correctness of 𝑎 based on task-specific benchmark criteria, with values in [0, 1]. It is defined separately for three task types: (1) Single-choice questions: Let 𝑦 be the ground-truth answer. Then: 𝑄Quality(𝑎) = { if the final conclusion in 𝒯 = 𝑦 , 1 0 otherwise. (2) (2) Multiple-choice questions: Let 𝑌 = {𝑦 𝑘 } be the set of ground-truth answers, and 𝑌 = {𝑦1, 𝑦2, ..., 𝑦𝑚} be the set of answers in 𝒯. The quality score is the Jaccard similarity between 𝑌 and 𝑌 : 2 , ..., 𝑦 1 , 𝑦 𝑄Quality(𝑎) = 𝑌 𝑌 𝑌 𝑌 . (3) (3) Short-answer questions: Let 𝒦 = {𝑘1, 𝑘2, ..., 𝑘𝑛} be the set of key scoring points for the task, and 𝒦hit 𝒦 be the subset of points covered in 𝒯. Then: 𝑄Quality(𝑎) = 𝒦hit 𝒦 . (4) Training Pipeline. The training process proceeds in iterations 𝑡 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑇max (where 𝑇max is the total number of training steps), with each iteration consisting of data sampling, weight scheduling, loss computation, and parameter update stages. MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Step 1: Data Sampling. At each step 𝑡, we sample two mini-batches: An SFT mini-batch ℬSFT 𝒟SFT with batch size 𝐵SFT = 64 (consistent with the experimental setup), where each sample is (𝑥𝑖, 𝑦 𝑖 ) 𝒳𝒴 ( 𝑥𝑖 is the prompt, 𝑦 is the expert solution). An RL mini-batch 𝑖 ℬRL 𝒟RL with dynamic batch size 𝐵RL, where each sample is (𝑥𝑗 , 𝑎𝑗 ) 𝒳 𝒴 ( 𝑎𝑗 is the model-generated solution via rollout). The rollout for 𝒟RL generation uses temperature 𝜏 = 1.0, with 𝐾 = 8 candidate solutions sampled per prompt. Step 2: Adaptive Weight Scheduling. The global weight 𝜇(𝑡) (balancing ℒSFT and ℒRL) follows warmup-decay schedule to transition from expert imitation to RL exploration: (1) Warmup phase (1 𝑡 𝑡warmup, 𝑡warmup = 200 steps): 𝜇(𝑡) = 𝜇valley + (𝜇peak 𝜇valley) 𝑡 𝑡warmup , (5) where 𝜇peak = 0.5 (maximum SFT influence) and 𝜇valley = 0.02 (minimum SFT influence). (2) Decay phase (𝑡warmup < 𝑡 𝑡warmup + 𝑡decay, 𝑡decay = 400 steps): 𝜇(𝑡) = 𝜇peak (𝜇peak 𝜇valley) 𝑡 𝑡warmup 𝑡decay . (6) The token-wise weight 𝜙(𝑦 𝑡 ; 𝜋𝜃 ) (for SFT loss modulation) is defined based on the policys probability of generating the expert token 𝑦 𝑡 (given prompt 𝑥 and prefix 𝑦 <𝑡 ): 𝜙(𝑦 𝑡 ; 𝜋𝜃 ) = 𝑝𝑡 (1 𝑝𝑡 ), (7) 𝑡 𝑥, 𝑦 where 𝑝𝑡 = 𝜋𝜃 (𝑦 <𝑡 ). This parabolic function prioritizes learning for tokens where the policy is uncertain ( 𝑝𝑡 0.5 ) while downweighting certain ( 𝑝𝑡 1 ) or irrelevant ( 𝑝𝑡 0 ) tokens. Step 3: Loss Computation and Parameter Update. The total loss ℒtotal(𝜃) is weighted combination of the SFT loss (with tokenwise weighting) and the RL loss: ℒtotal(𝜃) = (1 𝜇(𝑡)) ℒGRPO(𝜃) + 𝜇(𝑡) ℒSFT𝜙 (𝜃), (8) SFT loss with token-wise weighting ℒSFT𝜙(𝜃) is computed over ℬSFT, minimizing the weighted negative log-likelihood of expert solutions: ℒSFT𝜙 (𝜃) = 1 (𝑥𝑖,𝑦 𝑖 )ℬSFT 𝑦 𝑖 𝑖 )ℬSFT (𝑥𝑖,𝑦 𝑦 𝑖 𝑡=1 𝜙(𝑦 𝑖,𝑡 ; 𝜋𝜃 ) log 𝜋𝜃 (𝑦 𝑖,𝑡 𝑥𝑖, 𝑦 𝑖,<𝑡 ). (9) GRPO loss ℒGRPO(𝜃) is optimized over ℬRL to maximize the expected reward, using clipped surrogate objective (consistent with PPO-style updates): ℒGRPO(𝜃) = 1 (𝑥𝑗 ,𝑎𝑗 )ℬRL 𝑎𝑗 𝑎𝑗 𝑡=1 (𝑥𝑗 ,𝑎𝑗 )ℬRL min (𝑟𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃)𝐴𝑗 , clip(𝑟𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃), 1 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖)𝐴𝑗 ) , (10) where: 𝑟𝑗,𝑡 (𝜃) = (importance sampling ratio, 𝜋sample 𝑟(𝑥𝑗 ,𝑎𝑗 )𝜇𝑅 𝜎𝑅+𝜖𝑧 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑗,𝑡 𝑥𝑗 ,𝑎𝑗,<𝑡 ) 𝜋sample(𝑎𝑗,𝑡 𝑥𝑗 ,𝑎𝑗,<𝑡 ) is the reference policy), 𝐴𝑗 = (normalized advantage, 𝜇𝑅/𝜎𝑅 are the mean/std of rewards in the rollout group, 𝜖𝑧 = 108 for stability), 𝜖 = 0.2. The policy parameters 𝜃 are updated by minimizing ℒtotal(𝜃) using the Adam optimizer with 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999, and learning rate 𝜂 = 2 106. Training checkpointing is performed every 10 steps to preserve intermediate model states."

This demonstrates the effectiveness of our post-training strategy in enhancing reasoning performance within complex, contextsensitive mental-health tasks. Across every dataset, Mindora𝐶𝐻 𝑂𝑅𝐷 outperform the backbone model Qwen3-8B, showing consistent gains in both accuracy and reasoning quality. Furthermore, Mindora𝐶𝐻 𝑂𝑅𝐷 also exceeds the separately trained Mindora𝑆𝐹 𝑇 and Mindora𝑆𝐹 𝑇 +𝑅𝐿 variants, confirming that the joint SFTRL training paradigm more effectively balances imitation and exploration, avoiding overfitting while improving generalization to unseen cases. Performance analysis across the five task categories reveals that MindoraCHORD demonstrates strong appraisal and diagnostic reasoning, showing improved recognition of subtle cognitive patterns and accurate differentiation of overlapping symptom presentations. It also achieves notable gains in intervention and abstraction tasks, reflecting enhanced multi-stage reasoning and evidence synthesis. The models consistent results in verification tasks further suggest reliable factual grounding and resistance to misinformation. We also observe several interesting phenomena. Among opensource LLMs, different versions of the same model (e.g., DSDistillQwen3-32B, Qwen3-32B, and QwQ-32B) show only minor differences in overall reasoning performance, regardless of whether they 5Qwen-plus is Qwens versatile chat model, also trained with reasoning capabilities. 6https://www.modelscope.cn/models/aJupyter/EmoLLM_Qwen2-7B-Instruct_lora/. 7https://huggingface.co/MindIntLab/Psyche-R1 Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Mengxi Xiao et al. are distilled, chat, or reasoning variants. This suggests that mentalhealth reasoning tasks demand specialized reasoning abilities that general-purpose post-training cannot fully capture, underscoring the need for targeted reasoning optimization for mental health scenarios. Moreover, we find that open-source models ranging from 14B to 70B parameters achieve similar average scores around 0.6, while 8B-scale models remain near 0.55. In contrast, our Mindora series and the baseline Psyche-R1, both specifically optimized for mental-health reasoning, exceed the average performance of 8B models, demonstrating the strong potential of targeted post-training in this domain."

Reasoning Conciseness. The reasoning chain should contain no unnecessary complexity, repetition, or backtracking. Error indicators include: Over-elaborating straightforward case (e.g., exhaustively evaluating all options when the answer is obvious). Repeating the same evidence or argument across multiple steps. Reversing earlier conclusions without justification. Logical Coherence. Each step should provide clear and case-specific reasoning, not merely labels or unsupported claims. Error indicators include: Steps that function only as headings without substantive elaboration. MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Claims presented without corresponding explanations or evidence. Hallucination Avoidance. The reasoning chain should accurately reflect the case information and avoid hallucinations. Error indicators include Introducing facts not mentioned in the case. Task Understanding. The reasoning chain should correctly follow the task objective and not drift to different task. The models reply shouldnt address different task than instructed. For example, if model misunderstands the counseling strategy formulation task, it may generate counselor utterances instead of selecting an appropriate counseling strategy. Internal Consistency. The reasoning chain should exhibit no contradictions across steps. Error indicators include: Later steps contradict earlier interpretations of symptoms, diagnoses, or risk levels. Changing conclusions mid-chain without reconciling prior evidence. Case Study The detail of case study is illustrated in Figure 3. Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Mengxi Xiao et al. Figure 3: challenging case of cognitive error identification."
