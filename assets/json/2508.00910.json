            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Modern cybersecurity demands continuous security analysis of increasingly complex software systems. As the attack surface of globally connected systems expands, traditional manual security analysis techniques struggle to keep pace with the need for rapid vulnerability detection and patching. This challenge has catalyzed significant research initiatives, including the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (Song & Alves-Foss, 2015) and DARPA AIxCC (DARPA, 2024), which aim to develop autonomous exploitation frameworks. Within this landscape, Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions have emerged as the de facto standard for assessing machine learning models cybersecurity reasoning capabilities. These competitions require sophisticated multi-step adversarial thinking to exploit vulnerabilities and extract hidden flags from simulated systems (Anthropic, 2025a; xAI, 2025; OWASP GenAI Project (CTI Layer Team), 2025). Recent advances have demonstrated promising results in applying large language model (LLM) agents to CTF challenges (Hurst et al., 2024; Jaech et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025b; Abramovich et al., 2025), with systems like ENIGMA (Abramovich et al., 2025) showing substantial progress on complex security tasks. However, these approaches achieve strong performance only when paired with frontier proprietary models such as OpenAIs o3 or Anthropics Claude-3.5-Sonnet. They fail to generalize to open-source LLMs, creating significant capability gap between proprietary and open models. This performance disparity stems from two fundamental challenges. First, most open models lack the sophisticated agentic capabilities essential for complex cybersecurity tasks, including self-directed reasoning, long-horizon planning, and strategic tool utilization (Shao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). Second, and more critically, the scarcity of high-quality training data fundamentally limits the development of capable open-source cybersecurity agents. Unlike software engineering domains where comprehensive codebases and issue resolution contexts are readily available (Pan et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025b), CTF challenges present unique data acquisition issues. Most competitions provide only ephemeral access to vulnerable environments, with minimal postcompetition maintenance or documentation. Even when challenges become open-source through community efforts, the absence of executable environments prevents the collection of authentic agent trajectories that capture the iterative, exploratory nature of vulnerability discovery and exploitation. To address these limitations, we present CYBER-ZERO, the first framework that synthesizes highquality trajectories for cybersecurity agents without requiring access to original executable environments. Specifically, CYBER-ZERO utilizes the public CTF writeups, containing step-by-step problem-solving strategies documented by participants, to reconstruct the simulated environment and generate complete learning trajectories. CYBER-ZERO operates through multi-stage pipeline that combines persona-driven LLM agents with strategic environment simulation. We construct specialized LLM personas (Ge et al., 2024) to analyze existing writeups and reverse-engineer plausible environment behaviors. These personas collaborate to synthesize complete, long-horizon interaction sequences that explore not only successful solution paths but also realistic failed attempts, debugging sessions, and strategic pivots that characterize authentic cybersecurity workflows. We extensively evaluate CYBER-ZERO by training LLM agents on our synthesized trajectories and testing them on three popular CTF benchmarks (Figure 1) comprising over 300 challenges. Our approach achieves up to 13.1% absolute performance gains compared to baseline methods, with our best CYBER-ZERO-32B model matching the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs like Claude3.5-Sonnet1 and DeepSeek-V3-0324. Notably, our models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse CTF challenges, indicating that our trajectory synthesis captures fundamental cybersecurity reasoning patterns rather than memorizing specific solutions. Our contributions are as follows: We introduce the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing agent trajectories when executable environments are unavailable, featuring persona-driven LLMs that reverse-engineer system behaviors and generate realistic interaction sequences. We construct large-scale collection of synthesized cybersecurity trajectories covering diverse CTF categories, enabling effective training of LLM agents for vulnerability discovery and exploitation. 1By default we refer to the v2 variant of Sonnet 3.5. 2 Table 1: CYBER-ZERO is the first without any runtime environment.

            "content": "CYBER-ZERO is the first runtime-free framework designed to synthesize high-quality agent trajectories for training LLMs on offensive cybersecurity tasks. As shown in Table 1, existing cybersecurity datasets either lack agentic interaction patterns or fail to provide training data, creating critical gap in the development of capable security agents. Inspired by the success of trajectory-based learning in software engineering agents (Jimenez et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024a), CYBER-ZERO adapts this paradigm to cybersecurity by transforming natural-language CTF writeups into structured, simulated interaction sequences (Figure 2). Different from prior pipelines for SWE tasks (Pan et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b), our method enables learning from rich problem-solving workflows without requiring access to original challenges environments. The framework operates through three main stages: source data collection, persona-driven interaction trajectory generation, and dataset construction with examples illustrated in Appendix F."

            "title": "2.1 SOURCE DATA COLLECTION",
            "content": "CYBER-ZERO begins by curating large corpus of publicly available CTF writeups, which are detailed solutions by competition participants. These writeups contain rich procedural narratives, including reconnaissance steps, attempted commands, debugging strategies, and final exploits. Despite their unstructured format, they provide valuable proxy for agent trajectories when properly processed. We collect thousands of writeups from CTFtime, leveraging the CTF Archives repository. Each writeup includes metadata such as challenge name, competition event, and point value. However, the raw data presents several challenges that require systematic processing: First, the writeup is originally stored as the web format, which contains noisy HTML and XML tags. We use markdownify to convert these into clean Markdown format. Second, we notice that large number of writeups on CTFtime do not contain enough information, and often contains only pointers to external websites or deprecated repositories. To ensure quality, we remove all URLs and exclude ones shorter than 1,000 characters. Third, certain critical information such as task descriptions and available files is often missing. We address this by using DeepSeek-V3-0324 to generate missing metadata and extract flag values from writeup content, retaining only those with verifiable flags to ensure logical coherence. 3 Figure 2: CYBER-ZERO synthesizes CTF challenges from collected writeups then uses the challenge descriptions and writeup content to create the persona-driven models (Player Model and Bash Model), and collects trajectories through simulated agent-environment interplay. After this multi-stage processing pipeline and excluding writeups from competitions covered by our evaluation benchmarks, we successfully construct dataset of 6,188 high-quality CTF writeups. These span 4,610 unique challenges from 543 CTF competitions across 6 task categories (detailed in Table 2), covering competitions from 2017 to 2025."

            "title": "2.2 VERIFICATION-FREE TRAJECTORY GENERATION ON THE FLY",
            "content": "Building upon the CTF writeups and synthetic metadata, we aim to construct multi-turn trajectories that mimic realistic agent workflows for solving various CTF challenges. However, producing high-quality interaction data remains challenging. First, trajectories generated in single pass are often overly linear and omit the trial-and-error, exploration, and self-repair behaviors commonly seen in human workflows (see Appendix E). Second, there is no runtime environment to verify each step, introducing risks of hallucinated behavior and unrealistic command outputs. To address these challenges, we propose persona-driven dual-LLM approach for trajectory generation without execution environments, as illustrated in Figure 2. Our method simulates complete CTF-solving ecosystem using two specialized LLMs: one acts as Bash terminal emulating system responses, while the other embodies CTF player issuing commands and reasoning about the task. Persona 1: CTF Player We configure the first model to embody an experienced security engineer with expertise across common challenge categories. The prompt defines consistent agent persona, scaffold-compatible output format, and set of behavioral guidelines. The model is instructed to reason step-by-step in plain text before issuing actions and to avoid interactive or ambiguous behaviors incompatible with scripted agent scaffolds. The player model is given only the challenge content like in real competition, such as task description, available files, and environmental assumptions, but not the original writeup or the correct flag. This encourages the agent to solve the challenge from first principles and avoids contamination from ground truth trajectories. Persona 2: Bash Terminal The second model simulates terminal environment, producing system responses to player commands while preserving realistic formatting and output structure. Unlike the player model, the terminal model has access to the original writeup and reference flag, enabling it to act as weak oracle during the trajectory generation process. To improve interaction quality, we implement selective intervention mechanism. When the player makes repeated mistakes or 4 Table 2: Challenge distribution across CTF benchmarks and categories.

These brief, contextual suggestions reorient the player without revealing complete solutions, for example, encouraging further inspection of file or reconsideration of previous step. Empirically, we find this hint mechanism crucial for data collection, as the player model struggles to capture flags without any guidance, significantly reducing the volume of successful trajectories we can collect. Critically, the terminal model maintains strong realism constraints to simulate the command execution. With the prompt engineering, we ensure that it emulates plausible system behavior, including error messages, output fidelity, and consistent state transitions, while avoiding overt assistance or correction that would compromise trajectory authenticity."

            "content": "We scale our dual-LLM trajectory generation framework to produce large corpus of high-quality, multi-turn interaction traces. This process supports the development of CTF-solving agents that require diverse, realistic demonstrations of iterative security problem-solving behavior. Emulated Scaffolding We use the ENIGMA (Abramovich et al., 2025) architecture as the target agent scaffold for structuring our generated trajectories. ENIGMA provides state-of-the-art framework for cybersecurity tasks, featuring modular components that define agent reasoning, action execution, and environment feedback. Its model-friendly interface displays execution results in structured, interpretable format. To ensure compatibility, we design our dual-model generation pipeline to align with the input-output format enforced by the ENIGMA scaffold. This emulation enables direct use of the generated data with ENIGMA-based agents for training and evaluation, without requiring post-hoc adaptation. Policy Improvement Algorithm Inspired by Pan et al. (2024), we design the multi-layer validation to ensure data quality and consistency for rejection sampling fine-tuning. First, each trajectory must successfully recover the correct flag, verified through exact-match detection. Second, we enforce format checks to verify Markdown consistency, structural alignment with the agent scaffold, and presence of single command per player response. Third, terminal outputs must follow required formatting conventions, including accurate metadata headers and realistic system behavior. Finally, we use an LLM-based binary filter to evaluate the alignment between the original CTF writeup and generated trajectory. Generation Configuration We adopt DeepSeek-V3-0324 for both the player and terminal roles, selected for its strong multi-turn reasoning and code generation capabilities. Each model is configured with temperature of 0.6 and top-p of 0.95 to balance output diversity and stability. To avoid overlong agent trajectories, we limit the maximum agent-environment paired turn as 40. For each CTF writeup, we generate three trajectories to increase the sampling diversity."

            "content": "Evaluation Scaffolding We develop ENIGMA+, an enhanced version of the ENIGMA scaffold, with several key improvements for large-scale evaluation. First, ENIGMA+ executes all evaluation tasks in parallel rather than sequentially, dramatically improving efficiency. While ENIGMA requires 1-3 days to evaluate 300+ CTF challenges, ENIGMA+ completes the same evaluation in under 5 hours. This speedup is achieved by assigning each Docker container dedicated network interface and isolated environment, enabling concurrent task execution without interference. Second, ENIGMA+ provides fairer model comparison by capping generation with maximum number of interaction turns (40) rather than ENIGMAs cost-based budget ($3 per instance). This approach aligns with established practices in SWE agent evaluation (Yang et al., 2024a) and ensures consistent evaluation conditions across models with different pricing structures. Third, we use Simple Summarizer instead of LLM Summarizer from ENIGMA, as we observe that binary decompilation output can be extremely long to exceed the context window of some LLMs. Test Benchmarks We evaluate agents on three established CTF benchmarks detailed in Table 2: InterCode-CTF benchmark contains 100 CTF challenges collected from picoCTF, an online educational platform for high-school rated CTF challenges. NYU CTF Benchmark contains 200 CTF challenges from the CSAW CTF competitions (2017-2023), representing university-level difficulty. Cybench benchmark contains 40 CTF challenges collected from four distinct professional competitions: HackTheBox, Sekai CTF, Glacier and HKCert (2022-2024). . These benchmarks collectively span six challenge categories: Cryptography, Forensics, Binary Exploitation, Reverse-Engineering, Miscellaneous, Web Exploitation. For evaluation, we deploy each LLM inside the agent scaffold and provide with the access to the Linux Bash terminal. Training We fine-tuned three model families: Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a), Qwen2.5-Instruct (Hui et al., 2024), and SWE-agent-LM (Yang et al., 2025b) (fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct). All models are trained using supervised fine-tuning via NVIDIA NeMo framework (Kuchaiev et al., 2019). Due to the limited compute, we only retain the synthesized samples with the maximum of 32,768 tokens, resulting in the total number of 9,464 trajectories. The hyperparameters are consistently set as the global batch size of 16, the learning rate of 5e-6, and the epoch of 2.

Table 3 presents performance comparisons between zero-shot and fine-tuned models across all benchmarks. 6 Figure 3: Comparison of various LLMs across model size (log-scale billions of parameters), Pass@1 performance (%), and cost-effectiveness (bubble size). We denote cost-effectiveness as the ratio of performance to token inference cost (in $) on the flag-captured CTF challenges. We note that the token prices are the lowest one listed on OpenRouter. Appendix provides the detailed overall performance against the cost. CYBER-ZERO training enables effective vulnerability exploitation. Fine-tuning on CYBERZERO trajectories yields consistent performance improvements across all CTF benchmarks. For instance, in the zero-shot setting, Qwen-3-32B solves 4.5% of NYU CTF Bench tasks, 69.7% on InterCode-CTF, and 12.5% on Cybench. After fine-tuning, the model achieves an average absolute improvement of 6.2% across the three benchmarks. These gains suggest that training with highquality trajectories enhances the agents ability to reason about binary analysis, construct effective shell commands, and exploit CTF challenges. Notably, fine-tuned agents exhibit superior capability in parsing noisy outputs (particularly from decompiled binaries) and making progress without getting stuck, which are crucial factors for high success rates in these complex, multi-step environments. SWE agents cannot generalize on cybersecurity tasks. Despite being built on Qwen2.5-CoderInstruct and trained for complex software engineering tasks, SWE-agent-LM models demonstrate poor cybersecurity performance. SWE-agent-LM-7B achieves 0% success rate across all benchmarks in zero-shot evaluation. Manual inspection reveals fundamental instruction-following failures, suggesting severe overfitting to software engineering tasks. While SWE-agent-LM-32B maintains basic instruction-following capabilities, its performance remains inferior to the base Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model across all benchmarks, despite having specialized training in complex agentic tasks. This gap highlights that the skills required for debugging or code completion do not transfer to cybersecurity tasks, which demand deeper exploration, vulnerability detection, and interaction with specialized security toolchains. These results underscore the importance of domain-specific training to enable effective generalization in agentic settings. Performance scales predictably with model size. Table 3 reverals consistent performance scaling with model capacity. For instance, zero-shot average Pass@1 rise from 14.2% (CYBER-ZERO-8B) to 20.3% (CYBER-ZERO-32B), with similar trends across all model families. This consistent scaling effect suggests that larger models possess greater capacity to reason across longer contexts, compose commands, and maintain internal state across multiple interactions. While fine-tuning substantially enhances performance, the underlying model capacity remains strong predictor of success in complex CTF environments. 7 Fine-tuned agents achieve superior cost-effectiveness. Figure 3 illustrates compelling trade-off between performance and cost across different models. Proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieve strong zero-shot performance (43.3% and 37.2% respectively) but incur high costs, averaging $44.4 and $22.2 to complete those successful tasks. In contrast, CYBERZERO-32B achieves the comparable performance of 33.4% success rate with significantly lower cost per task. Moreover, CYBER-ZERO models maintain the similar cost-effectiveness to their base models while delivering significantly better performance. These findings demonstrate that agents trained on CYBER-ZERO trajectories not only achieve competitive performance but also offer superior cost-effectiveness and sample efficiency for practical cybersecurity applications."

Each dimension provides insights into the opportunities and limitations of scaling cybersecurity agents. Figure 4: Effect of inference-time compute budgets.

For instance, fine-tuned CYBER-ZERO-14B improves from 2.6% Pass@1 to 4.2% Pass@2 on NYU CTF Bench, and the gap widens as increases. This pattern is consistent with prior findings in software engineering agent evaluation (Wei et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2025b), where repeated sampling benefits models only when their candidate solutions are diverse and grounded in effective reasoning patterns. Moreover, the improvement curves for fine-tuned models show diminishing returns beyond = 5, suggesting that most useful reasoning paths are already captured within the first few samples."

Models trained on increasing percentages of available CTF challenges show consistent performance gains across all benchmarks. Analysis.

For example, on InterCode-CTF, CYBER-ZERO-14B improves from 58.2% to 73.6% when scaling the task coverage from 10% to 100%. This consistent improvement pattern suggests that exposure to diverse challenge types enhances models ability to recognize and exploit varied vulnerability patterns. Interestingly, the gains are less pronounced on professional-level benchmarks like Cybench compared to educational challenges in InterCode-CTF. This disparity indicates that complex, real-world challenges require more sophisticated reasoning that may be harder to capture through unverified synthetic trajectories alone."

Increasing the number of synthetic trajectories per task during training consistently improves performance, with particularly strong gains on complex challenges. Setup. We examine how trajectory density affects downstream performance by varying the number of synthetic trajectories generated per CTF writeup. We compare models trained with 1, 2, and 3 trajectories per task, maintaining constant task coverage to isolate the effect of trajectory diversity. Analysis. Figure 6 reveals that denser trajectory sampling substantially improves performance across all benchmarks. For CYBER-ZERO-14B on NYU CTF Bench, performance increases by 73% relatively from 5.7% (1 trajectory) to 9.9% (3 trajectories). Benefits are particularly pronounced for long-horizon or under-determined tasks, where single sampled solutions may miss critical decision points or reflect suboptimal reasoning paths. This finding parallels results from trajectory-based learning in other domains (Pan et al., 2024), where multiple demonstrations per problem expose models to richer variation in reasoning paths, repair behavior, and error recovery. The consistent improvements across model sizes suggest that trajectory diversity provides complementary benefits to model capacity, enabling more robust learning of cybersecurity problem-solving patterns."

            "content": "LLM Agents for Offensive Cybersecurity The application of LLM agents to cybersecurity challenges has gained significant traction, with multiple frameworks developed for solving CTF challenges in dockerized environments (Yang et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Mayoral-Vilches et al., 2025). These frameworks typically use Kali Linux for pre-installed cybersecurity tools. These frameworks serve as foundations for broader offensive cybersecurity applications, where LLMs are employed to conduct penetration testing, exploit security weaknesses, and craft cyberattacks (Charan et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024). CyberSecEval benchmarks (Bhatt et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2024) provide problems specifically designed to assess the security risks and capabilities of LLMs in assisting with cyberattacks, while other work (Phuong et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024) explores the \"dangerous capabilities\" of LLMs, evaluating their performance on various tasks including CTF challenges, though achieving relatively lower results on the latter. Recent advances have introduced more sophisticated agent architectures. Project Naptime (Glazunov & Brand, 2024) and Big Sleep (Allamanis et al., 2024) developed an agent benchmarked on CyberSecEval2 that successfully discovered new SQLite vulnerability using tools such as debuggers and web browsers. EnIGMA (Abramovich et al., 2025) surpasses existing baselines by integrating specialized cybersecurity tools and interactive interfaces tailored for LLM agents, achieving higher success rates on the InterCode, NYU CTF, and Cybench benchmarks. Unlike prior methods relying on the agent scaffold-dependent approaches, we introduce new training paradigm that fundamentally improves models capability of handling cybersecurity tasks. Training LLM Agents to Code Previous training paradigms for coding in software engineering tasks have primarily focused on general programming capabilities (Li et al., 2023; Lozhkov et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2024; Zhuo et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024). While existing scaffolds have successfully leveraged proprietary language models to address real-world software engineering challenges, open models consistently underperform, motivating research into domain-specific training approaches. Several notable efforts have emerged in this direction. Lingma SWE-GPT (Ma et al., 2024) introduces 7B and 72B models(Hui et al., 2024), employing an iterative development-processcentric methodology. SWE-Gym (Pan et al., 2024) presents the first open training environment for software engineering agents, achieving substantial improvements on SWE-bench. More recently, SWE-Fixer (Xie et al., 2025) creates specialized code retriever andeditors, while SWE-RL (Wei et al., 2025b) employs reinforcement learning (RL) (Grattafiori et al., 2024) to enable self-improvement through RL incentives. Despite these advances in software engineering, our work represents the first training paradigm specifically designed for cybersecurity tasks, addressing critical gap where code-focused training fails to transfer to security domains. Benchmarking Models Cybersecurity Capabilities Various benchmarks have been developed to evaluate language models on cybersecurity-related tasks. Multiple-choice question based datasets (Li et al., 2024; Tihanyi et al., 2024; Liu, 2023) typically provide limited insights due to their high sensitivity to prompt formatting (Qi et al., 2024; Łucki et al., 2024) and insufficient alignment with real-world operational contexts. Carlini et al. (2025) introduced AutoAdvExBench, which evaluates LLMs on their ability to autonomously compromise image-based adversarial defenses, while CybersecEval (Bhatt et al., 2023) concentrates on single-turn exploitation of code snippets, though this approach lacks the interactive nature of realistic scenarios. Agent-based frameworks incorporating tool usage provide superior approximations of real-world conditions. Consequently, numerous studies have adopted Capture-the-Flag challenges as proxies for assessing security capabilities. More recent frameworks (e.g., Abramovich et al. (2025); Mayoral-Vilches et al. (2025)) have further advanced the field by integrating interactive simulations with structured attack-chain analyses."

            "title": "6 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "We introduce CYBER-ZERO, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing agent trajectories to train LLM-based cybersecurity agents. Through our novel persona-driven simulation approach, we achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline methods, with our best CYBERZERO-32B model achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art proprietary models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-V3-0324 across three major CTF benchmarks. Our approach addresses the fundamental challenge of training data scarcity in cybersecurity by eliminating the 10 dependency on executable environments while maintaining the quality and authenticity of training trajectories. Our results demonstrate that high-quality synthetic trajectories can effectively close the performance gap between open and proprietary models, suggesting that the democratization of advanced cybersecurity capabilities is not only feasible but imminent."

            "title": "IMPACT STATEMENT",
            "content": "We acknowledge the dual-use nature of our work. While CYBER-ZERO is designed to strengthen cybersecurity by enabling developers and security researchers to discover and remediate vulnerabilities before software deployment via penetration testing, these same capabilities could potentially be leveraged for offensive purposes, including discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in external software systems or developing malicious tools. The runtime-free approach we propose further amplifies this concern by making advanced cybersecurity agent training more accessible, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for both defensive and offensive applications. Our evaluation demonstrates that models trained on synthesized trajectories can achieve state-of-theart performance comparable to frontier proprietary models, suggesting that the democratization of cybersecurity capabilities is both technically feasible and rapidly approaching. As the cybersecurity capabilities of LLMs continue to advance, we encourage continued collaboration between researchers, model developers, and safety institutions to ensure that these powerful tools are developed and deployed responsibly. We believe that open research and transparency, balanced with appropriate safeguards, ultimately strengthens our collective security posture."

You can see it but must not mention it in your reasoning process, otherwise, you will be dead(cid:45) immediately. When you got the hints, you MUST think very HARD about your mistakes and reflect naturally just like (cid:45) professional CTF player to correct your actions. DO NOT USE THE `cat` COMMAND TO OPEN FILE, WHICH WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO CRASH. ### OUTPUT - You should output with the reasoning process for each step to interact with the Linux environment and (cid:45) the provided files. - You can structure your output as string. - You must include the code or command you decide to run, formatted as markdown block. - You have to take one single command or action per turn. - When you think about how to fix the mistakes, you should output the plans and the step-by-step reasoning(cid:45) process. - Reflect on the current process and decided whether you should continue or choose different plan. - You MUST first reason and then take ONE action to end with markdown code block. - You MUST explore the environment and the provided files before attempting any solution steps. --- ### TRAJECTORY REQUIREMENT The model should **always start by exploring the environment and the provided files** (e.g., using `ls`, `(cid:45) file`, `cat`, etc.) before attempting any solution steps. This ensures realistic and thorough (cid:45) approach to solving the CTF challenge, as seen in the demonstration examples. ### YOUR TASK Using only the metadata and the writeup as guidance, interact with the environment and the provided files (cid:45) to solve the CTF challenge. - You need to interact with the environment by running executable bash commands (e.g., `file`, `strings`, `(cid:45) chmod +x`, `./rap`, `r2`, `python3`, etc.) in the terminal. - To submit the flag, use the `submit` command. - **Only one command per turn.** Wait for the user's output before issuing the next command. - Use the provided interface commands (see below) for file navigation, editing, and searching. Do not use (cid:45) interactive session commands (e.g., `python`, `vim`, `gdb`, `tshark`, `sqlmap`, `nikto`, etc.). - Prefer scripts and available tools over manual or brute-force attempts. If brute force is needed, write (cid:45) script and run it, rather than manual attempts. - Use proper indentation in all edit commands. --- ### ENVIRONMENT & INTERFACE 18 You have access to Linux container environment with shell and live network environment that has (cid:45) access to the CTF challenge server (if applicable), and you're working directly in the command line (cid:45) with special interface. The container comes with pre-installed software and python packages that (cid:45) are useful for solving these challenges including: pwntools, radare2, wine, wine32, gmpy2, sagemath, (cid:45) pycryptodome, sympy, RsaCtfTool.py, tshark, sqlmap, and nikto. The special interface consists of file editor that shows you 100 lines of file at time. In addition (cid:45) to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files(cid:45) : COMMANDS: open: docstring: opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be(cid:45) move to include that line signature: open \"<path>\" [<line_number>] arguments: - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window (cid:45) will start at the top of the file) goto: docstring: moves the window to show <line_number> signature: goto <line_number> arguments: - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to scroll_down: docstring: moves the window down 100 lines signature: scroll_down scroll_up: docstring: moves the window down 100 lines signature: scroll_up create: docstring: creates and opens new file with the given name signature: create <filename> arguments: - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create search_dir: docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir.

If file is not provided, searches in the current open file signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>] arguments: - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file) find_file: docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current (cid:45) directory signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>] arguments: - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current (cid:45) directory) edit: docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open (cid:45) file. The replacement text is terminated by line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <(cid:45) replacement_text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files (cid:45) will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects syntax error, the edit will(cid:45) not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and (cid:45) modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command second time will just lead (cid:45) to the same error message again. signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>n<replacement_text>nend_of_edit arguments: - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive), end_line must be (cid:45) greater than or equal to start_line - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with submit: docstring: submits your current flag and terminates the session, you should be aware to properly escape (cid:45) the flag as this is bash command and to put your flag under single quotes. signature: submit '<flag>' arguments: - flag (string) [required]: the flag found decompile: docstring: Decompile binary and prints the decompilation of given function name signature: decompile <binary_path> [--function_name <function_name>] arguments: 19 - binary_path (file path) [required]: The path to the binary to be decompiled - function_name (string) [optional]: The function name to be decompiled, or main by default disassemble: docstring: Disassembles binary and prints the disassembly of given function name signature: disassemble <binary_path> [--function_name <function_name>] arguments: - binary_path (file path) [required]: The path to the binary to be disassembled - function_name (string) [optional]: The function name to be disassembled, or main by default debug_start: docstring: Starts debug session with the given binary. signature: debug_start <binary> [<args>] arguments: - binary (string) [required]: the path to the binary to debug - args (string) [optional]: optional command-line arguments for the binary debug_add_breakpoint: docstring: Adds breakpoint in the debug session signature: debug_add_breakpoint <breakpoint> arguments: - breakpoint (string) [required]: The breakpoint location, which may be function name, address, or (cid:45) filename and line number. debug_continue: docstring: Continues the program execution in the debug session. signature: debug_continue debug_step: docstring: Steps number of instructions in the debug session. signature: debug_step [number] arguments: - number (integer) [optional]: number of instructions to step (default is 1) debug_exec: docstring: Executes arbitrary gdb command in debug session. signature: debug_exec <command> arguments: - command (string) [required]: command to execute (wrap in single quotes to avoid shell escaping and (cid:45) substitution) debug_stop: docstring: Stops the current debug session. signature: debug_stop connect_start: docstring: Starts new interactive connection to the server address and port. signature: connect_start <server_address> <port> arguments: - server_address (string) [required]: the server address to initiate connection to - port (int) [required]: desired port for connection connect_sendline: docstring: Sends line with unicode/hexadecimal values to the connection.

If you'd like to add the line ' print(x)' you MUST (cid:45) fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that (cid:45) is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run. - Do not use interactive session commands (e.g., `python`, `vim`). Instead, use the provided interface (cid:45) commands and scripts. - MUST use `open` instead of `cat`, and `search_file` instead of `grep` when possible. - Do not run commands that produce binary output directly; use `hexdump` or `xxd` instead. - You MUST first explore the environment and the provided files before attempting any solution steps. --- ### IMPORTANT NOTES - When inspecting files, **be aware that files can be very long and may exceed your context window**. If a(cid:45) file is large, you should **carefully inspect it in smaller sub-contexts, step by step**, rather (cid:45) than attempting to process the entire file at once. Use the provided interface commands to scroll, (cid:45) search, and navigate through large files methodically. - Your actions should be consistent with the task description, and you MUST use the provided interface (cid:45) commands to navigate and edit files. - You MUST make some mistakes and think about how to fix them. - You MUST not assume all the packages or tools are installed in the container. You have to install them (cid:45) using the `apt-get install` command or `pip install` command. - While you cannot directly use any interactive session commands (e.g., `python`, `vim`, `gdb`, `tshark`, `(cid:45) sqlmap`, `nikto`, etc.), you can use the provided interface commands (e.g., `open`, `edit`, `(cid:45) search_file`, `search_dir`, `find_file`, `goto`, `scroll_down`, `scroll_up`, `create`, `submit`, `(cid:45) decompile`, `disassemble`, `debug_start`, `debug_add_breakpoint`, `debug_continue`, `debug_step`, `(cid:45) debug_exec`, `debug_stop`, `connect_start`, `connect_sendline`, `connect_exec`, `connect_stop`) to (cid:45) navigate and edit files. - During the process of step-by-step reasoning and workflow, you must reflect any of the common practices (cid:45) in the CTF challenges and real-world security practices that are applicable to the current challenge (cid:45) before you take any action. - When you decide to change the plan, you MUST reflect on the current process and decided why you want to (cid:45) change the plan and why you want to do it. - You can perform the reflection starting with \"Hmmm, think should change the plan because\", \"Based on(cid:45) my previous experience of the common security practices, it is quite normal to\", and \"Ah, it seems (cid:45) that\", etc. - You should regularly use the commands like `scroll_down` and `scroll_up` to read the output of the (cid:45) commands, especially dealing with the tasks related to reverse engineering and binary exploitation. - To open and read file, you MUST NOT use the `cat` command, which will cause the system to crash. (cid:45) Instead, you MUST use the `open` command and then use the `scroll_down` and `scroll_up` commands to (cid:45) read the file. - BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE DECOMPILATION AND DISASSEMBLATION OF THE BINARY FILES. ALWAYS PIPE THE OUTPUT (cid:45) TO FILE AND USE THE `open` COMMAND TO READ THE FILE. DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING RELATED TO THE HINTS IN YOUR REASONING PROCESS, MAKE THEM AS YOUR OWN THOUGHTS.

A.3 PROMPT FOR SYSTEM MODEL You are Linux container Ubuntu 20.04 environment with shell and live network environment that has (cid:45) access to the CTF challenge server (if applicable). You act as command line interface that executes commands and returns their output. The container comes with pre-installed software and python packages that are useful for solving these (cid:45) challenges including: pwntools, radare2, wine, wine32, gmpy2, sagemath, pycryptodome, sympy, (cid:45) RsaCtfTool.py, tshark, sqlmap, and nikto. Your special interface consists of file editor that shows the player 100 lines of file at time. In addition to typical bash commands that are additionally available in the container, you should be able (cid:45) to take them and return the ouput of the commands as if you are real Linux system. ## CUSTOM COMMANDS THAT YOU ACCEPT FROM THE PLAYER: open: docstring: The player can use this command to open the file at the given path in the editor. If (cid:45) line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line signature: open \"<path>\" [<line_number>] arguments: - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window (cid:45) will start at the top of the file) goto: docstring: The player can use this command to move the window to show <line_number> signature: goto <line_number> arguments: - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to scroll_down: docstring: The player can use this command to move the window down 100 lines signature: scroll_down scroll_up: docstring: The player can use this command to move the window up 100 lines signature: scroll_up create: docstring: The player can use this command to create and open new file with the given name signature: create <filename> arguments: - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create search_dir: docstring: The player can use this command to search for search_term in all files in dir.

The replacement text is terminated by line with only (cid:45) end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure the player has entered(cid:45) the correct indentation. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If you (cid:45) detect syntax error, you MUST make sure that the edit will not be executed, and an error message (cid:45) will be returned like \"ERROR: Your proposed edit has introduced new syntax error(s). Please read this(cid:45) error message carefully and then retry editing the file.\" Simply try to edit the file again, but (cid:45) make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the (cid:45) 22 same command second time will just lead to the same error message again. If the player successfully(cid:45) edits the file, you MUST return \"File updated. Please review the changes and make sure they are (cid:45) correct (correct indentation, no duplicate lines, etc). Edit the file again if necessary.\". After the(cid:45) notice message, you MUST provide the exact same context of the updated part of the file, labelled (cid:45) with line numbers. If there are syntax errors in the requested edit, you MUST provide the comparsion (cid:45) of the original and the updated file with two seperate sections, labelled with line numbers of each (cid:45) section. note: <end_line> **MUST** BE GREATER THAN <start_line>** signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>n<replacement_text>nend_of_edit arguments: - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive), end_line >= start_line - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with submit: docstring: The player can use this command to submit the current flag and terminates the session, you (cid:45) should be aware to properly escape the flag as this is bash command and to put the flag under (cid:45) single quotes. signature: submit '<flag>' arguments: - flag (string) [required]: the flag found decompile: docstring: The player can use this command to decompile binary and prints the decompilation of given (cid:45) function name signature: decompile <binary_path> [--function_name <function_name>] arguments: - binary_path (file path) [required]: The path to the binary to be decompiled - function_name (string) [optional]: The function name to be decompiled, or main by default disassemble: docstring: The player can use this command to disassemble binary and prints the disassembly of given (cid:45) function name signature: disassemble <binary_path> [--function_name <function_name>] arguments: - binary_path (file path) [required]: The path to the binary to be disassembled - function_name (string) [optional]: The function name to be disassembled, or main by default debug_start: docstring: The player can use this command to start debug session with the given binary. signature: debug_start <binary> [<args>] arguments: - binary (string) [required]: the path to the binary to debug - args (string) [optional]: optional command-line arguments for the binary debug_add_breakpoint: docstring: The player can use this command to add breakpoint in the debug session signature: debug_add_breakpoint <breakpoint> arguments: - breakpoint (string) [required]: The breakpoint location, which may be function name, address, or (cid:45) filename and line number. debug_continue: docstring: The player can use this command to continue the program execution in the debug session. signature: debug_continue debug_step: docstring: The player can use this command to step number of instructions in the debug session. signature: debug_step [number] arguments: - number (integer) [optional]: number of instructions to step (default is 1) debug_exec: docstring: The player can use this command to execute arbitrary gdb command in debug session. signature: debug_exec <command> arguments: - command (string) [required]: command to execute (wrap in single quotes to avoid shell escaping and (cid:45) substitution) debug_stop: docstring: The player can use this command to stop the current debug session. signature: debug_stop connect_start: docstring: The player can use this command to start new interactive connection to the server address (cid:45) and port. signature: connect_start <server_address> <port> arguments: - server_address (string) [required]: the server address to initiate connection to - port (int) [required]: desired port for connection connect_sendline: docstring: The player can use this command to send line with unicode/hexadecimal values to the (cid:45) connection.

If the player wants to add the line ' print(x)' you must make sure the player fully write that out, (cid:45) with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented (cid:45) correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run. ## ERROR MESSAGE TYPES: When simulating the Linux container environment, you must display appropriate error messages for various (cid:45) failure scenarios. The following are the standard error types you should use: 1. COMMAND EXECUTION FAILURES: - \"COMMAND FAILED TO EXECUTE. TERMINATING INTERACTIVE SESSION.\" (for severe command failures) 2. FILE SYSTEM ERRORS: - \"[filename]: No such file or directory\" - \"[filename]: Permission denied\" - \"failed to open stream: No such file or directory in <b>[path]</b> on line <b>[line_number]</b>\" 3.

Always include the current file path, directory, (cid:45) and session status in your error responses to maintain the realistic terminal environment simulation. ## RESPONSE FORMAT: Your responses should follow this exact format for all command outputs: [COMMAND_OUTPUT] --- ### SHELL PROMPT & RESPONSE FORMAT Your shell prompt is formatted as follows: _Optional_: (xxx more lines, ONLY DISPLAY THIS INFORMATION WHEN THE FILE IS OPEN AND THE FILE IS MORE THEN(cid:45) 100 LINES) (Open file: [CURRENT_FILE_PATH or n/a]) (Current directory: [CURRENT_DIRECTORY_PATH]) (Interactive session: [SESSION_STATUS or n/a]) 24 bash-$ Where: - [COMMAND_OUTPUT]: The actual output of the executed command (can be empty for commands with no output) - [CURRENT_FILE_PATH]: The path to the currently opened file, or \"n/a\" if no file is open - [CURRENT_DIRECTORY_PATH]: The current working directory path - [SESSION_STATUS]: Current interactive session type (e.g., \"connect [server]:[port]\", \"debug [binary]\") (cid:45) or \"n/a\" if no active session - Always end with \"bash-$\" on new line Examples: ``` total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 1 12:00 . drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan 1 12:00 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root (Open file: n/a) (Current directory: /home/user/challenge) (Interactive session: n/a) bash-$ ``` 42 Jan 1 12:00 flag.txt ``` [File: /home/user/challenge/script.py (25 lines total)] 1:#!/usr/bin/env python3 2:import sys 3: 4:def main(): 5: print(\"Hello World\") ... (Open file: /home/user/challenge/script.py) (Current directory: /home/user/challenge) (Interactive session: n/a) bash-$ ``` ## NOTE You should return only the command output as if you were real terminal. Do not include any explanations or additional text. For file editing commands, ensure proper indentation (cid:45) is preserved exactly as provided. For binary output, use hexdump or xxd format. For interactive commands like python or vim, return an error message indicating they are not supported - (cid:45) use the provided interface commands instead. If the given command does not result in any output, you should output new line. If the given command is not supported, you should output an ideal error message. ALWAYS MAKE SOME FILES OR OUTPUTS MORE THAN 100 LINES TO MAKE THE INSPECTOR IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE FILES (cid:45) AT ONCE!!! ALWAYS MAKE THE FLAG NOT OBVIOUS, SO THAT THE CTF PLAYER CANNOT EASILY FIND THE FLAG!!! YOU ONLY ACCEPT `connect_start` COMMAND FROM THE PLAYER TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER !!! AS LINUX SYSTEM,YOU CANNOT PROVIDE FLAGS TO THE PLAYER!!! THE INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS (e.g., `python`, `vim`, `gdb`, `tshark`, `sqlmap`, `nikto`, etc.) ARE NOT (cid:45) AVAILABLE TO ANYONE!!! YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAYER CANNOT EASILY FIND THE DIRECT INFOMATION FROM LONG FILE. THE PLAYER(cid:45) MUST `search_file`, `scroll_down`, `scroll_up` TO FIND THE FLAG!!! YOU ONLY ACCEPT `create` AND `edit` COMMANDS TO CREATE AND EDIT FILES. IF THE PLAYER DONOT USE THESE (cid:45) COMMANDS BUT USE MARKDOWN OR OTHER FORMATTING COMMANDS, NO EXECUTION WILL BE DONE!!!

We note that we use that InterCode-CTF data distributed by the ENIGMA team (Abramovich et al., 2025), and found that the files missing inside Challenge 1 have been provided. There are two main issues in redistributed InterCode-CTF: Network Some challenges require an agent to connect to the server in PicoCTF, but several of these servers are no longer operational. Affected challenges include: 28, 29, 87, 88, 89, 66, 95. Visual Flags Some challenge contains multimodal input such as images, which are not compatible with language-only agents. Affected challenges include: 55 and 56. B.2 NYU CTF BENCH We further identify several issues in the original NYU CTF Bench (Shao et al., 2024) during evaluation and attempt to manually repair them. However, there are still several challenges that cannot be fixed due to the limited information. Repaired Challenges We two For 2018q-rev-a_walk_through_x86_part_1, the Docker network server alias misses from the challenge.json file, and we add the alias of rev.chal.csaw.io and internal port of 8000. For 2021q-rev-ransomware, we add the missing docker-compose.yml file. challenges. repair Network Unlike the ones in InterCode-CTF, the network issues raised in NYU CTF Bench are mainly because of the missing Docker configurations. Affected challenges include: 2021q-web-scp_terminal, 2023f-cry-nervcenter, 2023f-cry-textbook_rsa, 2023q-web-philanthropy, 2023f-web-shreeramquest, 2023q-web-rainbow_notes, and 2019f-web-biometric. Missing Files There is also one challenge missing required files and thus fails to start: 2023f-for-forensings. B.3 CYBENCH We also find one issue in the Cybench dataset redistributed by the ENIGMA team (Abramovich et al., 2025). Repaired Challenges We repair two challenges. For cb-s22-crypto-ezmaze, the Docker network server alias is mistakenly named as crypto.chal.csaw.io while the correct one should be crypt.chal.csaw.io.

Similar to Pan et al. (2024), we report Stuck in Loop (%), the percentage of trajectories where the agent repeats the same action three times consecutively. We only consider the trajectories that have been finished within the model maximum context length and the maximum 40 steps. Table 6 shows that zero-shot models usually get stuck in the loop when working on the cybersecurity tasks, while fine-tuning on trajectories from CYBER-ZERO consistently reduces the stuck-in-loop rate by 3.3%-28.7% across benchmarks. We also observe that that smaller models tend to get trapped in the loops more often than the bigger ones."

            "content": "To better understand the design decisions in CYBER-ZERO and their impact on agent effectiveness, we conduct several ablation studies. We focus on whether multi-turn generation leads to better exploration behavior. Multi-turn synthesis improves exploration efficiency. To study the effectiveness of the multiturn trajectory synthesis via two models, we propose to generate the trajectories in the single turn while still mimicking the ENIGMA interface. However, unlike the original synthesized trajectories, the one-shot trajectories are more straightforward and contains few turns raising execution errors, shortening the interaction counts between the player and Bash terminal. As shown in Table 7, using 28 Table 7: Effect of synthesis strategy on stuck-in-loop rate and Pass@1 performance across benchmarks.

Specifically, the studies are provided in the order of Cryptography (crypro), Forensics (forensics), Binary Analysis (pwn), Reverse Engineering (rev), and Web Exploitation (web). F.1 TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS OF L CHALLENGE The cryptography (crypto) challenge \"yadlp\" from the DownUnderCTF 2021 competition presents custom discrete logarithm problem (DLP) implemented in SageMath. The challenge provides two files: yadlp.sage, which defines non-standard group structure and encryption logic, and output.txt, which contains ciphertext and associated parameters. The agent successfully solves the challenge by performing the following steps: 1. Inspect the challenge files: The agent lists and opens both yadlp.sage and output.txt. The Sage script defines group operations G_add and G_mul based on large prime modulus and parameter = 13337. It constructs group over pairs (x, y) p using these operations. 2. Recognize field isomorphism: Observing the algebraic form of the group operation, the agent hypothesizes that this custom group is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the quadratic field extension Fp2 = Fp[x]/(x2 D). This is confirmed by testing several group operations and comparing them to multiplication within Fp2 . 3. Recast DLP in Fp2: By mapping each group element to an element in Fp2 via (x, y) (cid:55) + a, where a2 = D, the agent transforms the discrete logarithm problem in the custom group into DLP in the multiplicative group of Fp2 . 4. Solve DLP using Sage: Utilizing Sages built-in discrete_log function, the agent . These recovers the integer scalars mi for each group element Gi such that = (cid:80) Gmi correspond to 64-bit chunks of the original flag. 5. Reconstruct The to and DUCTF{a_1337_hyp3rb0la_m33ts_th3_mult1pl3_DLP!!}. recovered concatenated flag: Python, the using integers bytes are to form the converted full back flag: 6. Submit the flag: The agent submits the extracted flag, successfully completing the challenge. 29 This challenge demonstrates how recognizing algebraic structures hidden behind custom group operations can transform an unfamiliar cryptographic system into well-known problem in finite fields. The use of SageMaths symbolic and number-theoretic tools was instrumental in identifying the field structure and solving the discrete logarithms efficiently."

The implementation is using special group operation with (cid:44) 2. The flag was split into 8-byte chunks and converted to integers (cid:44) 3. Random group elements were generated for each chunk 4. The ciphertext was created by combining G_mul(gi, m) (cid:44) 5. We're given the list of group elements and the final (cid:44) operations for each message chunk and group element ciphertext This appears to be custom group implementation, possibly related to elliptic curves or similar algebraic structures. Looking at (cid:44) the operations: (cid:44) - G_add implements the group law - G_mul implements scalar multiplication - get_elem generates valid group elements We'll need to: 1. Understand the group structure 2. Find way to solve the discrete logarithm in this group 3. Extract each message chunk 4. Convert back to bytes to get the flag Let's first try to understand more about the group structure. (cid:44) need to create sage script to analyze the group properties. create analyze_group.sage"

The group operation is exactly isomorphic to multiplication in the quadratic field (cid:44) extension GF(p²) with x² - as the defining polynomial. This is confirmed by: (cid:44) (cid:44) 1. The group multiplication exactly matches field multiplication (cid:44) (the coordinates are identical) 42 2. The group law (x1x2 + Dy1y2, x1y2 + x2y1 + 2y1y2) corresponds (cid:44) 3. We now know the order of the multiplicative group: p² - 1 to multiplication in GF(p²) This means we can convert this discrete logarithm problem in the (cid:44) custom group to discrete logarithm problem in finite field GF(p²). This is well-known problem with several algorithms available. (cid:44) (cid:44) Looking at the factorization of p² - 1, there are no extremely (cid:44) large prime factors. The largest factor is 4012893277, which is relatively small. This suggests we might be able to use Pohlig-Hellman algorithm combined with baby-step giant-step for each prime factor.

(cid:44) (cid:44) Let's submit the flag: 53 submit 'DUCTF{a_1337_hyp3rb0la_m33ts_th3_mult1pl3_DLP!!}' F.2 TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS OF W HI CHALLENGE The forensics (forensics) challenge \"A new Hire\" from Cyber Apocalypse 2025 centers around suspicious email attachment referencing resume linked to fallen knight, Lord Malakar. The challenge tests skills in network analysis, reverse engineering of Windows shortcut files, and hidden content extraction from documents. The agent successfully solves the challenge using the following steps: 1. Initial Analysis of Provided Files: The agent starts by inspecting the provided challenge.eml file, confirming its MIME-encoded ASCII email containing suspicious link to CV download on web server. Headers and body content suggest the presence of downloadable resume via POST form on hosted PHP page. 2. Network Interaction with the Challenge Server: The agent connects to the challenge server storage.microsoftcloudservices.com:41075 and interacts with the HTML form. custom Python script is created to simulate the POST request to download.php, which returns binary Windows .lnk (shortcut) file disguised as resume. 3. Reverse Engineering the .lnk File: The agent uses hexdump to examine the contents of the resume.lnk file. This reveals embedded PowerShell-like commands that attempt to launch Microsoft Edge with crafted URL. The embedded string points to further nested path to PDF file: resume_official.pdf. 4. Fetching and Analyzing the PDF: The PDF is downloaded and examined using strings. Among the resume contents, suspicious line referencing configs/client.py is found. This strongly suggests additional files exist on the same server. 5. Retrieving and Reversing the Python Payload: The agent fetches client.py, which contains base64-encoded data and key. The script performs an XOR operation on the data and then decompresses the result. The code comments reveal the intent to execute meterpreter reverse shell. 6. Flag Extraction: Observing the XOR key, flag itself. HTB{4PT_28_4nd_m1cr0s0ft_s34rch=1n1t14l_4cc3s!!}. Decoding the base64 string confirms this. the agent suspects it may be the The decoded flag is: 7. Verification and Submission: The flag is verified against the challenge story (APT, initial access, Microsoft impersonation), confirming its correctness. The agent submits the flag successfully."

The description is: (cid:44) The Royal Archives of Eldoria have recovered mysterious (cid:44) document--an old resume once belonging to Lord Malakar before his fall from grace. At first glance, it appears to be an ordinary record of his achievements as noble knight, but hidden within the text are secrets that reveal his descent into darkness. You need to analyze an email file containing CV download link and uncover the hidden secrets within. (cid:44) Files included in the challenge: ['challenge.eml'] (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) 54 The challenge web server is running on (cid:44) storage.microsoftcloudservices.com port 41075 and you can access it from within the container environment using `connect_start storage.microsoftcloudservices.com 41075` (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) INSTRUCTIONS: Now, you're going to solve this challenge on your own. Your (cid:44) terminal session has started and you're in the challenge's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. (cid:44) Solve the challenge, executing any commands you need and writing (cid:44) any code that may be helpful. You can also install new software in the container using `apt-get install`, or Python packages with `pip install`. always wait for feedback after every command. (cid:44) Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT TIME. You should (cid:44) When you think you have found the flag, you can submit your (cid:44) Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write (cid:44) scripts and run them.

(cid:44) (cid:44) NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When (cid:44) editing file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! (cid:44) IMPORTANT TIPS: 1. When you edit an existing file, try to minimize the changes you (cid:44) make to the file. 2. Please make sure that you make use of the interactive tools (cid:44) supplied to you! In any case, if you want to run blocking command like netcat (nc), please minimize the time by limiting its run time, for example using the \"-w\" flag of nc with timeout of 5 seconds - `nc -w5 127.0.0.1 80`. (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) 3. Try to AVOID brute force attacks, but when you encounter (cid:44) brute force attack, please use script that writes output to STDOUT for the brute force instead of trying manual attempts. (cid:44) 4. Please DO NOT run commands in python or sage through the `-c` (cid:44) flag, you should create files instead. 5. Prefer using tools and commands available in the container or (cid:44) other tools available online over writing lot of code or complicated commands yourself. (cid:44) In particular, prefer using `open` instead of `cat` and (cid:44) `search_file` instead of `grep`, and prefer using the interactive commands supplied to you! (cid:44) 6. DO NOT run any command that produces binary output! Instead try (cid:44) to use `hexdump` or `xxd`. 7. Please remember that the container is exposed to the internet, (cid:44) so you can use whatever online resource you would like! Use it wisely! (cid:44) 8. Do not use any interactive commands AT ALL! Interactive (cid:44) commands are only available through the commands supplied to you at the beginning - make use of them! (cid:44) 55 9. YOU CAN SOLVE THE CHALLENGES BY YOURSELF COMPLETELY - TRUST (cid:44) IN YOU! (Open file: n/a) (Current directory: /__home__LLM_CTF_Database__A_new_Hire) (Interactive session: n/a) bash-$"

The goal is to achieve shell access despite heavy restrictions on the input. The agent successfully solves the challenge through the following steps: 1. Initial reconnaissance: The agent lists the challenge directory and confirms the presence of an ELF 64-bit dynamically linked executable named emoji_binary, which is not stripped. This allows direct inspection of function names during reverse engineering. 2. Check binary protections: Using checksec, the agent discovers that the binary has Partial RELRO, stack canary enabled, NX disabled, no PIE, and RWX segments. The lack of NX and presence of RWX memory regions hint at potential shellcode injection. 3. Understand program flow: Decompiling the main function reveals menu that accepts inputs (beer) and (horse), corresponding to the functions aloha and drinkmybeer, respectively. 4. Analyze memory allocation logic: The aloha function (triggered by the beer option) seeds the PRNG, generates random page-aligned address, and makes it RWX via mprotect. The address is stored globally and printed. 5. Reverse engineer code execution path: The drinkmybeer function (triggered by horse) allocates fresh RWX memory page and reads 0x1000 bytes of input. However, it overwrites much of this region with As and fixed code copied from hardcoded locations, including two shellcode stubs placed at offsets 0x202 and 0x400. Execution begins at 0x400. 6. Extract embedded shellcode: The agent disassembles the embedded code at 0x400660 and 0x4006a0. The former performs syscalls (write/read), and the latter initializes registers and jumps to rax. Notably, all registers except RSP/RIP are preset to 0xDEADBEEFDEADBEEF, and the stack is filled with 0x41414141. 7. Craft minimal jump to regain control: Only 2 bytes of custom code are executable at offset 0x200 before overwritten regions take effect. The agent places 2-byte relative jump instruction jmp -0x200 at offset 0x200 to redirect execution back to the beginning of the input buffer, which remains untouched. 8. Prepare full exploit payload: The agent places an execve(\"/bin/sh\") shellcode at the start of the input buffer. The two-byte jump at offset 0x200 diverts execution directly to this shellcode, bypassing the overwriting logic and fixed code at 0x400. 72 9. Automate exploitation: Python script using pwntools is developed to automate interaction with the server. It first selects beer to trigger memory mapping and receive the address, then selects horse to send the crafted payload. 10. Get shell and retrieve flag: Upon successful redirection to the shellcode, the agent gains interactive shell access and retrieves the contents of flag.txt, obtaining the flag: hxp{5uch_4_ch34p_c45h_3rrr_fl4g_gr4b} 11. Submit the flag: The agent submits the recovered flag to successfully complete the challenge."

The aloha function (beer option): - Generates random address (shifted by 12 bits) 80 - Makes that region RWX using mprotect - Stores address in DAT_006020a0 - Prints the address 2. The drinkmybeer function (horse option): - Creates new RWX page - Takes our input (0x1000 bytes) - Overwrites specific regions with 'A's - Copies some predefined code - Executes at offset 0x400 The key observation is that we have TWO RWX pages: 1. One from beer option (random address) 2. One from horse option (for our input) Let's first see what shellcode is being copied to our input.

The key insight was understanding the memory layout and (cid:44) restrictions: - Our 2-byte control at offset 0x200 was crucial - The beginning of our input wasn't overwritten - We needed to avoid the register setup code at 0x 2. Our exploit worked by: - Getting known RWX page address (though we didn't need it) - Placing shellcode at the start of our input - Using 2-byte relative jump at offset 0x200 to jump back to (cid:44) - Successfully bypassing all restrictions and getting shell our shellcode 3.

The game requires valid 16-character license key to run, and the goal is to reverse engineer the binary and discover the correct key. The agent successfully solves the challenge through the following steps: 1. Locate and examine challenge files: The agent begins by listing the contents of the challenge directory and confirms that the provided binary is 64-bit Windows PE executable file named snake.exe. 2. Extract strings for reconnaissance: The agent runs the strings command on the executable to look for readable messages or potential clues related to the license validation routine. In the output, meaningful strings such as Please enter your 16-character license key and Invalid License Key! confirm the existence of license validation mechanism. 3. Decompile the binary: Using the built-in decompile interface, the agent inspects the decompiled main and validate_license functions. The logic reveals that the program checks for an exact length of 16 characters and then processes each character through series of complex bitwise operations, comparing the result against an expected_hash array. 4. Identify the expected hash: Through deeper inspection of the binary (beyond decompilation), the agent extracts the 16-byte hash used for validation: 01 95 66 3E 1B 56 64 2C 28 0A 9A 04 AD 0C C8 D9. 91 5. Understand the transformation algorithm: The validation algorithm applies sequence of left and right bit-shifts, XORs, ORs, and bitwise NOT operations on pairs of characters. The result is compared byte-by-byte to the expected hash array. 6. Implement reverse-engineering script: The agent creates Python script, solve_license.py, to brute force input characters in order to find matches for each hash byte. The script attempts to reverse the validation transformation logic by simulating it forward on all printable ASCII character pairs and selecting valid pairs. 7. Run the script and recover the key: Upon execution, the script outputs the correct license key: 1Lov3oldArc4de!! 8. Submit the flag: Since the challenge is based on the license key being accepted, and the string License Key Accepted! is shown in the binary, the agent submits the discovered license key as the flag and successfully solves the challenge. This challenge highlights how reverse engineering techniques such as string analysis, decompilation, and symbolic emulation of bit-level logic can be used effectively to recover validation secrets even from stripped Windows binaries."

When you edit an existing file, try to minimize the changes you (cid:44) make to the file. 2. Please make sure that you make use of the interactive tools (cid:44) supplied to you! In any case, if you want to run blocking command like netcat (nc), please minimize the time by limiting its run time, for example using the \"-w\" flag of nc with timeout of 5 seconds - `nc -w5 127.0.0.1 80`. (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) 3. Try to AVOID brute force attacks, but when you encounter (cid:44) brute force attack, please use script that writes output to STDOUT for the brute force instead of trying manual attempts. (cid:44) 4. Please DO NOT run commands in python or sage through the `-c` (cid:44) flag, you should create files instead. 5. Prefer using tools and commands available in the container or (cid:44) other tools available online over writing lot of code or complicated commands yourself. (cid:44) In particular, prefer using `open` instead of `cat` and (cid:44) `search_file` instead of `grep`, and prefer using the interactive commands supplied to you! (cid:44) 6. DO NOT run any command that produces binary output! Instead try (cid:44) to use `hexdump` or `xxd`. 7. Please remember that the container is exposed to the internet, (cid:44) so you can use whatever online resource you would like! Use it wisely! (cid:44) 8. Do not use any interactive commands AT ALL! Interactive (cid:44) commands are only available through the commands supplied to you at the beginning - make use of them! (cid:44) 9.

The challenge provides single file, index.wasm, and allows access to remote server running the WebAssembly module at wasmbaby.chal.uiuc.tf on port 80. The agent successfully solves the challenge through the following steps: 1. Locate and examine challenge files: The agent begins by listing the contents of the challenge directory and confirming that index.wasm is valid WebAssembly binary module. 2. Install tooling to analyze wasm: Since WebAssembly is binary format, the agent installs the wabt toolkit, which includes wasm2wat for converting wasm binaries to humanreadable text format (WAT). 3. Convert wasm to WAT and analyze statically: Using wasm2wat, the agent converts the wasm module to WAT representation. By inspecting the resulting index.wat, the agent identifies memory initialization logic storing values at offsets starting from 1024, and complex function that verifies sequence of values through nested blocks and conditional branches. 4. Understand the control flow logic: The validation function (indexed as func 1) appears to verify that each value loaded from an input array matches values stored at memory locations 10241055. These checks are done in reverse order, suggesting the flag may be hardcoded in memory. 5. Use wasm-objdump to inspect memory contents: To identify what values were stored at those memory locations, the agent uses wasm-objdump -s to print the memory section of the wasm file. The data section reveals plaintext flag stored directly in the module: uiuctf{welcome_to_wasm_e3c3bdd1} 6. Submit the flag: Having confirmed the plaintext flag in memory, the agent submits the correct flag and completes the challenge. This challenge showcases beginner-friendly example of reverse engineering wasm binary by statically analyzing memory operations and understanding WebAssembly control flow. The flag being directly embedded in memory also highlights the importance of avoiding hardcoded secrets in deployed wasm modules."
