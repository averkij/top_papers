            "title": "1 INTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success\nacross diverse domains, largely due to advanced prompting tech-\nniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [12] , Tree-of-Thought (ToT)\n[15], and Prompt-of-Thought (PoT) [20]. These methods guide mod-\nels to reason step-by-step or explore multiple reasoning paths, sig-\nnificantly enhancing their performance on complex tasks. However,\ntheir effectiveness heavily relies on manually crafted, task-specific\nprompts, which are time-consuming to design and challenging to\nadapt optimally across varied tasks. This dependency on prompt en-\ngineering poses a critical bottleneck, where generic prompts often\nfail to elicit robust reasoning.",
            "content": "To address this challenge, we propose Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), novel training framework that embeds diverse set of reasoning strategies directly into LLMs, enabling them to autonomously select and apply effective reasoning methods tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches [3, 19] that rely on external prompt engineering to elicit reasoning, MoR internalizes reasoning capabilities by fine-tuning models on curated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset enriched with reasoning chain templates. These templates, generated by leveraging the advanced reasoning abilities of closed-source large models (e.g., GPT-4o), cover wide range of reasoning patterns, including multi-step deduction, analogical reasoning, and strategic thinking. The MoR framework operates in two key phases: (1) Thought Generation, where we produce largescale reasoning chain templates (e.g., 50, 150, 300, and 500 chains) to capture diverse problem-solving approaches, and (2) SFT Dataset Construction, where we pair these templates with samples from benchmark datasets to create training dataset that teaches models to adaptively apply reasoning strategies. By embedding these strategies into the models parameters, MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompt design and enhances generalizability across complex reasoning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that MoR significantly outperforms baseline models, with our best model, 𝑀𝑜𝑅150, achieving performance of 0.730 with CoT prompting (a 2.2% improvement over the baseline) and 0.734 with direct IO prompting (a 13.5% improvement), showcasing its ability to reason effectively without explicit guidance. Our contributions are as follows: ICMR 25, June 30July 3, 2025, Chicago, IL, USA. Tao Xiong, Xavier Hu, Wenyan Fan and Shengyu Zhang We introduce MoR, training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs, enabling task-adaptive reasoning without reliance on specific prompts. We propose two-step methodology involving Thought Generation and SFT Dataset Construction, leveraging large-scale reasoning templates and curated datasets. We provide comprehensive experimental evidence demonstrating MoRs superiority over baseline models, with detailed analyses and case studies illustrating its logical reasoning capabilities."

            "content": "Prompt Engineering. Thoughtful prompt design can enhance the reasoning abilities of large models, helping them tackle complex challenges. Chain-of-thought prompting is strategy that guides large language models (LLMs) to produce intermediate reasoning steps, ultimately leading to the final answer and improving problem-solving accuracy. Typical implementations include zeroshot CoT [6] and few-shot CoT [12]. Recent studies [11, 13, 16, 18] have further advanced this method by integrating more structured algorithms and search strategies. For example, Zheng et al. [18] enables LLMs to abstract high-level concepts and first principles from detailed instances, while Yasunaga et al. [16] prompts models to generate relevant examples or contextual knowledge before solving the problem. Additionally, some research [3, 19] is also exploring the use of different types of reasoning chains tailored to various task categories. Our approach, MoR, differs from these methods in that it not only produces diverse array of reasoning strategies but also employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train foundational model capable of multi-chain reasoning."

The models fine-tuned on different numbers of X-chain of thought datasets are used as our comparison models, denoted as 𝑀𝑜𝑅𝑖, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑖 = 50, 150, 300, 500.

            "content": "For simple tasks like HotpotQA, most models perform well, with some achieving perfect scores, indicating that basic models are already effective for direct question-answering. However, for complex tasks like StrategyQA and MMLU, MoR models using Chain-ofThought (CoT) prompts show superior performance, highlighting the importance of structured reasoning chains for complex tasks. The experiments reveal that increasing reasoning templates doesnt always improve performance, especially with limited training data. The 𝑀𝑜𝑅150 configuration achieved the optimal chain-of-thought stimulation, and as MoRs chain-of-thought and data grow, explicit guidance may be less necessary, with the IO prompt effectively stimulating reasoning in 𝑀𝑜𝑅500, achieving best result of 0.734. The MoR approach outperforms traditional methods, particularly in multi-step inference and strategy-oriented tasks. While CoT and IO prompts perform similarly, the IO prompt provides slight advantage in some tasks, showcasing task-specific benefits. These results confirm that integrating MoR training with tailored prompts enhances reasoning abilities, advancing AI in complex problemsolving. To verify these results, we expanded the test set for both the baseline model and 𝑀𝑜𝑅150 to 200 samples. As shown in Table X, the extended 𝑀𝑜𝑅150 maintains consistent advantage over the baseline. Case study of MoR methods. In Figure 2, we compare the baseline model with 𝑀𝑜𝑅150 on the BigTom dataset under CoT. This task evaluates LLMs ability to reason about others mental states and false beliefs. The baseline model fails to consider the protagonists changing beliefs, leading to incomplete reasoning and incorrect answers. In contrast, the MoR model selects effective strategies, applying logical thinking to solve the problem correctly. This example demonstrates MoRs strength in theory of mind reasoning, providing superior understanding of complex mental states compared to traditional methods."
