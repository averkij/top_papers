            "content": "The creation of high-fidelity, explorable 3D scenes that users can navigate seamlessly, powers broad applications ranging from video gaming and film production to robotic simulation. Yet, traditional workflows for constructing such 3D worlds remain bottlenecked by manual effort, requiring painstaking layout design, asset curation, and scene composition. While recent data-driven methods [Liu et al. 2024; Meng et al. 2024; Xiang et al. 2024; Xie et al. 2024; Zhao et al. 2025] have shown promise in generating objects or simple scenes, their ability to scale to complex scenes is limited by the scarcity of high-quality 3D scene data. This gap highlights the need for frameworks that enable scalable generation of user-navigable virtual worlds with 3D consistency. Recently, growing number of works [Chen et al. 2025; Gao* et al. 2024; He et al. 2024; Ma et al. 2025; Ren et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2024b; Yu et al. 2024b; Zhou et al. 2025] have explored the use of novel view synthesis (NVS) and video generation as alternative paradigms for world modeling. These methods, while demonstrating impressive capabilities in generating visually appealing and semantically rich content, still face several challenges. 1) Long-Range Spatial Inconsistency. Due to the absence of explicit 3D structural grounding, they often struggle to maintain spatial consistency and coherent viewpoint transitions during the generation process, especially when generating videos with long-range camera trajectories. 2) Visual Hallucination. While several works [Chen et al. 2025; Ren et al. 2025] have attempted to leverage 3D conditions to enhance geometric consistency, they typically rely on partial RGB images as guidance, i.e., novel-view images rendered from point clouds reconstructed with input views. However, such representation may introduce significant visual hallucinations in complex scenes, such as the incorrect occlusions in Figure. 2, which may introduce inaccurate supervision during training. 3) Post-hoc 3D Reconstruction. While these approaches can synthesize visually satisfying content, post-hoc 3D reconstructions are still required to obtain usable 3D content. This process is time-consuming and inevitably introduces geometric artifacts [Weber et al. 2024], making it inadequate for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Voyager, framework designed to synthesize long-range, world-consistent RGB-D(epth) videos from single image and user-specified camera trajectories. At the core of Voyager is novel world-consistent video diffusion that utilizes an expandable world caching mechanism to ensure spatial consistency and avoids visual hallucination. Starting from an Fig. 2. Partial RGB images and partial depth maps rendered from point clouds at different frames. In scenarios involving complex occlusion relationships, partial RGB images often exhibit significant visual artifacts. In contrast, partial depth maps can accurately represent occlusions. image, we construct an initial world cache by unprojecting it into 3D space with depth map. This 3D cache is then projected into target camera views to obtain partial RGB-D observations, which guides the diffusion model to maintain coherence with the accumulated world state. Crucially, the generated frames are fed back to update and expand the world cache, creating closed-loop system that supports arbitrary camera trajectories while maintaining geometric coherence. Unlike methods [Chen et al. 2025; Ma et al. 2025; Ren et al. 2025; Yu et al. 2024b] relying only on RGB conditioning, Voyager explicitly leverages depth information as spatial prior, enabling more accurate 3D consistency during video generation. By simultaneously generating aligned RGB and depth sequences, our framework supports direct 3D scene reconstruction without requiring additional 3D reconstruction steps like structure-from-motion. Despite promising performance, diffusion models struggle to generate long videos in single pass. To enable long-range world exploration, we propose world caching scheme and smooth video sampling for auto-regressive scene extension. Our world cache accumulates and maintains point clouds from all previously generated frames, expanding as video sequences grow. To optimize computational efficiency, we design point culling method to detect and remove redundant points with real-time rendering, minimizing memory overhead. Leveraging cached point clouds as proxy, we develop smooth sampling strategy that auto-regressively extends video length while ensuring smooth transitions between clips. Training such model requires large-scale videos with accurate camera poses and depth, but existing datasets often lack these annotations. To address this, we introduce data engine for scalable video reconstruction that automatically estimates camera poses and metric depth for arbitrary scene videos. With metric depth estimation, our data engine ensures consistent depth scales across diverse sources, enabling high-quality training data generation. Using this pipeline, we compile dataset of over 100,000 video clips, combining real-world captures and synthetic Unreal Engine renders. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Voyager in scene video generation and 3D world reconstruction. Benefiting from joint depth modeling, our results in Figure 1 exhibit more coherent geometry, which not only enable direct 3D reconstruction but also support infinite world expansion while preserving the original spatial layout. Additionally, we explore applications such as 3D generation, video transfer, and depth estimation, further showcasing the potential of Voyager in advancing spatial intelligence. Our contributions can be summarized as: Voyager: Long-Range and World-Consistent Video Diffusion for Explorable 3D Scene Generation 3 We introduce Voyager, world-consistent video diffusion model for scene generation. To the best of our knowledge, Voyager is the first video model that jointly generates RGB and depth sequences with given camera trajectories. We propose an efficient world caching scheme and autoregressive video sampling approach, extending Voyager to world reconstruction and infinite world exploration. We propose scalable video data engine for camera and metric depth estimation, with over 100,000 training pairs prepared for the video diffusion model."

These methods rely on dense viewpoints and struggle to handle single-view inputs. The second method [Guo et al. 2023; He et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2024b; Zhou et al. 2025] implicitly incorporates camera parameters into the model, training it to generate images from the corresponding viewpoints, but often suffers from viewpoint inconsistency. The third method [Chen et al. 2025; Ma et al. 2025; Ren et al. 2025; Seo et al. 2024] leverages point clouds obtained by warping the input view as conditions for novel view generation, significantly improving spatial consistency. However, the warped images still contain artifacts that negatively affect model training. In this work, we introduce warping depth as an additional conditioning input and generate both RGB and depth content."

The warped RGB condition ˆ𝐼𝑣 for novel view 𝑣 can then be rendered according to the camera, which is partial image with blank regions. Nonetheless, such partial RGB image is insufficient to ensure spatial consistency, e.g., complex occlusion relationships in scene may lead to visual hallucinations. To enforce spatially consistent 4 Tianyu Huang, Wangguandong Zheng, Tengfei Wang, Yuhao Liu et al. Fig. 3.

The projected points are store in our world cache efficiently, which can be rendered as condition for the next round generation. control during training, we introduce an additional geometric condition partial depth map, which is aligned with the partial RGB image. Specifically, we first estimate the depth map 𝐷𝑘 and corresponding camera parameters 𝑐𝑘 for each frame 𝐼𝑘 of the video. Since only the first frame is visible in video inference, we create point cloud 𝑝0 by projecting 𝐷0 with 𝑐0. For the 𝑘-th frame, its partial image ˆ𝐼𝑘 and partial depth ˆ𝐷𝑘 are acquired by masking the invisible region with the rendering mask 𝑀𝑘 = render(𝑝0, 𝑐𝑘 )."

            "content": "Conditioned with partial RGB and depth maps, our intention is to generate plausible content for the invisible regions, ensuring consistency with the spatial information provided by the partial conditions. For this purpose, the common practice [Labs 2024; Ren et al. 2025] is to concatenate the condition latents zrgb and zdepth with original noisy latents z𝑡 along the channel axis and project the concatenated latents back to the Transformer dimension via the patch-embedding layer 𝑓emb: 𝑡,0 = 𝑓emb (concat(z𝑡 , zrgb, zdepth)). Then, the projected latents 𝑡,0 are fed to double-stream and singlestream blocks sequentially, which is formulated as, 𝑡,𝑖, z 𝑦,𝑖 = 𝑓 𝑖 𝐷 (z 𝑡,𝑖 , 𝑦,𝑖 1 , 𝑡), 𝑖 = 1, ..., 𝑁𝐷, (1) 𝑡,𝑖 = 𝑓 𝑖 𝑆 (z , 𝑡), 𝑖 = 1, ..., 𝑁𝑆, 𝑡,𝑖 1 𝑡,𝑁 and where each stream. (2) 𝑦 is the text latents. 𝑁𝐷 and 𝑁𝑆 denote the block number of 𝑡,0 is initialized as the concatenation of 𝑦,𝑁 . Although the video model can best preserve the pre-trained parameters in this way, the spatial conditions is only used in channelwise. The missing parts in our partial maps can range from small cracks to large blank areas, depending on the extent of the viewpoint change. This trivial solution struggles to handle variable situations. Depth-Fused Video Generation. Instead of relying solely on partial depth as the input condition for completing the missing regions in the RGB frames, we propose to simultaneously generate both complete RGB and depth frames. As result, the video model can take advantage of DiTs full-attention structure, allowing for the interaction of visual and geometric information at the pixel level. To this end, we concatenate the rgb and depth images along the height axis as I𝑘 = [𝐼𝑘, Φ, 𝐷𝑘 ]ℎ, as well as condition maps ˆI𝑘 = [ ˆ𝐼𝑘, Φ, ˆ𝐷𝑘 ]ℎ and masks 𝑀𝑘 = [𝑀𝑘, Φ, 𝑀𝑘 ]ℎ. Here, we add placeholder row Φ between the rgb and depth images to help the model separate these two types of content. The new video latents are presented 𝑡,0 = 𝑓emb (concat(z𝑡 , ˆz0, 𝑚)), where ˆz0 is the latent of [ ˆI𝑘 ]𝑇 1 as 𝑘=0 and 𝑚 is the down-sampled map of [𝑀𝑘 ]𝑇 1 𝑘=0 via max-pooling. Accordingly, 𝑡,0 is fed to the diffusion model similar to Eq. 1-2. The diffusion model is thus trained to generate rgb-depth video frames. Context-Based Control Enhancement. The above concatenation mechanism incorporates conditional information only at the input of the DiT model, leading to weak enforcement of the geometric conditions and resulting in misalignment between generated frames and input conditions. To enhance the geometric-following capabilities, following [Bian et al. 2025], we further inject the diffusion model with lightweight modules. Concretely, we replicate the first block from the doublestream and single-stream modules as the Control blocks ˆ𝑓𝐷 and ˆ𝑓𝑆 . Given the input video latent 𝑡,0, we have the following operations for each Transformer block 𝑖: z𝐷 = ˆ𝑓𝐷 (z 𝑡,𝑖 + 𝑙𝐷 (z𝐷 ), (4) where 𝑙𝐷 and 𝑙𝑆 are zero-initialized linear layers. Early-stage latent features preserve more contextual information, so that the integration into each block can strengthen pixel-level controllability. 𝑡,0), z𝑆 = ˆ𝑓𝑆 (z𝐷 ), 𝑡,𝑖 = 𝑡,𝑖 + 𝑙𝑆 (z𝑆 ), 𝑡,𝑖 = z (3)"

            "content": "For long-range or even infinite video generation, auto-regressive is natural choice. This paradigm recursively generates future frames or clips based on previously generated content, maintaining temporal continuity over time. However, due to the limited memory capacity of video diffusion models, auto-regressive methods are often restricted to conditioning on only few preceding frames or clips.

This limited context leads to inevitable information loss, making it fundamentally infeasible to retain and propagate the full scene history. In contrast to previous auto-regressive methods, Voyager exploits point-cloud conditions for generation, which is scalable representation to store the whole history information. To enable infinite generation, we propose world caching with point culling to efficiently store spatial information and adopt smooth video sampling to ensure the consistency of consecutive clips. World Caching with Point Culling. With input camera parameters and corresponding RGB-D video frames, point clouds can be projected to 3D space as ˆ𝑝 R(𝑇 𝐻 𝑊 ) 3, where 𝑇 is the number of total frames. As the video continues to extend, the number of points can easily grow to millions, posing significant challenges in terms of memory and computational efficiency. To address that, we propose to maintain world cache, which eliminates redundant points while preserving essential geometric information. Specifically, we incrementally add new points to the cache on per-frame basis: given the accumulated point cloud ˆ𝑝 from previous frames, we render visibility mask 𝑀 = render( ˆ𝑝, 𝑐𝑖 ) from the current camera view 𝑐𝑖 . Points in the invisible regions are added to ˆ𝑝 first. For the visible regions, if the angle between the surface normal of existing points and the current view direction exceeds 90 degrees, the new point is also updated into the cache, because these existing points cannot be seen at the current viewpoint. This strategy reduces the number of stored points by approximately 40% and avoids noise accumulation caused by multi-frame aggregation. Smooth Video Sampling. Conditioned on the above world cache, our video model can access the complete spatial information from previous frames. However, although each independently generated video clip is spatially consistent, there can still be color discrepancies, making them unsuitable for direct concatenation. We adopt two strategies to ensure smoother transitions between adjacent clips. (1) We first divide the input video into overlapping segments, where the length of the overlapping region is half of one segment. For each segment, the overlapping region is initialized with the generated results from the previous segment, serving as the noise initialization for the current segments overlap region. (2) After completing inference for the consecutive two segments, we apply averaging across the overlapping regions and introduce light-level noise injection to the merged segments. final round of denoising is then performed to refine transitions. In this way, we ensure the efficient generation of multiple clips while maintaining visual consistency across consecutive video frames."

Data Curation. We selected two open-source real-world datasets, i.e., RealEstate [Zhou et al. 2018] and DL3DV [Ling et al. 2024] for the training. RealEstate contains 74,766 video clips related to real estate scenes, primarily featuring indoor home scenes, along with some outdoor environments. DL3DV provides 10K real-scene videos, but most of them suffer from rapid or shaky camera movements. We curate 3,000 high-quality videos from this dataset and segment them into approximately 18,000 video clips. Additionally, to increase the diversity of generation content, we collected 1,500 Unreal Engine scene models and rendered over 10,000 video samples to augment the dataset. In the end, we collected over 100,000 video clips from these datasets. Data Annotation. Accurate camera parameters and depth are crucial for model training, but RealEstate and DL3DV do not provide such ground-truth data. Existing methods [Chen et al. 2025; Ren et al. 2025; Schwarz et al. 2025] adopt dense stereo models [Teed and Deng 2021] to prepare training pairs, struggling to produce geometrically consistent depth. We propose more robust data processing engine. Specifically, we first use VGGT [Wang et al. 2025] to estimate camera parameters and depth for all video frames. The depth estimated by VGGT is not accurate enough, but it is aligned with camera poses. To further improve the depth estimation, we then employ MoGE [Wang et al. 2024a] as robust depth estimator and align the two depth maps with least squares optimization. Finally, since our UE data provides metric depth values, we need to align all the estimated depth to standard scale. We estimate the metric depth range of the scene using Metric3D [Hu et al. 2024] and map the previous depths into this range. This way, we can automatically annotate camera and depth for videos from any source."

            "title": "6 Application",
            "content": "Benefiting from our depth-fused video generation, Voyager supports various 3D-related applications. Long Video Generation. As explained in Sec. 4.3, our method allows long-range video generation with efficient world caching and smooth video sampling. In Figure 6(a), we provide an example consisting of three video clips, with totally different camera trajectories among clips. The results present camera controllability and spatial consistency of the generated video, demonstrating that our method is capable of long-range world exploration. Image-to-3D Generation. Native 3D generative models can hardly handle the generation of multiple objects. In Figure 6(b), we use three state-of-the-art 3D generation methods Trellis [Xiang et al. 2024], Rodin v1.5 [RodinAI 2025], and Hunyuan-3D v2.5 [Hunyuan3D 2025] to generate simple combination where car leans against tent. Rodin failed to generate the tent, while Trellis produced tent with missing parts. Hunyuan successfully generated two complete objects, but the spatial relationship was inaccurate, with the tent being too far from the car. Our method not only generates the correct content, but also produces more realistic visual effects. The tent is even visible through the car window in the side view. Depth-Consistent Video Transfer. Generating spatially consistent video with different style typically requires training stylized video model. However, to achieve the desired effect with our model, we only need to replace the reference image while retaining the original depth condition. As shown in Figure 6(c), we can change the original video to American-style or to the night. Video Depth Estimation. Our video model is naturally capable of estimating video depth. In Figure 6(d), our predicted depth can preserve the details on the architectures."

The proposed RGB-D video diffusion model can produce spatially consistent video sequences that align with the input camera trajectories, allowing direct 3D scene reconstruction. This supports auto-regressive and consistent world expansion. Experiments demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong spatial coherence in both generated videos and point clouds. 8 Tianyu Huang, Wangguandong Zheng, Tengfei Wang, Yuhao Liu et al. Fig. 6.

We divide the training into three stages: the first stage only trains the RGB video model; in the second stage, depth is introduced into the training; and in the third stage, the DiT parameters are frozen and ControlNet blocks are incorporated for training. We use all three datasets in the first training stage. However, DL3DV is removed in the second stage due to its fast camera motion, which makes it unsuitable for depth training. In the third stage, we train solely on the UE dataset with its ground-truth depth. During training, we randomly select width-height ratio from [1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75] to support the generation of videos with multiple aspect ratios. The number of generation frames for single pass is 49. Fig. 9. Details of world-consistent diffusion model. World-Consistent Video Diffusion We provide the details of our video diffusion model in Figure 9. The input of the diffusion model includes noisy latents z𝑡 , input image latents z𝑟 0, condition latents ˆz0, and down-sampled mask 𝑚. To align the temporal dimension, we pad z𝑟 0 with zero latents. In the first stage of training, only the RGB-related latents are concatenated in the channel dimension and are then fed to the diffusion model. In the second stage, we inject depth-related latents into the input. We fine-tune the parameters of the original diffusion structure in the first two stages, two additional Transformer blocks are trained in the final stage. The aggregated features in these two blocks are added back on pixel-wise basis."

Compared to Flexworld [Chen et al. 2025], since our depth estimation method is more consistent and accurate than the depth rendered by 3DGS, our warped images are more precise, as shown in Fig. 11.

To further improve the depth estimation, we then employ MoGE [Wang et al. 2024a] as robust depth estimator. Specifically, we first convert the depth into disparity, and then use least squaresbased optimization strategy to minimize the disparity difference between the depth frames generated by VGGT and those generated by MoGE. The optimization is represented as: min 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒,𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:18) 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 𝑑𝑀𝑜𝐺𝐸 + 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 1 𝑑𝑉 𝐺𝐺𝑇 (cid:19)(cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) , (5) where 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 and 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 represent the scale and shift factors respectively.
