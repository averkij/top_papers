Introduction Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023, Guo et al., 2025, Yang et al., 2025, Comanici et al., 2025) have enabled agentic systems (Xu et al., 2025b, Chang et al., 2025, Zhang et al., 2025c, Xie et al., 2025) that tightly couple perception, deliberation, and actuation, thereby reducing the need for continuous human supervision (Yao et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2025b). These successes increasingly motivate framing agent improvement as reinforcement learning (RL) over long-horizon trajectories-optimizing tool use, planning, and control policies end-to-end from interaction feedback (Feng et al., 2025b, Wang et al., 2025b). However, RL training for LLM agents remain difficult. major challenge arises from the burden of long-context processing (Lu et al., 2025, Kang et al., 2025). As agents interact with environments through multi-turn decision loops, they must buffer comprehensive trajectory of past observations and action sequences. As shown in Fig. 1(a), this historical data accumulates relentlessly, causing the input context to swell to massive volume of tokens within single trajectory. Such rapid expansion not only exhausts the finite token budget of current LLMs but also incurs prohibitive inference latency and compute cost due to expensive attention prefill and KV-cache management (Shah et al., 2024, Jiang et al., 2024). Recent breakthroughs in vision language models (VLMs) (Bai et al., 2025b,a, Chen et al., 2024b) and optical character recognition (OCR) (Wei et al., 2025, Cui et al., 2025a, Xing et al., 2025) suggest promising solution: visual information density. Notably, DeepSeek-OCR (Wei et al., 2025) shows that the visual modality can serve as far more compact carrier of information than text. By rendering textual content into images, the token footprint can be compressed by approximately 10 compared to raw text tokens, substantially reducing the number of *Equal Contribution AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression Figure 1: Comparison of text agent and AgentOCR. (a) Text agent accumulates heavy token burden from raw text history. (b) Our AgentOCR requires significantly fewer visual tokens via optical self-compression. tokens processed during model inference. Building on this, we propose AgentOCR, visually-grounded method that reimagines agent history not as string of text, but as dynamic sequence of images (Fig. 1(b)). Specifically, AgentOCR represents the accumulated observation-action history as compact image and conditions the agents policy on this visual history for the multi-turn decision making. To ensure scalability and efficiency in long rollouts, AgentOCR introduces an segment optical caching. This mechanism decomposes the history context into segments and maintains hash-based optical cache, allowing the agent to reuse previously rendered content and avoid redundant processing as the history expands. Beyond static image, AgentOCR features agentic self-compression, which empowers the agent to actively modulate its own visual fidelity at each step. By learning via RL, AgentOCR adaptively selects the most appropriate compression factor to save token costs, thereby achieving favorable balance between task success and efficiency. We evaluate AgentOCR on two challenging agentic benchmarks: ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021), which features long-horizon decision-making, and search-based QA (Jin et al., 2025), characterized by highly text-dense interactions. Our results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95% of the task performance of strong text-based agent pipelines, while reducing token consumption by over 50% (up to 80% in peak tokens), leading to substantially lower overhead. Furthermore, our analysis validates that segment optical caching accelerates rendering by over 20, and self-compression mechanism effectively optimizes the trade-off between information density and cost. 2. Related Work 2.1. Reinforcement Learning for LLM Agents RL (Sutton and Barto, 2018) has become commonly adopted paradigm for aligning agents with human preferences (Stiennon et al., 2020, Ouyang et al., 2022, Rafailov et al., 2023) and improving their behaviors (Sheng 2 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2025a) in complex scenarios, such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), Dr. GRPO (Liu et al., 2025b), Clip-Cov (Cui et al., 2025b), GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025), DAPO (Yu et al., 2025b), and GiGPO (Feng et al., 2025b). These RL-trained agents have been widely deployed in dynamic and open-ended environments, spanning interactive games (Narasimhan et al., 2015, Brockman et al., 2016), GUI control (Rawles et al., 2023, Ye et al., 2025, Liu et al., 2025a), embodied tasks (Shridhar et al., 2021), as well as web (Zhou and Zanette, 2024, Putta et al., 2024, Feng et al., 2025a) and tool-enhanced environments (Qian et al., 2025, Sun et al., 2025, Dong et al., 2025, Xue et al., 2025). 2.2. Optical Character Recognition OCR converts textual information in images into computer-readable text and has been widely applied in document digitization (Doermann, 1998, Smith, 2007, Arlazarov et al., 2022), image text extraction (Jaderberg et al., 2016, Baek et al., 2019, Long et al., 2018), and document parsing (Katti et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2020, Rausch et al., 2021). With the advent of deep learning, OCR systems have shifted toward end-to-end frameworks, including Nougat (Blecher et al., 2023), Donut (Kim et al., 2022), TrOCR (Li et al., 2023), Pix2Struct (Lee et al., 2023) and GOT-OCR2.0 (Wei et al., 2024), enabling unified image-to-text modeling for complex scenarios. Recently, OCR has begun to be explored as vision-text compression mechanism, such as DeepSeek-OCR (Wei et al., 2025), VIST (Xing et al., 2025), and Glyph (Cheng et al., 2025). These approaches offer novel solution for processing extremely long contexts, however, research in this direction remains in its early stages. 2.3. Agent Memory Long-horizon interaction with LLM-based agents requires persistent memory, but naively appending full histories quickly exceeds fixed context windows (Zhang et al., 2025d,b, Hu et al., 2025b). Accordingly, long-context language modeling focuses on efficiency and length generalization, including sparse or hierarchical attention (Beltagy et al., 2020, Fu et al., 2024, Xiao et al., 2024), recency-biased positional schemes (Ding et al., 2024, Su et al., 2024, Xiong et al., 2024), and prompt compression (Ge et al., 2023, Yoon et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024). In parallel, retrieval-based methods treat external stores as non-parametric memory and fetch relevant information on demand (Ge et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2024a). Beyond context optimization, recent agent frameworks introduce explicit memory modules to support long-term behavior, ranging from virtualized context management and scalable backends (Packer et al., 2023, Chhikara et al., 2025) to structured or hierarchical representations for extended and multi-agent tasks (Xu et al., 2025a, Anokhin et al., 2024, Hu et al., 2025a, Zhang et al., 2025a). More recent work explores learning-based memory control, where agents adaptively write, retain, and retrieve information, treating memory as an active component (Yan et al., 2025, Zhou et al., 2025, Yu et al., 2025a). 3. Preliminaries 3.1. Problem Setup We formulate the interaction between an LLM agent and an environment (e.g., physical simulator or an external tool API) as sequential decision-making process over finite horizon 𝑇 N. The agent is instantiated as an LLM parameterized by 𝜃, and its behavior is modeled as stochastic policy 𝜋𝜃. At each step 𝑡 {1, . . . , 𝑇 }, the agent receives an observation o𝑡 𝒪 (e.g., API outputs) and has the interaction history up to step 𝑡 as The agent then samples textual action a𝑡 𝜋𝜃( ℐ, h𝑡), where ℐ denotes the task instruction, a𝑡 𝒱 𝑛 is token sequence drawn from the vocabulary 𝒱 with maximum length 𝑛 N. The action a𝑡 is flexible and may h𝑡 = (o1, a1, o2, a2, . . . , o𝑡). (1) 3 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression explicitly include intermediate reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022)) or tool invocations. After executing a𝑡, the environment returns scalar reward 𝑟𝑡 and the next observation o𝑡+1. Notably, h𝑡 often becomes extensively long due to extended horizons or verbose environmental observations, posing significant challenges for context processing. 3.2. Agentic Reinforcement Learning RL has become standard post-training paradigm for enhancing LLM agents. While our work is algorithm-agnostic and compatible with various agentic RL algorithms, we consider Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) as the representative algorithm due to its simplicity and efficiency. Specifically, GRPO samples group of trajectories {𝜏𝑖}𝐺 izing rewards within the group. To ensure training stability, we optimize the clipped surrogate objective: for each input and estimates advantages ˆ𝐴𝑖 by normal𝑖=1 𝐽 (𝜃) = [ 1 𝐺𝑇 𝐺 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑡=1 min ( 𝜌𝑡,𝑖 ˆ𝐴𝑖, clip(𝜌𝑡,𝑖, 1 𝜖) ˆ𝐴𝑖 )] , (2) where 𝜌𝑡,𝑖 = 𝜋𝜃(a𝑡,𝑖ℐ,h𝑡,𝑖) is the importance sampling ratio, 𝜖 is the clipping hyperparameter. Here, we omit the 𝜋𝜃old (a𝑡,𝑖ℐ,h𝑡,𝑖) KL-divergence regularization for notational brevity. Crucially, optimizing Eq. (2) necessitates computing gradients over the entire cumulative history h𝑡. In realistic agent scenarios, h𝑡 rapidly accumulates thousands of tokens (e.g., >10k tokens in multi-turn search tasks (Jin et al., 2025)). Since the computational complexity and memory footprint scale with token count, processing such lengthy textual trajectories becomes prohibitively expensive. 4. AgentOCR Agentic tasks require the policy to condition on an ever-growing multi-turn interaction history. This growth creates severe bottleneck in practice. Not only does it reach the models context window limits, but it also drives up computational costs as transformer computation scales superlinearly with sequence length. Hence, efficient token compression is imperative for deploying LLM agents. In this section, we introduce AgentOCR that addresses this bottleneck by reimagining interaction history as an optical memory. Instead of processing raw textual logs, we render the accumulated history into compact visual representation. By leveraging the superior information density of visual tokens compared to text, this approach substantially reduces the token footprint while maintaining full access to historical details. To ensure scalability and dynamic adaptability in long-horizon rollouts, AgentOCR incorporates two innovations: (1) segment optical caching (Fig. 2(a)), which eliminates redundant rendering overhead by systematically reusing cached visual segments, and (2) agentic self-compression (Fig. 2(b)), mechanism that empowers the agent to actively modulate the compression rate, thereby optimizing the trade-off between information density and token cost. In the remainder of this section, we detail optical encoding in Sec. 4.1 for visual representation, followed by segment optical caching in Sec. 4.2 and self-compression and RL training in Sec. 4.3. 4.1. Optical Memory Encoding Memory buffer. AgentOCR maintains an external memory buffer ℳ𝑡 that stores the interaction records up to step 𝑡. Each record contains an observation-action pair (o𝑡, a𝑡) (or task-specific equivalents such as tool queries and results). The memory module serializes the entire interaction history into textual form h𝑡 = Fetch(ℳ𝑡1). AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression Figure 2: Overview of AgentOCR. (a) Segment optical caching decomposes the history context into segments, reuses cached renderings via content keys, and assembles the optical memory by stacking segment images. (b) The agent receives the optical observation and history, selects an environment action, and compression rate. (c) The agent is trained with RL, jointly optimizing task performance and token efficiency. Memory rendering. We define deterministic renderer ℛ that maps the textual interaction history to an RGB image I𝑡 = ℛ(h𝑡; 𝜓), where 𝜓 denotes rendering hyperparameters (e.g., font family and size, colors, padding, and bounds on image width and height). At step 𝑡, AgentOCR constructs multimodal policy input by combining ℐ and the rendered history image I𝑡, and samples an action from vision-language policy: a𝑡 𝜋𝜃( ℐ, I𝑡). The sampled action a𝑡 is then applied to the environment to obtain the next observation o𝑡+1, and the memory buffer is updated accordingly. 4.2. Segment Optical Caching Rendering the entire history h𝑡 from scratch at every step is wasteful and becomes major latency bottleneck in multi-turn rollouts. naive alternative is to render only the newly appended context and append it to the previously rendered history image. This yields near-constant per-step rendering overhead, but it cannot reuse recurring content, and its memory still grows with the accumulated rendered pixels. AgentOCR instead performs caching at the granularity of segments. The core idea is to decompose the full history context into independent segments and memory rendered segments in dictionary keyed by segment content. At each step, we assemble the history image by stacking cached segment images in order, rendering only segments that have not been seen before. This cache naturally accelerates both recurring boilerplate and repeated tool outputs, and can also reuse newly arrived observations/actions whenever they match previously observed segments. Segment representation. We split the history context into segments. Let Split(h) = (ℓ1, . . . , ℓ𝐾 ) denote this operation, where each ℓ𝑖 is text segment. We use deterministic segment renderer ℛ(ℓ; 𝜓) that maps single segment to an RGB image under the same rendering hyperparameters. 5 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression Segment cache. For each environment instance 𝑒, AgentOCR maintains per-episode cache 𝒞(𝑒) = {(𝑘(ℓ), I(ℓ))}, (3) where 𝑘(ℓ) is fast content key (e.g., hash of the normalized segment text, optionally including style metadata) and I(ℓ) is the rendered image of segment ℓ. Unlike naive cache, which incrementally renders the newly appended context, this cache stores each unique segment at most once and reuses it whenever the same segment reappears. In our implementation, 𝒞(𝑒) persists within an episode and is reset at episode boundaries. Cache lookup and assembly. At step 𝑡, we obtain the full history h𝑡 and split it into segments Split(h𝑡) = (ℓ𝑡,1, . . . , ℓ𝑡,𝐾𝑡). For each segment ℓ𝑡,𝑖, we first query the cache. On miss, we render and insert it: I(ℓ𝑡,𝑖) = {𝒞(𝑒)[𝑘(ℓ𝑡,𝑖)], ℛ(ℓ𝑡,𝑖; 𝜓), if 𝑘(ℓ𝑡,𝑖) 𝒞(𝑒), otherwise. if miss: 𝒞(𝑒)[𝑘(ℓ𝑡,𝑖)] I(ℓ𝑡,𝑖). The full optical memory image is then constructed by vertically stacking segment images in order: I𝑡 = Stack ( I(ℓ𝑡,𝑖) )𝐾𝑡 . 𝑖=1 (4) (5) (6) Because newly appended observations or actions are processed as just additional segments, they can be reused without re-rendering whenever they match cached content (e.g., repeated queries and tool responses). Complexity. Let 𝑈𝑡 be the number of cache-miss segments among {ℓ𝑡,𝑖}𝐾𝑡 . The per-step rendering cost becomes 𝑖=1 𝑂(𝑈𝑡) segment renders, while cache hits require only dictionary lookup and image stacking. In many agent workloads, interaction logs contain substantial repetition, so typically 𝑈𝑡 𝐾𝑡 and rendering overhead is significantly reduced. For spatial complexity, the cache stores one image per unique segment per episode, yielding 𝑂(𝒞(𝑒)) images rather than 𝑂(𝑇 ) full-history images, thereby avoiding heavy duplication across environment timesteps. 4.3. Agentic Self-Compression Instead of treating the optical renderer ℛ (defined in Sec. 4.1) as static background Compression decision. process, AgentOCR exposes it as an executable tool. We conceptualize this interaction as parameterized invocation alongside environment actions, the policy generates structured call via <compression>𝑐𝑡</compression>, where the compression factor 𝑐𝑡 1 dynamically modulates the rendering fidelity. This design aligns with standard tool-use paradigms, allowing the agent to explicitly query its interaction history with variable precision. Upon receiving the call, the system executes the renderer with the specified compression factor. Formally, this produces scaled image I𝑡+1: size(I𝑡+1) = ( 𝐻𝑡+1 𝑐𝑡 𝑊𝑡+1 𝑐𝑡 , ) . (7) This spatial downsampling operation effectively reduces the number of visual tokens. Consequently, the agent can strategically modulate the compression rate based on specific task characteristics, thereby optimizing the trade-off between token cost and information density. AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression Compression-aware reward. To incentivize the agent to identify suitable compression without compromising task success, we introduce compression-aware reward term for RL training. This reward is strictly conditioned on episode success, ensuring that the agent treats compression as secondary cost-optimization objective rather than primary goal. Then, we employ logarithmic reward formulation that reflects the diminishing returns of information density. Formally, let Isucc(𝜏 ) {0, 1} be the success indicator. The compression reward at step 𝑡 is defined as: comp 𝑟 𝑡 = {ln(𝑐𝑡), 0, if Isucc(𝜏 ) = 1, otherwise. (8) comp 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝑡 + 𝜆𝑟 𝑡 The total reward used for RL optimization is given by , where 𝜆 0 is the weight parameter of compression reward, which controls the trade-off between task performance and compression efficiency. This scalar reward is used by the agentic RL optimizer (e.g., GRPO) to update the policy 𝜋𝜃 through the objective in comp Eq. (2). However, applying the compression reward 𝑟 at every training iteration can induce overly greedy 𝑡 behavior, where the agent aggressively increases compression to maximize immediate reward. To mitigate this effect, we adopt an intermittent reinforcement schedule, injecting the compression reward only at intervals of 𝐾 training iterations. This schedule introduces the efficiency signal periodically while maintaining the primary optimization pressure on task completion. Under this design, AgentOCR learns to allocate vision tokens adaptively, achieving further token reduction while maintaining strong task performance. 5. Experiment In this section, we present comprehensive empirical evaluations of AgentOCR across two representative multi-turn agent benchmarks. Specifically, our experiments aim to investigate the following key aspects: (1) the comparative performance and token efficiency of AgentOCR relative to text-based agents; (2) the quantitative analysis of the vision-text compression ratio of AgentOCR; (3) the computational efficiency of the segment optical caching mechanism; (4) the ablation study on the effectiveness of the self-compression mechanism. 5.1. Experimental Setup Benchmarks. We evaluate AgentOCR on ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) and search-based QA (Jin et al., 2025). Both benchmarks exhibit sustained context growth but with different interaction profiles. ALFWorld contains the embodied tasks, requiring the agent to manipulate objects within simulated household environment. Search-based QA, conversely, focuses on multi-turn tool use and information retrieval. The agent must actively interact with search engine to query external knowledge, requiring it to deal with denser, web-style textual traces. Baselines. We compare AgentOCR against both text-based and optical-history variants across prompting and RL regimes. Specifically, we evaluate: (1) Text (w/o RL), which feeds raw textual history to text-only model; (2) OCR (w/o RL), which conditions the model on rendered optical memory images without RL; and (3) Text + GRPO, strong baseline that applies RL directly to the raw textual context. In contrast, our AgentOCR applies GRPO to the optical-memory agent, enabling efficient optimization over compact visual histories. Training details. We use the Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025b) family as the backbone models. Text-only variants use Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct, while optical-history variants use Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct. We keep all training settings and hyperparameters identical across methods to ensure controlled comparisons. For extra hyperparameters of AgentOCR, we set 𝜆 = 0.01 and 𝐾 = 5.

Main Results We first evaluate the overall performance of all methods, with results reported in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2. direct comparison of the inference-only baselines (Text vs. OCR) reveals the inherent efficiency advantage of the visual modality. Across both benchmarks, optical history drastically reduces token consumption, cutting average usage by approximately 55% on ALFWorld and 70% on search tasks. However, this compression initially comes at cost. The off-the-shelf VLM struggles to ground the condensed visual history effectively, resulting in substantial performance drop relative to their text-based counterparts. AgentOCR effectively bridges this gap through RL training, aligning the policy to the visual modality to attain task performance comparable to text-based baselines across model scales. On ALFWorld, AgenOCR with 3B and 7B models achieves 78.2% and 81.2% respectively, virtually matching the text agents (within 1% margin). This trend holds for search tasks, where AgentOCR retains over 95% of the performance of the Text+GRPO baselines (e.g., achieving 40.1% vs. 41.9% on the 7B model). Crucially, these results underscore that AgentOCR offers highly favorable trade-off between token cost and task success. Rather than merely matching the baseline, our method fundamentally alleviates the inference bottleneck by slashing token consumption by >50% (up to 80.9% in peak contexts), proving that high-density visual representations can support rigorous agentic reasoning with 8 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression significantly reduced overhead. 5.3. Vision-Text Compression Analysis In this part, we investigate the trade-off between token compression efficiency and task performance using the trained AgentOCR (7B) across varying fixed compression factors (𝑐𝑡 [1.0, 2.0]). As illustrated in Fig. 3, increasing the compression factor yields substantial gains in token efficiency but incurs performance penalty. Notably, we identify robust compression zone up to 55% token savings (at 𝑐𝑡 = 1.2), where the model successfully maintains over 95% of the text-based performance (99.5% for ALFWorld and 95.0% for Search). However, surpassing this efficiency threshold triggers an accelerated performance decay. For instance, as savings increase further to 67% (𝑐𝑡 = 2.0), the average performance drops significantly, highlighting the non-linear tension between information density and reasoning accuracy. Figure 3: Vision-text compression efficiency. The bars (left axis) denote the success rate relative to the text-based agent baseline, while the lines (right axis) indicate the percentage of tokens saved. We further observe distinct divergence in robustness beyond this threshold. ALFWorld demonstrates high resilience, retaining 87.2% of performance even at 𝑐𝑡 = 2.0, likely due to its reliance on coarse-grained scene understanding. In contrast, the text-dense search task is highly sensitive, with performance plummeting to 66.8% as aggressive downscaling blurs critical textual cues. These findings underscore the necessity of our agentic self-compression mechanism. While static image offers safe baseline, dynamic policy is required to exploit higher compression rates in robust steps while reverting to high fidelity for sensitive reasoning, thereby breaking the static trade-off ceiling. 5.4. Analysis of Cache To evaluate the scalability of segment optical caching, we compare it against two alternatives: no cache, which re-renders the full history h𝑡 at every step, and naive cache, which incrementally renders the newly appended context at step 𝑡 and appends it to growing optical-memory image.

Tab. 3 shows that no cache suffers from large latency and strong growth over time (3509.39 ms on average and 115.43 ms/step), reflecting the redundant cost of repeatedly rendering an increasingly long history. Naive cache removes this time growth and achieves 17.28 speedup, since each step renders only the appended suffix, AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression yielding an effective per-step cost of 𝑂(1) in typical rollouts. However, because it treats each newly arrived line as distinct and permanently appends the rendered result, its cache memory still grows with rollout length (151.41 MB peak and 2.79 MB/step), i.e., space scales with the accumulated rendered pixels. Segment optical caching further reduces per-step rendering work. By memoizing newline-level segments in content-keyed dictionary, newly appended context can often be satisfied by cache hits and thus requires no rendering. Therefore, the number of cache-miss segments may shrink as the cache warms up, producing negative time growth (1.23 ms/step) and the best average latency (168.77 ms). Meanwhile, segment-level reuse also reduces redundant storage (110.80 MB), corresponding to 26.82% peak-memory saving relative to naive cache and aligning with space scaling dominated by the number of unique segments rather than the number of steps. 5.5. Analysis of Self-Compression At last, we conduct ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of the agentic self-compression mechanism using the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the ALFWorld. The results are summarized in Tab. 4. Configuration SR (%) Avg. 𝑐𝑡 Avg. Vis. Tok. w/o Self-Compression Self-Compression Without RL 12.1 11.8 1.00 1.05 441.2 436.9 RL Training 78.4 45.3 78. w/o Self-Compression Self-Compression (𝐾=1) Self-Compression (𝐾=5) The results demonstrate that RL is essential for effectively leveraging the self-compression mechanism. In the absence of RL, AgentOCR lacks the prior knowledge required to modulate the compression factor, resulting in negligible change in token usage and slight performance decline compared to the fixed baseline. When RL is applied with dense reward schedule (𝐾 = 1), the agent prioritizes the immediate compression reward by aggressively increasing the compression factor to 4.91, which degrades visual fidelity and causes the success rate to plummet to 45.3%. However, by adopting the intermittent reinforcement schedule (𝐾 = 5), AgentOCR successfully balances the trade-off between information density and token cost. This configuration learns favorable compression rate, reducing average visual token consumption from 458.1 to 381.7 while maintaining success rate of 78.2%, comparable to the 78.5% achieved by the uncompressed visual baseline. Table 4: Ablation study on self-compression. SR, Avg. 𝑐𝑡, and Avg. Vis. Tok. denote the success rate, average compression factor, and average vision tokens, respectively. 458.1 193.2 381.7 1.00 4.91 1.28 6. Conclusion In this work, we present AgentOCR as an exploration into the potential of visual tokens as compact history medium for multi-turn LLM agents. By integrating segment optical caching to mitigate rendering overhead and agentic self-compression to adaptively balance cost and fidelity, our method demonstrates that the visual modality can effectively complement textual history. Empirical results on ALFWorld and search-based QA suggest that this optical approach allows agents to retain the majority of their decision-making capabilities while significantly reducing token consumption, offering resource-efficient alternative to text-only processing. We envision future research expanding on this foundation to explore hybrid storage architectures and unified multimodal interfaces, moving closer to the versatile and efficient information processing found in biological systems. 10 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression 7. Limitations While AgentOCR demonstrates promising results in agentic tasks, several limitations warrant discussion and suggest directions for future work: First, AgentOCR relies on off-the-shelf VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL series) that were not specifically designed for OCR intensive tasks. Although the proposed AgentOCR framework is model-agnostic in principle, we do not evaluate its behavior across broader range of VLM architectures, like DeepSeek-OCR (Wei et al., 2025), with different visual tokenization strategies or patch resolutions. Performance and compression efficiency may vary depending on the inductive biases of the underlying vision encoder. Second, AgentOCR relies on deterministic text-to-image renderer with fixed hyperparameters such as font size, line spacing, color schemes, and image resolution. While we observe stable performance under our default configuration, we do not systematically explore the sensitivity of the agent to different rendering choices. Suboptimal rendering settings may reduce text legibility or distort layout cues, potentially affecting downstream reasoning. Last, the current design assumes agent history consists primarily of text (observations, actions, tool outputs) that can be rendered as text-as-image. However, many realistic agent scenarios involve inherently visual elements: GUI screenshots with complex layouts, scientific plots, diagrams, and structured tables. Investigating compression strategies for such multimodal histories could significantly expand AgentOCRs application scope beyond textcentric domains."

Pseudo Code We provide the detailed pseudo code for AgentOCR to facilitate reproduction. Algorithm 1 handles the backend mechanics: it maintains the segment cache, executes the rendering tool with the requested compression 𝑐𝑡, and computes the efficiency-aware reward. Algorithm 2 details the interaction loop, where the policy explicitly selects the tool parameter 𝑐𝑡 to control the resolution of the subsequent visual observation. B. Experiments B.1. Details of Benchmarks ALFWorld. ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is an embodied environment comprising 3,827 tasks, which is publicly available for non-commercial research purposes. The objective for LLM agents is to accomplish household tasks spanning six categories: Pick & Place, Examine in Light (Look), Clean & Place (Clean), Heat & Place (Heat), Cool & Place (Cool), and Pick Two & Place. At each interaction step, the LLM agent selects an action based on the current observation and interaction history, then receives feedback from the environment to verify task completion. 18 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression Algorithm 2 AgentOCR Policy Rollout 1: Input: Task Instruction ℐ, Total training steps 𝑇max. 2: Initialize: Policy 𝜋𝜃, Env Wrapper ℰ. 3: Initialize: Global training step 𝑡 0. 4: while 𝑡 < 𝑇max do ℰ.Reset() 5: Get initial observation (o𝑡, I𝑡) from ℰ 6: 7: while episode not done do 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: end while // 1.

We utilize the QA dataset used in Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025), which is publicly available for non-commercial research purposes. It contains two categories of benchmark datasets. The first category is singlehop question answering, which includes NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). The second category is multi-hop question answering, which includes HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultiHopQA (2Wiki) (Ho et al., 2020), MuSiQque (Trivedi et al., 2023), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023). In this scenario, the agent autonomously generates search queries during step-by-step reasoning. It uses the E5 retriever (Wang et al., 2022) to retrieve relevant documents from knowledge base, returning the top-3 most relevant passages for each query. The agent then analyzes and reasons over the retrieved information, iteratively refining its queries and incorporating new evidence until it arrives at the final answer. B.2. Details of Training Hyperparameters for ALFWorld. For ALFWorld, we follow the default settings used in GiGPO (Feng et al., 2025b). Text-only variants are assigned maximum prompt length of 5120 tokens. Conversely, optical-history variants are constrained to maximum prompt length of 2048 tokens. Across both modalities, the maximum response length is standardized to 512 tokens. The agent is permitted to interact with the environment for maximum of 50 steps per episode, with full history. The learning rate is fixed at 1e-6. During the training phase, rollouts are executed on 16 samples per iteration, generating 8 trajectories per sample. We grant reward of 10 for successful actions and 0 otherwise. The temperature parameter is set to 1.0 during rollouts and reduced to 0.4 for validation. The mini-batch size is maintained at 256. Consistent with standard practices, no KL-divergence loss is applied during training. Hyperparameters for search-based QA. For the search-based QA tasks, text-only variants operate with an expanded maximum prompt length of 14000 tokens. For optical-history variants, the limit is set to 4096 tokens. Similar to ALFWorld, the maximum response length is capped at 512 tokens. The interaction horizon is shorter, allowing up to 4 environmental steps per episode and retaining full history. The learning rate remains at 1e-6. Training rollouts involve 128 samples per iteration, with each sample producing 8 trajectories. The reward 19 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression structure assigns 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect ones. Rollout temperature is set to 1.0, while validation uses greedy decoding strategy (temperature 0.0). The mini-batch size is 256, and the KL-divergence loss is excluded. B.3. Computing Details All experiments utilizing the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model for both ALFWorld and search-based QA were executed on 2H100 GPUs. Conversely, the larger Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model required configuration of 4H100 GPUs. The agents were trained for total duration of 150 iterations. B.4. Optical Rendering Details The optical memory is generated via deterministic renderer I𝑡 = ℛ(h𝑡; 𝜓). We employ specific typographic settings and semantic color codes to facilitate efficient parsing by the VLM. The detailed rendering hyperparameters 𝜓 for both benchmarks are provided in Tab. 5. B.5. Prompts The specific prompts employed for agents on the ALFWorld and search-based QA tasks are illustrated in Fig. 4, 5, 6, and 7. Specifically, Fig. 4 and 6 detail the templates for text-only baselines, whereas Fig. 5 and 7 present the templates for optical-history variants. These templates are constructed using Pythonstyle string formatting, where placeholders in curly For instance, braces ({}) mark semantic slots. {task_description} denotes the task definition, and {current_observation} indicates the immediate environmental feedback. These slots are populated with dynamic content during training.

C. Case Study We present the complete trajectory of multi-turn interaction between the agent and the search tool, and demonstrate the reasoning behavior of AgentOCR trained by GRPO. As shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, the agent progressively accumulates search results in its optical memory and adaptively adjusts compression factors at each step. The agent successfully retrieves relevant information across multiple search iterations and arrives at the correct answer while maintaining efficient token usage through visual history compression. 20 AgentOCR: Reimagining Agent History via Optical Self-Compression Prompt Template of Text Agent on ALFWorld You are an expert agent operating in the ALFRED embodied Environment.
