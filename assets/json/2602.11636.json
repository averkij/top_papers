            "content": "Corresponding author. datasets often contain substantial redundancy, where many samples are highly overlapping in content or supervision and contribute limited marginal gains while incurring significant computational cost. This motivates the need for effective data selection methods that can identify compact subset of samples, enabling efficient training while maintaining the competitive performance of full fine-tuning. To address data selection, number of existing approaches adopt training-based or gradient-based strategies. Training-based methods [5, 32, 34, 46] typically rely on warm-up training or training proxy model to estimate sample importance, while gradient-based methods [35, 50] require backpropagation through the target model to measure the influence of samples. Although effective in certain settings, these approaches inevitably introduce additional training procedures and computational overhead, partially conflicting with the original goal of data selection. Moreover, the reliance on proxy models or auxiliary training stages complicates deployment and limits scalability, especially for large-scale multimodal datasets. As result, there has been growing interest in training-free data selection methods that aim to avoid the high computational cost associated with training or backpropagation while still preserving model performance. Existing training-free multimodal data selection methods [3, 14, 17, 42] often rely on the similarity-related metrics between sample representations. Despite efficiency advantages, they often suffer from limitations in how sample representations are constructed. Many approaches either rely on external proxy models or datasets, such as CLIP-based visual representations, or aggregate all visual tokens from the target model to form sample representation. These strategies are largely instruction-agnostic: they treat visual content independently of the accompanying textual instruction. However, in visual instruction tuning, the semantic meaning of sample is largely conditioned on the instruction. The same image may require attention to entirely different visual regions under different instructions. By indiscriminately aggregating all visual tokens without considering instruction relevance, existing methods risk mixing instruction-relevant and irrelevant information, resulting in sample representations failing to distinguish such cases effectively. Another fundamental limitation shared by many prior methods lies in their local perspective on data selection. Most existing approaches [3, 14, 17, 32, 42] rely on pairwise comparisons between samples, such as similarity computation, clustering, or influence. While these local criteria encourage selecting samples that are different from one another, they do not explicitly account for the global structure of the dataset. Selecting samples that are locally diverse does not necessarily ensure that the overall representation space is well preserved. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons inevitably incur at least quadratic time complexity, posing significant scalability bottleneck for large datasets. In this work, we propose fundamentally different perspective on multimodal data selection by adopting global, subspaceoriented view. Instead of reasoning about relationships between individual samples, we focus on the contribution of each sample to the representation space of the entire dataset, i.e., the space spanned by the full dataset representations. This perspective builds on the observation that, under large-scale VIT, the induced representation space is often highly redundant and approximately low-rank, with most meaningful variability concentrated in small number of dominant directions. Accordingly, we aim to select subset of samples whose representations can best span and approximate the dominant subspace of the original representation space. From this perspective, data selection can be viewed as form of subspace compression in representation space: the goal is to identify compact subset that preserves the datasets essential global structure under low-rank view, such that training on the subset remains close to training on the full data. This global formulation eliminates the need for pairwise comparisons and enables scalable data selection. Based on this insight, we introduce ScalSelect, scalable and training-free multimodal data selection method. ScalSelect constructs sample representations directly from the target model by leveraging instruction-conditioned attention signals in the first transformer layer of the LLM, capturing instruction-relevant visual information while suppressing irrelevant content. To select informative samples, ScalSelect estimates the dominant representation subspace and scores samples by their contributions to this subspace, selecting compact subset with linear-time scalability with respect to the number of samples and without proxy models or datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures, datasets, selection budgets, and evaluation benchmarks show that ScalSelect can match full-data training closely using only small fraction of the data. Under 16% selection budget, ScalSelect achieves over 97.50% of the performance of full-data training on LLaVA-Vicuna7B across two datasets, and even surpasses full-data training on Qwen3-VL models in our experiments. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: Instruction-Conditioned Early Representation is introduced to construct sample representations by extracting instructionrelevant visual features from the first LLM transformer layer of the target VLM, enabling instruction-aware modeling. Subspace-Aware Global Selection is proposed as global data selection perspective that prioritizes preserving the dominant representation subspace rather than relying on local, sample-to-sample relationships. ScalSelect is developed as scalable training-free selection method with linear-time complexity, avoiding pairwise comparisons, proxy models, and additional training procedures. Extensive empirical studies, including cross-model and crossdataset evaluations, selection budget scaling, ablation studies, and representation-level analyses, systematically validate the effectiveness, robustness, and key design choices of ScalSelect."

            "content": "Instruction Tuning. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress by combining pretrained large language models with visual encoders, enabling models to perform various visual-language tasks. Early works, such as CLIP [39] and ALIGN [15], pioneered large-scale contrastive learning to align visual features with textual representations in shared latent space. Recently, visual instruction tuning (VIT) [25, 27, 54] has advanced VLMs by fine-tuning them with large-scale image-instruction pairs, enabling models to follow natural language instructions for visual inputs. Pioneering models like LLaVA [27], LLaVA-1.5 [25], and MiniGPT-4 [55] established the feasibility of following complex human intentions by VIT. This trajectory has been further advanced by diverse architectures, including Qwen3-VL [2], LLaVA-NeXT [26], and DeepSeek-VL2 [47]. Moreover, specialized models have pushed the boundaries in niche domains [4, 6, 22], such as DeepSeek-OCR [44] for document intelligence and LLaVA-Med [18] for biomedicine. However, VIT faces challenges in terms of computational efficiency, as full fine-tuning on large datasets is expensive, and many samples in these datasets contribute redundantly to performance. This has led to the exploration of multimodal data selection to reduce computational costs while largely preserving model performance."

            "content": "Instruction Tuning. Multimodal data selection aims to identify informative subsets of image-instruction pairs for visual instruction tuning (VIT), reducing training cost while retaining most of the performance of full fine-tuning. Early approaches primarily rely on simple heuristics, such as random sampling, instruction length, or perplexity-based filtering [38], which are computationally cheap but largely task agnostic. More recent work has explored training-based [5, 32, 34, 46] and gradient-based [35, 50] selection methods, which estimate sample importance via warm-up training, proxy models, or gradient backpropagation through the target model. While effective in some settings, these approaches introduce additional training stages, incur substantial computational overhead, and suffer from limited scalability on large multimodal datasets. To overcome these issues, growing line of research focuses on training-free data selection methods [3, 14, 17, 30, 42, 51] that operate on pretrained representations without explicit training or backpropagation. However, existing training-free methods rely on external proxy encoders, construct instruction-agnostic sample representations, or depend on pairwise similarity computations, leading to representation mismatch, limited instruction awareness, and quadratic complexity. For example, COINCIDE [17] selects samples based on clustering and similarity but relies on proxy encoders and pairwise comparisons. PRISM [3] depends on similarity computations with quadratic complexity. RDS+ [14] achieves linear-time selection but assumes access to an auxiliary proxy dataset that matches the evaluation distribution, which may not hold in practice. These limitations highlight the need for more scalable and representation-faithful training-free data selection strategies for visual instruction tuning. Figure 1: Overview of ScalSelect. (Left) For each sample, the target VLM extracts instruction-conditioned early representations by aggregating the visual tokens that are most attended by the user instruction tokens in the first layer of the LLM, yielding compact sample representation. (Right) The representations of all samples are stacked into representation matrix, from which ScalSelect identifies the dominant low-rank subspace of the full representation space (the space spanned by the full dataset representations). Each sample is scored according to its contribution to this dominant subspace, producing an importance score distribution from which compact subset of informative samples is selected."

            "title": "Representation",
            "content": "A growing body of representation learning related work [10, 23, 41, 53] suggests that the early transformer layers of the LLM play critical role in cross-modal alignment. For example, Align-KD [10] empirically shows that the first LLM layer primarily aligns text and visual hidden states into shared representation space, while the final layer projects representations into the output space. Other works [23, 53] reveal that, in the early LLM layers, visual information is predominantly injected into textual representations, and visual tokens receive the highest attention weights, after which their attention rapidly diminishes to negligible levels. Taken together, these empirical observations suggest consistent layer-wise 3 tendency in VLMs: early LLM layers tend to extract instructionrelevant visual information, the middle layers are more involved in text-dominant reasoning, and the final layer primarily maps the fused representation to the output space. In addition, for the same image, different instructions can induce the model to attend to entirely different visual regions and semantic attributes. Consequently, treating visual representations independently of the instruction, as adopted by many existing data selection methods, fails to account for the diversity introduced by varying textual instructions. This motivates us to condition sample representations on the input instruction when characterizing their contribution to the global representation space. Motivated by these findings, we construct our sample representations from the first transformer layer of the LLM, where crossmodal alignment is most prominent, visual tokens receive the highest attention, and visual representations are already conditioned on the input instruction. Specifically, let the original dataset to be selected be denoted as 𝐷 = {𝑠1, . . . , 𝑠𝑁 }, where each sample , 𝐴𝑇𝑖 𝑖 } consists of the visual input 𝑉𝑖 and 𝑠𝑖 = {𝑉𝑖, 𝑈 1 the 𝑇𝑖 -turn conversation. Each conversation round {𝑈 𝑡 𝑖 } corresponds to the user instruction 𝑈 𝑡 𝑖 and the assistant response 𝐴𝑡 𝑖 at turn 𝑡 {1, . . . ,𝑇𝑖 }. For each sample 𝑠𝑖 𝐷, the visual input is encoded and projected into the LLM hidden space, while the text input is tokenized and embedded into the same space: 𝑖 , . . . , 𝑈 𝑇𝑖 𝑖 , 𝐴1 𝑖 , 𝐴𝑡 𝑖 {𝑣 1 {𝑢𝑡,1 𝑖 {𝑎𝑡,1 𝑖 𝑖 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑁𝑣 𝑖 , . . . , 𝑢𝑡,𝑁 𝑡 𝑖 , . . . , 𝑎𝑡,𝑁 𝑡 𝑖 𝑎 𝑢 } Proj(VE(𝑉𝑖 )), } Emb(Tok(𝑈 𝑡 } Emb(Tok(𝐴𝑡 𝑖 )), 𝑖 )), (1) where VE() denotes the visual encoder, Proj() denotes the projector, Tok() and Emb() denote the tokenizer and embedding layers of the LLM, respectively. {𝑣 𝑗 𝑖 }𝑁𝑣 𝑗=1 denotes the sequence of visual 𝑁 𝑡 𝑁 𝑡 token embeddings, while {𝑢𝑡,𝑗 𝑗=1 and {𝑎𝑡,𝑗 𝑎 𝑢 𝑖 } 𝑖 } 𝑗=1 denote the token embeddings of the user instruction and assistant response at turn 𝑡, respectively. At the first transformer layer of the LLM, multi-head self-attention is applied over the concatenated sequence of visual and textual tokens. Let 𝑄 (1), 𝐾 (1) R𝐿𝑑ℎ denote the query and key matrices at this layer, where 𝐿 is the total number of tokens in the input sequence and 𝑑ℎ is the hidden dimension of each attention head. For single attention head, the attention matrix is computed as (1) = softmax (cid:32) 𝑄 (1)𝐾 (1) 𝑑ℎ (cid:33) , (2) where (1) R𝐿𝐿 encodes post-softmax attention scores between all token pairs, and the entry (1) [𝑝, 𝑞] represents the attention score from the 𝑝-th token to the 𝑞-th token in the input sequence. In the multi-head setting, we average the attention matrices across all heads. Based on the head-averaged attention matrix, we compute the aggregated attention score received by each visual token 𝛼 𝑗 𝑖 (𝑗 {1, . . . , 𝑁𝑣 }) from all user instruction tokens: 𝛼 𝑗 𝑖 = 𝑇𝑖 𝑁 𝑡 𝑢 𝑡 = 𝑚=1 Attn(1) (𝑢𝑡,𝑚 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 𝑖 ), (3) where Attn(1) (, ) denotes the attention score from user instruction token to visual token in the head-averaged attention matrix of the first transformer layer. We then sort the visual tokens in descending order of their aggregated attention scores and select tokens from top to bottom until their cumulative attention reaches threshold 𝜏 (0, 1) of the total attention. For each sample 𝑠𝑖 𝐷, the selected visual tokens form the set of the most attended visual tokens, denoted as V𝑖 : V𝑖 = arg minV 𝑖 {𝑣1 𝑖 ,...,𝑣𝑁𝑣 𝑖 } 𝑖 s.t. 𝛼 𝑗 𝑖 𝜏 𝑣 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖 𝑁𝑣 𝑗=1 𝛼 𝑗 𝑖 . (4) We find that the selection remains stable when the attention-mass threshold 𝜏 varies within reasonable range (e.g., 0.850.95; see Appendix B). We therefore use 𝜏 = 0.9 by default for good trade-off between compactness and coverage. Finally, we average the hidden states of the selected visual tokens at the first transformer layer to obtain the representation of sample 𝑠𝑖 : x𝑖 = 1 V𝑖 LLM(1) (𝑣 𝑗 𝑖 ), (5) 𝑣 𝑗 𝑖 V𝑖 where LLM(1) () denotes the output hidden state of the first transformer layer."

            "content": "To this end, we adopt leverage-score-based row selection strategy inspired by CUR matrix decompositions [7, 37]. CUR decomposition approximates matrix by selecting subset of its rows and columns such that the selected rows and columns capture the dominant low-rank structure of the original matrix. Given the attentionconditioned sample representations {x1, . . . , x𝑁 } obtained in Section 3.1, we stack all sample representations into matrix: = [x1; x2; . . . ; x𝑁 ] R𝑁 𝑑, (6) where each row of is sample representation. We first perform column-wise centering on to obtain X𝑐 . We then estimate the dominant low-rank structure of X𝑐 via truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) [43], focusing only on the leading singular components: X𝑐 U𝑘 Σ𝑘 𝑘 , (7) where Σ𝑘 = diag(𝜎1, . . . , 𝜎𝑘 ) R𝑘 𝑘 , and U𝑘 = [𝒔1, . . . , 𝒔𝑘 ] R𝑁 𝑘 . Here, {𝜎1, . . . , 𝜎𝑘 } (𝜎1 𝜎2 . . . 𝜎𝑘 0) denote the top-𝑘 singular values of X𝑐 , and {𝒔1, . . . , 𝒔𝑘 } are the corresponding left singular vectors. For truncated SVD, we select the smallest 𝑘 such that the cumulative energy of the top-𝑘 singular values reach 90% of the total spectral energy (following common practice [1, 8, 13, 37] in lowrank approximation, we set the energy threshold to 90% throughout this work): 𝑘 = arg min𝑘 {1,...,𝑟 } 𝑘 s.t. 𝑘 𝑗=1 𝜎 2 𝑗 90% 𝑟 𝑗= 𝑗 , 𝜎 2 (8) where 𝑟 = rank(X𝑐 ) is the rank of X𝑐 , and 𝑘 denotes the dimensionality of the selected low-rank subspace, corresponding to the minimum number of dominant singular components required to explain 90% of the total spectral energy. 4 After that, we calculate an importance score (statistical leverage score) for each row of X𝑐 (i.e., each sample): 𝜋𝑖 = (cid:16) 𝑖 𝑗 𝒔 (cid:17) 2 , 𝑘 𝑗=1 (9) where 𝑖 {1, . . . , 𝑁 }, and 𝒔𝑖 𝑗 is the 𝑖-th element of the 𝑗-th left singular vector of X𝑐 . The importance score has natural meaning: the statistical leverage or influence of the row on the best lowrank fit of matrix X𝑐 . Finally, after obtaining the importance score for each sample, we select the top-ranked samples according to their importance scores to form the final subset. Overall, by prioritizing samples with the highest statistical leverage, the subset preserves most of the information relevant to reconstructing the best rank-𝑘 approximation of the original representation matrix. In this sense, our method achieves effective representational compression, retaining the dominant structural information of the original data."

            "content": "Scalability of ScalSelect. In the Attention-Conditioned Early Representation stage, each sample requires only single forward pass, and the method relies solely on the attention scores and hidden states from the first transformer layer of the LLM. Therefore, the time complexity of this stage is 𝑂 (𝑁 ). In the Subspace-Aware Global Selection stage, the overall time complexity mainly consists of the following components: 1) Performing truncated SVD on the representation matrix X𝑐 , which computes only the top-𝑘 singular components U𝑘 R𝑁 𝑘 and Σ𝑘 R𝑘 𝑘 . This step costs 𝑂 (𝑁𝑑𝑘) time. 2) Computing the importance scores, which has complexity of 𝑂 (𝑁 𝑘). Since the representation dimension 𝑑 𝑁 is fixed by the model architecture and the subspace dimensionality 𝑘 𝑑 𝑁 is consistently small in practice (e.g., 𝑘 = 9 for LLaVA-V-625K as presented in Section 5.4), the overall selection process scales linearly with the dataset size 𝑁 . Scalability Comparison with Other Methods. Existing multimodal data selection methods based on training or gradients depend on proxy training or gradient backpropagation, introducing additional training and considerable computational overhead. Among training-free methods, several approaches depend on computing pairwise similarities or influence scores between samples, resulting in quadratic time complexity 𝑂 (𝑁 2) and limited scalability. Among recent training-free methods, COINCIDE [17] has time complexity of 𝑂 (cid:0)𝐾𝑁 + (cid:205)𝐶𝑖 2(cid:1), when the sample number in each cluster 𝐶𝑖 is balanced, its complexity reduces to 𝑂 (𝐾𝑁 + 𝑁 2/𝐾); however, it still relies on proxy model. PRISM [3] computes pairwise similarities between samples, leading to quadratic time complexity of 𝑂 (𝑁 2). RDS+ [14] achieves linear-time complexity, but relies on strong assumption that proxy dataset sharing the same data distribution as the evaluation set is available, which is unrealistic in practice and may introduce distribution bias. Overall, compared with these methods, ScalSelect achieves linear-time complexity in training-free manner, without relying on any external models or proxy datasets, demonstrating clear advantages in scalability."

Table 1 compares ScalSe-\nlect with a range of representative baselines on LLaVA-V-625K un-\nder a fixed 100K selection budget. We observe that simple heuristic\nmethods, including Length and Perplexity, consistently underper-\nform Random sampling across most benchmarks, indicating that\ninstruction length or perplexity alone is insufficient for identifying\nimportant training samples, and tend to induce skewed and less\ninformative sample compositions. COINCIDE exhibits mixed perfor-\nmance across benchmarks, achieving competitive results on some\nevaluation tasks (e.g., MMBench) while showing clear weaknesses\non MME-C and POPE-P. This pattern indicates that emphasizing\ninstance-level diversity can benefit MMBench, but may come at the\ncost of degraded reasoning robustness. On another broad-coverage\nbenchmark, MME, ScalSelect significantly outperforms COINCIDE,\nachieving a substantially higher score on MME-C while maintaining\ncompetitive performance on MME-P. These results reveal a trade-\noff between performance on different broad-coverage benchmarks,\nsuch as MMBench and MME, reflecting different emphases on\nmodel capability. Furthermore, ScalSelect consistently outperforms\nall baselines on MME-C, AI2D, and OCRBench, and matches or\nslightly surpasses Full-Finetune on MME-C and POPE-P. ScalSelect\nalso achieves a clear advantage on OCRBench, demonstrating its\neffectiveness on tasks requiring fine-grained, instruction-relevant\nvisual attention (see Section 5.4 for further analysis). Overall, under\nthe 100K selection budget, ScalSelect achieves the highest average\nrelative performance among all evaluated methods, reaching 97.85%\nof Full-Finetune performance. These results suggest that ScalSelect\noffers a favorable balance between scalability and effectiveness\nunder limited data budgets.",

As the number of selected samples increases from 50K to 400K, the performance consistently improves across most benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stability of ScalSelect under varying selection budgets. With only 50K selected samples, ScalSelect already retains over 95% of the Full-Finetune performance on average. Notably, when selecting 300K samples (less than half of the full dataset), ScalSelect attains performance that is nearly on par with Full-Finetune, achieving 99.66% relative performance. With 400K selected samples, ScalSelect surpasses Full-Finetune with relative performance of 101.16%, and achieves comparable or better results on most benchmarks, demonstrating that effective data selection can mitigate redundancy and improve training efficiency. In addition, we observe an apparent trade-off between MME-P and MME-C. Specifically, as the number of selected samples grows from 50K to 300K, performance on MME-P consistently improves, while performance on MME-C shows mild decline. At 400K, the two metrics become more balanced. This observation indicates that different evaluation aspects may respond differently to the selection budget, highlighting the importance of balancing perceptual and cognitive performance."

Performance Across Different Datasets. Table 4 presents the performance of ScalSelect with LLaVA-Vicuna-7B across different datasets, including LLaVA-V-625K and LRV-Sub-180K, under the same selection budget of 16%. On both datasets, ScalSelect consistently outperforms Random sampling and achieves performance close to Full-Finetune. Notably, on LRV-Sub-180K, ScalSelect with only 29K selected samples attains 97.51% of the Full-Finetune performance, surpassing Random sampling by clear margin. These results suggest that ScalSelect generalizes well across datasets with different instruction styles and data distributions. Performance Under Different Projector Freezing Settings. Table 5 compares ScalSelect under two commonly used visual instruction tuning paradigms: freezing the projector and fine-tuning only the LLM, or fine-tuning both the LLM and the projector. Overall, the performance differences between the two settings are relatively small across different selection budgets. This indicates that ScalSelect is robust to different projector freezing strategies and can be effectively applied under both mainstream visual instruction tuning paradigms."

            "content": "Influence of Column-Wise Centering. We further investigate the impact of column-wise centering by comparing ScalSelect with ScalSelect-NoCenter, where centering is not applied before subspace decomposition. As shown in Table 6, removing column-wise centering leads to significant performance degradation, with the selected subspace dimensionality collapsing to 𝑘 = 1. This behavior suggests that, without centering, the mean component of the representation matrix dominates the variance structure. As result, the leading singular vector primarily captures the global mean of the representations, while meaningful variations among samples are largely suppressed. Consequently, the principal components tend to be absorbed by the mean, effectively flattening the representation space and diminishing sample diversity.

This leads to richer and more expressive subspace with higher effective dimensionality, which in turn supports more reliable importance estimation and improved selection performance. Influence of LLM Layer Selection. We study the effect of LLM layer selection by constructing sample representations from different transformer layers, including the first layer, middle layer (the 16th layer), and the penultimate layer. For the deep setting, we use the penultimate layer instead of the final layer, as the last layer is typically more specialized toward output generation and may discard fine-grained representational information [9]. As shown in Table 7, using hidden states from the middle layer leads to the worst overall performance. This suggests that intermediate layers may place less emphasis on fine-grained visual grounding and instead focus more on abstract or mixed-modal representations, making them less suitable for sample representation in data selection. Using hidden states from the deep layer improves performance on OCRBench, even surpassing the first-layer setting. This observation suggests that later LLM layers may encode more detailed or layout-sensitive visual cues that are beneficial for OCR-related tasks, which is consistent with prior empirical findings [48, 49]. Overall, extracting hidden states from the first transformer layer yields the best and most balanced performance across benchmarks. We also observe that the selected subspace dimensionality 𝑘 increases substantially when using deeper LLM layers, indicating more complex and less compressible representation space compared to early layers. This result suggests that early LLM layers capture informative cross-modal interactions and provide stable and effective basis for sample representation and data selection. Probing the Distribution of Importance Scores. We further examine the distribution of the importance scores produced by ScalSelect. As shown in Figure 2, the scores exhibit highly skewed, long-tailed distribution: small fraction of samples contributes disproportionately to the dominant representation subspace, while the majority of samples have negligible leverage. In addition, the ranking curve exhibits sharp initial drop followed by long, Figure 2: Distribution of Importance Scores. Left: Histogram of importance scores, exhibiting highly skewed, long-tailed distribution. Right: Ranking curve of importance scores sorted in descending order, exhibiting sharp initial drop followed by long, gradually decaying tail. gradually decaying tail, indicating that few top-ranked samples dominate the contribution, while importance decreases steadily over the remaining samples. This suggests that ScalSelect supports stable and robust selection across wide range of selection budgets. This observation is consistent with the empirical trends reported in Section 5.2."

Experiment Details A.1 Settings of Extracting Representation For Instruction-Conditioned Early Representation, we perform inference using the target VLM with maximum context length (max_len) of 4096 tokens. For LLaVA-Vicuna-7B, input images are processed following the default configuration of LLaVA-1.5, with fixed resolution of 336 336. For Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct and Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct, input images are resized such that the maximum number of visual tokens does not exceed 576, with patch resolution of 32 32. A.2 Training Hyperparameters All experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB) using LLaMA-Factory. The detailed training hyperparameters are summarized in Table 8. The same training configuration is used across all models, datasets, and selection budgets to ensure fair comparison. Hyperparameter Value Batch size per device Gradient accumulation steps Learning rate (LR) LR schedule LR warmup ratio Weight decay Epoch DeepSpeed stage Cut length 4 2 2e-5 Cosine decay 0.03 0 1 3 Table 8: Training Hyperparameters. Sensitivity of the Attention-Mass Threshold We further analyze the effect of the attention-mass threshold 𝜏 used in the Instruction-Conditioned Early Representation. Table 9 reports the average retained visual token ratio and the overall relative performance under different values of 𝜏 {0.85, 0.90, 0.95}, conducted on LLaVA-Vicuna-7B using the LLaVA-V-625K dataset. As 𝜏 increases, the proportion of retained visual tokens grows gradually, resulting in diminishing marginal gains in token reduction. Meanwhile, the overall relative performance remains stable across this range, with only minor variations. These results indicate that the attention-mass threshold primarily affects representation compactness rather than introducing strong performance sensitivity. Based on this observation, we fix 𝜏 = 0.9 as reasonable default choice that balances visual coverage and representation compactness throughout this work. 𝜏 0.85 0.90 0.95 Retained visual token ratio Rel. 77.8% 84.6% 92.0% 99.26% 100.00% 99.33% Table 9: Retained visual token ratio and overall relative performance under different attention-mass thresholds 𝜏. A.3 Settings of Baselines All baseline methods included in our experiments are applied by following the original experimental settings and implementation details described in their respective papers."

            "content": "We analyze the subspace approximation property of the selected subset in ScalSelect. All notations follow Section 3 of the main paper. Proposition (Relative-Error Subspace Approximation, Sampling Reference) Let X𝑘 denote the best rank-𝑘 approximation of the full representation matrix X𝑐 . Let X𝑆 be the submatrix formed by the samples selected according to leverage scores. If samples are selected via randomized leverage-score sampling, then, with probability at least 99%: X𝑐 𝑃X𝑆 X𝑐 𝐹 (1 + 𝜀) X𝑐 X𝑘 𝐹 , (10) where 𝑃X𝑆 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the row space of X𝑆 , and 𝜀 (0, 1) is an accuracy parameter controlling the approximation slack. with the standard 𝑂 (𝑘 log 𝑘/𝜀2) oversampling rate) yields, with probability at least 99% [7, 37]: 𝐴 𝑃 C𝐴𝐹 (1 + 𝜀) 𝐴 𝐴𝑘 𝐹 . Finally, mapping back to our notation, the sampled columns of 𝐴 = 𝑋 𝑐 correspond to the sampled rows forming 𝑋𝑆 , and 𝑃 corresponds to 𝑃𝑋𝑆 . Using the invariance of the Frobenius norm under transposition, we obtain (11) 𝑋𝑐 𝑃𝑋𝑆 𝑋𝑐 𝐹 = 𝐴 (𝑃 C𝐴) 𝐹 = 𝐴 𝑃 C𝐴𝐹 (1 + 𝜀) 𝐴 𝐴𝑘 𝐹 = (1 + 𝜀) 𝑋𝑐 𝑋𝑘 𝐹 , (12) which completes the proof. Proof. We adapt the relative-error analysis for leverage-score (subspace) sampling in CUR/CX decompositions [7, 37]. Let 𝐴 = 𝑐 R𝑑 𝑁 . Selecting subset of samples (rows) from 𝑋𝑐 is equiv𝑋 alent to selecting the corresponding subset of columns from 𝐴. Let 𝐴𝑘 be the best rank-𝑘 approximation of 𝐴, and let 𝑃 denote the orthogonal projector onto the span of the sampled columns of 𝐴 (equivalently, the span of the sampled rows of 𝑋𝑐 ). By leveragescore sampling (i.e., sampling proportional to the squared ℓ2-norms of the rows of the top-𝑘 right singular vector matrix of 𝐴), the relative-error CX guarantee states that, for any accuracy parameter 𝜀 (0, 1), sampling sufficiently large number of columns (e.g., Remark on Deterministic Selection. The relative-error bound stated above follows the classical analysis of randomized leverage-score sampling in CUR/CX decompositions [7, 37], and serves as theoretical reference for the design of ScalSelect. In practice, leverage scores are commonly used as deterministic importance measure, and we accordingly adopt deterministic top-leverage selection strategy by selecting the highest-scoring samples, well-established heuristic motivated by leverage-score sampling theory that improves stability by removing randomness [7, 36]. The above result provides theoretical motivation for using leverage scores as principled criterion for sample selection."
