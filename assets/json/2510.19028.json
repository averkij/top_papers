            "content": "LLMs increasingly operate as agents in everyday settings (e.g., classrooms, workplaces), and such interactions between LLM agents and humans are expected to grow (Cai et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). To provide appropriate assistance, LLMs should understand human dynamics and infer participant relationships from sociolinguistic cues, much as humans do when navigating social interactions (Sehl et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2016). We refer to this social reasoning ability as social relationship reasoning, which includes identifying who holds authority, who is peer, family member, or stranger in conversation. If LLMs fail at this reasoning, they risk producing responses Equal Contribution. 1The dataset and code are available on https://github. com/rladmstn1714/SCRIPTS. that violate social norms and/or cause safety issues (e.g., privacy leakage (see Figure 1)). Despite its importance and relevance in everyday life, existing evaluations of social relationship reasoning have major shortcomings. Prior works often oversimplify the task, frame it as multiplechoice classification (Jia et al., 2021a; Li et al., 2023), cover narrow set of relationship types (often around ten) (Jia et al., 2021b; Tigunova et al., 2021), or focus exclusively on simple dyadic conversations (Jurgens et al., 2023). More importantly, these frameworks ignore the inherent uncertainty of social reasoning, which rarely yields single definitive answer. For example, remark like You never listen to me could signal playful banter between friends, frustration between coworkers, or deeper tension in romantic relationship, depending on the context and the participants. Such interpretations may further diverge across languages and cultures, underscoring the need for more robust evaluation frameworks. To explore this topic further, we introduce SCRIPTS, novel benchmark for evaluating LLMs social relationship reasoning abilities, featuring an answer schema that incorporates inherent uncertainty (Figure 1). It contains 1k dialogues (English 580, Korean 567), derived from U.S. and Korean movie scripts, ensuring conversations are realistic and culturally grounded. We adopt soft labeling, where each relationship type is annotated with likelihood-based categories: HIGHLY LIKELY, LESS LIKELY, UNLIKELY. By distinguishing relationship labels by likelihood, our dataset supports fine-grained evaluation that differentiates nonsensical responses from plausible but contextually less prominent ones. We evaluate 9 models and find that current LLMs perform poorly on social relationship reasoning regardless of the language. The models frequently select UNLIKELY relationships, indicating inappropriate inferences about the social sitFigure 1: Illustration of SCRIPTS and potential risks from failures in Social Relationship Reasoning. SCRIPTS provides three human-annotated relationship labels: HIGHLY LIKELY, LESS LIKELY, and UNLIKELY. In this example, Gemini-2.5-Flash incorrectly predicts store clerk-customer relationship as mother-child. Such misleading relational reasoning can lead to inappropriate responses and unsafe decisions, such as privacy leakage. Examples are from Korean dialogues, translated into English. uations. Even the best-performing model (GPT4o) still produces UNLIKELY responses in 10% of cases, settles on LESS LIKELY responses in 11%, and predicts HIGHLY LIKELY relationships in 79% of cases. Lower-performing models, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieve HIGHLY LIKELY predictions in only 45% of cases. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and thinking models, effective for logical reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. We qualitatively analyze where LLMs fail, focusing on cases where models respond with UNLIKELY relationships, and identify four failure modes across English and Korean, often rooted in cultural context. We further investigate whether the socio-demographic backgrounds (e.g., age, gender, relationship), formality, hierarchy and intimacy between human conversational partners enhance social relationship reasoning and find that these factors reduce UNLIKELY outputs and mitigate nonsensical behavior for LLMs in general. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We introduce SCRIPTS, benchmark for evaluating LLMs social relationship reasoning in English and Korean. Evaluation across 9 LLMs reveal their limited social reasoning ability, with models inferring UNLIKELY relationships in 10-25% of cases, and showing substantial variation in their ability to infer HIGHLY LIKELY relationships. We show that CoT reasoning or thinking models do not consistently improve performance. Instead, incorporating relational information that humans naturally rely on facilitate more likely inferences."

            "content": "Evaluating Social Relationship Reasoning in LLMs Recent evaluations of social relationship reasoning in LLMs largely focus on Theory of Mind and inferring mental states (Jung et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2025). While important, this line of work does not evaluate the capacity to integrate social contexts into the reasoning process (Hilton, 1995). Our work addresses complementary but underexplored component of social intelligence: inferring interpersonal relationships that shape interaction, accounting for context, and participants. Existing research on computational models for social relationship reasoning is often constrained by simplified tasks and datasets  (Table 1)  . Many studies frame the problem as classification or multiple-choice, which fails to capture nuanced reasoning process (Li et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2021a; Chen et al., 2020). Some datasets are built from single utterances rather than multi-turn conversations, limiting contextual variation (Jurgens et al., 2023). Other studies using conversational data have methodological limitations. For instance, PRIDE (Tigunova et al., 2021) gathered annotations from movie summaries instead of dialogues, and Rashid and Blanco (2018) used static, Dataset Multi-turn Labeling Strategy Relational Dimensions Fine-grained Relationship Task Languages Rashid and Blanco (2018) Zhan et al.

SCRIPTS supports over 250 fine-grained relationships in dialogues, covers multiple languages, and provides probabilistic labeling and relational dimensions. episode-wide labels that fail to reflect what can be inferred from an interaction. In contrast, our benchmark uses multi-turn dialogues with labels directly inferred by humans, capturing relationships as they actually manifest. We evaluate with open-ended generation rather than fixed-choice classification, allowing wider range of relationships and better reflecting the social complexity. Cultural Dependency in Social Relationship Reasoning social relationship reasoning is tied to linguistic and cultural context. For example, Korean and English are differ typologically and in their use of terms of address and honorifics, which play central role in encoding relational information in Korean dialogue (Chung, 2010; Hwang, 1991). Nevertheless, prior studies typically focus on single language (mostly English). Terms of address (ToA) are words or phrases used to refer directly to another person, carrying important discourse implications (Hwang, 1991). In Korean, these terms are diverse, including kinship terms, titles, pronouns, and other culturally grounded forms. For instance, instead of using an adults name, Korean speakers may prefer Minsoos dad, reflecting norms that avoid direct name use in certain contexts. By contrast, English ToA rely mainly on personal names, with limited titles (Mr., Mrs.), professional markers (Professor), and kinship terms (Mom, Dad). Honorifics are another key site of cultural divergence, encoding social relationships directly into linguistic forms (Ide, 1989). While many languages employ politeness strategies, Korean is distinct in its extensive grammaticalization of honorifics (Harada, 1976; Brown et al., 2014), whereby roles, status, and formality are conveyed through verbal morphology (Fukada and Asato, 2004; Brown, 2015; Pizziconi, 2011). In English, by contrast, no equivalent system exists. Instead, politeness is expressed through speech acts or pragmatic choices. Given these cultural and linguistic differences, social relationship reasoning should be evaluated cross-linguistically and crossculturally. Our study represents first step with dataset spanning two languages and cultures. Evaluating Tasks with Multiple Answers of Varying Plausibility Unlike domains with verifiable answers (e.g. mathematics), social relationship reasoning is inherently subjective (Hilton, 1995), operating on spectrum of plausible interpretations across contexts and participants. robust evaluation should credit likely answers and penalize socially inappropriate ones. Error severity-aware evaluations are common in ambiguous NLP tasks like machine translation (Freitag et al., 2021) and dialogue generation (Zhang et al., 2022), yet remain largely absent in social relationship reasoning. Prior work acknowledges ambiguity by allowing multiple labels (Jurgens et al., 2023; Tigunova et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2020) but does not model their probabilistic nature. We extend these paradigms by separating plausible secondary interpretations from outright failures, enabling more granular evaluation."

            "content": "To capture the complexity and diversity of realworld social dynamics, we leverage movie scripts, which provide natural interactions among humans across wide spectrum of relationships  (Table 9)  . Our benchmark makes two key contributions: It (1) dynamically models how social relationships emerge within conversations, rather than relying on static role labels, and (2) employs three-tiered probabilistic labeling schemeHIGHLY LIKELY, LESS LIKELY, and UNLIKELYenabling more granular evaluation of social relationship reasoning capabilities. Dialogue-Level Labeling key design choice of SCRIPTS is its focus on relationships as manifested within specific conversational contexts. Previous benchmarks often rely on fixed character roles derived from movie metadata (e.g., motherson) (Jia et al., 2021b). However, social relationships are dynamic: speakers may shift roles based on context and/or hold multiple relationships simultaneously. For example, the same conversational partners may interact as friends and as co-workers in different scenes. To validate our context-centric approach, we compare our human-annotated labels against these static movie labels. The comparison reveals two critical findings: (1) 19% of static movie labels are not considered relevant by human annotators for given dialogue, suggesting that single global label can be misleading. (2) Even when the annotator labels include movie label, our annotations contain an average of 3.6 HIGHLY LIKELY relationships per dialogue. This result shows that single conversation often reflects multiple social facets, highlighting the limitations of singlelabel approach and the necessity of contextaware method. Probabilistic Labeling As social situations are inherently ambiguous, one dialogue may suggest multiple relationships with varying plausibility (Figure 1). We adopt three-tier probabilistic schemeHIGHLY LIKELY, LESS LIKELY, and UNLIKELY. This design offers two key benefits: (1) granularity, allowing metrics to reward models for identifying the most salient relation (HIGHLY LIKELY) rather than just plausible ones (LESS LIKELY); and (2) nonsense penalty, which penalizes contextually inappropriate predictions (UNLIKELY)a critical failure in social relationship reasoning."

We recruit 17 annotators for English and 14 annotators for Korean (see Appendix A.5 for details). For human annotation, we employ four-phase annotation process (See Appendix for details). Phase 1: Labeling UNLIKELY Relationships. From predefined list of 50 common relationships from PRIDE (Tigunova et al., 2021) (see Appendix Table 9), annotators select all relationships that are definitively contradicted by the dialogues content. relationship is marked as UNLIKELY only if majority of annotators agree, ensuring high-confidence threshold. Phase 2: Open-ended Labeling for HIGHLY LIKELY Relationships. The annotators then provide open-ended text labels for the relationship(s) that they believe are most clearly demonstrated in the dialogue. After normalization step (e.g., merging co-worker and colleague), the union of the labels forms the HIGHLY LIKELY set. Phase 3: Deriving LESS LIKELY Relationships. All remaining relationships from the prethat are neither HIGHLY LIKELY defined list nor UNLIKELY are automatically categorized as LESS LIKELY. Phase 4: Annotating Auxiliary Labels In this phase, annotators provide auxiliary labels for socio-demographic information (age, gender) and relational dimensions (formality of communication, hierarchy, and intimacy between conversational partners). We collect this information to conduct more detailed analyses of factors that influence relationship inferences; we focus on ones that humans have been shown to rely on for social relationship reasoning (Wish et al., 1981; Nguyen et al., 2016). Quality Control To ensure annotation quality, we conduct initial training sessions and pilot study among the annotators. We exclude dialogues in which the three annotators HIGHLY LIKELY labels had no overlap (i.e., mutually exclusive), as such cases indicate low reliability. This results in total of 1,147 dialogues (580 English, 567 Korean), deleting 13.2% samples from initial dataset. Table 2 shows the statistics of our final dataset."

This implies that languageand culture-specific approach to model training may be beneficial, given the culturally dependent nature of the task. 6https://github.com/SKT-AI/A.X-4.0/ Based on manual analysis of models reasoning processes in CoT experiments ( 4.2), we classify the key failure modes of LLMs into four types.7 Failure to Distinguish Terms of Address and References We find that models often misinterpret term of reference (a word used to refer to someone) as term of address (a word used to call someone directly), leading to fundamental misunderstanding of the social context. Dialogue 1 (English): [A]: Hi Officer, can help you? [B]: Yes, Im hoping you can. An elderly gentleman went missing from the nursing home down the street. Staff seems to think he came here. (...) [A]: (Pause, then) Oh....thats my Dad. He cant talk. Had major stroke few years back. But hes doing well. Aint ya Pop? [B]: OK, well, thanks for your time. Heres my number in case you hear of anything. Sorry to bother you. (...) Ground Truth: Police officerCivilian, Strangers Prediction: ParentChildren / Fatherson (Llama, Gemini, GPT) In Dialogue 1, speaker [A] says, thats my Dad, using Dad as reference to identify third person for the police officer [B]. However, the models latch onto this keyword and misinterpret it as term of address from [A] to [B], leading to the incorrect inference of Parent-Child relationship. This failure leads the models to ignore clear cues (e.g., [B] being called Officer) that contradict this interpretation. In Korean, this type of error is more pronounced because speakers often use addressing terms to refer to themselves. For example, teacher might say, Teacher told you to do this, 7Although analyzing CoT reasoning traces is informative, we acknowledge that they are often unfaithful and may not reflect the models actual reasoning behind its final answer. Failure to Recognize Atypical Relationships Models frequently struggle to recognize relationships that deviate from conventional or stereotypical patterns, such as non-hierarchical (equal) exchanges between parents and children or hierarchical conversation between married couple. Dialogue 3 (English): [A]: So youre seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing? [B]: Yeah. [A]: First time in while. [B]: Yeah, but no biggie. [B]: Hey, whats with the moping? [A]: Nothing. Its just... theres this girl. [B]: Oh yeah? You like her? [A]: like [C]. This girls my soulmate. Im like crazy, stupid, in love with her. And she wants someone else. [B]: But shes your soulmate? [A]: Yeah. Ground Truth: Parent-Children Prediction: Siblings (Llama, GPT, Gemini) In Dialogue 3, all human annotators agree on the parentchild relationship, yet the models reject it: less likely since the conversation feels more peer-like rather than hierarchical or guiding (GPT-4o), the casual tone and discussion about crush imply more peer-like relationship (Qwen-3-8b), and if [B] is the parent, they might not discuss the girl in such casual way (Llama-3.1-8b-instruct). Gemini-2.5flash likewise dismisses the parentchild relationship, reasoning that is bachelor and As parents are deceased, concluding it is not traditional parentchild relationship, revealing stereotyped conception of family roles. Failure to Understand Languageor CultureSpecific Features (Ko) In Korean, this error type accounts for the largest share of failures. Most confusions stem from the misinterpretation of terms of address and honorifics. For example, unlike English, eomeoni, literally mother, can also refer to friends mother or an older woman, yet the model often predicts parentchild relationship whenever it appears. This issue is especially pronounced in dialogues containing culturally specific terms, such as kinship expressions. For instance, Qwen misinterprets Hyungsoo (older brothers wife) as older brother, and Hyungnim as father, resulting in complete relational failure. Honorifics, another cue for social hierarchy, are also frequently misinterpretedfor example, equal relationships (e.g., friendships) predicted as hierarchical, and vice versa. Figure 4: Distribution of GPT-4os 30 failure cases by error type in English and Korean. where Teacher actually refers to oneself. However, the model incorrectly interprets Teacher as third party. Failure to Aggregate Multiple Cues Social reasoning requires the ability to identify multiple cues within the context and integrate them to arrive at conclusion. However, models fail to integrate cues, especially when their combination is atypical. Dialogue 2 (Translated from Korean): (...) [B]: (Salutes) Hey. [C]: Hey. [B]: Hey... Whats this? drowned body? Doesnt even look that deep to me. [A]: Doesnt seem like he drowned. [B]: Then what, dumped body? [A]: Nah... doesnt look dumped either. Go take closer look. Go on. [B]: Then what the hell is it? [A]: Hey B, you know, brace yourself before you look. [B]: You kidding me? Damn it... shit... Ground Truth: Friend/Coworker Prediction: Supervisor-Subordinate GPT) (Qwen, Gemini, In Dialogue 2, GPT-4o identifies three cues: (1) and converse casually without honorifics, (2) the topic concerns work, and (3) complies with As instruction. The model places greatest weight on the last cue, interpreting the interaction as hierarchical and labeling them as supervisorsubordinate. For Korean speakers, this is implausible, since subordinates are expected to use honorifics when addressing superior. The absence of honorifics indicates the relationship is not hierarchical, but rather that of coworkers or friends. This shows that even when the models detect relevant cues, they are unable to prioritize and integrate them. Additionally, we manually examine 30 failure cases of GPT-4o (best performing model), and Figure 4 presents their distribution across error types in English and Korean. In English, the majority of errors arise from Failure to Aggregate Multiple Cues (36.7%). In contrast, Korean errors are predominantly caused by difficulties in handling Languageor Culture-Specific Features (46%), with smaller proportions attributed to the other categories."

            "content": "Information Help? Humans interpret social relationships using demographic cues and relational dimensions (Nguyen et al., 2016). We investigate whether such social information can similarly enhance the social relationship reasoning abilities of LLMs using four modelsGPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash, Qwen-3-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B-instructeach representing different model family while excluding thinkingenabled and Korean-specialized models.8 Specifically, we examine how providing social information influences performance in inferring social relationships, considering two types of information: demographic cues (age, gender) and relational dimensions (intimacy, hierarchy, formality). Experimental Setting We structure six experimental settings with two variables. First, we vary the type of social information: (i) age/gender only, (ii) relational dimensions only, or (iii) both. Second, we vary the source of social information: (a) human-annotated gold data, available in the dataset as metadata (see 3.3.2 for illustration), or (b) model-generated predictions, where the model infers each type of social information and incorporates these predictions into the social relationship reasoning. The accuracy of these predictions is reported in Table 15 in the appendix. Detailed experimental settings, including the prompt, appear in Appendix B.2.3. Results With Ground Truth Labels Table 5 shows GPT-4o results across six settings on the English dataset. Providing human gold information yields no substantial or consistent performance gains, but it reduces the proportion of UNLIKELY predictions. This suggests that while such information may not directly guide identification 8We find that models often rely on relational dimensions when inferring relationships; see Appendix C.1 for examples.

Blue indicates positive change, while Red indicates negative change. of HIGHLY LIKELY relationships, it helps models avoid UNLIKELY ones. The tendency holds across models, except for Qwen-3-8B. For instance, when models initial inference of an UNLIKELY relationship is refined into more plausible one, the label Intimate often shifts toward labels that are typically more intimate: Strangers Romantic Interest (3.3%). Similarly, when given the label No hierarchy, the most common change is also ParentChildren Friends (2.9%). Thus, dimension labels provide additional cues about relationships, enabling the model to incorporate them and reduce implausible predictions. However, these changes do not always yield correct reasoning. Sometimes models over-rely on dimensional labels rather than context. For instance, in an atypical close superiorsubordinate relationship, GPT-4o misinterprets the interaction due to the intimate tone, even when clear terms of address are present. Results With Model-Generated Labels When using model-generated information, the additional labels do not always help, as they are often inaccurateGPT-4o shows lower accuracy than 60% for age and gender inference and less than 75% for relation dimensions inference (Table 15 for detailed accuracy of four models). Specifically, when comparing the accuracy of social information inference, we find that accuracy is higher in cases where additional information improves social relationship reasoning, compared to cases where it leads to deterioration  (Table 6)  . These results suggest that demographic cues and relational dimensions, which humans naturally rely on, can facilitate social relationship reaSHIPS. We find four key failure modes in English and Korean: Models (1) confuse whether an address term refers to the speaker, the addressee, or third party, (2) fail to aggregate multiple contextual cues when they contradict each other, (3) exhibit stereotyping in relational interpretations, failing to recognize beyond typical relationships, and (4) fail to capture culture-specific nuances in social relationship reasoning, which is highly culture-dependent task. Our cross-linguistic results, including improved performance of Koreanspecific models on Korean dataset relative to that in English, demonstrates the importance of languageand culture-specific approaches to advance LLMs social reasoning abilities. We hope that SCRIPTS serves as starting point for exploring how to improve LLMs social relationship reasoning in diverse contexts."

However, current LLMs are limited in their ability to infer these dimensions, and therefore instructing LLMs to infer these factors before identifying the social relationships is ineffective. Results for other models are provided in Table 1314 in the Appendix D. Associations Between Social Information and Social Relationship Reasoning Performance To further examine the link between social information inference and relationship reasoning, we run separate logistic regressions for each factor. Table 7 shows that most factors are positively associated with social relationship reasoning.

            "title": "A Dataset",
            "content": "We source dialogues from movie scripts. The collection process consist of the following steps: (1) movie selection, (2) raw scene collection, (3) OCR processing and human verification, (4) scene filtering (5) anonymization, and (6) relationship annotation. A.1 Movie Selection We select the movies based on the following criteria to capture daily real-life interactions. Only modern-day movies released after 2000 are included, excluding medieval fantasy or alien sci-fi. We consider age limits, only including movies up to PG-13 for English movies and up to 15세 관람 가 (suitable for audiences aged 15 and above) for Korean movies. We collect English movie scripts from IMSDb.9 For Korean movies, due to the limited online dialogue resources, we visited the Korean Film Archive (KOFA)10 to collect physical copies of movie scripts. From KOFA, we only collect onethird of each movie script to adhere to the data use policy. Also, we collect additional movie scripts 9https://imsdb.com 10http://www.kmdb.or.kr/ from Filmmakers Online Community.11 In total, we collect 60 movies (28 English, 32 Korean) across various genres. A.2 Raw Scene Collection and Processing For physical copies of Korean movies from KOFA, we use NAVER CLOVA OCR API to extract dialogue texts.12 After OCR, we use GPT-4o to further process and clean the text into structured format. Human annotators then verify and modify the outputs with the original PDF files. As result, we obtain 16k English and 7k Korean scenes. A.3 Scene Filtering Scenes are filtered to include at least four utterances, and involve two to three speakers. To maximize speaker diversity, we prioritize scenes with unique set of speakers. Using these criteria, we select 1,322 scenes from an initial pool of 23k scenes, comprising 698 English and 624 Korean evaluation sets. The selected movies and the number of scenes per movie are listed in Table 16. A.4 Anonymization To mitigate potential data contamination (e.g., identifying the source movie) and reduce bias 11https://www.filmmakers.co.kr/ 12https://www.ncloud.com/product/aiService/ocr (e.g., gender inference), all character names are automatically replaced with placeholders such as [A] and [B]. Any names not covered by this process are further verified and anonymized manually. A.5 Human Annotation We construct golden answer set with human annotators who have over ten years of experience in the target language and culture. Annotators include undergraduate and graduate students in South Korea and the United States, compensated at 1.5 times the minimum hourly wage in their country. Before annotation, they attend an introductory session covering data usage policies and guidelines. For social relationships, annotators are given an initial set of possible relationships  (Table 9)  , adapted from Tigunova et al. (2021), and asked to mark UNLIKELY ones. To reduce workload, annotators first choose LIKELY relationship categories for each dialogue, then select the UNLIKELY relationships from the list of specific relationships in those categories. They also provide up to five open-ended answers describing relationships that best characterize the interaction. These serve as candidates for LIKELY relationships. For relational dimensions, we provide annotators with definitions of each dimension and ask them to rate dialogues on 5-point scale: intimacy (from strongly intimate to strongly unintimate), formality (from strongly formal to strongly informal), and hierarchy (from AB to AB). When constructing the golden labels, we collapse the ratings into 3-point scale (e.g., intimate, neutral, unintimate) and assign the majority-voted label. The inter-annotator agreement is reported in Table 8. Figure 5 shows the human annotation platform: the anonymized scene appears on the left, and annotation questions on the right. All annotations were conducted with IRB approval. We recruited 17 English annotators (7 male, 10 female) and 14 Korean annotators (5 male, 9 female). All annotators were undergraduate or graduate students enrolled at universities in the United States or Korea. The Korean annotators were all native speakers, while the English annotators were either U.S. citizens or individuals who had lived in the United States for over ten years. For quality control, applicants were asked to complete the task on three sample items during recruitment, and their responses were reviewed by the authors to select the final annotators. After selection, annotators participated in an orientation session and training phase designed to support them in performing the task as effectively as possible. A.6 Diversity of SCRIPTS Figure 6 presents the ten most common relationships in each language. Both the English and Korean datasets frequently include social (e.g., friends, acquaintances), organizational (e.g., coworkers, supervisor-subordinate), and familial (e.g., parent-child, siblings) relationships. Beyond these shared categories, we also examine which relationship types appear exclusively in Korean or English. Each dataset contains culturally specific relationships that reflect distinct social roles and lexicalizations. Korean-only relations include North Korean soldiercitizen (1), shamanclient (2), shaman assistant (1), private tutorstudent (1), and students family acquaintancetutor (1). In addition, kinship terms are more fine-grained in Korean: for example, distinctions such as older brother younger brother (1) and older brothersister-inlaw (1), whereas in English these are typically generalized under single siblings category. English-only relations include roles such as father figurechild, mother figurechild, co-parents, and babysitterchild, reflecting cultural and social roles that are more explicitly lexicalized in English. These findings highlight how cultural context shapes the granularity and salience of social relationships represented in dialogue datasets."

As result, GPT-4o has accurately evaluated in 97.85% of the responses in English and 86.2% in Korean, with an inter-annotator agreement of 96% (Cohens κ = 0.58) between the two authors. B.4 Results See Table 10 for the complete results, Table 11 for results with CoT prompting, and Table 12 for results from Korean-specialized models. reasoning? To understand how models use and integrate cues to infer social relationships, we conduct qualitative analysis on their CoT reasoning. Terms of Address and Reference LLMs frequently leverage terms of address and references as explicit cues to infer social relationships. For instance, when speaker use terms like Daddy or Professor [B], the models infer familybased or professional relationship. Self-reference also provide valuable information. For example, speaker introducing themselves as Doctor [A] signals their professional identity as medical practitioner, leading to LLMs suggesting relationships such as Doctor-Patient or Doctor-Doctor. Furthermore, LLMs analyze how individuals refer to third parties to understand the relationship between the referring individuals themselves. For example, if both and refer to third person as Sergeant [C], the LLM can infer that and are likely colleagues within military context, and that their shared use of formal title suggests potentially task-oriented conversation. Conversation context and background LLMs also take into account the context of the conversation (e.g., school, church, workplace, home). They then utilize this background information to infer the social relationship or level of intimacy between the individuals involved in the dialogue. Tone or Atmosphere LLMs also assess the emotional tone of individuals in dialogue to judge their social dimensions, particularly intimacy and formality, utilizing that information to infer their social relationship. The models often associate casual, friendly, teasing, empathetic, or supportive tones with more intimate relationships Model En Ko High Probable () Impossible () High Probable () Impossible () GPT-4o Gemini-2.5-flash Qwen-3-8b Llama-3.1-8b 0.8024 (0.0114) 0.7412 (-0.0170) 0.6882 (0.1332) 0.5410 (0.0868) 0.0971 (-0.0117) 0.1265 (-0.0289) 0.1513 (-0.1261) 0.2667 (-0.0410) 0.6953 (0.0022) 0.6031 (0.0137) 0.4974 (0.023) 0.2996 (-0.0578) 0.2025 (-0.0162) 0.2010 (-0.1194) 0.3651 (-0.0259) 0.5769 (0.0306) Table 11: Comparison of model performance with Chain of Thought Prompting across English (En) and Korean (Ko) with deltas in parentheses.

Similarly, emotional expressions, whether friendly or hostile, are often connected to informal relationships while the models associate serious, indifferent, dismissive, or emotionally neutral expressions with formal relationships. Relational Dimensions When inferring social relationships, models often consider relational dimensions (intimacy, hierarchy, formality) in their rationale. For instance, in dialogue where playfully jokes with while shares personal concerns, the model infers strong intimacy and suggests close tie such as friendship or siblinghood. However, it is important to note that while using social dimensions as cue, particularly hierarchy, LLMs often reveal social stereotypes, defining typical relational dimensions to certain relationships. For example, models assume that parent-child inherently shares hierarchical relationship while married couple would generally have non-hierarchical(equal) relationship. This lead to failures when the social interaction deviate from these norms, real-life atypical relationships."
