            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-saturation performance on diverse benchmarks such as knowledge quizzes (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2025; Rein et al., 2024), math reasoning tests (Cobbe et al., 2021; Contributors, 2023; Quan et al., 2025), and instruction-following tasks (Jiang et al., 2023; Pyatkin et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2023a). However, these benchmarks are static, evaluating models on fixed inputs with single-turn reasoning. High scores on such tests do not necessarily reflect real-world intelligence, where agents must perceive, act, and adapt through feedback over time. To move beyond static evaluation, recent work has introduced interactive environments that allow LLMs to perform sequential actions and observe feedback (Jimenez et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023c). Examples include web and computer-use agents (He et al., 2024; Koh et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023b), which operate in discrete and deterministic environmentseach action produces predictable transition defined by backend logic. These environments test perception and reasoning, but remain fully controllable and support tree-based searching (Aksitov et al., 2023; Koh et al., 2024b; Putta et al., 2024). In contrast, trading environments represent continuous and autonomous systems. The world evolves independently of the agent, and actions only adjust the agents internal portfolio state 5 2 0 2 5 ] . - [ 1 8 2 6 3 0 . 1 1 5 2 : r LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Table 1: Comparison of LiveTradeBench with existing trading benchmarks. We compare our work with others through four dimensions: (1) sequential decision for whether its current trading actions rely on the previous actions; (2) portfolio management for whether its task is multi-asset portfolio management; (3) live trading for whether the evaluation belongs to backtest with historical market data or live test with real-time streaming data; (4) multi-market evaluation for whether it includes markets beyond the stock market.

Feedback is delayed and noisy, emphasizing adaptation over control. This difference in environment structurefrom deterministic systems to dynamic processesdefines deeper frontier for evaluating LLM agents ability to reason and act in open-ended, real-world settings (Garrido-Merchan et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). Despite this importance, current applications for building LLM-based trading agents remain oversimplified and disconnected from live market dynamics. Specifically, (1) most evaluation frameworks rely on offline backtesting, which is prone to information leakage and fails to capture the uncertainty, volatility, and feedback of real-world environments (Li et al., 2025a,b,c; Papadakis et al., 2025); and (2) most trading agents model trading as low-level local actions (e.g., buy/sell/hold) on single asset, neglecting higher-level reasoning and planning across multiple assets (Briola et al., 2021; Han et al., 2023a,b; Ma et al., 2025). This naturally raises broader question: How can we effectively evaluate the trading ability of LLM-based agents under realistic market conditions at low cost? To answer this question, we introduce LiveTradeBench, live trading environment designed to address both limitations above. (1) LiveTradeBench streams live market data, financial news, and social signals, eliminating the dependence on offline backtesting and thereby avoiding information leakage from the root while capturing real-world uncertainty and feedback. (2) It adopts the portfolio management abstraction, framing trading as strategic allocation process that integrates risk management, temporal reasoning, and decision consistency across multiple assets (Gu et al., 2024; Kou et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024). At each step, the environment exposes dynamic observationsmarket conditions, contextual signals, and the agents historical decisionsand the LLM must output an updated portfolio allocation that balances risk and return over time. By combining live data streaming with portfolio-level reasoning, LiveTradeBench offers realistic, end-to-end platform to evaluate the true trading competence of LLM-based agents under evolving market dynamics. Using this benchmark, we conduct two types of live trading evaluations: stock market (U.S. 2 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models stocks) trading and prediction market (Polymarket*) betting. We compare 21 mainstream LLMs across multiple model families and capability tiers. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) State-of-the-art models in LMArena (Chiang et al., 2024) do not exhibit state-of-the-art trading performancehigh benchmark scores in general reasoning do not translate to superior trading outcomes; (2) LLMs display distinct portfolio management styles, differing in their risk appetite, asset selection patterns, and allocation dynamics; and (3) LLMs can effectively leverage real-time market and news signals to make more informed and adaptive trading decisions. Together, these results reveal disconnect between conventional LLM evaluation and real-world financial competence, motivating the development of more adaptive and robust portfolio management agents. 2. Related Work Evaluation of trading agents The evaluation of LLM-based trading agents generally relies on three types of environments or benchmarks. (1) Backtesting with historical market data is the mainstream approach (Li et al., 2025c; Tang et al., 2025; Tian et al., 2025; Xiao et al., 2024a). However, such evaluations often suffer from information leakage (Li et al., 2025a,d) and poor generalization across longer or multi-regime market periods (Gao et al., 2024a; Jiang and Zhou, 2025). To address these issues, several studies propose data contamination audits, entity anonymization, and temporal de-biasing protocols for fairer backtesting evaluation (He and Xu, 2024; Wu and Zhang, 2025). (2) Market simulators provide an alternative by constructing synthetic or self-designed trading environments (Chen et al., 2023; Emmanoulopoulos et al., 2025; Lopez-Lira, 2025; Papadakis et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a). Yet, these simulators serve mainly as testbeds for behavioral analysis rather than producing realistic trading actions aligned with actual market dynamics. (3) Live evaluation with real-time data represents an emerging direction. While widely explored in other domains such as question answering (Kasai et al., 2022; Nie et al., 2025) and coding (Liang and Zhang, 2024), this approach remains largely unexplored in trading (Li et al., 2025b). Our work focuses on this live evaluation paradigm, which we argue offers the most faithful and future-proof assessment of LLM trading intelligence. Action space design for trading agents The design of trading tasks varies substantially across objectives, which can be formalized through differences in the action space of trading agents. In stock markets, most LLM-based systems adopt single-asset trading formulation, where actions are discrete decisions such as buy, hold, or sell (Gao et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024b, 2025). While intuitive, this setup overlooks cross-asset dependencies and realistic portfolio interactions. Other approaches focus on alpha prediction, producing continuous vectors of alpha signals that represent expected excess returns or relative performance across assets (Heinrich et al., 2021; Islam, 2025; Sun et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2020). However, these signals describe predictions rather than directly executable trading actions. In betting markets, agents often output probability estimates for mutually exclusive outcomes (e.g., Yes vs. No) (DeHaven et al., 2024; Jumadinova and Dasgupta, 2011; Koning and Zijm, 2022), which can be interpreted as implicit portfolio positions in complementary assets. We unify these perspectives under portfolio management framework, where the agent outputs allocation ratios across multiple assets or outcomes (Lucarelli and Borrotti, 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2020). This formulation generalizes discrete trading, alpha prediction, and probabilistic betting within single continuous decision space that naturally emphasizes riskreturn trade-offs and inter-asset correlations. *https://polymarket.com/ 3 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Framework for LLM-based trading agents Various frameworks leverage LLMs to build trading agents in different styles. One line of research focuses on fine-tuning single LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance decision-making and trading performance (Koa et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2025; Zha and Liu, 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). Another line explores multi-agent systems, where agents collaborate or compete through role differentiation to simulate realistic market dynamics (Li and Zhao, 2025; Xu et al., 2024; Zhang and Wang, 2025). In addition, capabilities such as tool use (e.g., API calls, data collectors) (Islam, 2025; Papadakis et al., 2025), self-reflection (Koa et al., 2024), and memory (Li et al., 2024, 2023; Yu et al., 2023) have been recognized as key components for improving trading intelligence. To provide controlled yet extensible setup, we adopt Reactstyle (Yao et al., 2022) framework equipped with tool use and memory as our agent configuration. 3. Building Live Trading Environment for Portfolio Management 3.1. Definition of Portfolio Management Problem definition We formulate the portfolio management task as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) = S, A, O, , Ω, where is the latent market state space, the action space, the observation space, the transition dynamics, and Ω the observation emission function. At each timestep t, the environment is in latent state st S, which encapsulates the true market condition, including asset fundamentals, volatility, liquidity, and other unobserved factors. The agent receives partial observation ot = (qt, pt, ct) = Ω(st), (1) where qt RN denotes the current asset holdings (including cash), pt RN the observable market prices, and ct contextual signals such as news, sentiment, or macro indicators. The total portfolio value is computed as vt = pt. Conditioned on the observation history ot, the agent produces an action at representing target allocation vector, subject to (i) = 1. State transition function The environment transition captures the joint evolution of the market and the agents portfolio.It consists of two coupled processes: an exogenous market-state evolution, governed by real-world dynamics and observable as (pt, ct) (pt+1, ct+1), and an endogenous portfolio adjustment induced by the agents allocation decision at under the new market state, leading to qt qt+1. Concretely, after executing at, the market evolves according to , producing new prices pt+1 and contextual signals ct+1. The portfolio is revalued and rebalanced under the new prices as t+1 = v pt+1, qt+1 = t+1 at pt+1 , vt+1 = t+1pt+1 = t+1 (2) where division is element-wise. The next observation ot+1 is emitted by Ω, capturing the updated portfolio state and market context. Since we focus on highly liquid assets such as Nvidia (NVDA) stocks and trending Polymarket markets to make up the portfolio, the agents individual trades exert negligible influence on real-world prices. This assumption justifies modeling the simulated transition function as closely aligned with the real world. From allocation decisions to executable trading actions At each timestep t, after outputing the allocation decision at, the agent can update its holdings from qt to qt+1 through executable trading actions (BUY/SELL/HOLD). The executed trade vector is defined as qt = qt+1 qt, where 4 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 1: Market selection in LiveTradeBench. The top panels show AAPL in the U.S. stock market (left) and the contract OpenAI has the best AI model by the end of 2025 in the Polymarket prediction market (right). In prediction markets, the price directly reflects the probability of given outcome. Both markets respond to news and historical price trends, but Polymarket exhibits sharper fluctuations, faster reactions, and higher sensitivity to external signals. The bottom panels display representative assets across various domains, including technology, finance, cryptocurrency, manufacturing, and politics. (i) > 0 indicates buying positive (i) shares, and = 0 corresponds to holding the current position. Once these trades are executed, the portfolio transitions to the new holdings qt+1, and the total portfolio value vt+1 is updated according to Eq. 2. This formulation provides direct mapping from the high-level allocation action space to explicit buy, sell, and hold operations, without modeling low-level order execution mechanics. shares of asset i, negative (i) < 0 indicates selling (i) (i) 3.2. Market Selection We evaluate agents in two complementary environments (stock market and prediction market) designed to test their generalization across both structured and information-driven regimes. This dual setup enables comprehensive assessment of whether agents can perform consistently across markets that differ in structure, information flow, and reaction speed. Importantly, these two markets demand distinct strategies and reasoning perspectives for profitability: the stock market rewards longhorizon analysis and disciplined diversification, whereas the prediction market requires short-horizon adaptation and event-driven belief updating. U.S. stock market The U.S. stock market represents mature, institutionally regulated system where asset prices evolve smoothly, exhibit strong cross-sector correlations, and reflect aggregated fundamentals and macroeconomic signals over time. Effective portfolio management in this environment requires capturing long-term dependencies, modeling hidden correlations, and maintaining diversified risk exposure. We construct representative portfolio of 15 equities and ETFs spanning major U.S. sectors to ensure diverse responses to external information and macroeconomic shifts. The portfolio includes technology stocksApple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Meta Platforms (META); financial stocksJPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Visa (V); energy and industrial stocksExxon 5 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 2: Observation and action space for LiveTradeBench. We illustrate examples from both the U.S. stock market and the Polymarket prediction market to demonstrate the observation and action spaces. The observation space consists of three components: the agents position, market prices, and relevant news context. The action space represents the portfolio allocation decisions generated by the agent, which can be directly translated into executable trading actions. Mobil (XOM), Caterpillar (CAT), and Tesla (TSLA); consumer goods stocksProcter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), Amazon (AMZN), and Walmart (WMT); and healthcare stocksJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). In addition, cash asset with constant unit price and zero return rate is included to represent risk-free capital allocation. This composition provides balanced exposure across key sectors in highly liquid and regulated financial environment, and we collect real-time stock prices as the data source for evaluation. Polymarket prediction market In contrast, the Polymarket prediction market is decentralized, sentiment-driven, and characterized by loosely coupled contracts that respond sharply and asynchronously to real-time information. These markets often move more abruptly and less coherently than stocks, reflecting shifts in collective belief rather than fundamentals. As result, effective portfolio management here demands rapid adaptation, event-driven reasoning, and sensitivity to evolving narratives. We continuously track ten active binary prediction markets from Polymarket, focusing on betting markets related to politics, crypto, technology and financesuch as Fed rate hike in 2025?, Tether insolvent in 2025?, U.S. recession in 2025?, and USDT depeg in 2025?. We hypothesize that prediction markets and stock markets respond to the same information with different latency and magnitude: stock markets integrate signals gradually through institutional consensus, while prediction markets react instantly and often overshoot due to speculative sentiment. Together, the two environmentsstructured financial markets and decentralized prediction marketsoffer complementary testbeds for evaluating agents under both stability and uncertainty. 6 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models 3.3. Observation Space At each timestep, the agent receives an observation ot = (qt, pt, ct) that encapsulates the current market condition, external context, and portfolio status. This observation serves as the primary input for the agents decision-making process, integrating quantitative market signals, position information, and qualitative contextual cues. Based on these dynamic inputs, the agent determines its next allocation action, adapting to evolving market trends and external developments. Details on the data collection process of the observation space are available in Appendix S1. Position qt The position observation qt represents the agents current holdings across all assets, including cash. Each component is continuous, non-negative value indicating the number of units (or fraction thereof) of asset currently held in the portfolio. This formulation differs from discrete buy/hold/sell signals used in traditional trading formulations and instead provides finegrained representation of continuous capital allocation. The non-negativity constraint ensures that the agent cannot take short positions, reflecting realistic market restrictions and emphasizing capital distribution among long-only assets. (i) Market price pt The price observation includes the latest asset prices and corresponding timestamps for all instruments in the portfolio. For the stock market, pt contains closing prices of the 15 selected equities; for the prediction market, it includes the real-time trading prices of 10 trending Polymarket markets. These values serve as the direct basis for portfolio valuation and allocation updates, enabling the agent to track how asset values evolve over time. Market context ct The contextual observation ct mainly provides real-time market news. We collect recent articles from Google News using assetand topic-specific keywords (e.g., Federal Reserve, inflation, NVIDIA stock). Such information reflects short-term market sentiment, investor attention, and macro-level signals that often precede price movements. To enable the model to reason about these factors, we include the textual summaries of these news items directly in the prompt, allowing LLM-based agents to incorporate qualitative contextsuch as sentiment shifts, policy expectations, or company-related eventsinto their trading decisions. 3.4. Action Space (i) At each timestep t, the agent makes an action at A, where denotes the probability simplex action specifies the proportion of the total portfolio value vt allocated to asset i, space. Each component (i) (i) satisfying the budget constraint t = 1. By default, we assume long-only setting where 0 for all i. This continuous allocation-based formulation abstracts away low-level trading execution and focuses on high-level portfolio rebalancing, allowing agents to express smooth strategic shifts over time and directly optimize for portfolio-level objectives such as return, risk, and stability. Stock market action In the stock market environment, each action component represents the percentage of the total portfolio value vt to be allocated to stock i. This allocation determines the post-trade position qt+1 through proportional rebalancing and directly reflects the agents capital distribution across sectors. (i) 7 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 3: Agent and environment framework in LiveTradeBench. The left side illustrates the simulated environment, which continuously retrieves real-world market prices and news, updating its internal state accordingly. It also adjusts the agents portfolio position based on the executed actions. The right side depicts the portfoliomanagement agent, equipped with analytical tools to process observations from the environment. The agent maintains memory of past observations, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. Prediction market action In the prediction market environment, each binary contract corresponds to two complementary assetsYES and NO. For active markets, the action vector at has 2k components, (k) t,NO denote the portfolio allocations to the YES and NO outcomes of market k, where (k) (k) = t,NO, where positive value respectively. The agents net exposure is defined as indicates higher confidence in the YES outcome. (k) t,YES and (k) t,YES 4. Designing LLM-based Agents for Portfolio Management In our framework, the agent is the central decision-making entity that transforms observed information into actionable portfolio allocations. It serves as the bridge between the external market and its internal portfolio memory, continuously adapting its strategy to changing conditions. The agent integrates three intertwined capabilitiestool use, memory, and reasoningthat together enable it to perceive, recall, and act, forming closed loop of information acquisition, reflection, and execution. Formally, at each timestep t, the agent receives an observation ot. In addition, the agent maintains an internal memory state Mt, which stores the past observation beyond the current one. Conditioned on both the current observation and memory, the agent produces an allocation at = fθ(ot, Mt), (3) where fθ is parameterized policy defining the agents trading behavior. Details on how we construct the prompt for the agent are available in Appendix S2. Tool use The first tool-use component enables the agent to interact with the live environment we providefetching, filtering, and extract real-time market and contextual information. While market prices pt and contextual signals ct are emitted by the environment, the tool-use module governs how the agent actively acquires and processes them. It acts as the agent interface with the real world, transforming raw inputs into structured feature representations ot = h(ot), (4) that capture both quantitative dynamics (e.g., price changes, returns, and volatility features derived from pt) and qualitative cues (e.g., news relevant to specific markets extracted from ct). Through tool 8 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models use, the agent extends its perception beyond static observations, dynamically gathering and refining evidence to inform its allocation decisions. Memory The second memory component maintains compact representation of the agents recent observations and the outcome of its actions. At each timestep, the agent stores fixed-length sequence of past observations and concatenates them into unified memory state: Mt = {oτ τ < t}, (5) where denotes the memory horizon. This concatenated memory provides temporal context beyond the current observation, enabling the agent to capture dependencies such as volatility dynamics, allocation adjustments, and drawdown trends. By conditioning its decisions on both ot and Mt, the agent becomes adaptive to evolving market conditions over time. Reasoning The third reasoning component serves as the agents decision core. It integrates information gathered through tool use with contextual knowledge retained in memory, forming coherent understanding of the market at each moment. Before executing any action, the agent engages in reasoning process that follows the ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) framework, where it first generates intermediate thoughts to interpret signals, recall relevant experiences, and hypothesize about potential outcomes. Similar to chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), this step produces explicit reasoning traces that connect perception and decision. Such interpretability allows the resulting actions to be analyzed and considered as rational responses to evolving market contexts. Through this deliberate reasoningthenacting cycle, the agent achieves both adaptability and transparency in portfolio management. Such reasoning rationales can be potentially used to help researchers understand the model behavior and utilized as resources to improve LLMs. 5. Evaluating LLM-based Agents under Live Test In this section, we present detailed evaluation results and analyses of live trading conducted from August 18, 2025, to October 24, 2025a total of 50 trading daysacross trading agents built on 21 unique LLM backbones. Section 5.1 and 5.2 describe the evaluation setup, including model backbones and performance metrics. Section 5.3 reports the main results, and Section 5.4 provides in-depth analyses and discussions. 5.1. Backbone LLMs for Evaluation To benchmark performance in the live trading environment, we evaluate diverse set of mainstream LLMs as trading agents. Specifically, we consider six representative model families. These models are selected based on two main criteria: (1) their state-of-the-art performance on general-purpose reasoning, knowledge and agentic benchmarks, and (2) their diversity in model size, architecture, and performance levels, which allows us to study performance gradients across heterogeneous systems in financial decision-making tasks. LLM family We include the following representative models: Claude family (Claude-Sonnet3.7 (Anthropic, 2025a), Claude-Opus-4 & Claude-Sonnet-4 (Anthropic, 2025b), Claude-Opus-4.1 (Anthropic, 2025c)), Grok family (Grok-3 (xAI, 2025a), Grok-4 (xAI, 2025b)), Qwen family (Qwen2.572B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct & Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking (Yang LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models et al., 2025)), LLaMA family (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo (Meta, 2025a), Llama4-Scout & Llama4Maverick (Meta, 2025b)), GPT family (GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025b), GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024), GPT4.1 (OpenAI, 2025a), GPT-o3 (OpenAI, 2025c)), Kimi family (Kimi-K2-Instruct (Team et al., 2025)), and DeepSeek family (DeepSeek-V3.1 (DeepSeek, 2025), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025)). Each model is wrapped in the same agentic framework that converts market observations into natural-language prompts and parses model outputs into structured portfolio allocation vectors. This unified setup ensures that performance differences primarily reflect the models intrinsic reasoning and decisionmaking abilities rather than disparities in prompt formatting or execution. Details on the model selection are available in Appendix S3. 5.2. Trading Metrics for Evaluation To evaluate the performance of trading agents, we employ four widely used financial metrics: cumulative return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown (MDD). These metrics jointly capture profitability, risk exposure, risk-adjusted efficiency, and downside protection, offering comprehensive view of trading performance across different markets. Cumulative return (CR = vTv0 It measures the overall profitability of an investment strategy over given evaluation period. Here, v0 and vT denote the initial and final portfolio values, respectively, and is the total number of timesteps during evaluation. higher cumulative return CR indicates stronger cumulative gains achieved by the trading agent. ) Sharpe ratio (SR = rr σ ) It evaluates the efficiency of returns relative to the amount of risk taken. Here, denotes the mean return, is the risk-free rate representing the baseline return from no-risk investment, and σ is the volatility of returns. In the U.S. stocks, corresponds to the short-term Treasury yield (typically positive), whereas in the Polymarket, is set to 0 to reflect the absence of yield on stablecoin-denominated assets. higher Sharpe ratio SR signifies that the strategy achieves greater reward per unit of risk, reflecting superior risk-adjusted performance. maxi[1,t] vivt Maximum drawdown (MDD = maxt[1,T] It quantifies the largest observed decline maxi[1,t] vi from historical peak to subsequent trough in portfolio value before new peak is reached. Here, vt represents the portfolio value at time step t. smaller MDD indicates better downside protection and stronger resilience against severe losses. ) Win rate (WR = 1 It measures the proportion of profitable trading steps, capturing T1 the agents consistency in generating positive returns. Here, I() equals 1 when the return rt is positive and 0 otherwise. higher win rate WR indicates that the agent achieves gains more frequently, complementing cumulative and risk-adjusted metrics by reflecting short-term decision reliability. I(rt > 0)) t=2 (cid:113) 1 T1 Volatility (σ = t=1(rt r)2) It reflects the variability of returns and serves as measure of investment risk. Here, rt = vtvt1 t=1 rt is the average vt1 return, and is the total number of evaluation timesteps.

Evaluation Results Trading performance on one market does not generalize to another. As shown in Table 2, the Sharpe ratio correlation between the two markets is close to zero, indicating that success in one market does not imply success in the other. This highlights the need for market-specific trading strategies. For example, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Grok-4 show relatively consistent performance across both the stock and prediction markets, suggesting more stable and low-volatility strategies. In contrast, GPT-4.1 achieves the highest cumulative return rate (> 6%) in the stock market but performs poorly in Polymarket (return < 30%), likely due to overreactive allocation changes under higher volatility. Overall, the prediction market exhibits faster dynamics, greater volatility, and deeper drawdowns (MDD), demanding more agile and risk-tolerant strategies. High general LLM capability does not imply strong financial performance. Figures 4 show that general LLM ability, as measured by LMArena scores, has slightly negative correlation with trading abilities. In the stock market, the Spearman correlation between LMArena scores and cumulative returns is only 0.054virtually no relationship. In Polymarket, the correlation drops to 0.38, meaning models with higher general language ability often perform worse in the dynamic market. Thus, state11 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 4: Correlation between LMArena score and Sharpe ratio across two markets. (left) U.S. stock market. (right) Polymarket prediction market. Models from different families are shown in different colors, and the dashed line indicates the linear regression fit. of-the-art LLMs on general benchmarks do not necessarily translate to state-of-the-art performance in dynamic, real-world trading. It highlights the uniqueness and necessity of our environment. Distinct portfolio management styles emerge across models. Different models exhibit distinct management preferences. Claude-Opus-4.1 and Grok-4 adopt conservative strategies characterized by lower volatility and smaller drawdowns, prioritizing stability over aggressive gains. In contrast, Kimi-K2-Instruct and GPT-5 display more risk-seeking behaviorsaccepting higher volatility and MDD in pursuit of greater returns. Beyond return and risk metrics, models also differ notably in their portfolio composition and cash management patterns. For instance, GPT-4o consistently focuses on few core assets (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA), whereas GPT-5 diversifies across broader range of stocks with smaller position ratios. Likewise, Llama4-Scout maintains persistently high cash ratio (above 20%), reflecting more cautious liquidity stance, while GPT-5 always keeps cash below 10% throughout trading except in extremely high risk. These behavioral patterns are not limited to single marketsimilar management styles emerge consistently across both markets. Large reasoning models do not confer trading advantages. Consistent with findings from Chen et al. (2025), models explicitly designed for reasoningsuch as DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking, and GPT-o3do not outperform others in trading performance. Instead, they exhibit substantially higher volatility (>140 in Polymarket), implying over-adjustment during the decision process. The type of reasoning beneficial for mathematical or coding tasks does not straightforwardly transfer to financial or social reasoning. In fact, excessive deliberation observed in these models during trading can introduce instability and degrade trading consistency. 12 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 5: Rolling k-delta analysis on U.S. stocks.

Each bar indicates the proportion of reasoning traces that reference position, price, or news information. single reasoning trace may include multiple information sources. 5.4. Analysis and Discussion In this section, we quantitatively analyze two core questions that probe the fundamental capabilities of LLM-based trading agents. (1) Are LLM-based agents merely random guessers? This examines whether the agents trading behaviors reflect meaningful market understanding or simply random fluctuations. (2) How do agents reason and make trading decisions? This investigates the internal rationale behind their actions, revealing whether their decisions are grounded in coherent reasoning patterns. Together, these analyses shed light on both the effectiveness and interpretability of LLM-based agents in dynamic, uncertain market environments. Are LLM agents just random guessing? To verify that LLM-based trading agents exhibit genuine market awareness rather than random behavior, we design the rolling-k delta ( k) analysis. The key idea is that if the agents decisions are random, delaying their actions by several days should not systematically affect performance. Conversely, if they truly adapt to changing market conditions, stale decisions should lead to measurable degradation. For each trading day t, we fix the portfolio position to the one taken days earlier, (k) = qtk, and compute daily and cumulative returns as (k) = (qtk)(pt+1 pt) (qtk)pt , CR(k) = Tk1 t=k (1 + (k) ) 1. (6) The rolling-k delta is then defined as = CR(k) CR(0), capturing the cumulative return loss when the agents actions lag behind the market by days. negative indicates that more frequent rebalancing improves performance. As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, larger (slower updates) leads to higher degradation, confirming that timely decision updates are beneficial. Interestingly, in the stock market, returns slightly improve to 0.03% when = 2, suggesting smoother dynamics and lower time sensitivity compared to the Polymarket, where performance degrades 2% as increases. Overall, these results demonstrate that LLM-based agents do not act randomlytheir trading strategies depend on contemporaneous market signals, and delaying their actions systematically harms performance. LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models How do LLM agents reason and make decisions? To investigate decision-making rationale, we employ LLM-based reasoning annotation. For each days reasoning trace, another LLM automatically identifies whether the agents explanation references: (1) portfolio position, (2) market price history, or (3) market news. Figure 7 summarizes the distribution of these factors. In both markets, news emerges as the most frequently cited factor, followed by market price history, while position information is less dominant. Moreover, the Polymarket agents rely more heavily on news signals, while stockmarket agents emphasize price trendsvalidating our hypothesis that the two markets exhibit distinct dynamics. Since the total percentage of reasoning references exceeds 100%, many decisions integrate multiple information sources, indicating complex reasoning processes. Specifically, agents often mention price momentum when analyzing price history and focus on potential outcomes or implications when discussing market news. 6. Case Study In this section, we show examples of both the U.S stock and Polymarket prediction markets by selecting representative assets among each of them and highlighting two distinct and extreme time points for each to analyze. This allows us to examine the reasoning behind the agents decisions and understand how their choices correlate with market conditions. 6.1. Cash Asset Dynamics in the U.S. Stock Market In Figure 8, we analyze the dynamics of cash assets in the portfolio and highlight two contrasting market scenariosa positive (bullish) case and negative (bearish) casein the U.S. stock market. The cash ratio serves as an informative indicator of risk management: higher cash ratio typically reflects greater risk aversion and defensive stance, whereas lower cash ratio suggests stronger market confidence and more aggressive investment posture. Tech stock rally on August 28 On August 28, the average cash ratio across all 21 models declined steadily over three consecutive days, dropping from 17% to 7.5% within four trading days. This trend coincided with strong rally in major technology stocks such as Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which encouraged agents to invest more aggressively and reduce their cash holdings. Notably, GPT-4.1, the agent achieving the highest cumulative return rate, provided the following rationale for its allocation decision: This allocation increases exposure to leading AI and tech growth stocks (NVDA, MSFT, META) following strong earnings momentum and positive analyst sentiment, while maintaining solid positions in diversified blue chips for stability and sector balance. This reasoning explicitly aligns with the observed decrease in the cash ratio during the bullish market phase. Market drawdown on October 10 In contrast, the sharp market drawdown on October 10 induced the opposite behavior. Most of the stock prices dropped significantlyTesla (TSLA) fell over 5%, while Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) declined by more than 4%leading to negative returns for all agents on that day. In response, most agents increased their cash holdings to mitigate risk, reflecting collective shift toward defensive strategy. As shown on the right of Figure 8, multiple agents provided similar reasoning related to increasing CASH positions to protect against volatility. Among them, Gemini-2.5-Pro, which maintained relatively high cash position and converted additional assets to cash before the downturn, experienced the smallest loss that day. 14 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 8: Case study for U.S. stock markets. (Left) The average cash ratio across 21 models over 50 trading days. (Right) zoomed-in view of the sharp drawdown on October 10, during which portfolios exhibited sudden increase in cash holdings. We visualize the market condition (price change) and present the reasoning traces of the best-performing model on October 10 (Gemini-2.5-Pro) and one of the worst-performing models on October 10 (DeepSeek-V3.1) for comparison. 6.2. RussiaUkraine Ceasefire Market in Polymarket Prediction Market We analyze the market Russia Ukraine ceasefire in 2025? on Polymarket, focusing on how real-time news influences the decision-making of LLM-based agents. Polymarkets high sensitivity to external information makes it natural testbed to evaluate how models interpret and act on dynamic geopolitical signals. We select this market for the case study because it experiences frequent fluctuations during the 50 trading days, resulting in distinct behaviors and returns across models. As shown in Figure 9, the Grok-3 model is able to conduct belief-based reasoning, adjusting its internal estimate of the ceasefire probability from 0.15 on October 13 to 0.22 on October 17. Reactive change on October 13 without profit On October 13, most agents abruptly switched their portfolios from No to Yes positions after two optimistic news events: (1) Zelenskyy stated that the Gaza deal brings hope for Ukraine, and (2) reports surfaced that Trump shared U.S. intelligence to help Kyiv strike Russian energy targets. These headlines appeared relevant to the ceasefire, prompting agents to buy into the Yes position. However, the Polymarket price showed little actual movement, and this reactive change produced no profit. The news turned out to have limited causal impact on the ceasefire likelihood. This case highlights key challenge for LLM-based agents: distinguishing between attention-grabbing but non-decisive news and genuinely influential events. Acting on superficial correlations can lead to overreaction and unprofitable trades. In contrast, on October 17, when news broke that Zelenskyy Strategic hold on October 17 with profit visited the White House, most agents strengthened their Yes positions and held them through the 15 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Fig. 9: Case study in Polymarket prediction markets. (Left) The average holding ratios of Yes and No position ratios in the market Russia Ukraine ceasefire in 2025? across 21 models. (Right) zoomed-in view of two abrupt shifts (October 13 and October 17), along with the corresponding news events and the reasoning traces of Grok-3 explaining these allocation decisions. following day. This time, the Polymarket price steadily increased from October 17 to 18, leading to tangible profits. Unlike the earlier overreaction, agents displayed more grounded reasoningciting recent diplomatic developments and recognizing significant price jump to 0.18 as confirming evidence. This scenario illustrates that maintaining positions through credible, high-impact events can yield better outcomes than frequent reactive shifts based on weak signals. 7. Conclusion In this work, we present LiveTradeBench, live multi-market environment for evaluating LLM-based agents in realistic portfolio management tasks. LiveTradeBench introduces new paradigm for assessing model intelligence beyond static benchmarks, enabling continuous interaction, reasoning, and adaptation within real-time stock and prediction markets. Through 50-day live experiments, we find that strong performance in one market does not generalize to others, underscoring the heterogeneity and specialization required across market types. Moreover, high scores on generalpurpose benchmarks like LMArena do not necessarily translate into superior trading performance, highlighting gap between text intelligence and dynamic decision-making. Finally, our analyses reveal that LLM-based agents rely jointly on historical price trends, market news, allocation history, exhibiting distinct behavioral patterns under extreme conditions. Overall, LiveTradeBench provides foundation for studying how LLM-based agents perceive, reason, and act under uncertainty in live and realistic trading environmentspaving the way for developing more adaptive, financially grounded, and socially intelligent agent systems. 16 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models"

            "content": "Despite demonstrating the feasibility of evaluating LLM-based trading agents in live multi-market environments, our framework still has thee main limitations that point to promising directions for future research and development. Transaction costs and market frictions Our current environment and evaluation do not account for transaction fees, bidask spreads, liquidity constraints, or other real-world trading frictions. Ignoring these factors may overestimate achievable returns, especially for strategies that rely on frequent rebalancing. Future work will incorporate more realistic cost models and slippage simulations to better approximate real trading conditions. Limited observation and action space The current framework constrains both the observation and action spaces due to the limited context length of existing LLMs. For the observation space, the agent can only access restricted temporal window of price, position, and news histories, and these are limited to small set of markets in both the stock market and the prediction market. Moreover, news inputs are truncated to titles and abstracts rather than full articles, preventing the agent from incorporating long-form textual information that may contain deeper market signals. For the action space, the scope of possible trading actions is similarly constrained by the limited number of supported markets, reducing the complexity and richness of allocation decisions. Future work could extend the framework to support longer temporal horizons, richer textual context, and dynamic market expansionenabling agents to observe and act within more realistic, information-rich environments. Simplified agent design The current agent architecture integrates basic tool use and memory under the ReAct framework but remains limited in reasoning depth and temporal abstraction. Future work can enhance each component systematically. For tool use, agents can be equipped with more specialized analytical and retrieval tools for financial reasoning, news interpretation, and risk assessment. For memory, richer hierarchical and long-term memory mechanisms can be introduced to capture temporal dependencies and retain cross-market knowledge over extended horizons. Beyond the basic ReAct-based setups, the current framework can be extended to multi-agent paradigm, such as TradingAgents (Xiao et al., 2024b), to better model heterogeneous roles and market interactions. Finally, incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) to train trading agents (Xiao et al., 2025) represents promising direction for improving decision qualityenabling agents to learn from experience, refine their reasoning, and continuously adapt to dynamic market conditions. Open-source Application To democratize research on LLM-based trading agents, we release an open-source Python package, live-trade-bench , which provides simple APIs for data collection, environment setup, and agent construction. Building on this package, we also develop web application that deploys our trading environment in real time, enabling live data streaming and interactive monitoring of agent performance. Details of the user interface (UI) design are provided in Appendix S4. https://pypi.org/project/live-trade-bench/ 17 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models"

Sotopia: Interactive evaluation for social intelligence in language agents. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.11667, 2023c. 24 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models S1. Data Collection We collect live prices and news signals to populate the observation space for both Stock market and Polymarket. Prices come from public finance API (equities) and Polymarket CLOB endpoints (prediction markets); context comes from Google News and Reddit. All fetchers use randomized delays, standard User-Agent, and exponential-backoff retries; JSON parsing is retried small number of times with conservative timeouts. Retrieved items are bound to tickers or market IDs and presented to the agent alongside account history. S1.1. Market News Data Source and window For trading day t, we query Google News over short window [t3, t1] to reduce same-day leakage while preserving timeliness. Results are ranked by proximity to when target date is available, else by recency. Query construction For stocks we use <TICKER> stock news OR <Company Name>; for Polymarket we use the market question text. The fetcher pages through date-bounded results. Normalization We parse per-article title, snippet, link (Google redirect cleaned), source, and timestamp. Relative times (e.g., 3 hours ago) and absolute dates (e.g., Oct 12, 2025) are normalized to UNIX time. Items lacking valid timestamp are dropped. Remaining items are tagged with the originating symbol/question and sorted within the window. S1.2. Stock Price Data Source and window We retrieve U.S. equity prices from public finance API (yfinance). For trading day t, we form 10-day lookback ending at t1 to mitigate same-day leakage; if no date is given, we use the latest snapshot. Universe and queries We track small, curated universe (default 15 tickers). For dated queries, we download daily bars over half-open window [start, end+1) to match the providers convention; the current price is taken as the latest available trade/quote. Normalization We expose the current price together with compact daily history containing date, adjusted close, and volume. If dated close is unavailable, we fall back to the best available price within that day. S1.3. Polymarket Price Data Source and window We use public endpoints for market discovery and for prices/history. As with stocks, per-token history uses 10-day lookback ending at t1 to reduce leakage. Market discovery We discover active (or date-filtered) markets and collect question, category, outcomes, token IDs, and URLs (constructing them from event slugs when missing). We further filter to verified subset by deduplicating markets that share an event slug, requiring observable history, and removing near-flat series below minimum price-range threshold. 25 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Normalization For each token, we expose the current price (on or latest) and per-day history with date and price. Exchange quotes are normalized to probabilities in [0, 1] (dividing by 100 when endpoints return cents). S2. Prompting Details In LiveTradeBench, each trading step is framed as structured text prompt that guides the LLMs decision-making process. We define market-specific decision prompt, which forms the full model input and consists of two components: dynamic context prompt and fixed instruction header. The context prompt summarizes the agents current observationmarket status, recent news, and account informationwhile the instruction header provides global objectives, portfolio principles, and output requirements. Because the full text is lengthy, we present each markets prompt across two tables (stocks: Tables S2, S3; Polymarket: Tables S4, S5). The following subsections describe them in detail. Stock context prompt The context prompt mirrors the observation space and includes three elements: market analysis (current prices and short recent histories for each ticker), recent news grouped by ticker, and account information showing past allocations and cumulative performance (Table S2). This dynamic block provides the local state and external signals needed for decision reasoning. Stock decision prompt The decision prompt (Table S3) combines the context above with dated header, explicit trading objectives and evaluation criteria (risk-adjusted return, diversification, turnover awareness), portfolio principles, the list of tradable assets, and JSON-only output schema specifying the fields reasoning and allocations (weights summing to 1.0 including CASH). This forms the full prompt delivered to the model and constrains outputs to align with the portfolio action space. Polymarket context prompt For prediction markets, the context prompt organizes market analysis by question with YES/NO prices (implied probabilities) and short histories, recent news grouped by question, and account information showing allocations (including CASH) and performance (Table S4). This representation emphasizes the agents belief states and position history. Polymarket decision prompt The decision prompt (Table S5) combines the contextual information with task-specific instructions: the agent may choose at most one side (YES or NO) per question, compare its internal belief (p) with the market probability pmkt while considering transaction costs, and output allocations normalized to sum to 1.0 over available outcomes and CASH. As in the stock setup, this constitutes the complete model input, enforcing executable portfolio allocations. S3. Model Details We evaluate mainstream chat LLMs across families, using the same pool for both the stock and Polymarket settings. Table S1 summarizes the families and concrete variants included in our evaluation. Provider routing We invoke models through thin client (LiteLLM) with automatic provider resolution. Model strings prefixed by vendor names are routed accordingly (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet, gemini/gemini-2.5-pro, x-ai/grok-4); unprefixed names default to Together AI. For standard chat models we set temperature = 0.3 and max tokens = 16000; for 26 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Table S1: Model families and variants used in LiveTradeBench.

Responses are parsed and validated before application to accounts. S4. Frontend UI Details In this section, we provide detailed description of the LiveTradeBench front-end UI, which consists of six main pages. The first is the Leaderboard Page (Figure S1), which shows the ranking of each LLM model by the profit return rate. Each Stock model starts with 1000 USD and each Polymarket model starts with 500 USD. The second is the Stock Page (Figure S2), which shows all 21 LLM Stock models. On this page, there are detailed model cards (Figure S3) of each LLM Stock model. The third is the Polymarket Page (Figure S4), which shows the all 21 LLM Polymarket models. On this page, there are detailed model cards (Figure S5) of each LLM Stock model. The fourth is the News Page (Figure S6), which shows the recents news of Stock-market and Polymarket. 27 LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models Table S2: Example of stock context prompt.
