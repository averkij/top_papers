            "content": "Building change detection from remote sensing imagery is essential for urban planning, cadastral updates, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. Deep learning has driven significant progress, but model development and evaluation remain constrained by the limitations of existing datasets. Current change detection benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: Geographic Homogeneity. LEVIR-CD+ [1] covers 20 regions in Texas, USA, while WHU-CD [4] consists of single image pair from Christchurch, New Zealand. Models trained on such geographically constrained data learn region-specific featuresparticular building styles, urban layouts, vegetation patterns, and imaging conditions that fail to generalize across geographic domains. Limited Scale and Diversity. Existing datasets contain hundreds to thousands of image pairs, insufficient to capture the full variability of real-world change detection scenarios, including dense urban cores, suburban sprawl, rural villages, industrial zones, and varying terrain. We address these limitations with FOTBCD, dataset family derived from Frances authoritative geographic databases. In this work, we focus on the public release of FOTBCD-Binary, large-scale benchmark for binary building change detection: National Coverage: 28 departments across mainland France (25 for training and 3 held out for evaluation), spanning diverse geographic and urban contexts from Mediterranean coastal regions to rural Atlantic areas. High Resolution: 0.2 m/pixel aerial orthophotos from IGNs BD ORTHO database. Binary Change Annotations: CHANGE / NO-CHANGE masks large-scale benchmarking. Pixel-wise suitable for Spatially Referenced: All patches are associated with patch-level spatial metadata, including projected-coordinate bounding boxes, enabling GIS integration. Scale: Approximately 28,000 image pairs yielding over 100,000 training 256x256 patches. In addition, we release FOTBCD-Instances (Research Dataset), smaller subset with instancelevel polygon annotations distinguishing NEW, DEMOLISHED, and UNCHANGED buildings, illustrating the full annotation schema and enabling instance-level experimentation. Our experiments demonstrate that geographic diversity is key factor for cross-domain generalization. Models trained on geographically limited datasets (LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD) exhibit substantial performance degradation when evaluated on FOTBCD-Binary. In contrast, model trained on FOTBCD-Binary transfers effectively to WHU-CD and comparably to LEVIR-CD+ in relative terms, despite differences in imagery source and regional characteristics."

LEVIR-CD [1] contains 637 pairs of 10241024 Google Earth images at 0.5 resolution, covering approximately 20 regions in Texas, USA.

WHU-CD [4] provides single large pair of aerial images (32,50715,354 pixels at 0.2 resolution) from Christchurch, New Zealand, captured before and after the 2011 earthquake. While high-resolution, it represents only one city and single change event. LEVIR-CD+ extends LEVIR-CD with additional image pairs while maintaining the same geographic scope and annotation format. In contrast, FOTBCD-Binary provides large-scale geographic diversity at the national level, enabling evaluation across wide range of urban, suburban, and rural environments.

FOTBCD-Binary, the primary public benchmark used for all experiments in this work, provides pixelwise binary change annotations indicating the presence or absence of building change between two temporal images. These binary masks are derived from building-level change inference and are designed for large-scale benchmarking and cross-domain generalization studies. In addition, we release FOTBCD-Instances, smaller subset with instance-level polygon annotations in COCO format. This subset illustrates the full annotation schema and supports instance-level analysis and experimentation. Each building instance is assigned one of three semantic classes: 1. UNCHANGED (category id=1): present in both temporal images. Buildings 2. DEMOLISHED (category id=2): Buildings present in the before image but absent in the after image. 3. NEW (category id=3): Buildings absent in the before image but present in the after image. For binary change detection, the NEW and DEMOLISHED classes are merged into single CHANGE category, while UNCHANGED buildings are ignored. The instance-level polygon representation enables precise boundary evaluation beyond pixel-wise metrics, instance-level performance analysis, and future research on multi-class and instance-aware change detection.

Training data are derived automatically from temporal differences in BD TOPO, aligned with corresponding BD ORTHO imagery. Building-level change signals are inferred using combination of rule-based filtering, domain-specific heuristics, and learned components, and subsequently converted into binary change masks. As with most large-scale automatically generated datasets, the training set may contain limited label noise. However, our experimental results indicate that this noise does not materially affect model performance. Validation and Test Sets. Validation and test data are sourced from three departments that are completely excluded from the training set, ensuring zero geographic overlap. All validation and test samples are manually selected and verified by human annotators, providing reliable evaluation benchmark despite potential noise in the training data. The quality control pipeline includes: 1. Temporal Alignment: Ensuring consistency between BD ORTHO acquisition dates and BD TOPO snapshot dates. 2. Topological and Semantic Validation: Detailed analysis of BD TOPO building geometry and metadata, followed by the application of domain-specific rules to remove implausible or inconsistent changes. 3. AI-Based Filtering: Automated detection of residual inconsistencies and rare edge cases. 4.

Models trained on geographically constrained datasets exhibit substantial performance degradation when evaluated on 5 FOTBCD-Binary. LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD achieve IoU scores of 0.3003 and 0.3417, respectively, indicating limited transfer to more geographically diverse, national-scale dataset. Generalization from FOTBCD-Binary. model trained on FOTBCD-Binary generalizes well to WHUCD, achieving an IoU of 0.6974, and performs comparably to the inverse transfer when evaluated on LEVIR-CD+ (0.2984). While cross-dataset performance remains below in-domain results, these outcomes are consistently more balanced than those observed when transferring from geographically constrained datasets to FOTBCD-Binary. Asymmetric domain shift. Cross-evaluation between LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD also results in large performance drops relative to in-domain training, confirming that geographic domain shift is general challenge in building change detection and not specific to any single dataset. In particular, models trained constrained benchmarks. on FOTBCD-Binary generalize more consistently across datasets, while models trained on LEVIR-CD+ or WHUCD experience substantial performance degradation when evaluated on FOTBCD-Binary.

            "content": "Our experiments indicate that geographic diversity at the dataset level is key factor for improving robustness to cross-region domain shift in building change detection. This observation is consistent with findings in other machine learning domains, where diversity in training data often has greater impact on out-of-distribution performance than raw dataset size. The 25 training departments included in FOTBCDBinary span wide range of geographic and environmental conditions, including: Multiple climate regimes (oceanic, continental, Mediterranean, mountain, and semi-arid) Diverse architectural styles and settlement patterns Terrain variations ranging from lowland plains to mountainous regions Exposure to this diversity encourages models to learn more general change-related cues, rather than overfitting to region-specific building appearances, layouts, or imaging conditions. This effect is reflected in the crossdataset evaluation results, where models trained on geographically constrained benchmarks struggle to generalize to FOTBCD-Binary, while training on more diverse national-scale dataset leads to more balanced transfer behavior."
