However, reliance on such knowledge can become double-edged sword. For example, when an elderly person consults an LLM for medical advice, the model may retrieve information that is partially accurate but intermixed with content heavily influenced by the promotion of unproven and unreliable remedies. In such high-stakes decisionmaking scenarios, LLMs may retrieve or generate misleading information, which can lead to irreversible harm (Han et al., 2025)such as steering users toward costly, ineffective, or even dangerous treatments. Prior research demonstrates that LLMs enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023) or advanced websearch tools (Schick et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023) are generally more trustworthy (Huang et al., 2024) and effective in user assistance (Yang et al., 2024c). Their robust in-context learning capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2024) enable integration of diverse information sources, mitigating hallucinations and factual errors (Tonmoy et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). However, the theoretical understanding of how LLMs weigh retrieved information, especially when mixed with inappropriate content, remains limited. The mechanisms by which LLMs attend to or filter noisy, unreliable, or harmful materials are not well understood. Empirically, this limitation manifests in concerning ways. In open-web retrieval settings, LLMs often incorporate misleading, impermissible, or low-quality content into their responses, including violations of intellectual property (Xu et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), breaches of privacy (Pan et al., 2020), and the generation of deceptive (Liu et al., 2024a) or fraudulent outputs (MÃ¡jovsk`y et al., 2023), posing irreversible harm in high-stakes contexts. The challenge that LLMs often receive mixture of relevant and disproportionate inappropriate context raises critical question: How do LLMs Figure 1: This figure illustrates Poisoned Context Testbed we constructed to study how LLMs prioritze and process mixed context. The testbed contains pairs of user queries and real-world mixed contexts combining relevant information and inappropriate content. We also find that LLMs exposed to even small amount of inappropriate context can be misled to give undesirable responses. process and prioritize different contextual cues? To systematically study this behavior, we first introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, which simulates real-world scenarios by pairing user queries with combination of authentic relevant information and inappropriate content. As illustrated in Figure 1, the testbed consists of user queries accompanied by mixed contexts blending helpful and harmful information. The testbed covers several types of inappropriate content, including privacy violations, fake news, hate speech, and non-factual information. Building on this setup, we draw inspiration from how animals form associations between stimuli and adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model (Kremer, 1978; Rescorla, 2008), which describes how the associative strength of each stimulus is updated, to explain and quantify how multiple retrieved contexts compete to influence LLM responses. We present our adapted RW model in detail in Section 2.3. The main take away of the model is that LLMs consistently tend to increase the influence of less dominant information in their current response distribution, making it more likely to be reflected in the output, while reinforcing already prominent information at slower rate. Our RW model reveals that LLMs exposed to mixed context are vulnerable to inappropriate information, posing risks in real-world retrievalbased applications. Notably, even small amount of harmful content can disproportionately affect model behavior. Empirical evaluations on our testbed further validate this vulnerability: both openand closed-source LLMs exhibit similar degradation patterns to the prediction of our RW model, with the state-of-the-art model, GPT-4o, experiencing 23% drop in response quality when single piece of fake news context is introduced among twenty accurate contexts. These results highlight the undesired behavior curve of LLMs when confronted with inappropriate information. To address this challenge, we propose RWSteering, state-of-the-art context engineering approach that enhances LLM robustness to inappropriate context and reverses the undesired behavior curves revealed by our adapted Rescorla-Wagner model and experiments. Instead of relying on extensive supervision across diverse context mixtures, RW-Steering enables the model to internally identify and discount inappropriate signals using limited training data. It generalizes effectively across varying proportions of inappropriate content and outperforms traditional context filtering approaches. Our experiments show that RW-Steering substantially improves model response quality; our best fine-tuned LLM achieves an average improvement of 39.8% across different context mixtures compared to the original model. Furthermore, it corrects key behavioral vulnerabilities in different scenarios, suggesting that RW-Steering improves the reliability and safety of LLMs in real-world, retrieval-augmented applications. Overall, our contributions are: (1) We introduce Poisoned Context Testbed with user queries paired with real inappropriate content to study LLM behavior under mixed-context inputs. (2) We adapt the Rescorla-Wagner model to explain how LLMs prioritize context and accurately characterize their behavior curves, exposing vulnerability where minimal inappropriate content can significantly degrade responses. (3) We propose RW-Steering, state-of-the-art context engineering approach that enables LLMs to internally detect and discount inappropriate context, thereby mitigating its influence and reversing undesired behavior curves."

To address this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed (Section 2.1) for systematic analysis, adapt the Rescorla-Wagner Model (Kremer, 1978; Rescorla, 2008) from neuroscience to explain LLM behavior (Section 2.2), and derive behavior curves that expose consistent patterns and critical vulnerability in retrieval-based use cases (Section 2.3)."

Specifically, each entry in our testbed consists of user query, blend of retrievable context containing both inappropriate and relevant information, and set of reference ground truths aligned to the query. We organized the inappropriate context into four categories: privacy-violating data, fake news, hate speech, and non-factual data. To simulate realistic scenarios, we collected all the inappropriate context from established realworld datasets, including privacy data from the Adult-Census-Income dataset (Pooja2512), fakenews data from LIAR dataset (Wang, 2017), Hate speech data from the ETHOS dataset (Mollas et al., 2022), and Non-factual data from the Counterfact dataset (Meng et al., 2022). Using this data, GPT4o generated natural queries for each category and retrieved related real-world information to create query-linked data samples, with GPT-4o also generating reference ground truths. We sampled 100 examples per category, and three expert annotators verified all generated data for validity and reasonableness, resulting in 7.6K user queries and 45.3K different contextual information segments. The distribution of inappropriate context type for our testbed is provided in Table 4. Further details on the Poisoned Context Testbeds statistics, construction, and validation are in Appendix A."

            "content": "We draw an analogy between how animal brains learn to form associations between different stimuli and how LLMs associate pieces of context from mixture of inputs to generate their responses. The in-detail analogy is presented in Appendix B. The core formula that we borrow from neuroscience is the RW Model, which is based on the following setting: Given an animal brain which tries to associate with types of different stimuli, the association strength binding the brain and the ith type of stimuli is currently Vi. Now, the brain receives another experience with stimuli i, the association strength the animal brain will grow for this piece of extra stimuli can be represented as: Vi = Î±iÎ² Î» Vi Î³ Vj . (1) (cid:88) j=1,j=i where Î» denotes the total association strength that the brain can form with all stimuli. The parameter Î±i represents constant corresponding to the inherent strength of stimulus (e.g., the volume of sound), while Î² is constant associated with the brains learning capability. The parameter Î³ serves as coefficient that balances the influence of different stimuli and is typically set to one by default. This model reveals an intrinsic tendency in animal brains: they are more likely to associate learning with novel and infrequent stimuli, rather than with stimuli that already have established associations. When adapting this model to the context of LLMs, we interpret \"association strength\" as reflected in the LLMs output probability distribution, where Vi denotes the probability that the LLM generates its output based on context type i. Assuming that all probabilities sum to one, and that the model is unlikely to generate outputs based on unrelated information, we derive: (cid:88) i=1 Vi 1, Î» = 1 (2) Applying Eq. 2 to equation 1, we derive: Vi Î±iÎ² 1 Î³ (1 Vi) . (3) In practice, we observe that Î³ varies with the number of context pieces provided to the model, but it can be treated as constant when the total amount of context remains relatively stable. Moreover, since Vi is updated, the probabilities associated with the other context pieces must also be adjusted accordingly, normalized as follows: = Vj 1 1 Vi , for = i. (4) The key insight from our adapted RW model is that an LLMs tendency to increase the influence of piece of contextual information in its output is inversely related to its current dominance in the models output distribution."

By directly prompting various models and evaluating their responses, the study compares these behaviors to predictions from an adapted RW model. As shown in Figure 2 (Up) and (Down), theres strong correlation: small amount of initial inappropriate information drastically reduces response quality, though further inappropriate content has diminishing negative impact, aligning with RW model predictions. Both empirical findings and the RW model highlight significant vulnerability: inappropriate information introduced early in the context disproportionately skews model output. This poses challenges for applications like retrieval-based agents in web environments. Consequently, targeted strategies are needed to lessen the impact of this earlystage contamination and enhance model stability in real-world applications."

            "content": "in LLMs In realistic scenarios, LLMs often receive inputs composed of query and mixture of contextual information. We define the input to the model as sequence: = Concat(cÏ(1), cÏ(2), . . . , cÏ(n), q), (5) where = {c1, c2, . . . , cn} is set of context segments and is the query. The permutation Ï defines the ordering of context, which can place inappropriate information at any position in the sequence. Each context segment ci is associated with binary label yi {0, 1}, where yi = 1 indicates appropriate content and yi = 0 indicates inappropriate content. The proportion of inappropriate content is defined as: = 1 (cid:88) i=1 1[yi = 0], (6) which may vary across examples and, in particular, can be disproportionately low or high. This formulation captures the core challenge: under disproportionate mixture of context, the model must selectively rely on trustworthy information to maintain both output fidelity and safety; notably, to control positional bias (Ko et al., 2020), we average out positional effects by evenly rotating each context segment across all input positions, ensuring balanced exposure of appropriate and inappropriate content throughout the evaluation. Given input x, the LLM generates an output answer a. The objective is to ensure remains faithful to the query and the appropriate context subset C+ = {ci yi = 1}, while ignoring the influence of inappropriate segments. We evalute this by designing two metrics: (1) Consistency Lconsist, measuring the semantic similarity between and reference answer Ëa, reflecting correctness under contamination; (2) Cleanliness Lclean, assessing the presence of inappropriate content in from = {ci yi = 0}, where higher scores indicate stronger resistance. This setup captures the core challenge: under disproportionate context mixtures, the model must selectively attend to trustworthy content to preserve fidelity and safety. To control positional bias (Ko et al., 2020), we rotate Figure 2: UP: Behavior curves predicted by our adapted RescorlaWagner (RW) model and the actual responses of three LLMs when exposed to two types of contextual information. As the proportion of the first type (C1) increases, the RW models predictions closely match the LLMs real-world outputs.

Performance drops sharply when inappropriate information appears early, validating the pattern predicted by our RW model. context segments across all input positions to ensure balanced exposure during evaluation."

We examine two variants of this strategy. The first with self-alignment objective, where the model is trained to reproduce its own answer when the context consists solely of appropriate segments (i.e., C+ = {ci yi = 1}). The second is human-preference fine-tuning, where the inputs contain mixture of appropriate and inappropriate context, and are supervised to generate humanannotated reference answers constructed with full knowledge of yi. Although these approaches may improve the consistency score Lconsist under controlled contamination ratios, they tend to be brittle when applied to unseen context distributions, particularly in cases where the proportion 1[yi = 0] differs from training. This = 1 mismatch leads to degraded generalization performance, as the model cannot reliably isolate appropriate information across varying contamination levels, resulting in lowered robustness and elevated Lclean in adverse conditions. (cid:80)n i=1 Enhancing Model Awareness. As shown in Figure 3 (B), this method trains the model to predict binary labels Ëyi {0, 1} for each context segment ci, followed by alignment fine-tuning to generate the answer a. The goal is to improve the models internal representation of content appropriateness and reduce susceptibility to inappropriate signals. However, this approach decouples context classification from answer generationsince Ëyi predictions are not jointly optimized with Lconsist or Lclean, the model often detects harmful context but fails to exclude its influence from their final output, especially in ambiguous or heavily contaminated inputs. Context Filtering. As shown in Figure 3 (C), context filtering is lightweight approach where the model labels each context segment ci as appropriate or inappropriate, and rule-based step removes segments with Ëyi = 0 before answer generation. While simple and adaptable, it relies on accurate filtering. As revealed by our adapted RescorlaWagner Model in Eq. 3, even small number of inappropriate segments can disproportionately degrade answer quality, leading to suboptimal performance when filtering is imperfect."

            "content": "Based on our analysis of the baseline approaches in Section 3.2, we identify three key challenges: (1) alignment-based fine-tuning lacks generalizability when faced with complex and disproportionate mixtures of appropriate and inappropriate context; (2) self-awareness training is decoupled from the Figure 3: Our Approaches for Steering the Behavior of LLMs. Left: Three baseline approaches considered, each subject to different limitations. Right: Our RW-Steering approach. We first restructure the prompt to encourage the model to jointly optimize its judgment of inappropriate context and the generation of human-preferred answers, thereby internalizing the desired behavior. We then supplement training with examples containing small number of inappropriate context segments to address cases where the models internal judgment may fail. answer generation process, limiting its effectiveness; and (3) context filtering is often imperfect, allowing residual inappropriate content to trigger the contextual bias highlighted by our adapted RW model. Inspired by (Liu et al., 2024b), we propose novel RW-Steering approach to address the limitations of prior baselines and robustly reverse the undesired behavior curve of LLMs. As shown in Figure 3 (D), our approach first addresses challenges (1) and (2) simultaneously by jointly integrating context appropriateness assessment and answer generation. Given an input sequence = Concat(cÏ(1), cÏ(2), . . . , cÏ(n), q), where each context segment ci has binary label yi {0, 1}, the model is first prompted to predict set of binary labels Ëyi indicating whether each segment is inappropriate (Ëyi = 0). Based on this, it then generates structured analysis s, which contains the judgment of the model and explicitly reflects the models understanding of which segments should be trusted. Finally, using this self-assessment, the model produces the answer a. During training, we concatenate the ground-truth rationale Ës produced by prompt template and answer Ëa into single target sequence Ëy = Concat(Ës, Ëa) The model is trained to generate this sequence autoregressively, conditioned on the input = Concat(cÏ(1), . . . , cÏ(n), q). We apply single-language modeling loss over the target: LLM = (cid:88) t=1 log PÎ¸(Ëyt Ëy<t, x), (7) where Ëyt denotes the ground-truth token at position t, and is the model output generated at inference time. This joint fine-tuning scheme enables the model to adapt dynamically to different proportions of inappropriate context, learning not only to identify and reason about context reliability but also to generate robust, context-aware answers in unified framework. To address limitation (3), we mitigate residual contextual bias by training the model on distributions where appropriate information is dominant (fewer than inappropriate segments, i.e., (cid:80) 1[yi = 0] K). By systematically varying the positions Ï(i) of these inappropriate segments and altering the total number of context segments, the model learns to disregard minor contamination across varying context lengths, benefiting from increased data diversity and amount. This targeted fine-tuning helps counteract the negative influence predicted by our adapted RW model even when RW-Steering is imperfect. We use = 3 in our evaluations, though this value can be adjusted to reflect real-world filtering accuracy."

            "content": "Alignment finetuning enhances performance under fixed inappropriate context ratios We begin with the setting where each query includes fixed ratio of inappropriate context. Table 1 shows that direct fine-tuning, either via self-alignment or human preference, consistently improves response quality across all LLMs, and our RW-Steering method offers no clear advantage. This suggests that when context proportions are stable, supervision effectively helps models resist contamination, with consistent gains across architectures. Self-awareness training alone yields limited performance gains We then evaluate self-awareness training, where the model learns to detect inappropriate context without optimizing for generation. As shown in Table 1, this improves the detection of harmful content but yields little or no gain in response quality in addition to the alignment finetuning approach. This suggests that the detection capability alone is insufficient for robust generation. Instead, awareness and response generation must be jointly optimized to achieve improved performance.

This suggests that alignment finetuning overfits to the contamination distribution seen during training and leads to confusion when the context becomes imbalanced. As detailed in Appendix C, this drop can be alleviated through mixed ratio training strategy. However, when the mixed ratios are limited, the resulting models still fail to generalize across the full spectrum of context mixtures, highlighting the limitations of alignment finetuning in real-world settings. Contextual filtering offers lightweight and generalizable but less stable improvements Table 2 and Figure 4 (Middle) shows model behavior before and after applying contextual filtering, which yields lightweight, generalizable improvements without requiring additional labeled data. However, the behavior curves remain unstable across different contamination levels. We hypothesize this is due to residual inappropriate content. When the overall inappropriateness proportion is high, the filtering process is more prone to imperfections. As predicted by our adapted RW model, even small amounts of remaining contamination can disproportionately degrade performance. Thus, while efficient, contextual filtering alone is insufficient under severe context corruption. RW-Steering robustly reverses the undesired behavior curve Table 2 and Figure 4 (Right) show that RW-Steering Fine-Tuning yields consistent performance gains and clearly reverses the previously undesired behavior curve. Unlike contextual filtering, this method trains the model to internally assess context quality and adjust its responses accordingly.

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "This work investigates how LLMs respond to contexts containing mixture of context using an RW model, showing that even minimal inappropriate content can significantly degrade responses and lead to undesirable behavior curves. We introduced RW-Steering, fine-tuning approach enabling LLMs to internally identify and discount such context. Unlike baseline methods, RWSteering generalizes across diverse inappropriate content, significantly improves performance with limited supervision, and reshapes behavior for enhanced robustness. Overall, this work provides insight into how LLMs process and prioritize mixed context and offers practical solution for improving their reliability in real-world settings. In the future, this framework can be extended to agentic LLM applications, where similar strategies could help models dynamically monitor and adapt to contextual risks or inappropriate tool use, ultimately improving their safety and effectiveness in various tasks."

            "title": "7 Limitation",
            "content": "While our findings offer valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, although the observed behavioral patterns and predictive performance support our analogy between ICL and classical conditioning, the connection remains approximate. The Rescorla-Wagner model, while illustrative, is inherently limited in its ability to capture the full complexity of ICL dynamics in large language models. Second, although our constructed dataset is based on real-world examples, it does not fully capture the intricacies of web-scale data. Many contextual signals that exist in real-world information environments may not be represented in our simulation, and the actual distribution and frequency of inappropriate content remain unknown and are not explicitly modeled. Third, due to computational resource constraints, we evaluated our methods on limited set of models. broader evaluation across more architectures and scales may yield further insights and generalization."

However, we acknowledge that the behavioral patterns revealed through our RW-based analysis could be misused to craft adversarial inputs that exploit model vulnerabilities and amplify the injection of inappropriate content. We encourage responsible use of this research and emphasize the importance of deploying such models with proper safeguards and monitoring mechanisms."

            "content": "In this section, we provide more details about how our context testbed is constructed and how we did the verification process. To simulate realistic scenarios, we collected all the inappropriate context from established real-world datasets. Privacy-related data was drawn from the AdultCensus-Income dataset (Pooja2512), which contains demographic and employment details of 32,000 individuals; to address privacy concerns, we manually replaced real names with randomly generated ones. The fake news category is divided into two splits: the first sourced from the LIAR dataset (Wang, 2017), containing 12.8K manually labeled short statements collected from POLITIFACT.COM, and the second consisting of advertisement-style samples manually collected from various service providers. To avoid copyright issues in the second split, we assigned each advertisement to randomly generated, non-existent company name and created corresponding negative user feedback for these companies. Hate speech data was drawn from the ETHOS dataset (Mollas et al., 2022), comprising annotated YouTube and Reddit comments validated through crowdsourcing. Non-factual data was obtained from the Counterfact dataset (Meng et al., 2022), which includes 21,919 counterfactual records based on knowledge base triples. Based on collected real-world data, we used GPT-4o to generate natural queries for each category of inappropriate content. These queries were then used to retrieve relevant real-world information, forming query-linked data samples. Groundtruth references were also generated by GPT-4o, guided to produce accurate and helpful responses. We sampled 100 examples per category, and all generated data were validated by three expert annotatorsprofessional researchers in the fieldwho reviewed the samples to ensure their validity and relevance. This process yielded total of 7,607 individual user queries: 1,470 paired with privacy-related context, 1,964 with fake news, 775 with hate speech, and 3,398 with non-factual information. Each query was originally accompanied by five distinct context pieces, resulting in 45,385 total context entries. By appending different source tags (e.g., website names) or generating synonymous variants, this dataset can be expanded to produce unlimited contextual combinations, enabling the construction of test scenarios with disproportionate amounts of inappropriate content. The dataset statistics are listed in Table 4."

This form of associative learning is exemplified by the iconic experiments of Ivan Pavlov, who demonstrated that dog could learn to salivate (conditioned response, CR) at the sound of bell (conditioned stimulus, CS) if the bell was consistently paired with the presentation of food (unconditioned stimulus, US). Over time, the animal forms mental association between the CS and the US, even in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. framework,"

            "content": "the RescorlaWagner model (Kremer, 1978; Rescorla, 2008) offers formal, quantitative theory of how associative strength between stimuli evolves during learning. Developed in the 1970s by Robert Rescorla and Allan Wagner, the model was one of the first to mathematically describe the dynamic process by which expectations are formed and updated in response to prediction errors, discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes. Specifically, the model posits that learning occurs proportionally to the surprise or unexpectedness of an unconditioned stimulus, and that each stimulus contributes certain weight toward predicting the US. B.2 Similarities Between Animal Association Learning and LLM Prioritization of Context While it is important to acknowledge that animal associative learning and large language model (LLM) context prioritization are fundamentally different in nature, one being dynamic, iterative learning process and the other static, one-shot inference, there are nevertheless striking behavioral parallels between the two. In both cases, the system forms implicit associations between inputs and expected outcomes, and both exhibit sensitivity to the relative salience or novelty of different signals. Just as animals learn to assign greater weight to unexpected or less familiar stimuli during conditioning, LLMs tend to amplify the influence of context elements that are less dominant or more surprising in their current response distribution. These similarities suggest that associative mechanisms, such as those formalized in the RescorlaWagner model, may offer valuable insights into how LLMs internally weigh and integrate contextual information during prediction."

            "content": "In part (1), we directly prompt large language models to observe their output probabilities under different contexts and construct behavior curve based on the responses. To make predictions using the adapted RescorlaWagner model, we sample points from this behavior curve using separate set of prompt inputs. We then infer the coefficients of the RescorlaWagner model through regression. Finally, we use the fitted model to make predictions from the specified starting conditions. During the inference stage, we always set the temperature of the language models to 1.0. In part (2) and part (3), we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed steering approaches on several open-source LLMs, including Phi-2 (Javaheripi et al., 2023), Qwen-2 (Yang et al., 2024a), Gemma2 (Team et al., 2024), and Llama-3.2 (Grattafiori et al., 2024) Models. Due to resource limitations, we did the training and inference on smaller versions of these models (less than 3B). We evaluated the model performance with each baseline approach and our proposed RW-Steering method independently on each split of our poison context testbed. In part (2), we always expose three pieces of relevant and appropriate context and two pieces of inappropriate context to the language model, while in part (3), the total amount of contextual information exposed to language model is set to 20. We use an Adam optimizer with warm up ratio of 0.1 and weight decay of 0.01. We train the model for 4 epochs on single A100 GPU with chunk size of 4096. The batch size is set to 1 and the learning rate is set to 2e-5. C.2 More Qualitative Analysis and Results Table 1 summarizes the main results of all baseline approaches and our RW-Steering method under the setting where LLMs are exposed to proportionate inappropriate context. While this table focuses on the fakenews subset, we include the results for the other three categories: privacy, non-factual, and hatespeech, in Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7, respectively. The results suggest that direct alignment methods tend to perform best in scenarios with proportionate inappropriate context, whereas our approach may introduce additional complexity. Although such settings may be less common in real-world applications and the solutions less generalizable, we also provide qualitative analysis of model behavior under this scenario to support specialized use cases. Impact of alignment finetuning across inappropriate context categories Alignment finetuning exhibits varying effectiveness across different types of inappropriate contexts. Under fake news contamination, all four LLMs showed moderate vulnerability, with baseline cleanliness scores ranging from 50% to 65%. Finetuning consistently improved performance, with the Self-Aligned method slightly outperforming the Human-Aligned approach. This advantage likely stems from the distributional alignment between the models native outputs and selfgenerated targets, facilitating smoother adaptation.

In contrast, privacy-related contexts posed more severe challenges, with baseline cleanliness scores often falling below 40%except for Gemma-2-2b, which demonstrated stronger inherent robustness. Here, Human-Aligned methods led to substantial improvements, frequently surpassing 95% cleanliness. The Self-Aligned method showed only moderate gains, likely due to the implicit nature of privacy-related content, which limits the models ability to infer safe outputs without explicit human supervision. Nonetheless, privacy settings exhibited the largest relative improvements postfinetuning. cleanliness often exceeding 98% and notable consistency gains. The minimal performance gap between tuning methods suggests that simple factual distortionsunlike more complex misinformationare easier for models to correct with minimal behavioral adjustment, making this the most recoverable context type. Finally, hate speech contexts showed high baseline cleanliness (above 85%) across all models, suggesting strong inherent robustness likely due to safety alignment during pretraining. As result, finetuning yielded only marginal improvements, with little difference between methods. This indicates that hate speech resistance is largely established during earlier training, requiring minimal additional tuning. For non-factual contexts, baseline performance was mixed, but alignment finetuning resulted in near-perfect correction across all models, with Overall, our analysis shows that residual errors mainly stem from two factors: (1) content type: RW-Steering is more effective on explicit fake news Table 7: Main results of our RW-Steering approaches when LLMs are faced with contextual information containing fixed mixture of inappropriate content, the following table shows results on the Hatespeech split of our Poison Context Testbed.

However, since real-world contamination levels are unpredictable, this approach lacks generalizability. but struggles with subtle non-factual cues, and (2) contextual load: performance remains stable with up to 20 segments (K = 3), but larger or more imbalanced contexts may require re-tuning. Failures typically occur when the model either retains nuanced harmful signals or mistakenly discounts relevant evidence, highlighting scenarios that remain challenging for future work. Blind spots in self-awareness We observe that adding dedicated training stage to enhance the models self-awareness, specifically its ability to detect inappropriate context, does not consistently improve generation quality compared to alignment finetuning. This reveals critical blind spot in current LLM behavior: while models may accurately recognize harmful or misleading information, they do not reliably act on that recognition. In many cases, the model continues to incorporate inappropriate context into its output, suggesting that awareness alone is insufficient to guide response generation. This decoupling between recognition and behavior points to fundamental limitation in current alignment strategies and highlights the need for integrated approaches that jointly optimize both awareness and action. Recovering the performance drop while training with mixture of context As discussed in Section 3, we observed significant performance drop in LLMs fine-tuned on fixed ratio of inappropriate context when tested on disproportionate mixtures. To address this, we propose mitigation strategy that trains the model on mixture of context ratios spanning the full spectrum of inappropriateness. Specifically, we constructed training dataset with an equal number of examples for each mixture ratio and kept all other training configurations unchanged. As shown in Figure 5, this approach improves robustness to varying contamination levels. However, this method still has limin real-world applications, ited generalizability: context mixtures may follow arbitrary or skewed distributions, and imbalanced training data can lead to prediction shifts and degraded performance. Figure 6: This figure shows the change in the Phi-2 Models behavior curve when exposed to disproportionate contexts, comparing performance before and after applying various fine-tuning approaches. Left (baseline): The models performance declined after applying alignment fine-tuning. Middle (baseline): Context filtering shows general improvement but remains unstable because of the unstable filtering accuracy. Right (ours): Our SelfAlignment approach leads to overall more robust and generalizable performance. Figure 7: This figure shows the change in the Llama-3 Models behavior curve when exposed to disproportionate contexts, comparing performance before and after applying various fine-tuning approaches. Left: The models performance declined after applying alignment fine-tuning. Middle: Context filtering shows general improvement but remains unstable because of the unstable filtering accuracy. Right: Our Self-Alignment approach leads to overall more robust and generalizable performance. Additional Experiments Demonstrating the Effectiveness of RW-Steering We present additional experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of RW-Steering. Specifically, we report results for the Phi-2 model in Figure 6 and Table 8, and for the Llama-3 model in Figure 7 and Table 9. Despite architectural differences, both models exhibit similar behavioral trends. Direct alignment finetuning can sometimes introduce adverse effects, while contextual filtering offers generalizable but less stable solution. In contrast, our RW-Steering method consistently achieves stable performance improvements and produces robust, generalizable behavior curves across range of contamination levels. Verify RW-Pattern on buggy code domain We further examine whether the RW behavioral pattern generalizes to code tasks. Since inappropriateness in programming is less clearly defined in prior literature, we construct synthetic evaluation setting where models must generate function to compute polynomial given several helper code blocks, some of which are deliberately injected with subtle bugs. This setup mirrors real-world scenarios where LLMs encounter redundant or misleading code snippets. As shown in Table 10 , both GPT-3.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct follow the RW behavior curve: performance drops sharply with even small proportions of erroneous code and stabilizes once errors dominate. Notably, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B remains more robust, likely due to its stronger prior knowledge of programming, enabling it to better ignore simple injected errors. Additional Baseline: Non-finetuning (Prompting) Following the reviewers suggestion, we also evaluated non-finetuning baseline using Chainof-Thought style prompt (Please remember that the retrieved information provide may contain inappropriate content. Do not include any inappropriate content in your output.). As shown in Table 11, this approach yields results largely similar to the original With context baseline, with only minor improvements in some cases and even performance drops in others. In contrast, our Context Filtering and RW-Steering methods consistently deliver stronger and more stable performance across proportionate contamination settings. Table 8: Response quality of the Phi-2 model when exposed to increasing levels of inappropriate retrieved content (0% to 95%). While baseline performance steadily declines, both Context Filtering and RW-Steering improve response quality. Notably, RW-Steering consistently achieves much higher and more stable results (bolded), outperforming Context Filtering across all conditions.

            "content": "In-context Learning Abilities of LLMs Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2024). This emergent property (Wei et al., 2022) enables models to effectively incorporate external contextual information, facilitating tasks such as mathematical reasoning (Wei et al., 2023), enhancing interaction with simple retrievers (Rubin et al., 2022), and empowering LLMs to act as intelligent agents capable of utilizing various tools (Qin et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023b) to assist users in diverse tasks (Xi et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b). Despite these advances, LLMs remain susceptible to inappropriate or misleading contexts, which may significantly degrade their performance. Recent studies, such as the needle-in-a-haystack problem (Liu et al., 2024c; Gao et al., 2025), have explored scenarios where LLMs must identify relevant subsets of information amidst noise. However, there is still limited understanding regarding how LLM predictions adapt when particular context types progressively dominate the input. In our work, we aim to refine the understanding of in-context learning by examining how LLMs prioritize competing contextual signals, particularly focusing on their response to mixed helpful and inappropriate content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Context Prioritization Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective method to enhance model performance by retrieving relevant external knowledge and integrating it into model generation processes (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023). While RAG significantly improves the factual accuracy and informativeness of model outputs, its effectiveness can be compromised if retrieved contexts contain misleading or inappropriate information. Although existing work has focused extensively on retrieval quality and mechanisms to enhance retrieval performance, systematic investigations into how retrieved context influences the models internal prioritization during generation remain scarce. Our study addresses this gap by systematically exploring how LLMs output probabilities evolve as certain types of context become more dominant in retrieval results, with critical implications for retrieval-based applications and model reliability. Misinformation Detection Detecting misinformation is long-standing NLP task (Su et al., 2020), broadly encompassing propaganda detection (Martino et al., 2020), hate speech identification (Jahan and Oussalah, 2023), and fake news classification (Oshikawa et al., 2018). Traditionally, these tasks involve assigning binary or categorical labels to identify misinformation explicitly. Recently, large language models have been leveraged for comprehensive misinformation analysis (Liu et al., 2024a), yet few studies have considered whether accurate misinformation detection translates effectively into downstream generation tasks, especially in contexts where misinformation must be actively ignored. In contrast, our work explicitly seeks to extend misinformation detection capabilities into generation tasks, enabling LLMs not merely to recognize misinformation but also to minimize its influence during contextualized generation. Needle-in-a-Haystack Problem. The closest line of work to ours is the needle-in-a-haystack problem (Liu et al., 2024c; Gao et al., 2025), which evaluates models ability to retrieve and attend to small relevant snippet within large, mostly irrelevant context. These studies highlight LLMs robustness to noise and their retrieval sensitivity when useful information is sparsely embedded. In contrast, our work focuses on complementary aspect: we systematically analyze how the models output probability for specific piece of context evolves as its dominance increases within the input. This allows us to characterize the models internal prioritization mechanism when exposed to mixed or competing contextual signals, offering new insights into LLM behavior beyond noise tolerance."
