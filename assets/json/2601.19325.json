            "content": "In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly [Bai et al., 2025a, An et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2024a, Team et al., 2025a,b, Zhu et al., 2025], driven by the scaling of model parameters [Liu et al., 2024a, Team et al., 2025c], the availability of large-scale multimodal data, and improvements in training paradigms. By jointly modeling visual and textual information, these models are able to perceive and reason, enabling wide range of applications that were previously difficult to address with unimodal systems. As result, MLLMs have demonstrated strong performance on diverse tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, visual grounding, document understanding, and multimodal reasoning, highlighting their growing importance as general-purpose intelligent systems [Wen et al., 2025a]. Despite these impressive advances, scientific-domain tasks remain particularly challenging and underexplored [Zhang et al., 2023]. Scientific problems often require precise understanding, rigorous multi-step reasoning, and the ability to integrate domain knowledge across modalities, making them substantially more demanding than general multimodal tasks. Importantly, strong performance on scientific tasks is widely regarded as crucial milestone toward building artificial general intelligence (AGI) and scientific general intelligence (SGI), as it reflects models capacity for systematic reasoning and knowledge-intensive problem solving. However, existing multimodal large language models, especially open-source models, still struggle to achieve performance in scientific tasks comparable to that observed on general-purpose benchmarks, revealing significant gap between current capabilities and the requirements of scientific reasoning. Recognizing this challenge, researchers in both academia and industry have begun to devote increasing attention to scientific multimodal understanding and reasoning, leading to number of recent advances. Several scientific-oriented multimodal large language models [Bai et al., 2025b, Zhong et al., 2024, Liao et al., 2025a] and benchmarks [Li et al., 2025a, Zhao et al., 2025a, Shen et al., 2024] have been proposed to 3 enhance performance on tasks involving mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other STEM domains. These efforts demonstrate the potential of multimodal models in scientific problem solving and represent important steps toward bridging the gap between general-purpose perception and scientific domain-specific reasoning. While these efforts have led to encouraging progress, many existing approaches rely on large-scale or highly specialized scientific datasets, making them expensive to reproduce and difficult to extend. In addition, the training pipelines of several systems are either partially opaque or tightly coupled with task-specific heuristics, limiting reproducibility and broader adoption by the community. Moreover, improvements on scientific benchmarks often come at the cost of degraded performance on general multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, suggesting lack of balanced generalization. Motivated by these observations, we present Innovator-VL, scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance multimodal understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains. In contrast to prior approaches that depend on massive domain-specific data or opaque training pipelines, Innovator-VL adopts principled and fully transparent training framework that emphasizes data efficiency, reproducibility, and balanced generalization. Specifically, we use RICE-ViT [Xie et al., 2025] as the visual encoder for Innovator-VL. Scientific understanding in multimodal settings critically depends on the accurate perception of structured visual elements, such as symbols, annotations, and relational components. By capturing finegrained, region-level semantics, RICE-ViT decomposes scientific images into semantically coherent visual units, enabling faithful alignment between visual entities and scientific concepts. This structured visual representation significantly reduces the burden on downstream language reasoning modules, facilitating more reliable scientific reasoning. Following the design of the QwenVL series [Bai et al., 2025a, Wang et al., 2024a], we adopt PatchMerger as the vision-language projector. This design effectively balances representational capacity and computational efficiency by merging visual patches into compact yet semantically informative representation. Considering that Qwen3-8B-Base [Yang et al., 2025a] has been extensively pre-trained on broad and diverse corpus, we adopt it as the language decoder for Innovator-VL. During Pre-training, we focus on robust language-image alignment and high-quality knowledge injection using LLaVA-1.5 558k [Liu et al., 2024b] and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Training-85M [An et al., 2025]. Given that Qwen3-8B-Base has already undergone extensive pretraining and high-quality scientific-domain data is unavailable, we did not further pretrain the language model on scientific texts or include scientific data in the multimodal pretraining stage. In the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we prioritize data quality over quantity. We construct high-quality, human-in-the-loop synthetic data pipelines for multiple specialized scientific domains (e.g., in-the-wild OCSR, chemical reaction understanding, and microstructural characterization). Using less than 5 million scientific samples, Innovator-VL achieves competitive performance among models of comparable size. Meanwhile, we incorporate data with chain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning to prepare the model for solving complex scientific problems and the subsequent RL stage. Finally, to bridge the gap between the models latent reasoning capabilities and consistent performance, we introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL). We curate discrepancy-driven RL dataset and employ Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) [Zheng et al., 2025] to optimize long-horizon reasoning paths, guided by hierarchical reward system that enforces both structural format and semantic accuracy. In summary, our work and practice make three main contributions: We present Innovator-VL, fully transparent and end-to-end reproducible training recipe for scientific multimodal modeling, facilitating further exploration of scientific multimodal large language models by the research community. Innovator-VL demonstrates remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance across wide range of scientific tasks using fewer than five million carefully curated high-quality scientific samples, despite not relying on large-scale scientific-domain pretraining. Innovator-VL exhibits strong capability beyond scientific domains, attaining competitive performance among multimodal large language models of comparable size on general vision benchmarks, multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific reasoning enhancement can be effectively incorporated into multimodal models without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Figure 2 Overall architecture of our native-resolution multi-image reasoning model. Given text prompt and multiple images with heterogeneous resolutions, RICE-ViT encodes each image at its native size, producing variable-length visual token sequences. Patch Merger then aggregates the visual tokens into compact sequence that is concatenated with text tokens and fed into Qwen-8B-base to generate the final response with explicit reasoning."

            "content": "We adopt RICE-ViT [Xie et al., 2025], Vision Transformer variant designed for region-aware representation learning. Unlike CLIP [Radford et al., 2021] or SigLIP [Zhai et al., 2023, Tschannen et al., 2025] that primarily focus on global patch interactions, RICE-ViT integrates region-level semantics through specialized Region Transformer layer, enabling the model to capture both holistic and localized visual cues within single forward pass. This is particularly important for scientific imagery, where fine-grained structures, dense labels, and spatially localized patterns frequently occur. The region-aware cluster discrimination mechanism used in RICE-ViT facilitates richer semantic embedding by jointly optimizing object and OCR region representations, which improves downstream tasks such as grounding, dense prediction, and multimodal reasoning. Existing studies have shown that RICE-ViT consistently outperforms traditional visual backbones across diverse visual tasks, including segmentation and dense detection. By integrating RICE-ViT as our vision encoder, Innovator-VL benefits from enhanced visual representation capacity that is well aligned with the demands of scientific multimodal understanding and reasoning."

The PatchMerger module is specifically introduced to address 5 Figure 3 Data distribution across different training stages.

(c) Distribution of data sources within the Innovator-VL-RL-172K dataset. the quadratic computational cost associated with processing dense visual tokens from the Vision Transformer. By learning to merge larger set of input patch embeddings into smaller set of representative tokens, PatchMerger significantly reduces the token sequence length that downstream components must process, leading to substantial reductions in computational complexity and memory usage. Empirical studies on token compression [Liao et al., 2025b, Wen et al., 2025b] have demonstrated that such learned merger modules can achieve significant efficiency gains with negligible accuracy degradation on both upstream and downstream tasks [Zhang et al., 2025a, Liu et al., 2025a, Han et al., 2024, Wen et al., 2025c,d, Liu et al., 2025b]. In the context of multimodal integration, this compression facilitates more efficient cross-modal interaction with the language model without compromising the richness of visual representations, which is particularly important when training on limited scientific datasets. By adopting PatchMerger as the projector, InnovatorVL achieves favorable balance between computational efficiency and representational fidelity, enabling scalable multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding."

Without access to high-quality and diverse scientific data, further pretraining on scientific texts could introduce bias and overfitting to some domains. At the same time, our goal is for Innovator-VL to excel in scientific tasks while maintaining its general capabilities, with robust and reliable foundation in visual understanding serving as the cornerstone for higher-level scientific reasoning. This philosophy extends naturally to the multimodal pretraining stage. In the first stage, Language-Image Alignment, we train our projector using the LLaVA-1.5 558k [Liu et al., 2024b] dataset, aiming to align visual features with the word embedding space of the LLM. Building upon this alignment stage, we introduce the High-quality Mid-Training. In this stage, we transition to full-parameter training across all modules. We employ the LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Training dataset [An et al., 2025], large-scale multimodal corpus specifically designed to enhance the foundation ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This dataset comprises approximately 85 million highquality image-text pairs, including 65 million English and 20 million Chinese samples. The data are curated from diverse array of prominent sources, including COYO-700M [Byeon et al., 2022], Obelics [Laurençon et al., 2023], DataComp-1B [Gadre et al., 2023], LAION-CN [Zhang et al., 2022], ImageNet-21K [Russakovsky et al., 2015], SAM-1B [Kirillov et al., 2023], MINT [Wang et al., 2023], and Zero250M [Xie et al., 2023]. key characteristic of this dataset is the integration of feature-based concept-balanced sampling strategy. To address the challenges of missing annotations or suboptimal caption quality (e.g., the brief and incomplete labels in COYO-700M or caption-free nature of SAM-1B), the dataset construction process moves beyond traditional raw text matching. Instead, it utilizes the pre-trained MetaCLIP-H/14-Full-CC2.5B [Xu et al., 2023] encoders to project both images and taxonomy of 500,000 concepts into shared embedding space. By retrieving the top-𝐾 nearest concept embeddings for each image, refined pseudo-captions are generated. This methodology ensures semantic diversity and balance across the massive-scale data, ultimately facilitating more robust and fine-grained visual-language alignment during pre-training."

            "content": "To further empower the model to address wide spectrum of visual tasks with precise and appropriate responses, we continue to perform full-parameter visual instruction fine-tuning on the model. At this stage, we pursue three objectives. First, we endow the model with fundamental visual instruction-following capability, enabling it to leverage the knowledge acquired during pretraining to solve general multimodal understanding tasks. Second, to prepare for the subsequent reinforcement learning stage, we perform cold start by equipping the model with preliminary chain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning abilities. Third, and most importantly, we strengthen the models scientific understanding, training it to effectively high-quality scientific corpora. Due to ongoing data compliance review procedures, this version is not yet available for public release. 7 Figure 4 Data Construction Pipeline. The raw data are obtained from both synthetic generation and real-world sources. For each data modality (EM representations, images, and questions), domain experts apply modality-specific inspection and refinement strategies. Through repeated iterative optimization, final high-quality dataset is produced. solve problems in scientific domains. To this end, we curate three categories of training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), including general multimodal instruction data, chain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning data, and scientific understanding data. 4.1.1 General Multimodal Instruction Data We employ the LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct dataset [An et al., 2025], which consolidates diverse collection of instruction-tuning data from multiple sources. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure balanced coverage across wide range of categories, including Caption, Chart & Table, Code & Math, General VQA, Grounding & Counting, OCR. This dataset contains approximately 22 million samples. The strong performance of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 on general vision benchmarks empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of this data. 4.1.2 Chain-of-Thought and Multi-step Reasoning Data Compared to general multimodal tasks, scientific tasks are inherently more challenging. Therefore, in the visual instruction fine-tuning stage, we not only employ general multimodal instruction data but also introduce data with chain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning annotations. This design enables the model to acquire reasoning patterns at this stage, laying solid foundation for tackling complex scientific reasoning tasks as well as for the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Concretely, we adopt large-scale reasoningoriented instruction dataset Honey-Data-15M [Zhang et al., 2025b] containing approximately 15 million samples. The dataset spans wide range of domains and is specifically designed to elicit chain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning behaviors. Different from the original dataset, we further refine the data by removing large number of explicit think tags. We find that such heavily templated markers may introduce undesirable noise during training; their removal helps preserve the underlying reasoning structure while encouraging more natural and robust reasoning patterns. 4.1.3 Scientific Understanding Data To enhance the models generalizable understanding and cross-domain robustness on scientific tasks, we synthesize high-quality datasets across diverse scientific domains. Our data construction philosophy emphasizes principled methodology, systematic quality control, and domain-specific refinement strategies. To illustrate this approach, we present three representative scientific subfields as exemplars: in-the-wild optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR), chemical reaction understanding from scientific literature, and microstructural characterization from electron micrographs (EM). For each subfield, we develop dedicated data construction and quality control pipeline that systematically integrates data generation, filtering, and consistency verification, demonstrating our generalizable framework for scientific data synthesis. The overall data processing pipeline is illustrated in Figure 4. Optical chemical structure recognition (in-the-wild OCSR). low-cost, large-scale paired training corpus is developed via human-in-the-loop data engine with two stages: (i) synthetic bootstrapping; (ii) active-learning-driven expansion on real-world data. To represent patent-prevalent yet SMILES-inexpressible structures (e.g., Markush patterns and connectivity constraints), E-SMILES is adopted as unified annotation format, written as SMILESsepEXTENSION, where EXTENSION uses compact XML-like tokens to encode R-groups and connectivity information while remaining RDKit-compatible and sequence-model-friendly. The initial model is trained on 7M synthesized and rendered paired molecular structure imagesE-SMILES samples, and subsequently expanded with real patent/paper PDFs through detection, cropping, and deduplication. Confidence is estimated via 5-fold ensemble and SMILES-similarity scoring, and mid-confidence samples (0.60.9) are prioritized for expert correction. The pipeline iterates in closed loop of model pre-annotationhuman verificationperiodic retraining, enabling scalable acquisition of high-quality real annotations and progressive alignment to real-world distributions. Chemical reaction understanding from scientific literature. To systematically evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in realistic PDF-based reaction-reading scenarios, hierarchical benchmark is curated to cover both single-figure fine-grained perception and full-document cross-modal reasoning. High-impact open-access papers from the past five years are selected to ensure broad reaction diversity and authentic document complexity. Reaction schemes are extracted via PDF layout parsing and automatic cropping (retaining titles and label regions). QA pairs are generated in human-in-the-loop manner: candidates are proposed by large model and subsequently reviewed and refined by domain experts to ensure chemical consistency and verifiability. Expert-driven adversarial distractor design further yields chemically plausible, visually dependent hard negatives, while verification mechanisms such as None of the Above are incorporated to suppress guess-based hallucinations and improve benchmark robustness. Microstructural characterization from electron micrographs (EM). The EM dataset is assembled at scale with dense instance-level segmentation annotations and structured textual descriptions to support microstructure segmentation and generation. Multi-source real EM data are aggregated and cleaned via deduplication and quality filtering, while non-structural regions (e.g., watermarks and instrument text) are cropped to obtain cleaner and more consistent visual distribution. nine-dimensional, attribute-disentangled description schema is introduced, leveraging multi-model independent extraction with cross-validation followed by expert adjudication for accuracy and interpretability. Instance segmentation annotations are produced through high-performance annotation platform and human-in-the-loop iterative workflow, forming closed loop of expert seed labelingmodel pseudo-label generationhuman refinementmulti-stage quality control to enable scalable construction of high-confidence annotations."

            "content": "To further strengthen the models multimodal reasoning and its capacity to tackle complex scientific problems, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to Innovator-VL-8B-Instruct. 4.2.1 RL Data We curate specialized RL training dataset, Innovator-VL-RL-172K. Our construction pipeline integrates discrepancy-driven selection, reward-based filtering, and rigorous format standardization. Discrepancy-Driven Selection and Filtering. We view RL primarily as an elicitation mechanism rather than knowledge injection. Consequently, our data selection targets the models \"effective learnable boundary.\" We 9 measure the divergence between Pass@N and Pass@1 performance across candidate samples; significant gap indicates that while the model possesses the potential to generate correct solutions (high Pass@N), its policy fails to reliably prioritize them (low Pass@1). To ensure high training efficiency, we further employ reward-based sampling strategy. We generate multiple response candidates for each instance and filter based on average reward scores, retaining only medium-difficulty instances. This effectively removes trivial samples the model has already mastered and unsolvable cases beyond its current grasp. Standardization and Composition. Raw data sourced from diverse public datasources [An et al., 2025, Zhang et al., 2025c, Xu et al., 2025, Deng et al., 2025, Qiao et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2025a, Li et al., 2025b] often suffers from inconsistent answer styles and reasoning structures. To mitigate training instability, we standardize all collected samples into unified reasoning format, normalizing textual structures and ensuring consistent stepwise outputs. The resulting curated corpus contains approximately 172K instances. As illustrated in Figure 3, the dataset is heavily weighted towards complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, STEM & Code represents the majority share at 56.4%, followed by General multimodal tasks at 34.9%. To ensure comprehensive coverage of fine-grained capabilities, the dataset also includes specific subsets for Science (5.0%), Spatial reasoning (2.4%), Grounding (0.9%), Counting (0.2%), and OCR & Diagram understanding (0.2%). 4.2.2 Optimization Algorithm To effectively train Innovator-VL on complex reasoning tasks requiring long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paths, we employ Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) [Zheng et al., 2025]. While previous group-based methods like GRPO apply token-level importance weights to sequence-level rewards, this mismatch can introduce high-variance noise and instability during training. GSPO addresses this by strictly aligning the optimization unit with the reward unit, performing importance sampling and clipping at the sequence level. GSPO optimizes the policy 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the expected reward of generated response groups while constraining the update using sequence-level trust region. The objective function is defined as: JGSPO(𝜃) = E𝑥D,{ 𝑦𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖= 𝜋𝜃 old ( 𝑥 ) (cid:34) 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖=1 (cid:16) min 𝑠𝑖 (𝜃) (cid:98)𝐴𝑖, clip(𝑠𝑖 (𝜃), 1 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖) (cid:98)𝐴𝑖 (cid:35) (cid:17) , (1) where 𝐺 is the group size, and (cid:98)𝐴𝑖 is the normalized advantage for the 𝑖-th response derived from the reward 𝑟(𝑥, 𝑦𝑖). key innovation of GSPO is the definition of the importance ratio 𝑠𝑖 (𝜃), which is based on the length-normalized sequence likelihood: 𝑠𝑖 (𝜃) = (cid:18) 𝜋𝜃( 𝑦𝑖𝑥) 𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑦𝑖𝑥) old (cid:19) 1 𝑦𝑖 . (2) By utilizing this sequence-level objective, GSPO eliminates the inconsistency of token-level updates in previous algorithms, ensuring robust convergence and superior efficiency when scaling RL to the longcontext reasoning tasks present in our dataset. 4.2.3 Reward System To facilitate deep reasoning capabilities, we explicitly instruct the model to separate its internal thought process from the final conclusion. All RL training instances are formatted with the following instruction: Instruction: thinking and analysis procedure within <think>...</think>. Put ONLY your final answer within <answer>...</answer>. Think and solve the following question step by step. Please put your To ensure the generated responses are both structurally compliant and factually correct, we design comprehensive reward function 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦) that integrates format adherence with hierarchical accuracy verification process. The total reward is calculated as weighted sum: 10 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝛼 𝑟 format + (1 𝛼) 𝑟accuracy. (3) where we empirically set the weighting factor 𝛼 = 0.1 to prioritize reasoning correctness while maintaining structural discipline. Format Reward (𝑟format). To facilitate stable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and multi-step reasoning, we enforce strict output structure. The model receives format reward of 1.0 if the response follows the specific XML-like template <think>...</think>, <answer>...</answer> or employs standard mathematical formatting like boxed{}. Partial credit (e.g., 0.8) is assigned if the response contains mathematical reasoning and discernible answer but lacks precise formatting tags, while completely unstructured outputs receive score of 0.0. Accuracy Reward (𝑟accuracy). Correctness verification is the core of our reward system. Given the diversity of tasks (e.g., multiple-choice, math, open-ended QA), we employ hierarchical verification strategy that balances computational efficiency with semantic understanding. The process proceeds in three cascading stages: 1. Heuristic & Rule-Based Matching: We first extract the answer candidate using regular expressions (targeting <answer> tags or boxed{}). For Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs), we utilize an extensive pattern-matching algorithm to handle various output styles (e.g., (A), The answer is A, Option A). For general text, we apply relaxed string matching to account for minor variations in punctuation or spacing. 2. Symbolic Verification: If exact matching fails for mathematical problems, we employ symbolic verification tool (using math_verify) to parse both the ground truth and the prediction. This allows us to verify mathematical equivalence (e.g., recognizing that 1 2 is equivalent to 0.5) which simple string matching would miss. 3. LLM-as-a-Judge: For open-ended questions or cases where deterministic methods yield negative result, we utilize strong external LLM (e.g., Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct [Yang et al., 2025a, Chen et al., 2024a]) as final judge. The judge is prompted with strict evaluation protocol to output binary score (0 or 1) based on semantic alignment with the ground truth, ignoring trivial formatting differences. This cascaded approach ensures that clear, deterministic answers are rewarded cheaply and quickly, while complex semantic matches are accurately captured by the model-based judge."

            "content": "During the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stages of Innovator-VL, our training pipeline is built upon AIAK-Training-LLM, robust distributed training framework derived from Megatron-LM [Shoeybi et al., 2019]. To maximize computational throughput and memory efficiency, we employ suite of advanced optimization strategies, including the Transformer Engine for accelerating mixed-precision computation, distributed optimizer parallelism, and selective activation recomputation to significantly reduce memory overhead. This high-performance training infrastructure serves as the backbone of our pre-training and SFT stages, enabling efficient and scalable learning over massive multimodal datasets. Following LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 [An et al., 2025], we adopt data packing strategy to further improve training efficiency. In large-scale multimodal training, substantial variation in sequence lengths leads to significant computational redundancy caused by excessive padding. To address this issue and improve GPU utilization, we employ carefully designed offline data packing strategy. Specifically, instead of dynamically collating samples at runtime, we pre-optimize the data layout through parallelized, bucketbased algorithm that groups and concatenates multiple short instances into dense, contiguous sequences. This An enterprise-grade optimization of Megatron-LM provided by Baidu Cloud. 11 global preprocessing step enables more effective utilization of the context window while minimizing padding overhead. As result, our approach substantially improves training throughput and overall computational efficiency. To overcome the efficiency bottlenecks inherent in synchronous RL training, where the optimization process is frequently blocked by time-consuming inference, we utilize AReaL [Fu et al., 2025], high-throughput asynchronous reinforcement learning framework. By fundamentally decoupling the Rollout phase from the Learning phase, AReaL transforms the training pipeline into non-blocking producer-consumer system. This architecture allows dedicated inference workers to continuously produce long-horizon reasoning trajectories, filling the replay buffer without stalling the trainer nodes. Consequently, the learner can perform gradient updates in parallel with data generation, ensuring near-100% GPU utilization and drastically reducing the wall-clock time required for convergence on complex reasoning tasks."

            "content": "Beyond the accuracy improvements demonstrated in Section 6, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable efficiency in reasoning token consumption. As shown in Figure 5 (a), Innovator-VL-8B-Thinking generates significantly shorter reasoning chains compared to Intern-S1-mini [Bai et al., 2025b] and MiMo-VL-7B-RL [Xiaomi, 2025]. Specifically, our model consumes approximately 62% to 66% fewer tokens than Intern-S1-mini and 18% to 48% fewer than MiMo-VL across the three benchmarks. On WeMath, for instance, our model requires merely 564 average tokens, whereas Intern-S1-mini needs 1,640 tokens. More importantly, as illustrated in Figure 5 (b), Innovator-VL-8B-Thinking achieves substantially higher accuracy-to-token ratios across all benchmarks, indicating superior reasoning efficiency. Our model delivers approximately 1.4 to 2 higher accuracy-to-token ratio than MiMo-VL-7B-RL and 3.9 to 4.3 higher than Intern-S1-mini. This metric directly captures the effectiveness of each token consumed during reasoning: 14 higher values indicate that the model extracts more useful information per token, rather than generating redundant or irrelevant content. This efficiency advantage stems from our reinforcement learning stage that explicitly optimizes for both correctness and conciseness. During RL training, the model learns to identify critical reasoning steps and bypass redundant computations, forming compact yet effective reasoning pathways. This capability is particularly valuable for scientific applications where lengthy inference chains not only incur computational costs but also risk accumulating errors. Compared to recent trends that pursue performance through extensive test-time computation scaling, which often incurs prohibitive token costs, Innovator-VL demonstrates that superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs can be achieved through principled post-training recipes. Such efficient reasoning ability makes our model more practical for real-world deployment, especially in resourceconstrained research environments [Chen et al., 2025] and latency-sensitive applications [Xiong et al., 2025, Yang et al., 2025b, He et al., 2025]."

            "content": "A.1 Qualitative Case Study To better illustrate the practical strengths of our approach beyond aggregate benchmark scores, we present curated set of representative cases sampled from the evaluation benchmarks. For each case, our trained model produces the correct answer, while other baseline models fail under the same evaluation setting. We report the original question (and associated image/figure when applicable), together with the full model responses, to highlight where our models ability aligns with the task requirements and where competing methods break down. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive; rather, they provide qualitative evidence of improved robustness and generalization in challenging scenarios.

Answer 5 Innovator-VL-8B-Thinking Model Output To determine the number of triangles in the given image, lets break it down step by step: Step 1: Analyze the overall structure The image depicts simple stick figure with dress. The dress has triangular skirt, and there are other triangular shapes in the figures head and body. Step 2: Identify individual triangles 1. Head: The bow on top of the head is composed of two triangles. The face itself does not contain any triangles, but the eyes and mouth are simple shapes. 2. Dress: The skirt of the dress is large triangle. 3. Body: There are no additional triangles in the body beyond the dress. 4. Feet: Each foot is triangle. Step 3: Count the triangles Bow: 2 triangles (one for each half of the bow). Skirt: 1 triangle. Feet: 2 triangles (one for each foot). Step 4: Sum up all the triangles Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. 26 Final Answer: MiniCPM-V4.5 (8B) Model Output 5 Lets analyze the image to find all the triangles: 1. First, look at the girls bow on her head. The bow is triangle shape. 2. Next, consider the dress. The main part of the dress (the green section without the belt) has triangular lower part that forms an upside-down triangle. Now, lets count each distinct triangle: The pink bow on top of her head is one triangle. The bottom part of the green dress (the skirt area) is another triangle. Are there any other triangles? Lets check each part again: Her face features: eyes and mouth are circles and lines, not triangles. Arms and legs are straight lines (rectangles or trapezoids). Belt is rectangle. Hair is curved but does not form triangle in this stylized drawing. So, only the bow and the bottom part of the dress are triangles. InternVL3.5-8B Model Output So, lets count the triangles in the picture step by step. First, Ill look at the obvious large triangles and then check for smaller ones. 1. The bow on the head: There are two large triangles forming the bow. 2. The dress: The dress has large triangle shape on the top part. 3. The skirt: The skirt has large triangle shape. 4. The arms: Each arm is triangle, and there are two arms. 5. The legs: Each leg is triangle, and there are two legs. 6. The feet: Each foot is triangle, and there are two feet. 7. The buttons: The buttons on the dress are circles, so they dont count as triangles. Wait, let me recount to make sure didnt miss any: Bow: 2 triangles Dress top: 1 triangle Skirt: 1 triangle Arms: 2 triangles Legs: 2 triangles Feet: 2 triangles Adding them up: Hmm, maybe missed some smaller triangles. Lets check again: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10. The bow has 2 large triangles. The dress top is 1 large triangle. The skirt is 1 large triangle. Each arm is 1 triangle, so 2 triangles. Each leg is 1 triangle, so 2 triangles. Each foot is 1 triangle, so 2 triangles. 27 That still totals 10. But wait, maybe there are more small triangles in the design. Lets see: The bow might have smaller triangles inside, but they seem to be part of the larger shape. The dress might have some hidden triangles, but dont see any. think 10 is the correct count. Let me confirm once more: Bow: 2 Dress top: 1 Skirt: 1 Arms: 2 Legs: 2 Feet: 2 Total: So, the total number of triangles should be 10. 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10. Answer: Case 2 Question Five sparrows are sitting on rope (see picture). Some of them are looking to the left, some of them are looking to the right. Every sparrow whistles as many times as the number of sparrows he can see sitting in front of him. For example, the third sparrow whistles exactly twice. How often do all sparrows whistle altogether? Answer 10 Innovator-VL-8B-Thinking Model Output To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times each sparrow whistles based on the number of sparrows it can see in front of it. Lets analyze the situation step by step. Step 1: Understand the Problem There are 5 sparrows sitting on rope. Each sparrow whistles as many times as the number of sparrows it can see in front of it. We need to calculate the total number of whistles from all sparrows. Step 2: Analyze Each Sparrow Lets label the sparrows from left to right as 𝑆1, 𝑆2, 𝑆3, 𝑆4, and 𝑆5. Sparrow 𝑆1: It can see 0 sparrows in front of it, so it whistles 0 times. Sparrow 𝑆2: It can see 1 sparrow (𝑆1) in front of it, so it whistles 1 time. Sparrow 𝑆3: It can see 2 sparrows (𝑆1 and 𝑆2) in front of it, so it whistles 2 times. Sparrow 𝑆4: It can see 3 sparrows (𝑆1, 𝑆2, and 𝑆3) in front of it, so it whistles 3 times. Sparrow 𝑆5: It can see 4 sparrows (𝑆1, 𝑆2, 𝑆3, and 𝑆4) in front of it, so it whistles 4 times. Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Whistles 𝑆1 : 0 𝑆2 : 1 𝑆3 : 2 𝑆4 : 3 𝑆5 : 4 Total whistles = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. 10 Qwen3-VL-8B Model Output Lets analyze the problem step by step. We are given five sparrows sitting on rope, and each sparrow whistles as many times as the number of sparrows it can see sitting in front of him. The key is the interpretation of in front of him, which depends on the direction each sparrow is facing. Looking at the image: The first sparrow (leftmost) is waving with its left hand, suggesting it is facing right. The second sparrow is waving with its right hand, suggesting it is facing left. The third sparrow is waving with its left hand, suggesting it is facing right. The fourth sparrow is waving with its right hand, suggesting it is facing left. The fifth sparrow (rightmost) is waving with its left hand, suggesting it is facing right. So the sparrows alternate in direction: right, left, right, left, right. Odd-numbered sparrows (𝑆1, 𝑆3, 𝑆5) face right; even-numbered sparrows (𝑆2, 𝑆4) face left. Now, for sparrow facing right, in front means to the right; for sparrow facing left, in front means to the left. Therefore: Sparrow 𝑆1 (facing right) sees 𝑆2, 𝑆3, 𝑆4, 𝑆5: 4 sparrows whistles 4 times. Sparrow 𝑆2 (facing left) sees 𝑆1: 1 sparrow whistles 1 time. Sparrow 𝑆3 (facing right) sees 𝑆4, 𝑆5: 2 sparrows whistles 2 times. Sparrow 𝑆4 (facing left) sees 𝑆3: 1 sparrow whistles 1 time. Sparrow 𝑆5 (facing right) sees none: 0 sparrows whistles 0 times. The statement For example, the third sparrow whistles exactly twice. matches this calculation for 𝑆3. Thus the total number of whistles is: 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 8. Answer: 8 MiMo-VL-7B-RL Model Output Lets analyze this step-by-step: 1. Identify which sparrows are looking left and which are looking right. From the image: Sparrows 1 and 3 are looking left. Sparrows 2, 4, and 5 are looking right. 29 2. Calculate how many times each sparrow whistles. Sparrow 1 (looking left): can see 2 sparrows in front of him (2 and 3) whistles 2 times. Sparrow 2 (looking right): can see 3 sparrows in front of him (3, 4, and 5) whistles times. Sparrow 3 (looking left): can see 2 sparrows in front of him (4 and 5) whistles 2 times. Sparrow 4 (looking right): can see 1 sparrow in front of him (5) whistles 1 time. Sparrow 5 (looking right): can see 0 sparrows in front of him whistles 0 times. 3. Sum up the whistles. 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 8. Therefore, all sparrows whistle total of 8 times. A.1.3 Scientific Tasks Case 1 Question Please write the Extended SMILES (E-SMILES) of the given molecule image. Below is the definition of Extended SMILES (E-SMILES) Format Writing Rules: The Extended SMILES (E-SMILES) format used in the MolParser paper is designed to augment standard RDKit-compatible SMILES string with additional machine-readable annotations, especially useful for representing Markush structures, abstract rings, repeating groups, and other extensions commonly seen in chemical patents. The general form of an E-SMILES string is: SMILES<sep>EXTENSION Components: 1. SMILES This is valid RDKit-compatible SMILES string. To ensure consistency, the atom indexing starts from 0. You can generate this using RDKit with rootedAtAtom=0. 2. <sep> special delimiter separating the base SMILES string from the extension part. 3. EXTENSION The extension part contains structured XML-like tokens providing additional information. These tokens annotate atom positions, ring positions, and other special features. There are three types of tags: <a>ATOM_INDEX:[GROUP_NAME]</a> attaches group to specific atom. <r>RING_INDEX:[GROUP_NAME]</r> attaches group to any position on ring. <c>CIRCLE_INDEX:[CIRCLE_NAME]</c> defines abstract repeating rings. special token <dum> can be used to represent connection point. Definitions: ATOM_INDEX: Index of the atom in the SMILES string (starting from 0). RING_INDEX: Index of the ring in the molecule (starting from 0). CIRCLE_INDEX: Index of the abstract repeating ring (starting from 0). GROUP_NAME: The name of the substituent or group, which may be: standard group: R, X, Y, Z, Ph, Me, OMe, CF3, etc. An arbitrary or custom-defined group with superscripts or subscripts, e.g., R[1], X[2], R1, R3. Examples: 1. *c1ccccc1<sep><a>0:R[1]</a> Adds substituent R[1] to atom 0. 2. clccecc1<sep><r>0:R[1]</r><r>0:R[2]</r> Adds two substituents R[1], R[2] to ring 0. 3. *C1*C(*)C(C(*)C2=CC=N=C2)N=1<sep><a>0:R[4]</a><a>1:X</a><r>1:R[5]</r> Complex structure with atom-level and ring-level substitutions. 4. *c(NC(*)C(*)C(*)C(*)C(=O)N(*)<sep> <a>0:R[1]</a><a>2:R[3]</a><a>5:R[2]</a> <a>7:R[5]</a><a>8:R[4]</a><c>0:B</c> <a>13:R[7]</a><a>14:R[6]</a> Shows the usage of abstract ring <c>, with multiple atom-level substitutions.

Lets break down the structure: SMILES String The SMILES representation of the molecule is: CN1N=C2CCCC2=C1C(=O)N1CCN(C(=O)[C@@H]2C[C@H]2[N+](=O)[O-])CC Extensions In this molecule, there are no explicit substituents or abstract rings that require additional annotations beyond the standard SMILES. Therefore, the E-SMILES will only include the SMILES string. 31 E-SMILES CN1N=C2CCCC2=C1C(=O)N1CCN(C(=O)[C@@H]2C[C@H]2[N+](=O)[O-])CC1<sep> This E-SMILES string follows the format by providing the SMILES and an empty extension part, as no further annotations are needed for this structure. Intern-S1-mini (9B) Model Output To write the Extended SMILES (E-SMILES) of the given molecule, we need to follow the rules provided. Heres step-by-step breakdown: 1. SMILES Representation: First, we need to write the SMILES string for the given molecule. The SMILES string for the molecule is: CN1N=C2CCCC2=C1C(=O)N1CCCN(C(=O)[C@@H]2C[C@H]2[N+]([O-])=O)CC1 2. Extension Part: Next, we need to add the extension part to the SMILES string. The extension part contains structured XML-like tokens providing additional information. Atom Indexing: We need to identify the atom indices where we want to attach groups. In this case, we can attach groups to the nitrogen atom in the pyrazole ring (atom index 0) and the nitrogen atom in the piperazine ring (atom index 1). Group Names: We can use standard group names like R, X, Y, Z, Ph, Me, OMe, CF3, etc. For this example, lets use for the groups.
