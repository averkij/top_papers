            "title": "1 INTRODUCTION\nEfficient neural retrieval models are based on a bi-encoder (or two\ntower) architecture, in which queries and documents are repre-\nsented separately using either high-dimensional sparse [17, 18, 75]\nor relatively low-dimensional dense vectors [19, 32, 33, 73, 76].\nThese models use simple and light-weight similarity functions,\ne.g., inner product or cosine similarity, to compute the relevance\nscore for a given pair of query and document representations. We\ndemonstrate theoretically that inner product similarity functions\nfundamentally limit the types of relevance that retrieval models can\nexpress. Specifically, we prove that there is always a set of relevant\ndocuments which cannot be perfectly retrieved regardless of the\nquery vector and specific encoder model.",

ACM ISBN 978-x-xxxx-xxxx-x/YY/MM. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn Hypencodera generic framework that learns query-dependent multi-layer neural network as similarity function that is applied to the document representations. In more detail, Hypencoder applies attention-based hypernetwork layers, called hyperhead layers, to the contextualized query embeddings output by backbone transformer encoder. Each hyperhead layer produces the weight and bias matrices for neural network layer in the query-dependent similarity network, called the q-net. The q-net is then applied to each document representation, which results in scalar relevance score. We demonstrate that the Hypencoder framework can be optimized end-to-end and can be used for efficient retrieval from large corpus. Specifically, we propose graph-based greedy search algorithm that approximates exhaustive retrieval using Hypencoder while being substantially more efficient. We conduct extensive experiments on wide range of datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of Hypencoder. We demonstrate that our implementation of Hypencoder for single vector document representations outperforms competitive single vector dense and sparse retrieval models on MS MARCO [49] and TREC Deep Learning Track data [10, 13], in addition to complex retrieval tasks, such as TREC DL-Hard [43], TREC Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) Track [3], and the instruction following dataset FollowIR [69]. Across these benchmarks Hypencoder demonstrates consistent performance gain across experiments. Note that using the proposed approximation approach, retrieval from MS MARCO [49] with approximately 8.8 million documents only takes an average of 59.6 milliseconds per query on single NVIDIA L40S GPU. main advantage of hypernetworks in machine learning is their ability to learn generalizable representations. To demonstrate that Hypencoder also inherits this generalization quality, we evaluate our model under various domain adaptation settings: (1) adaptation to question answering datasets in biomedical and financial domains, and (2) adaptation to other retrieval tasks, including entity and argument retrieval, where Hypencoder again demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines. We believe that these performance gains are just the by-product of our main contributions; Hypencoder introduces new way to think about what retrieval and relevance functions can be, it opens new world of possibilities by bridging the gap between neural networks and retrieval similarity functions. We believe Hypencoder is especially important at this time given the new demands for longer and more complex queries brought on by the widespread usage of large language models and it is our belief that Hypencoder represents an important step towards this goal. To help facilitate this goal we will open source all our code for training, retrieval, and evaluation. 1Available at https://github.com/jfkback/hypencoder-paper Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Julian Killingback, Hansi Zeng, and Hamed Zamani IP 𝐸𝑞 𝐸𝑑 pooler pooler 𝐸𝑑 pooler s"

            "content": "Vector Space Models. Vector-based models that use sparse vectors have existed for decades, with each index representing term in the corpus vocabulary. Document-query similarity is computed using measures like 𝑙2 distance, inner product, or cosine similarity, with term weighting methods such as TF-IDF being substantial focus to improve performance. With the emergence of deep neural networks, focus shifted to learning representations for queries and documents. SNRM by Zamani et al. [75] was the first deep learning model to retrieve documents from large corpora by learning latent sparse vectors. Following works leveraged pretrained transformer models like BERT [16] using single dense vector representations [32]. Recent improvements have focused on training techniques including self-negative mining [52, 53, 73, 77], data augmentation [38, 53], distillation [26, 37, 38], corpus-pretraining [19, 30, 40, 71], negative-batch construction [28] and curriculum learning [39, 76]. Alternative approaches include ColBERT [33], which uses multiple dense vectors, and SPLADE [18], which revisits sparse representations using pretrained masked language models. Though these methods vary substantially, they all share fundamental commonality, that relevance is based on an inner product (or in some cases cosine similarity). We believe that this is significant limitation of these methods and one which hampers the performance of these models on complex retrieval tasks. Our method circumvents this limitation by learning query-dependent small neural network that is fast enough to run on the entire collection (or used in an approximate way; see Section 3.6 for details). Learned Relevance Models. Light-weight relevance models using neural networks have demonstrated improved retrieval performance compared to simple methods like inner products. Early iterations came in the form of learning-to-rank models [8, 9] which use query and document features to produce relevance scores for reranking. While these models traditionally used engineered features, more recent approaches adopted richer inputs. For instance, MatchPyramid [51] and KNRM [72] use similarity matrices between non-contextualized word embeddings, while Duet [47, 48] combines sparse and dense term features in multi-layer perceptron. DRMM [74] utilized histogram features as input to neural networks for scoring. Since the advent of BERT [16], focus has shifted to making transformer models more efficient, such as PreTTR [42] which separately precomputes query and document hidden states. Recently, LITE [31] extended ColBERTs similarity using column-wise and row-wise linear layers for scoring. In the recommender systems community, learned similarity measures have been widely used [24, 25]. The common usage of neural scoring methods in recommendation has inspired research into efficient retrieval with more learned scoring signals. For instance, BFSG [62] supports efficient retrieval with arbitrary relevance functions by using graph of item representations and greedy search strategy over nodes of the graph. recent improvement on BFSG uses the scoring models gradient to prune directions that are unlikely to have relevant items [79]. Other works make use of queries to form query-item graph to produce more informative neighbors [61]. Our work differs from these works in one major way, we do not have query representation and document representation thus our method requires no combination step, instead we produce query-conditioned neural network for each query and directly apply this to the document representation. This approach can reduce the similarity networks size and does not require choosing between inference speed and larger query representations. Furthermore the flexibility of our framework means we can replicate any existing learned relevance model as discussed in Section 3.7. On broader note there has been surprisingly little work on neural based scoring for full-scale retrieval, especially in the modern era of transformer based encoders. We hope our work can be useful foundation and proof-of-concept for future work in this area. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks also known as hypernets are neural networks which produce the weights for other neural networks. The term was first used by Ha et al. [22] who demonstrated the effectiveness of hypernetworks to generate weights for LSTM networks. Since then, hypernetworks have been used in variety of ways including neural architecture search [78], continual learning Hypencoder: Hypernetworks for Information Retrieval Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA [66], and few-shot learning [57, 59] to name few. Generally, hypernetworks take set of input embeddings that provide information about the type of task or network where the weights will be used. These embeddings are then projected to the significantly larger dimension of the weights of the main network. As the outputs of most hypernetworks are so large the hypernetworks themselves are often very simple such as few feed-forward layers in order to keep computation feasible. Our case is unique in that our hypernetwork, the Hypencoder, is much larger than the small scoring network which we call q-net (i.e. the main network). Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first work to explore hypernetworks for first stage retrieval."

            "title": "3 HYPENCODER\nNeural ranking models can be generally categorized into early-\ninteraction and late-interaction models [14, 20, 27, 33, 34, 50, 68].\nCurrently, the most common implementation of early-interaction\nmodels is in the form of cross-encoders (Figure 1 (second from the\nleft)), where the query text 𝑞 and document text 𝑑 are concatenated\n(together with some predefined tokens or templates) and fed to a\ntransformer network that learns a joint representation of query\nand document and finally produces a relevance score. The joint rep-\nresentation prevents these models from being able to precompute\ndocument representations, thus they cannot be used efficiently on\nlarge corpora [21, 46].",
            "content": "The most popular implementation of late-interaction models follows bi-encoder (or two tower) network architecture (Figure 1 (left)), where query and document representations are computed separately and scoring function is used to estimate the relevance score. Formally, let 𝐸𝑞 R𝑛ℎ denote the representation learned for query 𝑞 consisting of 𝑛 ℎ-dimensional vectors. Similarly, 𝐸𝑑 R𝑚ℎ denotes the representation learned for document 𝑑 consisting of 𝑚 vectors of the same dimensionality. The relevance score between 𝑞 and 𝑑 is computed as follows: 𝜓 (𝐸𝑞, 𝐸𝑑 ) (1) where 𝜓 : R𝑛ℎ R𝑚ℎ denotes the scoring function. In order to take advantage of efficient indexing techniques, such as an inverted index in the case of sparse representations [18, 75] or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in the case of dense representations [32], many existing works use pooling techniques to obtain single vector representation for each query and document and then employs simple and light-weight scoring functions, such as inner product or cosine similarity. There also exist more expensive methods that do not use pooling and perform such light-weight scoring functions at the vector level and then aggregate them, such as the maximum inner product similarity used in ColBERT [33]. On the Limitations of Linear Similarity Functions (e.g., Inner Product). We believe the simple similarity functions used by existing bi-encoder models are not sufficient for modeling complex relationships between queries and documents. These functions inherently limit retrieval models to judge relevance in way that can be represented by an inner product. Furthermore, it has been shown that the ability to compress and reconstruct information is correlated with the size, and thus complexity, of neural models [15]. This result indicates that using relevance function as simple as an inner product likely reduces the amount of information that can be stored in fixed representation size. These factors explain why state-of-the-art dense retrieval models continue to underperform cross-encoder models, in terms of retrieval quality [36]. In the following, we show the limitations of inner products (as linear similarity function) by theoretically demonstrating the impossibility of inner products to produce perfect rankings for some queries, regardless of the method used to create the query and document embeddings. Let 𝐶 denote corpus of 𝑁 documents, each being represented by an ℎ-dimensional vector. perfect ranking of documents in 𝐶 for provided query is ranking where all relevant documents are ranked above all non-relevant documents. According to Radons Theorem [54], any set of ℎ + 1 document vectors with ℎ dimensions can be partitioned into two sets whose convex hulls intersect. An important application of Radons Theorem is in calculating the VapnikChervonenkis (VC) dimension [64] of ℎ-dimensional vectors with respect to linear separability. For any ℎ + 2 vectors, the two subsets of Radon partition cannot be linearly separated. In other words, for 𝑁 > ℎ + 1, there exists at least one group of documents that is not linearly separable from the rest. In the real world, since 𝑁 ℎ + 1, there are indeed many such non-separable subsets. If any two of these subsets contain all the relevant documents for query, then no linear similarity function can perfectly separate relevant from irrelevant documents. This includes inner product similarity and guarantees that, for some query, there will be an imperfect ranking. To overcome these limitations with inner product similarity we use multi-layer neural network with query-conditioned weights as our similarity measure. As neural networks are universal approximators [29], Hypencoders similarity function can express far more complex functions than those expressed by inner products. related alternative approach with the same benefits takes the query and document representations, combines them (e.g., through concatenation or similarity matrices), and feeds them to neural network to serve as similarity function (Figure 1 (second from the right)). However, this approach suffers from the following shortcomings: (1) query and document representations now need to be combined before scoring adding latency proportional to the complexity of the method used to combine them; (2) having separate query and document representations increases the input dimension to the neural network further increasing latency; (3) for efficiency reasons, the query representation is often pooled or compressed before being input into network which reduces the information the model receives. Hypencoder addresses these shortcomings. Since the query is directly encoded as the neural networks weights no concatenation or other form of combining inputs is needed, the document representation can be directly input to the scoring network. This, in addition to the reduced network size from having only document representations as input, allows for substantial latency improvement. Further, as Hypencoder produces query-specific neural network, every weight can be used to store query-related information without any need for compression or additional overhead. Lastly, we show in Section 3.7 that existing learned relevance methods can be exactly replicated by Hypencoder with the additional flexibility of learning query-specific weights when desirable.

            "content": "Now comes our unique contribution that allows our method to consider more complex similarity signals. Given the query 𝑞, the query encoder Φ first produces set of contextualized embeddings in similar way to existing encoder models which we will call 𝐸𝑞 R𝑛ℎ, where 𝑛 is the number of embeddings and ℎ is the dimension of the embeddings. At this point while existing methods apply simple pooling mechanism, our query encoder instead uses hyper-head. The hyper-head takes 𝐸𝑞 and produces set of matrices and vectors that are then used as the weights and biases for small neural network which we coin the q-net. The q-net is query-dependent function for estimating relevance scores for each document, meaning each q-net is unique to the query that created it, unlike existing neural scoring methods which use shared set of weights for all queries. To find the relevance of document, the document representation 𝐸𝑑 is passed as input to the q-net which outputs the relevance score. Hypencoder is generic framework which allows direct application of existing paradigms from neural retrieval and, more broadly, machine learning. For example, Hypencoder could easily work with multiple vectors similar to existing multi-vector models, e.g., [33], or use training routines popularized in dense retrieval, e.g., [38, 52, 73, 76]. As an initial exploration, this paper focuses on showing the efficacy of Hypencoder without additional complexity and thus uses single vector document representation and no complex training recipes."

The contextualized query embeddings 𝐸𝑞 R𝑛ℎ produced by the query encoder are independently transformed by 𝑙 hyperhead layers, each of which corresponds to layer in the q-net. Each hyperhead layer converts the embeddings 𝐸𝑞 into key and value matrices: 𝐾𝑞 𝑖 = 𝜃𝐾𝑖 [𝐸𝑞; 1] 𝑉 𝑞 𝑖 = 𝜃𝑉𝑖 [𝐸𝑞; 1] (2) where 𝜃𝐾𝑖 , 𝜃𝑉𝑖 Rℎℎ denote learnable parameters for constructing key and value matrices. In the above equation, the embedding matrix 𝐸𝑞 is concatenated with column of all ones (i.e., [𝐸𝑞; 1]) to model both weight multiplication and bias addition. Each key matrix 𝐾𝑖 and value matrix 𝑉𝑖 will be used for the creation of the weights in the 𝑖th layer of the q-net. With the keys and values in hand, single-head scaled-dot-product attention [65] is performed using query matrix 𝑄𝑖 R𝑟 ℎ where 𝑟 is the layer dimensionality in the 𝑖th layer of q-net. In our case, all of the weights except the last layer are square matrices, making 𝑟 = ℎ. Each 𝑄𝑖 is set of learnable embeddings, similar to those used as input tokens for transformer models.

After constructing the document graph, approximate search is performed following Algorithm 1.

We also consider an option without the final termination condition which we call without early stopping.

We will now demonstrate that Hypencoder can exactly replicate any neural retrieval method that has the components above. The first step is to include 𝐸𝑞 and 𝑓𝑐 (, ) in the q-net. This allows the q-net to exactly produce the input to 𝑓𝑠 () that the existing neural retriever used. Next we reproduce the neural function from 𝑓𝑠 () with query-dependent weights in the q-net. When 𝐸𝑑 is input to the q-net, all the original components of the existing neural retrieval model are present and thus the score can be exactly replicated. There is one difference, which is the weights of 𝑓𝑠 () are querydependent. However, this can be remedied in two ways: (1) shared weights can be used for all queries exactly replicating the original neural method (2) the weights for 𝑓𝑐 can have common non-querydependent base weight, similar to our implementation (see details in Section 3.3), this way if there is no benefit using query-dependent weights the shared weight can be used, but if there is additional benefit the model and optimizer can learn to take advantage of it. Thus, Hypencoder can not only exactly replicate all existing neural retrieval methods it also allows the model to dynamically leverage query-dependent weights when the model determines they are beneficial."

            "title": "4 EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Datasets\n4.1.1 Training Dataset. The dataset used for training our models\nis the training split of the MSMARCO passage retrieval dataset [49]\nwhich contains 8.8M passages and has 503K training queries with\nat least one corresponding relevant passage. The queries in the\nMSMARCO training set are short natural language questions asked\nby users of the Bing search engine.",
            "content": "To create the training pairs, we first retrieved 800 passages for every query using an early iteration of Hypencoder. From these, we sampled 200 passages the top 100 passages and another 100 randomly sampled from the remaining 700 passages. These querypassage pairs were then labeled using the MiniLM cross-encoder2 from the Sentence Transformers Library [55]. 4.1.2 Validation Dataset. For validating and parameter tuning, we use the TREC Deep Learning (DL) 2021 [11] and 2022 passage task [11, 12]. As the passage collection for TREC DL 21 and 22 is large and we wanted validation to be fast we created subset with only passages in the QREL files. 4.1.3 Evaluation Datasets. Our evaluation explores retrieval performance in three different areas: in-domain performance, out-ofdomain performance, and performance on hard retrieval tasks. For in-domain performance, we use the MSMARCO Dev set [49], TREC Deep Learning 2019 [13], and TREC Deep Learning 2020 [10]. The MSMARCO Dev set contains around 7k queries with shallow labels, the majority of queries only have single passage labeled as relevant. This collection uses queries from the same distribution as the training queries making it clear test of the in-domain performance. On this dataset we report the standard evaluation metrics: MRR and Recall@1000. The TREC Deep Learning 2019 and 2020 datasets have similar query distribution to MSMARCO Dev but feature far fewer queries, i.e., 97 queries combined. The lower number of queries is compensated by far deeper annotations with every query having several annotated passages. To assess out-of-domain performance, we evaluate on question answering tasks on different domains, specifically, the TREC COVID [56] and NFCorpus datasets [7] for the biomedical domain and FiQA [44] for the financial domain. We also evaluate on DBPedia [23] as an entity retrieval dataset and on Touché [6] as an argument retrieval dataset. We use the BEIR [63] versions of these datasets from the ir_datasets library. To explore the full capabilities of Hypencoder we want to evaluate how it performs on retrieval tasks that are more challenging than standard question-passage retrieval tasks. To some extent hardness is subjective, but we tried to define clear set of criteria to define difficulty: (1) current neural retrieval models should struggle on the task, (2) term matching models like BM25 should also struggle on the task, (3) the queries are longer or otherwise more complicated than standard web queries. An additional requirement we had was that for tasks that were significantly different from the MSMARCO training data we wanted adequate training data to finetune the models before evaluation. We believe this is reasonable as we are not investigating the models zero-shot performance but the inherent limits of the model. The first dataset we select was the TREC Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) 2023 [3] that contains queries written by users that know many aspects of the item they are looking for but not the name of the item. Thus TOT queries tend to be verbose and can include many facets. The TREC TOT 2023 dataset specifically looks at TOT queries for movies with the corresponding movies Wikipedia page as the golden passage. We use the development set as the test set relevance labels are not public yet. There are 150 queries. Each query has single relevant passage. For training we use the data from Bhargav et al. [5] which is around 15k TOT queries from Reddit for the book and movie domain. The second dataset is FollowIR [69] for instruction following in retrieval. This dataset is built on top of three existing TREC datasets: TREC Robust 04 [67], TREC News 21 [60], and TREC Core 17 [2]; it uses the fact that these datasets include instructions to the annotators which can act as complex instruction. To test how well retrieval system follows the instruction the creators of FollowIR modify the instruction to be more specific and re-annotate the known relevant documents. As training data we use MSMARCO with Instructions, recent modification of MSMARCO which adds instructions to the queries as well as new positive passages and hard negative passages which consider the instruction [70]. The final dataset is subset of TREC DL-HARD [43]. The full dataset uses some of the queries from TREC DL 2019 and 2020 as well as some queries that were considered for DL 2019 and 2020 but were not included in the final query collection. TREC DL-HARD is built specifically with the hardest queries from the TREC DL pool. The authors do so by using commercial search engine to find queries that are not easily answered. The standard TREC DLHARD dataset has 50 queries half of which appear in TREC DL 2Available at https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2. 3Available at https://ir-datasets.com/.

            "content": "We use training batch size of 64 per device and 128 in total. single example in the batch is query, positive document, and 8 additional documents ranging in relevance. The positive document is the top ranked document by our teacher model. The other 8 documents are sampled randomly from the passages associated with the query. For more details about the dataset see Section 4.1.1. Passages were truncated to 196 tokens and queries to 32 tokens. Our primary loss function is Margin MSE [26]. When computing the loss, we construct (query, positive document, negative document) triplets where all of the negatives for query form their own triplet. The loss is found by averaging the individual loss of all the triplets. In addition to Margin MSE, we use an in-batch cross entropy loss where the (query, positive document) is assumed to be true positive and all the other queries positive documents are assumed to be negatives. We do not consider the additional hard negatives from the query in the cross entropy loss as many of these documents are relevant to the query. We use AdamW as our optimizer with default settings and learning rate of 2e-5 with constant scheduler after warm up of 6k steps. Our training hardware consist of two A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. Training took around 6 days. To select the best model we evaluate each model on the validation set every 50k steps and pick the model with the best Precision within the first 800k steps. We selected Precision due to the fact that it balances both recall and precision in single metric and does not require predefined cutoff. When training for the harder tasks we use AdamW with the learning rate 8e-6 with linear scheduler and warm-up ratio of 1e-1. For TOT training we train for 25 epochs or 3.3k steps. For FollowIR training we train for 1 epoch or around 10k steps. We use batch-size of 96 and cross entropy loss. Each example in the batch includes query, positive document, and hard negative document. We use maximum document and query length of 512 tokens."

In other words, DRAGON is likely close to if not the ceiling for BERT-based bi-encoders and still Hypencoder is able to match it with simple distillation training setup and far less training compute. Hypencoder also beats both rerankers MonoBERT and crossSimLM; demonstrating that reranking cannot make up for weak retrievers performance. Continuing in TREC-DL 19 and 20 we find that Hypencoder even surpassed RepLLaMA which is more than 60x larger and which also uses significantly larger document embedding dimension of 4096. In fact the only model beating Hypencoder in nDCG@10 is ColBERTv2 which uses an embedding for every token in the document compared to Hypencoders fixed 768 dimension token. MSMARCO Dev results are also good with Hypencoder outperforming all the baselines and outperforming few of the reference models such as SPLADE++ and MonoBERT. Overall Hypencoders in-domain results are exceptionally strong given the simple training routine used, small encoder model size, and document representation size. To the best of our knowledge, Hypencoder sets new record for combined TREC-DL 19 and 20 nDCG@10 with 768 dimension dense document vector. 4.4.2 Out-of-Domain Results. Table 2 shows our results on the select out-of-domain datasets, we only include our main baseline models and BM25 due to space limitations. The general trend is that Hypencoder has strong out-of-domain performance in question answering tasks (Q&A) and entity retrieval tasks. This indicates that despite Hypencoders more complex similarity function it is still able to generalize well in zero-shot manner to new tasks. 4.4.3 Results on Harder Retrieval Tasks. The results on the harder retrieval tasks are in Table 3, like in the out-of-domain section we only consider the main baseline models and BM25. We can see that in the harder tasks Hypencoder remains dominant over Baselines Ours Rep type sparse dense dense dense hypernet BM TAS-B CL-DRD BE-Base Hypecoder & TREC-Covid FiQA NFCorpus Misc.

Additionally, the relative improvement compared to the in-domain results are higher (on all metrics that Hypencoder is the best for) suggesting that on harder tasks the added complexity that can be captured by Hypencoders similarity function is especially important. Additionally the high performance on TREC tip-of-thetongue (TOT) and FollowIR indicate that Hypencoder adapts well to different domains through domain-specific fine-tuning. On the evaluated subset of TREC DL-HARD we see that Hypencoder has stronger precision metrics than the baselines by large margin. As mentioned previously the higher relative improvement suggests that Hypencoder is especially dominant on harder tasks which, in part, explains its higher performance on TREC DL 19 and 20. Though on in-domain dataset Hypencoder does better or the same on recall metrics, on TREC DL-HARD BE-Base has higher recall than Hypencoder. We suspect that this may be because the relevance function that the q-net applies is not smooth, which has the benefit of being more discerning and likely accounts for some of the precision gains. However, if the q-net makes mistake the non-smooth scoring could result in much harsher score than the linear inner product is capable of producing. Moving to TREC tip-of-my-tongue (TOT) we see that Hypencoder continues to perform well. Tip-of-the-tongue is complex retrieval task with long queries and passages and multiple aspects, the fact Hypencoder outperforms the baselines by large margin validates the need for more complex relevance function. Finally we have FollowIR which has three subsets on all three Hypencoder has the best performance on the retrieval evaluation metrics of choice, in many cases by sizable amount. Beside the retrieval evaluation metrics we also include p-MRR which is metric released in the FollowIR [69] paper. The metric measures the change in document ranks before and after an instruction is modified to see how well the model responses to the additional requirements. p-MRR of 0 indicates no change in document rank based on the instruction change and p-MRR of +100 indicates the documents were perfectly changed based on the instruction while -100 indicates the opposite. For additional details we refer readers to the original FollowIR paper [69]. As p-MRR is relative to each models performance before the instructions are modified it is not indicative of stand-alone retrieval performance. With that said, Hypencoder is the only model to achieve positive p-MRR Hypencoder: Hypernetworks for Information Retrieval Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Table 3: Evaluation metrics for the harder set of tasks which include TREC DL-HARD, TREC Tip-of-my-tongue TOT, and FollowIR.

This is no small feat as in the original FollowIR paper no retrieval model of the size of Hypencoder was able to get positive p-MRR and even many much larger models trained on large instruction retrieval datasets could not get positive result. 4.4.4 Analysis of Efficiency. To be able to search large-scale collections Hypencoder has to work well while only doing computation on small subset of the document corpus. This led us to develop the efficient algorithm in Section 3.6. To quantify the performance we do set of experiments varying the key parameters to see how each impacts both search quality and query latency. The results of these experiments can be seen in Figure 2. Note the document-todocument graph used has 100 neighbors per document. The figures show that each parameter has an important role in search quality. The largest role is played by 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼𝑡𝑒𝑟 which can drastically reduce search performance if not set high enough, but which plateaus after around 12. The value of 𝑛𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 follows similar pattern with drastic increase followed by plateau. The parameter 𝐶, the number of initial candidates, is unique in that it has more gradual rise and is the only parameter that causes decrease in effectiveness if raised too high. We suspect this happens because only 𝑛𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 are explored at each iteration but all candidates in 𝐶 are considered visited and thus are not explored in the future. This could mean that many good results from the initial candidates are not explored, leaving potentially good neighbors of these nodes undiscovered. Another interesting aspect of 𝐶 is that time decreases as it increases when early stopping is used. This is likely because high quality candidates are found sooner allowing search to end more quickly. In general, our approximation seems to behave as expected in terms of both time and retrieval performance. With the insights from our analysis above we developed two configurations, one which optimizes for speed and one that optimizes for retrieval quality. These two configurations compared against exhaustive search can be seen in Table 4. Both approximate configurations significantly decrease the retrieval time when compared to the exhaustive approach. Impact of q-net Depth. Hypencoder performance suggests 4.4.5 that having more complex relevance function does indeed help improve retrieval performance as we had hypothesized. This raises the question: what is the optimal complexity of this relevance function. To answer this question we trained four versions of Hypencoder each trained to produce q-net with different number of layers. We selected [2, 4, 6, 8] as the number of q-net layers. The results can be seen in Figure 3. The experiment shows that there is benefit beyond two layers and that at least four is required Table 4: Average query latency and nDCG@10 on TREC DL 19 and 20 with efficient search. Efficient 1 uses parameters ( 𝐶 = 10000, 𝑛𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 = 64, 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 16), Efficient 2 uses parameters ( 𝐶 = 100000, 𝑛𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 = 328, 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐼𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 20).

Performance stays the same with six, indicating that this might be the point of diminishing returns. Lastly, eight layers decrease performance. There could be number of reasons for this including that eight layers are harder to optimize or because effectively learning how to use all eight layers takes longer and thus might achieve better performance with extended training time."
