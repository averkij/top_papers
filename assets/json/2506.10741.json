Existing generative approaches primarily focus on\nfoundational tasks such as text rendering [3, 4, 18, 31] or the cre-\nation of specific product-oriented posters [8, 22, 34], offering limited\ncapacity to produce high-quality, aesthetically compelling outputs.\nThese methods often fall short of addressing the multifaceted de-\nmands of aesthetic poster design, which requires not only (i) ac-\ncurate and stylistically coherent text, but also (ii) the creation of\nabstract and visually appealing artistic content and (iii) the striking\nlayouts and holistic stylistic consistency.

            "content": "Recent approaches to aesthetic poster generation [2, 25, 28, 40] have primarily followed modular design paradigm. Typically, fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) acts as layout planner, suggesting text content and positioning. The suggestions are then overlaid onto separately generated background, or used as hard constraints for the generative model to follow. However, this design strategy presents several limitations. (i.) Lack of aesthetic Sixiang Chen1,2,, Jianyu Lai1,, Jialin Gao2,, Tian Ye1, Haoyu Chen1, Hengyu Shi2, Shitong Shao1, Yunlong Lin3, Song Fei1, Zhaohu Xing1, Yeying Jin4, Junfeng Luo2, 2 Xiaoming Wei2, Lei Zhu1,5, consistency: it undermines the visual and stylistic coherence essential for aesthetic poster creation. (ii.) Limited visual quality: it constrains the upper bound of visual quality due to the decoupled design process and heavy reliance on the VLMs accuracy and robustness. In contrast, existing end-to-end design-centered generation approaches [3, 8, 11, 34] remain limited to relatively simple tasks, such as greeting cards or product compositions, which lack the visual and structural complexity of high-quality aesthetic posters. Additionally, while powerful foundation models [1, 6, 9] have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating complex natural images, they still fall short of meeting all the specific requirements of aesthetic posters. (e.g. precise text rendering, abstract artistic content, and holistic stylistic coherence). For this, we classify it as (iii.) Simplified use cases. More importantly, the absence of large-scale, versatile datasets tailored specifically for aesthetic poster generation has further constrained the development of fully generative solutions(iv.) Absence of targeted datasets. To move beyond the limitations of current modular and simply scoped generative paradigms, we leverage the capabilities of foundation models to explore unified generation for aesthetic posters, aiming to produce visually coherent and artistically compelling results. In this work, we argue that incremental, component-level improvements alone are insufficient to achieve significant aesthetic gains. Instead, we propose unified framework, PosterCraft, which includes comprehensive workflow to systematically perform four critical stages: (i.) scalable text rendering optimization, (ii.) highquality poster fine-tuning, (iii.) aesthetic-text reinforcement learning, and (iv.) vision-language feedback refinement. To support this workflow, we construct suite of specialized datasets for each stage through automated pipelines, enabling robust training and facilitating future research in aesthetic poster generation. This framework empowers the trained model to generate high-quality posters in the end-to-end pass. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results compared to several closed-source models. Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows: unified framework for aesthetic poster generation: We revisit aesthetic poster generation through an end-toend approach tailored for high-quality, visually coherent posters, surpassing prior modular pipelines and methods focused on simpler or product-centric designs. cascade workflow for high-quality poster optimization: We propose unified training pipeline with four stages: (i) scalable text rendering optimization, (ii) high-quality poster fine-tuning, (iii) aesthetic-text reinforcement learning, and (iv) vision-language feedback refinement. Each stage targets key challenge in aesthetic poster generation, enabling the model to produce artistically compelling results at inference time. Stage-specific, fully automated dataset construction: We construct specialized datasets for each workflow stage using automated collection and filtering, tailored to the unique demands of aesthetic poster generation. These datasets overcome the limitations of resources and support more robust, transferable training. Superior performance over existing baselines: Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms open-source baselines in terms of both aesthetic quality and layout structure, and achieves competitive performance compared to commercial systems."

To overcome these issues, we construct Text-Render2M via an automated pipeline, producing 2 million samples with diverse text (varying in content, size, count, placement, and rotation) rendered crisply onto high-quality backgrounds. Each text instance is paired with precise captions merged seamlessly with existing image captions.

Here we only consider two-choice questions, that is, the case where there are only 𝐴 and 𝐵 in 𝐿; the weight 𝑤𝐴 is set to 0 and 𝑤𝐵 is set to 1. In our filtering pipeline, we utilize InternVL2.58B-MPO [12] for logits computation with threshold of 0.98, allowing precise control over filtering stringency. We further refine the dataset using perceptual hashing to remove visually similar posters. The remaining posters are captioned using Gemini2.5-Flash and subjected to HPS scoring, with posters scoring below 0.25 being filtered out to ensure aesthetic quality alignment with human preferences. To support Region-aware Calibration, HQ-Poster-100K also provides precise text region masks for each poster. Due to the limitations of traditional OCR in recognizing artistic typography, we use Gemini2.5-Flash to extract text region coordinates. Based on their proportional size relative to the poster, masks are classified as Major or Minor, denoting large and small text areas respectively, as shown in Figure2. More details can be found in our supplementary material. Region-aware Calibration. In poster design, harmony between text and background is crucial. Since our first stage has already improved the text rendering capability of the model, this fine-tuning PosterCraft: Rethinking High-Quality Aesthetic Poster Generation in Unified Framework 5 Fig. 4. The pipeline of PosterCraft, which has four stages: (1) Text Rendering Optimization to improve text accuracy and fidelity; (2) High-Quality Poster Fine-Tuning with region-aware calibration to poster styling across text and non-text regions; (3) Aesthetic-Text Reinforcement Learning to instill detailed aesthetic and content preferences; and (4) Joint VisionLanguage Feedback, integrating multimodal reflections for refined outputs. At inference, the fine-tuned model generates high-quality aesthetic posters end-to-end from single prompt, with an optional VLM-driven critique loop. phase shifts the focus to overall poster style. Therefore, we propose Region-aware Calibration to achieve this purpose. Specifically, essential text carries the core message and is assigned moderate weight to ensure clarity and integration with the background; by contrast, small textoccupying minimal space and prone to rendering errorsis downweighted to prevent distracting collapse. Nontext regions, which define the visual style of the poster, receive full emphasis to guarantee smooth transition from high-quality imagery to unified aesthetic layout. This balanced weighting strategy allows the fine-tuned model to preserve text accuracy while strengthening the artistic integrity of the aesthetic poster. We implement this via per-pixel weight map 𝑤 (𝑝): 𝑤 (𝑝) = if 𝑝 LargeTextMask, if 𝑝 SmallTextMask, 0.6 0.2 1.0 otherwise, (3) and define our weighted loss as: (cid:0)𝑣𝜙 (𝑥𝑡 , 𝑡) (cid:164)𝑥𝑡 (cid:1) 𝑤 poster flow = E𝑡 (0,1), 𝑥0, 𝜀 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) where \"\" denotes point-wise multiplication by the weight map 𝑤.

Using HPSv2 [36], we evaluate 5 generated posters per group for human preference scoring, selecting the highest-scoring poster as the preferred sample and the lowest-scoring one as the rejected sample to form preference pairs. Since HPSv2 only evaluates image content and aesthetics, we employ Gemini2.5-Flash to verify text rendering accuracy and style consistency with captions in the preferred posters, filtering out inconsistent pairs. This process yields 6K preference pairs meeting two criteria: 1) an HPSv2 score difference exceeding 0.025, and 2) complete text accuracy in preferred posters. AestheticText Preference Optimization. While the preceding stages guarantee pixel-level text fidelity and precisely calibrated poster styles, they fail to capture the higher-order trade-offs that render poster genuinely compelling. In particular, (i) detailed preferences, such as subtle layout balance, color harmony, and typographic cohesion, which require global evaluation beyond per-pixel accuracy; (ii) even after achieving crisp text rendering, further corrective tuning is necessary to alleviate residual errors and seamlessly integrate text with the holistic aesthetic. To address these gaps, we frame poster generation as reinforcement learning problem in this stage: the model must not only denoise accurately but also preferentially generate outputs that satisfy holistic aesthetic criteria. Concretely, for each prompt, we sample 𝑛 poster variants {𝑥 (𝑖 ) }𝑛 𝑖=1 under the current diffusion policy and collapse them into single winning and losing pair via best-of-𝑛 selection under the combined aesthetictext reward 𝑅(𝑥): 𝑥 + = arg max 𝑖 𝑅 (cid:0)𝑥 (𝑖 ) (cid:1), 𝑥 = arg min 𝑖 𝑅 (cid:0)𝑥 (𝑖 ) (cid:1).

Because the marginal 𝑝𝜃 (𝑥0 𝑐) is intractable, we employ the ELBO over the full diffusion chain to evaluate these log-ratio rewards, following prior work [33, 34]. In this way, best-of-𝑛 AestheticText Preference Optimization directly injects unified preference signal into the diffusion training process."

To optimize our prompting strategy for both feedback and VLM fine-tuning, we implement specific guidelines: the model is instructed to perform internal comparisons without explicitly referencing the second reference poster, and feedback is structured as concrete editing instructions. Reflect VLM fine-tuning. To obtain optimization feedback during inference, we construct VQA samples by embedding the original caption in the prompt alongside the generated poster requiring optimization, and using Gemini2.5-Flash-generated feedback as supervision. Specifically, this input configuration maintains consistency between training and inference phases, excluding reference target posters in both cases and using the original prompt as the baseline for suggestions. Additionally, when generating feedback with Gemini2.5-Flash, we deliberately utilize only target posters as references, omitting original captions to preserve model creativity. Joint VisionLanguage Conditioning. For the poster construction, iterative critiquecombining visual inspection with targeted verbal feedbackis essential for refining both aesthetic content and background harmony. Inspired by this, we introduce joint visionlanguage feedback loop for multimodal corrections in unified workflow. For each generatedground-truth pair, Gemini produces two textual reflections, 𝑓𝑐 (Poster Content Suggestions) and 𝑓𝑠 (Aesthetic Style Suggestions). Rather than appending these strings to the original promptwhich would exceed the encoders length and degrade performancewe jointly encode them via text encoder 𝐸𝑡 , yielding 𝑒𝑐,𝑠 = 𝐸𝑡 (𝑓𝑐, 𝑓𝑠 ), and then concatenate this with the original prompt embedding 𝑒𝑝 (with positional encodings to preserve order Fig. 5.

Additionally, drawing on OmniControl [27], we inject the image-level feedback signal 𝑣img (encoded by VAE) directly into the conditioning branch. The resulting multimodal context is: 𝑐 = [ 𝑒𝑝 ; 𝑒𝑐,𝑠 ; 𝑣img ] (7) where 𝑐 serves as the conditioning input.

However, both demonstrate prompt adherence issues: Ideogram-v2 fails to accurately depict mountain formations, Gemini lacks photorealism, and neither successfully generates silhouette effects in the third image. In the short-prompt setting of Fig.9, PosterCraft maintains strong balance between visual appeal and accurate text rendering. It consistently integrates title and scene elements, for example, seamlessly embedding PixelPlay Retro Game Console or International Animation Festival in stylized compositions. Competing models often display legibility issues (e.g., SD3.5, Flux1.dev), omit key poster elements (e.g., BAGEL, Ideogram-v2), or suffer from text-scene disconnection (e.g., Playground-v2.5). While Gemini2.0-Flash-Gen performs well in text rendering, it still suffers from aesthetic limitations, often producing visually monotonous outputs with missing or underdeveloped design elements. Our results stand out with their vibrant layout, theme adherence, and natural visual-text coherence, even under minimal input conditions."

            "content": "majority of the samples are generated using templatebased grammars, with phrases constructed from predefined structures filled with curated vocabulary lists. smaller portion uses random alphanumeric strings to simulate noisy or unstructured textual inputs. The generator supports rich variations in punctuation, casing , and structure (e.g., both single-word and short-phrase constructions), ensuring linguistic diversity. Font Selection and Style Variability Fonts are randomly drawn from categorized library containing both standard and artistic typefaces. When multiple styles are available, roughly even split is enforced between classic and stylized fonts. The system filters fonts that do not support lowercase letters to avoid invalid renderings. This selection mechanism ensures visual variability while maintaining text legibility. Layout and Placement Strategy Text is positioned using 33 gridbased partitioning scheme (e.g., top-left, center, bottom-right). Before final placement, bounding box collision checks are performed. If an overlap is detected, the system will retry placement with different positions or reduced font sizes, often within 35 attempts per instance. This strategy enables dense yet legible arrangements while minimizing visual clutter. Orientation and Alignment Orientation options include: Horizontal, Vertically rotated (rotated 90 degrees), Vertically stacked (one character per line). In the horizontal mode, small proportion of texts receive random rotation, and subset of longer text fragments are automatically wrapped across multiple lines. Alignment is randomly selected among left, center, or right justification. Prompt Generation Each image is paired with structured natural language prompt. Prompts include: The text content, Position (e.g., bottom right), Orientation (e.g., vertically stacked), Color category, and Optionally (included in 50% of cases), the font style. When multiple texts are rendered, their prompts are numbered and concatenated. If no text is successfully rendered, fallback prompt indicating the absence of text is generated.

You will be given an image and an original text prompt that was intended to generate an image similar to the one provided. Your task is to assess whether the image is substantially consistent with the original text prompt based on the criteria below. Original Text Prompt: \"{original_prompt_text}\" Evaluation Criteria (Prioritized): (1) Text Accuracy: Thoroughly analyze all text visible in the image. Check for any inaccuracies such as typos, missing characters/words, or extra characters/words when compared to the \"Original Text Prompt\". This is the MOST CRITICAL factor. If ANY such error is found, the decision MUST be \"0\". (2) Text Style and Positioning: If text is present, does its style (font, color, decoration) and positioning (layout, orientation) in the image reasonably align with what is described or implied in the \"Original Text Prompt\"? (3) Overall Content, Artistic Style, and Visual Appeal: Does the overall image content (subjects, scene, objects) and artistic style align well with the \"Original Text Prompt\"? Is the image generally clear, well-composed, and visually appealing in the context of the prompt? Output Format: Based on your assessment, output ONLY JSON object in the following format: {{\"final_decision\": \"1\"}} if the image is substantially consistent with the original prompt across the prioritized criteria (especially if no text errors are found when text is intended) and should be kept. {{\"final_decision\": \"0\"}} if there are ANY discrepancies in Text Accuracy (typos, missing/extra characters/words), or significant issues in other critical criteria, or overall poor alignment, meaning the image should be discarded. Strict constraints: Only output the JSON object. Do NOT include any additional text, explanation, or markdown. Use exactly \"0\" or \"1\" as the value for \"final_decision\". Fig. 17.

PosterCraft: Rethinking High-Quality Aesthetic Poster Generation in Unified Framework 17 Prompt 10.1 (Best-of-6 Selection) You are professional Poster Designer. Your task is to evaluate six generated posters based on design brief (\"Original Prompt\") and select the single best poster, or indicate if none are suitable. Evaluation Process: (1) Textual Accuracy (Paramount Importance): First, assess all posters for textual accuracy against the \"Original Prompt\". Text (if any is specified or implied by the brief) MUST be perfectly accurate: No typographical errors. No missing or extra characters/words. poster with any textual flaw cannot be chosen as the best IF an alternative poster with perfect text exists. (2) Content Alignment and Aesthetic Value: This criterion is used to select among posters that have passed the textual accuracy check. The chosen poster should: Provide content as close as possible to the \"Original Prompt\". Demonstrate the highest possible aesthetic value (considering composition, color palette, typography, imagery, and overall visual impact). Selection Logic: Ideal Case: If one or more posters have perfect textual accuracy, select from THIS group the single poster that best meets Criterion 2 (Content Alignment and Aesthetic Value). Special Case (All Posters Have Textual Flaws): If ALL six posters have some textual inaccuracies, then no poster meets the primary standard for \"best.\" In this situation, you MUST output \"none\". Fallback Case (This should ideally not be reached if \"Special Case\" is handled correctly): If the logic leads here unexpectedly after \"Special Case\" consideration, and no poster has perfect text, but selection is still forced, choose the poster that, despite its textual flaws, is superior when evaluated SOLELY on Criterion 2 (Content Alignment and Aesthetic Value across all six flawed images). However, prioritize outputting \"none\" if all have text flaws. Original Prompt (Design Brief): \"`original_prompt`\" Select the image (\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", or \"none\") that best meets these requirements. Respond ONLY with JSON object in ONE of these exact formats: {{\"best_image\": \"1\"}} OR {{\"best_image\": \"none\"}} Strict constraints: Only output the JSON object. Do NOT include any additional text or markdown. Use exactly \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", or \"none\" to refer to your selection. Fig. 19.

Based on this internal comparison, provide detailed and specific suggestions in two aspects: 1. Poster Content Suggestions 2. Aesthetic Style Optimization Suggestions. Act as professional poster designer. Deliver highly detailed, specific, and actionable feedback in the form of standardized image editing instructions. MANDATORY GUIDELINES: The second poster must be fully followed as the standard. Identify and correct all visual layout and style discrepancies based on this reference. Focus exclusively on content and visual/aesthetic design. Completely ignore any issues related to text, typography, wording, spelling, rendering, or text styling. STRICT CONSTRAINTS: NEVER mention the second poster, reference, or target. NEVER use comparative phrases such as \"similar to the second poster\" or \"make it like the second poster\". ONLY describe the editing instructions for Poster 1, framed as standalone improvement tasks. RESPONSE FORMAT: Response should be formatted as clearly structured json schema: {`Poster Content Suggestions`: str, `Aesthetic style optimization suggestions`: str} Return ONLY the JSON object itself, without any introductory text or markdown formatting.

PosterCraft: Rethinking High-Quality Aesthetic Poster Generation in Unified Framework 19 Prompt 11.1 (OCR Evaluation) You are an OCR evaluation assistant. Follow these steps exactly on the attached image: (1) Ground-Truth Extraction (from the design prompt only): Do NOT read text from the image for GT. Parse ONLY the following design prompt and extract ALL text strings that should appear on the poster (titles, subtitles, dates, slogans, venue, etc.), preserving spaces and punctuation exactly: `original_prompt_text` Order them in spatial sequence (topbottom, leftright) and concatenate into raw GT text. (2) OCR Extraction (from the attached image): Run OCR on the provided image and extract ALL rendered text exactly as it appears. Preserve visual reading order (top-leftbottom-right). This is your raw OCR text. (3) Text Normalization (apply to BOTH raw GT and raw OCR before comparison): Convert all letters to lowercase. Remove ALL punctuation characters: .,;:!?\"-()[]{}...` Collapse any sequence of whitespace/newlines into single space. Trim leading and trailing spaces. (4) Character-Level Alignment & Error Counting: Align the normalized GT text and OCR text character by character. Count four categories: Insertion (I): extra character in OCR not in GT (\"more\"). Deletion (D): GT character missing in OCR (\"less\"). Substitution (S): OCR character differs from GT character (\"render error\"). Correct match (C): identical characters. (5) Metrics Calculation: Let = total normalized GT characters = + + S. Let = total normalized OCR characters = + + S. Let = total compared characters = + + + S. Character Accuracy = / T. Text Precision = / (C + + S). Text Recall = / (C + + S). Text F-score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall). (6) Final JSON Output (strictly this format, no extra keys or commentary): { \"GT_text\": \"<normalized GT text>\", \"insertions\": I, \"total_GT_chars\": N, \"OCR_text\": \"<normalized OCR text>\", \"deletions\": D, \"substitutions\": S, \"accuracy\": \"XX.XX%\", \"precision\": \"YY.YY%\", \"recall\": \"ZZ.ZZ%\", \"f_score\": \"WW.WW%\" } \"correct_chars\": C, Fig. 21.

Compare them on Aesthetic Value, Prompt Alignment, Text Accuracy, and Overall Preference. General Evaluation Protocol: For each of the four categories: (1) Provide brief textual analysis justifying your choice. (2) Make definitive choice: \"L\" (Left is superior), \"R\" (Right is superior), or \"none\". When to Choose \"none\": You must select \"none\" for category if: a) and are tied or indistinguishable in quality for that category. b) The category is not applicable. c) After careful review, you cannot definitively determine superior side. d) Crucially: and exhibit clear, offsetting strengths and weaknesses within that specific category. If excels in one aspect of the category while excels in another, and these trade-offs make declaring an overall winner for that category difficult or misleading, choose \"none\". Do not attempt to weigh these distinct, offsetting pros and cons to force preference. Your careful judgment is vital. Original Prompt: \"`original_prompt`\" Please provide your evaluation in the JSON format specified below. (1) Aesthetic Value: Evaluate visual appeal: harmony and consistency of background style, text style (if present), thematic consistency between background/text, overall content/text layout, and how the artistic style (background, content, text) aligns with the \"Original Prompt\". `aesthetic_value_explanation`: Your brief analysis. `aesthetic_value`: Choose \"L\", \"R\", or \"none\" (if L/R are equally pleasing/coherent, choice is impossible, or they exhibit offsetting aesthetic strengths/weaknesses as per the \"When to Choose none\" protocol). Respond with: {{\"aesthetic_value\": \"L/R/none\", \"aesthetic_value_explanation\": \"Your analysis...\"}} (2) Prompt Alignment (excluding text elements and artistic style): Evaluate how well non-textual elements (subjects, objects, scene) in and match the \"Original Prompt\". `prompt_alignment_explanation`: Your brief analysis. `prompt_alignment`: Choose \"L\", \"R\", or \"none\" (if L/R align equally well/poorly, its too close to call, or they exhibit offsetting strengths in alignment as per the \"When to Choose none\" protocol). Respond with: {{\"prompt_alignment\": \"L/R/none\", \"prompt_alignment_explanation\": \"Your analysis...\"}} (3) Text Accuracy (if applicable): Evaluate text in and based only on textual content specified/implied in the \"Original Prompt\". Focus only on: Accuracy: All prompt-specified words/characters present, no typos/misspellings/alterations? Recall: All intended textual elements from prompt included? Any missing words/phrases? Ignore text style, font, visual appeal, legibility (unless it prevents determining accuracy/recall), and placement. `text_accuracy_explanation`: Your brief analysis. `text_accuracy`: First, determine if \"none\" is appropriate (as per the general \"When to Choose none\" protocol, especially if is better on Accuracy but on Recall, or vice-versa; or if performance is identical/text N/A). If \"none\" is not chosen, select \"L\" if is demonstrably superior overall in combined text accuracy and recall, or \"R\" if is. Respond with: {{\"text_accuracy\": \"L/R/none\", \"text_accuracy_explanation\": \"Your analysis...\"}} (4) Overall Preference: Considering all above aspects (aesthetics, alignment, text accuracy) and any other factors relevant to the \"Original Prompt\". `overall_preference_explanation`: Your brief analysis. `overall_preference`: Choose \"L\", \"R\", or \"none\" (if L/R are equally preferred, choice is impossible, or they present compelling but different and offsetting strengths across categories making neither holistically superior, as per the \"When to Choose none\" protocol). Respond with: {{\"overall_preference\": \"L/R/none\", \"overall_preference_explanation\": \"Your analysis...\"}} Fig. 22. Prompt for Preference Evaluation. PosterCraft: Rethinking High-Quality Aesthetic Poster Generation in Unified Framework 21 Prompt 11.3 (Preference Evaluation) Respond ONLY with single JSON object in the following format: { \"aesthetic_value\": \"your_choice_for_aesthetic\", \"aesthetic_value_explanation\": \"Your brief analysis for aesthetics...\", \"prompt_alignment\": \"your_choice_for_alignment\", \"prompt_alignment_explanation\": \"Your brief analysis for prompt alignment...\", \"text_accuracy\": \"your_choice_for_text\", \"text_accuracy_explanation\": \"Your brief analysis for text accuracy...\", \"overall_preference\": \"your_choice_for_overall\", \"overall_preference_explanation\": \"Your brief analysis for overall preference...\" } Replace placeholders with your choices (\"L\", \"R\", \"none\") and analyses. Strict constraints: Only output the JSON object. No additional text or markdown. Each choice value (e.g., \"aesthetic_value\") must be \"L\", \"R\", or \"none\". Explanation fields must contain your textual analysis. Fig. 23. Prompt for Preference Evaluation.

Your expertise ensures that the final approach integrates key aspects from different suggestions or follows single selected approach in full. Background The user has reviewed previous retouching approaches and provided feedback or specific instructions for final retouching plan that aligns with their creative goals. Ambition Your goal is to either choose one of the previously proposed approaches that best matches the users vision or create new, cohesive retouching approach by combining elements from different suggestions. Ensure that the final approach fully respects the users instructions and creative intent. User Instruction User says: \"{user_instruction}\" Task (1) Review the provided retouching approaches and the users feedback or instructions. (2) Decide whether to: Select single approach that fits the users description. Create new approach that integrates relevant aspects from different suggestions. (3) Final Approach: Describe the adjustments to Light (exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, blacks, and whites) and Color (temperature, tint, vibrance, and saturation). For each adjustment, specify which objects or areas of the image are most affected and describe the specific details (e.g., the intricate carvings on the roof are highlighted by gentle increase in exposure). Explain the expected visual effect on these objects, such as the water reflections appear richer and more defined or the sky becomes softer and more inviting. For each individual HSL adjustment (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Magenta), explain why it is necessary and describe the expected visual change for specific objects (e.g., the red tones in the window frames become more vivid to emphasize their ornate design). Organize the description as step-by-step plan, indicating the sequence of adjustments. Guidelines for Description: Avoid providing exact numerical valuesfocus on explaining how the adjustments affect the images visual presentation. Mention specific objects, areas, and their corresponding changes to help visualize the effect. Ensure the approach remains detailed, logical, and cohesive, and does not exceed 100 words. Fig. 24.
