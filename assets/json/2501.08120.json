            "content": "Discovery is driven by the ability to think deeply, reflect, and iteratively refine ideas before arriving at conclusions. Emergent artificial intelligence (AI) methods have achieved success in domains such as natural language processing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], materials science, and molecular biology, including protein folding [8], and others. However, much of these advances rely on models that produce outputs directly, without an explicit intermediate reasoning process akin to scientific thinking, and hence, generally lack self-awareness and capacity to reflect. For AI to ultimately accelerate discovery, we must develop systems capable of reasoning in relational and symbolical manners [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], reflecting critically, and explaining their answers in an iterative process that mirrors scientific methods of exploration. When we solve problem by identifying how things are connected and flow together, we often discover template that works far beyond your original situation, serving as model that can be understood in different context or applied to new scenario to extrapolate. For example, the hierarchical structure of bone, combining stiffness and toughness Corresponding author. In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Mapping to Generalized Representation: Abstraction IS-A INFLUENCES RELATES-TO α, β, δ, , , ... Task Graph Representation Symbolic Representation Relevant Materials & Concepts, ..., Hypothesis Final Answer Other tasks (map to similar abstract representations) Figure 1: Visualization of generalization via abstraction. Top: Example, where phenomenon in an original domain (here: protein materials fracture, specifically flaw-tolerance in alpha-helical protein meshes [14]) is modeled as relational abstract patterns, and then used to describe distinct phenomena in other domains. The diagram shows how structural patterns in protein materials can be abstracted and applied across domains through categorical mappings and graph-based relationships. The three-level hierarchy demonstrates functorial relationships between source domain concepts (protein materials), abstract pattern recognition, and diverse applications in networks, social systems, biological systems, and musical composition. Bottom: Flowchart for visualizing the process from task to graph representation (with shared relational descriptions such as IS-A, RELATES-TO, and INFLUENCES), symbolic abstraction, hypothesis generation, and the final answer. The vertical dashed line with mathematical symbols (α, β, δ, ) represents the shared representation of all problems in tokenized form, where the model learns to generalize representations across domains. 2 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR across scales, has inspired the design of lightweight, durable materials for aerospace and architecture [15, 16, 17]. Category theory [18, 19, 10, 11, 9], branch of mathematics that emphasizes how objects relate rather than their internal detail, can be powerful tool to construct models of complex phenomena through lens on relational aspects. At its core, category theory emphasizes morphismsarrows that represent interactions or mappings between objects. Such an approach can reveal hidden patterns - where the same structures keep appearing in nature, human organizations, technology, and science. By mapping out these connections and flows, we can unlock powerful solutions that have worked across many fields. We can view this like discovering universal language that helps translate successful ideas from one domain to another, letting us recognize and apply useful, and transferrable, patterns wherever they might be useful (Figure 1). In the example depicted in the figure, we show how flaw-tolerance in alpha-helical protein meshes can be modeled as relational abstract patterns, and then used to describe phenomena in other domains [14, 11, 20, 9]. central concept is that of an isomorphism, special type of morphism that establishes structural equivalence between objects, enabling insights from one domain to be applied to another. For example, consider Newtons second law of motion, = ma, which describes the proportionality between force , mass m, and acceleration a. This relationship is isomorphic to Ohms law in electrical circuits, = IR, where voltage plays the role of force, current corresponds to acceleration, and resistance serves as the proportionality factor akin to mass. Both laws can be abstracted into general form, = kx, where represents the driving factor, the response, and the proportionality constant. This abstraction reveals that the structural relationships governing these systems are fundamentally equivalent, even though the physical quantities differ. By identifying such isomorphisms, category theory allows scientists to transfer insights across domains, uncovering deep connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena. This approach not only simplifies complex systems but also provides systematic framework for discovering universal laws, as it emphasizes relational properties that transcend specific instances. Conversely, if we can discover isomorphisms directly from data, it opens the possibility of uncovering new theories and equations by identifying deep structural parallels across disparate domains, revealing universal principles that might otherwise remain hidden. 1.1 Modeling isomorphisms for generalization To model isomorphisms computationally, we require neural network architecture capable of capturing the structural equivalences between relational systems. Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) are particularly well-suited for this purpose. GINs are designed to operate on graph-structured data, where nodes represent objects and edges capture relationships or interactions. Unlike traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which may struggle to distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs, GINs achieve maximum expressiveness for distinguishing graph structures by leveraging theoretically grounded update rule that closely resembles the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test [21]. In GIN, the node update function aggregates features from neighboring nodes using weighted sum and applies learned multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to the result, ensuring the network can capture higher-order structural properties. For example, to model the isomorphism between Newtons second law, = a, and Ohms law, = R, GIN can represent the relationships between variables and operators (e.g., force, mass, acceleration, =, ) as nodes and their interactions as edges. By learning the graph embeddings, the GIN can identify the shared relational structure underlying these systems, demonstrating their equivalence. After processing, the embeddings for both equations would be nearly identical in the latent space, reflecting their structural similarity and isomorphic relationship as they can be mapped to the same representation (see, Section S1 and Figure S3, for an example). This capability to recognize and model isomorphisms makes GINs powerful tool for tasks that involve reasoning over relational data, such as predicting properties of molecules, designing robust materials, or uncovering universal scientific laws. How does this relate to Transformer-based LLMs? Recent work has shown that Transformers implicitly function as graph isomorphism neural networks [13], which provides powerful lens for explicitly integrating graph-based reasoning into these architectures. Whereas [13] focused on theoretically grounded advancements in the Transformer architecture itself to strengthen its expressive capacity, in this paper we focus on utilizing standard Transformer interpreted with the expressive power of GIN, and endow it with explicit capabilities to conduct in-situ graph reasoning and symbolic deduction. We hypothesize that by explicitly leveraging graph theory within Transformers can unlock new levels of performance, generalization, and interpretability, accelerating progress in various scientific domains. Moreover, modeling complex principles can be inspired from biology, specifically the use of hierarchically organized systems that utilize some of the core ideas of category theory in materials and scientific exploration, where natural systems are found to often reuse relational patterns and mechanisms such as amino acids, DNA, and others. Building on these ideas, it has been suggested that inspiration for such advances may come from biology, such as emergent hierarchical intelligence based on agentic systems and other strategies that mimic biological materials and design principles [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Related principles include concerted problem solving as illustrated in recent study of ant dynamics [27], providing ample examples for latent opportunities to discover mechanisms that can be translated across domains. 3 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 2: Overview of the approach used in this paper, presenting the concept of multi-step reflection (panel a), graph-based modeling of context and tasks (panel b), abstract pattern formulation (panel c), and finally, integrated in the multi-stage reasoning mechanisms (panel d). Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating human-like text and extracting insights from scientific literature. grand challenge in the application of AI models in science in particular remains to develop algorithms that yield more sophisticated reasoning mechanisms [25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. These models often excel in fluency and pattern recognition, yet typically lack the ability to engage in structured reasoning. Addressing this limitation, earlier work like PReFLexOR (abbreviation of: Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) [36] introduced framework where models were developed that innately develop thinking and reflection strategy before answering, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to refine reasoning through iterative reflection and dynamic feedback loops, inspired by earlier research [37, 38, 39, 40]. key goal of the work reported in this paper is to develop strategy that allows AI models to not simply retrieve information but to learn underlying abstractions and relational motives, and then use these insights to generalize across new domains and ultimately to expand its understanding and capabilities to generalize. Building on this foundation, we expand the concept of thinking before answering to incorporate in situ graph-based reasoning. Graphs provide powerful framework for representing relationships, causality, and structures inherent in scientific problems (Figure 2). From molecular interactions, dynamics, to material properties, many scientific phenomena are naturally represented as graphs. By enabling models to autonomously construct and manipulate these symbolic graph representations, we create model that mimics the reflective, iterative reasoning processes integral to scientific inquiry. In Transformers, knowledge is represented as superposition of potentialities that collapse into specific outputs when conditioned on tasks. This interpretation offers framework for enhancing both reasoning and creativity. We show how, by balancing structured coherence with divergent exploration, models can traverse new ideas, generating insights while maintaining rigorous, task-aligned solutions. 4 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR 1.2 Foundations of in-situ graph reasoning In this work, we introduce novel approach that unifies the linguistic fluency of LLMs with the relational reasoning capabilities that have been quite successful in architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our model extends the reflective capabilities introduced in the original PReFLexOR model, enabling the construction of graph-based intermediate reasoning mechanisms, by taking advantage of the flexible capabilities of the transformer architecture. Through these symbolic representations via special tokens, the model engages in thinking phase, reasoning over the graph to refine its understanding before generating an answer. This approach not only enhances interpretability but also improves the models ability to solve complex scientific problems requiring relational and structural reasoning. We achieve this by formalizing reasoning as structured mapping: where task produces knowledge graph G, abstract patterns P, and final answers A. The knowledge graph : (G, P, A), encodes concepts as nodes and relationships as directed edges E. = (V , E) (1) (2) By explicitly constructing and abstracting relational graphs, the model can encode structural information that standard next-token prediction often overlooks or treats only implicitly. In this setup, each entity and its relations become first-class objects in the learned representation, enabling the network to detect and exploit common subgraph motifs and isomorphisms that recur across different inputs. Unlike pure sequence-based transformers, which must infer latent structure solely from token order and distributional cues, graph-driven approach anchors learning in explicitly linked entities, preserving both local and global connectivity. As result, it is not only easier for the model to discover universal features (such as repeated subgraphs or underlying algebraic forms) but also more straightforward to apply symbolic abstractions, since the graph representation makes these recurring structures and higher-level patterns more salient and amenable to consistent transformations. Our model thereby offers opportunities for diverse use cases in AI for science and beyond. Tasks such as multi-step reasoning, hypothesis generation, and causal inference become more robust and explainable. This work bridges connectionist and symbolic paradigms, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in scientific domains [41, 42, 43]. By creating models that have more explicit process of relational deliberation, both symbolically and structurally, before answering, we take an important step toward AI systems capable of true scientific reasoning and discovery. 1.3 Outline of this paper The plan of the paper is as follows. First, we briefly review the PReFLexOR architecture published in earlier work [36], then describe the training process of developing Graph-PReFLexOR, and then review several case studies of how the method can be applied. We conclude with final thoughts and discussion on future opportunities."

            "content": "We report the results of series of experiments and analyses conducted based on the model. We start with review of the PReFLexOR framework [36], how we adapted it for graph reasoning capability, and then move on to the results of the experiments conducted. We conclude with discussion of the results, interpretations, and an outlook to future opportunities. 2.1 Review of PReFLexOR PRefLexOR, Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning [36], is framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of language models by integrating preference optimization and recursive reasoning (Figure 3). The approach relies on the introduction of special tokens such as <thinking>..</thinking> and <reflect>..</reflect>, which explicitly mark distinct phases of reasoning, enabling structured generation and iterative refinement. During training, the model undergoes two stages: Structured Thought Integration, where reasoning processes are guided using special tokens and optimized through Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), and Independent Reasoning Development, which leverages masking of thinking tokens and applies Efficient Exact Optimization (EXO) [44] to align final outputs with preferred reasoning patterns without prescribing the specific reasoning steps. Thinking tokens allow the model to simulate intermediate reasoning steps, while masking ensures that the model infers the best reasoning pathways without direct supervision. We note that EXOs reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence [45] objective promotes mode-seeking behavior, emphasizing 5 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 3: Overview of the PRefLexOR framework as reported in [36], presented here for completeness. The training process involves two stages: (1) Structured Thought Integration Training, focusing on incorporating structured reasoning components, and (2) Independent Reasoning Development, aimed at fostering model autonomy in reasoning. During inference, the Recursive Reasoning Algorithm is employed to iteratively refine responses. Below, the role of reasoning components is depicted in the two training phases, showing transitions from unmasked to masked reasoning. dominant reasoning strategies over diluted alternatives. By dynamically generating datasets and employing recursive feedback loops, PRefLexOR enables models to self-teach, iteratively refining their reasoning through on-the-fly task generation and reflection. This combination of token-driven structure, recursive refinement, and preference alignment makes PRefLexOR suitable foundation for reasoning-intensive applications. As was shown in the original paper [36], with trained model the reasoning process can be iteratively refined at inference time, where the model generates intermediate reasoning (thinking phase), the critic evaluates it (reflection phase), and then produces improved responses. Formally, the reasoning at step i, Ri, is represented as: where fcritic applies feedback Fi to refine the intermediate reasoning. At each step, reflection is guided by feedback on gaps or inconsistencies in Ri, enabling the next iteration to improve alignment with the desired output. The final response is derived after refinement steps as: Ri+1 = fcritic(Ri, Fi), (3) where extracts the synthesized final answer. During training, masking is applied to tokens embedded within <thinking>..</thinking>, requiring the model to infer reasoning paths indirectly while optimizing the final output. This iterative combination of thinking and reflection, structured via tokens and recursive refinement, ensures that the model autonomously enhances its reasoning capabilities, providing accurate and well-aligned outputs. = g(RN ), (4) Here is an example: Basic structure of the reasoning strategy using thinking phase before answering.

Details are included in the Materials and Methods section, but we review highlights here. All training is done on top of the meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model, small but performant base LLM that serves as the foundational platform for development. Structured reasoning is generated on-the-fly during training as described in the Materials and Methods section. At its core, the method constructs dynamic knowledge graphs in-situ = (V , E), where nodes represent key concepts extracted from enriched context, and edges encode relationships such as IS-A, RELATES-TO, and INFLUENCES, common and shared relational descriptions. These relationships are quantified using semantic scoring function (ci, cj; rk), which evaluates the significance of relationships rk between concepts ci and cj. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is employed to enrich the input context and identify abstract patterns and dependencies within the graph, enabling higher-order reasoning. The thinking section organizes reasoning into structured headings, including Core Concepts and Relationships, Reasoning Steps, and Abstract Patterns, providing framework for logical progression and shared token representation to encourage generation (see, Figure 1 and the discussion in Section S1). For example, the Core Concepts and Relationships heading defines the key nodes and their connections in the knowledge graph, while Reasoning Steps outlines step-by-step deductions using the generalized formalisms. The Abstract Patterns section summarizes these relationships into symbolic transformations, such as α β γ δ ϵ, with proportional dependencies α ϵ indicating critical links. These structured headings not only guide the models reasoning but also ensure interpretability and coherence in outputs and aid to boost extrapolation capacity in recursive reasoning steps. Special tokens delineate the reasoning phases, facilitating recursive refinement of the knowledge graph and symbolic abstractions during training and inference. By uniting graph-based reasoning, symbolic methods, and structured thinking sections, Graph-PReFLexOR achieves robust, interpretable performance in generating high-quality responses for reasoning-intensive tasks. We train the model using the same multi-stage training process as done in the original model [36], featuring first ORPO and then DPO-EXO. The training dataset is the same as in the original paper, consisting of raw text of around 1,000 papers in the realm of biological and bio-inspired materials [30]. 2.3 Detailed analysis of example responses: Single task-response pair In the first example, we task the model as follows, challenging the model to answer question that partially involves materials-specific task but also invokes domain that was not included in the training data, to test how well the model can extrapolate its structured reasoning to other domains that were not included in the training set. The task is: User task User: Propose new idea to relate music and materials. The model responds first by thinking about the problem by outputting series of thoughts enclosed within the <thinking> and </thinking> tokens. The response closely follows the structured approach developed during training. First, the model provides knowledge graph: Knowledge graph **Knowledge Graph:** 1. **Music** -[IS-A]-> **Audio Signal** 2. **Material** -[IS-A]-> **Physical Substance** 3. **Nonlinear Dynamic Response** -[RELATES-TO]-> **Material** 4. **Frequency** -[RELATES-TO]-> **Music** 5. **Nonlinear Dynamic Response** -[INFLUENCES]-> **Materials Mechanical Properties** 6. **Music** -[INFLUENCES]-> **Nonlinear Dynamic Response** -[INFLUENCES]-> **Materials Mechanical Properties** 7. **Frequency Spectrum** -[RELATES-TO]-> **Music** 8. **Frequency Spectrum** -[RELATES-TO]-> **Materials Mechanical Properties** 9. **Material** -[INFLUENCES]-> **Frequency Spectrum** -[INFLUENCES]-> **Music** 10. **Material Selection** -[IS-A]-> **Material** -[RELATES-TO]-> **Music** -[RELATES-TO]-> **Materials Mechanical Properties** Next, the model develops an abstract reasoning pattern as follows: In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 4: Overview of the data generated in response to the question: Propose new idea to relate music and materials. The knowledge graph (top) illustrates the relationships between core concepts: music (blue), material properties (purple), and frequency spectrum (green). Key relationships include IS-A hierarchies (e.g., Music is an Audio Signal) and influence paths through nonlinear dynamic responses. The abstract pattern (bottom) formalizes these interactions through triple system (α, β, γ) with proportional influence (α β) and feedback loop (γ α). The integration between graph and pattern manifests in multiple ways: the music-to-material influence path in the graph maps to α β in the pattern; the materials mechanical properties feedback in the graph corresponds to the essential condition γ α; and the frequency spectrum mediation shown in the graph provides the physical mechanism for the proportional influence (α β) in the pattern. Dotted lines explicitly map concrete elements to their abstract counterparts, demonstrating how the theoretical framework emerges from and guides the practical implementation. This dual representation captures both the detailed mechanisms of music-material interaction and its fundamental mathematical structure. 8 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Abstract pattern **Abstract Pattern:** α β γ **Key Transformation Rule:** α β **Essential Condition:** γ α **Explanation:** - α represents **Music**, β represents **Material**, and γ represents **Materials Mechanical Properties**. - The abstract pattern α β γ - The key transformation rule α β indicates that Music (α) has proportional influence on Materials Mechanical Properties (β). - The essential condition γ α signifies that Materials Mechanical Properties (γ) are influenced by Music (α), creating feedback loop in the system. Pattern Context: Inspire new method to tune and control the mechanical properties of materials by analyzing and manipulating the frequency spectrum of music. This method leverages the dynamic responses of materials to different frequencies, mimicking the effects of music on materials. shows the direct relationship between Music, Material, and Materials Mechanical Properties. The model then proceeds to develop series of additional structured mechanisms (reasoning steps, relevant materials, design principles, material properties, hypothesis, background), building on these initial steps. These are: Additional thinking steps **Reasoning Steps**: 1. Music has dynamic responses on materials, similar to how it affects human emotions. 2. Analyze the frequency spectrum of music to understand its dynamic responses. 3. Use the frequency spectrum to tune and control the mechanical properties of materials. 4. This method leverages the relationship between musics frequency spectrum and material responses. **Relevant Materials or Concepts**: - Nonlinear Dynamic Response - Frequency Spectrum - Material Selection - Tuning and Control of Mechanical Properties **Design Principles**: - **Frequency Spectrum Analysis**: Study the dynamic responses of materials to different frequencies. - **Material Selection**: Choose materials with nonlinear dynamic responses to optimize mechanical property tuning. - **Frequency Spectrum Manipulation**: Modify the frequency spectrum of music to influence material responses. - **Tuning and Control**: Use the manipulated frequency spectrum to tune and control the mechanical properties of selected materials. **Material Properties**: - **Nonlinear Dynamic Response**: Materials exhibit nonlinear responses to external stimuli, such as vibrations or frequencies. - **Frequency Dependence**: Material responses vary with different frequencies, allowing for tuning and control. - **Mechanical Property Tuning**: Materials mechanical properties can be adjusted by manipulating their nonlinear dynamic responses to specific frequencies. **Hypothesis**: \"Musics frequency spectrum can tune and control the nonlinear dynamic responses of materials, mimicking the effects of music on materials.\" **Additional Background**: The relationship between music and materials involves analyzing and manipulating the dynamic responses of materials to different frequencies. This can be achieved by studying the nonlinear dynamic responses of materials to external stimuli, such as vibrations or frequencies. By understanding how materials react to various frequencies, its possible to tune and control their mechanical properties. This approach can be applied to materials used in various applications, from engineering to biomedical devices. The key is to select materials that exhibit significant nonlinear responses to specific frequencies, allowing for targeted manipulation of their properties. All of the above content was enclosed within thinking tokens. Once these are completed, the model produces the final answer, shown in Text Box 1. We can see that the output features rich content that we can analyze. First, Figure 4 depicts visualization of the knowledge graph and abstract reasoning pattern. We find that the relationship between music and materials is formalized through an abstract pattern derived from their fundamental interactions, where the model proposes the triple system (α, β, γ) where α represents music as an audio signal, β represents the material as physical substance, and γ represents the materials mechanical properties. The core relationship follows the pattern α β γ with the key transformation rule α β and essential condition γ α, proposing closed feedback loop. This system manifests through nonlinear dynamic responses of materials to different frequencies, where the frequency spectrum of music directly influences material properties. The relationship leverages the dynamic responses of materials to different frequencies, mimicking the effects of music on materials. Through frequency spectrum analysis and manipulation, the proposed method enables tuning and control of mechanical properties such as possibly damping, stiffness, and damping capacity. This approach opens possibilities for non-destructive material testing, property tuning, and biomedical applications, where the nonlinear dynamic response provides mechanism for controlled material modification through specific frequency interactions. Thinking about the idea more deeply, the proposals main novelty lies in its symmetrical conceptualization of musicmaterial interaction as feedback loop. Rather than just treating music as an input that affects materials (which would 9 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR be more obvious), it proposes cyclic system where material properties can also influence the musical response. The proposal relies heavily on well-known concepts like nonlinear dynamic responses and frequency analysis, but the practical implementation focuses on fairly standard approaches (frequency spectrum analysis, material selection). The proposed methodology presents notable innovations in relating music and materials, particularly through its biomimetic foundation that draws parallels between material responses and human emotional reactions to music (α response). The approach extends beyond conventional frequency-response studies by establishing comprehensive framework that encompasses specific technical implementations through dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), concrete property targets (damping, stiffness), and notably, potential biomedical applications for cancer and neurological disorders. The methodologys novelty lies not only in its theoretical framework but in its practical manifestation through non-contact and non-destructive testing methods. The proposal demonstrates depth in addressing implementation challenges, particularly in material selection optimization and frequency spectrum manipulation. Critically, it acknowledges and provides direction for key technical hurdles, including the scalability of the method to larger structures, the complexity of identifying materials with appropriate nonlinear dynamic responses, and the need for robust theoretical models to predict material behavior under musical frequency stimulation. The potential impact is amplified by its extension into biomedical applications, suggesting bridge between materials science and medical diagnostics through music-inspired techniques. This comprehensive treatment of both theoretical foundations and practical challenges, coupled with the biomimetic inspiration and medical applications, establishes the proposal as significant innovation in material property tuning methodologies, transcending traditional approaches to frequency-based material manipulation. The innovations fundamental strength emerges from its adherence to the abstract pattern α β γ α, where the cyclic relationship enables unique feedback system. The proportionality rule α β manifests in the biomimetic response mechanism, while the essential condition γ α is realized through the materials frequency-dependent behavior. This creates dynamic system where music (α) influences material properties (γ) through material response (β), while the resulting property changes create new response patterns, forming continuous adaptive loop. As an interpretation, the relationship can be viewed as coupled system where each components influence is nonlinearly dependent on the others: γ = (α, β) and β = g(γ, α), capturing both the immediate response and long-term evolution of material properties under musical influence. This mathematical framework elegantly supports the proposals practical applications while maintaining the fundamental symmetry of the original abstract pattern. 2.4 In-situ graph generation and recursive reasoning through multi-agent modeling The earlier example showed that the model was able to expand its capabilities beyond the materials-science focused training data and was able to successfully integrate different domains into the structured reasoning paradigm. In the next experiment, we task the model as follows: User task User: Integrate snowflake and ant behavior to design new tough material made from protein. However, unlike before where one can respond with single shot, here we use recursive reasoning by using two-agent setup where the thinking steps are critiqued, then improved, and fed back to the model. Ultimately, an integrated response is developed by the model that incorporates the various ideas, concepts, and details developed during the recursive process. Figure 5 shows flowchart of the process used. In the example discussed below, we use = 3 iterations until the final answer is produced through multiple refinement steps. Each iteration in the algorithm produces an intermediate result that is critiqued and improved as delineated in Figure 5. The final answer after iteration = 3 is shown in Text Box 2. Once the maximum number of iterations has been reached, we develop an integrated answer that uses the responses from all three iterations to develop the final response to the task. For the example discussed here, the final, integrated answer is: 10 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Graph Reasoning Model (Agent #1) Start Initial Response Iterative process Iteration < N? No Reflection: Generate Critique using Agent Improve Thinking Process based on Critique Generate Improved Response Critic (Agent #2) Take Last Response No Integrate Responses? Yes Integrate all Responses End Figure 5: Graph-PRefLexOR Recursive Reasoning Algorithm, using graph reasoning and abstract representations of relational mechanics, using multi-agent system with Agent #1 being the Graph Reasoning model, and Agent #2 being general-purpose critic model. The reflection is generated using the Critic agent and then used to improve the thinking process. This resembles an iterative approach leveraging the Reasoning Model and general-purpose Critic Model to generate, refine, and optionally integrate responses. As before, the process ultimately involves generating initial responses, extracting reflections, improving thinking processes, and creating new responses based on refined thinking, with an optional final integration step. The algorithm relies on extracting thinking processes (indicated via <thinking>..</thinking>) and reflection processes generated by the Critic. The sampled responses can either be used in their final state or integrated into an amalgamated response that shows very rich facets in the scientific process. 11 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 6: Overview of the graph data generated in response to the question: Integrate snowflake and ant behavior to design new tough material made from protein. The figure depicts both the knowledge graph alone (panel a) and an integration of the knowledge graph with the abstract pattern representation (panel b). Results after the first iteration, = 1, are shown. 12 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Final integrated answer from recursive Graph-PReFLexOR Designing new tough material made from protein inspired by snowflake and ant behavior involves creating protein-based material with fractal patterns and hierarchical structures, similar to snowflakes and ants, to enhance toughness, adaptability, and diversity in applications. The design principle for creating such material is to mimic fractal patterns and hierarchical structures, inspired by snowflakes, and self-organization, inspired by ants, to enhance toughness, adaptability, and diversity in applications. The key components of this design are: 1. **Fractal Patterns (Snowflake Inspiration):** Incorporate fractal patterns and self-similarity to create intricate, complex structures. Use branching patterns and scaling laws to create patterns at multiple length scales. This will enhance the materials toughness and adaptability. 2. **Self-Organization (Ant Inspiration):** Design the protein material to mimic the self-organization and hierarchical structures found in ant colonies. Encourage self-organization through hierarchical structures at multiple length scales. This will promote adaptability and diversity in the materials properties. 3. **Hierarchical Structure:** Incorporate multiple length scales to create complex, tough materials. This will enhance the materials toughness and adaptability. The design process involves: 1. **Design Protein Material:** Create protein-based material with fractal patterns and hierarchical structures. Incorporate self-organization and hierarchical structures at multiple length scales. 2. **Test and Refine:** Test the protein materials toughness, adaptability, and diversity in properties. Refine the design based on the test results to enhance the materials performance. The material properties of the designed protein-based material are: - **Fractal Pattern Mimicry:** Inspired by snowflakes, the protein material exhibits fractal patterns and self-similarity. - **Hierarchical Structure:** Mimics ant behavior by creating hierarchical structures at multiple length scales. - **Self-Organization:** Encourages self-organization, similar to ants, to enhance toughness and adaptability. - **Toughness Enhancement:** Combines fractal patterns and hierarchical structures to create tough, protein-based materials. - **Adaptability:** Designed for diverse applications by mimicking snowflake and ant patterns.

The challenges and opportunities associated with designing protein-based materials inspired by snowflake and ant behavior are: - **Scalability:** Maintaining fractal patterns and hierarchical structures at multiple length scales while scaling up the material. - **Self-Organization:** Encouraging self-organization in protein materials to enhance toughness and adaptability. - **Biocompatibility:** Ensuring the protein material is biocompatible and non-toxic for potential applications. - **Synthesis Methods:** Developing efficient and scalable methods for synthesizing protein-based materials with fractal patterns and hierarchical structures. Future research directions include: - **Fractal Geometry of Protein Materials:** Investigating the fractal geometry of protein materials and its role in enhancing toughness and adaptability. - **Ant-Inspired Protein Materials:** Developing protein-based materials that mimic ant behavior, such as self-organization and hierarchical structures. - **Biodegradable Protein Materials:** Designing protein-based materials that are biodegradable and sustainable. - **Synthesis Methods for Fractal Protein Materials:** Developing efficient and scalable methods for synthesizing protein-based materials with fractal patterns and hierarchical structures. In conclusion, designing protein-based materials inspired by snowflake and ant behavior offers promising approach to creating tough, adaptable, and diverse materials. By mimicking fractal patterns and hierarchical structures, and self-organization, protein materials can be engineered to enhance toughness, adaptability, and diversity in applications. However, challenges such as scalability, self-organization, biocompatibility, and synthesis methods need to be addressed. Future research should focus on fractal geometry, ant-inspired protein materials, biodegradable protein materials, and efficient synthesis methods to unlock the full potential of protein-based materials. For comparison, the answer from standard (non-fine-tuned) model is shown in Text Box S1. We note that this response does not include any thinking section (and hence, no graph reasoning or abstraction), and solely consists of the text as provided. We first compare the results from the first iteration of the graph reasoning model with the standard model. From the standpoint of scientist at high technical level, the graph reasoning based response demonstrates superior intellectual depth and reasoning quality. The response provides highly systematic framework for material design, detailing explicit parameters (e.g., protein selection, fractal pattern generation, hierarchical structure formation) and an iterative validation process that reflects rigorous scientific methodology and clear delineation in graph form (Figure 6). This structured approach aligns well with the expectations of graduate-level research, as it includes clear constraints, performance criteria, and testing protocols akin to what one might find in peer-reviewed scientific literature. By contrast, the response from the standard model showcases more conceptual, broader-stroke approach and lacks the comprehensive methodological granularity seen in the other response. While it does incorporate topics such as self-healing peptides and adaptive camouflage, its overall elaboration remains more conceptual than procedural. Thus the graph reasoning result more closely meets the benchmarks of high rigor by systematically addressing design parameters, experimental validation, and scalability concerns. We compare the two responses using GPT-4o as evaluator, with results shown in Table 1. Graph-PReFLexOR systematically addresses the design principles (fractals, hierarchical structures, self-organization) and walks through potential challenges (scalability, synthesis methods, biocompatibility) with more methodical cause-and-effect flow and hence offers deeper theoretical reasoning overall. In contrast, the comparison with the non-fine tuned model is 13 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR much shorter and more general. It does not dig as deeply into the theoretical underpinnings, deep materials-specific reasoning, or longer-term challenges. The graph-based response offers more robust, multi-layered reasoning.

Response 1 explicitly ties abstract and biological principles to practical applications, supported by the graph. Response 2 mentions potential applications but without detailed pathways. The graph in Response 1 enhances intellectual depth, reasoning, and academic rigor. Response 2 lacks graph entirely. Response 1 excels in intellectual depth, reasoning, and academic rigor due to the graph and systematic methodology. Response 2, while clear and concise, falls short in depth and structure. Table 1: Comparison of responses, as obtained using GPT-4o as judge. Graph-PReFLexOR responses are delineated as Response 1, and the reference model as Response 2. The graph reasoning model performs much better overall, with an average score of 9.7 vs. 6.4. 2.5 Growing knowledge garden via in-situ graph generation and knowledge expansion In this next experiment we use the capability of the graph reasoning model to generate graphs that describe phenomena in relational manner and apply it to explore ever-expanding graph structures by repeatedly prompting the model. This allows us to recursively grow graph, starting from an initial concept or response to task, and to examine whether the model can blend creative and analytical reasoning. The initial task is: User task User: Write song by incorporating snow flakes and flower petals.

Snowflakes symbolize the serenity and uniqueness of winter, while flower petals signify the delicacy and renewal of spring.

There are other elements in the response, as reflected here: Reasoning steps **Reasoning Steps**: 1. Snowflakes and flower petals are both natural phenomena. 2.

This can be achieved through lyrics or even instrumental descriptions. 2. **Metaphors**: Draw parallels between the delicate nature of snowflakes and flower petals and the human experience. For instance, snowflakes could represent individuality and uniqueness, while flower petals could symbolize growth and renewal. 3. **Seasonal themes**: Explore the contrast between winter (snowflakes) and spring (flower petals) to create narrative that highlights the cyclical nature of life and the beauty in each season. 4. **Musical motifs**: Use specific musical motifs or melodies to evoke the feeling of snowflakes (e.g., soft, repetitive patterns) and flower petals (e.g., light, airy, whimsical). 5. **Collaboration**: Consider co-writing with poet or lyricist to craft lyrics that incorporate these natural elements in meaningful and impactful way. [...] The final response after the thinking section is: 15 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 7: Resulting graph in response to the task: Write song by incorporating snow flakes and flower petals. The visualization depicts the knowledge graph integrated with the abstract pattern representation. 16 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Final response **Song: \"Snowflakes and Flower Petals\"** **Verse 1** In winters chill, where snowflakes fall Each one unique, delicate call Dance upon the breeze, fleeting sight moments beauty, lost in the night **Chorus** But even in the cold, theres warmth to find In the petals of the flower, left behind Delicate, colorful, soft to the touch symbol of renewal, in the winters hush **Verse 2** In springs awakening, where petals unfold tapestry of colors, story to be told Whimsical, light, gentle caress promise of new life, in every tender dress **Chorus** But even in the warmth, theres serenity to find In the snowflakes that fall, in the stillness of the mind Unique, work of art, fleeting sight symbol of peace, in the quiet of the night **Bridge** In the contrast, we find harmony balance of opposites, symphony Snowflakes and flower petals, dance so fine celebration of life, in all its seasons rhyme **Chorus** In the snowflakes and flower petals, we find reflection of ourselves, in natures design reminder to cherish, each moment we share symbol of hope, in the beauty thats always there The answer also includes additional facets and analyses, as follows. These additional details and rational developments are critical for the proposed approach as they provide traceable, detailed and interpretable analysis of how the answers were developed. Design principles and background **Design Principles**: - **Contrast**: Snowflakes and flower petals represent opposing seasons, creating striking contrast. - **Harmony**: Together, they create harmonious representation of natures beauty and seasonal changes. - **Evocative**: Each element evokes distinct emotions and sensations, inspiring balanced and evocative musical composition. **Material Properties**: - **Snowflakes**: - **Appearance**: Delicate, intricate, crystalline structure - **Sound**: Soft, gentle, repetitive - **Emotional Connotation**: Serene, calming, unique - **Flower Petals**: - **Appearance**: Delicate, colorful, soft - **Sound**: Light, airy, whimsical - **Emotional Connotation**: Delicate, whimsical, renewal **Hypothesis**: \"Incorporating snowflakes and flower petals in song will create harmonious representation of natures beauty and seasonal changes, evoking distinct emotions and sensations.\" **Additional Background**: To incorporate snowflakes and flower petals into song, consider using metaphors, imagery, and musical motifs to evoke the emotions and sensations associated with these natural elements. You could also explore the contrast between the two elements to create narrative that highlights the cyclical nature of life and the beauty in each season. Additionally, consider using seasonal themes and lyrics that reflect the unique characteristics of each element to create rich and evocative musical composition. While this section focuses on growing the graph iteratively, the depth of the response merits further analysis as it sheds light on the capabilities of the model. First, we note that the models approach to the musical composition task demonstrates sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities through multiple analytical layers, and capability to blend creative and analytical reasoning. For deeper analysis, let represent the models mapping function, where : Natural Elements Musical Structure. The model proposes that the primary recognition pattern can be formalized as P(α, β) = {(α x) (β x) Influences}, where α represents snowflakes and β represents flower petals. This symmetrical mapping demonstrates the models ability to identify and preserve parallel structures while maintaining essential distinctions. the models pattern recognition operated on multiple levels: L1 : Categorical We can see that Influence {Natural Phenomenon}, L2 {Mood, Natures Beauty, Seasonal Changes}. The abstraction process generated formal framework where L3 : (α x) (β x) while maintaining the essential condition α = β. This demonstrates sophisticated categorical reasoning while preserving compositional possibilities. Temporal {Winter, Spring}, and L3 : : The response reveals remarkable symmetrical structures between winter and spring phenomena, characterized by parallel relationships that can be formalized as = {(sw, sp) Phenomena Seasons}, where snowflakes (sw) 17 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR and flower petals (sp) exhibit isomorphic influence patterns. Each element maintains identical categorical relationships, with (sw, sp) Natural Phenomenon, while preserving distinct seasonal associations: sw (cid:55) Winter, sp (cid:55) Spring. The influence structure demonstrates perfect symmetry across three domains, expressible as {Mood, Natures Beauty, Seasonal Changes} : (sw x) (sp x). This symmetry manifests despite the temporal opposition of their respective seasons, suggesting fundamental balance in natures organizational structure. The relationship can be further abstracted into commutative diagram where both elements, while maintaining sw = sp, exhibit identical transformative properties: : {sw, sp} {Mood, Natures Beauty, Seasonal Changes} {0, 1}. This structural symmetry underlies the aesthetic and phenomenological balance observed in seasonal transitions. As shown in Figure 7, the responses introduce an abstract pattern framework = {α, β, δ, ϵ, ζ} where α, β represent distinct natural phenomena (α = β) that exhibit parallel transformative properties. The system is characterized by set of mappings {α, β} {δ, ϵ, ζ}, with each mapping representing direct transformative relationship. The key transformation rule (α δ) (β δ) = (δ ϵ) establishes conditional cascade effect. This creates unique convergent structure where two distinct source elements {α, β} maintain symmetric relationships with target elements while preserving their fundamental inequality. The pattern demonstrates both first-order transformations T1 : {α, β} {δ, ϵ, ζ} {0, 1} and second-order conditional transformations T2 : δ ϵ {0, 1} under specific antecedent conditions, forming hierarchical transformation framework. The model prioritized structural understanding over domain-specific musical application, evidenced by its construction of the abstract framework = {α, β, δ, ϵ, ζ} before considering musical implementation. This approach demonstrates strong logical reasoning but suggests potential limitations in capturing the temporal and emotional nuances essential to musical composition. The symmetrical framework, while mathematically elegant (x L3 : sw sp x), might benefit from additional parameters to capture the dynamic nature of musical expression. 2.5.1 Knowledge expansion growth phase An interesting aspect of the capability of our graph reasoning model is its ability to grow graphs dynamically to extract, generate and design new knowledge. To do this we iteratively task the model to generate graphs, where new prompts are developed based on earlier ones to expand the answer in new directions. Since the model produces graph at every iteration, all these graphs can ultimately be integrated into one large graph that spans diverse topics. We use the following series of prompts as visualized in Figure 8. Figures 9 and S1 present complementary visualizations of the concatenated knowledge graphs derived from the series of prompts outlined in Figure 8. Figure 9 organizes the knowledge graphs by individual prompts, emphasizing the structure and interconnections within each sub-graph. This visualization highlights the local relationships and the specific thematic focus of each prompt while illustrating how these ideas are interconnected across different sub-graphs. In contrast, Figure S1 integrates the same data into unified knowledge graph, providing holistic view of the interplay among all the prompts. By merging the sub-graphs into single structure, this representation reveals overarching connections and emergent patterns that may not be immediately apparent when examining the sub-graphs in isolation. Together, these figures offer layered perspective on the relationships within the dataset, from prompt-specific insights to system-level understanding. Figure 10 depicts the graph in more abstract representations, visualized per distinct layouts and different node properties. Data is shown in node degree, PageRank [46], and bridging coefficient displays. These are fundamental measures in network analysis, each capturing different aspects of nodes role within graph, where the analyses point to the powerful insights that can be generated based on the model output. Node degree represents the number of connections node has, providing simple yet powerful indicator of local importance; in directed graphs, this can be further divided into in-degree (incoming connections) and out-degree (outgoing connections). As an alternative, PageRank offers more global perspective, measuring nodes importance based on the significance of its neighbors. Originally developed for ranking web pages, PageRank emphasizes the quality of connections, assigning higher scores to nodes linked by other highly-ranked nodes. PageRank is measure of nodes global importance in network, originally designed to rank web pages in search engines. It assigns score to each node based on the principle that connections from important nodes contribute more to nodes rank than connections from less important nodes. The algorithm works iteratively, where nodes PageRank is proportional to the sum of the PageRank scores of its neighbors, weighted by the number of links those neighbors have. This approach captures both the quantity and quality of connections, emphasizing nodes that are linked by highly influential entities. damping factor is typically introduced to account for random jumps, ensuring the scores converge and the network can handle dangling nodes (nodes with no outgoing links). In the context of knowledge graphs, PageRank is particularly relevant for identifying the most semantically important entities or concepts. For instance, in knowledge graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships, PageRank can highlight nodes that are central to the graphs structure, such as frequently referenced concepts or pivotal entities connecting different subdomains. This can aid in prioritizing entities for tasks In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR 1. Write song by incorporating snowflakes and flower petals. 2. How do the molecular symmetry principles that create snowflake patterns influence natures beauty in other seasonal phenomena? 3. How does the cyclical pattern of seasonal changes shape human understanding of impermanence and renewal? 4. What role does nanopatterning play in flower petals? 5. Make connection between Self-Recognition and Adhesion Behavior and Magister Ludi in Hesses Glass Bead Game. 6. Make connection between Glass Beads and Nanopatterning in the context of music. 7. Propose an integration of fracture and music, considering nanopatterning. Figure 8: Logical sequential flow of prompts used to grow the knowledge graph successively through recursive reasoning. This diagram illustrates the progression of ideas, starting with creative tasks (e.g., composing song using snowflakes and flower petals) and advancing through scientific and philosophical inquiries, such as molecular symmetry, seasonal patterns, and nanopatterning. The sequence of questions can either be generated by human collaborators, or by AI. In the latter case, an infinite loop of expanding the knowledge graph can be constructed. The example prompt trajectory shown here was developed via human-AI collaboration. like question answering, reasoning, or graph traversal. Moreover, PageRank can uncover influential nodes that might serve as anchors for linking related knowledge, enhancing both the efficiency of queries and the understanding of the graphs overall topology. The bridging coefficient highlights nodes role in connecting otherwise unconnected or loosely connected regions of the graph. Nodes with high bridging coefficients serve as critical links between clusters, facilitating information flow and structural integration. Together, these metrics provide complementary insights into the structure and dynamics of complex networks. The bridging coefficient measures how well node serves as bridge between otherwise unconnected or loosely connected regions of graph, emphasizing the nodes role in maintaining structural integrity and facilitating information flow. In the context of knowledge graphs, nodes with high bridging coefficients are often critical for linking distinct clusters of knowledge, such as different domains or subgraphs. These bridging nodes play crucial role in enabling cross-domain reasoning and ensuring the graph remains well-connected. For example, in knowledge graph representing scientific research, bridging node might connect distinct areas like biology and materials science, fostering interdisciplinary insights. By identifying nodes with high bridging coefficients, one can uncover concepts or entities that act as gateways to new knowledge, prioritize areas for graph enrichment, or ensure robustness in query pathways. This measure is particularly useful for tasks like ontology alignment, where structural gaps between subdomains need to be bridged effectively. Domain prestige is measure of how accessible node is within directed graph, calculated as the fraction of all nodes that can reach given node either directly or indirectly. It captures nodes global influence by accounting for indirect paths, providing more comprehensive view of its accessibility. In the context of knowledge graphs, this measure highlights key entities that are reachable by large portion of the graph, making them central for reasoning, inference, or information propagation. Nodes with domain prestige act as crucial hubs or reference points, while nodes with 19 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 9: Visualization of the resulting integrated knowledge graph that emerges after the series of prompts delineated in Figure 8. To start, we started tasking the model to Write song by incorporating snowflakes and flower petals. The resulting graphs are organized by prompts but we show the connections that emerge between the sub-graphs. 20 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure 10: Visualization of the integrated knowledge graph created based ion the series of prompts delineated in Figure 8, starting with: Write song by incorporating snowflakes and flower petals. The data is the same as shown in Figure 9, but organized here as an integrated graph rather than by prompt, and laid out using the Fruchterman Reingold layout algorithm [47]. Panel a, node size by node degree. Panel b, node size by page rank. Panel c, node size by bridging coefficient. Panel d, node size by domain prestige (metric defined by fraction of nodes within network that are directly od indirectly pointing to it). Table 2 lists the top 5 nodes per each of these measures. low values are likely isolated or peripheral. This metric is particularly valuable for identifying entities that facilitate connectivity and play pivotal roles in the overall graph structure. Table 2 lists the top 5 nodes for each of these measures, complementing the visual representation in Figure 10 to indicate the most significant nodes in each case and metric. For alternative layouts, Figure 11 depicts various layout choices for comparison.

The underlying data is the same as shown in Figure 9, but organized here effectively via circular layout (panel a), radial axis layout (panel b), and Yifan Hu layout [48] (panel c). Color and size of each node is scaled by node degree. The layout in panel visualizes the great distance traversed in the integrated graph, providing far-ranging relationships developed by the model. 22 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR The knowledge expansion process showcased in these repeated prompts demonstrates the ability of Graph-PReFLexOR to iteratively generate and connect knowledge graphs based on series of related prompts. Beginning with creative task (writing song incorporating snowflakes and flower petals), the model progressively expands its knowledge base by addressing scientific and philosophical inquiries stemming from the initial prompt. Some unique insights/ideas generated during the recursive knowledge expansion process include: Symmetrical structures in nature: The model identifies symmetrical influence patterns between snowflakes (associated with winter) and flower petals (associated with spring). Despite their temporal opposition, both exhibit isomorphic influence on mood, natures beauty, and seasonal changes. This reveals fundamental balance in natures organization across different seasons. Abstraction of natural phenomena: The model constructs an abstract pattern framework representing the relationships between distinct natural phenomena. This framework highlights both first-order and second-order conditional transformations, demonstrating the models capacity for high-level reasoning and abstraction. Integration of diverse concepts: The knowledge graph expands to incorporate concepts like molecular symmetry principles, nanopatterning in flower petals, and the philosophical idea of impermanence and renewal, showcasing the ability to connect ideas across diverse disciplines from materials science to music to literature and philosophy [49, 50] . Emergent patterns: By visualizing the integrated knowledge graph, overarching connections and patterns emerge that might not be apparent when examining individual sub-graphs. This highlights the systems ability to synthesize knowledge and reveal hidden relationships. The knowledge expansion process exemplifies the strength of Graph-PReFLexOR in generating network of interconnected ideas, moving beyond isolated responses to build complex and evolving knowledge base. This capability holds significant potential for interdisciplinary research and exploration. 2.6 Autonomously growing knowledge garden For fully autonomous generation of graphs without human input for prompt generation, the system can be modified easily by using an LLM to develop new prompts autonomously based on previous results, to create an ever-expanding abstraction of relationships. Figure 13 shows the results of an autonomously grown knowledge graph. The upper panel shows the graph, and the lower panel depicts selection of interesting paths identified in the integrated graph. The starting prompt, the only one generated by human, was chosen to be: User task User: Discuss an interesting idea in bio-inspired materials science. The model then iterated for = 12 iterations to grow the graph. Figure 12 shows the series of prompts developed and used by the model to grow the graph (we emphasize that only the first prompt was provided by the human user). The analysis presented in Figure 14 provides comprehensive understanding of the graphs structure and dynamics. The degree distribution (Top Left) highlights the presence of scale-free topology, characterized by few highly connected hubs that dominate the graphs connectivity, alongside majority of low-degree nodes. This structure suggests robustness to random node failures but potential vulnerability to targeted attacks on the hubs. The visualization of the largest connected component (Top Right) reveals its modular nature, with densely connected subregions surrounded by sparsely connected nodes. This organization suggests hierarchical topology, where clusters are linked by intermediary nodes, enabling efficient navigation through the network. The clustering coefficient distribution (Middle Left) emphasizes the variation in local connectivity. While most nodes exhibit low clustering coefficients, indicating sparse local neighborhoods, the few nodes with high clustering coefficients are likely critical to maintaining the coherence of tightly-knit subcommunities. The betweenness centrality distribution (Middle Right) further illustrates the graphs structural dependencies. small subset of nodes exhibits significantly higher centrality, underscoring their role as key connectors that facilitate information flow between otherwise disjoint regions of the graph. These nodes act as bridges, ensuring overall network connectivity and efficiency. The shortest path length distribution (Bottom Left) demonstrates that the graph exhibits small-world characteristics, with most nodes separated by only few hops. This property enables rapid information transfer across the graph, hallmark of efficient networks in both natural and engineered systems. The community size distribution (Bottom Right) provides insights into the modular organization of the graph. Communities vary widely in size, with larger communities potentially playing dominant role in global connectivity. Central nodes within each community, annotated at the base of the bars, represent the most connected nodes within their respective communities. These nodes likely serve as local hubs, facilitating intra-community interactions and linking smaller, peripheral nodes. This analysis reveals graph that is highly efficient, modular, and robust, with clear In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR interplay between global connectivity and local structure. The presence of scale-free properties, small-world behavior, and modular organization suggests that the grown graphs topology is optimized for both stability and adaptability. In the next experiment, we prompt the model with this initial prompt, by specifically focusing the algorithm to develop new tasks at the intersection with distinct knowledge areas to foster exploration of dissimilar ideas, such as art and science (see, Materials and Methods, section ): User task User: Discuss protein design based on collagen and elastin. The algorithm develops series of prompts as shown in Figure 15, resulting in the integrated graph depicted in Figure 16. deeper analysis of the resulting graph is provided in Figure S2. We highlight one unique insight developed by the model, to relate the concept of thin places with biological materials and art. Thin places is concept drawn from various mythological and spiritual traditions, notably Celtic lore, referring to sites or moments where the boundary between the physical world and transcendent realm is perceived to be exceptionally thin or permeable. In our integrated graph, these thin places are not only connected to sitespecific, mythological art installations but also echo the conceptual blurring of boundaries integral to protein design and biomaterial engineering. Such connection is unusual because, at first glance, mythic realms and advanced biotechnology inhabit entirely distinct spheres. Yet the same drive to challenge and dissolve traditional boundaries whether between art and nature, or between synthetic and organic matterunderlies both phenomena. Consequently, the metaphor of thin places illuminates how immersive, boundary-blurring experiences in mythological art might inform innovative approaches to tissue engineering and bioluminescent biomaterials, bridging realms often seen as incompatible. This underscores the novel insight that creative, myth-inspired concepts can resonate meaningfully with the cutting edges of scientific inquiry. Naturally, the output of these reasoning steps and larger graph generated can be used for further analysis. While broader expansion is beyond the scope of this paper, we show one example here. For instance, we experimented with charging the o1 model [51] to propose new theory or concept that incorporates the results produced by GraphPReFLexOR. The results are shown in Text Box 3, showing how other reasoning models can utilize the graph reasoning output and produce concise delineation of ideas."

            "content": "This work introduced Graph-PReFLexOR, framework that integrates in-situ graph reasoning, symbolic abstraction, and recursive reflection into the generative modeling paradigm (Figures 1 and 2). By embedding graph-based intermediate representations within LLMs, Graph-PReFLexOR advances beyond the limitations of purely linguistic systems to tackle complex tasks requiring relational reasoning, multi-step deduction, and adaptive knowledge synthesis. Our experiments were designed to assess particularly how well the model could generalize, as the training data consisted of 1,000 papers on biological materials [30], whereas the tasks were constructed at the interface of science and other disciplines including design, music, and philosophy to probe the models generalization capability beyond the technical-focused training data. We find exceptional performance throughout and see that the model could very well generalize, follow the structured reasoning it learned during training (see, Figure 1), and even construct highly complex graphs that interface myriad of disciplines (see, e.g. Figure 9 and S1), and other results. particularly compelling application was the development of the knowledge garden concept, building on the ability of the model to grow knowledge graphs dynamically and iteratively, by adding new relational insights and abstractions. This resulted in series of experiments where we expanded graphs upon an initial simple task, yielding complex graph structures that themselves could be the basis of further research, inquiry and reasoning (e.g., Figures 10 and 11). Much future work can be conducted based on this method. Some initial experimentation on growing graphs autonomously yielded interesting results, such as shown in Figures 13 and 14, where we identified capability of the model to search and expand topics and connect complex ideas. By explicitly constructing and abstracting relational graphs, the Graph-PReFLexOR approach provides more structured foundation than standard sequence-oriented Transformer training. In particular, preserving connectivity among entities and relations makes it easier to detect and exploit universal features such as isomorphisms and recurrent subgraph patterns. Unlike pure next-token objectives, which largely rely on distributional cues hidden in token sequences, graph abstractions bring structural commonalities to the forefront, enabling more systematic identification of shared algebraic forms, relational templates, and higher-order symmetries. As result, symbolic rewriting and generalization become more direct, since the underlying topology is explicitly represented rather than merely inferred. Consequently, the 24 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR resulting embeddings capture deeper, domain-invariant regularities that might otherwise remain implicit or fragmentary in purely sequence-based approach. 3.1 Mathematical and Logical Framework Graph-PReFLexOR establishes pipeline of thinking and unified framework that bridges symbolic reasoning and dynamic graph-based abstraction to tackle the complexity of scientific inquiry. At its core, the framework formalizes reasoning as multi-layered mapping as introduced in equation 1 where task produces knowledge graph G, abstract patterns P, and final answers A. The knowledge graph = (V , E) encodes concepts as nodes and relationships as directed edges E, such as IS-A, RELATES-TO, and INFLUENCES. The system derives abstract patterns by identifying higher-order dependencies, structured as transformations: with proportional relationships such as: α β γ δ ϵ, α ϵ, indicating how the initial state α contributes to the final transformation ϵ. Recursive reflection as shown in Figure 5 refines these outputs iteratively, producing an optimized answer A. Inspired by category theory, Graph-PReFLexOR emphasizes relational over intrinsic properties, allowing the abstraction of domain-specific patterns into reusable, transferable frameworks. For example, graph symmetries enable translational reasoning across materials science, bioengineering, and philosophy, breaking traditional siloed boundaries. The recursive refinement process ensures these abstractions remain grounded and interpretable, aligning outputs with task-specific goals while introducing new hierarchies of understanding, specifically creating shared embedding representations with multidimensional mappings. Another key aspect of the framework lies in its iterative, knowledge-expanding capability. By incorporating feedbackdriven graph updates and dynamically integrating symbolic patterns, Graph-PReFLexOR demonstrates the potential for in-situ knowledge growth. This positions it uniquely to address challenges in hypothesis generation, interdisciplinary exploration, and adaptive learningtasks that require not just computational power but conceptual flexibility. Ultimately, Graph-PReFLexOR presents opportunities to expand the paradigm of AI-driven reasoning by fostering transparent, interpretable models of discovery, laying the groundwork for new era of autonomous scientific and creative inquiry. 3.2 Advances Over Existing Approaches Compared to traditional LLMs that rely on unstructured token-level generation, Graph-PReFLexOR introduces: Structured Intermediate Representations: Unlike models that output responses directly, Graph-PReFLexOR generates knowledge graph to explicitly represent relationships and dependencies. This improves interpretability and ensures reasoning consistency, which can be adapted easily to other scientific, technical or other domains, and formalizes shared representations. Symbolic and Connectionist Integration: While most transformer-based models do not focus specifically on symbolic reasoning capabilities, Graph-PReFLexOR bridges the gap by combining linguistic fluency with graph-based reasoning. This aligns with hybrid approaches but demonstrates superior adaptability to novel tasks. Recursive Refinement: Recursive reasoning enables multi-step improvement by iteratively refining knowledge graphs and abstract patterns. This dynamic process enhances response quality and ensures alignment with task objectives. Scalability and Adaptability: Graph-PReFLexOR extends traditional methods by dynamically expanding its knowledge graph to adapt to evolving prompts, facilitating knowledge transfer across domains. Our experimental results demonstrate that Graph-PReFLexOR outperforms baseline models in reasoning depth, knowledge transfer, and adaptability. For instance, the recursive reasoning mechanism (equation 3) achieves higher reasoning depth and adaptability compared to static methods, as we demonstrated in Table 1. For scientific applications, and special cases like mathematics, the critic function fcritic could involve specific fact-checking or consistency assessments, or even executing simulations to inject new data or physical insights. These can be incorporated during training or inference and ensure that such recursive reasoning system produces accurate and consistent results. This flexibility offers significant potential for scientific applications. 25 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR 3.3 Quantum-Inspired Metaphor for Transformers and Graph-Based Reasoning The Transformer architecture, at its core, mirrors certain fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, particularly in its representation and refinement of knowledge. While the analogy is not perfect and it is crucial to recognize that this remains metaphor and not an actual quantum mechanical process, it allows us to explore some new associations. In Transformer, before specific task or question is posed, the system exists in state analogous to quantum superposition, where all possible answers coexist as potential outcomes (Figure 17). Formally, let the systems latent state be represented as superposition of knowledge embeddings: Ψ0 = (cid:88) ckk, where each basis state corresponds to potential reasoning path or answer, and ck reflects the weight or amplitude of that path based on prior knowledge. The multi-head attention mechanism introduces form of entanglement, binding token representations through context-sensitive tensor product: Ψ = ψ1 ψ2 ψN , where tokens dynamically interact to refine the systems focus. This process can be seen as reducing the systems uncertainty, akin to minimizing entropy in quantum systems. In the case of Graph-PReFLexOR, graph-based reasoning emerges as one expression of this general quantum-like behavior. Here, the knowledge graph serves as concrete structure for representing interdependencies between concepts, evolving iteratively through recursive refinement as shown in Figure 5. Each refinement step is analogous to the application of quantum operator, governed by reasoning rules encoded in Hamiltonian: ψi+1 = ˆHψi, where ψi represents the graphs state at step i, and ˆH encodes the principles of relational optimization (e.g., maximizing coherence or minimizing contradictions). The final knowledge graph, after sufficient refinement, reflects collapsed eigenstate, optimized for the given question. Principally, this analogy extends to the entire Transformer framework. The recursive refinement within GraphPReFLexOR (e.g., Figures 1, 2 and 5) exemplifies how transformers resolve complex queries by dynamically collapsing potential answers into structured outputs through an iterative process. The abstraction mechanisms used here are just one specific instantiation of this broader capability, where relationships between nodes represent entangled dependencies that become more expressive, and accessible, through shared representations that encourage the model think in isomorphisms. In more abstract terms, the system applies interference patterns via attention weights to amplify relevant paths and suppress contradictory ones: c(i+1) = (cid:88) Akjc(i) , where Akj are attention weights that act analogously to quantum amplitudes, modulating the influence of each path. By connecting graph reasoning to these foundational quantum-like behaviors, Graph-PReFLexOR illustrates how Transformers can model tasks requiring multi-step abstraction, recursive refinement, and contextual reasoning. The graph serves as symbolic representation of the underlying quantum-inspired mechanisms, offering interpretability and structure while adhering to the general principles governing the models operation. The reasoning process can be viewed as evolving from state of superposition Ψ0 = (cid:80) ckk, where potential reasoning paths are explored. Through recursive refinement, the framework updates the reasoning state iteratively, Ri+1 = fcritic(Ri, Fi), analogous to quantum state evolution governed by external feedback Fi. The integration of reasoning paths into unified representation aligns with the mapping defined in equation 1, where task produces knowledge graph G, abstract patterns P, and final answers A. Just as the quantum system collapses into measurable eigenstate, Graph-PReFLexOR resolves these intermediate abstractions into final response: = g(RN ), providing coherent and interpretable output. Transformers are unique in developing this analogy, as unlike traditional neural networks, Transformers explicitly model relationships between inputs through their self-attention mechanism, creating dynamic superposition of weighted dependencies across all tokens in sequence. This mechanism reflects quantum superposition, where all possible relationships coexist as potentialities before being resolved. Multi-headed attention further enhances this analogy by enabling independent exploration of diverse patterns, akin to quantum entanglement, where multiple states are interdependent. Additionally, the Transformers decoding process parallels wavefunction collapse, as the model resolves probabilistic attention distributions into specific outputs. This explicit modeling of interdependencies and 26 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR dynamic evolution of representations makes Transformers inherently suited to the quantum analogy, more so than other architectures like convolutional or recurrent neural networks, which rely on static filters or sequential processing, respectively. Dense neural networks rely on fixed weight matrices to transform inputs in static, layer-by-layer manner, without explicitly capturing interdependencies between different elements of the input. Each transformation is local to the input vector as whole, akin to single deterministic operation, rather than superposition of potential relationships. Unlike transformers, dense networks do not employ mechanisms like self-attention to dynamically assign weights to input relationships, making it difficult to draw analogies to quantum phenomena such as superposition or entanglement. Furthermore, dense networks lack the iterative refinement of representations seen in transformers, where relational dependencies evolve layer by layer, mirroring quantum state evolution. While the quantum analogy offers conceptual insights, it does not literally apply to Transformers, which operate on real-valued vectors rather than complex Hilbert spaces and do not follow quantum mechanical laws such as unitarity or the Born rule. Consequently, terms like superposition, entanglement, and collapse are used figuratively, reflecting iterative reasoning rather than actual quantum processes. This can be misleading if taken literally, as Transformers remain classical computational systems. Still, these discussions give us insights into how Transformers can be viewed, and potentially improved, to better model physical processes. 3.4 Challenges and Future Opportunities Future work could focus on scaling the framework to larger datasets and more complex models, addressing challenges such as interpretability in deeply interconnected graphs. Integrating Graph-PReFLexOR with state-of-the-art architectures, such as multi-modal transformers and graph neural networks, will further expand its applicability to domains like bioinformatics, materials science, and hypothesis-driven discovery. Graph-PReFLexOR represents an advancement in reasoning frameworks, combining symbolic and connectionist paradigms. By embedding explicit graph reasoning and recursive reflection into LLMs, it sets new benchmark for scientific discovery, unlocking opportunities for transformative research across disciplines. The ability to construct structured and symbolically focused reasoning strategies within the flexible framework of LLMs is appealing as an alternative to conventional symbolic mechanisms and strategies. It also allows for the construction of powerful agentic frameworks. For instance, the approach taken in this paper demonstrated strategy to create an iterative prompting to expand knowledge graphs; this can be done via human-AI collaboration or via AI-based reasoning only. It can also incorporate specific targets, such as to expand the knowledge graph towards specific directions (e.g. introduce art, music, specific technologies, etc.) to drive discovery and mimic some mechanisms seen in directed diffusion. Other strategies may invoke more complex approaches to avoid existing known relationships to drive the model towards unexplored domains. Other aspects could involve adding retrieval-augmented assessments against literature (e.g. using Semantic Scholar) or the internet, and even include assessments of feasibility as done in other agentic frameworks that operate at the interface of AI and physics [26, 29, 52]. This helps us to expand the use of AI tools as powerful assistants to connect ideas and explore new frontiers of knowledge that were previously not accessible. Broad access to such tools is essential, especially democratization access of AI for broad audiences, as this holds key to vast unchartered knowledge. AI is no longer merely tool but partner in new creative pursuits of humans."

            "content": "We describe key materials and methods developed in this section. 4.1 Graph-PReFLexOR model development 4.1.1 Knowledge Graph Generation and Question-Answering Framework This section details the key algorithms developed for generating knowledge graph, enhancing context, and producing structured question-answering outputs during the training phase. The training dataset is the raw text of around 1,000 scientific papers, as detailed in earlier papers [30, 35]. During in-situ dataset generation during training, [36] the knowledge graph generation algorithm creates focused graph that includes key concepts and their relationships, such as classification (IS-A), influence (INFLUENCES), and connections (RELATES-TO). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is used to identify abstract patterns and dependencies, enhancing the conceptual representation, using the original dataset of raw scientific papers. As discussed in the original paper, the use of RAG is significant since it provides direct, deep and structured connection to related concepts in the training corpus to ensure full and complete reasoning paths are developed during training. The process proceeds in systematic fashion via distinct phases of construction. 27 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Question-and-Answer Generation Algorithm This algorithm synthesizes knowledge graph generation, enriched context, and question-answer generation into unified process. It produces challenging questions, detailed correct answers, and rejected answers for evaluation. An abstract representation of the workflow is as follows: 1. Retrieve randomly selected context (from all raw data) as sequence of tokens = {t1, t2, . . . , tN } from the knowledge index. = (cid:91) i=1 Text(ni). 2. Generate question based on by maximizing relevance: = argmax Relevance(q, ). 3. Enrich using RAG, yielding = + RAG(T ). Enrichment algorithms use RAG to add supplementary insights to the retrieved context, to connect specific text chunks used for generating the question with the entire dataset, ensuring that the answer and reasoning steps incorporate global perspective. 4. Construct knowledge graph from . 5. Extract reasoning steps and generate an answer as: = argmax Quality(aQ, S, G). 6. Generate rejected answer by perturbing or through direct model prompts. Details on Graph Construction: Given set of extracted concepts = {c1, c2, . . . , cn} and relationships = {r1, r2, . . . , rm}, the knowledge graph = (V , E) is constructed as: : Nodes representing the concepts C. E: Directed edges (ci, cj, rk) where rk specifies the relationship type between ci and cj. The relationship types rk are encouraged to be within set of categories (e.g., IS-A, RELATES-TO, INFLUENCES), albeit the training process may yield alternative relationship in the data. Abstract Pattern Generation Using the Generative Framework Abstract patterns are derived using RAG by identifying higher-order dependencies and summarizing them as: (C, R) (cid:88) i,j (ci, cj; rk), where quantifies the semantic strength of the relationship rk between ci and cj. Abstract patterns are constructed by analyzing hierarchical dependencies within the enriched context and summarizing key relationships into symbolic representations. The process begins with knowledge graph = (V , E), where represents concepts and defines relationships. The abstract pattern generation algorithm operates as follows: First, we identify core concepts {c1, c2, . . . , cn} from . Second, we evaluate the relevance of the relationships rk based on semantic weights: where is scoring function quantifying the significance of between concepts ci and cj. Third, we construct directed sequence of abstract states α, β, γ, δ, ϵ representing transformations, where: rk = arg max (ci, cj; r), Finally we derive proportional relationships between states, such as: α β γ δ ϵ. α ϵ, indicating the dependence of the initial state α on the final transformation ϵ. This framework synthesizes complex relationships into interpretable symbolic patterns, enabling high-level reasoning and abstraction. The above steps are conducted via repeated prompting an LLM, with RAG, to construct data in the form delineated based on raw data. 28 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR 4.1.2 Integrated Dataset Generation Algorithm Using the above steps, this algorithm creates datasets for training or evaluation by generating question-answer pairs and applying optional filtering based on specific criteria. Abstract Workflow: 1. Iterate over topics Tk or randomly sample contexts. 2. For each Tk: - Generate question Qk, correct answer Ak, and rejected answer Ak does not meet predefined correctness criteria. k. - Optionally filter pairs where 3. Formulate the dataset as: = {(Qk, Ak, k) = 1, . . . , }. 4. Apply post-processing if specified, yielding the final dataset: = P(D). The dataset generation algorithm supports training and evaluation by producing structured data that combines knowledge graph reasoning with contrastive answer evaluation. 4.1.3 Example of Resulting in-situ generated Data for Training The in-situ generated data consists of structured text representing user queries, reasoning steps, knowledge graphs, and responses. Below is snippet of the resulting data. First, the question generated is: Training data: Question What is the primary advantage of using Origami and Kirigami Engineering (OKN) for fabricating microscale 3D objects compared to traditional top-down approaches? The answer is developed first within thinking section, followed by the actual answer. The thinking sectionb begins with the generation of knowledge graph and reasoning, like so: Training data: Knowledge graph/reasoning **Knowledge Graph**: Core Concepts and Relationships: - OKN -IS-AOrigami Engineering, Kirigami Engineering - OKN -RELATES-TOMicroscale 3D Objects (Enables fabrication) - OKN -INFLUENCESTraditional Top-Down Approaches (Overcomes limitations) - OKN -RELATES-TODynamic Transitions (From 2D patterns to 3D constructs) **Reasoning Steps**: 1. OKNs enable the creation of 3D structures from 2D precursors. 2. They allow for reconfigurable structures surpassing traditional method constraints. 3. OKNs facilitate dynamic transitions and geometry changes. **Additional Background**: Origami and Kirigami Engineering enable dynamic geometry changes with unique properties, overcoming the limitations of traditional top-down approaches. The abstract pattern identified is: Training data example: Abstract pattern **Abstract Pattern:** α β γ δ ε **Key Transformation Rule:** α β: OKN enables fabrication of microscale 3D objects (β) β γ: Reconfigurability influences OKN (γ) γ δ: OKN influences traditional top-down approaches (δ) δ ε: OKN enables dynamic transitions (ε) **Essential Condition:** α ε: The more dynamic transitions ((ε)) OKN enables, the more advantageous it is for fabricating microscale 3D objects (α) Pattern Context: The primary advantage of using Origami and Kirigami Engineering (OKN) for fabricating microscale 3D objects is their ability to create highly reconfigurable structures with diverse properties, overcoming the limitations of traditional top-down approaches. This reconfigurability allows for dynamic transitions from 2D patterns to 3D constructs, enabling large and reversible geometry changes, which are essential for applications requiring adaptability and multifunctionality. [...] As an interpretation, the model identifies that the effectiveness of OKN in fabricating microscale 3D objects (α) is directly proportional to its capability to enable dynamic transitions (ε). 29 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR The final response after <thinking>..</thinking> section is: Training data: Final answer The primary advantage of using Origami and Kirigami Engineering (OKN) for fabricating microscale 3D objects compared to traditional top-down approaches lies in their ability to create highly reconfigurable structures with wide range of properties. Heres breakdown of this advantage: 1. Overcoming traditional limitations: OKNs allow for the design of materials with limitless variety of patterns and composites, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that are constrained by factors such as miscibility, compatibility, and temperature stability. This versatility enables the creation of microscale 3D objects with tailored properties for specific applications. 2. Dynamic transitions: Unlike static metamaterials, OKNs offer dynamic transitions from two-dimensional patterns to three-dimensional constructs. This enables large and reversible geometry changes, allowing for adaptability and multifunctionality in the resulting microscale 3D objects. 3. Unique property combinations: OKNs facilitate the engineering of materials with unique combinations of properties that are typically contradictory. For example, OKN structures can exhibit high conductivity and stretchability simultaneously, which is challenging to achieve with traditional methods. This enables the creation of microscale 3D objects with unprecedented functionalities. 4. Macroscopic deformability: OKNs provide macroscopic deformability far beyond the strain limits of the constituent materials. This allows for programmable and complex responses to strain, making them particularly suitable for applications requiring adaptability and multifunctionality. For instance, OKN-based biomedical devices can conform to the shape of organs or tissues, reducing tissue damage and improving integration. 5. Predictability and reproducibility: OKN structures can be manufactured using established additive or subtractive techniques, such as lithography or laser cutting. This ensures predictability and reproducibility in their mechanical, optical, and electrical properties, making them reliable for various applications. This snippet illustrates how the generated data combines user input, structured reasoning, knowledge graph insights, and comprehensive response to create cohesive dataset for downstream tasks. Figure 18 shows more detailed analysis of the graph generated for this training sample, as well as visual analysis of the overall answer. The system effectively translates user queries into structured reasoning steps and detailed responses, leveraging the knowledge graph to identify and elaborate on key relationships and insights. The abstract pattern captures the hierarchical influence of OKN principles, emphasizing dynamic transitions as pivotal advantage. The inclusion of dynamic transitions and unique property combinations highlights the capability of the system to synthesize complex ideas. Finally, the response integrates theoretical concepts with practical applications, ensuring relevance and depth. 4.1.4 Training strategy The training strategy is identical as described in [36], using variant of ORPO [53] and DPO, specifically the EXO variant [54, 44]. 4.2 Recursive reasoning implementation We delineate details and prompts used in the recursive reasoning implementation visualized in Figure 5. The GraphPRefLexOR recursive reasoning algorithm iteratively refines graph representations of relational mechanics using multi-agent system with Agent #1 being the Graph Reasoning model, and Agent #2 being the non fine-tuned meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model. This prompt is used for Agent #2 to critique the thought process generated in the past round, generated by Agent #1: Critic prompting strategy will show you question and thought process. Your task is to critique the thought process and provide suggestions to improve it to better answer the question in logical, well-reasoned manner. Question: {question} Thought process: {think} Provide feedback and suggestions for how to improve the thought process, and nothing else. The feedback is: The prompt to improve the previous thinking section is as follows: Improvement prompting strategy will show you thought process and feedback. Carefully implement the feedback and improve the thought process by addressing all suggestions, but keep the overall structure the same. Thought process: {think} Feedback: {reflect} Provide the improved thought process, and nothing else. The revised thought process is: This prompt is used to integrate earlier responses into an integrated, final answer. 30 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Integration prompting strategy will show you question and several possible answers. QUESTION: {question} ANSWER #0: {answer_0} ANSWER #1: {answer_1} ... Carefully incorporate all ideas presented in the answer candidates into very detailed, final answer. Do not repeat the question. You directly begin your response with the final answer to the question. The answer is: 4.3 Knowledge garden prompting strategy through agentic modeling Below is an example of how the knowledge graph is expanded by providing the set of earlier graph structures (graph_str) and asking another LLM agent to develop new question, to which Graph-PReFLexOR then responds, then generating new graph. Since the prompt includes the earlier keywords/nodes as instructed in the prompt, the algorithm results in well-connected graph that expands in new directions. The prompt can be constructed in particular ways to emphasize certain aspects. For this example, we seek to create multi-disciplinary outputs, especially at the interface with art. Prompting strategy to develop new questions to grow the knowledge garden Consider this list of topics/keywords. Formulate concise follow-up creative and highly unusual question to ask about related but totally different concept. Your question should include at least one of the original topics/keywords marked as ... but expand to new dissimilar fields such as philosophy or art. Original list of topics/keywords: {graph_str} The new question is: The resulting new question, with an example shown in Figure 15 for this particular prompt. 4.4 Graph visualization We use mermaid.js to visualize graphs, where the output of the graph reasoning model is converted to the scripting language using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, then exported using the web editor (https://mermaid.live/). Additional visualizations and analyses are conducted using Gephi [55] (https://gephi.org/) and various plugins therein. 4.5 Glossary and key terms Table 3 shows summary of key terms and definitions used in this paper.

Mytho-Luminal Liminality We propose novel theoretical framework, Mytho-Luminal Liminality, uniting the mythological concept of thin places with the boundary-blurring practices of protein design and biomaterial engineering. In Celtic lore and related traditions, thin place is defined as domain where seemingly incompatible worldsthe mundane and the transcendentintersect. Formally, if we let be the set of all conceptual or physical boundary domains, then: (x D) : ThinPlaces(x) BioTech(x) ChallengingUnderstandingBoundaries(x) = MythoLuminalLiminality(x). Here, ThinPlaces(x) indicates that manifests mythic boundary principle (e.g., the veil between worlds), BioTech(x) signals that leverages biological processes or protein engineering, and ChallengingUnderstandingBoundaries(x) specifies an active blurring of traditional categories (art vs. science, natural vs. synthetic). Whenever these conditions co-occur, we claim that exemplifies Mytho-Luminal Liminality, state in which mythic transcendence intersects with engineered materials to evoke new modes of perception. In practice, this framework urges us to create immersive, site-specific installations using real proteinssuch as Elastin-Like Proteins or Collagenous Proteinscoupled with bioluminescent or ephemeral components, so that visitors experience the sensation of stepping into boundary realm reminiscent of folkloric thin places. Indeed, the same conceptual impulse that once inspired ancient myths to describe liminal passageways (between mortal and otherworldly planes) can now inform tissue engineering and protein design, bridging the gap between organic and synthetic, living and manufactured. By intentionally integrating artwork referencing Ancient Mythologies or harnessing luminescent biomaterials in ways that challenge our understanding of boundaries, we highlight the spiritual awe inherent in the process of creating living installations. Below is simple TikZ sketch illustrating how mythic boundary perspective (thin places) merges with biotechnological context to yield novel immersive experiences: Mythic Boundary (Thin Places) Challenging Understanding Boundaries Protein Design & Tissue Eng. Mytho-Luminal Liminality (Installations) This diagram suggests that thin places, though mythic, can motivate new creative efforts in synthetic biology, while Challenging Understanding Boundaries provides conceptual conduit that connects folklore-inspired liminality to biomaterial research. By embedding Elastin-Like Proteins or Collagen Tripeptides in immersive artworks, one effectively fashions domain where the physical and the transcendent meet, thus triggering the awe and disorientation characteristic of thin places. This theoretical approachMythoLuminal Liminalityoffers hitherto unexplored avenue for transdisciplinary collaboration: artistry in living materials that is at once rooted in ancient mythic boundary concepts, yet forward-looking in its deployment of cutting-edge biotechnology. Within the broader schema of Mytho-Luminal Liminality, our knowledge graph highlights that highly specific molecular elementssuch as Collagen Tripeptide (Gly-X-Y) and Tensinrelate to one another en route to Protein Design, an entity itself classified as Biological Molecule. From philosophical vantage, this chain suggests that the structural elegance of protein segments (e.g., the repeating Gly-X-Y motif) can be approached as modern instantiation of boundary-challenging principles. Indeed, just as thin place blurs the division between spiritual and mundane, so too does Protein Design blur the line between naturally occurring and engineered molecular architectures. Further underscoring this parallel, our graph shows that Molecular Modeling (an IS-A Computational Technique) directly relates to both Collagen and Elastin, reinforcing the idea that an interplay of artistic imagination and technical rigor underlies the creation of new protein scaffolds. Philosophically, this implies that challenging our understanding of boundarieswhich, in mythic contexts, manifests as thin placecan also guide transformative science in tissue engineering and biomaterial innovation. By weaving mythic insights into protein design thinking, one treats the protein-folding arena as liminal space where computational, biological, and even artistic considerations converge to yield novel forms that feel as uncanny and awe-inspiring as an ancient threshold between worlds. 46 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR"

The answer does not contain any reasoning steps, graphs or abstract patterns. Answer of the non-fine tuned model **Designing Novel Protein-Based Material Inspired by Snowflake and Ant Behavior** **Introduction** Nature has inspired numerous innovative materials and technologies, from biomimetic surfaces to self-healing materials. This project aims to integrate the unique properties of snowflakes and ants to design new, tough protein-based material. By studying the intricate structures and behaviors of snowflakes and ants, we can develop material that combines exceptional strength, durability, and adaptability. **Snowflake-Inspired Structure** Snowflakes exhibit hexagonal lattice structure, which provides exceptional strength and stability. This structure can be replicated in protein-based material by using combination of amino acids and peptides to create repeating pattern of hexagonal units. **Ant-Inspired Behavior** Ants are known for their remarkable ability to adapt to changing environments and withstand extreme conditions. They achieve this through their unique behavior, which involves: 1. **Self-organization**: Ants organize themselves into complex social structures, allowing them to respond to changing conditions. 2. **Adaptive camouflage**: Ants can change their color and texture to blend in with their surroundings, making them nearly invisible. 3. **Self-healing**: Ants can repair damaged tissues and restore their colonys integrity. **Designing the Protein-Based Material** To create material inspired by snowflakes and ants, we can combine the following components: 1. **Protein scaffold**: protein-based scaffold will provide the structural framework for the material. This can be achieved using combination of collagen, elastin, and keratin. 2. **Hexagonal lattice**: The protein scaffold will be arranged in hexagonal lattice structure, inspired by snowflakes. This will provide exceptional strength and stability. 3. **Ant-inspired behavior**: The material will be designed to exhibit self-organization, adaptive camouflage, and self-healing properties. This can be achieved through the use of: * **Microscopic particles**: The material will contain microscopic particles that can change their color and texture to blend in with their surroundings. * **Self-healing peptides**: The material will contain peptides that can repair damaged tissues and restore its integrity. 4. **Biocompatibility**: The material will be designed to be biocompatible, ensuring that it can be safely integrated into living tissues. **Prototype Development** To develop prototype of this material, we can use combination of 3D printing and bioprinting techniques. The protein scaffold will be created using 3D printer, and the hexagonal lattice structure will be achieved through the use of specialized mold. **Testing and Evaluation** The material will be tested for its mechanical properties, including tensile strength, compressive strength, and impact resistance. Additionally, the materials self-organization, adaptive camouflage, and self-healing properties will be evaluated through series of experiments. **Potential Applications** The protein-based material inspired by snowflakes and ants has numerous potential applications, including: 1. **Biomedical devices**: The material could be used to create implantable devices, such as bone grafts or tissue engineering scaffolds. 2. **Textiles**: The material could be used to create durable, self-healing textiles for clothing and upholstery. 3. **Construction materials**: The material could be used to create self-healing concrete or other construction materials. **Conclusion** The design of novel protein-based material inspired by snowflakes and ants represents significant breakthrough in biomimetic materials science. By combining the unique properties of snowflakes and ants, we can create material that combines exceptional strength, durability, and adaptability. This material has numerous potential applications in biomedical devices, textiles, and construction materials, and could revolutionize the way we design and engineer materials. 48 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure S1: Visualization of the integrated knowledge graph created based ion the series of prompts delineated in Figure 8 (model was tasked: Write song by incorporating snowflakes and flower petals.). The data is the same as shown in Figure 9, but organized here effectively as an integrated graph rather than by prompt. 49 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure S2: Visualization of the graph analysis of the autonomously grown graph depicted in Figure 16. (Top Left) Degree distribution shows heterogeneous structure with prominent hubs and many low-degree nodes. (Top Right) Visualization of the largest connected component reveals its modular structure. (Middle Left) Clustering coefficient distribution highlights sparse local connectivity, with some nodes in dense clusters. (Middle Right) Betweenness centrality distribution indicates small subset of critical nodes facilitating connectivity. (Bottom Left) Shortest path length distribution suggests small-world structure with most nodes separated by few hops. (Bottom Right) Community size distribution, with central nodes labeled, reflects varying sizes and roles within the graph. The analysis collectively underscores the complex topology of the graph, including heterogeneity, modularity, and small-world characteristics. 50 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR S1 Example: Mapping two distinct, but isomorphic graphs into shared representation For sake of the demonstration, we have two distinct graphs that represent the equations: G1 : = a, G2 : = R, where G1 and G2 are defined as detailed below: Graph Structures: Graph G1: Nodes: , m, a, =, Edges: = , = , m, a, , Graph G2: Nodes: , I, R, =, Edges: = , = , I, R, , Initial Embeddings: The nodes in G1 and G2 are assigned distinct two-dimensional embeddings to reflect their unique roles in the equations. The initial embeddings, chosen randomly here, are referred to as iteration 0 in Table S1. Of course, embeddings in LLM are much higher-dimensional but the 2D illustration allows us to exemplify the approach more easily. In the scope of LLM, the initial embeddings would reflect how tokens are mapped into the embedding space via the embedding layer from which on they are processed further. Table S1: Distinct 2D embeddings (iteration 0) for each variable in G1 and G2. the variables , m, a, , and have different embeddings as they would in LLM, since each token is assigned unique embedding. The embeddings for = and are identical in both cases, as they would be in LLM since the same tokens are mapped to the same vector. Node Graph Initial Embedding = = G1 G1 G1 G1 G1 G2 G2 G2 G2 G2 (0.7, 0.3) (0.6, 0.9) (0.1, 0.9) (1.2, 0.5) (0.8, 0.6) (0.2, 0.9) (0.05, 0.8) (0.9, 0.1) (1.2, 0.5) (0.8, 0.6) Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) Update Mechanism: For details on GIN models, we refer readers to other literature [56, 13]. For the demonstration here we assume we have small MLP with nonlinear activations (ReLU) in our GIN update: h(k+1) = MLP(cid:0)(1 + ϵ) h(k) + (cid:88) h(k) (cid:1), uN (v) where (v) are the neighbors of v, and MLP(x) = σ(cid:0)WL σ(WL1 . . . σ(W2 σ(W1x + b1) + b2) + bL1) + bL (cid:1). Weights/biases (W1, W2, . . . b1, b2, . . . ) are learnable parameters optimized during training of the model. Final Embeddings After One Iteration For the sake of the demonstration, we identified particular set of weights and biases such that the embeddings of the distinct variables are mapped into the same representation by the GIN operation. Hence, after one iteration of summation and MLP, the updated embeddings h(1) are shown in Table S2. 51 In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Table S2: Iteration 1 embeddings after the GIN update with nonlinear MLP. Notice that the embeddings for G1 and G2 are now aligned, respecting the functional equivalence of their structures. See Figure S3 for plot. Node Graph h(1) (Comments) = = G1 G1 G1 G1 G1 G2 G2 G2 G2 (0.58, 0.81) Matches =(1) in G2 (0.96, 0.29) Matches (1) in G2 (0.39, 0.92) Matches (1) in G2 (0.70, 0.72) Matches (1) in G2 (0.68, 0.73) Matches R(1) in G2 (0.58, 0.81) Matches =(1) in G1 (0.96, 0.29) Matches (1) in G1 (0.39, 0.92) Matches (1) in G1 (0.70, 0.72) Matches m(1) in G1 (0.68, 0.73) Matches a(1) in G1 Discussion This example demonstrates the power of GINs in mapping distinct concepts into shared representation, forming one example of how abstraction can be achieved. Despite the graphs G1 and G2 starting with distinct initial embeddings and different structures, the GIN successfully aligned their embeddings after one iteration. This alignment reflects the structural equivalence of the graphs: isomorphic graphs with equivalent structures = aligned embeddings. Thus, the equations = and = share the same functional relationships (output = parameter input), leading to aligned embeddings despite differing physical meanings. It confirms that after processing by the GIN, the two isomorphic graphs have the same node embeddings and graph-level embeddings. Figure S3 depicts visualization of the transformation, including the graphs and how their embeddings adapt after one layer of GIN. The argument with relation to Graph-PReFLexOR is that rather than developing training objective to model isomorphic mappings explicitly, we model these transformations explicitly by mapping task into graph representation, then symbolic abstraction, and then to the final answer, as shown in Figure 1. In this visualization, the bottom part of the image particularly shows how problems are expressed in shared tokenization form to yield effectively similar result as visualized in Figure S3. This reflects mapping into abstraction for generalization and back, achieving mulitple goals simultaneously. In situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR Figure S3: Visualization of transformation of two isomorphic graphs, each representing an equation (F = and = (top), into an identical representation (bottom). As one can see, after the transformation of node embeddings by GIN, the nodes of both graphs collapse on the same embeddings are are indistinguishable, to yield generalized representation (akin to the concept described in Figure 1, bottom). The two graphs not only have the same node embeddings but also the same graph-level embeddings, revealing that they are isomorphic."
