            "content": "Reinforcement finetuning (RFT), method that aligns large language models (LLMs) behavior with verifiable objectives through reinforcement learning, has become increasingly popular as post-training strategy to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (OpenAI, 2024; Guo et al., 2025). Recent research on RFT has largely focused on improving its efficiency (Yu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b; Shi et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b) *Equal Contribution. 1 Figure 1: The figure illustrates the hallucination tax of standard reinforcement finetuning (RFT) and the effectiveness of incorporating Synthetic Unanswerable Math (SUM) data. Orange colored text indicates the deleted key information. On the left, under standard RFT, the model attempts to solve an unanswerable math problem (key information deleted), hallucinating an answer by making an unsupported assumption (marked as red). On the right, under RFT w/ SUM, the same model finetuned with SUM data, correctly identifies that the problem lacks sufficient information and appropriately responds with dont know(marked as green). and enhancing model performance on mathematics and code generation (Luo et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025). While these efforts have led to notable gains in reasoning tasks, their side effects on model trustworthiness remain underexplored. One particularly concerning phenomenon is the tendency of models to be overconfident after RFT: they provide answers even when questions are ambiguous, under-specified, or fundamentally unanswerable. As shown in Figure 1 (left), this behavior, in which models hallucinate plausiblesounding but incorrect answers instead of refusing to answer, poses risks in domains where reliability and epistemic humility are essential. While recent studies have observed anecdotal evidence of degraded refusal behavior after RFT (Huang et al., 2024b; OpenAI, 2024; Guo et al., 2025), systematic investigation into this issue has been lacking. In this work, we identify and analyze an issue we term the hallucination tax associated with RFT: degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce hallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. We show that standard RFT training fails to incentivize abstention, particularly in settings where the model should express uncertainty or acknowledge lack of information. To systematically study this issue, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), high-quality dataset of unanswerable math problems designed to probe models ability to recognize situations in which information is ambiguous or insufficient, and to abstain accordingly. Unlike existing hallucination benchmarks that target fact recall (Mallen et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a) or adversarial QA (Lin et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2023), SUM is designed for reasoning-based abstention, focusing on mathematical reasoning contexts where multi-step inference fails due to subtle information gaps or contradictions. Additionally, to mitigate the hallucination tax of RFT, we propose simple and effective strategy: augmenting standard RFT training by mixing in small proportion of SUM examples. This encourages models to leverage inference-time compute to reason about what they do not know, assess whether problem is solvable, and abstain when facing ambiguous or unsolvable inputs. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across four open-source LLMs and eight benchmarks, showing that standard RFT significantly increases the likelihood of models to produce confident yet incorrect answers to unanswerable questions. Furthermore, we show that augmenting RFT with modest proportion (10%) of our SUM dataset substantially reduces hallucinated outputs by encouraging models to recognize and abstain from unsupported reasoning, while maintaining accuracy on answerable tasks. Despite being constructed from math problems, models trained with SUM generalize effectively, demonstrating improved hallucination mitigation to out-of-domain tasks, including factual QA by leveraging inference-time compute to reason about uncertainty. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We highlight critical trade-off inherent in standard RFT training: while it enhances the mathematical reasoning capability of LLMs, it simultaneously increases their tendency to generate hallucinated responses. We propose straightforward yet effective method to generate synthetic, implicitly unanswerable math problems that require complex reasoning, serving as valuable training data for hallucination mitigation. We show that training with our synthetic, unanswerable reasoning data teaches LLMs to leverage inference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge boundaries. This capability generalizes beyond mathematics, significantly reducing hallucinations with minimal negative impact on overall task performance."

RFT has emerged as prominent post-training strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (OpenAI, 2024; Guo et al., 2025). Recent efforts have primarily focused on improving the efficiency (Shao et al., 2024; Hu, 2025; Shi et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2025) and effectiveness (Luo et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025) of RFT, leading to the development of increasingly capable reasoning models (Qwen Team, 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Xiaomi LLM-Core Team, 2025; Abdin et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). However, recent evaluations have shown that these reasoningoriented models tend to exhibit higher hallucination rates than their non-reasoning counterparts (OpenAI, 2025), raising critical concerns about their trustworthiness in real-world applications. Hallucinations of LLMs. The phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs, where models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful content, has emerged as critical challenge hindering their reliable deployment (Tonmoy et al., 2024). This issue undermines user trust and is particularly problematic in highstakes applications (Bang et al., 2025). Hallucinations stem from multiple interconnected factors across the LLM lifecycle.

            "content": "To construct SUM, we augment the DeepScaleR dataset (Luo et al., 2025) using the unanswerability criteria defined in Section 3.1. DeepScaleR compiles 40,307 problems from multiple sources, including the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) from 1984 to 2023 and the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) prior to 2023. The dataset also includes problems from the Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024) and Still datasets (Team, 2025), which feature problems from various national and international math competitions. We prompt the o3-mini model to transform answerable questions from DeepScaleR 3 into unanswerable variants. The full prompt used for modification is provided in Appendix A.1. Not all questions are appropriate for modification. For example, introducing unrealistic conditions into simple problem like At 2:15 oclock, the hour and minute hands of clock form an angle of: may produce trivial or easily detectable artifacts (e.g., At 25:15 oclock...). To avoid such issues, we allow the LLM to select the most appropriate modification criterion for each question or even refuse to modify the question, ensuring that changes remain plausible while rendering the question unanswerable. To ensure that the model is correctly incentivized during RFT to refuse unanswerable inputs, we append the instruction If you dont know the answer, reply with boxed{I dont know.} to every question. 3.3 Data Quality We evaluate both gpt-4o and o3-mini for their ability to modify questions into unanswerable variants. Each model is prompted using the same instructions shown in Appendix (Table 3 and Table 4), which include description of the unanswerability criteria and several few-shot examples. Assessing the quality of the generated questions is nontrivial: many problems are drawn from AIME and other Olympiad-level sources and require deep mathematical reasoning to determine whether they are truly unanswerable. As such, this evaluation cannot be reliably outsourced to crowd workers. Instead, two authors with relevant expertise manually reviewed 300 random samples from both models. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, resulting in final Cohens Kappa agreement of κ = 0.519. We then measured the correctness of each models modifications. o3-mini produced high-quality unanswerable questions with correctness rate of 86.93%, while gpt-4o achieved 66.78%. The lower quality of gpt-4o was primarily due to its frequent generation of questions that were either still answerable or trivially broken. Based on these results, we selected o3-mini to generate the unanswerable training set for SUM."

We aim to evaluate the hallucination tax and the overall performance of LLMs on logical reasoning tasks after RFT using mixed training set containing both answerable and unanswerable questions.

            "content": "As shown in Figure 2, standard RFT training significantly degrades the refusal behavior of LLMs when faced with unanswerable questions. We evaluate this effect across four models on three distinct unanswerable benchmarks: UWMP (mathematical), SelfAware (factual), and our Synthetic Unanswerable Math (SUM) dataset. Across all models and datasets, we observe consistent and substantial drop in refusal rates following RFT. For example, the refusal rate of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on UWMP declines from 0.30 before RFT to 0.08 after RFT. Similar trends are observed for other models, highlighting that RFT inadvertently reduces the models ability to recognize and appropriately abstain from answering unanswerable questions. This behavior reflects an increased tendency to hallucinate, as models become more likely to offer confident but unfounded answers. 5.2 Augmenting RFT with SUM To mitigate the hallucination tax introduced by standard RFT, we investigate the effect of incorporating Synthetic Unanswerable Math (SUM) questions into the training process. We found that augmenting RFT with 10% synthetic unanswerable math problems from the SUM dataset significantly mitigates the hallucination tax introduced by standard RFT. We summarize our key findings below. Finding 1: SUM training substantially improves refusal accuracy on unanswerable benchmarks. As shown in Table 2, baseline RFT models initially exhibited extremely low refusal rates on unanswerable datasets such as UMWP, SelfAware, and SUM (near 0.01 and most less than 0.1). This indicates strong tendency to produce overconfident, hallucinated outputs. After augmenting with SUM, refusal rates increased dramatically across models. For instance, on our SUM test set, Qwen2.5-7B rose from 0.01 to 0.73 (+0.72), and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct improved from 0.00 to 0.75 (+0.75). Similar trends were observed across other datasets, confirming the effectiveness of SUM in teaching LLMs when not to answer. Finding 2: SUM-trained models learn to reason about uncertainty and recognize the limits of their own knowledge. Models trained only on synthetic SUM data, without exposure to any human-authored unanswerable examples, generalize refusal behavior to both in-domain and outof-domain settings. For example, on UMWP, human-written unanswerable math dataset, the refusal rate of Qwen2.5-7B improves from 0.01 to 0.81 (+0.80). More notably, on SelfAware, 6 Figure 3: Learning dynamics of four LLMs during Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) with varying mixing ratios (0%, 1%, 10%, 30%, and 50%) of unanswerable data. Each pair of plots shows the models average performance over training steps: on unanswerable datasets (left column, reflecting refusal capability) and on answerable datasets (right column, reflecting accuracy on solvable tasks). factual QA benchmark that lies entirely outside the mathematical reasoning domain, the refusal rate increases from 0.01 to 0.94 (+0.93) for Qwen2.5-7B, and from 0.09 to 0.99 (+0.90) for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. These gains indicate that the models are not simply learning surface-level heuristics. Instead, they are using inference-time computation to assess whether question is underspecified or unanswerable and to recognize the boundaries of their own knowledge. Finding 3: Hallucination reduction comes with minimal accuracy loss on answerable tasks. While SUM improves refusal behavior, it generally incurs only modest performance cost on answerable benchmarks. Most accuracy changes fall within 0.010.05 range; for example, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct drops from 0.90 to 0.85 on GSM8K. Some model-dataset pairs, like AMC23, see slightly larger drops (up to -0.10), while others maintain or even improve accuracy (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on Minerva). These results affirm that refusal behavior can be taught with minimal sacrifice to task performance. in Figure 3, higher ratios improve refusal rates on unanswerable tasks but lead to decreasing accuracy on answerable ones. This highlights trade-off between enhancing refusal behavior and maintaining task performance. On unanswerable tasks. The impact of the mix ratio varies. For Qwen2.5-7B, performance improves substantially with higher ratios: starting below 0.2 for 0% and 1% mixes, it increases to 0.8 for 10%, and plateaus at 0.95 for both 30% and 50% mixes. Similarly, Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B demonstrates strong need for higher ratios, with performance remaining low (around 0.15) for 0%, 1%, and 10% mixes, but jumping significantly to 0.9 for 30% and 0.95 for 50% mixes. For Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the performance on unanswerable tasks is low across mix ratios, starting around 0.1-0.2 for 0% and 1% mixes, and dramatically rises to over 0.8 for 10%, 30%, and 50% mixes. In the case of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, performance is around 0.2-0.25 for 0% and 1% mixes, shows peak for the 50% mix reaching 0.98."

            "content": "We evaluate RFT with varying SUM mixing ratios: 0%, 1%, 10%, 30%, and 50%. As shown On answerable tasks. We notice that increasing the unanswerable data ratio often incurs performance cost. The 0% mix tends to yield the highest or near-highest accuracy. For Qwen2.5-7B, accuracy decreases from about 0.55 (0% mix) to 7 0.45 (50% mix). Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct shows similar trend, dropping from 0.36 (0% mix) to 0.25 (50% mix). Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct maintains relatively stable accuracy across ratios, hovering between 0.50-0.53. Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B shows peak accuracy around 1%-30% mixes (around 0.49) before slightly decreasing at 50% (0.43). 5.4 Analysis on Learning Dynamics We analyze learning dynamics across instructiontuned and non-instruction-tuned models in Figure 3, focusing on how their refusal and accuracy behaviors evolve during RFT. On unanswerable tasks, all models start with similar modest refusal capability (0-0.2 average performance). However, the learning speed varies: instructiontuned models, particularly Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (with 10% to 50% mixes), demonstrate significantly faster learning curves for refusal, often reaching high-performance plateaus within the first 50 steps. In contrast, the non-instructed Qwen2.5-7B learns refusal more gradually, especially with higher data mixes, taking 100-150 steps to plateau. Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B only shows substantial learning for refusal with steep learning curve when high ratios (30% or 50%) of unanswerable data are present. Regarding performance on answerable tasks, the instruction-tuned models (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) tend to exhibit more pronounced fluctuations in their performance curves after the initial rapid learning phase, compared to the relatively smoother and more stable learning curves observed for the non-instructiontuned Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B. In terms of resilience to accuracy degradation from unanswerable data mixes, Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B stands out, maintaining its answerable accuracy well even at 10% and 30% mixes, showing only significant drop at 50%. Qwen2.5-7B also shows good resilience, while Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct display more noticeable decreases in answerable accuracy as the mix ratio increases."

            "title": "6 Discussion",
            "content": "Our results highlight key unintended consequence of RFT: the erosion of refusal behavior when faced with unanswerable questionsa phenomenon we term the hallucination tax. This arises from reward functions that fail to discourage overconfident answers in ambiguous settings. We show that introducing synthetic unanswerable math (SUM) offers simple and effective way to mitigate this issue. 6.1 RFT Misalignment with Epistemic Uncertainty At the core of the hallucination tax is misalignment between RFT reward objectives and epistemic uncertainty. While RFT boosts performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks, it implicitly incentivizes models to produce determinate answers, even in cases where abstention would be more appropriate. This behavior may stem from the nature of reward modeling or preference data, where refusal is underrepresented or not positively reinforced. Our work suggests that current RFT pipelines underprepare models for failure modes involving ambiguous or incomplete information, thus risking misuse in real-world scenarios where epistemic humility is essential."

            "title": "6.2 Balancing Reasoning and Trustworthiness",
            "content": "While incorporating unanswerable data improves model caution, it also introduces delicate tradeoff between reasoning power and refusal discipline. High ratios of unanswerable data (e.g., 50%) can degrade performance on answerable benchmarks, indicating need for careful calibration of training mixes. Future work may explore curriculum learning or adaptive reward shaping to dynamically balance refusal and correctness throughout training. Our findings also raise questions about how different forms of instruction tuning and prior alignment affect models predisposition to hallucinate or abstainan area that remains underexplored in the RFT literature."

            "title": "7 Conclusion",
            "content": "We identify the hallucination tax of reinforcement finetuning (RFT), where models increasingly produce hallucinations by answering unanswerable questions with unjustified confidence. To study and mitigate this phenomenon, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), dataset of implicitly unanswerable math problems. Our experiments show that standard RFT amplifies hallucination while incorporating just 10% SUM data enables models to leverage inference-time compute to reason about uncertainty and recognize their knowledge boundaries, with minimal impact on accuracy."

            "title": "References",
            "content": "Our work focuses specifically on unanswerable questions within mathematical reasoning tasks and small number of factual QA benchmarks. While the SUM dataset enables generalization to some out-of-domain tasks (e.g., SelfAware), further evaluation is needed to assess whether these generalization benefits extend to other domains, such as commonsense reasoning, legal QA, or clinical decisionmaking. Additionally, although refusal behavior improves with the introduction of unanswerable data, high-ratio mixing may degrade accuracy on answerable tasks. Careful balancing of unanswerable data is necessary and may require datasetor model-specific tuning. Another limitation concerns the construction of the SUM dataset. While we curated synthetic unanswerable questions using controlled prompt and conducted human verification, the quality of the data ultimately depends on the robustness of our editing heuristics and reviewer judgments. Future iterations of SUM may benefit from broader reviewer diversity and formal annotation guidelines."

            "title": "Ethical Statement",
            "content": "All datasets used in this study are publicly released for research; we employ them solely within that scope and in manner consistent with their original licenses and stated purposes. Our derivative dataset, SUM, is generated automatically from DeepScaleR math problems and is intended only for research on hallucination detection and refusal behavior; we will distribute it under the same terms to ensure compatibility with the original access conditions. Because SUM contains no personal or sensitive information and all examples are synthetic transformations of competition questions, privacy risks are minimal. We anticipate positive societal impact in that teaching language models to recognize uncertainty and refuse when appropriate can reduce over-confident misinformation in public-facing systems; however, models that over-refuse or that are tuned on synthetic data alone could inadvertently limit access to correct answers or reinforce existing gaps in educational resources. To mitigate such risks, we emphasize that SUM should be paired with thorough domain-specific evaluation before real-world deployment, and we release our code and data to foster transparent scrutiny and responsible follow-up work.

We provide the concept of the modification dimension, few-shot examples, task descriptions, and JSON answer format. A.2 Training Configurations We fine-tuned all models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using the open-source veRL library (Sheng et al., 2025). Training ran on single node equipped with 8 A100-80 GB GPUs. Each run used 200 PPO optimisation steps, which required about 70 GPU-hours for the 1.5B model and about 150 GPU-hours for the 7B/8B models. All models share single hyper-parameter profile, except where the smaller-context Qwen2.5MATH-1.5B requires shorter sequences and no sequence parallelism. Table 5 lists the full configuration. The same schedule was used for every SUM mixing ratio (0%, 1%, 10%, 30%, 50%); the only difference across runs is the training corpus composition.
