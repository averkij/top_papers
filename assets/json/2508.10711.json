Introduction The remarkable success of autoregressive models in large language models (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2025a; Radford et al., 2018, 2019) has motivated their extension to text-to-image generation. By unifying multimodal inputs into single sequence, autoregressive image generation models (Chen et al., 2025b; Fan et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023, 2024b,c; Wang et al., 2024b; Yu et al., 2022) offer scalable and flexible approach to text-to-image generation that naturally accommodates diverse conditioning signals. However, most existing autoregressive approaches for text-to-image generation (Chen et al., 2025b; Dong et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024a,b; Tong et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b) either rely on heavy diffusion models or adopt vector quantization (VQ) (Eslami et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2022) to tokenize images into discrete visual tokens, which encounter limitations including exposure bias (Han et al., 2025) and suboptimal image tokenization (Li et al., 2024c). While recent efforts with continuous latent representations (Fan et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c) have shown promise, significant performance gap persists between autoregressive models and state-of-the-art diffusion methods (Esser et al., 2024; Labs, 2024; Podell et al., 2024), particularly in image quality and consistency. In this paper, we introduce NextStep-1, simple yet effective autoregressive model built on the next-token prediction paradigm that achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-toimage generation tasks. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its competitive performance across suite of challenging benchmarks. Specifically, NextStep-1 demonstrates exceptional compositional and linguistic understanding, achieving 0.54 on WISE (Niu et al., 2025), 0.67 on the advanced prompts of GenAI-Bench (Lin et al., 2024), 85.28 on DPG-Bench (Hu et al., 2024), and 0.417 on the English prompts of OneIG-Bench (Chang et al., 2025). These results demonstrate its capabilities across diverse scenarios, from short and long prompts to tasks Figure 1 Overview of NextStep-1 in high-fidelity image generation, diverse image editing, and complex free-form manipulation. 2 Figure 2 Overview of NextStep-1 Framework. NextStep-1 employs causal transformer to process tokenized text and image tokens. During training, Flow Matching Head predicts the continuous flow from noise sample to the next target image patch, conditioned on the output hidden state. At inference, this allows for generating images by iteratively guiding noise to create the next patch. requiring world knowledge. Beyond generation, the versatility of NextStep-1 is validated by its strong performance on instruction-based image editing, NextStep-1-Edit, achieving competitive scores of 6.58 for English prompts on GEdit-Bench (Liu et al., 2025) and 3.71 on ImgEditBench (Ye et al., 2025). We showcase the qualitatve performance in Fig. 1. NextStep-1 is 14-billion-parameter autoregressive model composed of Transformer backbone, standard language modeling head for discrete text tokens, lightweight flow matching head for continuous image tokens, and an image tokenizer. The flow matching head is 157million-parameter, MLP-based model trained with flow matching objective, following the approach of (Li et al., 2024c). In autoregressive modeling, high-dimensional latent spaces are critical for achieving high image quality but often induce training instability and divergence. Our image tokenizer addresses this trade-off by enhancing the robustness of continuous image tokens and promoting well-dispersed, normalized latent space, thereby ensuring stable convergence even at higher dimensionalities (e.g., 16 channels). Empirical results confirm that this design is essential for stable and effective training with 16-channel latents. 2. Framework 2.1. Unified Multi-model Generation with Continuous Visual Tokens NextStep-1 extends the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm to image generation through simple and intuitive architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 2. To unify multimodal inputs into single sequence, the images will be tokenized to continuous image tokens by the image tokenizer and combined with discrete text tokens. Supposing 𝑥 = {𝑥0, 𝑥1, ..., 𝑥𝑛} is the multimodel token sequence, where 𝑥𝑖 is either discrete text token or continuous visual token, the autoregressive objective under the unified sequence is formalized as: 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑛 (cid:214) 𝑖=1 𝑝(𝑥𝑖 𝑥<𝑖). (1) The unified multi-modal generation task proceeds by sampling the next token 𝑥𝑖 from the conditional distribution 𝑝(𝑥𝑖 𝑥<𝑖) modeled by network. Discrete text tokens are sampled via language modeling head, while continuous image tokens are sampled by flow-matching head. 3 Our training objective consists of two distinct losses: standard cross-entropy loss for discrete text tokens, and flow matching loss (Lipman et al., 2023b) for continuous image tokens. Specifically, the flow matching loss is the mean squared error between the predicted and target velocity vectors that map noised patch to its corresponding clean patch. The model is trained end-to-end by optimizing weighted sum of these two losses: Ltotal = 𝜆textLtext + 𝜆 visualLvisual (2) where Ltext and Lvisual denote the loss for text and image tokens respectively, which are balanced by the hyperparameters 𝜆text and 𝜆 visual. 2.2. Model Architecture Image Tokenizer. Our image tokenizer is fine-tuned from flux VAE (Labs, 2024) with only reconstruction and perceptual losses. The tokenizer first encodes an image into 16-channel latents 𝑧, applying an 8 spatial downsampling factor. To stabilize and normalize the latent space, we apply channel-wise normalization, standardizing each channel to zero mean and unit variance. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the image tokenizer and encourage more uniform latent distribution, we introduce stochastic perturbation to the normalized latents. This technique is adapted from 𝜎-VAE (Sun et al., 2024c), where it was employed to prevent variance collapse. 𝑧 = Normlization(𝑧) + 𝛼 𝜀, where 𝛼 [0, 𝛾] and 𝜀 (0, 𝐼) (3) where 𝜀 is standard Gaussian noise, and its magnitude is scaled by random factor 𝛼 sampled uniformly from [0, 𝛾]. The 𝛾 is hyperparameter controlling the maximum noise intensity. The latents from the image tokenizer are pixel-shuffled into more compact sequence. This is achieved by applying space-to-depth transformation with 22 kernel, which flattens 22 spatial latents into the channel dimension. For example, this converts the latents of 256256 image into 1616 grid of 64-channel tokens. This grid is then flattened into 1D sequence of 256 tokens to serve as input for the following Causal Transformer. Causal Transformer. We initialize our model from the decoder-only Qwen2.5-14B (Yang et al., 2024), leveraging its strong language understanding and reasoning capabilities for text-to-image generation. We organize the multimodal input sequence in the following format: {text} <image_area>h*w <boi> {image} <eoi>... where {text} denotes discrete text tokens, and {image} represents continuous image tokens. <boi> and <eoi> are special tokens marking the beginning-of-image and end-of-image. <image_area>h*w represents the metadata about the spatial dimensions of the 2D image tokens. Then the output hidden states from LLM are passed to two lightweight heads for modalityspecific loss: Language Modeling Head. We compute Cross-Entropy loss for hidden states of texts. Patch-wise Flow Matching Head. Following (Li et al., 2024c), we use each patch-wise image hidden states as condition, denoise target patch at timesteps t, and compute the patch-wise flow-matching loss (Lipman et al., 2023a) with 157M, 12-layer, and 1536 hidden-dimensions MLP. For positional information, we use the standard 1D RoPE (Su et al., 2024). Despite the availability of more complex 2D or multimodal RoPE alternatives (Bai et al., 2025; Wang et al., 4 2024a), we found that the simple 1D formulation remains highly effective for mixed text-image sequences, and thus retain it for simplicity and efficiency. 3. Data To comprehensively equip our model with broad and versatile capabilities, we construct diverse training corpus composed of four primary data categories: text-only corpus, imagetext pair data, image-to-image data, and interleaved data. Each category is curated to serve distinct role in fostering different aspects of the models generative abilities. 3.1. Text-only Corpus To preserve the extensive language capabilities inherent in the large language model (LLM), we incorporate 400B text-only tokens sampled from Step-3 (Wang et al., 2025a) during training. 3.2. Image-Text Pair Data Data consisting of image-text pairs forms the foundation of the models text-to-image generation capabilities. We developed comprehensive pipeline to curate high-quality, large-scale dataset from diverse set of initial sources. 1. Data Sourcing: We collected large-scale dataset from diverse sources, including web data, multi-task VQA data and text-rich documents. 2. Quality-Based Filtering: We then applied rigorous filtering process, evaluating each image on aesthetic quality, watermark presence, clarity, OCR detection, and text-image semantic alignment. 3. Re-captioning: After deduplicating the filtered images, we used the Step-1o-turbo 1 to generate rich and detailed captions for each image in both English and Chinese. This multi-stage pipeline yields final dataset of 550M high-quality image-text pairs, providing foundation for training model with both strong aesthetic sense and broad world knowledge. 3.3. Instruction-Guided Image-to-Image Data To enable wide range of practical applications, we curated high-quality dataset for instructionguided image-to-image tasks, such as visual perception (Kirillov et al., 2023), controllable image generation (Zhang et al., 2023b), image restoration (Labs, 2025), general image editing (Peng et al., 2024), and more. For visual perception and controllable image generation tasks, we synthesized 1M samples by applying the annotator of ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023b) to part of our high-quality image-text pair data. For image restoration and general image editing, we collected 3.5M samples, comprising data from GPT-Image-Edit (Wang et al., 2025c), Step1X-Edit (Liu et al., 2025), and proprietary in-house dataset. Following Step1X-Edit (Liu et al., 2025), all editing data were subjected to rigorous VLM-based filtering pipeline that assessed both image-pair quality, rationality, consistency, and instruction alignment, resulting in about 1M high-quality instruction-guided image-to-image data for training. 1https://platform.stepfun.com/docs/llm/vision 5 Figure 3 Data processing of character-centric data. 3.4. Interleaved data Interleaved data seamlessly integrates text and images, offering rich and nuanced sequential associations between modalities. Specifically, our knowledge-rich interleaved dataset is primarily composed of four distinct categories: general video-interleaved data, tutorials, character-centric scenes, and multi-view data. To endow our model with extensive world knowledge, we first constructed large-scale, 80Msample video-interleaved dataset. This was achieved through meticulous curation pipeline, inspired by Step-Video (Ma et al., 2025a), which encompasses frame extraction, deduplication, and captioning. Furthermore, following the methodology of mmtextbook (Zhang et al., 2025), we collected and processed tutorial videos by leveraging ASR and OCR tools. This component specifically targets text-rich real-world scenes, enhancing the models textual understanding and generation in context. key contribution, detailed in Fig. 3, is our character-centric dataset, NextStep-Video-Interleave-5M. For this dataset, we extracted video frames centered around specific characters and generated rich, storytelling-style captions akin to (Oliveira and de Matos, 2025), thereby significantly improving the models capacity for multi-turn interaction. Finally, to bolster geometric reasoning, we curated multiview data from two open-source datasets, MV-ImageNet-v2 (Han et al., 2024) and Objaverse-XL (Deitke et al., 2023), which enhances the models ability to maintain multiview consistency. 4. Training Recipe 4.1. Training Image Tokenizer Our image tokenizer is initialized from the Flux.1-dev VAE (Labs, 2024), selected for its strong reconstruction performance. We fine-tune this model on the image-text dataset detailed in Sec. 3.2 to adapt it to our specific data distribution. For optimization, we employ the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) with ( 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.95, 𝜀 = 1 108) for its convergence stability. The model is trained for 50K steps with total batch size of 512, using constant learning rate of 1 105 preceded by linear warm-up of 1000 steps. Table 1 Training recipe of NextStep-1.

Pre-Training The specific hyperparameters and data ratios for our pre-training are detailed in Tab. 1. Specifically, the pre-training follows three-stage curriculum designed to progressively refine the models capabilities. Throughout these stages, all model parameters are trained end-to-end except for the pre-trained image tokenizer. Stage1. In this initial stage, the model learns foundational understanding of image structure and composition. For computational efficiency, all images are resized and randomly cropped to fixed 256256 resolution. The training curriculum is composed of diverse data mixture: 20% text-only corpora, 60% image-text pairs, and 20% interleaved data. This stage consumed approximately 1.23T tokens. Stage2. We implement dynamic resolution strategy to train the model on range of higher resolutions, targeting 256256 and 512512 base areas. This strategy utilizes different aspect ratio buckets for computational efficiency. In this stage, we enrich the data mixture with more text-rich and video-interleaved data, leveraging the models enhanced capacity to process fine details at these resolutions. Annealing. In the final stage of pre-training, we perform an annealing phase to sharpen the models capabilities on highly curated dataset. This is achieved by training the model for one epoch on high-quality subset of 20M samples, which were selected from Sec. 3.2 by applying stricter filtering thresholds for aesthetic score, image clarity, semantic similarity, watermark, and so on. This annealing step significantly improves the models final output, enhancing overall image structure, composition, texture, and aesthetic appeal. 4.3. Post-Training Following pre-training on broad corpus to establish generalist model, post-training serves to align the models output with human preferences and downstream tasks. We achieve this alignment via two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The hyperparameters for each stage are in Tab. 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The SFT stage enhances the models instruction-following capabilities and aligns its outputs with human preferences. The SFT dataset, comprising total of 5M samples, is organized into three components: 1) corpus of human-selected image-text pairs with high semantic consistency and visual appeal, augmented by images from other generative models to improve the models handling of complex and imaginative prompts through distillation; 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data (Deng et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2022), improving text-to-image generation by incorporating language-based reasoning step before the final image is created; 3) high-quality instruction-guided image-to-image data from Sec. 3.3 to strengthen the models image editing capabilities. Direct Policy Optimization (DPO). To align our model with human preferences, we employ Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024), method inspired by Diffusion-DPO (Wallace et al., 2024). To this end, we construct two distinct types of preference datasets from curated set of approximately 20,000 diverse prompts. 1. Standard DPO Dataset: For each prompt 𝑐, we directly use the SFT model to generate 16 candidate images. These images is then scored by ImageReward (Xu et al., 2023) to form preference pair ( 𝑦𝑤, 𝑦𝑙), where the winning image 𝑦𝑤 is randomly sampled from the top 4 candidates, while the losing image 𝑦𝑙 is randomly sampled from the remaining 12. 2. Self-CoT DPO Dataset: To enhance the models reasoning capabilities, we introduce an explicit reasoning step. For each prompt 𝑐, we first prompt our model to generate detailed textual CoT, which is then extended to the original prompt. Using this CoT-enhanced prompt, we follow the identical pipeline as above to form preference pair ( 𝑦𝑤, 𝑦𝑙). 5. Model Performance 5.1. Performance of Text-to-Image Generation We comprehensively evaluate the text-to-image (T2I) generation performance of NextStep-1 on several representative benchmarks, each targeting different aspects of image generation, including visual-textual alignment and world knowledge. ImageText Alignment. As shown in Table 2, we assess NextStep-1s prompt-following ability across three key benchmarks. On GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023), NextStep-1 scores 0.63 (0.73 with Self-CoT), demonstrating robust counting, grounding, and spatial alignment. Its strong compositional abilities are further validated on GenAI-Bench (Li et al., 2024a), where it achieves 0.88 on basic prompts and 0.67 on advanced prompts (0.9 and 0.74 with Self-CoT). These results demonstrate NextStep-1 as great autoregressive image generation model, with performance competitive with some diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (Stability-AI, 2024) and BAGEL (Deng et al., 2025). Finally, when evaluated on DPG-Bench (Hu et al., 2024) for longcontext, multi-object scenes, NextStep-1 achieves 85.28, confirming its reliable compositional fidelity under complex prompts. To perform fine-grained analysis, we evaluated our model on OneIG-Bench (Chang et al., 2025) with English prompts. This benchmark assesses performance across areas such as alignment, text rendering, reasoning and stylistic control. As shown in Tab. 3, NextStep-1 achieves an overall score of 0.417. This result significantly outperforms its autoregressive peers, such as Emu3 (Wang et al., 2024b) (0.311) and Janus-Pro (Chen et al., 2025b) (0.267). World Knowledge. To evaluate NextStep-1s ability to integrate world knowledge into image generation, we use the WISE benchmark (Niu et al., 2025), which emphasizes factual grounding 8 Table 2 Comparison of image-text alignment on GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023), GenAI-Bench (Lin et al., 2024), and DPG-Bench (Hu et al., 2024). * result is with rewriting. result is with Self-CoT.

As shown in Table 4, NextStep-1 achieves the best performance among autoregressive models with an overall score of 0.54 (0.67 with Self-CoT), also exceeding most diffusion models. Notably, under the prompt rewrite protocol, its score increases to 0.79 (0.83 with Self-CoT). Collectively, these results demonstrate NextStep-1s robust knowledgeaware semantic alignment and cross-domain reasoning capabilities. 5.2. Performance of Image Editing Quantitative Results on Editing Benchmarks.

In contrast, our model autoregressively generates the image patch-by-patch, modeling the distribution of each patch with significantly more lightweight flow matching model. We argue that this establishes our framework under the pure autoregressive paradigm with next-token prediction (NTP) modeling, rather than diffusion model merely orchestrated by Transformer. key finding from our experiments is the models surprising insensitivity to the size of its flow-matching head. We ablated this on three heads with different sizes (small, base, and large). For each experiment, we re-initialized and trained only the head for 10k steps. Despite the significant variation in model size, all three heads produced remarkably similar results (Tab. 7, Fig. 4). This insensitivity to the heads size strongly suggests that the transformer backbone performs the core generative modeling of the conditional distribution 𝑝(𝑥𝑖 𝑥<𝑖). The flowmatching head, akin to the LM head in language models, primarily acts as lightweight sampler that translates the transformers contextual prediction into continuous token. Consequently, the essential generative logic resides within the transformers autoregressive NTP process. 6.2. Tokenizer is the Key to Image Generation Mitigating Instability under Strong Classifier-Free Guidance. known failure mode in VAE-based autoregressive models is the emergence of visual artifacts, such as gray patches, particularly under strong classifier-free guidance scales (Fan et al., 2024). While prior work hypothesized this instability stemmed from discontinuities in 1D positional embeddings, our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in the amplification of token-level distributional shifts under high guidance scales. At inference time, CFG is introduced to enhance conditional fidelity. The guided prediction 11 Table 6 Configurations for different flow-matching heads.

In diffusion models, inference with high guidance scale is stable because latent variables are typically normalized, ensuring that conditional and unconditional predictions maintain consistent scale. However, in token-level autoregressive models, global normalization of the entire latent tensor does not enforce per-token statistical consistency. Consequently, small discrepancies between conditional and unconditional predictions are magnified by large guidance scale, leading to significant drift in the statistics of generated tokens over the sequence. We empirically demonstrate this phenomenon in Fig. 5. At moderate guidance scale of 1.5, the per-token mean and variance remain stable throughout the generation process. In contrast, at high guidance scale of 3.0, both statistics diverge significantly for later tokens, distributional shift that corresponds directly to the appearance of visual artifacts. Our tokenizer design, which incorporates channel-wise normalization (see Equation (3)), directly addresses this issue by enforcing per-token statistical stability. This simple but critical design choice mitigates the instability, enabling the use of strong guidance without degrading image quality. Regularized Latent Space is Critical for Generation key finding of our work is counterintuitive inverse correlation between the generation loss and the final synthesis quality of the autoregressive model. Specifically, applying higher noise intensity (𝛾 in Equation (3)) during tokenizer training increases generation loss but paradoxically improves the quality of the generated images. For instance, NextStep-1 uses tokenizer trained at 𝛾 = 0.5, which incurred the highest generation loss yet produced the highest-fidelity images. Conversely, tokenizers trained for low generation loss caused the autoregressive model to yield outputs resembling pure noise. We attribute this phenomenon to noise regularization cultivating well-conditioned latent space. This process enhances two key properties: the tokenizer decoders robustness to latent perturbations  (Fig. 6)  and more dispersed latent distribution  (Fig. 7)  , property prior work has also found beneficial for generation (Sun et al., 2024c; Yang et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025). While it remains unclear whether robustness or dispersion plays critical role, these results underscore 12 Figure 5 Evolution of per-token mean and variance over sampling steps under two CFG settings. At CFG = 1.5, the mean and variance stay close to 0 and 1, respectively, indicating stability. At CFG = 3.0, they drift significantly, causing image quality degradation. With normalization, the distributions of output latents remain stable across all CFG settings. Table 8 Comparison of reconstruction performance on ImageNet-1K 256256 (Deng et al., 2009).

Reconstruction Quality is the Upper Bound of Generation Quality. The reconstruction fidelity of the image tokenizer fundamentally determines the upper bound for the quality of the final generated image, particularly for fine details and textures. This principle has been validated in numerous recent studies (Dai et al., 2023; Esser et al., 2024; Labs, 2024), leading to trend 13 Figure 6 Impact of Noise Perturbation on Image Tokenizer Performance. The top panel displays quantitative metrics (rFID, PSNR, and SSIM) versus noise intensity. The bottom panel presents qualitative reconstruction examples at noise standard deviations of 0.2 and 0.5. in the diffusion paradigm of building generative models on top of VAEs with exceptional reconstruction performance (e.g., PSNR > 30). In contrast, VQ-based autoregressive models have historically struggled to surpass this threshold, as shown in Tab. 8. While trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality is often debated (Yao et al., 2025), our work successfully applies autoregressive models to high-fidelity continuous VAEs, bridging this gap. 6.3. Limitations and Challenges Artifacts. While NextStep-1 successfully demonstrates that autoregressive models can operate on high-dimensional continuous latent spaces, achieving generation quality comparable to diffusion models, this approach also introduces unique stability challenges. We observed the emergence of several distinct generative artifacts when transitioning from VAE with lowerdimensional latent space (e.g., spatial downsample factor is 8 and number of latents channel is 4) to one with higher-dimensional space (e.g., spatial downsample factor is 8 and number of latents channel is 16). While the former configuration produced stable outputs, the latter occasionally exhibited failure modes, as illustrated in Fig. 8. While the underlying causes remain an open question, we identify several plausible contributing factors: (1) Local noise or block-shaped artifacts emerging in the later stages of generation may arise from numerical instabilities; (2) Global noise across the image may reflect under-convergence, implying that additional training could mitigate the issue; and (3) Subtle grid-like artifacts could reveal limitations of the 1D positional encoding in capturing 2D spatial 14 Figure 7 Latent distributions in 16 channels for three VAE variants: Flux.1-dev, NextStep-1 w/o noise, and NextStep-1.

Inference Latency of Sequential Decoding. theoretical analysis of per-token latency on an H100 GPU (983 TFLOPS, 3.36 TB/s bandwidth) with batch size of 1, as detailed in Tab. 9, decomposes the contributions of individual components. The results show that the dominant bottleneck lies in the serial decoding of the LLM, while the multi-step sampling in the flowmatching head also constitutes substantial portion of the per-token generation cost. These observations suggest two promising directions for accelerating inference. First, the efficiency of the flow matching head could be improved by reducing its parameter count, applying distillation to achieve few-step generation (Meng et al., 2023), or using more advanced few-step samplers (Lu et al., 2022, 2025). Second, the autoregressive backbone could be accelerated by adapting recent advances from the LLM field, such as speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023) or multi-token prediction (Gloeckle et al., 2024), to the domain of image token generation. Challenges in High-Resolution Training. Our framework faces two primary challenges in scaling to high-resolution image generation, particularly when compared to diffusion models, 15 Figure 8 Failure cases for high-dimensional continuous tokens. which benefit from well-established techniques (Chen et al., 2024; Esser et al., 2024) in this domain. First, the strictly sequential nature of autoregressive generation requires substantially more training steps to converge at higher resolutions. In contrast, diffusion models refine the entire image in parallel at each iteration, enabling more direct exploitation of 2D spatial inductive biases. Second, techniques recently developed for high-resolution diffusion models, such as timestep shift, are difficult to adapt to our setting. This limitation arises because the Flow Matching Head acts primarily as lightweight sampler, while the transformer backbone performs the core generative modeling; thus, modifications to the sampling process have only marginal impact on the final output. Designing high-resolution generation strategies specifically for patch-wise autoregressive models remains an important direction for future research. Challenges in SFT. SFT in our autoregressive framework poses unique challenges compared to diffusion models. We observe that fine-tuning on small, high-quality datasets exhibits unstable dynamics. In contrast to diffusion models, which can often adapt to target distribution and maintain stable and general image generation with only few thousand samples, our SFT process yields substantial improvements only when trained on datasets at the million-sample scale. With smaller datasets, the model remains in precarious equilibrium; it either improves marginally with negligible impact or abruptly overfits to the target distribution. Consequently, identifying an intermediate checkpoint that achieves alignment with the target distribution while preserving general generative capability remains significant challenge. 16 Table 9 Inference latency breakdown at 983 TFLOP/s compute and 3.36 TB/s memory bandwidth.
