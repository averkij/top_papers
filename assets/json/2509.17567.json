            "content": "The emergence of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs)systems that can reason, act, and interact autonomously (Locke, 1987)represents paradigm shift from passive AI assistants to proactive intelligent agents (Wang et al., 2024; Xi et al., 2023). We define Agency as the emergent capacity of AI systems to function as autonomous agentsactively discovering problems, formulating hypotheses, and executing solutions through self-directed engagement with environments and tools. This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency, driven by critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that dont just think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating responses (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023), industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate tools, and drive real-world outcomes through capabilities like autonomous task execution (Qin et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Parisi et al., 2022), multi-step reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2024b; Besta et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023b; Dhuliawala et al., 2023), and collaborative problem-solving (Li et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Qian et al., 2023). However, the development of such agentic systems faces critical challenges. Current approaches assume that more data yields better agentic intelligence, following traditional scaling laws from language modeling (Kaplan et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Scao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). This paradigm leads to increasingly complex training pipelines and substantial resource requirements, yet this fundamental assumption remains largely untested: do agentic capabilities truly require exposure to vast amounts of training data, or could they emerge more efficiently through strategic approaches? Emerging evidence from adjacent domains suggests compelling alternative paradigm. LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) achieved effective model alignment with only 1,000 carefully curated examples, while LIMO (Ye et al., 2025) demonstrated that complex mathematical reasoning can emerge from just 817 strategically selected training samples, achieving remarkable 45.8% absolute improvement with only 1% of the data typically required. These convergent findings suggest that strategic data curation may be fundamentally more powerful than dataset scale for developing sophisticated AI capabilities, naturally leading us to investigate whether agentic intelligence follows similar efficiency principles. We introduce LIMI (Less Is More for Intelligent Agency), which demonstrates that agency follows radically different development principles from traditional scaling approaches. Through strategic focus on collaborative software development and scientific research workflowsdomains that collectively span the majority of knowledge work scenarioswe show that sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Our approach is grounded in three core innovations: (i) First, we pioneer novel agentic user query synthesis methodologies, including human-AI collaborative query collection from realworld scenarios and systematic GitHub pull request-based query synthesis using advanced LLMs, ensuring that our training demonstrations capture authentic patterns of agentic behavior while maintaining ecological validity; (ii) Second, we develop systematic trajectory collection protocol that captures complete multi-turn interaction sequences for each curated query, recording the full collaborative workflow from initial task understanding through iterative model reasoning, tool utilization, and environmental feedback to successful task completion, providing high-quality training demonstrations of sophisticated agentic behavior in realistic operational contexts; (iii) Third, we reveal the data efficiency principle for AI agency cultivation, demonstrating that sophisticated agentic intelligence emerges from strategic curation of minimal high-quality demonstrations rather than large-scale data accumulation, fundamentally challenging traditional scaling paradigms in agentic AI development. Using only 78 carefully designed training samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks, dramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%). Most strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on 10,000 samplesachieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer samples. These findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of high-quality agentic demonstrations. This discovery fundamentally reshapes how we develop autonomous AI systems, suggesting that mastering agency requires understanding its essence, not scaling training data. As industries transition from thinking AI to working AI, LIMI provides paradigm for sustainable cultivation of truly agentic intelligence, demonstrating that the key to effective agentic AI development lies in strategic data curation rather than computational scale."

As illustrated in Figure 2, these scenarios demand sophisticated integration of capabilities including autonomous task execution, multi-step reasoning, and collaborative problem-solving across diverse domains like software development and scientific research. Such tasks exhibit temporal complexity through multi-round interactions requiring coherent state tracking and cumulative reasoning. They demand strategic planning capabilities that decompose complex objectives into manageable sub-goals while adapting strategies based on environmental feedback. Tool orchestration becomes essential as real-world agentic tasks require coordinated use of multiple systems with integrated result processing. Collaborative communication ensures effective human-AI coordination throughout extended problem-solving processes, distinguishing agentic intelligence from passive AI systems that merely respond to individual queries. 2.2 Domain Specification: Vibe Coding and Research Workflows To validate our approach, we focus on two fundamental domains that collectively span the majority of knowledge work scenarios and require the full spectrum of agentic capabilities. Vibe Coding Vibe coding represents collaborative software development where LLMs or agents work alongside human developers in natural, context-rich environments. This domain demands code understanding and generation across existing codebases, development environment navigation through complex tool ecosystems, iterative problem solving through debugging and optimization cycles, and collaborative communication for technical coordination. The complexity lies in holistic understanding of development contexts and principled decision-making under evolving requirements. Research Workflows Research workflows encompass scenarios where agents navigate complex scientific processes, including literature search, data analysis, experiment design, and insight generation. These workflows 3 3. Dataset Construction Figure 3: LIMI Data Construction Pipeline.

            "content": "The effectiveness of the LIMI approach relies fundamentally on strategic data curation that captures essential agentic behaviors through real-world collaborative tasks. As illustrated in Figure 3, this section describes our comprehensive methodology for constructing training data that validates the Less-Is-More hypothesis for agentic intelligence, focusing on the systematic collection and curation of real-world collaborative tasks. 3.1 Framework and Notation We formalize our data construction process around the fundamental elements of agentic interaction, defining each complete interaction as tuple (qi, τi) where queries initiate collaborative workflows and trajectories capture complete interaction sequences. Query Definition We begin with the query qi as the foundational element that initiates agentic interaction. Each query represents natural language specification from the user that articulates the desired objective, ranging from software development requirements in vibe coding scenarios to research tasks in scientific workflows. The query establishes both the starting point and success criteria for the subsequent collaborative process. Trajectory Formalization The trajectory τi = {ai,1, . . . , ai,ni} captures the subsequent collaborative trajectory following the initial query. Each action ai,j in the trajectory represents one of three fundamental interaction types that constitute the agentic response process. Model reasoning (mi,j) captures the agentic models reasoning output demonstrating understanding, analysis, planning, and decision-making processes. Model tool calling (ti,j) represents structured tool invocations executed by the model to interact with external environments and accomplish specific subtasks. Environment observation (oi,j) includes results and outputs returned from tool executions, as well as user feedback and clarifications provided during the collaborative process, which inform subsequent model reasoning cycles. The sequential index maintains the temporal ordering of these interactions within trajectory i, and ni denotes the total number of actions required for query resolution. This formalization captures the complete collaborative workflow by separating the initial task specification from the dynamic interaction process, enabling models to learn from realistic collaborative patterns that demonstrate sophisticated agentic behavior in operational contexts. 3.2 Query Pool Construction Our query collection strategy combines authentic real-world scenarios with systematically expanded coverage to ensure both ecological validity and sufficient training diversity for agentic intelligence development. Real-world Query Collection We collect 60 queries from actual scenarios encountered by professional developers and researchers in collaborative environments. These queries represent authentic challenges that arise in real-world software development and research workflows, capturing the natural complexity and contextual richness of humanAI collaborative work across both domains. Notably, substantial portion of the research queries are derived from real academic papers (Xiao et al., 2025a,b; Jiang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Sun et al., 2025, 2024), ensuring authentic representation of genuine research challenges."

            "content": "Figure 4: Characteristics of LIMIs training data. Left: Trajectory length distribution showing interaction complexity (average 42.4k tokens). Right: Domain coverage across vibe coding and research workflows. GitHub PR-based Query Synthesis To systematically expand our query pool while maintaining authenticity and real-world relevance, we develop pipeline for synthesizing additional queries from GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) using GPT-5 (OpenAI). This approach leverages the rich context of real code changes and employs GPT-5s advanced reasoning capabilities to generate authentic collaborative scenarios that reflect genuine development needs, ensuring that synthesized queries maintain the semantic fidelity and contextual complexity of real-world development challenges. Our systematic curation process involves multiple stages for quality assurance: (1) Repository Selection: We select repositories with more than 10,000 GitHub stars to ensure high-quality, well-maintained codebases that represent industry best practices. (2) Domain Diversification: We ensure comprehensive coverage across diverse software development domains, including frontend development, backend systems, deployment infrastructure, debugging, and code optimization, among others, and finally select 100 repositories. (3) Complexity Filtering: We filter PRs based on the unified diff patch token count (below 1,200 tokens) and exclude PRs that only modify Markdown files, focusing on substantive code changes that require meaningful agentic intervention. (4) Scale and Sampling: From 100 selected repositories, we collect 1,000 PRs per repository, then randomly sample 100 PRs each for query synthesis to ensure statistical representativeness while maintaining manageable annotation workload. (5) Quality Assurance: We employ four PhD students in computer science as expert annotators to evaluate the quality of synthesized queries. The evaluation criteria focus on semantic alignment between the generated query and the corresponding PR content, ensuring that synthetic queries accurately capture the intent and context of real development scenarios. Through this systematic process, we successfully generate several thousand high-quality synthetic queries from the GitHub PR pipeline. To align with our LIMI approachs focus on vibe coding and research workflows, we strategically sample 18 queries that best match these two core domains, ensuring optimal coverage of collaborative software development and research-oriented tasks. The category of user queries is illustrated in Figure 4. These carefully curated queries are then used for trajectory collection, while the remaining synthetic queries and their corresponding trajectory data will be released in future work to benefit the broader research community. Through this systematic approach, we assemble comprehensive query pool = {q1, q2, . . . , q78} consisting of 78 high-quality queries. This strategically curated query pool forms the foundation of our LIMI training data. Each query reflects authentic collaborative scenarios from vibe coding or research workflows, ensuring that the dataset captures the full spectrum of challenges encountered in professional development and research. 3.3 Trajectory Collection for Training Dataset To generate training trajectories that demonstrate optimal agentic behavior and validate the real-world effectiveness of our LIMI approach, we require sophisticated execution environment that enables authentic human-AI collaboration. This environment must support complex tool interactions, maintain detailed interaction logging, and provide the operational context necessary for realistic agentic intelligence assessment."

Execution Environment Selection Several command line interface (CLI) environments are available for agentic model, including Claude Code1, Gemini CLI2, and SII CLI (Lin et al., 2025). We select SII CLI as our execution environment based on several critical advantages: (1) comprehensive tool integration that supports both vibe coding and research workflows, (2) detailed trajectory logging capabilities essential for high-quality training data collection, (3) flexible human-AI collaboration interfaces that enable natural interaction patterns, and (4) robust support for complex multi-step tasks requiring coordinated tool usage. These capabilities make SII CLI particularly well-suited for validating our hypothesis that strategic data curation yields superior agentic intelligence. The SII CLI environment provides comprehensive toolkit that enables seamless collaboration across diverse knowledge work scenarios, integrating essential tools for software development, research activities, and information processing within unified interface. This tool-rich environment ensures that our collected trajectories capture realistic collaborative contexts where effective task execution requires coordinated use of multiple capabilities and continuous interaction between human collaborators and agentic models. Controlled Trajectory Collection Protocol Using the queries in our training set within the SII CLI environment, we employ systematic data collection protocol designed to capture optimal agentic behavior patterns. Four PhD student annotators serve as human collaborators, working alongside GPT-5 as the agentic model to complete the 78 training queries in realistic collaborative scenarios. For each query qi, we employ an iterative collection approach, continuously gathering trajectories until successful completion is achieved. This persistent methodology ensures that collected trajectories capture authentic human-AI interaction patterns, including natural back-and-forth communication, iterative refinement processes, and collaborative problem-solving strategies that characterize effective agentic behavior. The data collection process captures complete interaction sequences for each query qi, generating the corresponding trajectory τi = {ai,1, . . . , ai,ni} that includes all fundamental interaction types defined in our framework: model reasoning (mi,j), model tool calling (ti,j), and environment observation (oi,j). As shown in Figure 4, by ensuring every query achieves successful resolution, our training dataset provides comprehensive examples of strategic reasoning, tool utilization, error recovery, and collaborative communication that our LIMI approach leverages for efficient learning. These trajectories capture extensive interaction sequences, with the longest trajectory reaching 152k tokens, demonstrating the depth and complexity of collaborative problem-solving processes that characterize sophisticated agentic behavior. This approach guarantees that our models learn not only from successful outcomes but also from the complete problem-solving process, including how to adapt strategies and recover from failures during collaborative execution. 3.4 Evaluation Benchmarks Our evaluation framework encompasses two complementary assessment strategies to comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the LIMI approach across diverse agentic scenarios. Primary Evaluation on AgencyBench We evaluate all models on AgencyBench (Li et al., 2025b), comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically designed for assessing agentic capabilities in collaborative scenarios. The tasks in AgencyBench are illustrated in Table 1. AgencyBench contains carefully curated tasks that reflect the complexity and collaborative nature of real-world agentic scenarios across both vibe coding and research workflows, providing rigorous test of the LIMI hypothesis that strategic data curation yields superior agentic intelligence. 1https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code 2https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli 6 4. Experiments This benchmark enables direct measurement of our models performance on representative queries that mirror the authentic collaborative contexts. Generalization Assessment To assess generalization capabilities beyond our core domains, we evaluate model performance on established benchmarks spanning diverse agentic and coding scenarios: tau2-bench-airline and tau2-bench-retail (Yao et al., 2024a; Barres et al., 2025) for tool use capabilities, evalplus-humaneval and evalplusmbpp (Liu et al., 2024, 2023) for code generation performance, DS-1000 (Lai et al., 2022) for data science and code generation tasks, and SciCode (Tian et al., 2024) for scientific computing applications. This comprehensive evaluation suite ensures that our findings generalize beyond the specific domains of vibe coding and research workflows. Evaluation Metrics Our evaluation employs different metrics tailored to each benchmarks characteristics and objectives. For the AgencyBench evaluation, we adopt the comprehensive metrics defined in the benchmark to capture both effectiveness and efficiency dimensions of collaborative intelligence. Effectiveness metrics include: (1) First-Turn Functional Completeness (FTFC), measuring the percentage of requirements correctly implemented in the initial response; (2) Success Rate (SR@R), representing the percentage of queries successfully completed within allocated rounds. Efficiency metrics include: (3) Remaining Chances (RC@R), calculating the average number of unused rounds when queries are successfully completed, measuring computational efficiency. The parameter defines the maximum interaction rounds allocated for query completion. In our implementation, we set = 3 to balance iterative refinement with computational efficiency. For generalization benchmarks, we follow the default evaluation settings specified by the respective benchmark and employ the standard metrics they establish: Passˆ4 accuracy on tau2-bench-airline and tau2-bench-retail, which is defined as the fraction of 4 independent runs that succeed, to measure tool-use success rates; accuracy for evalplus-humaneval, evalplus-mbpp, and DS-1000 to assess code generation and data science capabilities; and accuracy for SciCode to measure scientific computing performance. These established metrics enable direct comparison with prior work and validate the generalization capabilities of our LIMI approach across diverse domains beyond vibe coding and research workflows. The combination of AgencyBenchs multi-dimensional agentic metrics and the standard accuracy metrics from generalization benchmarks ensures that our evaluation captures both the specialized collaborative intelligence required for our target domains and the broader capabilities necessary for general agentic applications."

            "content": "4.1 Experiment Setup To validate the LIMI hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategic data curation approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments comparing our approach against strong baseline models across multiple evaluation dimensions. Baseline Models We evaluate against diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models to ensure comprehensive comparison: GLM-4.5 (Zeng et al., 2025), GLM-4.5-Air (Zeng et al., 2025), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct3 (Yang et al., 2025), DeepSeek-V3.1 (Yang et al., 2025), Kimi-K2-Instruct4 (Team et al., 2025). This selection encompasses open-source models with varying architectural designs and training methodologies, enabling rigorous evaluation of agentic capabilities. Model Training and Variants To systematically evaluate the impact of our curated training data, we fine-tune both GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air using our training dataset. All fine-tuning experiments are conducted using the slime framework 5, which provides robust and efficient infrastructure for supervised fine-tuning of large language models. The slime framework ensures consistent training conditions, hyperparameter optimization, and convergence criteria across all experimental variants, enabling fair and reproducible comparison between different training approaches. Additionally, to assess the quality and effectiveness of our data curation strategy, we conduct comparative experiments by fine-tuning GLM-4.5 on three alternative datasets: CC-Bench-trajectories6 (Zeng et al., 2025), AFMWebAgent-SFT-Dataset 7, and AFM-CodeAgent-SFT-Dataset 8.

All fine-tuning experiments utilize identical training configurations within the slime framework to ensure that performance differences reflect data quality rather than implementation variations. For clarity, we refer to models fine-tuned with our curated dataset as LIMI (corresponding to fine-tuning GLM-4.5) and LIMI-Air (corresponding to fine-tuning GLM-4.5-Air). Models trained on alternative datasets are denoted with corresponding suffixes: CC for CC-Bench-trajectories dataset, Web for AFM-WebAgent-SFTDataset (PersonalAILab, 2024), and Code for AFM-CodeAgent-SFT-Dataset (PersonalAILab, 2024). Environment Configurations critical aspect of our evaluation involves assessing model performance under different operational conditions. We systematically evaluate both base models and fine-tuned variants under two distinct configurations: with SII CLI environment access and without SII CLI environment access. This dual-environment evaluation enables us to isolate the contribution of tool-enhanced capabilities versus intrinsic model reasoning abilities. When evaluating models without SII CLI environment access, we focus on the generalization benchmarks (tau2bench, evalplus, DS-1000, and SciCode) since AgencyBench tasks inherently require tool interaction capabilities for meaningful completion. This configuration provides valuable insights into model performance on established benchmarks and helps distinguish between environment-dependent and environment-independent improvements achieved through our training approach. This comprehensive experimental design ensures rigorous validation of the LIMI hypothesis while providing detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying effective agentic intelligence development through strategic data curation. 4.2 Main Results Superior Performance on AgencyBench Against State-of-the-Art Models Our experimental results demonstrate that LIMI achieves substantial performance advantages over leading foundation models on agentic intelligence tasks. As shown in Table 2, LIMI achieves an impressive average score of 73.5% on AgencyBench, significantly outperforming all baseline models: GLM-4.5 (45.1%), Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%). The performance gap is particularly pronounced in first-turn functional completeness (FTFC), where LIMI achieves 71.7% compared to the best baseline performance of 37.8% from GLM-4.5, representing remarkable 33.9 percentage point improvement. Similarly, LIMI demonstrates superior task completion reliability with 74.6% success rate, substantially exceeding the 47.4% achieved by GLM-4.5, the strongest baseline model. These results establish LIMI as the new state-of-the-art for agentic intelligence across multiple evaluation dimensions. Consistent Advantages Across Diverse Generalization Benchmarks LIMIs superiority extends across established benchmarks spanning tool use, coding, and scientific computing domains  (Table 3)  . With an average performance of 57.2%, LIMI outperforms all baseline models including GLM-4.5 (43.0%), Kimi-K2-Instruct"

Notably, LIMI achieves the highest performance on critical coding benchmarks (EvalPlus-HumanEval: 92.1%, EvalPlus-MBPP: 82.3%) and demonstrates competitive results on tool use tasks (TAU2-bench-airline: 34.0%, TAU2-bench-retail: 45.6%). The consistent performance advantages across diverse evaluation domains demonstrate that our strategic data curation approach yields broad improvements in model capabilities, establishing strong performance across multiple domains beyond our core vibe coding and research workflows focus. 4.3 Data Efficiency Analysis Strategic Curation Dramatically Outperforms Scale-Based Approaches Our experimental results provide compelling empirical evidence for the core LIMI hypothesis that strategic data curation is fundamentally more effective than simply scaling training data volume for developing agentic intelligence. As demonstrated in Table 2, LIMI achieves exceptional performance using only 78 carefully curated training samples, substantially outperforming models trained on datasets that are orders of magnitude larger. Most striking is the comparison with GLM-4.5-Code trained on the AFM-CodeAgent-SFT-Dataset: LIMIs 73.5% average AgencyBench performance dramatically exceeds the 47.8% achieved by the large-scale approach, despite using dataset 128 times smaller (78 vs. 10,000 samples). This represents remarkable 53.7 percentage point improvement with dramatically fewer training examples. Data Efficiency Advantages Extend to Generalization Benchmarks The data efficiency benefits of our strategic curation approach are not limited to AgencyBench but extend consistently across diverse generalization benchmarks  (Table 3)  . LIMI achieves 57.2% average performance across tool use, coding, and scientific computing tasks, substantially outperforming all alternative training approaches despite using significantly fewer samples. Compared to GLM-4.5-Code (40.9% with 10,000 samples), LIMI demonstrates 39.9% relative improvement with 128 times fewer training examples. Similarly, LIMI outperforms GLM-4.5-Web (33.7% with 7,610 samples) by 69.7% relative improvement using 97 times less data, and exceeds GLM-4.5-CC (39.2% with 260 samples) by 45.9% relative improvement with only 30% of the training data. These consistent improvements across diverse evaluation domains validate that strategic data curation enables more effective capability transfer than large-scale data collection, establishing the Less-Is-More paradigm as broadly applicable to agentic intelligence development. 4.4 Generalization Analysis Cross-Model Scalability Demonstrates Architectural Robustness Our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness across different model scales, validating the broad applicability of strategic data curation for agentic intelligence development. As shown in Table 2, LIMI-Air (106B) achieves substantial improvements over its base model GLM-4.5-Air, with average AgencyBench performance increasing from 17.0% to 34.3%a notable 17.3 percentage point improvement. Similarly, LIMI (355B) demonstrates significant enhancement over GLM-4.5, improving from 45.1% to 73.5%. This consistent improvement pattern across different model scales indicates that our strategic data curation methodology captures fundamental patterns of agentic behavior that transfer effectively regardless of model capacity, suggesting broad architectural compatibility with the LIMI training paradigm."

As shown in Table 4, LIMI maintains its competitive advantage even without tool access, achieving 50.0% average performance compared to GLM-4.5s 48.7%demonstrating that our training approach provides fundamental capability improvements independent of environmental enhancements. Notably, LIMI outperforms all external baseline models including GLM-4.5 (48.7%), Kimi-K2-Instruct (40.3%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (36.5%), and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (37.3%) in this tool-free evaluation, establishing that our strategic data curation yields genuine capability improvements rather than mere tool-usage optimization. CLI Environment Enables Full Expression of Agentic Capabilities While LIMI demonstrates intrinsic improvements independent of tool access, the integration with SII CLI significantly amplifies these benefits for complex agentic tasks requiring collaborative execution. Comparing performance with CLI access (Table 3: 57.2%) versus without CLI access (Table 4: 50.0%), LIMI shows 7.2 percentage point improvement when tools are available. This performance gain reflects the models enhanced ability to leverage environmental resources effectively, demonstrating that our training approach not only improves foundational reasoning capabilities but also develops sophisticated tool coordination skills. The synergistic relationship validates our integrated methodology: strategic data curation provides foundational improvements in reasoning and planning, while the SII CLI environment allows these capabilities to be fully expressed through effective tool utilization in realistic collaborative scenarios that mirror the training context."

            "content": "5.1 Agentic Language Model The development of agentic language models signifies fundamental paradigm shift from passive text generation to autonomous decision-making systems. Early key contributions laid the foundation for modern agentic capabilities: Schick et al. (2023) introduced Toolformer, demonstrating that language models can learn to use external tools via APIs in self-supervised manner, while Yao et al. (2023) proposed ReAct, which synergizes reasoning and acting by enabling LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. The emergence of autonomous systems like Significant Gravitas (2025) marked the transition toward fully autonomous agents capable of breaking down high-level goals into manageable subtasks and executing them independently. Building upon these early breakthroughs, the latest research has shifted its focus to foundational models specifically designed for agentic capabilities. GLM-4.5 (Zeng et al., 2025) provides unified approach to reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, featuring hybrid reasoning modes and achieving 90.6% tool-calling success rate. Similarly, Kimi-K2 (Team et al., 2025) introduces trillion-parameter MoE architecture specifically optimized for agentic intelligence with native tool use capabilities and verifiable reward training. The integration of reinforcement learning has become central to developing robust agentic systems, with Zhang et al. (2025) formalizing this evolution as the transition from single-step preference optimization to temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes. However, current training methodologiesincluding those employed by state-of-the-art models like GLM-4.5 and Kimi-K2predominantly rely on large-scale data synthesis and extensive computational resources. Our work addresses this limitation by demonstrating that sophisticated agentic capabilities can emerge from strategically curated minimal data, offering more efficient path toward developing capable agentic systems. 5.2 Data Efficiency in Language Models The paradigm of data efficiency in language models has gained significant attention as researchers recognize that strategic data curation can yield superior results compared to scaling training data volume. Zhou et al. (2023) demonstrate that with just 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, models can achieve effective 6. Conclusion alignment and generalize to diverse tasks. Building upon this foundation, Ye et al. (2025) extend this paradigm to complex mathematical reasoning, achieving remarkable 45.8% improvement with only 817 strategically selected training samples. However, applying these data efficiency principles to agentic intelligencewhere systems must autonomously discover problems, formulate hypotheses, and execute solutions through collaborative engagement with environments and toolsremains unexplored. Our work bridges this gap by extending the Less-Is-More paradigm to autonomous agents, demonstrating that sophisticated agentic capabilities can emerge from strategically curated demonstrations of collaborative behavior."

            "content": "We demonstrate that sophisticated agentic capabilities can emerge through minimal but strategically curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior rather than massive dataset scaling. Using only 78 carefully designed training samples focused on vibe coding and research workflows, our approach achieves 73.5% performance on AgencyBench, substantially outperforming models trained on datasets up to 128 times larger. These findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of high-quality agentic demonstrations. Our work fundamentally challenges conventional scaling paradigms in agentic AI development, demonstrating that mastering agency requires understanding its essence rather than accumulating training data."

            "content": "In this chapter, we provide all 10 examples from AgencyBench, including four vibe coding and six vibe research tasks. Each task contains several subtasks. Among them, tasks 6 and 8 include some raw code and data files, but we only present the queries. A.1 Vibe Coding Task 1: C++ Console Chat System Project: Advanced C++ Console Chat System General Rules: - All code should be placed under workspace/. - Use g++ -std=c++17 for compilation. - Each task must provide clear startup command. - Functionality expands step by step, with increasing difficulty (from simple UI data persistence friend relationship graph chat history indexing concurrency and consistency). Subtask 1 Login & Registration System Description: Implement command-line login/registration interface. - Users can register an account (username + password), data is saved to file (local persistence). - On login, the password must be verified. - After successful login, the user enters the main menu (prompt). Run: cd workspace make task1 ./bin/chat app Success Criteria: Able to register new user and log in again with the same credentials after restarting the program. Subtask 2 Friend Management & Chat Entry Description: Extend Task 1 with: - Support adding/removing friends. - Display the friend list (with status: online/offline). - Select friend to enter the chat interface (chat not yet implemented). Run: cd workspace make task2 ./bin/chat app Success Criteria: Able to add/remove friends, and the friend list persists across program restarts. Subtask 3 Single Chat Function + Chat History Storage Description: Implement real single chat interface. - When chatting with friend, the user can input and send messages. - Simulated replies are automatically generated from preset script. - Chat history is stored locally (one history file per friend). - Support the /history command to view chat history (with pagination). Run: cd workspace make task3 ./bin/chat app Success Criteria: Able to send messages, receive simulated replies, and view past chat history after program restart. Subtask 4 Advanced Features: Friend Alias + Global Search Description: Extend Task 3 with: - Support setting an alias (nickname) for friends. The alias is displayed in the chat interface and friend list instead of the system ID. 14 A.1 Vibe Coding - Implement global chat history search engine: input keyword to search across all friends chat histories, highlighting matching snippets. - Search must support fuzzy matching (case-insensitive, partial string match).

Consider: - The main technical challenge or implementation requirement - The primary skill set needed to complete the work - The type of code changes being made 3. Extract Key Information: From the PR data, identify: - Repository ID and PR number - Files that need to be modified (changed in the PR) - Related files that provide context (mentioned or relevant to understanding) - The specific technical requirements and implementation details 4. Generate Test Query: Create clear, specific query that an AI agent could receive to implement this task. The query should: - Be written as if from developer requesting help - Include specific technical requirements - Mention key technologies, frameworks, or patterns involved - Be concrete enough to have testable outcome Output Requirements Provide your analysis in the following JSON format: json { test query: clear, specific query that describes what needs to be implemented, as if developer is asking an AI agent for help. Should include technical requirements, expected behavior, and key implementation details., repo id: <repository id from pr data>, pr id: <pr number from pr data>, task category: <selected task id and name>, modified files: [ file1.ext, file2.ext ], related files: [ related file1.ext, related file2.ext ], reasoning: Brief explanation of why you selected this task category and how you identified the key files and requirements. } Important Notes - Focus on the primary technical challenge - dont try to capture every minor aspect of the PR - The test query should be specific and actionable - an AI agent should be able to implement solution based on this query alone - Include only files that are directly modified in modified files, and files that provide necessary context in related files - The task category should be the single best match from the provided list - Keep the reasoning concise but informative Now, analyze the provided PR data and generate the task extraction."

            "content": "In this chapter, we present the real responses of the GLM-4.5 base model and our LIMI on several agency bench tasks, thereby demonstrating the outstanding performance of LIMI. C.1 Real-world Vibe Coding Scenarios Task 1 is vibe coding assignment that involves building an advanced console-based chat system in C++, with five subtasks of increasing difficulty. For the glm-4.5 base model combined with sii-cli, an error occurred during subtask 3 where the chat history could not be displayed and could not be fixed, and in subtask 4, timeout development error appeared. In contrast, with our GLM-4.5-LIMI, each subtask was successfully completed. Task 3 is typical example of vibe coding. The specific assignment is to build front-end Gomoku mini-game, with five progressively more difficult subtasks. The detailed task descriptions can be found in the appendix. For the GLM-4.5 base model, during the first few rounds of interaction using sii-cli as the scaffolding tool, issues occurred one after another: board rendering failed, win/loss detection failed, and manual intervention was required for corrections. Ultimately, the model got stuck at implementing different difficulty levels for the human-vs-AI mode and failed on that subtask. In contrast, for our GLM-4.5-LIMI, although the final implementation of AI difficulty was not perfect, all the other subtasks were successfully completed without requiring interactive hints. 27 C.2 Research Workflow Applications C.2 Research Workflow Applications Task 7 is dataset-searching assignment on Hugging Face based on given requirements, divided into three subtasks (detailed descriptions can be found in the appendix). The original dataset search queries were carefully selected from gated datasets on Hugging Face and manually verified. The dataset IDs corresponding to the three original subtasks are EpistemeAI/alpaca-QA-conciousness-emotions, jiyounglee0523/TransEnV mmlu, and DDSC/dkhate. We required sii-cli to search only from non-gated datasets on Hugging Face in order to prevent retrieving the original datasets directly. The glm-4.5 base model returned the following results: InnerI/CAI-synthetic-10k, allenai/sciq, and mteb/DKHateClassification. The GLM-4.5-LIMI model returned: mrfakename/identity dpo, allenai/sciq, and strombergnlp/offenseval 2020. After human experts compared the retrieved datasets against the requirements in the queries item by item, the datasets found by GLM-4.5-LIMI were judged to be more suitable. Task 8 is designed to test the agents ability to create equations that fit data, with subtasks requiring progressively smaller loss values. For GLM-4.5-Base, after multiple rounds of manual interaction and prompting, the final loss reached 1.14e-6. In contrast, GLM-4.5-LIMI achieved loss of 5.95e-7 on its very first attemptan order of magnitude smaller. Task 9 evaluates the agents ability to search the web, integrate information, and provide final judgment using reasoning. It consists of three specific subtasks involving NBA players to be identified according to given conditions: For the first subtask, GLM-4.5-Base initially answered Victor Oladipo, and only after one round of manual prompting did it produce the correct answer, Paul George. GLM-4.5-LIMI, however, answered correctly without any additional hints. For the second subtask, GLM-4.5-Base exhausted all allowed manual prompts, producing incorrect answers such as Nate Tiny Archibald and Wilt Chamberlain. GLM-4.5-LIMI, although it first incorrectly answered Oscar Robertson, required only one manual prompt to arrive at the correct answer, James Harden. For the third subtask, both models answered correctly with Kevin Durant. However, GLM-4.5-LIMI required significantly fewer reasoning steps, tokens, and response time. For the fourth subtask, GLM-4.5-Base failed even after reaching the maximum number of allowed manual prompts. GLM-4.5-LIMI, though initially incorrect with Jamal Murray, needed only one additional prompt to provide the correct answer, Klay Thompson."
