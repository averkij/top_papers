            "content": "Text-to-video (T2V) generation [115] has attracted significant attention for its ability to synthesize realistic videos from textual descriptions. While most existing methods focuses on improving visual quality, the efficiency of T2V diffusion models remains underexplored.In practical deployment scenarios, especially on resource-constrained devices such as iGPUs and NPUs, model size and inference speed are critical factors. Achieving both computational efficiency and high visual performance remains significant challenge. Recent efforts [16, 17, 4, 18] aim to improve efficiency by reducing the number of inference steps. For instance, VideoLCM [16] introduces self-consistency loss in the latent space to align model performance across different step counts. AnimateLCM [17] uses consistency distillation to accelerate generation. Despite these advances, the models remain large, which makes deployment on edge devices difficult. One na√Øve solution is to prune the network structure. However, this often leads to performance degradation because it disrupts the learned diffusion priors, even when followed by fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we propose two-stage diffusion model distillation pipeline that first prunes model parameters and then restores visual quality through visual feedback learning. Specifically, our method reduces the U-Net size from 1.4 billion parameters, as seen in the widely used VideoCrafter2 [2], to 0.7 billion. This enables high-quality video generation with minimal inference steps. The resulting efficient T2V model, named AMD-Hummingbird, achieves 31 speedup over VideoCrafter2 when deployed on AMD Instinct MI250 accelerators. In addition, on consumer laptop equipped with an iGPU (Radeon 880M) and CPU (Ryzen AI 9 365), the model generates 26-frame video in just 50 seconds*. We also introduce novel data processing pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to recaption text prompts and select high-quality video samples, thereby optimizing training and improving the model performance. The proposed Hummingbird highlights AMDs significant advancements in AI-driven video generation. The main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose an innovative network pruning strategy for T2V models that significantly reduces model parameters while maintaining visual quality through visual feedback learning. The proposed method can generate high-quality long videos with up to 26 frames. We introduce novel data processing pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to recaption text prompts and employs video quality assessment (VQA) models to select high-quality video samples for training. We publicly release the training code and data processing pipeline, enabling users to easily customize the style of generated videos. This provides flexibility to adapt models to specific needs and preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 31 speedup over stateof-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also achieving the highest overall score on VBench."

            "title": "2 Motivation",
            "content": "The development of Hummingbird is driven by several key factors. Firstly, efficiency plays crucial role. Existing open-source T2V models like VideoCrafter2 [2] and CogVideo [10] have made significant strides in visual performance, but they do not yet achieve efficient generation on typical GPUs. There is critical need for smaller models that align with operational constraints while maintaining high performance. Another important consideration is model size and inference speed. Most current research emphasizes improving visual performance, often at the expense of model size and inference speed, which are crucial for practical deployment. AMD approach focuses on balancing these aspects to ensure both high-quality outputs and efficient operations. Customization is also key advantage of building our own model. The proposed structural distillation method allows for adaptable and reward-optimized models, providing users with tailored solutions that meet their specific needs. Data quality is essential for effective model learning. This novel data processing pipeline helps ensure that the model is trained on top-quality visual and textual data, enhancing its performance and reliability. High-quality training data is critical for the model to generate richer textural details and better understand textual input. Finally, by open sourcing the training code, dataset, and model weights, AMD supports the AI community. This enables developers to replicate and explore T2V generation on AMD AI platforms, fostering an open and collaborative approach to AI development, and ensuring that the benefits of AI advancements are widely shared."

            "content": "The proposed data processing pipeline includes video quality assessment, motion estimation, and prompt re-captioning. Low-quality video data can slow the convergence of the loss function during training and reduce the performance of the T2V diffusion model. To address this issue, the pipeline begins by applying Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models [19] to evaluate each videos quality based on aesthetic and compression-related metrics, as shown in Figure 2. motion estimation module is then used to filter out dolly zoom videos from the set of high-quality samples. To improve the quality of textual inputs, the pipeline leverages the prior knowledge of large language model, specifically LLaMA-8B [20], to perform prompt re-captioning. Experimental results show that training on videos with high visual and textual quality enables the T2V diffusion model to generate more detailed textures and better interpret textual input."

            "title": "3.2 Network Pruning",
            "content": "Model distillation [2123] is proven approach for reducing model size, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, it has not been widely explored in the context of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models. The main challenge lies in effectively transferring knowledge from large, high-performing model to smaller one without causing significant performance degradation. To overcome this, we introduce two-stage distillation framework designed specifically for T2V diffusion models. First Stage: The first step involves constructing smaller model by reducing the number of blocks by half in each layer and removing all middle blocks from the U-Net architecture. Maintaining structural similarity with the original model during this pruning process is essential to support better adaptation of diffusion priors and significantly accelerates training. We also explored various alternative architectural configurations and found that several pruned variants achieved comparable performance after fine-tuning. Based on these findings, we do not apply any task-specific architectural design at this stage. Taking VideoCrafter2 [2] as an example, which contains approximately 1.4 3 billion parameters, our pruned version reduces the parameter count to 0.7 billion. We then fine-tune the smaller model using the outputs of the original model as supervision, following by [24, 16, 25, 26]. The training details are listed below: The model is trained directly on the video outputs generated by the original model after classifier-free guidance (CFG) [27] is applied. We minimize the difference between adjacent points along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF ODE) trajectory using numerical solvers. Second Stage: The second stage focuses on further enhancing the visual quality of the Hummingbird diffusion model, with improvements in tonal range, color saturation, textural detail, and overall visual fidelity. straightforward approach would be to collect or synthesize additional video data that features high-quality visual effects. For example, some methods utilize video clips from professionally produced films, which benefit from high-end cinematography and extensive postproduction. However, acquiring such data is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and introduces practical limitations related to bandwidth usage and data availability. To address these challenges, we propose reusing the training data from the first stage to further improve visual quality. Inspired by [18], we leverage reward feedback from mixture of reward models to extract valuable visual cues from the existing dataset. This feedback-guided approach enables the model to refine fine-grained visual features without requiring new data. To enhance temporal coherence and visual consistency, we incorporate both image-text and video-text reward models during training. The second-stage training is highly efficient and requires only one GPU-day, utilizing four AMD Instinct MI250 GPUs with 64 GB of memory each."

            "content": "We train Hummingbird on the WebVid-10M [29] dataset. WebVid is publicly available, large-scale dataset consisting of 10 million video-text pairs collected from stock footage platforms. It features wide range of motion patterns and diverse scenes, making it suitable for general-purpose T2V training. subset of high-quality video data is selected using our proposed data processing pipeline for the first-stage training. For the second-stage training, smaller subset is randomly sampled from this selection. The first stage is trained for 200K steps with learning rate of 1 104 and batch size of 16. The second stage is trained for 80K steps with learning rate of 1 105 and batch size of 8. During training, we randomly sample 16 frames per video at resolution of 320 512, using dynamic frame stride. The frame rate condition varies depending on the codec of the original video. Training is conducted on AMD Instinct MI250 GPUs, which are based on the CDNA 2 architecture and feature 362.1 TFLOPs of peak FP16 performance, 64 GB of HBM2e memory, 3.2 TB/s peak memory bandwidth, and 500W TDP. The software stack includes Python 3.8, ROCm 5.6.0, PyTorch 2.2.0, and FlashAttention 2.2.0. It is worth noting that we also possess privately collected dataset that can further enhance model performance. However, due to licensing and privacy constraints, this dataset cannot be released. Therefore, all training for the public code release is conducted using the publicly available WebVid-10M dataset. Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the proposed method on the standard benchmark VBench [] which consists of 16 disentangled dimensions and is designed to comprehensively evaluate T2V models. Followed by [18], we also present the Quality Score and Semantic Score. The Quality Score is computed as weighted sum of seven normalized sub-metrics: Subject Consistency [30], Background Consistency [31], Temporal Flickering, Motion Smoothness [32], Aesthetic Quality [33], Dynamic Degree [34], and Image Quality [35]. The Semantic Score is obtained by averaging nine normalized sub-metrics: Object Class [36], Multiple Object [36], Human Action [37], Color [36], Spatial Relationship [38], Scene [39], Appearance Style [40], Temporal Style [40], and Overall Consistency [40]. The Total Score is then calculated as weighted sum of the Quality Score and Semantic Score, providing an overall measure of the models visual and semantic performance. 4 Table 1: VBench [28] Evaluation Results by Dimension.
