Introduction With recent advancements in generative models, text-toimage (TTI) models [2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 33, 36, 40] have significantly improved, enabling the generation of photorealistic images based on text prompts. Beyond generating images from text, these models support various text-based image tasks, including text-guided editing [11, 12, 16, 28, 48], text-guided style transfer [13, 38, 41], and subject-driven text-to-image generation [10, 20, 22, 26, 30, 31, 39, 45 47, 50]. Specifically, subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of specific subject in various contexts based on text prompt and reference image, while achieving both subject and text alignment. Early research on subject-driven text-to-image generation [10, 20, 39, 45] enables the model to synthesize new subject through fine-tuning on small set of images containing the target subject. While they achieve strong subject alignment via optimization, they are timeand resourceintensive, requiring hundreds of iterative steps of optimization for each new subject. As an alternative, zero-shot approaches [22, 26, 30, 31, 46, 47, 50] have emerged that do not require additional fine-tuning and instead utilize image prompting through specialized image encoder. These methods extract the image feature from reference image and integrate it into the TTI model alongside the text feature. While they achieve on-the-fly subject-driven text-toimage generation with single forward pass of the encoder, these encoder-based image prompting frameworks suffer from unsatisfactory subject alignment, particularly in capturing granular details. Recently, as models in NLP fields have been scaled up and demonstrated remarkable capabilities [1, 4], large-scale TTI models [8, 21] have similarly emerged. Notably, the recently released model, FLUX [21], has demonstrated exceptional text comprehension and the ability to effectively translate this understanding into images, even for highly complex and lengthy texts. Among the various capabilities of FLUX, we focus on its ability to generate highquality diptychstwo-paneled art pieces in which each panel contains an interrelated image. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), FLUXs advanced text understanding and high-resolution image generation enable it to generate side-by-side images of the same object, each reflecting different context as specified in the prompt for each panel. Motivated by FLUXs ability to generate diptychs, we propose Diptych Prompting, novel inpainting-based framework for zero-shot, subject-driven text-to-image generation. In our approach, we reinterpret the task as diptych inpainting process: the left panel contains reference image of the subject as visual cue, and the right panel is generated through inpainting based on text prompt describing the diptych with the desired context. Using text-conditioned diptych inpainting, Diptych Prompting aligns the generated image in the right panel with both the reference subject and the text prompt. We enhance this process by removing the background from the reference image to prevent content leakage and focus solely on the subject, and by enhancing attention weights between panels to ensure fine-grained details preservation. These two components enable Diptych Prompting to achieve more consistent, high-quality subjectdriven text-to-image generation."

            "content": "experiments, Diptych Prompting demonstrates superior performance over existing encoderbased image prompting methods, more effectively capturing both subject and text and producing results preferred by human evaluators. Additionally, our method is not limited to subjects; it can also be applied to styles, enabling stylized image generation [13, 38, 41] when personal style image is provided as reference. Furthermore, we showcase the extensibility of our approach to subject-driven image editing [49], allowing modification of specific regions in the target image with the reference subject. By arranging the target image in the right panel of diptych and masking only the region for editing in Diptych Prompting, we successfully integrate the reference subject into the target image. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach zero-shot subject-driven text-to-image generation as an inpainting task, offering new perspective by highlighting the diptych generation capabilities of FLUX. We propose two techniques to prevent content leakage and reliably capture details in the target subject: isolating the subject from its background and enhancing attention weights between panels. We validate our methods versatility and robustness, extending its effectiveness even to style-driven generation and subject-driven image editing through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative results. 2. Related Works 2.1. Diffusion-based Text-to-Image Models Diffusion models [15, 18, 42, 43] have led to significant advancements in TTI models, including GLIDE [29], LDM [36], DALL-E 2 [35], Imagen [40], and eDiff-I [2]. Among these, the Stable Diffusion (SD) series [8, 33, 36] has gained particular attention for its open-source nature and competitive performance to previous research. Starting with the v1 model, which utilizes U-Net [37] architecture with cross-attention for text, it evolved through v2 and then to SD-XL [33], with improvements in dataset scale, model architecture, resolution, and generation quality. Recently, generative model research [32] has achieved notable performance improvement by incorporating transformer [44] architectures into diffusion models instead of U-Net. Driven by this advancement, emerging studies now 2 integrate transformer architecture into TTI models, most notably SD-3 [8] and FLUX [21]. Both models employ the MultiModal-Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, an advanced design for TTI models that conducts joint attention on concatenated text and image embeddings, = [Qt; Qi], = [Kt; Ki], = [Vt; Vi], (cid:19) A(Q, K, ) = (Q, K)V = softmax (cid:18) QK (1) V, (2) where [; ] is the concatenation, Q, K, and represent the key components of attentionquery, key, and value, respectively; is the attention weight, and is the output of the attention. FLUX, in particular, is the largest-scale TTI model among open-source models and exhibits advanced performance in both text comprehension and image generation quality, surpassing previous open-source models. 2.2. Text-Conditioned Inpainting Image inpainting aims to fill the missing regions of an incomplete image using binary mask that specifies the areas to be reconstructed. Recent advancements in TTI models have led to the development of text-conditioned inpainting [49], which completes the missing regions to align not only with the visible region but also with text prompt, ˆI = Fθ(I, M, ), (3) where is the text describing the desired context, and Fθ is the generation process of the text-conditioned models. Various methods [43, 49] have been proposed to implement plausible Fθ from the pre-trained TTI models. While an early approach [43] employs pre-trained diffusion models without any further training, more recent works fine-tune the pre-trained TTI model or train additional modules [51] specifically for inpainting tasks. Through additional training for inpainting, these models achieve the two main objectives of text-conditioned inpainting: alignment with the visible regions in and alignment with the text prompt. Among various inpainting modules, ControlNet [51] equips FLUX with inpainting capability, providing inpainting-specific conditioning for enhanced control. By leveraging this module, we interpret inpainting as framework for subject-driven text-to-image generation. 2.3. Subject-Driven Image Generation There has been extensive research on subject-driven textto-image generation [10, 20, 22, 26, 30, 31, 39, 4547, 50], where the generated images not only render the various contexts described by the text prompt but also include the specific subject according to reference images. Subject-driven text-to-image generation is generally categorized into two groups based on whether they require additional training for each new subject. Figure 2. Diptych Generation Comparisons. We generate the diptych images with various TTI models from the following diptych text: diptych with two side-by-side images of same cat. On the left, photo of cat in front of Eiffel Tower. On the right, replicate this cat exactly but as photo of cat in the jungle. The first category [10, 20, 39, 45] involves fine-tuning on small set of subject images (e.g., 3-5 images) to learn the visual subject and how to generate it. While these methods achieve strong subject alignment through optimization on the subject, the fine-tuning requires retraining for each new subject, making them timeand resource-intensive. Moreover, optimizing on small set of images may lead to overfitting on the new subject and catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge which should be carefully prevented. The second group [22, 26, 30, 31, 46, 47, 50] addresses the limitations of the first by introducing image prompting, framework that incorporates reference image to guide the generated output. In this approach, specialized image enco der [34] is utilized to support an additional image input alongside the text prompt, allowing the diffusion model to capture the characteristics of the reference subject while adhering to the context described by the text prompt. This approach enables zero-shot subject-driven text-to-image generation; however, it often lacks fidelity in the synthesized subject. We propose novel inpainting-based zero-shot approach for subject-driven text-to-image generation using large-scale TTI model with an inpainting module. 3. Method 3.1. Diptych Generation of FLUX Diptych is an art term referring to two-paneled artwork in which two panels are displayed side by side, each containing interrelated content. Previous work, HQEdit [17], proposed pipeline for creating an image editing dataset in the form of diptychs using DALL-E 3 [3]. The strong text-image alignment of the large-scale TTI model, DALL-E 3, plays critical role in creating coherent editing pairs in the diptych. The recently released large-scale open-source TTI model, FLUX [21], demonstrates strong text comprehen3 Figure 3. (a) Overall Diptych Prompting Framework. Given the incomplete diptych Idiptych, text prompt Tdiptych describing the diptych, and the binary mask Mdiptych specifying the right panel as the inpainting target, FLUX with ControlNet module performs text-conditioned inpainting on the right panel while referencing the subject in the left panel. (b) Reference Attention Enhancement. To capture the granular details of the subject in left panel, we enhance the reference attention, an attention weight between the query of the right panel and the key of the left panel. sion and image generation capabilities, even surpassing DALL-E 3 [3]. Notably, its capabilities also extend to diptych generation: when we generate an image with diptych text Tdiptych, diptych with two side-by-side images of the same {object}. On the left, {description of left image}. On the right, replicate this {object} but as {description of right image}, FLUX synthesizes diptych image where the subjects in each panel are interrelated and each description of panel is accurately represented, as shown in Fig. 2. Generating high-quality diptych images requires the robust text-image alignment capability of large-scale TTI model, in which smaller models fall short. Compared to previous models such as SD-v2 [36], SD-XL [33], and SD3 [8], only FLUX [21] successfully synthesizes accurate diptych images that not only effectively interrelate subjects across panels but also render the correct contexts for each panel described in the diptych text. Therefore, we choose FLUX as the base model for our proposed methodology due to its superior ability to generate accurate and contextually aligned diptych images. 3.2. Diptych Prompting Framework For zero-shot subject-driven text-to-image generation, most approaches rely on specialized image encoder for image prompting that extracts image feature from reference image and integrates it into the TTI model. Instead, to inject detailed subject characteristics into the generated image in zero-shot manner, we propose novel prompting approach that reinterprets zero-shot method from the perspective of inpainting, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (a). Given the reference subject image and the target text prompt describing the desired context, Diptych Prompting begins with the triplets for inpainting-based prompting: an incomplete diptych image Idiptych, binary mask Mdiptych specifying the missing region, and diptych text Tdiptych. For the incomplete diptych image Idiptych, we concatenate two images along the width dimension with the left panel containing the reference subject image and the right panel consisting of blank image of the same size to be inpainted. We observe that simple diptych inpainting often results in excessive interrelation with the reference image by mirroring even subject-unrelated contents, such as background, pose, and location  (Fig. 4)  . To prevent this, we remove the background of the reference image through the background removal process Gseg using Grounding DINO [25] and Segment Anything Model (SAM) [19]. In this process, Grounding DINO uses the subject name to acquire bounding box of target subject through grounded object detection, and SAM performs subject segmentation with this detection box and removes the background, preparing it as the left panel, Idiptych = [Gseg(Iref); ]. (4) Additionally, our binary mask Mdiptych designates the location of the reference image in the left panel with zeros to provide visual cues, while marking the right panel with ones to indicate the missing areas to be filled, Mdiptych = [0hw; 1hw], (5) where 0hw and 1hw have the same size with each corresponding panel. For the diptych text Tdiptych describing the diptych configuration with desired context, we utilize the prompt template used in Sec. 3.1. From the target text prompt, we 4 the acquire From this, we attention weight (Q, K) as shown in Eq. (2), where (Q, K) R(lt+lli+lri)(lt+lli+lri), lt is the text sequence length, and li is sequence length of each panel in attention blocks as described in Fig. 3 (b). We enhance the reference attention, the attention weight between the query of right panel (Qri) and the key of left panel (Kli) by rescaling the submatrix (Qri, Kli) with λ > 1. Figure 4. Background Removal Effects. Simple diptych inpainting exhibits content leakage from the reference image, including background, pose, and location. We mitigate this unwanted leakage through background removal by Gseg. use the subject name of reference subject for object, resulting in the following final diptych text: diptych with two side-by-side images of same {subject name}. On the left, photo of {subject name}. On the right, replicate this {subject name} exactly but as {target text prompt}. Using these triplets, our Diptych Prompting performs the text-conditioned inpainting, ˆIdiptych = [Gseg(Iref); ˆIgen] = Fθ(Idiptych, Mdiptych, Tdiptych), (6) where ˆIgen represents the desired subject-driven image. 3.3. Reference Attention Enhancement Diptych Prompting reconstructs the right panel of the diptych by referencing the subject in the left panel. However, FLUX [21] with inpainting module often struggles to fully capture the fine details of the subject. Recent studies [7, 12, 13] have shown that the image generation process in U-Net-based TTI models can be controlled by manipulating key components of the attentionquery, key, value, and attention weightyet similar techniques remain largely unexplored in transformerbased architectures. Given that FLUX, built on the MMDiT architecture, incorporates more attention blocks than previous U-Net-based models, it offers greater potential for such control. In Diptych Prompting, we note that FLUX synthesizes both the reference and generated image simultaneously in diptych format through its attention blocks and computes the attention between the left and right panels. This leads us to enhance reference attentionthe influence of the left panel on the rightto better capture granular details of the reference subject. In the attention blocks of FLUX, the image feature part can be divided into two regions in diptych inpainting, corresponding to the left and right panel, = [Qt; Qli; Qri], = [Kt; Kli; Kri], (7) where ()t is the feature for text, ()li is for the left panel, and ()ri is for the right panel. 4. Experiments 4.1. Experimental Settings Implementation Details Our method is implemented based on the large-scale TTI model, FLUX-dev1, with the additional ControlNet-Inpainting module2. We perform diptych inpainting on canvas with an aspect ratio of 1:2, sized at 7681536, where the left half (768768) serves as the reference. During inference, the ControlNet conditioning scale is set to 0.95 and the reference attention rescaling parameter λ is set to 1.3 for diptych inpainting performed over 30 steps and guidance scale of 3.5 [14, 27]. Evaluations We measure zero-shot subject-driven text-toimage generation performance on DreamBench [39] that contains 30 subjects, each with 25 evaluation prompts. Following previous work [39], we generate 4 images per subject and prompt, resulting in total of 3000 images. These images are evaluated using the DINO [5] and CLIP [34]- based metrics which quantify the two objectives of subjectdriven text-to-image generation: subject alignment and text alignment. Subject alignment is measured by the average pairwise cosine similarity of features between generated images and real images using the DINO and CLIP image encoders (DINO, CLIP-I). Text alignment is measured by the pairwise cosine similarity between the CLIP image embeddings of the generated images and the CLIP text embeddings of the target texts (CLIP-T). 4.2. Baseline Comparisons We compare our method to previous zero-shot subjectdriven text-to-image methods with encoder-based image prompting, including ELITE [47], BLIP-Diffusion [22], Kosmos-G [30], Subject-Diffusion [26], IP-Adapter [50], MS-Diffusion [46], and λ-Eclipse [31]. The details of these models are provided in Appendix A. Qualitative Results Our qualitative results are presented in Fig. 5, where the reference images are at the leftmost column and generation results are at the right. Despite using an inpainting approach without any specialized training for subject-driven text-to-image generation, Diptych Prompting generates high-quality samples and accurate renderings 1FLUX.1-dev: https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev 2FLUX.1-dev-Controlnet-Inpainting-Beta: https://huggingface.co/alimama-creative/FLUX.1-dev-ControlnetInpainting-Beta 5 Figure 5.

Our method also demonstrates impressive performance in capturing the granular details of reference subjects, even with challenging examples containing characteristic fine details, such as monster toy or backpack. Human Preference Study We confirm the outstanding performance of our method in terms of human perception through human preference study. We conduct paired comparisons of our method with each baseline from two perspectives: subject alignment and text alignment. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected 450 responses from 150 participants for each baseline and each perspective. As shown in Tab. 1, Diptych Prompting outperforms all baselines by large margin (p < 0.01 in the Wilcoxon signedrank test), which is consistent with the qualitative results. Detailed information and full instructions about our human preference study are included in Appendix C. Quantitative Results For quantitative aspects, the comparison results are in Tab. 2. Diptych Prompting demonstrates comparable or superior performances in both subject alignment and text alignment, as measured by DINO and CLIPT scores. We also note that all baseline methods perform image prompting using the CLIP image encoder, resulting in high CLIP-I scores. In contrast, our inpainting-based zero-shot approach leverages the inherent generation capability of large-scale TTI model without specialized image encoder, which presents slight disadvantage in terms of CLIP-I. However, the results from other metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human evaluation studies across both aspects confirm the effective performance and robustness of our method. 4.3. Ablation Studies To analyze the factors contributing to the performance, we conduct in-depth ablation studies for Diptych Prompting.

However, using too high values introduces excessive inductive bias, causing abnormal attention weights that negatively impact performance. Qualitative transitions with respect to λ can be verified in Appendix F. 4.4. Applications With the strong capabilities demonstrated by Diptych Prompting, we also explore how it can be applied to tasks beyond subject-driven text-to-image generation. Stylized Image Generation We extend our method beyond subject images and perform stylized image generation using various style images as references. Using style images and prompts in StyleDrop [41], we employ Diptych Prompting as same, but replace the subject name with the term style in diptych text and without attention enhancement (λ = 1) for referencing only the stylistic elements except the content.

In this setup, we utilize Diptych Prompting with reference subject image, yet assign the right panel as the editing target image and apply the mask only to the region to be edited. Editing results are shown in Fig. 7. Owing to the capability of Diptych Prompting, edited images effectively preserve unmasked areas while seamlessly integrating the desired subject within the target region. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed Diptych Prompting, an inpainting-based approach for zero-shot subject-driven textto-image generation. Diptych Prompting performed textconditioned diptych inpainting: the left panel is reference image containing the subject, and the right panel is inpainted based on text prompt that describes the diptych containing the desired context. By removing the background and enhancing reference attention, we eliminated unnecessary content leakage and improved subject alignment. This innovative approach enjoyed the inherent properties of large-scale TTI models, achieving superior results over previous methods, particularly in accurately capturing target subjects and representing complex contexts. We also demonstrated the versatility of our method in stylized image generation and subject-driven image editing. Building on these contributions, we anticipate that Diptych Prompting will inspire new directions in image generation and across wide range of generative tasks, including video and 3D.

            "content": "A. Baselines We provide the details of the encoder-based image prompting baselines that we compared in human preference study, as well as in qualitative and quantitative evaluations. All of them utilize specialized image encoder which extracts image feature from the reference image and injects it into the TTI model. While these models train the specialized image encoder to enable image prompting for zero-shot subjectdriven text-to-image generation, they compromise subject alignment, especially in the granular details of the subject. For qualitative results and the human preference study, we compare our method only to the baselines with available open-source weights. ELITE3 [47] encodes the visual concepts into textual embeddings, leveraging global and local mapping networks to represent primary and auxiliary features separately, ensuring high fidelity and editability in subject-driven textto-image generation. BLIP-Diffusion4 [22] pre-trains multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 [23] which produces the text-aligned visual representation of the target subject, and learns the subject representation to enable the TTI model to perform efficient subject-driven text-to-image generation. Kosmos-G [30] aligns the output space of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with the CLIP [34] space by anchoring the text modality, and bridges the MLLM with frozen TTI model using AlignerNet and instruction tuning. As there are no available weights for this baseline, we cannot conduct the human preference study and can only compare using automatic quantitative metrics based on the values reported in their paper. Subject-Diffusion [26] utilizes an image encoder trained on their own large-scale subject-driven dataset to incorporate both coarse and fine-grained reference information into the pre-trained TTI model, enabling high-fidelity subject-driven text-to-image generation without test-time fine-tuning. Subject-Diffusion also has no available opensource weights, so we only conduct the quantitative comparisons with their reported values in the paper. λ-Eclipse5 [31] employs CLIP-based latent space and image-text interleaved pre-training and contrastive loss to project text and image embeddings into unified space, preserving subject-specific visual features and reflecting the target text prompt. MS-Diffusion6 [46] introduces layout-guided framework for multi-subject zero-shot subject-driven text-to3ELITE: https://github.com/csyxwei/ELITE 4BLIP-Diff: https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blipdiffusion image generation by employing grounding resampler for detailed feature integration and multi-subject crossattention mechanism to ensure spatial control and mitigate subject conflicts. IP-Adapter7 8 [50] trains an effective lightweight adapter to enable image prompting for pre-trained TTI models, using decoupled cross-attention mechanism with separate cross-attention layers for text and image prompts. At the time the IP-Adapter paper was released, SD-v1.5 [36] was used; however, more recent versions, including SDXL [33], SD-3 [8], and FLUX [21], have since been made available. For quantitative comparisons, we referenced the results for the SD-XL version from another study [31], while we conducted our own evaluations for the FLUX version to ensure fair comparison. In all experiments using IP-Adapter, regardless of the base model version, the conditioning scale is set to 0.6. B. Subject-Driven Text-to-Image Generation B.1. Evaluation Setting We conduct the main comparisons with baselines on 30 subjects in DreamBench [39]. These consist of 21 objects and 9 live subjects, with 25 evaluation prompts for the objects or live subjects. Diptych Prompting uses the subject name to refer to the target subject and utilizes evaluation prompts that include the subject name for the target description in diptych text. In all zero-shot baselines and our method, we enhance the subject names by adding descriptive modifiers to more accurately refer to the target subjects in the text prompt. The subject names for each subject are summarized as follows in the form of (directory name, subject name): backpack, backpack backpack dog, backpack bear plushie, bear plushie berry bowl, Bon appetit bowl can, Transatlantic IPA can candle, jar candle cat, tabby cat cat2, grey cat clock, number 3 clock colorful sneaker, colorful sneaker dog1, fluffy dog dog2, fluffy dog dog3, curly-haired dog dog5, long-haired dog dog6, puppy dog7, dog dog8, dog duck toy, duck toy fancy boot, fringed cream boot 5λ-Eclipse: https://github.com/eclipse-t2i/lambda-eclipse-inference 6MS-Diff: https://github.com/MS-Diffusion/MS-Diffusion 7IP-Adapter (SD-XL): https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter 8IP-Adapter (FLUX): https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-ip-adapter Figure A1.

Comparison with Fine-Tuning-Based Method To provide more comprehensive comparison, we also compare with DreamBooth [39], representative finetuning-based method. For efficient training, we attach LoRA adapter to the pre-trained FLUX and perform finetuning by training only the LoRA adapter while freezing the FLUX. We train for 300 steps using the Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1 104. Additionally, to compare different fine-tuning model capacities, we adjusted the rank of the LoRA adapter and conducted comparative experiments using the same metrics (DINO, CLIP-I, CLIPT). The results are presented in Fig. A1, where our Diptych Prompting demonstrates superior performance across various model capacities. B.3. Additional Results We include additional samples of Diptych Prompting in Fig. A2 and Fig. A3 for diverse objects and contexts. As demonstrated in the results, our methodology achieves highquality image generation and satisfies both subject alignment and text alignment in zero-shot manner by leveraging FLUXs capabilities. Notably, this is accomplished without any specialized training for subject-driven text-toimage generation. We also note that the fine details in the target subject are well reflected in the generated results, even for challenging subjects that previous zero-shot methods struggled with (e.g., robot toy, Bon appetit bowl). 13 C. Human Preference Study Following the previous work [39], we perform the human preference study by pairwise comparison in two separate questionnaires for each aspect: subject alignment and text alignment. In both questionnaires, users are presented with reference image, target text, and two images generated by each method. They are then asked to select which image better satisfies the desired objective according to the following instructions. For subject alignment: Inspect the reference subject and then inspect the generated subjects. Select which of the two generated items reproduces the identity (item type and details) of the reference item The subject might be wearing accessories (e.g., hats, outfits). These should not affect your answer. Do not take them into account. If youre not sure, select Cannot Determine / Both Equally. Which Machine-Generated Image best matches the subject of the reference image? For text alignment: Inspect the target text and then inspect the generated items. Select which of the two generated items is best described by the target text. If youre again not sure, select Cannot Determine / Both Equally. Which Machine-Generated Image is best described by the reference text? D. Diptych Generation Our framework relies on the emerging property of the largescale TTI model, FLUX, particularly its strong understanding of diptych property and the ability to represent diptych accurately. We verify this by synthesizing total of 2100 diptychs, using 20 objects, each with pair of two random prompts for each panel among 15 prompts, and comparing the diptych generation performance with those of other previous TTI models. The prompt for diptych generation folModel Arch Param DINO CLIP-I CLIP-T Method DINO CLIP-I CLIP-T SD-v2 U-Net SD-XL U-Net SD-3 MM-DiT FLUX MM-DiT 1.2B 3.5B 7.7B 16.9B 0.504 0.941 0.705 0.720 0.744 0.954 0.821 0.828 0.260 0.288 0.340 0.352 Table A1. Diptych Generation Comparisons. Quantitative comparisons of the diptych generation capabilities of various TTI models based on the total number of parameters, including the autoencoder, main network, and text encoder. lows the setup mentioned in Sec. 3.1 of the main paper. We assessed the quality of each diptych by evaluating the interrelation and text alignment of each panel. This is measured through splitting the generated image in half and measuring DINO and CLIP-I scores between each panel, as well as the CLIP-T score between each panel and its description. The results are shown in Tab. A1, in which the diptych generation performance and total number of parameters including the autoencoder, main network, and text encoders are reported. These results exhibit the superior diptych generation capability of FLUX, where smaller models are insufficient. This allows us to extend to inpainting and propose zero-shot subject-driven text-to-image generation method via diptych inpainting-based interpretation. E. Background Removal Ablation We provide additional samples for the ablation study conducted with and without the background removal process Gseg in Fig. A4. Consistent with the findings in the main paper, including the background leads to content leakage, where irrelevant elements such as background, pose, and location are mirrored in the generated results. This hinders the accurate reflection of the desired context described by the text and reduces diversity in pose and location. In contrast, removing the background and retaining only the subject information in the reference image on the left panel allows the generated outputs to better align with the desired context while exhibiting greater diversity in pose and location. F. Reference Attention Enhancement Ablation We further present the actual sample quality variations according to the reference attention rescaling factor λ values to support the quantitative ablations in the main paper. These variations are visualized in Fig. A5. As seen in the qualitative results, the absence of reference attention enhancement (λ = 1.0) can lead to loss of fine details of the subject, resulting in subtle discrepancies such as the left eye of the backpack dog, the patch on its right eye, the fur color on the dogs face, or the texture of the bear plushies fur. As the λ value increases, these missed details are betRB-Mod [38] IP-Adapter [50] Diptych Prompting 0.295 0.337 0.357 0.598 0.602 0. 0.372 0.371 0.349 Table A2. Stylized Image Generation Comparisons. Quantitative comparisons of stylized image generation with previous zeroshot methods. ter preserved, leading to improved subject alignment performance. However, excessive enhancement can negatively impact the quality of the generated images, causing the subject to appear slightly blurred or exhibit minor color shifts. G. Stylized Image Generation For stylized image generation, Diptych Prompting places the style image in the left panel and inpaints the right panel using the text prompt diptych with two side-byside images of same style. On the left, {original image description}. On the right, replicate this style exactly but as {target image description} without attention enhancement (λ = 1.0) for referencing only the stylistic elements except the content. Additional samples are provided in Fig. A6. Beyond the qualitative results, we also include quantitative comparisons using the same metrics (DINO, CLIPT, CLIP-I) applied to total of 2000 generated images in Tab. A2. These images include 4 samples per prompt and per style image, across 25 prompts and 20 style images collected from previous work [41]. As shown in the result, our method demonstrates comparable results to existing zeroshot style transfer methods specialized in stylized image generation, further proving the versatility of our approach. H. Subject-Driven Image Editing Diptych Prompting is extended to the subject-driven image editing by placing the reference subject image on the left panel and the editing target image on the right panel in the incomplete diptych. By masking only the desired area in the right panel and applying diptych inpainting, the reference subject from the left panel is generated in the masked region on the right panel, resulting in the subject-driven image editing. Following the previous work [49], we conduct the subject-driven image editing with selected images from subset of the MSCOCO [24] validation dataset, in which each image contains bounding box and the bounding box is smaller than half of image size. We applied masking to the inside of the bounding box, enabling the generation of the reference subject within the specified region. More samples of various subjects and editing target images are available in Fig. A7. 14 I. Limitations Currently, FLUX is the only model with sufficient capability to effectively generate diptychs. However, as more advanced text-to-image (TTI) models become available, we anticipate that our method will be applicable to wider range of models in the future. In line with advancements in other encoder-based zero-shot approaches, there is need to explore multi-subject-driven text-to-image generation. We leave this exploration for future work. Furthermore, diptych generation requires the generated image to have an aspect ratio of 2 : 1. Due to the limitation in the generatable resolution of FLUX, we were unable to produce the diptych image at size of 2048 1024 pixels and confirmed results up to 1536 768 pixels, resulting in subject-driven image (right panel) being 768 768 pixels in size. We expect that this issue can be easily addressed by utilizing super-resolution models such as ControlNet [51] or advanced TTI models for high-resolution image generation in the future. 15 Figure A2.
