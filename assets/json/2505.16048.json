            "content": "LLMs have achieved strong performance on linguistic and logical tasks, but their ability to reason about physical systems and spatial structures remains poorly evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, existing benchmarks do not require models to infer relationships governed by geometry and force distribution, limiting our evaluation of deeper spatial-physical reasoning capabilities. p.d.siedler@gmail.com. 2Huggingface Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/philippds/SPhyR Data Generation and Model Evaluation Code: https://github.com/philippds/SPhyR Preprint. Under review. Spatial and physical reasoning benchmarks introduce constraints that cannot be solved through pattern matching alone. Tasks involving material arrangement and force flow demand that models reason about support placement, forces, connectivity and structure under real-world conditions. Evaluating LLMs in this setting provides clearer view of their generalization abilities and highlights gaps between language-based learning and the grounded reasoning required for interaction with physical environments. Topology optimization provides natural benchmark for spatial and physical reasoning. They require determining the optimal material distribution within given domain under specific force and support conditions, balancing structural stability and material efficiency. Unlike traditional physics problems that often focus on numerical prediction, topology optimization demands reasoning about geometry, connectivity, and force flow simultaneously. This combination forces models to integrate spatial layout with physical constraints, presenting challenges that purely language-based tasks do not capture. In this work, we introduce new dataset for evaluating spatial and physical reasoning in LLMs, based on topology optimization tasks. We provide range of 2D challenges, from masked region completion to full material distribution prediction tasks, grounded solely in boundary conditions, forces, and supports. We provide results with existing SOTA LLMs and highlight key challenges that arise when models are tasked with reasoning beyond language into structured physical domains."

The goal is to produce structures that maximize performance metrics, typically minimizing compliance (maximizing stiffness) while using the least amount of material. The resulting solutions exhibit highly structured patterns that balance material connectivity, load paths, and spatial efficiency. In this work, we repurpose topology optimization problems as reasoning tasks for LLMs. Rather than solving the optimization numerically, models are challenged to predict or complete plausible material distributions based solely on the specified forces, supports, and boundary. This formulation requires models to infer structural principles such as load transfer, stability, and efficient use of material, without access to physical simulation engines. 3."

First, models must infer how forces propagate through the structure, deciding where material is necessary to maintain stability and support loads. This involves understanding force paths, support connectivity, and load transferconcepts that are rarely encountered in typical LLM training data. Second, models must reason spatially about the layout of material across 2D grid. Predicting plausible completions requires local coherence (e.g., avoiding isolated material islands) as well as global structural organization (e.g., maintaining continuous load paths from forces to supports). Moreover, models must solve these tasks without explicit simulation tools or numerical methods. Instead, they must generalize from the provided boundary conditions and partial observations, synthesizing structures that satisfy implicit physical constraints. These reasoning demands span from local (individual cells or lines) to global (complete structures), creating rich and graded challenge space for evaluating LLM capabilities beyond language-based tasks."

Millipede enables the simulation of material distribution under given boundary conditions using density-based optimization methods. We constructed set of 2D samples by varying the positions of applied forces and supports. Applied forces and supports were systematically placed to create diverse loading scenarios. In this work we focused on load-support scenarios that can be found most likely in building structural scenarios, that is, load from the top, support on the bottom. We introduce one support and load location for each scenario, ranging from 3 to 6 cells in width. Each optimization was performed until 10 iterations, resulting in plausible material distributions optimized for stiffness and material efficiency. By leveraging the flexibility of Grasshopper and Millipede, we ensured substantial variation across samples, including different structural typologies and support-force relationships. This variability is crucial for creating tasks that require generalization beyond memorization of fixed patterns."

Known material or void regions are explicitly represented using binary values (1 for solid material, 0 for empty space). The prompt also includes clear instructions emphasizing structural plausibility and material efficiency, along with serialized 10 10 grid where each row appears on separate line and cell values are space-separated.

In \"easy\" variants, the ground truth material distribution is binary, focusing on high-level structural placement and discrete spatial reasoning.

These metrics are designed to capture both perfect completions and partial correctness relative to the structural ground truth. Exact Match is binary metric indicating whether the models output exactly matches the ground truth in all masked regions. prediction receives an Exact Match score of 1 if no errors are present, and 0 otherwise. Score quantifies how close the predicted output is to the ground truth, relative to the number of differences between the raw input and the ground truth. Specifically, it is computed as the proportion of masked region errors corrected by the model: Score = 1 differences count between model output and ground truth differences count between input and ground truth . score of 1 indicates perfect correction of all masked regions, while score below 0 implies that the model introduced more errors than it corrected. Normalized Score is clipped version of Score, with lower bound of 0, ensuring interpretability on [0, 1] scale even when the model degrades the input: Normalized Score = max(0, Score). Together, these metrics capture whether model achieves perfect reconstruction, how effectively it improves over the incomplete input, and how reliably it avoids introducing additional errors. In addition to these quantitative metrics, we also perform qualitative analysis by visually inspecting predicted outputs for structural plausibility, focusing on factors such as load path continuity, material efficiency, and connectivity."

Results show that performance generally decreases with task difficulty, with \"easy\" tasks yielding higher scores than \"hard\" ones. Exact matches are rare, but moderate Normalized Scores indicate that models often make meaningful partial corrections. Localized tasks, such as single-cell or row completions, are consistently easier than full-structure prediction, which remains highly challenging for all models. Row tasks tend to outperform column tasks, suggesting directional bias or easier contextual inference.

Notably, while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks first in overall performance on overall tasks, it frequently modifies the existing (non-masked) structure more than necessary, indicating tendency to overwrite rather than extend the original design. However, we observe several common failure modes across models: they sometimes predict disconnected structures, resulting in isolated material islands that would not carry load effectively; they may also overbuild regions, producing dense material clusters without regard to force flow; and, particularly in hard and 3D tasks, they frequently underbuild or omit critical connections, failing to maintain continuous paths from force application points to supports. Representative examples of model successes and failures can be found in the Appendix B."

            "title": "7 Discussion",
            "content": "The quantitative and qualitative results highlight key challenges for large language models in spatial and physical reasoning tasks. While models demonstrate some ability to predict local material placements in simple scenarios, performance drops significantly for harder masked completions and full structure predictions. Typical errors, such as disconnected or overbuilt regions, suggest that current LLMs struggle to internalize fundamental physical concepts like load path continuity and material efficiency without explicit simulation or physics grounding. Our benchmark thus exposes critical gap between the impressive linguistic and logical reasoning abilities of current models and their limited understanding of structured, physics-governed environments. Bridging this gap will likely require new architectures, training strategies, or hybrid systems that integrate physical priors into model reasoning processes. These findings suggest both opportunities and limitations for applying LLMs to engineering and design workflows. On the positive side, models that generate plausible partial completions may support early-stage ideation or assist in localized edits. However, their tendency to modify existing, unmasked structures highlights potential risk in applications where preserving prior design elements or structural validity is essential."

            "title": "NeurIPS Paper Checklist",
            "content": "1. Claims Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the papers contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Abstract and Introduction sections. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This can be found in the Discussion section. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. The authors are encouraged to create separate \"Limitations\" section in their paper. The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on few datasets or with few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that arent acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. Theory assumptions and proofs Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] 32 Justification: Quantitative, qualitative analysis are provided as well as full results: https: //github.com/philippds/SPhyR/tree/main/results. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced. All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide short proof sketch to provide intuition. Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 4. Experimental result reproducibility Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All code to generate data and re-run evaluation can be found in the provided repository: https://github.com/philippds/SPhyR. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. If the paper includes experiments, No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. If the contribution is dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to hosted model (e.g., in the case of large language model), releasing of model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is new model (e.g., large language model), then there should either be way to access this model for reproducing the results or way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results. 5. Open access to data and code 33 Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All code to generate data and re-run evaluation can be found in the provided repository: https://github.com/philippds/SPhyR. Data is available in the provided HuggingFace Dataset repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/philippds/ SPhyR. Guidelines: The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so No is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for new open-source benchmark). The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. 6. Experimental setting/details Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is benchmark dataset. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material. 7. Experiment statistical significance Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: Does not apply. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. 34 The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to library function, bootstrap, etc.) The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report 2-sigma error bar than state that they have 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. 8. Experiments compute resources Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All information on hardware and API use has been provided in the paper. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didnt make it into the paper). 9. Code of ethics Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: - Guidelines: The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require deviation from the Code of Ethics. The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction). 10. Broader impacts Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: Out of scope for this benchmark dataset. Guidelines: The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. 35 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). 11. Safeguards Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is benchmark dataset. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. Released models that have high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make best faith effort. 12. Licenses for existing assets Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: - Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include URL. The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. For scraped data from particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of dataset. 36 For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the assets creators. 13. New assets Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Additional documentation on the dataset and code to generate data as well as evaluate can be found in the respective repositories on GitHub or HuggingFace provided. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Does not apply. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Does not apply. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. 37 For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review. 16. Declaration of LLM usage Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required. Answer: [NA] Justification: Does not apply. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components. Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) for what should or should not be described."
