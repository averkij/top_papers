            "content": "Understanding the socioeconomic characteristics of urban regions is fundamental to the planning, management, and sustainability of cities. Urban socioeconomic sensing, the process of quantifying indicators such as income, education, health, and transport conditions across spatial units, plays critical role in shaping how cities function and evolve. These indicators directly influence residents quality of life and are deeply intertwined with key aspects of urban inequality, mobility, and resource allocation. Moreover, urban socioeconomic data serves as cornerstone for measuring progress toward several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Accurate and timely information on urban disparities is essential for tracking these goals and designing effective interventions. In practice, governments and urban planners rely on socioeconomic indicators to inform wide range of decisionsfrom zoning regulations and infrastructure investment to public health strategies. better understanding of spatially resolved urban indicators empowers decision-makers to allocate resources more equitably, respond to local needs, and promote inclusive urban development. growing body of work has explored the use of classical deep learning methods to predict urban socioeconomic indicators. Some approaches, such as [49], leverage knowledge graphs to infer socioeconomic indicators. In parallel, researchers have explored the use of urban imagery to understand cities through their visual appearance. Methods such as [23], [27], [25], and [44] employ contrastive learning to generate visual representations from street view or satellite images, while others like [14] apply basic computer vision models to extract visual features. However, the classical methods face several key limitations, including difficulty in handling unstructured or multi-modal data, the inability to work across multiple countries, and cannot interpret subjective and culturally significant aspects Preprint. Under review. of place. Nevertheless, Large Language-Vision Models are inherently equipped to address these challenges with their ability to integrate multiple modalities, generalize globally, and interpret cultural nuances. In recent years, researchers have begun to leverage LLVMs and large language models (LLMs) to address some of the limitations of classical approaches. For example, [43] and [17] employ LLVM to generate textual descriptions from urban imagery, effectively introducing textual modality to enrich visual understanding. Other studies, such as [29] and [28], explore the ability of LLMs to predict socioeconomic indicators directly through textual prompts, and further examine issues like geographical bias across different countries. Despite these promising advances, existing works still fall short in several key aspects. Most efforts are limited in terms of spatial coverage, indicator diversity, and multi-modal integration. Crucially, there remains lack of systematic and unified benchmark to comprehensively evaluate how LLVMs perform across tasks, regions, and modalities in the context of urban socioeconomic sensing. To address these limitations, we propose CityLens, comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large vision-language models to predict urban socioeconomic indicators using both street view and satellite imagery. CityLens spans total of 17 cities across multiple continents, covering 11 indicators across 6 socioeconomic domains, including economy, health, education, environment, transport, and crime. By integrating diverse data modalities and global geographic coverage, CityLens enables systematic, cross-task, and cross-region evaluation of LLVMs capabilities in urban perception, geo-visual reasoning, and numerical estimation. Overall, our contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce CityLens, multi-modal benchmark for urban socioeconomic sensing. It is built through scalable data collection and processing pipeline, covering 17 cities across different continents, 11 indicators in 6 socioeconomic domains, using both street view and satellite imagery. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art large vision-language models across diverse tasks and evaluation settings, systematically comparing three paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Estimation, and Feature-Based Regression. We provide detailed empirical analyses that offer new insights into how different prompting strategies, input modalities, and task types affect model performance, highlighting challenges, opportunities, and future directions for socioeconomic sensing with LLVMs."

Under the economy domain, we cover 7 critical indicators: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), house price, population, median household income, poverty 100%, poverty 200%, and income Gini coefficient. In the transport domain, we include seven indicators: PMT, VMT, PTRP, VTRP, walk and bike ratio, public transport ratio, and drive ratio. In the crime domain, we focus on two indicator: violent crime incidence and non-violent crime incidence, both defined as the number of crime occurrences per census tract. For the health domain, we include 9 kinds of indicators to capture different dimensions of urban health outcomes: obesity, diabetes, cancer, no leisre-time physical activity(LPA), mental health, physical health, depression rate, accessibility to 2 Figure 1: Framework of CityLens. healthcare, and life expectancy. In the environment domain, we consider two indicators: carbon emissions and building height. Building height is increasingly used as an explicit yet indirect indicator of urban socioeconomic development, population density, and land use intensity. Under the education domain, following [27], we use the bachelor ratio, defined as the proportion of residents holding bachelors degree or higher, as the target variable. These domains are selected to ensure balanced and holistic representation of urban conditions that are commonly studied in social science and urban planning."

We choose New York, San Francisco, and Chicago in the US, and Leeds, Liverpool, and Birmingham in the UK. For globally available indicators, we expand coverage to cities across 6 continents, including: Cape Town, Nairobi, London, Paris, Beijing, Shanghai, Moscow, Mumbai, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Sydney, which ensures cross-regional evaluation diversity. Beyond ground-truth indicator data, we collect both satellite images and street view images for each task region. We obtain street view images for Beijing and Shanghai using the Baidu Maps API, while for other cities, we utilize the Google Street View API. Additionally, satellite images are downloaded from Esri World Imagery, providing zoom level 15 images for all cities in our study."

The selection followed two principles: First, we assess the perceptual relevance of indicators i.e., whether human could reasonably infer the variable from satellite and street view imagery. Indicators such as Estimated personal miles traveled on working weekday, which lack visible spatial cues, are excluded. Second, we conduct Pearson correlation analysis among semantically similar indicators in the same domain to remove redundancy. For example, in the health domain, we found high correlation between obesity and mental health (Pearsons = 0.7524), which is intuitively understandable that people experiencing psychological stress or poor mental well-being tend to overeat or engage in unhealthy eating behaviors. To avoid task redundancy, we retained only mental health in the final task list. 3 Figure 2: Benchmark Construction Pipeline, including data collection, indicator selection, task construction and evaluation method."

            "title": "2.1.4 Task Construction",
            "content": "For US-only indicators, we define census tract level prediction tasks. Each census tract is represented by one satellite image and 10 street view images, which are jointly input into the LLVM for prediction. While prior work such as [14] uses 20 or more street view images to represent each region, we found that this setup is often impractical for LLVMs. Specifically, we initially experiment with 20 street view images per region, but observe that this would significantly increase the computational cost, and exceed the input limits of models like Gemini, which can only process up to 10 images per inference, and also frequently hit the token length limit of other models. Therefore, we adopt compromise of 10 images per region to ensure compatibility across models while maintaining sufficient visual context. For UK-only indicators, tasks are constructed at the MSOA level using similar strategy. For global tasks, we first download multiple satellite images covering each citys spatial extent. Then, we randomly sample 30 geographic points within the satellite image coverage, downloading at least 10 street view images for those points. Each satellite image is paired with its local indicator value to form an evaluation unit. For the China house price task, we follow the global task methodology and select Beijing and Shanghai as target cities. Due to resource constraints, we randomly sample up to 500 cases per task for country-specific indicators, and up to 1000 cases per task for global indicators. In practice, some tasks contain fewer samples due to data availability limitations, but these values represent the maximum sample size allowed per task. The detailed statistics of available data before applying the sampling strategy are presented in Figure 3b.

For each region, we represent its visual environment using 10 sampled street view images. For each visual feature, we compute the average score across these images, resulting in single feature vector that characterizes the region. These aggregated visual features are then used as inputs to LASSO regression model, which is trained to predict the corresponding ground-truth indicator values using 5-fold cross-validation setup."

In particular, tasks such as Mental Health and Bachelor Ratio exhibit low R2 scores, in some cases even approaching zero, e.g., 0.001. This highlights the difficulty of CityLens in Feature-Based Regression method: even when leveraging visual features extracted by advanced LLVMs, the resulting representations often fail to capture the complex patterns required for accurate prediction of socioeconomic indicators, especially in domains like health and education, where visual cues are often subtle, noisy, or indirect."

            "content": "We observe substantial performance differences across LLVMs, reflecting how model scale, architecture, and training design influence their ability to extract meaningful visual features for downstream prediction. Comparing models within the same series but at different scales, we find that increasing model size does not always guarantee better performance. For example, Gemma3-12B achieves the best score on GDP and Life Expectancy, yet the 27B variant, despite its larger size, performs worse in these two tasks, with relative drops of 4.3% and 6.8% respectively. This counterintuitive result may be attributed to the unique nature of socioeconomic sensing tasks, which requires the model to consistently extract and score predefined set of nuanced visual features from urban imagery. When comparing models from different series with similar parameter scales, clear differences emerge. For instance, Gemma3-4B significantly outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B in nearly all tasks, with relative improvements ranging from 6.4% to 255% across different indicators, suggesting that Gemmas architecture or training process may enable more consistent and informative scoring of urban visual features, which in turn leads to better performance in downstream socioeconomic prediction."

Tasks like Building Height, Public Transport, and GDP tend to have relatively higher values across models, with Building Height reaching an R2 of 0.59, suggesting that these indicators are associated with more observable visual cues that can be directly captured from street view images. For instance, Building Height is closely linked to the skyline and the vertical structure visible in images; Public Transport usage may be inferred from the presence of bus stops, transit signs, or road markings. In contrast, tasks such as Life Expectancy and Mental Health remain highly challenging, exhibiting low or near-zero predictive scores for many models. 6 These indicators are influenced by latent factors such as lifestyle, stress levels, or social cohesion, which do not have clear or direct visual manifestations in the urban environment. Even if certain proxies exist, such as the presence of graffiti or the amount of green space, they are often subtle or semantically ambiguous, making it difficult for current LLVMs to interpret them reliably and consistently."

            "content": "We evaluate the performance of large language-vision models on all 11 tasks using both the Direct Metric Prediction and Normalized Estimation settings. To ensure robustness of the analysis, any data point for which either the simple or normalized R2 is less than or equal to 0.5 is excluded, as such values generally reflect weak predictive performance and are not analytically meaningful. The final comparison is visualized in Figure 4. few tasks such as House Price, Public Transport, and Building Height achieve relatively better R2 scores under certain models and settings, e.g., House Price consistently exceeds 0.2 under the Direct setting. These tasks are likely more visually grounded, with cues such as building density, road layout, and commercial signage that can be directly observed from urban imagery. This suggests that some socioeconomic indicators may be approximated more easily when the visual-structural link is strong. However, the majority of results fall into the low or even negative R2 range, indicating that the models predictions often fail to explain the variance in the ground-truth indicator values. This suggests that, while large language-vision models have made rapid progress in perception and reasoning, predicting regionlevel socioeconomic indicators remains highly challenging and underexplored task. The models may still lack the necessary numerical grounding, contextual interpretation, and semantic alignment required to associate urban visual content with structured socioeconomic quantities. Even with normalization, which alleviates the demand for precision by coarsening the prediction space, performance remains weak across most tasks. In many cases, the model predictions tend to collapse toward city-wide averages or exhibit narrow output range, suggesting lack of sensitivity to fine-grained regional variation. This behavior indicates that the models may struggle to differentiate subtle socio-spatial differences across urban regions, especially when visual cues are weak or ambiguous. These findings highlight the inherent difficulty of the CityLens benchmark; models struggle not only when asked to predict exact values, but also when the task is simplified into normalized estimation. We also incorporate the Feature-Based Regression method into unified evaluation. comprehensive comparison across all three paradigms is visualized in Appendix Figure 9.

            "content": "In Figure 4, the diagonal line indicates equal performance under both methods; points above it suggest that the task benefits more from normalization, while points below indicate preference for direct estimation. This result highlights that different tasks tend to favor different estimation strategies, depending on the nature of the indicator and its visual and semantic properties. Specifically, tasks such as Violent Crime, GDP, and Population are more frequently observed above the diagonal, suggesting that these indicators with limited direct visual correspondence benefit from normalized formulation that emphasizes relative ranking rather than precise value prediction. These tasks are difficult to estimate accurately, but models may still capture coarse ordinal relationships across regions, aided by their global knowledge priors and implicit ranking sense. Conversely, tasks like Bachelor Ratio, House Price, Public Transport, and Accessibility to Health tend to fall below 7 (a) (b) (c) Figure 5: (a) shows the results of the GDP prediction task across 13 different cities. (b) presents the results showing that satellite imagery has limited impact on prediction. (c) demonstrates that increasing the number of street view images leads to progressive improvement in predictive performance. the diagonal, indicating better performance under the direct estimation setting. These tasks are often associated with clearer, more stable visual correlates, such as building types, infrastructure visibility, and environmental layout, which can support more precise image-to-value mappings. In addition, some indicators, e.g., Life Expectancy, exhibit narrower value ranges or lower variance, making them more amenable to direct value prediction. Moreover, for tasks like House Price and Bachelor Ratio, LLVMs may leverage latent knowledge about typical value scales across different cities, enabling surprisingly accurate numerical predictions. Taken together, these findings emphasize the importance of task-specific method selection in socioeconomic indicator prediction. Some indicators benefit from reducing output precision to focus on broader distinctions, while others retain enough visual signal to support direct prediction. The CityLens benchmark thus not only tests model capacity, but also reveals the nuanced interplay between task semantics and prediction strategy."

Cities such as Shanghai, San Francisco, and Sao Paulo achieve R2 scores above 0.43, indicating relatively strong predictive performance. One possible explanation for the strong performance in cities like Shanghai lies in their well-structured urban design and high alignment between street-level appearance and economic development. These cities tend to have clear visual stratification between affluent and less affluent areas, consistent architectural patterns and homogeneous zoning that make features more learnable and high quality, diverse street view coverage. In contrast, cities like Mumbai and Moscow yield near-zero or even negative R2, which may be attributed to two key factors. First, there may be weak alignment between street-level visuals and actual economic activity, especially in cities with spatially mixed development, where wealth and poverty coexist within the same region, blurring the visual economic signal. Second, the quality and coverage of street view images can be limiting factor. Inconsistent image sources, low resolution, or sparse sampling reduce the availability of reliable visual cues, hindering feature extraction and degrading downstream prediction."

We test 3 tasks: House price, Public transport, and Drive ratio using Gemini-2.0-Flash under the Direct Metric Prediction setting. As shown in Figure 5b, the results reveal minimal performance differences between the two configurations, which appears counterintuitive given the common assumption that satellite imagery can provide high-level spatial cues, such as regional development intensity, land use, and urban rural gradient, which are potentially informative for socioeconomic prediction. One possible explanation is that street view imagery 8 already provides sufficiently rich and fine-grained visual information, like building conditions and public infrastructure. These ground-level features may be more directly interpretable by current large language-vision models and more tightly coupled with the target indicators in these tasks. As result, the one additional satellite image may offer redundant or less impactful information, leading to negligible performance gains."

In this experiment, each region is represented by one satellite image and varying number of street view images: 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. The results are shown in Figure 5c. In addition, we test no-image baseline following the design in [29], where only the geographic coordinates and address are provided in the prompt without any visual input. In this setting, most responses from the model consist of refusals, indicating that the model lacks sufficient information to generate confident estimate. Interestingly, in several cases, the model proactively suggests alternatives, such as checking local housing websites, demonstrating the LLVMs conversational safety and reasoning abilities, but also its limitation in open-world knowledge retrieval. From the results, we observe clear trend: increasing the number of street view images consistently improves model performance. As more images are included, R2 increases and nRMSE decreases. This suggests that richer visual context helps the model form more accurate understanding of the regions socioeconomic condition."

            "content": "A growing number of studies have attempted to predict socioeconomic indicators in urban environments, using diverse technical strategies. [49] and [27] employ knowledge graph based approaches to support socioeconomic inference. Li et al. [23] propose contrastive learning framework based on structural urban imagery to support socioeconomic indicator prediction. Fan et al. [14] extract urban visual features from street view imagery using computer vision model, applying them to predict socioeconomic indicators at scale across U.S. cities. Recent approaches have extended this paradigm to multi-modal vision-language settings. UrbanCLIP [43] and UrbanVLP [17] utilize contrastive learning on urban images while incorporating textual prompts generated by large language models. GeoLLM [29] extracts latent geospatial knowledge from large language models through fine-tuning and prompt design. [28] investigates geographical bias in LLMs via zero-shot socioeconomic prediction, while [24] evaluates the performance of LLMs on socioeconomic tasks across region-level and city-level granularity, comparing three different paradigms. Different from these works, we introduce CityLens, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate the ability of large vision-language models to predict socioeconomic indicators using both street view and satellite imagery. CityLens spans total of 17 cities from 6 continents, 11 indicators across 6 domains."

Thus, developing diverse and challenging benchmarks to systematically assess the capabilities of LLMs has become an emerging and highly active research direction. variety of benchmarks have been proposed, including conversational benchmarks such as Chatbot Arena [10] and MT-Bench [7], coding benchmarks such as SWE-Bench [20] and LiveCodeBench [19], mathematical benchmarks such as Gaokao-MathQA [47] and SciBench [40], as well as agent benchmarks like AgentBench [26] and ToolBench [35]. Furthermore, numerous multimodal benchmarks have also been introduced to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language-Vision Models, including comprehensive benchmarks like SEED-Bench [22] and MMMU [45], and domain-specific benchmarks such as CARES [42], UrBench [48], and DABench [18]. While there are some benchmarks include urban imagery (e.g., CityBench [15] and UrBench [48]), they are not specifically designed for urban socioeconomic sensing tasks and address only very limited subset of such tasks. Therefore, in this paper, after comprehensive review of previous works in urban sensing, we propose new benchmark to fill this gap and provide opportunities to bridge LLMs with urban sensing applications."

Through extensive experiments across 3 evaluation paradigms and 17 state-of-the-art models, we find that while current models exhibit promising perceptual abilities on certain visually grounded tasks, they still face major challenges in making accurate and generalizable predictions across domains and regions. CityLens provides foundation for analyzing these limitations and motivates further research into enhancing the capabilities of large language-vision models in urban socioeconomic sensing."

            "title": "6 Discussion",
            "content": "Our benchmark results highlight both the potential and limitations of using LLVMs to predict regionlevel socioeconomic indicators. While some tasks, particularly those with visually salient correlates such as building height achieve moderate performance, most indicators remain challenging to estimate accurately. Their outputs often converge around city-level averages, suggesting that the model lacks sensitivity to intra-city variation, and consequently exhibits limited geospatial grounding. In the two LLVM as predictor paradigms, we observe that different tasks tend to favor different strategies: some perform better under direct value prediction, while others benefit from normalized estimation. Overall, our results indicate that the Feature-Based Regression paradigm, where the LLM functions as feature enhancer, significantly outperforms the two predictor-based methods. These findings suggest several promising directions for future research. First, while the feature-based method relies on trained LASSO regressor, the predictor-based methods are evaluated in zero-shot setting. This highlights the potential benefit of fine-tuning LLVMs directly for socioeconomic indicator prediction tasks. Second, improvements in prompt engineering could enhance model performance. In particular, incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting may help guide the model through intermediate reasoning steps, yielding more reliable numerical estimates. Finally, we envision the development of domain-specific agent framework tailored to urban socioeconomic sensing, which could combine visual perception, geospatial knowledge, and reasoning modules to make robust and context-aware predictions in real-world scenarios."

Table 2 lists all 28 collected indicators, along with their data sources and whether they are ultimately selected as prediction tasks. Economy Under the economy domain, we cover 7 critical indicators: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), house price, population, median household income, poverty 100%, poverty 200% and income gini coefficient. For GDP, we utilize global dataset that provides GDP estimates with spatial resolution of 1 km [39]. For population, we adopt estimates from WorldPop [37], global demographic dataset with 1 km spatial resolution that provides consistent population counts across countries. For house price, we collect data from multiple sources tailored to each countrys context: (1) For US cities, we use the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) [50], available at the ZIP code level. We map these values to census tract boundaries using spatial overlays, enabling fine-grained local prediction. (2) For UK cities, we obtain house price data from [16], targeting the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level. (3) For Chinese cities, we collect house price data from LianJia [34], one of Chinas largest online real estate platforms. For median household income, poverty 100%, and poverty 200%, we obtain the raw data from [1]. We obtain the ground-truth values for the income Gini coefficient from [46]. Transport In the transport domain, we include seven indicators: PMT, VMT, PTRP, VTRP, walk and bike ratio, public transport ratio, and drive ratio, following the design of [14]. The underlying data is sourced from [36], which provides commuting behavior statistics at the census tract level across the United States. Table 3 outlines the definitions of the seven transport related indicators. Crime In the crime domain, we focus on two indicators: violent crime incidence and non-violent crime incidence, both defined as the number of crime occurrences per census tract. The data is collected from the official websites of individual US cities [12, 30, 11], which publish annual crime reports and geolocated incident-level data. Health For the health domain, we include 9 kinds of indicators to capture different dimensions of urban health outcomes: obesity, diabetes, cancer, no leisre-time physical activity (LPA), mental health, physical health, depression rate, accessibility to healthcare, and life expectancy. The first 7 tasks focus on the United States only, using data from Local Data for Better Health [9]. The accessibility to healthcare task is defined globally, using dataset that quantifies walking-only travel time to the nearest healthcare facility [41]. The life expectancy task targets the United Kingdom, where we use data from [16] to obtain male life expectancy estimates at the MSOA level. Environment In the environment domain, we consider two indicators: carbon emissions and building height. For carbon, we use global estimates from [31]. We use global building height data obtained from [33], which provides global coverage at spatial resolution of 100 meters. Education Following [27], we use the bachelor ratio, defined as the proportion of residents holding bachelors degree or higher, as the target variable in the education domain. The ground-truth data for this indicator is obtained from SafeGraph [1], which provides fine-grained demographic datasets across the United States. A.2 Prompt Design and Case Analysis We provide additional insights into the design and behavior of LLVMs under the three evaluation methodologies. Table 4 summarizes the representative prompts used in the three paradigms, highlighting their structural differences and role-setting strategies. Figure 6 shows case in the Direct Metric Prediction setting, where the model refuses to estimate GDP due to insufficient information. Figure 7 shows an example under the Normalized Estimation setting, where the model is asked to predict the bachelor ratio based on regional images. Figure 8 presents an example from the Feature-Based 14 Table 2: Summary of 28 indicators in CityLens."
