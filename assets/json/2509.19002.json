            "content": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) Liu et al. (2023); Li et al. (2024a); Lin et al. (2024); OpenAI (2024a) have improved remarkable capabilities in video understanding. Lately, research attention has shifted toward evaluating the spatial and temporal reasoning abilities of MLLMs, prompting the proposal of new benchmarks Grauman et al. (2022); Chandrasegaran et al. (2024); Jia et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2025); Lin et al. (2025). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on micro-scale scenarios, such as indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving macro-scale geospatial scenarios, namely, long-distance travel activities involving multi-day footage across multiple cities, largely unexplored. We argue that long-horizon geospatial-temporal Equal contribution. Correspondence to Hao Wang (conan1024hao@akane.waseda.jp) . Preprint. Figure 1: Overview of VIR-Bench. Given an input travel video (Top), we reconstruct visiting order graph (Right) whose nodes are visited locations (prefectures, cities, and POIs) and whose edges capture both temporal transitions and geographic containment among the locations. The itinerary visualization (Left) omits the second stop at Atami Station for visual clarity. The video frames are adopted from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aJ4CZfn9c8. reasoning is essential for next-generation MLLMs, as numerous real-world applications, such as embodied AI planning, navigation, and autonomous driving, heavily rely on these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VIR-Bench, benchmark to evaluate long-range geospatialtemporal understanding via itinerary reconstruction from travel vlog videos. The core output is directed visiting order graph Yamamoto et al. (2025): nodes represent locations at three granularities (prefecture, city, and point of interest (POI)) and edges represent two relations, inclusion for spatial hierarchy and transition for temporal adjacency. By decomposing the task into two sub-tasks: (1) node prediction, identifying all locations visited; and (2) edge prediction, inferring geographic inclusion relations and temporal transition relations among visited locations, VIR-Bench enables separate evaluation of geospatial and temporal intelligence. Because the footage is mostly egocentric or selfie-style, models must construct holistic understanding from partial views, which further stresses geospatialtemporal reasoning. The dataset comprises 200 travel vlogs filmed across Japan, major inbound tourism destination, each accompanied by manually annotated and double-reviewed visiting order graph. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art open-weight and proprietary MLLMs, we observe persistent challenge in geospatial and temporal understanding. Particularly, open-weight models suffer from insufficient geographic knowledge and limited capability for long-context reasoning. Although proprietary models achieve better performance, they still struggle on POI node prediction and transition edge prediction, which remain major bottlenecks. Ablations further reveal that more visual context (frames), greater reasoning effort, and access to audio each provide consistent gains. Collectively, these findings highlight key obstacles that need to be addressed to advance geospatialtemporal applications in real-world settings. In addition, we develop prototype travel-planning agent that generates travel plans directly from videos and their corresponding visiting order graphs. Results from crowdsourcing and automatic evaluations indicate that the itinerary, represented by the POI list, is essential for producing logically sound and feasible plans, underscoring the importance of itinerary reconstruction. Meanwhile, the video provides rich, nuanced context that enhances the attractiveness of travel plan. setting 2 that uses both the itinerary and the video leverages these complementary strengths, highlighting promising approach to generating high-quality travel plans from multimedia sources. These findings validate that our benchmark not only effectively evaluates models but also pushes forward practical user-facing applications."

            "content": "With the rapid advancement of MLLMs, recent video understanding benchmarks have increasingly prioritized evaluating models spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities. For instance, Ego4D Grauman et al. (2022) facilitates the evaluation of models comprehension of past and future events by utilizing curated temporal data, while HourVideo Chandrasegaran et al. (2024) examines the performance of models in understanding extended-duration video content. VSI-Bench Yang et al. (2025) assesses models ability to infer 3D scene layouts from 2D video inputs, while OST-Bench Lin et al. (2025) evaluates spatial-temporal understanding by requiring models to explore and interpret information within 3D space. CityGuessr Kulkarni et al. (2024) introduces video-based benchmark for assessing geo-localization using driving videos, while UrbanVideo-Bench Zhao et al. (2025) targets the embodied cognitive abilities of MLLMs within urban 3D environments using drone-collected footage. Nevertheless, most existing benchmarks primarily feature indoor scenarios or short-distance outdoor movements, lacking extensive long-distance traversal, such as inter-city journeys. Consequently, these benchmarks are insufficient for thoroughly evaluating the geospatial-temporal intelligence of MLLMs. In contrast, VIR-Bench specifically addresses this gap by comprehensively assessing video understanding capabilities across extended spatial (e.g., from Tokyo to Osaka, Hokkaido to Kyoto) and temporal (spanning multiple days) scales. 2."

(2017); Haris and Gan (2021); Yamamoto et al. (2025). representative study by Yamamoto et al. (2025) introduces visiting order graph designed to capture relationships among visited locations and provides benchmark dataset for training and evaluating itinerary extraction models. In multimodal settings, Pang et al. (2011) proposes framework aimed at summarizing travelogues by integrating text and images from blogs. More recently, Rosa (2024) leverages MLLMs to perform structured entity extraction from travel videos, while Zhuang et al. (2024) tackles the inverse problem by generating vlogs with diverse travel scenes. This study advances this line of work by providing, to our knowledge, the first systematic investigation into extracting and reconstructing itineraries directly from videos, establishing new benchmark for video-centric geospatial and temporal understanding. 2."

            "content": "The complexity of manual trip planning has driven research into automated itinerary generation. Initial approaches were often based on optimization problems like the Tourist Trip Design Problem and classic machine learning Gavalas et al. (2014); Chen et al. (2016); He et al. (2019); Carrillo et al. (2023). More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled more sophisticated and flexible frameworks Chen et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2024). Current research trends include developing novel reasoning paradigms Gui et al. (2025), creating hybrid systems that combine LLMs with classical planners de la Rosa et al. (2024), and enhancing personalization through user model integration and interactive feedback Singh et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2024); Otaki and Baba (2025). To rigorously evaluate these methods, various benchmarks have been developed. Notable studies include real-world planning Xie et al. (2024), fine-grained spatio-temporal planning Chaudhuri et al. (2025), and assessing personalization Singh et al. (2024). Existing benchmarks and generation methods primarily use text data such as user preferences and travel logs as input. In contrast, this research uses travel videos as input, aiming to reconstruct the itinerary based on their content. 3 Figure 2: Example of visiting order graph.

(2025). simplified example is shown in Figure 2. visiting order graph is hierarchical directed graph with four node types: Root node: the starting node of the graph. Prefecture node: the highest-level administrative division (e.g., Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi). City node: municipality within prefecture, including Tokyos special wards, cities, towns, and villages. POI node: specific named location (point of interest), such as landmarks, tourist attractions, stations, restaurants, cafes, stores, parks, or museums. The graph includes two edge types: Inclusion edge: directed edge representing containment of one location within another. This edge flows from the larger geographical area to the smaller one. Prefecture City (e.g., Aichi Nagoya). City POI (e.g., Nagoya Nagoya Station). POI sub-POI (e.g., Nagoya Station Ippudo - Nagoya Station Branch). Transition edge: directed edge representing movement between two distinct locations at the same hierarchical level; it indicates the chronological flow of travel. Between prefectures (e.g., Tokyo Aichi). Between cities within the same prefecture (e.g., Taito City Chiyoda City). Between POIs within the same city (e.g., Nagoya Station MIRAI TOWER). To prevent cycles in the graph, we treat multiple visits to the same location as distinct nodes. Following Yamamoto et al. (2025), we also introduce special Overlap edge to handle POIs that are geographically overlapping but cannot be represented through inclusion edges."

            "content": "Identifying locations visited in travel videos is similar to playing GeoGuessr2: annotators infer places from visual cues. We recruited 10 Japan-based annotators, each tasked with collecting 20 YouTube travel videos filmed in Japan. The videos could be narrated in English or Japanese. Annotators were asked to identify all visited POIs in each video. We define visit as when the POI appears in the video and it is clear that the videographer visited the facility. For every POI, they recorded the start and end times within the video and provided the corresponding Google Maps URL. When location could not be uniquely identified (e.g., cafe shown without its name), they entered the placeholder UNKNOWN and recorded the POI category (e.g., cat_cafe). After annotation, we retrieved detailed information of each POI including name, address and categories using Google Places API. Using the timestamped POIs, we then constructed visiting order graph for each video (e.g., Figure 2). We also conducted quality check of the generated graphs and corrected errors by rerunning the retrieval step manually when POIs were incorrectly annotated or matched. This pipeline yielded VIR-Bench, dataset of 200 travel videos paired with their corresponding visiting order graphs. In total, 3,689 POIs were identified across 43 of Japans 47 prefectures. Detailed annotation guidelines and dataset statistics are provided in Appendix A."

To address this, we decompose the task into two sub-tasks: node prediction and edge prediction. We describe each of these tasks in the following. Node Prediction This task evaluates models geospatial understanding, akin to playing GeoGuessr. Given video, MLLMs are asked to return all visited locations in three JSON lists (prefectures, cities, and POIs). For each POI, the model must also predict its category. Edge Prediction Given video and all visited locations (gold labels, shuffled), MLLMs are asked to predict all inclusion and transition edges that constitute the videos visiting order graph. The output should be JSON list of tuples formatted as <source, target, edge_type>. Inclusion edge prediction evaluates models geospatial knowledge, while transition edge prediction assesses their temporal understanding. We omit overlap edges in this task due to their low frequency."

The overall scores are computed as weighted averages across different node and edge types, with weights proportional to the number of elements in each task category. We also provide detailed error analysis in Appendix B.2. Overall Performance Across all five task categories, open-weight models continue to underperform proprietary models. The strongest open model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, comes close to proprietary performance on the easier categories (prefecture node prediction and inclusion edge prediction), but substantial gaps remain on the harder categories (POI node prediction and transition edge prediction). Other open models perform markedly worse: the LLaVA-Video series and InternVL3-8B achieve only single-digit F1 in city and POI node prediction, and five of the nine models also remain in single digits on transition edge prediction. In the proprietary models, Gemini-2.5-Pro is the top performer, especially on edge prediction, yet its F1 scores for city/POI node and transition edge prediction remain around 60. Taken together, these findings indicate that VIR-Bench is highly challenging for current MLLMs and highlight persistent limitations in geospatial and temporal understanding.

All reported scores are F1 values. for the LLaVA-Video and InternVL3 series); however, models with larger budgets (180 for VideoLLaMA3 and 256 for Qwen2.5-VL) still struggle, suggesting the issue is not solely input length. Inspecting outputs from lower-performing models reveals two recurrent failure modes: (i) The model sometimes misinterprets the task, including the definitions of inclusion and transition edges; although it produces valid JSON, it yields nonsensical tuples such as <Tokyo, Shibuya, transition>. (ii) Transition edges are constrained to connect locations at the same hierarchical level; for POIs, edges are permitted only between POIs within the same city. Models often ignore this constraint and predict cross-city transitions, for example linking POI in Tokyo to one in Osaka. These factors render the task an even more challenging test of temporal reasoning. Impact of Model Size When comparing models of different sizes within the same families (LLaVAVideo, InternVL3, Qwen2.5-VL), we observe steady, scale-driven gains on node prediction, whereas edge prediction shows sharp jump; for example, transition F1 improves by about 16 from Qwen2.5VL-7B to Qwen2.5-VL-72B. This pattern reflects the task demands: node prediction is localized, single-point task that primarily relies on geospatial knowledge encoded in the models, whereas edge prediction requires holistic view of the itinerary and thus benefits more from larger models with stronger long-context and temporal reasoning. An exception is LLaVA-Video-72B, which shows minimal improvement over LLaVA-Video-7B in POI node prediction. This is likely due to the limited geographic coverage in the LLaVA-OneVision training data Li et al. (2024b). In contrast, models like Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate strong geo-localization capabilities; in our internal evaluations, Qwen2.5-VL was able to accurately predict POI coordinates, indicating extensive pretraining on geographic data. Thinking Models Performance Among the evaluated models, o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro are the only ones that perform explicit thinking at inference. Although neither has an available nonthinking counterpart, we use GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash as proximate baselines to gauge what thinking contributes on VIR-Bench. On node prediction, the gains from thinking are limited: for POI nodes, o4-mini achieves higher precision but lower recall, while Gemini-2.5-Pro shows the opposite trend, suggesting different thinking strategies between OpenAI and Google. In contrast, for edge prediction, enabling deliberate thinking yields large gains for both models, especially Gemini-2.5-Pro, indicating that temporal understanding demands more complex reasoning. We presume that Geminis advantage stems from its use of audio, which supplies continuous, fine-grained temporal cues that sparsely sampled frames cannot provide, highlighting the need for truly multimodal modeling. To further validate the impact of reasoning and audio usage, we conduct additional ablation studies in the following section."

Increasing the number of input frames consistently improves GPT-4.1s overall performance. In particular, the model limited to 64 frames performs poorly on POI node and transition edge prediction, suggesting that for videos in our benchmark, at least 128 frames (1 frame every 14s) are minimum requirement for reliable temporal reasoning. Higher reasoning effort (i.e., longer thinking) leads o4-mini to better performance, especially on transition 7 edge prediction, confirming our earlier observation that the task requires high-level, long-context reasoning. Removing audio from Gemini-2.5-Flash yields worse results across most categories, with nearly 50% drop on transition edge prediction. This confirms that audio is essential for temporal understanding, as it offers finer and more continuous granularity than the video stream (sampled at 1 fps), likely supporting more consistent long-context reasoning."

Output The output is travel plan formatted in Markdown. It includes basic information such as the destination, duration, and budget. core component is detailed day-by-day itinerary, specifying schedule of activities, visiting times for each POI, and transportation methods. This itinerary is supplemented with POI details and other rich information extracted from the provided video and/or the search results.

This central component is responsible for dynamically determining the execution order of agents, managing the shared state of them. The framework comprises five specialized agents, each tasked with specific function: Plan Agent constructs the day-by-day schedule, optimizing time allocation based on the users budget and constraints. Google Maps Agent retrieves POI details. Route Agent finds the routes between POIs given the list of POIs. Accommodation Agent finds suitable lodging that fits the budget and is optimally located relative to the planned activities. Summary Agent integrates the outputs from all other agents to generate unified final report, including complete travel plan and budget breakdown. Each agent can use tools that are appropriate for its purpose, including Google Maps API-based tools and browser-based tools. Further implementation details are shown in Appendix C.1."

The evaluation consists of four tasks: assessing the plans attractiveness (Attraction), verifying the feasibility of the transportation information (Feasibility), judging the suitability of the number of POIs (Density), and determining the plans consistency with the video (Alignment). We also evaluate the systems POIs selection. Using GPT-4o OpenAI (2024b), we extract the POIs mentioned in the generated plans and treat them as selected.

In the Total row, selected refers to POIs chosen in at least one setting, and unselected refers to POIs never chosen in any setting. completely unrelated (31%). This instability suggests that the agents success is highly dependent on the initial, error-prone step of identifying POIs from raw video. failure in this stage, as evidenced by the low node prediction F1-scores  (Table 1)  , leads directly to final plan that is misaligned with the videos content. This underscores that robust itinerary reconstruction is foundational prerequisite for generating contextually relevant and reliable travel plans. In terms of practicality, all settings generated feasible plans. The POI-only setting was most reliable in providing transportation information, while the video-based settings were slightly better at creating plan with just right density of activities (Figure 4c). The video-only setting had the highest proportion of plans lacking transportation information (22%, Figure 4b) among the three settings. Analysis of POI Selection Table 5 provides deeper insights into the agents underlying POI selection strategy. For all input settings, the agent showed strong and statistically significant tendency to select POIs that were featured for longer duration in the video. This effect was most pronounced in the P+V setting ( = +41.7, < 0.001), suggesting that the combination of POI list and video context enables the agent to most effectively identify and prioritize key locations. Furthermore, the agent also showed preference for POIs with higher Google Maps ratings, although this effect was less pronounced than that of video duration. These findings indicate that the agent intelligently synthesizes signals from both the video (visual prominence) and external knowledge sources (user ratings) to make its planning decisions."

            "content": "We presented VIR-Bench, video understanding benchmark designed to evaluate long-range geospatialtemporal reasoning through itinerary reconstruction, utilizing visiting order graphs constructed from 200 travel videos. By decomposing the task into node and edge prediction, we revealed persistent weaknesses in state-of-the-art MLLMs: open-weight models consistently lag behind proprietary ones, and transition edges remain the primary bottleneck. Our prototype travel-planning agent further illustrated the practical value of VIR-Bench, demonstrating that combining POI lists with videos generates the most appealing travel plans, particularly emphasizing visually salient and highly rated POIs. In summary, VIR-Bench provides both rigorous benchmark and practical foundation for advancing MLLMs toward video-grounded geospatialtemporal understanding in real-world travel planning scenarios. Looking ahead, we intend to expand our dataset by increasing geographic and 10 linguistic diversity, incorporating broader range of filming styles, and enhancing annotation richness. Furthermore, we aim to explore advanced agent systems capable of referencing multiple videos simultaneously, enabling the generation of more comprehensive and engaging travel plans."

            "content": "This project constructs video understanding benchmark to evaluate multimodal LLMs temporal and spatial grounding capabilities. Concretely, the task is to input travel vlog into the MLLM and have it infer the subjects movement trajectory (e.g., Haneda Airport Shinjuku Station McDonalds Seibu-Shinjuku Ekimae). To enable trajectory analysis and evaluation, this annotation collects the set of POIs visited in each video. The overall workflow consists of two stages: (1) selecting videos, and (2) annotating trajectories. A.1.2 Video Selection Please search YouTube for videos that satisfy all of the following required criteria: 1. The video is travel vlog set within Japan. Videos that include leaving Japan (e.g., trip to Korea) are not allowed. 2. The spoken language in the video is the language specified by the authors (Japanese or English). 3. Apart from the intro/outro, the video progresses in chronological order. Narratives that jump back to earlier scenes are not allowed. 4. The subjects do not split into multiple groups acting in parallel (no scenes where different places are visited simultaneously). 5. It is tourism-oriented, visiting multiple POIs, rather than simple neighborhood stroll. 6. The video does not continuously overlay POI names as on-screen captions (short captions for few seconds are acceptable). 7. The preferred duration is 1020 minutes, and at most 30 minutes. In addition to the required criteria, please aim to satisfy the following desirable criteria where possible: 1. Geographic diversity across the set of videos assigned to single annotator (e.g., avoid selecting ten videos all in Tokyo). 2. Prefer videos that span multiple prefectures. Example videos (for reference): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-t3IFu-U7U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjWr1NYVGPc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuEOnd5cAA8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqbiBTgcaiA A.1.3 Trajectory Annotation Definition of POI In this project, POI is defined as place registered on Google Maps. Exclude locations with extremely few reviews (0 or near 0), and places unrelated to tourism (e.g., station-front public restroom). Annotation Tool We use Vidat Zhang et al. (2020), browser-based video annotation tool. Before starting, we strongly recommend watching the official 7-minute tutorial video. Procedure Annotate the video trajectory as follows: 1. Access Vidat in your browser: https://vidat2.davidz.cn/#/ 2. Load the downloaded video. 3. For each POI visit, use the timeline to select the start and end time and create new segment. 14 4. Copy the corresponding Google Maps URL for that POI into the segments description. Example: https://maps.app.goo.gl/DT4ENgf8dUopWNUK6. 5. Move on to the next POI and repeat steps 34. 6. When finished, save the annotation as <videoID>.json. A.1.4 FAQ 1. POIs with the Same Name Q: There are multiple entries named Sakuragicho Station. Which one? A: Choose the entry with the larger number of reviews. 2. Hierarchical Structure of POIs Q: What if POI contains another POI? (e.g., Ghibli Park is within Expo 2005 Aichi Commemorative Park.) A: Annotate all levels of the hierarchy. The parent POIs start/end times must enclose the child POIs times. If the parent times are (x1, y1) and the child times are (x2, y2), ensure x1 < x2 < y2 < y1 ."

POIs Missing from Google Maps Q: rural shop may not exist as POI on Google Maps. A: Leave the URL blank and write <shop name> + <category>, analogous to the UNKNOWN handling. 7. Closed or Relocated Venues Q: The venue visited in the video has since closed or moved. A: If it is closed but still exists as POI entry on Google Maps, annotate as usual. For relocations, annotate according to the current location as listed on Google Maps. 8. Intros/Outros Q: The intro (or outro) shows all POIs. Annotate them?

A: The start time is when the subject physically arrives at the POI; the end time is when they leave. Q: How precise must we be at hard cuts between scenes? A: Do not annotate with frame-level strictness; reasonable precision is sufficient. 10. Definition of Visit Q: Do they need to enter the facility to count as visit? A: If they reach the front of the facility and it is visibly captured in the frame, count it as visit. Distant landmarks merely visible on the horizon do not count. A.2 Statistics VIR-Bench comprises 200 travel videos filmed across Japan, each paired with corresponding visiting order graph that captures the itinerary depicted in the video. Of these, 100 videos are narrated in English, while the rest are in Japanese. Detailed statistics are shown in Table 6. Figure 5 presents key dataset statistics, while Figure 6 visualizes the geographical distribution of POIs across Japan.

Prompt analysis errors can arise in both node and edge prediction tasks, while geographic knowledge errors are primarily observed in node prediction, and temporal reasoning errors occur exclusively in edge prediction. B.2.1 Prompt Analysis Error Node Prediction Figure 7 is an output example from LLaVA-Video-7B for the video at https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guZrrVMGfI. The model simply copied the example output provided in the input prompt  (Table 9)  , without attempting to predict the actual visited locations in the video. We believe this behavior is due to the relatively long prompt, which may have hindered the models ability to follow instructions effectively. Figure 7: Example of prompt analysis error made by the model during the node prediction task. 18 Figure 8 shows another example from LLaVA-Video-7B using the video at https://www.youtube. com/watch?v=nzUKUdEHWAc. The video is vlog filmed in Nikko, Tochigi, but the model listed numerous prefectures, cities, and POIs, resembling random guessing. Figure 8: Another example of prompt analysis error made by the model during the node prediction task. Edge Prediction Figure 9 presents an example from InternVL3-8B using the video at https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YWj6ll-tJI. The model appeared to misinterpret the concept of sub-POI, failing to capture the inclusion edge between Owakudani and Owakudani Stationa relation that should be identifiable even without geographic knowledge. Additionally, its grasp of transition edges was insufficient: it generated five outgoing transition edges from Owakudani Station, completely disregarding the videos chronological order. Figure 9: Example of prompt analysis error made by the model during the edge prediction task. 19 B.2.2 Geographic Knowledge Error Figure 10 shows an example from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the video at https://www.youtube. com/watch?v=x37h_iPtWiI. Although the model correctly identified the prefecture as Okinawa, it failed to predict the correct cities, returning only Naha, the most well-known city in Okinawa but not visited in the video. Its POI predictions were also poor, with fewer than half of the locations correctly identified. These results suggest that the model has limited understanding of geographic knowledge. Figure 10: Example of geographic knowledge error. Figure 11 presents another example from Gemini-2.5-Flash using the video at https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=RCpg1DHX-7s. While the predicted POIs are largely accurate, some cities featured in the videosuch as Chiyoda City and Shinjuku Citywere omitted. Interestingly, the model correctly identified Nabazo Shinjuku Sanchome Store but failed to associate it with Shinjuku City, suggesting that even strong proprietary models still exhibit limitations in geographic reasoning. B.2.3 Temporal Reasoning Error Figure 12 presents an example from InternVL3-78B using the video at https://www.youtube. com/watch?v=kBErL9FMce4. The video features multiple visited locations (e.g., HOTEL ORIGO HAKATA and LAMP LIGHT BOOKS HOTEL), but most of these visits are ignored by the model. If predicted correctly, the model-predicted graph in Figure 12 would contain many circles, as we visualize each visited location as single node. This suggests that the model failed to form holistic view of the itinerary, instead constructing the graph in piecemeal manneradding edges one by one without considering the overall structure. Figure 13 presents another example from o4-mini using the video at https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=0Vjufc6rhH8. When the video contains large number of POIs, the overall flow of the model-predicted graph becomes difficult to follow, indicating that even strong reasoning models like o4-mini still struggle with limited long-context and temporal reasoning capabilities. While we attempted to obtain the thinking summary provided by OpenAI, the information was too sparse to yield meaningful insights (thinking summary for the generation process of Figure 13 is shown in Table 8). We contend that the development of open-weight reasoning MLLMs is urgently needed, and VIR-Bench offers challenging benchmark for evaluating their capabilities. Figure 11: Another example of geographic knowledge error. **Planning visit to Numazu** want to explore Nakamise Shopping Street in Numazu. Ill stroll through the street and check out Marusan bookstore. Then, Ill look for the Yasushi Inoues Mother and Child statue nearby. Next, Ill consider which landmark to visit maybe Onari Bridge? After that, Ill visit Agetsuchi Asahi Inari Shrine, enjoying the river view. Finally, Ill head back to the station, catch the bus to Izu Mito Sea Paradise, and pass the rental car location! Table 8: Thinking summary of o4-mini during the generation process for Figure 13. 21 Figure 12: Example of temporal reasoning error. Due to the output format, multiple visited locations in the model-predicted graph appear as single node, unlike the multiple nodes in the ground-truth graph. Figure 13: Another example of temporal reasoning error. 22 B.3 Prompt Templates The prompts used for node and edge prediction are shown in Table 9 and Table 10, respectively. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ### **Overview** **Role**: You are an expert geo-location AI with specialization in Japanese geography and travel analysis. **Objective**: Analyze the provided video of trip in Japan and identify all visited locations. **Input**: video file depicting travel within Japan. ### **Location Definitions** 1. **Prefecture (都道府県)**: The highest-level administrative division of Japan, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima,Hokkaido, etc. 2. **City (東京23区市町村)**: The municipality within prefecture. This include Tokyos 23 Specific Wards like Shibuya and Minato, cities like Yokohama and Sapporo, towns like Karuizawa and Hakone, and villages like Hakuba and Shirakawa. 3. **Point of Interest (POI)**: specific, named location. This includes landmarks, tourist attractions, stations, restaurants, cafes, stores, parks, museums, etc. ### **Instructions & Rules** 1. **No Duplicates**: Each unique prefecture, city, and POI should appear only once in its respective list. 2. **Maximum Specificity**: Always use the most specific and complete name identifiable. For businesses, include the branch name if visible (e.g., \"Starbucks Shibuya Tsutaya\" not just \"Starbucks\"). 3. **Verification over Guesswork**: Only include locations that can be confidently identified from clear visual or auditory cues in the video (e.g., signs, logos, building architecture, announcements). Do not guess or infer locations that are not explicitly evidenced. 4. **Minimum POI Unit**: Do not list integrated facilities within POI (e.g., museums gift shop). However, you must list separate businesses located inside larger commercial complex, such as specific café within shopping mall or train station. 5. **Maximum POI Unit**: Do not include general geographic areas, districts, or neighborhoods which are not single, managed entities (e.g., \"Minato Mirai,\" \"Kokusai Dori\"). 6. **POI Formatting**: Strictly adhere to the \"Name (category)\" format for all entries in the points_of_interest list. You must select the single most appropriate category for each POI from the curated list below. **POI Category List**: [adventure_sports_center, airport, american_restaurant, amusement_center, amusement_park, aquarium, arena, art_gallery, ... ### **Output Format** Generate single JSON object conforming to the schema below. Ensure the lists are populated according to the rules above. **JSON Schema**: json { \"prefectures\": [\"list of prefectures\"], \"cities\": [\"list of cities\"], \"points_of_interest\": [\"list of points of interest\"] } **Example Output**: For video showing person arriving at Kansai International Airport, taking train to Osaka, seeing the Glico Running Man sign, and then eating at Dotonbori restaurant, the output should be: json { \"prefectures\": [ \"Osaka\" ], \"cities\": [ \"Izumisano\", \"Osaka\" ], \"points_of_interest\": [ \"Kansai International Airport (airport)\", \"Namba Station (train_station)\", \"Glico Running Man Sign (tourist_attraction)\", \"Kukuru Dotonbori (japanese_restaurant)\" ] } --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 9: Prompt for node prediction. 23 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ### **Overview** **Role**: You are an expert geo-location AI with specialization in Japanese geography and travel analysis. **Objective**: Analyze the provided video of trip in Japan. Based on the sequence of visited locations, generate directed graph representing the visiting trajectory. The graph should distinguish between hierarchical containment (e.g., landmark within city) and sequential travel (e.g., moving from one landmark to another). **Input**: video file depicting travel within Japan and all visited locations. ### **Input** The input for visited locations is JSON object, as shown below. Crucially, the lists are **not** in chronological order. json {{ input_json }} ### **Edge Definitions** 1. **Inclusion Edge**: directed edge representing containment of one location within another. This edge flows from the larger geographical area to the smaller one. - Example: - From prefecture to city: Osaka (prefecture) Osaka (city) - From city to point of interest (POI): Shibuya Shibuya Station - From POI to sub-POI: AEON MALL Zama AEON Cinema Zama 2. **Transition Edge**: directed edge representing movement between two distinct locations at the same hierarchical level. This edge indicates the chronological flow of travel. - Example: - Between prefectures: Osaka Hiroshima - Between cities (within the same prefecture): Shibuya Shinjuku - Between POIs (within the same city): Tokyo Tower Odaiba Marine Park ### **Instructions & Rules** 1. **Inclusion Edges**: - For every city in the input, create an inclusion edge from its corresponding prefecture node. - For every POI in the input, create an inclusion edge from its corresponding city node. - For every sub-POI (if applicable) within POI, create an inclusion edge from the POI node to the sub-POI node. 2. **Transition Edges**: - Create transition edges between consecutively visited locations at the same hierarchical level. - transition from POI in City to POI in City breaks the POI-level transition chain. The graph must instead show transition edge from City to City B. - Similarly, transition from city in Prefecture to city in Prefecture is represented by transition edge from Prefecture to Prefecture B. 3. **Location Useage**: - Please make sure to use only the exact location names provided in the inputdo not alter, add to, or infer any names beyond what is given. 4. **Unkonwn POIs**: - For POIs which can not be identified with certainty, we provide placeholders in the format \"Unknown (category)\" (e.g., Unknown (restaurant)). Use these placeholders when creating edges. ### **Output Format** Generate single JSON object conforming to the schema below. This object will represent the final directed graph with all nodes and edges correctly populated according to the rules. **JSON Schema**: json { \"edges\": [ { \"source\": \"string\", \"target\": \"string\", \"type\": \"inclusion transition\" } ] } **Example Output**: For video showing person arriving at Kansai International Airport, taking train to Osaka, seeing the Glico Running Man sign, and then eating at Dotonbori restaurant, the output should be: json { \"edges\": [ { \"source\": \"Osaka\", \"target\": \"Izumisano\", \"type\": \"inclusion\" }, ... { \"source\": \"Glico Running Man Sign\", \"target\": \"Kukuru Dotonbori\", \"type\": \"transition\" } ] } ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 10: Prompt for edge prediction."

The sequence diagram of this system is shown in Figure 14. As tools, following external services are used: Google Places API: For detailed POI information and accommodation information. Google Routes API: For route search (TRANSIT mode is unavailable in Japan). BrowserUse5: For fallback of the route search by automated GUI-based browser operation. We randomly set the input constraints as below: Headcount: 1 to 4 Duration: 2 days to 4 days. Budget per day per person: 70 USD to 500 USD. C.2 Evaluation Details We have evaluated generated plans using crowdsourcing on Yahoo! Crowdsourcing6. The instructions to crowdworkers and the screen where the workers execute the tasks are shown in Table 12, 13, 14, 15 and Figure 15, respectively. The shown instructions are translated into English while they are originally in Japanese. To ensure the quality of the evaluation, we included check questions with obvious correct answers and only accepted responses from users who answered them correctly. One check question was assigned to each worker. In the alignment task, we asked the workers to watch videos and then answer the questions, as shown in Figure 4d.

It is original, and you feel strongly that you want to travel according to this plan. Rating 4: Attractive Criteria: well-made, good plan. The destinations are attractive, and the itinerary flows smoothly. The information is specific and sufficient, and many people will be satisfied with the content. Rating 3: Average Criteria: Gives the impression of list of typical tourist destinations. Not bad, but nothing special. The information is mostly abstract, such as visit XX, and the content is commonplace. Rating 2: Somewhat unattractive Criteria: Not very appealing plan. There are questions about the choice of places to visit, and the information is not specific enough. It is difficult to imagine how enjoyable the trip will be. Rating 1: Not attractive at all Criteria: It is difficult to understand why this plan was chosen. The combination of places to visit is incongruous, and there is very little information, making it completely unattractive. Points to note when evaluating Attractiveness of destinations: Are the selected locations attractive as travel themes or destinations? Are there any suggestions other than the usual tourist spots, such as hidden gems? Specificity of information: The appeal can vary greatly depending on whether it simply says lunch or fresh seafood bowl lunch at XX market.

Specific example: The video is about trip to Kyoto, but the itinerary is for trip to Okinawa. None of the tourist spots featured in the video are included in the itinerary. 2. The itinerary is partially related to the video but mostly unrelated Criteria: The itinerary includes one or two locations featured in the video, but overall it is completely different itinerary.

The itinerary is basically the same as the video, but includes some parts that are not related to the video Criteria: Most of the itinerary follows the content of the video, but there are additional places that are not shown in the video, or parts of the video are missing. Specific example: The order of visits in the video (ABC) is reproduced, but place called that is not in the video has been added to the itinerary. The itinerary covers all the major tourist spots visited in the video, but café that was visited is missing. 4. Itinerary that follows the video Criteria: The itinerary faithfully reproduces the content of the video, including the places visited, the order of visits, and the meals. Specific example: The sequence introduced in the video (Breakfast at Café Sightseeing at Temple Street food at Shopping Street) is listed exactly as it appears in the itinerary. Points to note when evaluating Order of visits: It is important that the places visited are correct. Minor differences in order are not major issue. Check that the specific names of shops and dishes mentioned in the video are reflected in the itinerary. There is no need to recreate every action in the video (e.g., stopping at convenience store, getting slightly lost). As long as the main events are covered, it is acceptable.
