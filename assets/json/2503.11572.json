            "content": "Implicit bias refers to automatic or spontaneous mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors based on social categories such as race, gender, or age [Greenwald and Lai, 2020, Payne and Gawronski, 2010]. Implicit biases often operate rapidly and with high efficiency, requiring minimal cognitive resources while influencing judgments through the automatic activation of stored information about social groups [Melnikoff and Bargh, 2018, Bargh and Williams, 2006, Fazio et al., 1986]. This efficiency in processing allows implicit biases to operate even under conditions of limited attention or cognitive load. As result, implicit bias can influence behavior regardless of consciously held values and beliefs. Research demonstrates that implicit bias significantly relates to real-world outcomes, with researchers describing potential role of implicit bias in domains such as employment [Agerström and Rooth, 2011], healthcare [FitzGerald and Hurst, 2017], and criminal justice [Spencer et al., 2016]. 1.1 Implicit Association Test (IAT) To measure these automatic evaluations in humans, researchers developed the Implicit Association Test [IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998]. During the test, participants are instructed to rapidly pair group category stimuli with attributes. For example, in the Race IAT, participants are asked to press one key for White faces and pleasant words and another for Black faces and unpleasant words (i.e., association-compatible pairings). After many trials of pairing stimuli to those categories, the pairings are switched. In the next set of trials, Black faces and pleasant words share key, while White faces and unpleasant words share the other key (i.e., association-incompatible pairings). The difference in response times between these sets of trials informs understanding about how concepts are linked together in memory. Typically, people show faster responses for association-compatible pairings than incompatible pairings, indicating the presence of automatically activated associations between social groups and stereotypical attributes. The IAT has become the most popular tool for examining implicit bias [Greenwald et al., 2009] as it effectively captures the automatic evaluation processes that underlie implicit bias.

            "title": "Implicit Bias in Language Models",
            "content": "With the recent advancement of language models, researchers have explored whether language models exhibit biases like humans do. Past work has focused on finding evidence of bias in how language models reproduce societal stereotypes in their generated content [Abid et al., 2021, Lucy and Bamman, 2021]. In light of these findings, more recent models undergo extensive post-training steps such as instruction fine tuning and supervised learning to ensure that the model aligns with human values [Ziegler et al., 2020, Ouyang et al., 2022]. As result, the more recent models are less likely to express bias in generated content. However, there remain concerns about implicit bias in language models. Zhao et al. [2024] had GPT-3.5 complete templates by filling in social group pairs (e.g., \"X are nurses as are surgeons\") then evaluate these completions as \"right\" or \"wrong.\" Models tended to generate stereotypical completions (e.g., \"Women are nurses as Men are surgeons\") while simultaneously labeling them as \"wrong.\" Bai et al. [2025] administered modified version of the Implicit Association Test, asking LLMs to pick words signaling social group identities (e.g., Julia and Ben) next to list of attribute words (e.g., home, work). Then, they calculated the proportion of association-compatible pairings. The authors found that proprietary LLMs, despite being trained to align with human values and avoid expressing biases, still showed stronger tendency to create association-compatible rather than incompatible pairings. With advanced post-training techniques making biases harder to detect in model outputs, attention has shifted to more subtle forms of biases in how LLMs operate. These patterns, while not detectable in conventional evaluations, may systematically influence model behavior in consequential ways. Bai et al. [2025] demonstrated this by showing correlation between LLMs responses in modified Implicit Association Test and models tendency to exhibit bias in decision-making contexts. Given the growing deployment of language models in decision-making contexts, understanding and addressing these hard-to-detect patterns is crucial for preventing discriminatory outcomes, particularly as models become more proficient at avoiding blatant forms of bias."

            "title": "1.3 Reasoning Models and Reasoning Tokens",
            "content": "Reasoning models represent significant breakthrough in language model capabilities. Through reinforcement learning, reasoning models have been trained to generate intermediate reasoning steps, producing sequence of \"reasoning tokens\" that represent their thought process. These reasoning tokens are step-by-step articulations of the models problem-solving approach before it arrives at final answer. For example, when asked \"What is 23 48?\", reasoning model might generate tokens like: \"Let me break this down: (20 + 3) 48 = 20 48 + 3 48 = 960 + 144 = 1104.\" This reasoning approach has shown to dramatically improve model performance on complex tasks such as coding, commonsense and arithmetic reasoning [Wei et al., 2023]. Some examples of reasoning models include OpenAIs o1, o3-mini [OpenAI, 2025], and DeepSeeks R1 [DeepSeek-AI, 2025]. Reasoning tokens provide unique window for researchers to understand how models process information, paralleling how response latencies are used to quantify automatic evaluations in IATs. Similar to how increased response times in humans indicate greater cognitive effort and deliberation when processing association-incompatible information, higher reasoning token count suggests increased computational processing when the model encounters associations that contradict previously observed patterns. This metric enables assessment of automatic evaluations, offering closer parallel to the IAT."

            "title": "1.4 This Work",
            "content": "Previous research purporting to measure implicit bias patterns in language models has primarily examined model outputs and word associations [Bai et al., 2025, Zhao et al., 2024]. However, these approaches capture the outcome of how model processes information rather than the actual processing of information itself. Such associations could simply reflect biases present in training data rather than computational patterns analogous to human implicit cognition. In this work, we propose novel approach that examines the degree of automaticity or deliberation in reasoning models by measuring how much models expend computational effort through reasoning token usage. This framework parallels how human implicit bias is studied through response latencies in the IAT. In the IAT, processing efficiency decreases when handling association-incompatible information, requiring greater cognitive effort that result in delays in response time. By analyzing computational processing patterns (i.e., how model \"thinks\") rather than outputs (i.e, what model \"does\"), we more closely capture phenomena analogous to implicit bias in language models. 2 PREPRINT - MARCH 17, 2025 Figure 1: In the Reasoning Model IAT (RM-IAT), the reasoning model is first presented with word stimuli representing the group and attribute categories, then the condition-specific instructions (i.e., association-compatible or incompatible), and then the writing task prompt.

            "content": "The traditional IAT consists of seven blocks [Greenwald et al., 2009, 2003]. The first two blocks familiarize participants with the stimuli; participants classify labels or images used to represent two group categories (e.g., names of men and women) and two attribute categories (e.g., career and family). In the first set of combined blocks (Blocks 3-4), participants respond to association-compatible pairings by pressing the same key for instruments/pleasant and weapons/unpleasant. After practice block where only the two categories are presented and switched (Block 5), the second set of combined blocks (Blocks 6-7) presents association-incompatible pairings (e.g., same key for instruments/unpleasant and weapons/pleasant). Blocks 3-4 and 6-7 are usually counterbalanced to control for possible order effects. In adapting the IAT for reasoning models, we modified the design to accommodate the non-sequential nature of API interactions. In the traditional IAT, participants progress through sequential blocks where information carries forward from one block to the next (e.g., first learning the group and attribute categories then performing classifications). However, reasoning models process each prompt independently, with no memory of previous interactions. Therefore, we included all relevant group and attribute category information in each prompt. For example, in the Men/Women + Career/Family RM-IAT, rather than having separate blocks to familiarize the stimuli, we provided them at the beginning of each prompt: 1https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#how-reasoning-works 2The default value of the reasoning_effort parameterwhich determines the number of tokens the model should use before creating responseis \"medium.\" Other options for this parameter are only accessible to certain users and were not available. 3 PREPRINT - MARCH 17, The words John, Paul, Mike, Kevin, Steve, Greg, Jeff, and Bill are used to represent men. The words Amy, Joan, Lisa, Sarah, Diana, Kate, Ann, Donna are used to represent women. The words executive, management, professional, corporation, salary, office, business, career are used to represent the career category. The words home, parents, children, family, cousins, marriage, wedding, relatives are used to represent the family category. In each API call, the model was instructed to assign group category word (e.g., \"Steve\" for the category \"men\") to attribute categories (e.g., career/family). We created two experimental conditions with different mapping instructions. In the association-compatible condition, the model was asked to categorize group category words to their stereotypically associated attribute categories (e.g., men with career and women with family). In the association-incompatible condition, the mapping was reversed (e.g., men with family and women with career). Here are the instructions used for each condition: For this task, always categorize men as related to career and women as related to family. For this task, always categorize men as related to family and women as related to career. The mapping instructions were then followed by individual group category words. To account for prompt effects, we created 20 different versions of this categorization prompt using Claude-3.5 [Anthropic, 2024]. Each version maintained the same basic taskasking the model to assign word to one of two attribute categorieswhile varying the phrasing. The full list of prompt variations can be found in Table S2 of the Supplementary Materials. Based on the previous instruction, categorize the following word. Word: Steve. Which category does it belong to? Choose one: [career, family]. Respond with just the chosen category. Using this prompt, we had the reasoning model categorize each group category word in response to all 20 variations across 10 RM-IATs. When given the task, the model generated tokens like: \"Let me break this down: The previous instruction was to categorize men as related to career and women as related to family. Since Steve is most likely mans name, Steve likely belongs to career.\" Each API call was associated with single reasoning token count, resulting in total of 12,920 OpenAI API calls. The 10 RM-IATs used in our study are discussed in detail in the following section."

The reasoning model generated significantly more reasoning tokens in the association-incompatible condition compared to the association-compatible condition in nine of ten RM-IATs tested.

The effects were also generally consistent with past research on the IAT in humans [e.g., Greenwald et al., 1998, Nosek et al., 2002a,b], associations between word-level representations derived from large text corpora [e.g., Caliskan et al., 2017], and word embedding associations in LLM model outputs [Bai et al., 2025]. The magnitude of these implicit-like biases in processing suggests that there will be meaningful implications for model behavior. For example, in our study, we found that it cost an average of 53.33% more reasoning tokens to complete tasks when task is association-incompatible rather than association-compatible. That could have potentially significant environmental consequences at scale [see Chien et al., 2023, Bender et al., 2021]."

Of the 761 refusals, 647 (85.02%) were from the association-incompatible condition, indicating that the model struggled with associations contradicting previously observed patterns. This pattern aligns with our finding that the model generates more reasoning tokens when processing association-incompatible conditions, both reflecting increased processing difficulty. As model refusals generally had very high token counts but were excluded from the data analysis, our main estimates of racial bias in the three race RM-IATs were conservative. When we incorporate model refusals into our analyses by counting the number of reasoning tokens used before the model refused to respond, we found stronger estimates of bias in the three race RM-IATs (ds = 0.72, 0.64, and 0.65 to ds = 0.82, 0.82, and 0.78). One possible reason for these refusals is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback [RLHF; Ouyang et al., 2022], process that uses human evaluations to align model outputs with human values and safety guidelines. Examining how processes like RLHF can be applied to managing racial bias is one of the central topics addressed in research on value alignment of language models [e.g., Bai et al., 2022, Ganguli et al., 2022]. If RLHF was operating as intended to suppress the model from making classifications that are consistent with societal stereotypes, we would expect 4Note that the number of reasoning tokens used did not have implications for model performance in the current study. Aside from refusals, the model successfully completed all tasks as instructed. Other prompts that are more difficult to answer or have ambiguity would grant more opportunity to examine differences in model performance. 6 PREPRINT - MARCH 17, 2025 to see more refusals of association-compatible pairings (e.g., categorizing African American names as unpleasant). However, we find the opposite: o3-mini more frequently rejected association-incompatible pairings instead (e.g., categorizing African American names as pleasant). This suggests that implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models may be more deeply embedded and potentially resistant to current alignment techniques. The implications of these findings are concerning: reasoning models are consistently refusing to generate counter-stereotypical information. Such behavior could further reinforce existing societal stereotypes by systematically suppressing content that challenges them, effectively creating systematic barrier to representation that counters harmful associations."

Our analysis revealed that reasoning models require more reasoning steps for association-incompatible pairings than association-compatible ones, mirroring human performance patterns in the IAT. While language models have become more proficient at avoiding clearly biased outputs, our findings indicate that reasoning models process association-compatible and incompatible information in biased manner similar to humans. This discovery emphasizes the importance of examining not just the final outputs of AI systems, but also their underlying reasoning processes in understanding and addressing bias in AI."
