            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate language. This training text includes large portion of written human knowledge such as books, newspapers, Wikipedia, and scientific articles. During this process, LLMs also retain remarkable amount of the information seen during pre-training, allowing them to encode real-world knowledge in their parameters and act as knowledge bases [Petroni et al., 2019, Roberts et al., 2020, Cohen et al., 2023a, Pan et al., 2023]. Owing to this phenomenon, LLMs can be used in multiple settings requiring this real-world knowledge, such as closed-book question answering [Brown et al., 2020, Roberts et al., 2020] and information retrieval [Tay et al., 2022]. Despite the popularity of LLMs, they are prone to what is commonly referred to as hallucinations, which severely hinder their performance and reliability [Ji et al., 2023, Manduchi et al., 2024]. Examples of hallucinations include factually incorrect [Maynez et al., 2020, Devaraj et al., 2022, Tam et al., 2023], inconsistent [Elazar et al., 2021, MÃ¼ndler et al., 2023], self-contradicting [Cohen et al., 2024] or non-attributable text [Bohnet et al., 2022, Rashkin et al., 2023, Yue et al., 2023]. prominent method employed to combat such hallucinations is model calibration [Guo et al., 2017a, Brundage et al., 2020], which aims to calibrate the confidence of model predictions such that they 1We release our code and IDK-tuned model checkpoints at https://github.com/roi-hpi/ IDK-token-tuning. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed IDK objective. During continual pretraining, we shift some probability mass of wrong predictions towards special [IDK] token. The amount of shifted probability mass depends on the uncertainty in the models prediction. We detail our method in Section 2. are better aligned with their quality. This calibration allows LLMs to explicitly express uncertainty, allowing them to caveat their responses or even refrain from answering. Although many of the proposed methods do lead to an improvement in model calibration [Geng et al., 2024], they have still been found to be lacking [Chen et al., 2023]. In this work, we propose novel objective function that allows LLMs to explicitly express uncertainty. We add new special [IDK] (I Dont Know) token to the vocabulary of the language model. During continued pretraining phase, we modify the conventional cross-entropy objective to express uncertainty in next-token prediction as probability mass on the [IDK] token. Specifically, each time the model fails to predict the gold label, some of the probability mass of the target is shifted to the [IDK] token based on an Uncertainty Factor we calculate based on the predicted logits. We refer to our method as IDK-tuning. Our proposed IDK objective differs from previous work as we intervene during continued pretraining phase with the language modeling task. Crucially, we do not rely on any labeled data. Moreover, this allows the model to be later finetuned on specific tasks while the model has already learned to express uncertainty. We conduct IDK-tuning using various model architectures and sizes, and then evaluate them on diverse factual downstream tasks. Our results show large increase in factual precision of IDK-tuned models while causing only small decrease in recall of factual knowledge that was contained in the base model. We conduct extensive ablation studies for the individual components of our IDK objective and analyze its effect on optimization dynamics. We finally show that IDK-tuning does not harm the general language modeling ability of models, such as long text generation. In summary, our contributions include: We propose novel IDK objective applied during pretraining which models uncertainty in models prediction as probability mass put on special [IDK] token. We evaluate our objective using large range of base models with different architectures and model sizes, and confirm the efficacy of IDK-tuning on range of factual answering downstream tasks. We extensively analyze individual components of our objective and its effect on general language modeling ability. IDK-tuning Our goal is to train model to be aware of its unawareness and to effectively express it. For this, we introduce new special token to its vocabulary: [IDK]. The model is intended to express uncertainty by putting probability mass on the [IDK] token in its predictions. In practice, we adapt the models pretraining objective, aiming to teach it to use the [IDK] token effectively. Our objective does not require annotations of uncertainty or specifically crafted datasets (e.g., Q&A). Instead, we leverage the uncertainty captured by the pretraining objective on its pretraining data and use it to encourage probability mass on the [IDK] token in cases of uncertainty. We hypothesize that this generalizes to uncertainty expressed on downstream tasks like Q&A, which we experimentally verify later on. We next describe in detail the technicalities of the [IDK] token and our training method. 2 2.1 The [IDK] token The purpose of the new token is to represent lack of knowledge. Ideally, whenever the model would have been making mistake, we want it to instead predict this token. That is, rather than generating wrong token, we would like to model to generate the [IDK] token, as means of conveying its uncertainty. We can consider this as model expressing its lack of knowledge and may then choose to ignore its outputs. The more the model opts for this token rather than predicting the wrong answer, the more we improve the models precision. For instance, let us consider the setup of Factual Sentence Completion. In this setup, the model receives an incomplete sentence as an input and is expected to complete it factually. For example, valid input would be Paris is the capital of, and factually correct output by the model would be France. In this setup, if the model was going to predict Germany, using the [IDK] token instead increases factual precision by refusing to answer question where the answer would have been wrong. Naturally, almost universally predicting [IDK] indiscriminately may yield high precision but is not helpful. Therefore, taking into account the recall of factually correct answers is crucial in evaluating our method. We analyze both the precision and recall of our method in Section 4. We add this new [IDK] token to the models vocabulary and initialize its embedding randomly. The embedding is optimized alongside the rest of the models parameters during training. We next describe our proposed IDK objective. 2.2 The IDK Training Objective We modify the conventional cross-entropy objective between the softmax distribution over the models prediction and the correct answer, such that each time the model fails to predict the correct token, it is encouraged to instead put some probability mass on the [IDK]. This encouragement is modulated by an Uncertainty Factor denoted as Î» [0, 1] that is larger the more uncertain the model is and exactly 0 when the model predicts the correct token. We now define our modified cross-entropy objective. We use [gold] to denote the gold token (correct target) for each prediction. We denote the probability mass assigned to an arbitrary token [tok] in the prediction of model as prob(yt = [tok] y<t, x) We further use 1[IDK] to denote one-hot target vector with one at the index of the [IDK] token. Per convention, denotes the one-hot target vector for the [gold] token. The modified objective is defined as follows: IDK = CE(Ëy, (1 Î») + Î» 1[IDK]) (1) If the model is uncertain in its prediction, the target is shifted away from predicting the [gold] token and towards the [IDK] token. This is modulated by Î». Note that in case the model makes the correct prediction, Î» = 0 and IDK therefore reduces to the regular cross-entropy loss. When the model is correct, IDK provides both the signal for the correct prediction and signal to express uncertainty. We now detail the construction of the Uncertainty Factor Î». IDK simply provides the signal for the correct prediction. When the model is incorrect, The Uncertainty Factor. Î» is constructed as scalar weight with Î» [0, 1]. Intuitively, we want Î» to be close to 1 when the model is very uncertain and 0 when the model makes the correct prediction. Based on this, we define Î» as one minus the probability mass on the gold token divided by the maximum probability mass put on any token: Î» = Î  (cid:18) 1 prob(yt = [gold] y<t, x) maxi(prob(yt = y<t, x)) (cid:19) , (2) [0, 1] is hyperparameter to control the influence of our objective. When the gold where Î  token probability is close to the maximum probability, Î» is close to 0. If the model makes correct prediction (the gold token is assigned the maximum probability), Î» is 0, thereby reducing Equation 1 to the regular cross-entropy loss. When the gold token probability is much lower than the maximum probability, Î» is close to 1, which translates to shifting almost all the probability mass of the target in Equation 1 to the [IDK] token. Î  specifies the upper bound of target probability mass that can be shifted to the [IDK] token. For example, Î  = 1 2 means that at most half of the probability mass in the target can be shifted to [IDK] while the rest remains with the gold token. In practice, we do not tune this and set Î  = 1 2 . This prevents the [IDK] token from ever becoming better prediction than the gold token while still providing enough signal to predict [IDK] for uncertain predictions. We perform an ablation of the influence of Î  in Section 4.2. Uncertainty Regularization. An important consideration in designing the IDK objective is to prevent collapse where the model is miscalibrated with too many false positive [IDK]s, putting too much probability mass on [IDK], although it could have made the correct prediction. Therefore, we add the following anti-false positive regularization to our objective: FP-reg = log(1 prob(yt = [IDK] y<t, x)), (3) which is exactly the binary cross-entropy objective with 0 as the target and the probability mass assigned to the [IDK] as the input. We only add this regularization objective when the models prediction is correct. This aims to minimize the [IDK] tokens probability mass the model learns to predict in cases it knows the answer thus teaching it to minimize the use of this token in cases it is more certain, and is designed to reduce decrease of its recall. We perform an ablation of FP-reg in Section 4.2. The final loss. Combining all objectives, our final IDK objective is therefore: = (cid:26) CE + IDK FP-reg if Î» = 0 otherwise. (4)"

            "content": "We use our proposed IDK objective to tune various pretrained models to use the new [IDK] token. We dub this process IDK-tuning. We then report the results of the IDK-tuned models on commonly used factual benchmarks, showing that our method improves factuality while paying only small price in terms of knowledge recall. We also show that model size plays significant role in the success of our method to create an effective uncertainty-aware model. We employ continual training of pretrained models rather than training from scratch for two reasons: (i) the computational cost of training models that perform competitively on current benchmarks from scratch would be prohibitive, and (ii) starting from model that is already strong language modeler helps during the optimization process by providing rough initial calibration that we utilize to derive the Uncertainty Factor. 3.1 IDK-tuning Setup We use bert-base-cased [Devlin et al., 2019], mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 [Jiang et al., 2023], and EleutherAI/pythia-70m 2.8B [Biderman et al., 2023] for our base models for IDK-tuning. For IDK-tuning Mistral-7B-v0.1, we train on data randomly sampled from The Pile [Gao et al., 2020]2 with context length of 4,096. We use example packing to fill the entire context length. We 105 with linear warmup for 10% of the training steps and use maximum learning rate of 4 106. We use batch size of 256, weight decay of 0.05, gradient clipping cosine decay down to 2 of 1.0 and AdamW betas (0.9, 0.95). We train for 1,024 optimizer steps resulting in total of 1B training tokens. For the pythia-70m 2.8B models, we use the same hyperparameters but reduce the context length to 2,048 to match the models positional embeddings. We use bfloat16 and float16 mixed-precision training to match Mistral-7B-v0.1 and pythia-410m 2.8B pretraining, respectively. For pythia-70m, pythia-160m and bert-base-cased, we observed NaN errors in the predicted logits irrespective of our loss modifications. Since the models are small enough, we switch to pure float32 for these models without using mixed-precision. In addition, for bert-base-cased we apply MLM [Devlin et al., 2019], while for each input, we randomly mask one of the tokens. 2We use monology/pile-uncopyrighted on the Huggingface Hub for version of The Pile without the Books corpus, which contains copyrighted works. 4 3.2 Evaluation Setup Evaluation Data. We consider the following datasets: LAMA [Petroni et al., 2019], TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017], and PopQA [Mallen et al., 2022]. These cover wide range of queries, for example trivia questions (TriviaQA), and subject-relation-object facts phrased as queries (LAMA, PopQA). We consider the closed-book open-ended setting, where we do not provide any context or answer choices to the model. Importantly, in the case of TriviaQA and PopQA, where the input is formed as question, we reduce it into sentence completion task, using GPT4. Specifically, we prompt it to phrase the question as sentence, while also providing it with some in-context examples that we manually created. See Appendix for more details and the full prompt. To evaluate multiple-choice question answering, we use EleutherAIs lm-evaluation-harness [Gao et al., 2023]. Specifically, we use ARC [Clark et al., 2018], HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019], MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2020], TruthfulQA [Lin et al., 2022a], WinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021], and GSM8k [Cobbe et al., 2021]. Baselines. For each of the evaluation datasets, we compare the IDK-tuned model with its original base model without any further training. Furthermore, we consider three different baselines: 1. confidence-based baseline: We use the predicted probability mass in the language modeling head of the LM as measure of confidence in the prediction [Yoshikawa and Okazaki, 2023]. We consider the first token generated by the LM. In case the corresponding probability mass of this token is greater than fixed threshold, we consider the generation as valid. Otherwise, we consider this as an uncertainty expression (analogous to an [IDK] token generation in our model). To create strong baseline, we search for the best threshold via hyperparameter tuning on the development set. 2. P(True) baseline [Kadavath et al., 2022]: Given an input sentence to complete, which we refer to as I, we use the original model to generate the completion, which we refer to as A. We then concatenate and and ask the model: \"Please answer either with true or false only. Is it true that: IA\". If the model answer is not true, we consider this specific example as unknown for the model namely the same case as if the IDK-tuned model would generate the [IDK]. 3. Semantic Entropy baseline [Kuhn et al., 2023, Aichberger et al., 2024]: We sample text generations from the model, encode them using state-of-the-art semantic encoder and cluster their encodings. If the largest cluster size is larger than 2 , then we take random generation out of this cluster as the models answer. Otherwise, we consider this example as unknown. Evaluation. We evaluate how well our models use the new [IDK] token by measuring their factuality and knowledge memory, using the following metrics: (i) Precision: the portion of factually correct completions, out of all the claims that have been completed with any token that is different from the [IDK] token, i.e., the claims that the model was certain enough about, and tried to factually complete. (ii) Recall: the portion of factually correct completions, out of all the claims in the dataset. Namely, the portion of knowledge memory the model has, out of the entire test set we evaluate on. (iii) F1: the harmonic mean of precision and recall. In the case of base models without additional calibration methods, the precision, recall, and F1-scores all correspond to their accuracy on the task. In Section 4.2, we use two further metrics to analyze the patterns when IDK-tuned models predict [IDK]. For this, we use the notion of correctly predicting [IDK]: We consider an [IDK] prediction to be correct if the base model does not predict the correct answer for an instance. We define (i) IDK recall: the fraction of instances the model predicted [IDK] correctly out of all instances where the base model did in fact not predict the correct answer, and (ii) IDK error rate: the fraction of instances where the model predicted [IDK] incorrectly out of all instances where the base model did indeed predict the correct answer."

Table 1 shows the results of our largest model Mistral-7B-v0.1 on factual closed-book sentence completion datasets. Our results show that the IDK-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.1 has much higher precision namely the model generates significantly fewer factually incorrect completions and instead puts probability mass on the [IDK] token. However, the model does show decreased knowledge recall on some tasks. Overall, we observe an increase in the average F1-score. Table 2 shows the averaged results on the lm-eval-harness datasets. The trend here is similar, although the increase in precision compared to baselines is slightly lower. This suggests that the model tends to be more certain when it comes to multiple-choice questions. Scaling behavior of IDK-tuning. We further investigate the effect of model size on the success of IDK-tuning. We conduct IDK-tuning for each of the pythia-70m 2.8B models as detailed in Section 3.1. In Figure 2, we plot the average precision, recall, and F1-score for each of pythia-70m 2.8B as well as Mistral-7B-v0.1, over all the closed-book sentence completion datasets. We observe clear trend of recall and F1-score increasing log-linearly with the model size. The precision of IDK-tuned models increases only slightly as the model size increases. For the two smallest models we investigate (pythia-70m and pythia-160m), our method is arguably not effective, as the IDK-tuned models recall collapses (we further analyze this in Section 4.3). Figure 2: Average performance on closed-book factual sentence completion benchmarks of IDKtuned models in terms of their parameter count. 70m to 2.8B are pythia-70m 2.8B, while 7.0B is Mistral-7B-v0.1. 6 bert-base-cased bert-base-cased + Confidence Treshold bert-base-cased + IDK-tuning LAMA Google-RE LAMA T-Rex LAMA SQuAD 23.0 58.8 78.1 23.0 15.8 15.9 F1 23.0 24.9 59.8 71. 26.4 72.5 59.8 35.9 53.0 59.8 47.8 9.5 69.5 61.2 80.2 9.5 5.0 6.4 F1 9.5 9.3 11.9 Table 3: Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1 scores for of our IDK-tuned bert-base-cased on the evaluation benchmarks, compared to baselines.

Table 3 reports the results of out IDK-tuned bert-base-cased model. We see similar trend as in our evaluation of Mistral-7B-v0.1. Factuality is improved, while recall is reduced by only small amount. 4.2 Ablations We perform an ablation study of our method to further investigate the effectiveness of each of its components. For our study, we calculate the IDK recall and IDK error rate on the closed-book factual sentence completion datasets. We study the effect of Î , Î» and the FP-reg term. For this, we perform IDK-tuning using Mistral-7B-v0.1 with the same hyperparameters as our main runs with different combinations of the studied components3. We plot the IDK recall for different values of Î  in Figure 3. In Figure 4, we plot the IDK recall vs. IDK error rate tradeoff. IDK recall and IDK error rate are defined in Section 3.2. We study different aspects of these results below: 1. Analysis of the adaptive nature of the Uncertainty Factor Î». The Uncertainty Factor Î» defined in Equation 2 is adaptive, meaning the amount of probability mass shifted to [IDK] depends on the predicted probability distribution. Another possible choice is to use fixed Î» [0, 1]. We analyze this in Figure 3 and Figure 44. We can see that using the adaptive Î» formulation results in lower IDK error rate without major decrease in IDK recall. 2. Effect of the tion 2.2). Again, we see that using recall significantly. FP-reg regularization. We also study the effect of the FP-reg term (see SecFP-reg results in reduced IDK error rate without decreasing IDK 3Due to computational constraints, we run this for reduced set of Î  for the cases with adaptive Î». 4For fixed Î», we set Î» = Î . 7 3. Effect of the upper bound hyperparameter Î . We also study the effect of Î , which is the upper bound of the Uncertainty Factor (see Equation 2). Our ablation study demonstrates that increasing Î  results in an increase in correct predictions of [IDK] (higher IDK recall), at the cost of small increase of erroneous [IDK] predictions (IDK error rate). The IDK error rate increases less when using both our proposed adaptive Î» and FP-reg. Effect of knowledge contained in The Pile. Since we conduct further pretraining on The Pile, improved performance of our method could be partly explained by additional knowledge that the model learns during IDK-tuning. However, we show that this is not the case. In the case of the pythia-70m 2.8B models, our data used for IDK-tuning exactly matches their pretraining data. For Mistral-7B-v0.1, this is not known although The Pile was likely also included. We note that the language modeling performance on The Pile of our models during IDK-tuning actually very slightly decreases rather than improving, suggesting the absence of any newly learned knowledge. However, to completely rule out any such effects, we trained Mistral-7B-v0.1 on the exact sample of The Pile used for IDK-tuning but with the regular cross-entropy objective. We report the performance of this model in Table 1. Indeed, Mistral-7B-v0.1 with further training on The Pile performs similarly to the base Mistral-7B-v0.1 on average."

            "content": "Collapse to [IDK]. Highly optimizing every component of the standard language modeling task with Transformers has made it easy to forget that optimization processes of deep neural networks can be brittle and divergent. Naively replacing the regular cross-entropy objective with our IDK-loss IDK leads to collapse of training where the model simply always learns to put most probability mass on the [IDK]. We already account for this by (i) introducing the Î  inhibitor to allow us to set an upper bound on the maximum probability mass that is assigned to the [IDK] in the target vector and (ii) introducing the additional FP-reg regularization to provide an additional signal that punishes probability mass being assigned to [IDK] when the models prediction is already correct. In practice, we see that the regular cross-entropy loss shows small uptick at the very beginning of IDK-tuning. In almost all runs, this recovers quickly back to baseline levels, where it remains. We find that with Î  = 0.5 and the FP-reg regularization, most training runs are stable without further model-specific tuning. Collapse for small models pythia-70m and pythia-160m. However, for pythia-160m and pythia-70m, which are the only runs in our experiments that diverge even with our added regularization losses, the regular cross-entropy keeps on rising with large spike. Concretely, the predicted distributions not only show an increased cross-entropy with the targets but also sharply increasing entropy: we observe that the predicted distributions collapse towards uniform distribution. At the worst point, 0% of the predictions of pythia-160m are correct. However, both models somewhat recover towards the end of training but stay well below baseline levels in terms of language modeling performance. We note that this is different collapse pattern than the collapse towards almost always predicting [IDK] observed without our regularization terms. We further analyzed this and observe that for both pythia-160m and pythia-70m, the initial probability mass assigned to the [IDK] token is so small that it gets rounded to zero even when using float32 precision. This causes the IDK loss to be very large, resulting in large gradient norms. Already for pythia-410m, the initial probability mass on [IDK] is substantial enough to prevent 109). Both pythia-160m and pythia-70m also this (albeit still very small value smaller than 5 show larger initial entropy in their predicted distributions (i.e., flatter predicted distributions). We conjecture that an adapted initialization of the [IDK] token and/or small bias towards [IDK] at the beginning of training could prevent this divergence. As we only encounter this issue for the small pythia-160m and pythia-70m models, we leave further investigation of this for future work. 4.4 Text Generation To assess whether our IDK-tuning might harm other different downstream language skills, which are not necessarily only factual, we evaluate the IDK-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.1 on the task of text summarization, and compare its results to those of the original model. For this, due to the high likelihood of the [IDK] token being generated during longer text generation process, we use greedy decoding and ignore the [IDK] token. For this experiment, we use four different common 8 Legal Plain English TLDR SPEC5G Mistral-7B-v0.1 Mistral-7B-v0.1 + The Pile Mistral-7B-v0.1 + IDK-tuning on The Pile 17.5 17.4 17.2 14.1 14.1 14.0 37.2 37.3 36.9 Table 4: RougeL scores on different summarization tasks to measure the impact of IDK-tuning on other language model abilities.

We measure performance using RougleL [Lin, 2004], as it is widely used in related work, and report the results in Table 4. The IDK-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.1 performs only slightly worse than the original base model. This is an encouraging result, as it means that IDK-tuning does not necessarily harm other language skills of pretrained language models. 4.5 Error Analysis To gauge the effect of IDK-tuning on model responses to factual prompts and questions, we conduct an in-depth manual analysis on random sample of 200 (40 from each dataset) of the models incorrect generations (generations that do not contain the correct answer). We conduct this analysis for three models across model sizes: pythia-70m, pythia-2.8B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1. We then categorize each of these incorrect generations to one of the following categories: 1. No Effect: Both the original model and the IDK-tuned model generate the same (incorrect) answer. 2. Noise: The original model generates the correct answer, while the IDK-tuned model does not. 3. White Noise: Both the original and IDK-tuned models do not generate the correct answer, however the IDK-tuned model generates different one. 4. Abstain: The IDK-tuned model abstains from answering by generating text such as unknown\" or mystery\". The results are shown in Table 5. Our analysis suggest that first, the bigger the model, the fewer changes our training approach causes in the models generations, and second, the bigger the model, the greater its ability to abstain from answering via words (which generally can be interpreted as equal to generating an [IDK] token, although harder to evaluate automatically)."

            "content": "Model Calibration. Our goal is closely related to the key challenge of model calibration [Guo et al., 2017b]: to provide measure of the probability that prediction is incorrect alongside the actual prediction. The problem of factual error detection can be viewed as variation of calibration, where instead of continuous probability, we provide binary prediction for whether the model is correct or not. This is also related to the setting of selective prediction, where models can abstain from answering query [Varshney et al., 2022, Kamath et al., 2020]. Common approaches to calibration are to perform various transformations on models output logits [Desai and Durrett, 2020, Jiang et al., 2021], and measuring uncertainty [e.g., see Kuhn et al., 2023]. More recent works have studied the use of LMs for providing calibration, by training them on statements known to be factually 9 correct or incorrect. This supervised approach has been explored via fine-tuning [Kadavath et al., 2022, Lin et al., 2022b], in-context learning [Cohen et al., 2023a, Alivanistos et al., 2022], zero-shot instruction-oriented [Cohen et al., 2023b] and consistency sampling [Yoran et al., 2023] techniques. more recent work [Azaria and Mitchell, 2023] uses the internal state of the model for classifying whether it is certain or not. Our work builds upon this, aiming to teach the model to assess and express its own uncertainty via the new [IDK] token we introduced. Attribution. Another related line of work focuses on checking whether LM-generated texts are faithful to given source text [Bohnet et al., 2022, Honovich et al., 2022]. This problem has been addressed via several approaches, including question generation [Wang et al., 2020, Honovich et al., 2021, Scialom et al., 2021], NLI [Thorne et al., 2018, Welleck et al., 2019, Maynez et al., 2020, Dziri et al., 2022, Gao et al., 2022, Kamoi et al., 2023], data augmentation [Atanasova et al., 2022, Wright et al., 2022, Gekhman et al., 2023], and planning schemes that allow the model to self-edit its own generation [Schick et al., 2022]. Unlike these works, we are not assuming any reference text or external knowledge bases. Instead, we aim to teach the model to decide on its own whether it is likely to be able to factually complete sentence correctly."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "We propose novel method for improving LMs factuality by adding special [IDK] token to an LMs vocabulary. Alongside the new [IDK] token, we introduce novel pretraining objective called IDK-tuning to model uncertainty in the models prediction as the probability mass assigned to the [IDK]. Crucially, IDK-tuning requires no labeled data and is instead drop-in replacement of the conventional cross-entropy loss used for self-supervised language modeling on web-crawled texts. This allows us to explore uncertainty-aware training at large scale. In our experiments, we conduct continued pretraining of diverse range of pretrained models using the IDK objective. Evaluation on factual sentence completion and multiple-choice benchmarks shows that IDK-tuned models can complete these tasks with much higher precision by refusing to answer (assigning high probability mass to the [IDK] token) in cases when the base model would have given wrong answer. This comes at only small decreases in recall. We investigate the scaling behavior of our method with respect to model size using the Pythia model suite [Biderman et al., 2023], perform several ablation studies for individual components of our IDK objective, and verify that the general language modeling ability of IDK-tuned models does not degrade. Our work can be extended in several ways. For example, since we do not rely on any labels of our training data used for IDK-tuning, we potentially apply our objective for next-token predictions where it might be ill-posed. Instead, we can perform lightweight filtering of relevant next-token predictions, such as named entities, focusing our objective more on factual next-token predictions. Also, IDK-tuning can be applied during pretraining from scratch, where our IDK objective could have interesting interactions with the acquisition of new knowledge during this stage."

            "title": "7 Limitations",
            "content": "We note few limitations of our proposed method. First, it requires full pretraining of LMs on relatively large corpus. This of course is both highly computationally expensive and time-consuming. It is likely often the case that this kind of training cannot be conducted on typical academic lab resources, on large enough model, in reasonable amount of time. Second, as discussed in Section 4.4, our method may slightly harm certain language skills, such as long text generation. Other downstream skills may be affected more significantly. We further discuss potential risk and biases in Appendix A."

            "content": "As discussed in Section 1, one of the main disadvantages of current LMs is their tendency to factually mislead the user by generating factual incorrect statements. Hence, the main impact of our work is to reduce such factual mistakes via our proposed method. Still, it is evident that this sort of approach can by no means completely eliminate hallucinations. It is important to stress that we propose single method, not system design for safe deployment of LLMs. In practice, we anticipate our method to be coupled with other checks and balances, forming safe system. Additionally, in this work, we use The Pile as dataset to train models. The Pile is web-crawled corpus, which likely harbors text reflecting various forms of biases. One impact of applying IDKtuning is that the model may learn to answer in biased way if this bias appears in its training data, while avoiding answers that rarely appear in its training data. This shows the need for more research on compiling high-quality training corpora."

            "title": "NeurIPS Paper Checklist",
            "content": "1. Claims Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the papers contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: For all claims made in the abstract and introduction, we provide experimental results that back these claims. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Section 7. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. The authors are encouraged to create separate \"Limitations\" section in their paper. The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on few datasets or with few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that arent acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not include new theoretical results that warrant proofs. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced. All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide short proof sketch to provide intuition. Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 4. Experimental Result Reproducibility Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the formulation of our objective in Section 2 and hyperparameters as well as further details to reproduce our trainings in Section 3.1. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. If the paper includes experiments, No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. If the contribution is dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to hosted model (e.g., in the case of large language model), releasing of model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is new model (e.g., large language model), then there should either be way to access this model for reproducing the results or way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results. 5. Open access to data and code Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? 19 Answer: [No] Justification: We will publish all datasets, code, and model checkpoints with camera-ready version. Guidelines: The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so No is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for new open-source benchmark). The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. 6. Experimental Setting/Details Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide these details in Section 3.1. See also our answer to question 4. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material. 7. Experiment Statistical Significance Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: Our evaluations are done via prompting rather than fine-tuning (see Section 3.2), yielding no source of randomness to aggregate into error bars. Our large-scale continual training experiments are, unfortunately, too expensive to repeat multiple times with different random seeds. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The authors should answer \"Yes\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). 20 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to library function, bootstrap, etc.) The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report 2-sigma error bar than state that they have 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. 8. Experiments Compute Resources Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide those details in APPENDIX (see Appendix B). Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didnt make it into the paper). 9. Code Of Ethics Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We carefully read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics document and made sure its aligned with our work. One potential impact is discussed in Appendix A. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require deviation from the Code of Ethics. The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction). 10. Broader Impacts Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the potential social impacts in Appendix A. Guidelines: The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. 21 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). 11. Safeguards Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We only continually pretrain already public models on up to 1B tokens. We believe that the resulting checkpoints do not warrant additional safeguards. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. Released models that have high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make best faith effort. 12. Licenses for existing assets Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Section 3, we mention and cite each of the models, datasets, and training technuiqs we used in our work. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include URL. The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. For scraped data from particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of dataset. For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the assets creators. 13. New Assets Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we properly explained each of the new assets we introduced. Additionally, in Appendix C, we provide the complete prompt we used in order to create our closed-booked sentence completion dataset as discussed in Section 3.2. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. 14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No crowdsourcing experiments with human subjects were conducted. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: No study with human participants was conducted. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. 23 Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review."
