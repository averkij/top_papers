Training data was curated from textbooks, public datasets, clinical records, medical guidelines, and hospitals. The process involved data preprocessing, annotation generation, and final clinician review. Our dataset comprises four types: multi-choice QA, open-ended QA, multi-round dialogues, and reports. Spinal disorders (Ferreira et al., 2023), including degenerative diseases (like disc herniation) (Dydyk et al., 2017), deformities (like scoliosis) (Negrini et al., 2018), trauma (fractures) (Vaccaro et al., 2013), and inflammatory conditions (Taurog et al., 2016), are major driver of pain, disability, and surgical care worldwide. key challenge in their management is diagnostic complexity. Unlike many other disorders, spinal conditions typically cannot be precisely diagnosed using single imaging modality. It often requires clinicians to perform level-aware, multimodal reasoning: integrating findings from X-ray, CT, and MRI to pinpoint pathology at specific vertebral levels, grade severity, and plan interventions (Teichner et al., 2025). The precision of this interpretation directly impacts patient outcomes and neurological safety. Although advanced AI holds great promise for augmenting this demanding workflow (Ibrahim et al., 2025b), its potential has been hindered. Fortunately, such clinical tasks can significantly benefit from advanced AI capabilities (Lee et al., 2024b). Yet progress is constrained not by model capacity, but by the absence of traceable instruction data and standardized, clinically validated benchmarks tailored to spine workflows (Lee et al., 2024b). Equally important, prior efforts rarely embed clinicians throughout the pipeline, limiting practical utility. We present SpineMed: comprehensive effort consisting of SpineMed-450k, provenance-rich instruction corpus for spine diagnosis and planning, and SpineBench, targeted evaluation suite that help to evaluate the effectiveness of different AI-based spine diagnosis. To our best knowledge, this is current largest-scale Spinal diagnosis and treatment dataset. Both were co-designed with spine clinicians (radiologists and surgeons) to reflect real decision points. SpineMed-450k aggregates materials from textbooks, surgical guidelines, expert consensuses, question banks, open spine datasets (e.g., Spark, VerSe) (Alibaba Cloud Tianchi, 2020; Sekuboyina et al., 2021), open-access case reports (Europe PMC) (Consortium, 2015), and 1,000 de-identified hospital cases. Throughout curation, clinicians (i) defined inclusion criteria and task taxonomies; (ii) vetted imaging selections from hospital cases to prioritize views most informative for diagnosis and surgical planning; and (iii) specified failure modes that instruction data must surface. To minimize hallucinations and preserve traceability, our pipeline (a) extracts figures and text with PaddleOCR (Du et al., 2020); (b) binds images to their local textual context via caption-pattern regex matching that anchors each figure to its surrounding paragraph; and (c) distills high-quality supervisionmultiple-choice, open-ended QA, multi-turn consultations, and report generationthrough two-stage LLM process (draft revision with explicit prompts and logs). Clinicians review and refine prompt policies and revision criteria to align with reporting standards. SpineBench operationalizes evaluation across clinically relevant axesimaging report, diagnosis, patient guidance, evidence-based treatment, technical feasibility, risk prognosis, coverage, relevance, granularity, and interpretability. Its item design, error taxonomy, and rubrics were developed with clinician input to emphasize fine-grained, anatomy-centric reasoning and the kinds of mistakes that matter in practice. To characterize the state of the field, we evaluate dozen of contemporary large visionlanguage models (LVLMs) (OpenAI, 2025a;b; Hurst et al., 2024; Google, 2025a;b; Sellergren et al., 2025; xAI, 2025; Anthropic, 2025; Bai et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a), both general-purpose and medical. Our evaluation reveals significant weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific diagnosis and open-ended clinical reasoning, particularly in the handling of complex multi-image tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce fine-tuned spine model SpineGPT trained on SpineMed-450k that delivers consistent improvements on SpineBench as shown in Figure 1. Clinicians assess exemplar outputs for decision relevance, underscoring the practical value of targeted, evidence-linked instruction data. Our contributions are as follows: Clinician-in-the-loop dataset and benchmark. We release SpineMed-450k, more than 450,000 instruction instances spanning multiple-choice, open-ended QA, multi-turn consultations, and report generationcurated via specialist-supported pipeline with anatomical integration and two-stage report refinement, together with SpineBench, level-aware benchmark co-designed with clinicians and enriched with 1,000 real hospital cases. Comprehensive evaluation. We benchmark dozens of open-source LVLMs across closed/open tasks using clinician-shaped taxonomies and rubrics, surfacing systematic failure modes in spine reasoning. practical baseline model. We propose fine-tuned spine LVLM trained on SpineMed450k that achieves consistent gains on SpineBench; exemplar outputs receive clinician feedback on diagnostic clarity and planning utility, establishing high-utility baseline for future research."

Existing general-purpose large vision-language models (Hurst et al., 2024; Google, 2025a;b; Deng et al., 2023; Ullah et al., 2024; AlSaad et al., 2024) and even medical large language models (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2024; Niu et al., 2025; Nath et al., 2025a; Seyfioglu et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025) are trained on generic medical data (Chen et al., 2024a;b; Xie et al., 2024a), which often lacks the high-quality, specialized data needed for orthopedics (Deng et al., 2023; Ullah et al., 2024). To train an effective large model for spinal care, we first compiled high-quality, general orthopedic dataset covering multiple domains, including Spine Surgery, Foot and Ankle Surgery, Orthopedic Trauma, and Hand and Upper Extremity Surgery. As shown in Figure 3, we integrated materials from variety of sources, including textbooks, surgical guidelines, expert consensuses, question banks, open-access case reports from Europe PMC (Consortium, 2015), open single-modality spine datasets (Alibaba Cloud Tianchi, 2020; Sekuboyina et al., 2021) (e.g., Spark, VerSe), and approximately 1,000 de-identified multimodal hospital cases collected from various hospitals. This data covers wide range of modalities, including text, CT, MRI, X-ray, and tables. We track the provenance (dataset IDs/DOIs, case identifiers) for every derived item. Where possible, we adopt upstream datasets with permissive licenses and clear terms of reuse. Clinicians defined the inclusion criteria and, for hospital cases, selected the most decision-informative images (e.g., MRI target sequences, key CT levels) to serve as the foundation for downstream tasks."

This approach effectively preserved the structural integrity of the documents, including tables, figure placements, and overall layout. Furthermore, to ensure precise mapping between figures, their captions, and corresponding contextual descriptions in the text, we developed novel algorithm termed Picture Context Matching. The technical details of this algorithm are elaborated in the Appendix B.4. Data De-identification and Cleaning This stage focused on processing data sourced from collection of clinical records in hospitals. We first performed rigorous de-identification process, removing all sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII), such as patient IDs and physical examination details under HIPAA. We also filtered out irrelevant images, such as post-operative photos and non-diagnostic tables. Subsequently, Expert LLM model was utilized to conduct fine-grained classification of the data, ensuring the datasets purity by excluding non-orthopedic cases. As shown in Figure 2, the orthopedic domain was categorized into 7 classes, with the spine sub-domain further divided into 14 distinct classes. detailed statistical overview of the dataset distribution across these categories is presented in Figure 4. Dataset Generation In close collaboration with medical experts, we designed comprehensive annotation schema to generate high-quality, multi-task training data. The annotation process was tailored to the data source: (1) From External Knowledge Sources (e.g., Textbooks): We generated bilingual (Chinese and English) and multimodal (text and image-based) questions in both multiplechoice and open-ended formats using Expert VLM Model with carefully designed prompts. (2) From Opened-spine Datasets: We processed two open-source spinal datasets, Spark and Verse, to generate multi-turn question-and-answer dialogues that simulate doctor-patient interactions. These datasets consist mainly of unimodal 3D image slices (CT and MRI). To ensure consistency, we standardized the inputs by adaptively sampling 25 slices per case under clinical expert supervision. From this, we created over 300 simulated consultations to train models in their conversational abilities within spinal scenarios. (3) From Real Clinical Records: We created multiple-choice questions, multi-turn conversational datasets for patient interviews, and comprehensive spinal diagnostic reports via Expert VLM Model. For prompt design, please refer to the Appendix B. Annotation of the spinal diagnostic report cornerstone of our dataset is the generation of detailed spinal diagnostic reports. In this process, we utilized real clinical reports from hospitals, incorporating physician recommendations, to design reports that encompass six dimensions, all aimed at simulating complete clinical workflow: (1) Structured Imaging Findings: Analyze the provided medical images and distill key radiological evidence that supports the final diagnosis. (2) AI-Assisted Diagnosis: Formulate diagnostic conclusion and articulate the reasoning process based on the synthesis of clinical data and imaging analysis.

The training process is divided into three stages, each integrating distinct datasets and training strategies to progressively strengthen the models performance in spinal health. General and Orthopedic Foundational Learning In this initial stage, we utilized several publicly available medical text datasets, including medical-o1-reasoning-SFT (Chen et al., 2024a), MedicalR1-Distill-Data (Chen et al., 2024a), and MedThoughts-8K (hw hwei, 2025). Additionally, we incorporated diverse set of 150,000 multimodal instruction fine-tuning samples uniformly sampled from PubMedVision (Chen et al., 2024b). The primary objective during this phase is to develop the models foundational capabilities in the medical field and to enhance its performance across various contexts. Subsequently, we trained on data from the SpineMed-450k dataset that pertained to non-spinal categories. Our findings indicate that this non-spinal data significantly improved the models performance on the SpineBench benchmark, highlighting the importance of broadening the knowledge base to enhance task-specific performance. 7 Specialized Learning in Spinal Health In this phase, we concentrated on all data pertinent to spinal health. Furthermore, we extracted selection of multiple-choice and open-ended questions to construct long reasoning chains, with the objective of enhancing the models proficiency in the domain of spinal surgery. Enhancement of Report Generation and Conversational Abilities Finally, we conducted further training through multi-turn dialogues, report generation, and datasets comprising long-chain reasoning instructions. The goal of this stage is to develop the models advanced language comprehension and generation abilities, particularly in the contexts of dialogue interaction and report creation.

The evaluation results in Table 4 reveal severe limitations of current vision-language models (OpenAI, 2025a; Hurst et al., 2024; Google, 2025a) in medical domain applications. Large-scale open-source models perform particularly poorly: despite having 72B parameters, Qwen2.5-VL-72B (Bai et al., 2025) achieves only 79.88% average performance and mere 63.80 cumulative score on medical report generation, far below practical application requirements. Even the best-performing opensource model GLM-4.5V (Hong et al., 2025) (83.26%) exhibits nearly 6-point gap compared to the leading proprietary model Gemini-2.5-Pro (89.23%). This gap is more pronounced in medical report generation, where proprietary models exceed 85 points while open-source models struggle to reach 80. Additional medical report results are in the Appendix B.3. Pervasive deficiency in cross-modal alignment. Nearly all models exhibit varying degrees of performance degradation on multimodal tasks. Among open-source models, GLM-4.5V shows 4.36-point gap between text (85.71%) and image (81.35%) modalities; Qwen2.5-VL-72B exhibits 4.90-point gap. Even proprietary models suffer from this issue, with GPT5 dropping from 87.41% on text to 79.97% on images, gap of 7.44 percentage points. This cross-modal performance disparity reflects fundamental inadequacies in medical image understanding and vision-language alignment in existing models, limiting their application in clinical scenarios requiring comprehensive analysis of medical images and textual information. Our method achieves breakthrough performance among open-source models. We achieve 87.44% average score, outperforming all open-source models by 4.18+ points and exceeding multiple proprietary models on close-ended QA (87.89% vs Claude4s 79.67%, GPT-4os 84.74%). Our text-only QA (89.46%) surpasses all models including GPT5 (87.41%). 8 Figure 5: Consistency evaluation of large models and scores given by medical experts"

            "content": "B.1 RELATED WORK The landscape of medical AI is rapidly evolving, moving from broad, general-purpose models to highly specialized systems designed for clinical utility. Our work is situated within this trend, addressing critical gap in the high-stakes field of spine surgery. From Generalist Models to Domain Adaptation. Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023) and Gemini2.5-pro (Google, 2025a), have demonstrated significant progress in multimodal tasks (Yang et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023). However, when applied to the medical domain, their generalist nature becomes distinct limitation. Multiple evaluations consistently show that while promising, these models lack the domain-specific expertise required for complex diagnostic tasks, performing below the level of human specialists (AlSaad et al., 2024). This inherent limitation of generalist models has fueled clear and necessary trend toward specialization. In response, specialized medical LVLMs like LLaVA-Med (Li et al., 2023) and PMC-LLaMA (Wu et al., 2024) have been developed, fine-tuned on large biomedical corpora. Nevertheless, this approach still has shortcomings. For instance, in spinal diagnostics, critical task is the synthesis of data from multimodal imagingsuch as X-ray, CT, and MRIto formulate single, \"level-aware\" diagnosis. This integrative reasoning process, which requires localizing findings to specific vertebral levels, is clinical skill that cannot be acquired from static, descriptive datasets alone. This further underscores core principle: for high-stakes clinical applications, deep, narrow expertise is far more valuable than broad, superficial general knowledge. powerful example validating this principle is OralGPT (Hao et al., 2025), model trained on small, highly curated dataset of intraoral photographs, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art generalist models within its niche. This paradigm shift from generalist to specialist models is now clearly evident across numerous medical fields, from oncology to pathology (Qiu et al., 2023; Sarabadani et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; 2024; Barrit et al., 2024; Mo et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2024; Xue et al., 2024; Bhaumik et al., 2023; Na, 2024; Guo et al., 2025). Foundational Datasets and the Cognitive Gap. Progress in AI is fundamentally tied to the quality of training data. Foundational datasets like MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019) and CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019) have been instrumental for tasks like chest radiograph classification. Moving up in complexity are datasets for interactive Visual Question Answering (VQA). For instance, VQA-RAD (Lau et al., 2018) was manually constructed by clinicians asking naturally occurring questions about radiology images, representing step toward more dynamic reasoning. More recently, large-scale efforts like MedTrinity-25M (Xie et al., 2024b) have emerged, providing over 25 million images with multi-granular annotations to support wide range of tasks. Within the spine domain itself, public datasets have primarily supported foundational computer vision tasks. The VerSe dataset (Sekuboyina et al., 2021), for example, is critical resource providing CT scans with precise voxel-level annotations for vertebral segmentation and identification. Other datasets (Lee et al., 2024a; Ibrahim et al., 2025a) have followed similar focus, providing valuable benchmarks for segmentation of the lumbar spine from MRI. However, these resources are designed to support lower-level cognitive tasks like perception (\"Where is the L4 vertebra?\") or classification (\"Is 15 fracture present?\"). They do not provide the necessary data to train models for the highest level of clinical cognition: synthesizing multimodal information into comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan. This reveals crucial gap between existing data and the needs of clinical practice, gap our work aims to fill. AI in Spine Analysis: From Tools to Collaborators. Prior AI applications in spine analysis have focused on discrete tasks, creating valuable \"tools\" rather than \"collaborators.\" These include automated vertebral segmentation and the measurement of spinal parameters (Lee et al., 2024a; Ibrahim et al., 2025a). While useful for improving efficiency, these tools perform isolated tasks, leaving the cognitive burden of synthesis and planning to the human clinician (Nath et al., 2025b). Our work directly addresses these gaps. By creating SpineMed-450k, large-scale dataset derived from clinical workflows, and SpineBench, benchmark focused on level-aware, multimodal reasoning, we provide the infrastructure to build and evaluate AI systems that can function as true clinical collaborators in the complex domain of spine surgery.

Your core task is to rigorously compare the [LLM Generated Answer] provided below with the [Standard Answer]. Based on comprehensive and detailed scoring rubric, you will systematically evaluate the [LLM Generated Answer]s performance against the [Standard Answer] across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, completeness, logical coherence, readability, and clinical utility. Finally, you will output your evaluation in the specified simple format. II. Inputs for Evaluation 1. [Standard Answer] (Golden Answer) [Please paste the ideal, golden standard answer here] 2. [LLM Generated Answer] [Please paste the AI-generated answer that requires evaluation here] III. Evaluation Instructions & Scoring Rubric Please score the [LLM Generated Answer] for each dimension below, strictly based on its comparison with the [Standard Answer]. Please note: Scores MUST be continuous values (e.g., 3.5, 4.2, 4.7) to more precisely reflect the subtle differences in the evaluation results between the integer standards. The integer scores (1-5 points) in the rubric should serve as the primary anchors for your scoring, but you should use decimal precision to capture nuanced differences. For example: - If performance is slightly above \"Good\" (4 pts) but not quite \"Excellent\" (5 pts), use scores like 4.3 or 4.6. - If performance has minor gaps compared to standard, use scores like 3.8 or 4.2. - Avoid whole numbers unless the performance exactly matches the integer anchor description. 1. Structured Imaging Report 5 pts (Excellent / On Par): On par with the [Standard Answer], accurately describes all key imaging findings, correctly explains their clinical significance, and includes quantitative descriptions. 4 pts (Good / Minor Gaps): The description of major findings is correct, but it lacks some of the quantitative details present in the [Standard Answer]. 3 pts (Fair / Clear Gaps): The description is generally correct, but the explanation of clinical significance is clearly less sufficient or in-depth than the [Standard Answer]. 2 pts (Poor / Serious Deficiencies): Omits or incorrectly describes key findings that are mentioned in the [Standard Answer]. 1 pt (Unacceptable / Completely Wrong): Seriously misinterprets the imaging, with key conclusions that contradict the [Standard Answer]. 2. AI-Assisted Diagnosis 5 pts (Excellent / On Par): On par with the [Standard Answer], the primary diagnosis is completely correct, secondary diagnoses are reasonably listed, and key differential diagnoses are correctly ruled out. 4 pts (Good / Minor Gaps): The primary diagnosis is correct, but the list of secondary diagnoses is less complete than in the [Standard Answer]. 3 pts (Fair / Clear Gaps): The primary diagnosis is correct but omits important differential diagnoses that are mentioned in the [Standard Answer]. 2 pts (Poor / Serious Deficiencies): The primary diagnosis is partially incorrect or omits key components present in the [Standard Answer]. 1 pt (Unacceptable / Completely Wrong): The diagnosis is completely wrong or misses life-threatening condition. 3. Treatment Recommendations 3.1 Patient-Oriented Advice 5 pts (Excellent / On Par): On par with the [Standard Answer], the language is extremely colloquial and easy to understand, the information is completely accurate, the structure is clear, and it is highly effective at reassuring the patient.
