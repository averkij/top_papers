            "content": "LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across wide range of natural language tasks, marking milestone in AI. Yet their inherent unreliability, which manifests through factual errors, biases, and hallucinations, remains critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains such as medicine, law, and finance (Bommasani et al., 2022; Farquhar et al., 2024). To address this issue, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has emerged as key technology for enhancing trustworthiness. Traditionally, UQ has focused on the post-hoc evaluation and calibration of outputs (Zhang, 2021; Xiong et al., 2024). Methods based on Bayesian inference, ensembles, or information-theoretic metrics aim to provide confidence scores for single1 turn generations, effectively measuring how much the model knows about its own response (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). While foundational, this function treats uncertainty as passive, diagnostic metric attached to completed outputs. Yet such an approach is insufficient for the next generation of LLM systems, which involve multi-step reasoning, interactive environments, and alignment with complex human values (Kirchhof et al., 2025). The importance of this field has spurred series of excellent surveys. Some organize the landscape around uncertainty estimation, including tokenlevel analysis, consistency checks, semantic clustering, and entropy (Xia et al., 2025b; Shorinwa et al., 2025; Kuhn et al., 2023). Others adopt theory-grounded perspectives, linking heuristics to Bayesian and information-theoretic principles (Huang et al., 2024). Broader work has examined confidence calibration (Geng et al., 2024), while recent efforts have begun to rethink the definition and sources of uncertainty in the LLM lifecycle, categorizing them along new dimensions such as computational cost or reasoning uncertainty (Beigi et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025c; Li et al., 2025b). While aforementioned resources provide valuable overviews of how uncertainty can be measured, this paper complements that body of work by surveying an emerging technological trend: the evolution of uncertainty from passive metric to an active, real-time control signal. This enables systems that can know what they dont know (Kadavath et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2023) and take action based on this self-awareness (Betley et al., 2025). Our key contribution is to categorize and analyze research where uncertainty functions as control mechanism. While prior work focused on how to measure uncertainty, we focus on how to use it, organizing the discussion around three domains where this functional evolution is most evident: Advanced Reasoning: How uncertainty guides dynamic reasoning strategies, optimizes computational effort, and triggers self-correction. Autonomous Agents: How uncertainty drives decisions on tool use, information seeking, and risk management in interactive settings. RL and Reward Models: How modeling uncertainty in human preferences and rewards enables more robust alignment and mitigates failure modes like reward hacking. By tracing uncertaintys evolving role from passive evaluation to active control, we provide comprehensive overview of this emerging frontier and outline the fundamental challenges and future research directions."

            "title": "2 The Limits of Traditional UQ",
            "content": "The classical paradigm of UQ provides foundational, but ultimately limited, framework for assessing the reliability of LLMs. Traditionally, UQ distinguishes between aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, and epistemic uncertainty, stemming from the models lack of knowledge and reducible with more data (Kendall and Gal, 2017). The principal objective has been post-hoc evaluation, where confidence score is assigned after model generates an output (Xia et al., 2025b; Shorinwa et al., 2025; Tian et al., 2023). While useful for simple generation tasks, this generate-then-evaluate function treats uncertainty as passive, diagnostic metric. Its inability to provide real-time, actionable feedback becomes especially limiting in the complex, dynamic, and interactive settings that characterize frontier LLM applications (Kirchhof et al., 2025). There are several shortcomings of this strategy: Inapplicability to Multi-Step Reasoning: In chain-of-thought reasoning, early mistakes can derail entire sequences. final post-hoc score is insufficient; models require continuous uncertainty signals at intermediate steps to backtrack, branch, or adapt in real time. Insufficiency for Autonomous Agents: For LLM agents, uncertainty informs various decisions, such as whether to rely on parametric knowledge, invoke tools, or seek human input. single retrospective score on text output does not support such proactive choices. Mismatch with Dynamic and Interactive Systems: Classical UQ assumes static, monolithic outputs. However, modern LLM systems involve branching reasoning paths, environmental interactions, and iterative alignment loops, requiring uncertainty to evolve dynamically alongside system behavior. We believe these limitations call for functional shift. To build robust and reliable systems, uncertainty must move beyond passive assessment and become an active control signal integrated into the models operational loop. The Evolving Role of Uncertainty Quantification: From Passive Metric to Active Signal Passive Metric (Post-hoc Diagnosis) When: Assigns score after generation is complete. Role: Acts as diagnostic tool (output reliable?). Nature: Static and external to the generation process. Active Signal (Real-time Control) When: Intervenes during generation via feedback. Role: Acts as control mechanism (trigger actions?). Nature: Dynamic and integrated into the models operational loop."

            "content": "In advanced reasoning with LLMs, uncertainty has shifted from passive, post-hoc quality score to an active internal signal that guides decision-making: from arbitrating between reasoning paths, to steering trajectories within individual reasoning path, and allocating cognitive effort efficiently. Table 1 provides comparative analysis of these frameworks, detailing for each method the specific uncertainty signal it uses (the what) and the control mechanism through which it acts (the how). 3.1 Between Reasoning Paths: Weighted Selection. Inference-time scaling, where models generate many reasoning traces and then aggregate them, has become standard strategy for improving robustness (Pan et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b). Uncertainty enables nuanced selection between generated reasoning paths to improve overall accuracy. Confidence-Weighted Selection. Recent work moves beyond the one path, one vote function by leveraging uncertainty as weighting signal (Yin et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2025b). Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC) (Taubenfeld et al., 2025) assigns each reasoning path holistic confidence score based on its length-normalized probability, Between Reasoning Paths (3.1) Advanced Reasoning (3) Inside Reasoning Path (3.2) Optimizing Cognitive Effort (3.3) Responding to Uncertainty (4.1) Confidence-Weighted Selection Utility vs Fidelity Inference-time Guidance Training-time Improvements Critical Points or States Momentum Uncertainty Classify to Select Action Policy Learned via RL Post-hoc Calibration g - t - - - i e Autonomous Agents (4) Tool-Use Decision Boundary (4.2) Policy Learned via Fine-tune Uncertainty Propagation (4.3) Forward Propagation Threshold-based Trigger Robust Reward Models (5.1) RL & Reward Modeling (5) Self-improvement RL (5.2) Bayesian RMS Uncertainty-aware RMs Entropy Minimization Confidence as Intrinsic Reward Scalable Process Supervision (5.3) Uncertainty Segmentation Theoretical Frameworks (6) Challenges & Future Direction (7) Bayesian Method (6.1) Conformal Prediction (6.2) Figure 1: The taxonomy of this survey, illustrating the evolving role of uncertainty to an active control signal across advanced LLM applications, emerging theories and open challenges. which then weights the final vote. Confidence Enhanced Reasoning (CER) (Razghandi et al., 2025) instead evaluates confidence at crucial intermediate steps, aggregating them into more robust score. Other approaches apply Bayesian inference to select promising paths (Yan et al., 2025b), or trained reward models to compute confidence scores (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c). Utility vs. Fidelity Trade-off. Weighted methods expose tension between the utility of confidence scores for local decisions and their fidelity for global calibration. As Taubenfeld et al. (2025) show, methods with strong global calibration (confidence aligning with average accuracy) often struggle to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning paths on single question. The key factor is Within-Question Discrimination (WQD), the ability of confidence to separate right from wrong answers given one problem. sharp, locally discriminative signal, even if globally overconfident, is more useful for path selection. CER embodies this principle by emphasizing confidence at critical reasoning steps, favoring local discrimination over global fidelity (Razghandi et al., 2025). These approaches illustrate fundamental tradeoff. CERs fine-grained step evaluation improves robustness in long-chain reasoning, but increases implementation complexity.

Both rely on calibrated confidence estimates; when miscalibrated, the weighting mechanism may amplify errors instead of correcting them. More details in Appendix Table 4. 3.2 Inside Reasoning Path: Beyond Inference to Training Within reasoning path, uncertainty is not merely retrospective confidence measure but an active control signal, guiding reasoning during inference and serving as training objective (Da et al., 2025). Inference-Time Guidance. Uncertainty provides real-time feedback that allows models to adapt their reasoning as it unfolds (Wang et al., 2025e; Hu et al., 2024). Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Guidance (UAG) (Kamoi et al., 2024) monitors step-level uncertainty and retracts to lowuncertainty checkpoints when reasoning drifts. Spontaneous Self-Correction (SPOC) (Zhao et al., 2025b) assigns the model dual roles of proposer and verifier, using uncertainty to action selection: continuation, backtracking, or revision. AdaptiveStep (Liu et al., 2025d) aligns reasoning with natural uncertainty-guided boundaries rather than rule-based segmentation, improving supervision and interpretability. In this view, uncertainty shapes both the unfolding of reasoning and the structural units within it (Yin et al., 2024). Training-Time Improvements. Uncertainty also drives advances in model training (Zhong et al., 2025). Uncertainty-Sensitive Tuning (Li et al., 2025a) teaches models to abstain under high uncertainty, then restores general capabilities while retaining calibrated restraint. Uncertainty-Aware Fine-Tuning modifies the loss function itself (Krishnan et al., 2024), rewarding higher uncertainty on ultimately incorrect predictions to produce more reliable estimates. Other approaches apply Uncertainty-guided data filter to emphasize plausible examples (Gan et al., 2025). These methods elevate uncertainty from secondary signal to primary learning objective in training. In summary, inference-time methods offer immediate correction without retraining, but remain limited by the models intrinsic self-correction ability. Training-time approaches incur higher cost upfront but yield models with fundamentally stronger uncertainty awareness across downstream tasks. 3.3 Optimizing Cognitive Effort: Uncertainty as an Economic Signal The challenge in reasoning tasks is enabling models to think on demand, performing additional reasoning only when necessary rather than overthinking simple tasks. Uncertainty provides low-cost control for balancing efficiency and accuracy. Critical Points or States. UnCert-CoT (Li et al., 2025b) applies this principle to structured reasoning tasks like code generation. At critical decision points (e.g., the first non-indentation token of new line), the model measures uncertainty using entropy or probability margins. If uncertainty exceeds threshold, it activates CoT decoding; otherwise, it proceeds with direct code generation.

Similarly, ThoughtTerminator (Pu et al., 2025) and other related approaches (Xia et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025b; Fu et al., 2025b) assess whether the current state is sufficient to answer question to decide whether to continue reasoning. Momentum Uncertainty. Momentum Uncertainty Reasoning (MUR) (Yan et al., 2025a) adopts trajectory-level perspective. Rather than relying on single thresholds, MUR aggregates uncertainty across steps and allocates flexible thinking budget to regions of the reasoning path. This reduces computation by over 50% while improving accuracy through targeted resource allocation. Threshold-based methods like UnCert-CoT are simple but sensitive to hyperparameters, risking underor over-thinking. Momentum-based approaches like MUR offer more control but add complexity. Together, these methods highlight uncertainty as an economic signal: effective reasoning depends not only on what model knows, but also on recognizing when to think harder."

            "title": "4 Autonomous Agents",
            "content": "In LLM agents, uncertainty has evolved from passive textual property to an active metacognitive signal that drives agentic behavior: from strategically responding to internal states, to governing the tool-use decision boundary, and managing uncertainty propagation in multi-step workflows. 4.1 From Abstention to Inquiry: Responding to Internal Uncertainty For an LLM to evolve from static generator into an autonomous agent, it must develop metacognition, that is the ability to know what it does not know. An agents strategic response to its own uncertainty is key marker of intelligence, with recent research tracing an evolutionary trajectory from defensive behaviors to proactive inquiry. The basic strategy is passive defense, where the agent abstains when uncertainty is high, especially for high-stakes domains (Stoisser et al., 2025). More advanced is diagnostic response, where the agent probes the source of its confusion, whether knowledge gaps, capability limits, or query ambiguity (Liu et al., 2025a). The most sophisticated strategy is proactive inquiry, where the agent learns an optimal policy for asking clarifying questions to strategically reduce future uncertainty (Hu et al., 2024). Table 2 compares distinct uncertainty signals and control mechanisms in such strategies. This evolution highlights trade-off between autonomy and utility. Abstention ensures safety but can reduce helpfulness; proactive inquiry reflects higher intelligence but increases implementation complexity, see discussions in Table 5. 4.2 Tool-Use Decision Boundary key capability of modern LLM agents is leveraging external tools (e.g., search engines and APIs) to overcome the limits of parametric knowledge. This introduces core dilemma: when should an agent rely on internal knowledge versus incurring the cost of tool use? Naive strategies that default to external calls risk inefficiency and Tool Overuse (Qian et al., 2025b; Yao et al., 2022). Recent work addresses this by using uncertainty as control signal to set more intelligent decision boundary. The evolution of these strategies reveals trajectory from reactive control to calibrated autonomy. The earliest methods use inference-time control, where the model generates preliminary answer and invokes tools only when real-time uncertainty is high, improving efficiency (Han et al., 2024). More advanced approaches pursue training-time self-awareness, fine-tuning agents on specialized datasets to internalize knowledge boundaries and develop calibrated intrinsic policies for tool use (Qian et al., 2025b). Another line of work focuses 5 on uncertainty calibration, showing that by calibrating the control signal, agents achieve more reliable tool-use decisions (Liu et al., 2024). The shift from inference-time control to trainingtime self-awareness reflects trade-off between ease and robustness. Threshold-based inferencetime methods are simple but brittle, while trainingbased policies are expensive yet yield stronger domain adaptation. shared limitation remains: most approaches decide whether to call tool, but not how to handle uncertainty or error in the tools own outputs, leaving key challenge for future work, see more comparative analysis in Table 2. 4.3 Uncertainty Propagation in Multi-step Workflows In complex multi-step tasks, uncertainty is dynamic: small errors can accumulate and propagate through workflow, ultimately leading to task failure. Traditional uncertainty methods typically assess single-turn outputs and overlook this compounding effect (Cemri et al., 2025). Building reliable long-horizon agents requires explicitly modeling how uncertainty evolves across the thoughtactionobservation cycle. Recent frameworks address this by tracking and propagating uncertainty throughout decisionmaking. The situation-awareness uncertainty propagation (SAUP) framework (Zhao et al., 2024) is to track uncertainty at each step and weight its importance based on the context. Recognizing that not all uncertainties are equally critical, SAUP introduces situational weights that amplify the uncertainty score of steps deemed more pivotal. In contrast, the UProp framework (Duan et al., 2025) provides an information-theoretic foundation, decomposing total uncertainty into Intrinsic Uncertainty (IU) at the current step and Extrinsic Uncertainty (EU) inherited from previous steps. These approaches highlight critical shift in the source of uncertainty. In reasoning-only tasks, uncertainty is largely cognitive and internal, whereas in agentic systems, the environment itself becomes dominant driver. The different mechanisms for modeling uncertainty propagation, as detailed in Table 2 and 5, represent different approaches to capturing the risks that arise from an agents interaction with dynamic and unpredictable world. 4.4 Multi-Agent Systems As research advances from single agents to multiagent systems (MAS), uncertainty challenges are not simply scaled but fundamentally transformed. Uncertainty now arises both within each agents internal reasoning and in the communication and interactions between agents (Hu et al., 2025; Barbi et al., 2025; Hazra et al., 2025). key concern is that uncertainty can propagate and amplify across interactions. An agent may receive uncertain or incorrect information from peer, yet treat it as factual, causing cascades of errors that destabilize the collective (Hu et al., 2025). Analyses of MAS failures highlight inter-agent misalignment as primary cause, often stemming not from individual errors but from flawed interactions, e.g., failing to seek clarification when faced with ambiguity. The central challenge is achieving inter-agent agreement under uncertainty. This requires extending single-agent metacognitive skills to the collective, enabling agents to model the uncertainty of their peers and adopt policies for uncertaintyaware communication. Robust UQ frameworks must therefore operate at two levels simultaneously: ensuring reliable local decisions for each agent while managing the propagation and aggregation of uncertainty across the system as whole."

            "title": "5 RL and Reward Modeling",
            "content": "In RL alignment, uncertainty has transformed from factor ignored by deterministic scores into core mechanism for robust learning: from building robust reward models to mitigate reward hacking, to enabling self-improvement via intrinsic rewards, and automating scalable process supervision. 5.1 Robust Reward Models The cornerstone of the RLHF pipeline is the Reward Model (RM), which serves as proxy for human values (Lambert et al., 2025). Conventional RMs are deterministic, producing single scalar score. This creates mismatch with the stochastic nature of human preferences and enables reward hacking (Fu et al., 2025a; Weng, 2024), where policies exploit RM inaccuracies to score highly on low-quality outputs (Lou et al., 2024; Cief et al., 2024). To address this, recent work has focused on RMs that can model and express uncertainty, broadly divided into two approaches. Uncertainty-Aware Reward Models (URMs). This class of methods makes the RM explicitly aware of uncertainty, typically through architectural or feature-based modifications. foundational approach is to redesign the RMs output to 6 Core Concept Strategy Function Uncertainty Signal (The What) Control Mechanism (The How) Reward Models URM (Lou et al., 2024) UALIGN (Xue et al., 2025) Reward distribution variance Penalty term in RL objective Policy LLMs semantic entropy Features for RM to learn Bayesian RMs (Yang et al., 2024) Posterior distribution over RM weights Theoretically-grounded penalty RLSF (van Niekerk et al., 2025) Models confidence scores Auto-generation of preference pairs Self-Improvement Confidence Maximization (Prabhudesai et al., 2025) Models confidence score intrinsic reward signal in RL.

It details how different frameworks leverage uncertainty signals to create more robust reward models, enable self-improvement, and scale supervision. be probabilistic. The URM framework modifies the models output head to predict full probability distribution (e.g., Gaussian) instead of single score (Lou et al., 2024). The variance of this distribution then serves as direct, quantifiable signal of the aleatoric uncertainty (the intrinsic ambiguity in human data). complementary strategy is to enrich the RMs input. The UALIGN framework achieves this by feeding the policy LLMs own uncertainty metrics (e.g., semantic entropy) as explicit features to the RM (Xue et al., 2025). This allows the RM to learn context-aware evaluation function that is conditioned on the difficulty of the query as perceived by the policy model itself. Bayesian Reward Models (Bayesian RMs). Instead of learning single point estimate for the weights, Bayesian RMs learn posterior distribution over them, thereby capturing epistemic uncertainty (the RMs own model uncertainty) (Yang et al., 2024). This is implemented using techniques like Laplace-LoRA (Schulman and Lab, 2025). The key advantage of this approach is that the uncertainty derived from the posterior can be used as direct, theoretically-grounded penalty term during RL optimization. This actively discourages the policy from exploring and exploiting regions of the output space where the RM is unconfident, leading to safer and more robust alignment. detailed comparative analysis is available in Table 3. 5.2 Self-Improvement RL While robust reward models strengthen external supervision, more advanced paradigm seeks to reduce dependence on such signals altogether. This paradigm is grounded in intrinsic motivation, where an agent improves by optimizing its own internal states rather than external feedback. Uncertainty expressed as confidence, entropy, or information gain (IG), has emerged as the core intrinsic reward for enabling self-driven alignment in LLMs. Confidence as an Intrinsic Reward. The simplest intrinsic signal is self-confidence. The Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF) framework demonstrates that confidence scores can generate synthetic preference pairs (e.g., high-confidencelow-confidence), enabling selfalignment without human labels (van Niekerk et al., 2025). Further studies show that directly maximizing confidence via RL significantly improves reasoning, confirming confidence as standalone intrinsic reward (Prabhudesai et al., 2025). Yet, miscalibrated confidence can reinforce errors, and overconfidence may cause reward hacking. Entropy Minimization (EM). deeper perspective frames reasoning as drive to reduce uncertainty. The principle of EM treats reasoning as minimizing the entropy of the predictive distribution, offering reward-free, unsupervised objective for improving LLM reasoning (Agarwal et al., 2025). However, this approach is being actively refined, with the latest research exploring entropy not just as quantity to be minimized, but as regularization signal to achieve better balance between confidence and accuracy (Jiang et al., 2025). RL for EM. This information-theoretic signal can be optimized with RL, where entropy reduction itself becomes the reward. Frameworks such as EMPO incentivize reasoning trajectories that minimize future uncertainty (Zhang et al., 2025b; Cui et al., 2025). Architectures like Intuitor extend this to fully reward-free agents that learn policies from intrinsic motivations such as curiosity and uncertainty reduction (Zhao et al., 2025a). Dissecting the Process with Mutual Information. Recent work leverages Mutual Information (MI) to analyze how EM operates. Crucially, the most informative thinking tokens in chain of thought are those corresponding to peaks in MI with the final answer (Qian et al., 2025a). This provides 7 mechanistic explanation of entropy minimization: reasoning progresses by identifying and resolving uncertainty at precisely these pivotal points. 5.3 Scalable Process Supervision While intrinsic rewards enhance autonomy, alignment quality can be improved with fine-grained external feedback. Process-based supervision (Lightman et al., 2023), which rewards correct intermediate steps rather than only final outcomes, provides stronger learning signal. However, its adoption has been limited by the high cost of manually segmenting reasoning chains into logical steps and annotating each one (Chen et al., 2024). Uncertainty as Automation Tools. Recent work leverages uncertainty to automate this segmentation. The EDU-PRM framework (Cao et al., 2025) identifies tokens with high predictive entropy between reasoning steps, and uses them as uncertainty anchors to partition chains automatically. This enables scalable generation of process-level training data at fraction of manual cost. Empirical results further suggest that RL gains are primarily driven by learning to handle these high-entropy minority tokens (Wang et al., 2025c). By transforming uncertainty into an automation tool, these methods make process-level supervision economically viable. The key limitation is heuristic reliability: high entropy is strong but imperfect signal of logical boundaries. As result, automated partitions may not always align with human-defined reasoning steps, creating trade-off between scalability and annotation precision (Sun et al., 2024)."

            "title": "6 Emerging Theoretical Frameworks",
            "content": "The evolution from uncertainty as passive metric to an active control signal is not merely collection of empirical techniques; it reflects deeper need for principled foundations to build reliable and trustworthy systems. 6.1 The Bayesian Method As foundational theory for reasoning under uncertainty, Bayesian methods are experiencing resurgence, offering principled basis for analyzing and guiding LLM behavior. key theoretical insight is that while LLMs are not strictly Bayesian reasoners, their in-context learning mechanism often approximates Bayesian predictive updating in expectation (Chlon et al., 2025). This justifies applying Bayesian frameworks not to model the LLM internally, but to analyze its aggregate behavior and build more robust systems around it. One pragmatic direction is hybrid systems that combine LLMs with formal probabilistic models. These exploit complementary strengths: qualitative, abductive reasoning from LLMs and quantitative uncertainty management from Bayesian inference. For example, BIRD uses LLMs to generate causal sketches that are formalized into Bayesian Networks for precise reasoning (Feng et al., 2025). Textual Bayes integrates more deeply, treating prompts as textual parameters for Bayesian inference (Ross et al., 2025), while other works use LLMs for prior elicitation (Selby et al., 2024). Another ambitious line seeks to teach LLMs probabilistic reasoning directly, mitigating cognitive biases such as base-rate neglect (Smith et al., 2024). Bayesian Teaching fine-tunes models to mimic an ideal Bayesian observer, with evidence of generalization to unseen tasks (Qiu et al., 2025). This shift from using LLMs as Bayesian components to embedding Bayesian reasoning within them marks step toward fundamentally improving their cognitive machinery (Yan et al., 2025b). 6.2 Conformal Prediction In contrast to Bayesian methods that rely on prior distributions, Conformal Prediction (CP) offers powerful non-Bayesian framework with rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees (Su et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). For any input, CP constructs prediction set guaranteed to contain the true output with user-specified probability, independent of model architecture or data distribution. Yet defining prediction sets and non-conformity scores for free-form text is non-trivial to apply CP to LLMs. Recent work addresses this by adapting CP to different levels of model access. Black-Box (API-Only) Approaches. Without access to logits, methods like ConU (Wang et al., 2024) and Su et al. (2024) employ semantic similarity as proxy for non-conformity.The prediction set includes generated candidate along with semantically similar alternatives under calibrated threshold. This reframes CPs guarantee from exact string matching to semantic equivalence, making it practical for open-ended generation. White-Box (Logit-Access) Approaches. With full access to model probabilities, token-level calibration is possible. Conformal Language Modeling (Quach et al., 2023) uses logits to build predic8 tion sets for the next token at each step, ensuring that the true token lies within the set with high probability. This provides stronger guarantees but requires model transparency (Cherian et al., 2024). The TheoryPractice Gap. Despite growing advances in theoretical frameworks, practitioners still face multiple open questions. To bridge this gap, we provide set of design patterns and practical recommendations in Appendix Section C."

            "title": "7 Challenges and Future Directions",
            "content": "While the evolving role of uncertainty is rapidly advancing, its full realization hinges on addressing several fundamental challenges. Reliability and Robustness of the Active Signal. The function of uncertainty-as-a-control-signal is built upon the assumption that the signal itself is meaningful and trustworthy. Future work must rigorously address the integrity of this foundational layer. Even non-adversarial estimation errors can be amplified by downstream control mechanisms (Wilczynski et al., 2024). For example, poorly calibrated confidence score can cause weighted voting to favor incorrect answers, while miscalibrated thresholds may lead agents to become recklessly overconfident or inefficiently tool-dependent. Advancing UQ Benchmarking. The maturity of the field is evidenced by emerging standardized benchmarks, such as UBench (Wang et al., 2025d) and LM-Polygraph (Vashurin et al., 2025). While foundational, these frameworks predominantly assess estimation fidelity, diagnosing if model knows it is wrong rather than control utility. They generally fail to simulate the dynamic decision-making trade-offs inherent to the active paradigm. Consequently, critical misalignment exists between static evaluation protocols and dynamic control needs (Ye et al., 2024). Future benchmarks must evolve to quantify the downstream performance gains directly attributable to uncertaintyin-the-loop mechanisms. Meaningful Evaluation and Metrics. Current evaluation remains significant bottleneck. Standard metrics like AUROC are ill-suited for the rich, interactive, and dynamic contexts where the activesignal function is most relevant (Liu et al., 2025c). The field urgently requires new benchmarks and evaluation protocols specifically designed for interactive agents and complex reasoning tasks. Crucially, future evaluation must become more humancentered. The ultimate measure of success for an uncertainty-aware system is not just its statistical calibration, but its effectiveness as partner in human-AI collaboration (Devic et al., 2025). Composable, Uncertainty-Propagating Systems. Extending uncertainty management from single, monolithic models to complex, interconnected systems remains major open problem. In MAS, the challenge is to understand how uncertainty propagates, compounds, and resolves across interacting agents, which requires new frameworks that operate at the system level rather than the individual agent level (Hu et al., 2025). More broadly, the ultimate trajectory points towards modular AI systems composed of heterogeneous components. central challenge will be to establish unified framework where uncertainty signals function as the connective tissue between these modules. Scalability and Efficiency. persistent challenge in this field is the trade-off between theoretical rigor and computational feasibility. Many of the most principled and powerful methods, particularly those grounded in Bayesian inference or requiring large-scale multi-agent simulations, are often too computationally expensive for widespread, realtime deployment. critical direction for future work is therefore the development of scalable and efficient approximations of these formal methods."

            "title": "8 Conclusion",
            "content": "This survey has charted an emerging technological trend: the evolution of uncertainty in LLMs from passive, post-hoc diagnostic metric into an active, real-time control signal. We have traced this transformation across three frontiers: advanced reasoning, autonomous agents, and reinforcement learning, demonstrating how uncertainty is now being used not just to evaluate outputs, but to dynamically shape model behavior."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "While this survey provides comprehensive overview of the uncertainty-as-a-control-signal trend, we acknowledge several limitations inherent in its scope and focus. First, our narrative is intentionally focused on the functional role of uncertainty in advanced LLM systems (reasoning, agents, and alignment). Consequently, we do not 9 provide an exhaustive, in-depth review of all specific uncertainty estimation techniques or the extensive literature on confidence calibration. We have pointed readers to other excellent surveys dedicated to these important topics in our introduction. Second, the field of uncertainty in LLMs is evolving at an exceptionally rapid pace. As snapshot of the current state of research, it is inevitable that new and relevant work will emerge between the time of writing and publication. Finally, this paper is systematic review and synthesis of existing literature. We do not present novel empirical experiments or large-scale comparative evaluation of the various methods discussed. Our contribution lies in the conceptual framework and the narrative synthesis of the described functional evolution."

The following subsections are therefore dedicated to justifying these ratings in detail, offering clear rationale for why each method was classified as it was based on its specific operational and engineering requirements. B.1 Advanced Reasoning The ratings provided in Table 4 for Computational Cost and Implementation Complexity are justified as follows, offering more detailed rationale for each classification. CISC & CER: These methods are rated High to Very High in computational cost because their core mechanism relies on sampling multiple complete reasoning paths from the LLM, which is inherently expensive and multiplies inference latency. CER is rated slightly higher as it adds an extra layer of evaluation on intermediate steps. In contrast, CISCs implementation complexity is Low as it only requires simple scoring and voting logic on the final outputs. CERs complexity is Medium because it necessitates building more sophisticated system to identify and evaluate pre-defined critical steps within reasoning chain. UAG / SPOC: These methods incur Medium computational cost as they operate within single reasoning path but add verification overhead at each step, increasing the total number of tokens generated and processed. Their implementation complexity is High because developing reliable self-correction or verification mechanism is significant challenge, often requiring complex prompting strategies or fine-tuning separate verifier model. Uncertainty-Aware FT: The key distinction here is between training and inference. The implementation complexity is High because it requires modifying the core training process, often by designing and implementing custom loss function. However, once the model is trained, the inference cost is Low as the uncertaintyawareness is baked into the models weights and does not add any extra steps or overhead at runtime. While the tables provide high-level summary, the ratings for Computational Cost and Implementation Complexity (e.g., Low, Medium, High) UnCert-CoT: This method is rated Low on both metrics, making it highly practical. The computational cost is minimal, adding only 15 Method / Framework Key Advantage(s) Key Disadvantage(s) / Failure Mode(s) Cost Complexity Between Reasoning Paths CISC CER - More efficient than standard self-consistency. - single bad step can sink good path score. - Relies on well-calibrated confidence.

Low-Medium Medium Table 4: Critical Analysis of Methods in Advanced Reasoning. This table provides comparative overview of key methodologies, focusing on their advantages, failure modes, computational costs, and implementation complexity. lightweight entropy or probability check during generation. Its implementation complexity is also low, as it can often be realized with simple wrapper that applies conditional logic (if uncertainty > threshold, then use CoT). The main challenge lies in calibration, not complex engineering. MUR: This framework is rated Low-Medium for cost and Medium for complexity. The cost is variable; it is designed to be efficient but can dynamically allocate more computational resources (like Test-Time Scaling) to uncertain steps, making it potentially more expensive than single, standard forward pass. Its implementation complexity is Medium because it requires building stateful tracking system to maintain the momentum of uncertainty across multiple generation steps, which is more involved than stateless threshold check. B.2 Autonomous Agents The ratings in Table 5 are justified by the specific operational and engineering requirements of each method: Abstention: This method earns Low rating for both cost and complexity. Computationally, it only requires lightweight calculation (e.g., entropy) on the final generated output. In terms of implementation, it is simple post-processing step, effectively an if/else check before returning response. Proactive Inquiry (UoT): Its High complexity stems from the need to implement full reinforcement learning loop, which involves defining state spaces, action policies, and complex reward functions like Expected Information Gain. The Medium-High computational cost reflects the intensive offline training and the potential for multiple model calls during inference to evaluate and select the best clarifying question. UALA: This framework is rated Low for both cost and complexity because it is designed for efficiency. It adds only single uncertainty calculation to the workflow, which is computationally cheap. Its implementation is straightforward threshold-based rule, making it one of the simplest methods to deploy. SMARTAgent: The complexity is High due to the significant upfront engineering effort required to design, create, and curate specialized dataset for fine-tuning the agent on its knowledge boundaries. While the inference cost is Low (as the decision logic is compiled into the models weights), the initial training and data collection cost is substantial. SAUP: It receives Medium rating for both cost and complexity. The cost is not fixed but scales linearly with the number of steps in an agents trajectory, as it adds calculation at each turn. The implementation requires building state-tracking system that persists across multiple turns and defining the logic for the heuristic situational weights, which is more involved than simple wrapper. UProp: This framework is rated High on both metrics due to its theoretical depth. The computational cost is significant, as it requires estimating mutual information, notoriously challenging task that often relies on expensive samplingbased methods. The implementation complexity is also high, demanding strong grasp of information theory and the development of sophisticated estimators. automatically segment reasoning chains based on entropy signals. The computational cost is considered Low as this is an efficient, one-time offline process performed before training begins. B.3 RL and Reward Modeling The ratings assigned in Table 6 are based on the specific requirements for training and implementing each RL and reward modeling method. URM (Uncertainty-Aware RM): Its implementation complexity is Medium because it requires modifying the reward models architecture (e.g., changing the output head to predict distribution) and adapting the training pipeline, often to use Maximum Likelihood Estimation loss instead of standard preference loss. The inference cost remains Low as it is still single forward pass. Bayesian RMs: This approach is rated High for complexity as it demands specialized knowledge of Bayesian deep learning techniques (e.g., variational inference, Laplace-LoRA) to implement correctly. The computational cost is Medium-High because training is often more intensive, and inference can be slower if it requires sampling from the posterior distribution to estimate uncertainty. RLSF (RL from Self-Feedback): The complexity is Medium as it involves multi-stage pipeline: generating responses, scoring them with the models own confidence, creating synthetic preference dataset, and then running standard RL algorithm. The computational cost is also Medium, reflecting the overhead of this multi-step data creation process before the main RL training begins. Confidence / Entropy Maximization: These self-improvement methods are rated Low on both metrics. They are among the easiest to implement, as they only require calculating simple, readily available metric (confidence or entropy) and using it directly as an intrinsic reward signal within standard RL loop. The computational overhead per training step is negligible. EDU-PRM: This methods primary function is in the data preparation stage. Its implementation complexity is Medium because it requires building custom data processing pipeline to Practitioners Guide to Designing Uncertainty-Aware Systems This appendix provides set of design patterns and practical recommendations for developers and researchers aiming to integrate the uncertaintyas-a-control-signal function into real-world LLM applications. C.1 Advanced Reasoning The choice of strategy for enhancing model reasoning depends on task complexity, accuracy requirements, and computational budget. Scenario 1: High-stakes, complex tasks requiring maximum accuracy (e.g., math competitions, scientific QA). Recommended Pattern: Confidence-Weighted Ensembling. Methods: Prefer fine-grained approaches like CER (Razghandi et al., 2025), which focus on the confidence of critical reasoning steps, over simpler majority voting (Self-Consistency) or whole-path scoring (CISC (Taubenfeld et al., 2025)). Practical Advice: Cost: Be aware of the high computational cost, especially for generating multiple reasoning paths. Use this for offline evaluation or latency-insensitive tasks. Calibration: The success of weighted voting hinges on the quality of confidence scores. Investing in calibrating the models confidence is crucial; otherwise, an overconfident model might assign high weights to wrong answers. Scenario 2: Tasks with variable difficulty requiring balance of efficiency and performance (e.g., code generation, general-purpose chatbots). Recommended Pattern: Uncertainty-Triggered Dynamic Allocation. Methods: UnCert-CoT (Li et al., 2025b) or MUR (Yan et al., 2025a) are ideal. They activate more 17 Method / Framework Key Advantage(s) Key Disadvantage(s) / Failure Mode(s) Cost Complexity Function: Responding to Internal Uncertainty Abstention - Simple, robust safety mechanism. - Prevents generating harmful misinformation. - Can be overly conservative, reducing helpfulness. - Performance is highly sensitive to the threshold.

High High Table 5: Critical Analysis of Methods in Autonomous Agents. This table provides comparative overview of key methodologies, focusing on their advantages, failure modes, computational costs, and implementation complexity. Method / Framework Key Advantage(s) Key Disadvantage(s) / Failure Mode(s) Cost Complexity Function: Robust Reward Models URM Bayesian RMs - Explicitly models data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty). - Simple architectural change. - May not capture models own ignorance (epistemic). - Requires changing the training objective.

Medium-High High Function: Self-Improvement RL (Intrinsic Rewards) RLSF - Requires no human preference labels; highly scalable. - Prone to reinforcing models own biases if confidence is miscalibrated (echo chamber effect). Medium Medium Confidence / Entropy Max. - Very simple to implement; reward signal is free. - Unsupervised and scalable. - Naive confidence maximization can lead to overconfident, low-quality outputs (a form of reward hacking). Low Low Function: Scalable Process Supervision EDU-PRM - Automates costly manual annotation of reasoning steps. - Enables scalable process-based supervision. - Segmentation is heuristic; high entropy might not always be true logical boundary. Low (offline) Medium Table 6: Critical Analysis of Methods in RL and Reward Modeling. This table provides comparative overview of key methodologies, focusing on their advantages, failure modes, computational costs, and implementation complexity. computationally intensive reasoning (like Chain-ofThought) only when the model exhibits confusion (high uncertainty). Practical Advice: Thresholding: The key challenge is setting an appropriate uncertainty threshold. This is often domain-specific and requires careful tuning on validation set. Signal Choice: Semantic entropy is often more stable than single-token probabilities. For structured tasks like coding, calculating uncertainty at critical decision points (e.g., the first token of new line) is an effective strategy. C.2 Autonomous Agents For agents, uncertainty management is central to ensuring both safety and efficiency in decisionmaking. Recommended Pattern: Tiered Decision Boundary. Methods: Start with simple framework like UALA (Han et al., 2024), which follows try to solve internally -> measure uncertainty -> call tool if above threshold logic. Practical Advice: Avoid Tool Overuse: Setting reasonable threshold is critical to prevent the agent from making costly and slow tool calls for simple questions. Tool Uncertainty: Do not blindly trust tool outputs. For critical applications, model the uncertainty introduced by the tool itself or implement fallback mechanisms (e.g., asking the user for clarification) when tool returns an unexpected result. Scenario 2: Agents executing long-horizon, multi-step tasks. Scenario 1: Building agents that interact with external tools (e.g., search engines, APIs). Recommended Pattern: Forward Propagation with Situational-awareness. Methods: While simple tasks can ignore cumulative uncertainty, complex workflows necessitate mechanism like SAUP (Zhao et al., 2024). Methods: Dynamically adjust the KL-divergence penalty in the PPO objective based on the RMs uncertainty (Cief et al., 2024). Practical Advice: Practical Advice: Simplified Implementation: full information-theoretic framework like UProp (Duan et al., 2025) can be complex. simpler starting point is to accumulate an uncertainty score after each thought-action-observation loop and check if it exceeds risk threshold before critical decisions (e.g., calling an expensive API or performing an irreversible action). Situational Weights: Not all steps are equally important. Identify critical nodes in the task workflow and assign higher weights to the uncertainty measured at these points. Trust but Verify: When the RM is highly uncertain, increase the KL penalty to force the policy to be more conservative and stay closer to the original SFT model. When the RM is confident, decrease the penalty to allow for more exploration. This acts as confidencebased early stopping mechanism. Intrinsic Rewards as Supplement: For highly exploratory tasks, consider combining the external RM reward with confidencebased intrinsic reward (e.g., entropy minimization (Agarwal et al., 2025)) to drive more effective autonomous learning.

            "content": "We have used LLM to polish writing for this paper. In RLHF, uncertaintys primary role is to mitigate reward hacking and achieve more robust alignment. Scenario 1: Training the Reward Model (RM). Recommended Pattern: Probabilistic Reward Modeling. Methods: Move away from traditional RMs that output single scalar. Instead, adopt models that output distribution, such as URM (Lou et al., 2024), or apply Bayesian techniques to create Bayesian RMs (Yang et al., 2024). Practical Advice: Distinguish Uncertainty Types: URM captures aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data randomness) via its architecture, while Bayesian RMs capture epistemic uncertainty (models lack of knowledge) via parameter modeling. The latter is generally more robust for out-ofdistribution (OOD) generalization. Training Objective: To effectively learn reward distribution, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) objective is often necessary, rather than the traditional Bradley-Terry preference loss. Scenario 2: Using the RM for policy optimization (e.g., with PPO).
