Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on massive internet-scale datasets have demonstrated success across diverse domains, including text generation and language understanding (Brown et al., 2020b; Dubey et al., 2024; Radford et al., 2019; Team et al., 2023b, 2024a). Their broad pre-training distribution, enables generalization to wide range of scenarios including coding assistance (Li et al., 2022), education (Team et al., 2024d), and medicine (Saab et al., 2024). Therefore, their success has sparked interest in using LLMs for decision-making problems (Chen et al., 2023; Krishnamurthy et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2024) at the core of agentic AI systems (Durante et al., 2024). One key hypothesis is that LLMs can generate informed action predictions without extensive environment interaction (Lu et al., 2024) due to world knowledge present in the model. Moreover, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) equips models with the ability to reason about the observed history and their actions, which facilitates environment interaction. However, these advantages do not seem to materialize into strong performance when LLMs are faced with decision-making scenarios. Notably, Krishnamurthy et al. (2024) and Nie et al. (2024) found that LLMs do not robustly engage in exploration resulting in sub-optimal behavior. Similar shortcomings of LLMs have been observed by Paglieri et al. (2024) and Ruoss et al. (2024) on stateful environments commonly used in RL (e.g., grid-worlds, Atari). Both works attribute the shortcomings to the knowing-doing gap, which states that models can posses knowledge about task or can describe the consequences of their behavior (i.e., they know what to do), but cannot materialize this knowledge when acting (i.e., incapable of doing). Consequently, sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap are considerable obstacles towards more powerful agentic LLMs. In this work, we aim to understand why LLMs often perform sub-optimally in simple decision-making scenarios. In particular, we systematically study three prevalent failure modes in small-to-mediumscale LLMs: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap (see Section 4.2). Our analysis shows that final performance often remains sub-optimal, because LLMs prematurely commit to greedy Corresponding author(s): schmied@ml.jku.at, razp@google.com 5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 8 7 0 6 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Figure 1 Illustration of our Reinforcement Learning Fine Tuning (RLFT) pipeline. We fine-tune pre-trained LLM 𝜋𝜃 via self-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales on environment rewards. action selection strategies leading to stagnating action coverage that leave large part of the action space unexplored (up to 55%). Moreover, we observe that small-scale LLMs (2B) tend to copy the most frequent actions in the context regardless of their respective reward, which we refer to as frequency bias. In contrast, larger LLMs (27B) mostly diminish the frequency bias, yet they remain prone to greedy behavior at the cost of exploration. Similarly, we quantify the knowing-doing gap and find that LLMs often know how to solve task (87% correct rationales) but fail at acting on this knowledge as they prioritize greedy actions (64% of actions when rationale is correct). To overcome these shortcomings, we propose Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) on selfgenerated CoT rationales. RL is the pre-dominant learning paradigm in decision-making scenarios and has been successful in game-playing (Silver et al., 2016; Vinyals et al., 2019), robotics (Tirumala et al., 2025), plasma-control (Degrave et al., 2022), or navigating stratospheric balloons (Bellemare et al., 2020). We study the effects of RLFT on pre-trained Gemma2 models (Team et al., 2024b,c) in three sizes (2B, 9B, and 27B) in multi-arm bandit (MAB) and contextual bandit (CB) settings proposed by Nie et al. (2024), and the textual Tic-tac-toe environment released by Ruoss et al. (2024). Across environments, we find that RLFT enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. While RLFT positively affects exploration of LLM agents, their exploration strategies remain sub-optimal. Therefore, we empirically evaluate both classic exploration mechanisms commonly employed in RL, such as 𝜖-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning for decision-making scenarios. Finally, in our ablations we investigate the importance of CoT reasoning for decision-making, highlight the effectiveness of leveraging expert data, and show the benefits of giving the agent more reasoning tokens to solve the decision-making problem. In summary, we make the following contributions: We systematically examine three failure modes of small-to-medium scale LLMs in decisionmaking scenarios: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We study how fine-tuning LLMs via RL on self-generated CoT rationales affects these shortcomings, highlighting positive effects of RLFT on exploration and decision-making abilities. We evaluate variety of exploration mechanisms (e.g., 𝜖-greedy) and LLM-specific approaches (e.g., self-consistency), to enable more effective RLFT for LLMs. 2 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities 2. Related Work Exploration in RL and LLMs. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is long-standing challenge in the field of RL (Oudeyer et al., 2007; Schmidhuber, 1991a,b; Still and Precup, 2012). Widely used RL agents have often relied on random schemes (Mnih et al., 2015), heuristics such as state-visitation counts (Ecoffet et al., 2019; Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020), intrinsic curiosity (Burda et al., 2018; Groth et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2017), behavior priors (Rao et al., 2021), or maximum entropy regularization (Haarnoja et al., 2018; Schulman et al., 2017). Naturally, number of works looked into leveraging LLMs for improving exploration of RL agents either as source of rewards (Klissarov et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024) or to orchestrate exploration strategies (Klissarov et al., 2024). Krishnamurthy et al. (2024) investigate the in-context exploration abilities of LLMs when acting directly as policy. Similarly, Nie et al. (2024) study the exploration abilities of LLMs when fine-tuned on expert trajectories. In contrast, our work investigates the effects of RLFT on the exploration abilities of LLMs and focuses on why models fail. In-context Learning for Decision-Making. ICL is form of Meta-learning, also referred to as learningto-learn (Schmidhuber, 1987). While meta-learning is targeted via meta-training phase (Duan et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017; Flennerhag et al., 2019; Kirsch et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2018; Santoro et al., 2016; Team et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2016), ICL emerges as result of the pre-training data distribution (Chan et al., 2022; Kirsch et al., 2022). ICL has been rediscovered in LLMs (Brown et al., 2020a) after initial observations by Hochreiter et al. (2001) in LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Mirchandani et al. (2023) leverage the ICL abilities of LLMs to operate as general pattern machines. number of works leverage the CoT abilities (Wei et al., 2022) of LLMs in simple text-based scenarios (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022). Similar in-context abilities have been observed in decision-making with models trained from scratch, albeit in restricted environments (Kirsch et al., 2023; Laskin et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022; Raparthy et al., 2023; Schmied et al., 2024a,b). Self-Correction in LLMs. critical component for LLM agents is the ability to self-correct over previously explored attempts. Existing works focus primarily on math benchmarks (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Welleck et al., 2022). Zelikman et al. (2022) leverage hints to iteratively generate correct answers and fine-tune on the respective CoT rationales. Kumar et al. (2024) employ RLFT over multiple trials to induce self-correction. Similarly, Zelikman et al. (2024) make use of RL fine-tuning, but instead generate rationales at every token position. Instead of imitation, Wang et al. (2025) rely on critique fine-tuning to induce self-correction. Wulfmeier et al. (2024) make use of inverse RL to avoid compounding errors. Other works rely on ICL abilities to learn from previous mistakes (Monea et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). While conceptual corrections are possible, exact token-level correction is usually difficult for autoregressive generation (Cundy and Ermon, 2023). 3. Methodology 3.1. Background Reinforcement Learning. We assume the standard RL formulation via Markov Decision Process (MDP) represented by tuple of (S, A, P, R), where and denote state and action spaces, respectively. At every timestep 𝑡 the agent observes state 𝑠𝑡 S, predicts action 𝑎𝑡 A, and receives reward 𝑟𝑡 given by the reward function (𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡). (𝑠𝑡+1 𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) defines the transition dynamics constituting probability distribution over next states 𝑠𝑡+1. The goal of RL is to learn policy 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) with parameters 𝜃 that predicts an action 𝑎𝑡 in state 𝑠𝑡 that maximizes cumulative reward. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. RLHF aims to fine-tune pre-trained models towards human preferences (Christiano et al., 2017). Preferences are typically encoded via reward LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities model 𝑟𝜙 with parameters 𝜙 learned from human annotated dataset consisting of query-response pairs 𝑥 and 𝑦, respectively. RLHF optimizes constrained REINFORCE estimator (Williams, 1992): max 𝜃 𝔼𝑥D,𝑦𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) (cid:2)(𝑟𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) 𝑏)𝜃 log 𝜋𝜃( 𝑦 𝑥) 𝛽𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝜋𝜃( 𝑥) 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 ( 𝑥)(cid:3) (1) Here 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 is reference policy, which is typically the frozen pre-trained model, and 𝛽 is as weighting term. The baseline 𝑏 represents baseline to reduce variance and is commonly instantiated by value function (Ouyang et al., 2022; Schulman et al., 2017) or Monte-Carlo (MC) estimate of the returns (Ahmadian et al., 2024; Ramesh et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024). 3.2. Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) Our RLFT approach relies on fine-tuning on self-generated CoT rationales on rewards obtained from environment interaction. During RLFT the model learns to iteratively refine its reasoning process, favoring CoT patterns and actions that lead to higher rewards (see Figure 1). Our approach is similar to Guo et al. (2025) and Zhai et al. (2025), but specialized for decision-making scenarios. Context Representation. The input tokens to our model at step 𝑡 consists of input instructions 𝑐𝑖𝑛 𝑡 , output instructions 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 (see Figure 1). The history representation contains the trajectory 𝜏𝑡𝐶:𝑡 = (𝑠𝑡𝐶, 𝑎𝑡𝐶, 𝑟𝑡𝐶, . . . , 𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡, 𝑟𝑡) of the 𝐶 most recent states, actions, and rewards. We opt for task-specific instructions for 𝑐𝑖𝑛 𝑡 rather than generic instruction template, providing the agent with information about the observations, the possible actions, and its objective. Consequently, 𝑐𝑡 is represented by the concatenation of the instruction and history tokens 𝑐𝑡 = [𝑐𝑖𝑛 , and the most recent interaction history 𝑐𝜏𝑡𝐶:𝑡 ; 𝑐𝜏𝑡𝐶:𝑡 𝑡 ; 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑡 ]. 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 ; 𝑎𝑡] containing both the CoT reasoning tokens 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 Factorization of Action Tokens. At every interaction step 𝑡, the agent generates action tokens 𝑧𝑡 = [𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 and the action to be executed in the environment 𝑎𝑡. To extract 𝑎𝑡 from 𝑧𝑡, we make use of an extraction function 𝑎𝑡 = 𝑔(𝑧𝑡). In practice, 𝑔 consists of regular expressions to match the output pattern given by 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑡 . If no valid action is found random action is executed. To allow for flexibility in refining the reasoning process, we opt for permissive output template (i.e., ACTION=X), rather than enforcing structured output template (e.g., <thought> and <action> blocks). We employ token generation budget of 𝐺 tokens (𝐺 = 256 by default), therefore 𝑧𝑡 𝐺. 𝑡 𝑡 Reward Shaping for Valid Actions. , we employ reward shaping term 𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 𝑡 + 𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 . 𝑡 More specifically, we make use of reward penalty of 5 if 𝑔 cannot extract valid action, 𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 = 𝑡 5 1(𝑔(𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑡 ) A). To ensure that the reward penalty does not overly bias optimization, we employ reward normalization to the environment rewards. to encourage the model to adhere to the output template, 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑣 In addition to the environment reward 𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑣 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 Fine-tuning objective. We fine-tune using the clipping objective introduced by Schulman et al. (2017) with and additional KL constraint to the reference policy 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 : (cid:18) 𝜋𝜃(𝑧𝑐) 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑧𝑐) (cid:18) 𝜋𝜃(𝑧𝑐) 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑧𝑐) 𝛽𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝜋𝜃(𝑐)𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑐)) 𝐴𝑎𝑑𝑣, clip𝜖 𝔼(𝑐,𝑧)D max 𝜃 𝐴𝑎𝑑𝑣 min (2) (cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:20) (cid:21) Here 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 refers to the rollout generating policy, 𝐷 is the rollout buffer, and 𝜖 is hyperparameter. To allow for memory efficient fine-tuning in environments with fixed episode lengths (bandits), we make use of Monte Carlo baseline to estimate 𝐴𝑎𝑑𝑣. Instead of exploiting multiple rollouts, as used by Ahmadian et al. (2024) and Ramesh et al. (2024), we compute rewards-to-go. For environments with variable episode lengths (Tic-tac-toe), we learn separate state-value head on top of the last layer LLM representations and make use of generalized advantage estimation (Schulman et al., 2015). We provide additional implementation and training details in Appendix B. 4 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities 4. Experiments We study the effect of fine-tuning Gemma2 (Team et al., 2024b,c) models in MAB and CB settings proposed by Nie et al. (2024), and on text-based version of Tic-tac-toe released by Paglieri et al. (2024). We describe our environments and baselines in Section 4.1. For our experiments, we compare Gemma2 (Team et al., 2024c) models at three model scales: 2B, 9B and 27B. In Section 4.2, we first analyze three common failure modes of LLM agents in MAB scenarios: (1) greediness, (2) frequency bias, and (3) the knowing-doing gap. Then we investigate the effects of fine-tuning on self-generated CoT rationales or expert rationales in MABs and CBs (see Section 4.3), and in Tic-tac-toe (see Section 4.5). In Section 4.4, we study the effects of exploration mechanisms on the fine-tuning performance. Finally, in Section 4.5 we empirically examine important components of our approach. 4.1. Environments & Baselines Multi-armed and Contextual Bandits. MABs (Lattimore and Szepesvári, 2020; Slivkins et al., 2019) are classic problem setting in RL that isolates the exploration-exploitation trade-off. For our MAB experiments, we leverage the text-based bandit scenarios released by Nie et al. (2024). We focus on the continuous and button variants, as illustrated in Figure 2. We report results for MAB with 𝑘 {5, 10, 20} arms (A = 𝑘) and payoffs of the arms being either Gaussian or Bernoulli distributed. In addition, we consider three levels of stochasticity (low/medium/high) that determine the standard deviation or delta gap in Gaussian or Bernoulli bandits, respectively. For all MAB settings, we limit the horizon 𝑇 to 50 interaction steps. We compare against two commonly used baselines for MABs: Upper-confidence Bound (UCB) (Auer, 2002) and random agent that selects actions uniformly at random. UCB is considered optimal and represents the upperbound for agent performance, whereas the random baseline represents the lower bound. We provide more details on our MAB and CB setups in Appendices A.1 and A.2, respectively. Button Multi-armed Bandit (Gaussian) You are bandit algorithm in room with 5 buttons [...]. labeled red, green, blue, yellow, orange. Your goal is to maximize the total reward.

What do you predict next? Tic-tac-toe. In addition, we use the text-based Tic-tac-toe environment released by Ruoss et al. (2024), which exhibits proper state transitions. Ruoss et al. (2024) demonstrated that frontier models struggle to achieve strong performance in this environment and barely beat random opponent. Consequently, it is good target to investigate the efficacy of RLFT. In Appendix A.3, we provide addition details on our environment and training setup. Figure 2 Illustration of Gaussian MAB for the button scenario from (Nie et al., 2024) using our context representation and instructions. 4.2. Why do LLMs perform suboptimally in decision-making? Prior works found that LLM agents perform suboptimally and fail to explore sufficiently in interactive settings (Paglieri et al., 2024; Ruoss et al., 2024). Therefore, we first examine why models perform 5 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities suboptimally and identify three prevalent failure modes: (1) greediness, (2) frequency bias, and (3) the knowing-doing gap. In this section, we present analyses of Gemma2 models when given input contexts that elucidate the failure modes. We conduct our analyses on the button instance of our MAB experiments at three model scales, and find that the failure modes persist across model scales (see Appendix C.1 for continuous instance). (a) Action Coverage: 10 arms (b) Action Coverage: 20 arms (c) Coverage vs. Regret: 10 arms Figure 3 Illustration of Greediness. We show action coverage for Gemma2 2B/9B/27B w/ and w/o CoT for (a) 10 and (b) 20 arms over 50 interaction steps. Agents favor the best performing action among the set of selected actions, leading to stagnating action coverage, despite benefits of larger models and CoT. In (c), we plot cumulative regret against action coverage. The agents exhibit suboptimal regret, because of greedy action selection strategies. Greediness. The first and most pervasive failure mode is greediness, which is characterized by the LLM overly favoring the best performing action among small set of actions seen so far. To illustrate this failure mode, we show the average action coverage achieved by Gemma2 2B/9B/27B with and without CoT across 64 MABs with 10 and 20 arms over 50 interaction steps (see Figure 3 and b). We define action coverage 𝐶𝑡 at step 𝑡 as the fraction of available actions that have been selected at least once, 𝐶𝑡 = {𝑎 A: 𝑁𝑡 (𝑎) >0} with 𝑁𝑡 (𝑎) representing the number of times action 𝑎 has been selected until 𝑡. For 10 arms and averaged over 64 parallel environments, we find that Gemma2 2B covers 40% of all actions, while 9B/27B cover 65% (i.e., 6.5 actions), leaving significant part of the action space unexplored. Note that without CoT all models explore merely 25% of all actions in the 10 arms setting. The suboptimal coverage is caused by the model overly favoring high-reward actions (see Figure 15 in Appendix C.1.1). Consequently, the model prematurely commits to greedy strategy leading to stagnating action coverage beyond 10 steps. Increasing the number of arms makes the greediness even more apparent, with the largest models only covering 45% of all actions. Due to this, the regret remains high compared to UCB, even though the models improve significantly over random agent (see Figure 3c). Frequency Bias. The next prevalent failure mode is frequency bias, which is characterized by repeatedly selecting the most frequently occurring action in the context, even when that action gives low reward. To understand how the models behavior is influenced by the frequency of actions, we construct prefix histories using random policy, vary the number of repetitions of the last action in the context history (0 to 100) and record the entropy over all actions (see Figure 4a and c). We provide details on the context generation in Appendix C.1.2. To quantify frequency bias, we categorize an action as frequent action 𝑎 𝑓 = arg max𝑎 𝐴 𝑁𝑇 (𝑎), greedy 𝑎𝑔 = arg max𝑎 {𝑎 𝐴:𝑁𝑇 (𝑎) >0} 𝑅𝑇 (𝑎), or other if they are neither frequent nor greedy. Note that action is optimal with 10% probability. Subsequently, we compute the frequent 𝐹 𝑓 , greedy 𝐹𝑔 and other 𝐹𝑜 fractions as reported in Figure 4 (see Appendix 4 for definitions). 6 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities (a) 2B: Correlations (b) Strategy per Window (c) 27B: Correlations Figure 4 Illustration of Frequency Bias. We plot the frequency of the repeated action in the context against the action entropy across all actions for 10 armed MABs. (a) Gemma2 2B heavily suffers from frequency bias, becoming more certain of the most frequent action, the more often it occurs in the context. (c) Gemma2 27B overcomes the frequency bias, but instead behaves greedily. In (b) we show the action strategies for three repetition windows. Gemma2 2B heavily suffers from repeated actions, exhibiting decreasing entropy with increasing repetitions (96% 𝐹 𝑓 , see Figure 4a). In contrast, 27B escapes the frequency bias (14%, see Figure 4c) and interestingly becomes less certain of its action prediction with increasing repetitions. To examine this further, we show the bucketized fractions with 0-10, 45-55 and 90-100 repetitions for 2B and 27B in Figure 4b. Indeed, for 2B 𝐹 𝑓 keeps increasing with increasing repetitions. While 27B escapes the frequency bias it suffers heavily from greediness. Similar biases have been identified in Behavior Cloning (BC) settings and termed copycat bias (Schmied et al., 2024b; Wen et al., 2020). This suggests that frequency bias is an artifact of supervised pre-training, and motivates the use of RL as counter-measurement. Knowing-Doing Gap. The knowing-doing gap has been observed by Paglieri et al. (2024) and Ruoss et al. (2024). To illustrate the gap in our setting, we first task Gemma2 27B to produce the UCB algorithm, to compute the relevant quantities accordingly (\"knowing\"), and finally to act according to the computed quantities (\"doing\", see Figure 22 for the instructions and an agent response). We let Gemma2 27B interact with the environment (64 instances) for 50 timesteps with 𝐺 = 2048 per step, and extract the UCB quantities from the rationales. To quantify \"knowing\", we compare the UCB values computed by the model against the real UCB values, and consider the rationale 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 as correct if the arm with the highest UCB values match (see Appendix C.1.3 for details). To quantify \"doing\", we categorize the generated actions as optimal action if the model selects the action with the highest UCB value, as Figure 5 Confusion matrix for the KnowingDoing Gap of Gemma2 27B. The agent knows how to solve the task (87% correct rationales, sum of top row), but fails at \"doing\" (58% greedy actions among correct rationales). See Figure 22, for instructions and an agent response. LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities greedy if it selects the action with the highest UCB value among the set of actions tried so far, and as other if the action is neither optimal nor greedy. Subsequently, we compute the percentages of greedy/optimal/other actions. The agent clearly knows how to solve the task, with 87% of all rationales being correct (see Figure 5). However, even for correctly computed rationales, the model often selects the greedy action (58%) over the optimal action (21%). This discrepancy highlights the shortcomings of the LLM when it comes to \"acting\" even when \"knowing\" the algorithm. 4.3. Effectiveness of RL Fine-Tuning Figure 6 Main Comparison on Gaussian MABs button scenario in the medium noise (𝜎 = 1) setting. We compare cumulative regrets (lower is better) of classic baselines against ICL and RLFT performances for 5, 10, and 20 arms. See Figure 19 for 𝜎 = 0.1 and 𝜎 = 3. Next, we study the effects of RLFT on cumulative regret (w.r.t. optimal policy) and whether it alleviates the highlighted failure modes. We fine-tune Gemma2 2B and 9B on self-generated CoT rationales for 30K updates with an (accumulated) batch size of 128. To avoid memorization of reward distributions, we maintain pool of 512 MABs and randomly select subset of 16 MABs per rollout. We refer to Appendix for training details and hyperparameters. RLFT lowers regret. In Figure 6, we report the cumulative regrets across model sizes and arms for medium noise 𝜎 = 1.0 scenario (see Appendix C.2 for low/high noise). Across environments, the LLMs clearly outperform the random baseline and RLFT lowers regret for both 2B and 9B. For 2B, RLFT narrows the gap to its larger counterparts and UCB. Similarly, RLFT lowers regret for Gemma2 9B. Note, that the lower cumulative regret of Gemma2 9/27B compared to UCB after 50 environment steps in the 20 arms scenario is an artifact of the limited interaction steps, but the trends remain clear. We repeat RLFT for CBs, and observe similar performance improvements for Gemma2 2B (see Appendix C.3). Consequently, reinforcing self-generated CoT rationales towards environment rewards improves performance on simple decision-making scenarios. Figure 7 Effect of RLFT on greediness for Gemma2 2B. RLFT mitigates greediness. In Figure 7, we report the action coverage for 2B after RLFT at different numbers of gradient steps (10K, 20K, 30K). Indeed, we observe that RLFT results in increased action coverage (+12%) after 30K updates. Interestingly, we first observe decrease (at 10K) followed by an increase in action coverage (20K, 30K). We observe similar effects for the 20 arms scenario (see Figure 17). Via RLFT the agent learns to explore and consequently mitigates greediness. 8 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities RLFT counteracts frequency bias. We find that RLFT counteracts frequency bias (Figure 18). In particular, for 0-10 repetitions we observe strong decrease in the fraction of frequent actions (70% 35%) and increase in \"other\" actions (8% 35%). However, 𝐹 𝑓 remains elevated for high repetitions. Consequently, RLFT counteracts frequency bias, but does not fully alleviate it. 4.4. Effect of Exploration Mechanisms While RLFT decreases regret and encourages exploration, we observe that the action coverage remains sub-optimal (see Section 4.3). For RLFT, we relied solely on the exploration properties for CoT reasoning. However, in RL it is common practice to employ additional exploration strategies (Haarnoja et al., 2018; Mnih et al., 2015; Schulman et al., 2017). Therefore, we study the effects of classic exploration mechanisms and LLM-specific strategies to encourage exploration. We compare: (1) try-all actions initially similar to UCB, (2) 𝜖-greedy, (3) context randomization, (4) context summary similar to Krishnamurthy et al. (2024) and Nie et al. (2024), (5) self-correction similar to Kumar et al. (2024), (6) self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022), and (7) exploration bonus. We provide details on mechanisms in Appendix B.4. Figure 8 Effect of exploration mechanisms on action coverage and cumulative regret. Across model scales, we observe that the mechanisms result in varied effects on action coverage (see Figure 8). First, we find that the simple try-all strategy, which reduces the need for additional exploration by trying all actions, results in the biggest performance improvements. Gemma2 27B almost closes the gap to the optimal UCB agent. This suggests that only given sufficient information about the (sub-)optimality of actions, LLMs are able to select actions accordingly, underscoring their exploration shortcomings. Second, we observe that RLFT lowers regret and improves exploration across different exploration mechanisms. Most importantly, simple exploration bonus (+1 reward for untried actions during RLFT), significantly increases exploration (50% 70%) and lowers regret towards the expert compared to regular RLFT. This highlights the importance of reward shaping for fine-tuning LLMs in decision-making scenarios to elucidate desired behavior. 4.5. Ablations RLFT in Tic-tac-toe. To investigate the efficacy of RLFT in stateful environments, we evaluate on Tic-tac-toe from Ruoss et al. (2024), in which frontier models struggle to achieve strong performance (see Appendix for training details). We fine-tune against three opponents: random agent, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2006), and noisy MCTS (50% of actions selected at random). We find that RLFT significantly enhances the win-rate of Gemma2 2B against all opponent compared LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities to ICL (see Figure 9a). Against the random agent, RLFT elevates the average return from 0.15 (i.e., winning 15% of games) to 0.75. Notably, the agent even manages to draw against the optimal MCTS baseline (0.95 0.0), underscoring the effectiveness of RLFT for decision-making. However, for high performance it is essential to provide the legal actions in the context (see Figure 21). Importance of CoT for RLFT. CoT reasoning is critical for ICL performance (see Figure 3), but the question remains how CoT influences RLFT. Therefore, we run RLFT on Gemma2 2B on the 10 arms Gaussian MAB both w/ and w/o CoT (see Figure 9b, RLFT). Indeed, without CoT, RLFT barely attains the performance of ICL w/ CoT. This highlights the function of CoT as vital exploration and rationalization mechanism for decision-making.

(b) Effect of CoT on ICL, RLFT and SFT (expert data) performance on MABs. (c) Effect of increasing the number of \"thinking\" tokens to generate during RLFT. Expert Behavior Cloning vs. Thought Cloning. BC is prevalent approach in sequence models for decision-making (Brohan et al., 2022, 2023; Pomerleau, 1988) and relies on expert datasets. Consequently, we construct two UCB expert dataset comprising 32K rollouts (1.6M transitions) across different MABs either w/ or w/o CoT (see Figure 12) and perform SFT on them. Notably, both SFT variants successfully mimic the expert achieving comparable regret to UCB (see Figure 9b, SFT). This result underscores the effectiveness of expert data in decision-making, echoing recent findings in reasoning tasks (Muennighoff et al., 2025). Effect of \"Thinking\" Time. Finally, we investigate the effect of giving the agent more/less time to \"think\" during RLFT by varying the generation budget 𝐺 (see Figure 9c and Appendix D). Decreasing 𝐺 results in poor performance, as the agent is unable to rationalize its decisions. Increasing 𝐺 to 512 improves performance to the level of 9B w/ RLFT. The agent effectively leverages the additional tokens, which reflects recent observations in mathematical reasoning (Guo et al., 2025). However, when increasing 𝐺, rollout generation can make up the majority of the training time due to the multi-step nature of decision-making tasks (e.g., for 𝐻 = 50, 𝐺 = 500 the agent generates 25K tokens). 5. Conclusion In this work, we study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. We examine three prevalent failure modes of LLMs: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We show that RLFT on CoT rationales mitigates greediness, counteracts frequency bias, and improves final performance. While RLFT improves the exploration, it remains sub-optimal compared to bandit algorithms. Therefore, we investigate variety of mechanisms, such as 𝜖-greedy or self-consistency, to LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities improve exploration. Models act near-optimally if provided with sufficient information underscoring their shortcomings in exploration. Finally, we highlight the importance of reward shaping for RLFT. Limitations & Future Work. We focused our evaluation on the Gemma2 series and small-to-medium scale models. While we expect that our findings transfer to larger models, we deem research into frontier models important. Moreover, our MAB experiments were conducted with limited horizon of 50 environment steps, which is sufficient for 5 and 10 arms, but insufficient for 20 arms. For future work, we believe that evaluating the exploration abilities of LLM agents is particularly interesting in environments that require targeted exploration towards an end-goal. First, this includes other stateful environments from Paglieri et al. (2024) and Ruoss et al. (2024), such as Crafter (Hafner, 2021). Second, we deem systematic investigation into exploration abilities of LLMs in existing agentic benchmarks (He et al., 2024; Mialon et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023) interesting. In our ablation studies, we found that LLMs benefit from additional \"thinking\" time and believe that allowing for larger generation budget will become increasingly important for agentic scenarios, especially for scenarios with high-stakes decisions (e.g., economics or ethics). We deem investigations into such high-stakes scenarios fruitful for future work. While increasing \"thinking\" time improves performance, it comes with excessive computational cost at training time due to the rollout generation and the multi-step nature of decision-making. Therefore, modern recurrent architectures (Beck et al., 2025; De et al., 2024) that allow for faster inference may be promising alternatives for decision-making."

Environments & Datasets We conduct experiments on three sets of environments: multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits and tic-tac-toe. For the SFT experiments reported in Section 4.5, we generate our own expert datasets. In this section, we provide additional details on our environments and datasets. A.1. Multi-arm Bandits: BanditBench MABs (Lattimore and Szepesvári, 2020; Slivkins et al., 2019) are classic problem setting in RL that isolates the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In contrast, commonly used RL environments (Bellemare et al., 2013; Tassa et al., 2018) often conflate exploration with other RL-specific aspects, such as delayed rewards (Arjona-Medina et al., 2019). We rely on the MAB scenarios released in BanditBench (Nie et al., 2024) and also used by (Krishnamurthy et al., 2024). MABs come with number of variable dimensions including the scenario type (textual description of the task), the type of reward distribution (Gaussian, Bernoulli) and its corresponding noise level (low/medium/high), LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities the number of arms (i.e., actions), and the number of interaction steps per episode. Consequently, MABs are good testbed for LLM agents. We focus on the continuous and button variants released by Nie et al. (2024). We report results for MAB with 𝑘 {5, 10, 20} arms (A = 𝑘) for three levels of stochasticity (low/medium/high). In our experiments, for every arm the corresponding reward is sampled from Gaussian distribution 𝑟 (𝜇, 𝜎) where 𝜇 (0, 1) and is fixed scalar 𝜎 {0.1, 1, 3} for the three levels of stochasticity, respectively. For all MAB settings, we limit the horizon 𝑇 to 50 interaction steps. Limiting the horizon is necessary to handle the increasing lengths and consequently RAM requirements for fine-tuning. While we consider 50 interaction steps sufficient for 5 and 10 arms, it is insufficient for the 20 arms scenario. However, note that the general trends are well observable for the 20 arms scenario. In Figure 10, we show the continuous and button Gaussian MABs with CoT instructions for the agent. Similarly, in Figure 11 we show the same instances without CoT instructions. Continuous MAB (Gaussian) Button MAB (Gaussian) You are bandit algorithm and interact with 5 arms labeled 0,1,2,3,4. Each arm is associated with Bernoulli/Gaussian distribution with fixed but unknown mean; the means for the arms could be different. For either arm, when you use it, you will get reward that is sampled from the arms associated distribution. You have 50 time steps and, on each time step, you MUST choose one of the arms and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward. You are bandit algorithm in room with 5 buttons labeled red, green, blue, yellow, orange. Each button is associated with Bernoulli/Gaussian distribution with fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For either button, when you press it, you will get reward that is sampled from the buttons associated distribution. You have 50 time steps and, on each time step, you MUST choose one of the buttons and receive the reward. Your goal is to maximize the total reward over the 50 time steps.

Figure 10 Illustration of continuous and button Gaussian multi-armed bandits scenarios from BanditBench (Nie et al., 2024) using our context representation and with CoT instructions. A.1.1. Baselines. We compare against two commonly used baselines for MABs: Upper-confidence Bound (UCB) (Auer, 2002) and random agent that selects actions uniformly at random (see Appendix for details). UCB is considered optimal and represents the upper-bound for agent performance, whereas the random baseline represents the lower bound. We provide implementations details for all baselines in Appendix B. A.1.2. SFT Datasets. In our main experiments, we focused on self-generated CoT rationales and action predictions produced by our fine-tuned agents, which do not require pre-collected dataset. In contrast, for our SFT experiments reported in Section 4.5, we generated UCB expert datasets. In particular, we construct LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Continuous MAB (Gaussian) Button MAB (Gaussian) You are bandit algorithm and interact with 5 arms labeled 0,1,2,3,4.

Figure 11 Illustration of continuous and button Gaussian multi-armed bandits scenarios from BanditBench (Nie et al., 2024) using our context representation without CoT instructions. two dataset instances: behavior cloning dataset that only contains expert actions and thought cloning (TC) dataset that incorporates expert actions alongside thought process for coming up with the respective action (i.e., w/ CoT). For every arm and stochasticity level combination, we construct 32K rollouts from different MABs, which amounts to 1.6M transitions (state, action, reward) per dataset. To provide the thought process in the TC datasets, we reconstruct the computations of the UCB values conducted by the UCB expert in textual format. The thought process ends with final conclusion why particular action was selected (i.e., highest UCB value or exploratory action). Consequently, the action 𝑧𝑡 at step 𝑡 contains the thought process 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 and the action to execute 𝑎𝑡 (see Section 3.2). We illustrate the actions contained in the dataset for trajectory at steps 4 and 11 in Figure 12. The BC datasets do not contain the thought process. Instead, they only contain the final predictions made by the model, for example ACTION=yellow as shown in Figure 12. A.2. Contextual Bandits MABs do not emit states. In contrast, CBs emit state representations at every interaction step, making them contextual. Consequently, CBs are interesting to test abilities of LLMs to make use of the given context when predicting the next action. For our CB experiments, we leverage the MovieLens environment released by Nie et al. (2024), semisynthetic bandit task based on the MovieLens dataset (Harper and Konstan, 2015). In this setting, the agent operates as movie recommendation engine given contextual description of user (10K users in total) and list of 𝐾 possible movies. The context representation provides textual description of the user to recommend the movie to. This description includes the users gender, age, profession, location, and numeric description of the users preferences for each of the possible movies. As for MABs, we report results for 𝐾 {5, 10, 20}, limit the horizon to 50 interaction steps. In Figure 13, we provide an example for MovieLens CB with 5 actions with our context representation and CoT instructions. Baselines. Similar to MABs, we compare against LinUCB (Chu et al., 2011) and an agent selecting actions uniformly at random. We provide implementation details on our baselines in Appendix B. LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Multi-armed Bandit at step 4 Lets think step-by-step. We calculate the counts and means for every action. [More Thoughts] Count for action blue = 1, Mean = (-1.91) / 1 = -1.91, UCB = -1.91 + sqrt(1 / 1)) = -0.91 Count for action green = 1, Mean = (1.41) / 1 = 1.41, UCB = 1.41 + sqrt(1 / 1)) = 2.41 Count for action red = 1, Mean = (0.45) / 1 = 0.45, UCB = 0.45 + sqrt(1 / 1)) = 1.45 Count for action yellow = 0, Mean = NaN, UCB = NaN Count for action orange = 0, Mean = NaN, UCB = NaN We have not yet selected all actions. Therefore, we select the next one. ACTION=yellow Multi-armed Bandit at step 11 Lets think step-by-step. We calculate the counts and means for every action. [More Thoughts] Count for action blue = 1, Mean = (-1.91) / 1 = -1.91, UCB = -1.91 + sqrt(1 / 1)) = -0.91 Count for action green = 4, Mean = (1.41 + 0.17 + 0.67 + -0.1) / 4 = 0.54, UCB = 0.54 + sqrt(1 / 4)) = 1.04 Count for action red = 3, Mean = (0.45 + 0.78 + 2.16) / 3 = 1.13, UCB = 1.13 + sqrt(1 / 3)) = 1.71 Count for action yellow = 1, Mean = (-1.03) / 1 = -1.03, UCB = -1.03 + sqrt(1 / 1)) = -0.03 Count for action orange = 1, Mean = (-1.2) / 1 = -1.2, UCB = -1.2 + sqrt(1 / 1)) = -0.2 We select actions according to the highest UCB value. Therefore, action red is selected. ACTION=red Figure 12 Illustration of UCB rationales contained in our SFT expert datasets at two timesteps (4 and 11) in the same trajectory. Both examples show the Thought Cloning dataset instance containing both the produced CoT rationale along with the predicted action. The Behavior Cloning instances contain only the final action prediction (in red). A.3. Tic-tac-toe Finally, we use the text-based Tic-tac-toe environment released by Ruoss et al. (2024) (see Figure 14 for an example). Unlike MABs and CBs, Tic-tac-toe is stateful environment with proper state transitions (i.e., action predicted at step 𝑡 affects the state observed at step 𝑡 + 1). The agent receives scalar rewards of 1, 0, and -1 for winning, drawing, and loosing against its opponent, respectively. Episodes last until either of the players wins, draws or looses. To enable easy extraction of actions from the generated rationales, we represent the action space as discrete set of 9 actions, corresponding to the grid positions on the 3 3 grid used in Tic-tac-toe ( = 9). However, only at the start of an episode, all 9 actions are valid. Subsequently, only subset is valid, because of taken board positions. We (optionally) provide the set of valid actions at particular step in textual form in the context given to the agent. Ruoss et al. (2024) demonstrated that frontier models struggle to achieve strong performance in this environment and barely beat random opponent. Consequently, we deem it good target to investigate the efficacy of RLFT. Baselines. Following Ruoss et al. (2024), we compare against random agent by default. In addition, we also compare against (MCTS) (Coulom, 2006), and noisy variant of MCTS that selects an action randomly with 50% chance and according to MCTS otherwise. LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities MovieLens Contextual Bandit You are an AI movie recommendation assistant for streaming platform powered by bandit algorithm that offers wide variety of films from different studios and genres. There are 5 unique movies you can recommend, named star_wars_(1977), contact_(1997), fargo_(1996), return_of_the_jedi_(1983), liar_liar_(1997). When user visits the streaming platform, you assess their demographic description to choose movie to suggest. You aim to match the user with movies they are most likely to watch and enjoy.

Step=4 This person is 28-year-old man, working as administrator and live in Santa Clara county, CA. The user has some numerical values that represent their true implicit preference or taste for all movies: [-0.04, 0.02, -0.02, -0.0, 0.02] What do you predict next? Figure 13 Illustration of contextual MovieLens scenario from BanditBench (Nie et al., 2024) using our context representation and instructions. B. Experimental & Implementation Details B.1. Training & Evaluation In our experiments, we fine-tune Gemma2 models in three model sizes (2B/9B/27B). For all experiments, we use the instruction-tuned versions of Gemma2 and leverage the respective instruction pre-and-postfixes. For bandits, we fine-tune all models for total of 30K updates and evaluate after every 10K steps. with an accumulated batch size of 128. Similarly, we fine-tune for 12K updates and evaluate every 4K updates on Tic-tac-toe. We report the mean and 95% confidence intervals over three seeds, as suggested by Agarwal et al. (2021). General. We train all agents with an accumulated batch size of 128. We use learning rate of 1𝑒4, 100 linear warm-up steps followed by cosine decay to 1𝑒6. To allow for memory-efficient finetuning of 2B and 9B models, we train using the AdaFactor optimizer (Shazeer and Stern, 2018). We experiment with LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) for fine-tuning the 9B and 27B models but found it insufficient for improving the agents decision-making abilities in our setting. However, LoRA considerably reduces the amount of memory required for RLFT and has been shows to work well for supervised fine-tuning of decision-making agents (Schmied et al., 2023). Therefore, we deem it promising candidate for RLFT in decision-making scenarios. Furthermore, we employ gradient clipping of 1.0. We list all hyperparameters in Table 1. Context Lengths & Generation Budget. For all model sizes and tasks, we use context length of 1792 for the input context. By default, we set the generation budget to 256 tokens, except for the knowing-doing gap analyses reported in Section 4.2, which require larger budget of 2048 tokens. Consequently, the effective sequence length for fine-tuning is 2048. Hardware Setup. We train all models on server equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. B.2. RLFT For our RLFT experiments on bandits, we employ the context representation, action factorization, reward shaping terms, and training objectives described in Section 3.2. To extract the target action 𝑎𝑡 from 𝑧𝑡, we make use of stack of regex expressions against the target pattern (i.e., ACTION=X) and 23 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Tic-tac-toe You are an agent playing tic-tac-toe. You observe board with 9 entries that looks like this: 000 100 002 1 indicates that player 1 has placed stone in that square. 2 indicates that player 2 has placed stone in that square. 0 indicates that no stone has been placed in that square. You play as 1. There are 9 possible actions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The actions correspond to the following board locations 012 345 [More Instructions] Think step-by-step and output your final answer in the format ACTION=X where is one of the arms listed above. IMPORTANT: Provide your (SHORT!) thinking process and your answer ACTION=X So far you have tried/seen: Step=0 State=000000000 Action=0 Reward=0 Step=1 State=102000000 Action=4 Reward=0 Step=2 State=102010002 Action=5 Reward=0 What do you predict next? Figure 14 Illustration of the text-based Tic-tac-toe environment. consider the last match in the generated tokens as 𝑎𝑡. In addition to being fairly robust, we found that this approach allows for more flexibility during the RLFT process and led to better outcomes than more structured approach. Furthermore, across model sizes, we found it essential to introduce reward shaping term to penalize rationales that contain no valid actions. By default, we use reward penalty of -5 for invalid actions. Empirically, we found that this reward shaping term is sufficient for the models to produce valid actions early on in the training. We fine-tune using the clipping objective introduced by Schulman et al. (2017) with an additional KL constraint to the reference policy 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 . We set 𝛽 = 0.05 and 𝜖 = 0.2 for all experiments. We make use of the approximated (per-token) KL divergence instead of computing the full KL. While we found that computing the full KL slightly improves performance, it slows down training considerably. In contrast to Ahmadian et al. (2024) and Ramesh et al. (2024), we do not rely on producing multiple rollouts, because it is impractical for the mutli-step nature of decision-making tasks. While generating multiple actions at particular timestep is possible for simulated environments, it requires environment resets. Therefore, we rely on standard MC-baselines to estimate 𝐴𝑎𝑑𝑣. For bandit experiments, we maintain pool of 512 stochastic MABs. For every rollout, we let the agent interact with subset of 16 bandits for single episode (50 timesteps). Consequently, every rollout contains 800 transitions. Similarly, for Tic-tac-toe, we maintain 16 parallel environments and collect 2048 rollout steps. We conduct 1 and 2 update epochs over the rollout buffer for bandits and Tic-tac-toe, respectively. B.3. SFT For our SFT experiments on MABs, we fine-tune on either on the expert action or expert rationales produced by UCB. We employ standard SFT training using cross-entropy objective on the target tokens. B.4. Exploration Mechanisms In Section 8, we compare variety of classic exploration mechanisms and LLM-specific approaches and study their effects on agent performance on Gaussian MABs with 10 arms. Here, we provide description for each mechanism.

Table 1 Default hyperparameters used in our experiments. Try-all. The try-all strategy is inspired by UCB, which incorporates an initial phase for trying all untried actions. This is because the UCB values for all untried actions are . Therefore, we incorporate the same exploration phase when performing ICL and RLFT at the beginning of every episode. To enable fine-tuning on exploration actions, we provide an action rationale template to the model (e.g., Action has not been tried yet, lets explore it. ACTION=X). While simple, we find that this try-all strategy is effective for lowering regret across all model sizes (see Figure 8). This suggests that the model is able to select appropriate actions if given sufficient information, but struggles to explore. 𝜖-greedy. 𝜖-greedy is classic exploration mechanism and commonly used in RL algorithms (Hessel et al., 2018; Mnih et al., 2015). For our experiments, we use 𝜖 = 0.1 both during training and evaluation. We explored other values for 𝜖 but did not observe performance improvements. As for the try-all strategy, we provide an action rationale template to enable fine-tuning on exploration actions. Context Randomization. Context Randomization is an LLM-specific mechanism designed to introduce randomness in the action predictions by modifying the context representation. At every interaction step, we construct mapping from the original action labels to shuffled list of the same action labels. Subsequently, we remap action in the context history according to the constructed mapping. Finally, the predicted action is mapped back to the original action label space and executed environment. Besides introducing randomness, context randomization acts as control mechanism to ensure that the observed biases do not only stem from biases towards particular action-tokens (e.g., blue occurs more often than magenta in the pre-training dataset). Context Summary. Similar to Krishnamurthy et al. (2024) and Nie et al. (2024), we evaluate the effects of providing context summary to the agent. After the context history, we provide the model with summary of that history that contains the number of times every action has been selected so far, along with their respective mean rewards. 25 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Self-Correction. Inspired by Kumar et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2025), we employ self-correction to the models predicted actions. First, we let the model generate its is initial rationale and corresponding action prediction. Then we append the generated rationale along with self-correction message (similar to Kumar et al. (2024)) to the input context, and repeat the action generation. Finally, we extract the action from the final response and execute it in the environment. For RLFT, we only fine-tune on the final response, but retain the initial response along with the self-correction message in the context. Self-Consistency. Instead of generating single answer, self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) relies on generating multiple responses. Subsequently, self-consistency employs majority voting mechanism to determine the final response. For our experiments in Figure 8, we report results for self-consistency with 16 generated responses. Instead of majority voting, we experimented with sampling from the respective response distribution or random mechanisms. Exploration Bonus. Finally, we evaluate reward shaping mechanism in the form of an exploration bonus. In particular, we give an exploration bonus of +1 if the agents selects an action not yet tried within the respective episode. While simple, we find that the exploration bonus effectively narrows the gap to the UCB expert. This highlights the importance of reward shaping for fine-tuning LLMs in decision-making scenarios.

Models exhibit overly high action probabilities in the presence of rewards, potentially resulting in repeatedly selecting sub-optimal actions C. Additional Results C.1. Failure Modes C.1.1. Greediness Greediness is characterized by the LLM overly favoring the best performing action among small set of actions seen so far. We define action coverage 𝐶𝑡 at step 𝑡 as the fraction of available actions that have been selected at least once, 𝐶𝑡 = {𝑎 A: 𝑁𝑡 (𝑎) >0} with 𝑁𝑡 (𝑎) representing the number of times action 𝑎 has been selected until 𝑡. Action probabilities. The suboptimal action coverage reported in Section 4.2 is caused by the model overly favoring high-reward actions (i.e., overly high action probabilities). In Figure C.1.1, we provide an illustration of the action probabilities for given input history. Across model sizes, Gemma2 exhibits overly high action probabilities in the presence of reward, which results in repeatedly selecting potentially suboptimal action. Greediness on Continuous MABs. We repeat the analyses conducted in Section 4.2 using numbers instead of buttons as the possible actions. Indeed, we find that the same trends hold. Without CoT the performance remains low. For Gemma2 27B, we observe an increase in the action coverage to almost 90% for the 10 arms scenario, and to 60% for the 20 arms scenario. LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities (a) Action Coverage: 10 arms (b) Action Coverage: 20 arms Figure 16 Illustration of greediness for the numbers scenario. Post RLFT. In line with Figure 7, we present the post RLFT action coverage on the 20 arms scenario in Figure 17. Similar to the effects on the 10 arms scenario, we observe that RLFT improves the action coverage by 13%. Figure 17 Effect of RLFT on greediness for 2B (20 arms, medium noise). C.1.2. Frequency Bias Frequency bias is characterized by repeatedly selecting the most frequently occurring actions in the context, even when the dominant action gives low reward. To measure frequency bias, we first construct variety of interaction histories (occurred during environment interaction) containing between 2 and 10 transitions. This interaction history is collected using random policy. Given an initial interaction history, we repeat the last action in the history, which we also refer to as target action, between 0 and 100 times. Finally, we report the entropy all actions, 𝐻 (𝜃) = (cid:205)𝑎 𝐴 𝜋𝜃(𝑎 𝜏) log 𝜋𝜃(𝑎 𝜏) . To achieve this, we conduct separate forward pass for every possible action in the action space and report the respective log probabilities. We repeat the same procedure for different interaction histories and target actions (see Figure 4a and c). For the 10 arms scenario, every interaction history therefore results in 1000 (10 arms * 100 repetitions of the target action) forward passes. We repeat this procedure for the 5 target actions reported in Figure 4 using 5 interaction histories per action, accumulating to total of 25K model forward passes (1000 * 5 * 5) per figure. To quantify frequency bias, we categorize the resulting actions as frequent action, greedy, or other if they are neither frequent nor greedy. Subsequently, we compute the frequent 𝐹 𝑓 , greedy 𝐹𝑔 and other 27 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities 𝐹𝑜 fractions as reported in Figure 4: 𝐹 𝑓 = 𝑁𝑇 (𝑎 𝑓 ) 𝑁 ; 𝐹𝑔 = 𝑁𝑇 (𝑎𝑔) 𝑁 ; 𝐹𝑜 = (cid:205)𝑎 𝐴{𝑎 𝑓 ,𝑎𝑔 } 𝑁𝑇 (𝑎) 𝑁 , with 𝑁 = 𝑁𝑇 (𝑎). (3) 𝑎 𝐴 Note that there can be an overlap between greedy and frequent actions. In these (rare) cases, the greedy action category is dominant, i.e., we categorize the action as greedy even if it would also be the frequent action. This implies that the actions classified as frequent in Figure 4, are always suboptimal/bad compared to the respective greedy action. Consequently, high 𝐹 𝑓 indicates that the model prefers the most frequent action even when observing better action in the context. (a) Action Strategies (b) Corrleations Figure 18 Effect of RLFT on frequency bias for 2B (10 arms, medium noise). Post RLFT. In Section 4.3, we observed that RLFT counteracts frequency bias. In addition to frequency buckets reported in Figure 18a, we provide the plot frequency against action entropy post RLFT in Figure 18b. Compared to Figure 4a, we observe that after RLFT the models maintains higher action entropy for longer. Only at high repetition frequencies the action entropy decreases severely. Consequently, RLFT counteracts frequency bias, but does not completely alleviate it. C.1.3. Knowing-Doing Gap The knowing-doing gap has been observed by Paglieri et al. (2024) and Ruoss et al. (2024). It states that models possess knowledge about task or consequences of their behavior (i.e., they know what to do), but cannot materialize this knowledge when acting (i.e., they are incapable of doing). We illustrate the knowing-doing gap empirically in Figure 5. To this end, we first task Gemma2 27B to produce the UCB algorithm and to compute the relevant quantities required to act according to UCB (knowing). This involves counting how often every action was selected, computing the mean rewards for every action, and computing the final UCB values. After producing the quantities, the model is tasked to act according to them (i.e., doing). In Figure 22, we present and example of the respective instructions given to the model along with response produced by Gemma2 27B. To evaluate performance empirically, we let Gemma2 27B interact with the environment (64 parallel instances) for 50 timesteps. We extend the token generation budget to 2048 tokens per step, to accommodate the additional required computations. Every produced action 𝑧 contains both the CoT rationale 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 and the final selected action 𝑎. We first extract the computed UCB values from the produced rationale 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 . To achieve this, we task Gemma2 27B to enclose the computed values by <ucb_values> and </ucb_values> blocks. Then we extract the selected action 𝑎 and execute it in the environment. For this experiment, we use Gemma2 27B, because we found that 2B and 9B struggled with computing the relevant UCB quantities and with enclosing them appropriately under the desired blocks. Quantifying Knowing. To quantify knowing, we compare the UCB values computed by the model and extracted from 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 against the real UCB values. To this end, we recompute the real UCB 28 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities values for every action at every time-step given the observed history. We consider the rationale as correct if the arm with the highest UCB values match. We opt for this choice rather than checking for exact equality, because we observed that the model struggles with exact calculations for complex operations. This is expected, because the necessary computations involve logarithm and square roots of floating point values. While tool use (e.g., calculator) could mitigate this issue, we observed that Gemma2 27B gets the quantities approximately right, resulting in valid rationales. Thus, the fraction of correct rationales is 𝐹𝑐 = 1 𝐶𝑜𝑇 ) given classifier 𝑔. 𝑁 Quantifying Doing. To quantify doing, we categorize the generated actions as optimal action if the model selects the action with the highest UCB value, as greedy if it selects the action with the highest UCB value among the set of actions tried so far, and as other if the action is neither optimal nor greedy. It is possible that the greedy action is the optimal action. However, in this case the action is considered optimal instead of greedy. Subsequently, we compute the percentages of greedy/optimal/other actions (e.g., 𝐹𝑔 100). We find that the model clearly knows how to solve the task, with 89% of all rationales being correct (see Figure 5). 𝑔(𝑧𝑖 (cid:205)𝑁 𝑖=1 C.2. Multi-armed Bandits In Figure 6, we report the cumulative regrets across model sizes and arms for medium noise (𝜎 = 1.0) scenario. In addition, we repeat the same experiment in the low-noise (𝜎 = 0.1) and the high-noise 𝜎 = 3.0 setting in Figure 19. For both noise levels, we observe similar trends as for the medium noise setting. In particular, we observe that LLMs clearly outperform the random baseline and RLFT lowers the cumulative regret for Gemma2 2B across all arm scenarios. (a) High Noise (𝜎 = 3) (b) Low Noise (𝜎 = 0.1) Figure 19 Main Comparison on Gaussian MABs button scenario in the (a) high 𝜎 = 3 and (a) low 𝜎 = 0.1 noise settings. We compare cumulative regrets (lower is better) of classic baselines against ICL and RLFT performances for Gemma2 2/9/27B for 5, 10, and 20 arms. 29 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities C.3. Contextual Bandits We repeat the same fine-tuning experiment for the contextual MovieLens bandits described in Section A.2. In Figure 20, we report the cumulative regrets attained by Gemma2B across different model sizes and for 5, 10 and 20 arms. Furthermore, we compare against LinearUCB and Random baseline. Overall, we observe similar performance improvements for RLFT on CBs as on MABs. While the ICL performances barely attain the same performance as Random agent, RLFT fine-tuned Gemma2 2B perform similar to UCB.

Ablations Finally, we provide additional details on the ablations conducted in this work. D.1. Tic-tac-toe: Effect of Legal Actions in State By default, we provided the legal actions available at the current turn within the input context to the agent. We found this design choice to be essential for effective fine-tuning compared to training without legal actions (see Figure 9b). Without legal actions in the context the average return drops from 0.75 (w/ legal actions) to 0.45. This suggests that the LLM fails at identifying the appropriate actions among the set of all possible actions when not given legal actions at the current state. In contrast, when provided with sufficient information (i.e., legal actions), the LLM is able to select actions appropriately (similar to Section 4.4). Providing the legal actions in the agents context alleviates the need to explore/identify invalid actions. Consequently, this shortcoming further highlights the need for principled exploration strategies for LLMs in decision-making scenarios. Figure 21 Effect of removing legal actions from the context in Tic-tac-toe. 30 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities D.2. Removing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) For our results without CoT reported in Figure 9b, we remove the CoT instructions given to our agents. Instead, we instruct the agents to not perform any reasoning steps and to only produce the action to execute in the environment 𝑎. In addition, we limit the token generation budget 𝐺 to 16 to avoid that the model ignores the instructions and makes use of the additional tokens. Furthermore, this considerably speeds up training due faster rollout times and shorter context lengths. D.3. Expert Behavior Cloning vs. Thought Cloning prevalent approach in sequence models for decision-making is behavior cloning (BC) (Brohan et al., 2022, 2023; Pomerleau, 1988; Reed et al., 2022), which relies on expert datasets. Consequently, we construct two UCB expert dataset comprising 32K rollouts either w/o CoT (behavior cloning) or w/ CoT (thought cloning), as described in Appendix A.1. Notably, both SFT variants successfully mimic the expert achieving comparable regret to the UCB expert (see Figure 9b, SFT). This result underscores the efficacy of training on expert data in decision-making scenarios when available, echoing recent findings in reasoning tasks (Muennighoff et al., 2025). While BC and TC attain similar performance levels on the simplistic MABs, we anticipate that TC is advantageous in more complex decision-making scenarios as found by Hu and Clune (2023). D.4. Thinking Time We investigate the effect of giving the agent more time to think in Figure 9c. To achieve this, we vary the maximal number of tokens that the agent can generate per action 𝐺 {16, 64, 256, 512}. By default, we set 𝐺 to 256. Indeed, we observe that the performance improves consistently with more thinking tokens. Decreasing 𝐺 to 16 or 64 results in poor performance, because the agent is unable to rationalize its decisions within the restricted generation budget. This is similar to the performance without CoT, but in contrast, the agent is instructed to produce the reasoning process. Over the course of RLFT, the agents learn to produce short rationales 𝑧𝐶𝑜𝑇 , including the action 𝑎 due to our reward shaping mechanism (see Section 3.2). However, the produced short rationales are unhelpful to improving agent performance. In contrast, doubling 𝐺 from 256 to 512 results in considerable performance increase to the level of Gemma2 9B with RLFT (see Figure 6). We observe an increase in the average sequence length over the course of the RLFT process. This suggests that the agent learns to effectively leverage the additional thinking time and reflects recent observations in mathematical reasoning (Guo et al., 2025). However, the increased performance comes with additional training cost due to the multistep nature of decision-making scenarios. In fact, we observed that rollout generation can make up the majority of the training time required by the RLFT process. This is because the agent has to produce more tokens at every environment interaction step. For example, for our default horizon of 50 timesteps and generation budget of 500, the agent produces 25K tokens (at maximum). 31 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Instructions for Gemma2 27B as UCB agent [Instructions] Your task is to act according to the Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) algorithm. First, write down the UCB algorithm. Then compute the relevant UCB values for every button (approximate if necessary). Finally, select your action according to the computed quantities. [More Instructions] So far you have tried/seen: Step=0 Action=blue Reward=1.06 Step=1 Action=blue Reward=1.82 Step=2 Action=green Reward=1.0 Step=3 Action=green Reward=-0.26 Step=4 Action=blue Reward=-0.58 Step=5 Action=blue Reward=-0.34 Step=6 Action=green Reward=1.19 Step=7 Action=green Reward=2.21 Step=8 Action=green Reward=0.07 Step=9 Action=green Reward=1.45 Step=10 Action=green Reward=-0.11 What do you predict next? Generated response by Gemma2 27B Heres how Id approach this as UCB bandit algorithm: UCB Algorithm (Short Version) Initialization: For each button, set count (number of times pressed) to 0 and an estimated reward average to 0. Iteration: For each button, calculate the UCB value: 𝑈𝐶 𝐵 = average_reward + 2ln(total_steps) button_count Choose the button with the highest UCB value. Update the buttons count and average reward based on the observed reward. UCB Calculations (Approximate) Lets denote the buttons by their colors. Heres breakdown after 10 steps: blue: Count = 4 Average Reward = (1.06 + 1.82 - 0.58 - 0.34) / 4 = 0.49 UCB 0.49 + green: 2ln(11) 1.17 Count = 7 Average Reward = (1.0 + -0.26 + 1.19 + 2.21 + 0.07 + 1.45 - 0.11) / 7 0.92 UCB 0.92 + 2ln(11) 7 1.47 Other buttons: Count = 0, Average Reward = 0, UCB = 2ln(11) 0 = (Well explore these later) Action Selection: The button with the highest UCB value is green. Therefore, ACTION=green Explanation: The UCB algorithm balances exploration (trying buttons we havent seen much) and exploitation (choosing buttons that seem to have high rewards). Green has higher average reward than blue, but blue has been explored less. The UCB formula takes this into account, giving higher value to green because its average reward is more reliable due to more observations. The other buttons have infinite UCB values because we havent tried them yet, so they are highly prioritized for exploration. However, greens current UCB is high enough to warrant another try.
