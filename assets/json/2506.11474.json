            "content": "Clinical decision making (CDM) is complex, multi-step process involving the assessment of patient symptoms, retrieval of relevant clinical evidence, and formulation of diagnostic and treatment strategies. Unlike simple factual recall, CDM requires integrating diverse clinical findings and dynamically refining hypotheses as new information becomes available. Effective CDM entails not only selecting the most probable differential diagnoses but also determining what additional information * Equal contribution. Corresponding authors. is needed to reduce uncertainty and guide the next best diagnostic and therapeutic steps in patients clinical trajectory (Moor et al., 2023a). While CDM spans broad sequence of clinical decisions, core subcomponent is the step-by-step reasoning that underlies each decision point. This sequential structure makes CDM reasoning wellsuited to process reward modeling (PRM) (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Setlur et al., 2024), which evaluates and rewards intermediate steps of process rather than solely its final outcome. In medical practice, sound intermediate reasoning is critical to ensuring safety, reliability, and adherence to the standard of care. This creates strong clinical motivation for models that support stepwise verification and feedback. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance in medical applications through pre-training (Chen et al., 2023; Moor et al., 2023b), post-training (Kim et al., 2025), retrieval (Zakka et al., 2024; Jeong et al., 2024; Sohn et al., 2025), tool augmentation, and agentic systems (Tang et al., 2024; Schmidgall et al., 2024). More recently, emerging reasoning models (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) have demonstrated the ability to decompose complex tasks into interpretable steps and exhibit metacognitive skills such as planning and error correction. However, such abilities are underexplored in clinical domains, where transparency, robustness, and alignment with medical standards are critical for delivering high-quality care. Despite PRMs potential for medical reasoning, its application to the medical domain poses key challenges. Chief among these is the need for high-quality, step-level supervision, which is both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Early studies (Lightman et al., 2023) relied on human annotation, which is not scalable (Setlur et al., 2024). More recent works employed automatic labeling strategies such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Wang et al., 2024b), which estimate the quality of reasoning step quality based on the probability of reaching the correct final answer from that step. Notably, MedS3 (Jiang et al., 2025), domain-specific PRM for clinical QA, also adopts an MCTS-based approach. However, these strategies often undervalue early reasoning steps that are logically sound but fail to lead to the correct outcome. This limitation is especially problematic as penalizing valid early steps can distort the learning signal and ultimately hinder the models ability to evaluate intermediate reasoning accurately. Second, medical reasoning requires extensive domain knowledge that may not be fully captured within language models parameters alone. Thus, it necessitates robust method to incorporate medical knowledge to generate factual, evidence-based outcomes and prevent hallucinations. In particular, training reward models solely on labels without medical context is insufficient for learning the rationale behind those labels. To overcome this, it is essential to provide relevant medical information, such as clinical guidelines, during training, enabling more accurate interpretation of stepwise reward signals grounded in medical reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose MedPRM, retrieval-augmented process reward modeling framework for clinical reasoning. Our method employs RAG-AS-A-JUDGE approach to perform stepwise evaluation conditioned on both the clinical question and retrieved medical documents. This retrieval-augmented evaluation aligns more closely with expert physician annotations than sampling-based auto-labeling methods used during training. By incorporating relevant clinical knowledge at both the training and inference stages, MedPRM enables more accurate assessment of intermediate reasoning and outperforms existing PRM baselines by an average of 3.44% across seven medical benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that test-time scaling, where Med-PRM is used as verifier alongside fine-tuned policy model, achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, Med-PRM exhibits strong plug-and-play generality: when applied to topperforming models such as UltraMedical (Zhang et al., 2024b), which is trained on data costing approximately $20,000, our reward model, trained on curated dataset costing less than $20, further achieves superior performance, highlighting the cost-efficiency and scalability of our approach. Our contributions are as follows: 1. We propose Med-PRM, retrieval-augmented process reward modeling framework that evaluates each reasoning step in the context of both the clinical question and retrieved evidence, enabling fine-grained and evidencegrounded assessment. 2. We demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves stateof-the-art performance across six out of seven medical QA benchmarks, outperforming all baseline language, reasoning, and medical models. Our verifier improves base model performance by up to 13.50% at test time and reaches 80.35% on MedQA (4 options) using only 8B-parameter models. 3. Through in-depth qualitative analysis and collaboration with medical experts, we show that Med-PRM closely aligns with clinical experts, addressing key limitations of prior training methods of PRMs in both logical consistency and factual accuracy."

            "content": "For more detailed overview of related work, refer to Appendix E. LLMs have shown increasing proficiency in medical reasoning, effectively handling domain-specific terminology and multimodal data. Using corpora like PubMed, MIMIC-III/IV (Johnson et al., 2023), and UMLS, recent models go beyond surface-level recall to complex inference. Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2023a) demonstrates promising performance on expert-level medical QA benchmarks, while methods such as CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2025), agentic frameworks (Kim et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Schmidgall et al., 2024), and PRM (Jiang et al., 2025) further enhance reasoning. Reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2024b) and verifier feedback (Chen et al., 2024) have been applied to refine reasoning traces, emphasizing the need for stepwise supervision. MedS3(Jiang et al., 2025) applies PRM using MCTS-based auto-labeling. Our approach, MedPRM, also leverages process-level rewards but differs by incorporating retrieval-augmented generation and an LLM-as-a-Judge framework. As shown in Section 6 and Section 7, this yields superior performance compared to MCTS-based methods. Hao et al. (2024) explore the use of LLMs as verifiers for CoT reasoning. Med-PRM adopts RAGAS-A-JUDGE for stepwise supervision, diverging from earlier PRM approaches that rely on automatic scoring. In mathematics, RAG-PRM (Zhu et al., 2025) has been proposed to retrieve similar QA pairs for few-shot prompting with PRM. In contrast, Med-PRM retrieves medical knowledge and evidence, enabling integration of diverse sources like textbooks or clinical guidelines."

            "title": "3.1 Reward Model",
            "content": "Reward models have emerged as central to advancing LLMs beyond pre-training and fine-tuning, driven by two key developments in reinforcement learning (RL) and test-time compute scaling. RL methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely on reward functions to optimize model behavior in settings where ground-truth supervision is sparse or costly. Additionally, test-time strategies like best-of-N (Lightman et al., 2023) have proven effective as alternatives to majority voting, such as self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023), using reward models to rank and select high-quality outputs. These trends highlight the growing importance of accurate, context-aware reward models not only during training but also at inference time. Outcome Reward Model (ORM) Given question and model-generated reasoning trace the ORM assigns sigmoid score rS [0, 1] indicating the correctness of the entire trace. ORM is trained with the following cross-entropy loss: LORM = (yS log rS + (1 yS) log(1 rS)) , where yS is the gold label of the reasoning trace S, yS = 1 if is correct, and yS = 0 otherwise. Process Reward Model (PRM) Given reasoning trace = (s1, s2, , sK) where is the number of reasoning steps, PRM assigns score rsi [0, 1] for each step si. Gold labels ysi {0, 1} indicate whether each step is correct. To compute these scores, the model predicts logits for the special tokens + (correct) and - (incorrect) appended to each reasoning step. The confidence score rsi is defined as the softmax probability of the + token over the logits of both tokens. The model is trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss over all reasoning steps: PRM takes as input the concatenation of the question and the reasoning trace S, and produces stepwise confidence scores as follows: (rs1, rs2, , rsK ) And the minimum step score is defined as the score of the solution S: RM(q, S) = rS, where rS = min(rs1, rs2, , rsK ) PRM Auto-Labeling Wang et al. (2024b) proposed an auto-labeling method to address the cost of human annotations ysi. Inspired by MCTS, completer model generates subsequent reasoning processes from each partial trace up to step si, producing sequences of the form(cid:8)(si+1,j, , sKj ,j, aj)(cid:9)N j=1, where aj is the final answer of the j-th continuation. Let denote the gold answer to the question q. hard label is assigned to step si as follows: yHE si = (cid:40) 1 0 if such that aj = a, otherwise. soft label is computed as the empirical probability of reaching the correct answer: ySE si ="

However, it is prone to false negativesparticularly in complex questionswhere factually correct and logically coherent intermediate steps are mislabeled as incorrect (or assigned low soft-label scores) simply because none of their sampled continuations lead to the correct final answer. To mitigate false negatives, we incorporate retrievalbased fact-checking into the labeling process, as described in Section 4."

(3) These labeled traces are used to train the Med-PRM reward model. (4) Med-PRM reward model is used for inference-time evaluation or further train the policy model. These labels yRAG are plugged in LPRM in order to train our PRM. Each score rsi reflects the likelihood that step si is correct, following Lightman et al. (2023). During both training and evaluation, PRM receives the same input: question q, retrieved documents D, and reasoning trace S. The key difference from prior PRM models is the inclusion of the retrieved documents as part of the input. RM(D, q, S) = rS To construct the retrieval query, we concatenate the question with the reasoning trace: = Retriever(q, S) During training, the correct reasoning trace among multiple inferences is used as the query. During inference, randomly sampled reasoning trace is used as the query instead. Further implementation details of document retrieval are provided in Appendix B. = {S1, S2, , SN } be the set of reasoning traces and {aS1, aS2, , aSN } the corresponding answers. Then, we have arm = aS, where = arg max Sj rSj , and where rSj is final score of reasoning trace Sj We also adopt hybrid method following Li et al. (2023) that combines self-consistency and reward scoring, noted as SC+RM (Self-Consistency + Reward Model). Traces are grouped by their final answers, and the answer with the highest total reward is selected: asc+rm = arg max (cid:88) j= I(aSj = a) RM(q, Sj), where RM(q, Sj) is the reward score of the j-th reasoning trace assigned by PRM for question q. strong reward model improves selection by assigning higher scores to correct reasoning traces.

More details on the hyperparameters used are described in Appendix C. Data Filtering and Labeling Training uses MedQA (Jin et al., 2020), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), and MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021). We use the full MedQA training set (10,178 questions) and sample 500 instances from each of the remaining datasets. For each question, we sample 16 candidate reasoning traces and filter out traces with fewer than three or more than nine reasoning steps to avoid overly shallow or degenerate reasoning. To maintain label balance, the number of correct reasoning traces per question was limited to no more than the number of incorrect traces or two, whichever is greater. To ensure the total number of tokens to not exceed 4096, 1024 tokens were reserved for the question and reasoning, and the remaining 3072 tokens were used to sequentially include relevant documents.

This policy model, denoted as Med-PRM Ï, leverages high-quality reasoning traces selected by MedPRM and achieves 79.18% accuracy on MedQA with 10.39% improvement over the base Llama3.1-8B-Instruct model alone. Moreover, when Med-PRM is used as verifier on top of strong, fine-tuned models such as Meerkat-8B and UltraMedical-8B, we observe additional gains. Notably, pairing Med-PRM with Meerkat-8B yields 80.35% accuracy on MedQA, marking the first time that an 8B-scale model has surpassed the 80% threshold on this benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability of our reward model as plug-and-play component for enabling more accurate medical reasoning across diverse models. comprehensive table of full benchmark results, including CoT, SC, and PRM baselines (hard label, soft label, MedS3, and MedPRM) is provided in Appendix J."

First, we replace conventional labeling with using an LLM to directly evaluate the reasoning steps. This is used to train variant named Med-PRM without RAG. Second, we incorporate retrieval for the full MedPRM framework. Results show that each component yields consistent gains across both test-time strategies. Notably, Med-PRM without retrieval already outperforms conventional PRMs, and adding retrieval further boosts performance. This demonstrates the critical role of grounding in external knowledge."

For each question, five model-generated reasoning traces were annotated by human experts, resulting in 180 step-level annotations in total. As shown in Table 3, Med-PRM shows high correlation with human judgments across both easy and hard subsets (0.74 and 0.71, respectively). In Table 3: Pearson correlation between model-generated labels and human annotations on reasoning steps for easy and hard subsets. contrast, the performance of soft and hard labeling strategies drops significantly on hard examples, dropping from 0.64 to 0.34 and 0.70 to 0.31, respectively.

Med-PRM assigns more appropriate and clinically grounded rewards than conventional PRM by leveraging evidence from retrieved documents, enabling more accurate evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps. and conjunctival injection are characteristic only of autoimmune orbitopathy in Graves disease. This distinction is key to differentiating the incorrect choice (E) from the correct one (C). Leveraging this evidence, Med-PRM assigns step-level labels of 1 to Step 1 and Step 2, and 0 to Step 5 and Step 6, aligning exactly with expert annotations. In contrast, the ORM data labeling pipeline assigns an overall incorrect label to the entire reasoning trace, as it only considers the final answer, missing the valid reasoning steps in Steps 1 and 2. Similarly, the conventional PRM data labeling pipeline assigns low scores to Steps 1 and 2, incorrectly marking them as poor reasoning, since the final answer derived from these steps is incorrect. As result, both ORM and PRM fail to correctly evaluate the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, mislabeling valid reasoning as low quality. Test-Time Labeling Figure 5 presents an example from the MedQA dataset concerning patient suspected of polyhydramnios. Duodenal atresia can cause polyhydramnios, while posterior urethral valve (PUV) typically leads to oligohydramnios. Steps 1 to 4 of the reasoning trace appropriately integrate the patients clinical findings to analyze the polyhydramnios context. However, in Step 5, the model incorrectly reasons that posterior uretheral valve can cause polyhydramnios, ultimately leading to an incorrect answer in Step 6. The retrieved document explicitly states that PUV leads to oligohydramnios due to urinary outflow obstruction. This serves as clear rationale for why the incorrect answer choice (D) is invalid. Conventional PRM models assign relatively high rewards to Step 5 and Step 6 in the absence of helpful external documents. In contrast, Med-PRM uses the retrieved document to detect the error more precisely, providing high rewards up to Step 4 and then sharply reducing rewards from Step 5 onward. These examples show that Med-PRM can identify and localize errors in medical reasoning steps more effectively than auto-labeling trained PRM, highlighting the value of document-grounded, stepwise evaluation in capturing nuanced reasoning quality by referring to relevant clinical documents."

Med-PRM addresses key limitations of existing PRMs by verifying intermediate reasoning steps against retrieved medical documents rather than relying on outcome-based autolabeling. Our experiments show that Med-PRM consistently outperforms prior methods across both multiple-choice and open-ended clinical benchmarks, with notable gains in complex diagnostic tasks. Furthermore, the retrieval-based step verification produces scalable, expert-aligned labels that support effective policy training and verifier in test-time scaling. Together, these contributions establish Med-PRM as robust and generalizable approach for improving the accuracy, transparency, and trustworthiness of medical AI systems."

First, our evaluation is currently confined to the medical domain, though the methodology could potentially generalize to other domains requiring stepwise reasoning verification and retrieval-augmented generation. Second, due to computational constraints, we limited our experiments to small language models like Llama 3.1 8B and Meerkat 8B, though there remains significant potential to explore scalability across different model architectures and sizes Third, while our reward model demonstrates strong performance, we did not extensively explore diverse reinforcement learning methods that could further enhance our methods capabilities. Future work should investigate these aspects through broader domain coverage, model scaling experiments, and more sophisticated reinforcement learning training strategies."

            "content": "Medical Reasoning Large language models (LLMs) have shown growing competence in medical reasoning, which presents unique challenges beyond general language tasks, including specialized terminology, multimodal patient data, and high demands for factual accuracy. Leveraging biomedical corpora such as PubMed, MIMIC-III/IV (Johnson et al., 2023), and UMLS, recent models have progressed from surface-level recall to more complex diagnostic and therapeutic inference. Pioneered by Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2023a), demonstrates strong performance on expert-level medical questions. Advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and training (Wei et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2025), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Zakka et al., 2024; Sohn et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025), agentic systems (Kim et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Schmidgall et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2025) further extend this paradigm by orchestrating multiple specialized agents to collaboratively solve complex clinical tasks. PRM (Lightman et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2025), and Reinforcement Learning (Wang et al., 2024b) have enabled LLMs to generate structured reasoning traces. Similarly, HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen et al., 2024) incorporates verifier feedback to iteratively refine multi-step reasoning traces. These trends highlight the growing importance of process reward mechanisms. Like mathematical problem solving, clinical reasoning often requires multi-step inference, where single incorrect step can invalidate the final outcome. Thus, stepwise supervision is not only applicable to medicine but also critical for ensuring transparency and reliability in clinical decision-making. PRM in Medical Domain recent study has been made to apply PRM in the medical domain. MedS3 (Jiang et al., 2025) constructs PRM training dataset with similar approaches to existing PRM frameworks, using MCTS-based autolabeling. Med-PRM also provides process rewards for medical reasoning, but mainly differs in the way of constructing the training set, leveraging retrievalaugmented generation and LLM-as-a-Judge. Section 6 and Section 7 show that our approach is more effective than MCTS-based methods. LLM-as-a-Judge for Reasoning Evaluation Recent research actively explores the use of LLMas-a-Judge as PRM or as Process Explanation Model (PEM). In Hao et al. (2024), LLMs are employed to evaluate the quality of Chain-ofThought (CoT) reasoning. Med-PRM uses RAGAS-A-JUDGE as labeling strategy for reasoning steps, which differs in terms of how it is utilized, and this also contrasts with the automatic labeling approaches used in prior PRM research. Retrieval-Augmented PRM in Mathematics In the mathematical domain, recent work has explored combining retrieval with PRM (Zhu et al., 2025). RAG-PRM retrieves semantically similar sets of questions and answers to enable PRM to generalize against out-of-distribution questions. While both Med-PRM approaches incorporate retrieval, Med-PRM differs in that it retrieves medical evidence and knowledge rather than similar QA pairs for few-shot-style prompting. Moreover, our retrieval method supports scalable integration, ranging from curated sources such as medical textbooks and clinical guidelines to potentially broader corpora like PubMed in other deployments."

            "content": "Below are detailed descriptions of the medical benchmark datasets used in our study. MedQA MedQA is comprehensive medical question answering dataset derived from professional medical board examinations. The dataset spans three languages: English, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese. Our work focuses exclusively on the English subset, which contains 12,730 questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). Our method was evaluated on questions with both four and five options. MedQA evaluates diverse aspects of medical knowledge, encompassing diagnostic procedures, treatment protocols, and fundamental medical concepts. The questions are designed to test both factual medical knowledge and clinical reasoning capabilities. MedMCQA MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022) is an extensive multiple-choice dataset comprising over 194,000 high-quality questions from Indian medical entrance examinations (AIIMS and NEET PG). Our evaluation incorporates 500 questions from this dataset, with an average token length of 12.77 tokens per question. Each question presents four answer choices. The dataset demonstrates remarkable topical diversity, covering 2,400+ healthcare topics across 21 medical subjects. MedMCQAs comprehensive coverage and focus on entrance exam questions make it particularly valuable for assessing both theoretical knowledge and practical clinical reasoning abilities in medical problem-solving scenarios. MMLU (Medical Subset) The Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021) contains specialized medical knowledge subsets that we incorporate into our evaluation. Our benchmark utilizes 1,089 medical-related questions from MMLU. Each question presents four multiple-choice options. The medical subsets encompass diverse domains including anatomy, clinical knowledge, college medicine, medical genetics, and professional medicine. MMLUs comprehensive coverage spans both fundamental and advanced medical concepts, testing knowledge across wide spectrum of difficulty levels from basic to professional expertise. The benchmarks standardized assessment format enables meaningful comparisons between medical reasoning capabilities and other knowledge domains. DDXPlus DDXPlus (Tchango et al., 2022) is large-scale synthetic dataset containing approximately 1.3 million patient cases, designed to advance research in Automatic Symptom Detection (ASD) and Automatic Diagnosis (AD) systems. Unlike traditional medical datasets that only include binary symptoms and antecedents, DDXPlus incorporates categorical and multi-choice symptoms, along with hierarchical symptom organization. Each case includes comprehensive information such as differential diagnoses, ground truth pathologies, symptoms, and relevant antecedents. This dataset enables the development of more sophisticated medical reasoning systems that can interact with patients in logical manner and provide differential diagnoses, which is crucial for helping doctors understand the reasoning process of AI systems. AgentClinic* AgentClinic (Schmidgall et al., 2024) is multimodal agent benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in simulated clinical environments. Unlike traditional static question answering benchmarks, AgentClinic captures the complex, sequential nature of clinical decision making by integrating diverse clinical findings derived from patient interactions, multimodal data collection, and tool usage. The benchmark spans nine medical specialties and seven languages, providing comprehensive evaluation framework. Notably, when MedQA problems are presented in AgentClinics sequential decision making format, diagnostic accuracies can drop significantly compared to traditional formats. The benchmark enables novel patient-centric metrics and supports various tools including experiential learning, adaptive retrieval, and reflection cycles. AgentClinics interactive environment allows for in-depth evaluation of clinical reasoning capabilities through real-world electronic health records and clinical reader studies. In this work, we adopt simplified variant of the benchmark, referred to as AgentClinic*, which reformulates the task into single step inference problem. This adaptation is motivated by practical considerations: conducting multiple reasoning steps would incur excessive API calls and computational overhead in large-scale experiments. Moreover, techniques like self-consistency, which are important for evaluating model reliability, are less applicable in multi-turn settings due to nondeterministic agent trajectories. AgentClinic* thus strikes balance between realism and tractability while preserving the core challenge of evidencegrounded clinical reasoning. Training We train our model using four widely adopted medical datasets: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU-Med. For MedQA, we utilize the entire training set comprising 10,178 questions. For the remaining three datasets, we randomly sampled 500 examples from each training set to construct lightweight yet diverse training corpus, encompassing variety of question formats and clinical topics. This setup ensured data efficiency while enabling the model to learn from broad range of medical problem types. Evaluation Model performance was evaluated on MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six medical-related subsets of MMLU (Anatomy, Clinical Knowledge, College Biology, College Medicine, Medical Genetics, and Professional Medicine). Additionally, we conducted out-ofdomain evaluations that required more complex clinical reasoning. These included DDXPlus and two variants of AgentClinic based on NEJM case reports and MedQA. For DDXPlus, we randomly sampled 500 examples due to its extensive size, and reformulated the task to focus on differential diagnosis by providing supporting evidence and requiring the model to select the correct disease from list of up to five candidates. AgentClinic, in contrast, presented an open-ended question-answering format without predefined answer choices, simulating real-world clinical scenarios through the analysis of diverse clinical findings (multi-turn dialogues were not included). To evaluate responses in open-ended settings, we adopted an LLM-as-ajudge framework (Gemini-2.0-flash), following similar approach to HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen et al., 2024)."
