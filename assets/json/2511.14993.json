            "content": "Over the past few years, diffusion models [1, 2] and the subsequent flow matching approaches [3] have led to qualitative breakthrough in image generation, achieving This foundation enabled the rapid develunprecedented synthesis quality and diversity. opment of commercial and open-source systems that provide users with wide range of generative capabilities, from text-to-image (T2I) synthesis to complex editing [4, 5, 6, 7]. To date, image generation models have not only achieved high quality but continue to improve actively, constantly raising the bar for realism and controllability, as demonstrated by models such as Stable Diffusion 3 [8], Flux [9], Seedream 3 & 4 [10, 11], and Hunyuan Image 3 [12]. natural extension of this progress has been the growing interest in video generation, leading to numerous methods that adapt and extend architectures proven successful for images [13, 14, 15, 16]. However, the direct translation of these approaches faced fundamental scalability issues due to the exponential growth in computational complexity when working with time-dependent three-dimensional video data. Partial resolution of these limitations was achieved through the active adoption of architectures like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) [17], which provided the necessary scalability and efficiency [18, 19], along with series of modifications to attention mechanisms aimed at handling video data [20, 21, 22]. Today, number of video generation models demonstrate high level of quality, such as Sora [23, 24] and Veo [25]. significant part of this progress is driven by open-source initiatives. Projects such as HunyuanVideo [26], Mochi [27], CogVideoX [28], Wan [29] and VACE [30], democratize access to foundational architectures and pre-trained weights, accelerating research and development, and demonstrating results close to professional-grade video production. All this opens up broad opportunities for the application of video models and lays the groundwork for creating multimedia generation systems [31], world models [32], and foundational visual models, analogous in their significance to Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [33, 34, 35]. Despite the rapid development, critical challenges persist in video generation. Beyond processing vast amounts of data, creating such systems requires complex, multi-stage optimizations for both the training process and subsequent inference. Therefore, the efficient creation of high-quality, consistent, and controllable video remains one of the most challenging tasks in generative AI. In this work, we aim to address some of the key challenges in the field of video generation. We present Kandinsky 5.0 family of fundamental generative models for high-resolution image and video synthesis, designed to achieve state-of-the-art quality and operational efficiency. The Kandinsky 5.0 suite comprises three line-up of models: Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro: high-power 19B parameter models for text-to-video and image-to-video generation, creating up to 10-second videos at high resolution . Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite: lightweight 2B parameter model for text-to-video and imageto-video generation, producing up to 10-second clips. Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite: 6B parameter models for text-to-image generation and image editing at high resolution. Figure 1: Kandinsky 5.0 Models Family The key contributions of this technical report are as follows: 1. We provide comprehensive description of the data collection and processing pipeline, including data preparation for instructive image editing tuning and self-supervised finetuning (SFT) for both video and image modalities. 2. We detail the multi-stage training pipeline for all six models, encompassing pretraining phase for learning general patterns of the visual world and SFT for enhancing visual quality. We also introduce our RLHF post-training adversarial method based on comparing generated images with those from the SFT dataset. This approach achieves superior realism, visual quality, and prompt alignment. 3. We present the architecture of our core CrossDiT model, featuring our key optimization of the attention mechanism for high-resolution video (exceeding 512 px) with durations longer than 5 seconds via the NABLA method [36]. This overcomes the quadratic complexity of standard spatio-temporal attention, achieving 2.7 reduction in training and inference time with 90% sparsity ratio while maintaining generated video quality, as confirmed by FVD [37], VBench [38], CLIP-score [39] and human evaluation through side-byside testing. 4. We describe multiple optimizations implemented across the pipeline to accelerate inference, training, and reduce memory consumption. These techniques include variational autoencoder (VAE) optimization, text encoder quantization, and CrossDiT training optimizations using Fully or Hybrid Sharded Data Parallel (F/HSDP) [40], activation checkpointing [41], among others. 5. For video model distillation, we employ combined approach that integrates ClassifierFree Guidance Distillation [42], Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation (TSCD) [43], and subsequent adversarial post-training [44] to enhance visual quality. This reduces the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) from 100 to 16 while preserving visual quality, as evidenced by side-by-side human evaluation results. 6. We evaluate our final models against several state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate superior video generation quality through human evaluation on prompt set from MovieGen [45]. 7. Finally, we open-source the code and weights for all models from various training stages, and provide access through the diffusers library."

            "content": "Figure 2: The evolution of Kandinsky models. The Kandinsky family of visual generative models, named after Russian abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky (1866 1944), has evolved significantly since its inception (Figure 2). Its history began in June 2022 with the release of Kandinsky 1.0, 12B-parameter model. This model was an enlarged version of the earlier Malevich1,2 model (aka ruDALL-E XL), which had 1.3B parameters, was inspired by DALL-E [46], and was released in November 2021. Compared to Malevich model, Kandinsky 1.0 featured more layers, increased hidden space, and was trained on 120 million text-image pairs. Both models utilized an autoregressive architecture to generate 256256 resolution images. radical shift occurred in November 2022 with Kandinsky 2.03,4 [47], the familys first diffusion model. To ensure multilingual capability, it employed two encoders XLMR-clip [48] and mT5-small [49] enabling support for queries in 101 languages. Trained on one billion text-image pairs, the 2B-parameter model could generate images at 512512 resolution. The next stage, Kandinsky 2.15 (April 2023), brought major architectural improvements: 1https://github.com/ai-forever/ru-dalle 2https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/rudalle-Malevich 3https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2 4https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/Kandinsky_2.0 5https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/Kandinsky_2.1 single XLM-Roberta-Large-Vit-L-146 text encoder, MoVQ image autoencoder [50], and the addition of an image prior model for better text-image alignment. The diffusion mechanism was refined to use CLIP visual embeddings [51]. After fine-tuning on an additional 170 million text-image pairs, the model surpassed DALL-E 2 [52], GigaGAN [53], and Stable Diffusion 2.1 [4] on the FID metric [54] on the COCO 30k dataset [55]. The model has 3.3B parameters, resolution of 768768, and natively supports inpainting, outpainting, image blending, synthesis of variations of an input image, and text-guided image editing. In July 2023, Kandinsky 2.27 (4.8B) further enhanced photorealism and increased resolution to 1024 pixels with support for various aspect ratios. Other innovations included the introduction of ControlNet mechanism [56] for local editing, and the capability to generate 4-second animated clips. November 2023 saw the release of two major models. Kandinsky 3.08,9 (11.9B) [57], which focused on precise text-image alignment, used the FLAN-UL2 language encoder. Released in parallel, Kandinsky Video 1.010 (17.5B) [15] was state-of-the-art, open-source video generation model based on Kandinsky 3.0. It operated in two stages: generating keyframes and then interpolating between them. Generating an 8-second video at 512512 resolution took approximately three minutes, despite the model being trained on only 220,000 text-video pairs. The line-up expanded again in April 2024 with two models. Kandinsky Flash (11.9B) was distilled version of Kandinsky 3.0 that reduced the number of generation steps from 50 to 4 using the Adversarial Diffusion Distillation approach [58]. Kandinsky 3.1 (15.5B) [7] combined Kandinsky 3.0 and Kandinsky Flash, using the latter as refiner on the final steps in the reverse diffusion process, which significantly enhanced visual quality. This version also incorporated improvements to multicultural awareness, particularly for the Russian-culture domain [59, 60]. The model supports image variation, image blending, image-and-text blending, ControlNetbased editing, and inpainting. Additionally, we trained state-of-the-art super-resolution model KandiSuperRes11 on the base Kandinsky 3.0 model. video model update, Kandinsky Video 1.1 [16], followed in May 2024. It used Kandinsky 3.0 for first frame generation and was trained on an enlarged dataset of 4.6 million text-video pairs. The model generates 5.5-second videos, and its dataset preparation leveraged automatic captioning via LLaVA-1.5 [61]. Kandinsky 4.012 (17.5B) was released in December 2024 as the familys first Diffusion Transformer model. Using an MMDiT-like architecture [8], it generates both images and 12-second videos from text and images. In VBench benchmarks [38] and human evaluations, Kandinsky 4.0 demonstrated superior results against models like CogVideoX-1.5 [28], Open-Sora-Plan v1.3 [62], Mochi v1.0 [27], and Pyramid Flow [63]. This version also supported audio generation from an input video clip. Its refinement, Kandinsky 4.1 (14B, June 2025), adopted DiT architecture for image generation and underwent Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage using data manually selected by team of expert artists to enhance aesthetics. The pinnacle of development to date is the Kandinsky 5.013 model family described in this report. This is the first Kandinsky models based on the Flow Matching [3], comprising six models of different sizes for various high-quality image and video generation tasks. 6XLM-Roberta-Large-Vit-L-14 7https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/kandinsky_v22 8https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-3 9https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/kandinsky3 10https://github.com/ai-forever/KandinskyVideo 11https://github.com/ai-forever/KandiSuperRes 12https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-4 13https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-"

These images originate from diverse set of sources, including prominent open datasets (e.g., LAION [64], COYO14) and large online image repositories. meticulous data processing pipeline ensures the datasets quality and suitability for its intended use. Processing Pipeline The processing pipeline for the Kandinsky T2I dataset comprises the following several sequential and filtering stages: Initial Resolution Filtering: Images with shorter side measuring fewer than 256 pixels are discarded. This step ensures baseline level of visual detail. Deduplication: To eliminate redundant content, an image perceptual hash [65] is calculated for each image. This technique identifies and removes exact duplicates and images that are visually very similar. Advanced Filtering: series of models are applied to assess image quality and content, filtering out undesirable data: Watermark Detection: Watermark detection is performed using combination of two models. The system employs the watermark_resnext101_32x8d-large classifier for perceptual analysis alongside YOLO-based detector that locates watermarkImages flagged by either model with confidence score above like objects. defined threshold are filtered out. Quality Assessment: Models predict both technical and aesthetic quality to prioritize visually appealing and well-constructed images: 14https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset 9 Figure 3: Data processing pipeline for Kandinsky T2V (text-to-video) and Kandinsky T2I (textto-image) datasets. The workflow begins with raw image and video data, followed by initial filtering and deduplication it processed through advanced filtering (including watermark detection, quality assessment, complexity and text filtering), classification and content annotation stages. Final processed data is stored grouped by resolution (256, 512, and 1024 minimal side lengths) to use in correspondent pretrain stage. The TOPIQ model [66] provides separate scores for technical quality and aesthetic quality. The Q-Align model [67] offers an alternative assessment of technical and aesthetic aspects. Text Filtering: The CRAFT text detection model [68] identifies regions of text within images. Images containing an excessive amount of text, based on the number of text boxes or the total text area, are excluded to avoid bias towards heavily annotated or subtitle-rich content. Complexity Filtering: Visual complexity is assessed using combined approach where the SAM 2 model [69] generates segmentation masks, complemented by Sobel filter for detailed edge analysis. This pipeline effectively filters out overly simple images (e.g., plain backgrounds) based on quantified complexity metrics. Object and Scene Classification: To enrich metadata and enable conditional generation or analysis, models classify image content: The YOLOv8 model15, trained on OpenImagesV7 [70], detects and classifies ob15https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics Figure 4: Distribution of key data categories across the curated Kandinsky T2I dataset by Location, Main object and Picture style. jects present in the image. CLIP-based classifier [51] categorizes the images location, style, main subject, and detailed place type based on CLIP embeddings. Content Annotation (Synthetic Captions): High-quality synthetic English captions are generated for the images using powerful multimodal models to provide textual descriptions for training: InternVL2-26B [71]: Generates initial detailed captions. Variants of this caption, refined or shortened by the InternLM3-8B model [72], are also included. Qwen2.5VL-32B [73]: Generates Russian captions for higher-resolution images (width height 5122). Post-processing is applied to these synthetic captions to improve their quality and consistency: Regular expressions clean common introductory phrases (e.g., \"The image shows\"). Further filtering removes sentences containing non-English characters (e.g., Cyrillic, Chinese) to maintain language purity in English captions. This mitigates OCR errors from InternVL2, which performs poorly on scripts like Cyrillic (e.g., Russian), ensuring higher quality captions. Organization and Storage: Processed images, along with their metadata, filter scores, and captions, are stored in Parquet files. These files are organized into subdirectories based on shortest image side (256, 512, and 1024) and source dataset name on the specified S3 storage endpoint."

            "content": "The image editing instruct dataset (Kandinsky I2I) was constructed through sophisticated multi-stage pipeline designed to identify high-quality image pairs suitable for editing tasks and to accomplish it with precise text instructions. Processing Pipeline The procedure involved the following steps: 11 Figure 5: Instructive dataset processing pipeline. Initial image data (left) is processed through set of similarity and exclusion criteria including CLIP and DINO embeddings, face similarity, duplicate removal, and custom overlap heuristics to produce filtered image-instruction pairs (right). Each retained image is paired with an Instruct token, forming high-quality instruction-tuned training samples. 1. Initial Image Collection: diverse set of about 240 million images was compiled from various sources, ensuring broad coverage of different visual content, styles, and subjects. 2. Similarity Matching: To identify potential editing pairs, we employed multiple similarity metrics: CLIP Score [51]: Measured semantic similarity between images using CLIP embeddings DINO Score [74]: Computed visual similarity using DINOv2 features Face Recognition: Specifically applied to images containing faces (only single-face images considered) 3. Adaptive Thresholding: Implemented an adaptive thresholding approach for CLIP similarity: Images were clustered into 10,000 groups Thresholds were determined per cluster based on top similarity scores Final threshold: clip_sim > (1 ) clip_thr + where = 0.15 4. Geometric Verification: Potential pairs underwent rigorous geometric verification using LoFTR [75] for feature matching: Extracted feature points and matches between image pairs Applied RANSAC algorithm [76] to estimate fundamental matrix and Euclidean transformation Iteratively identified inlier groups (minimum 20 points per group) Calculated total inliers as the sum of matched points across all valid groups 5. Quality Filtering: Applied multiple filtering criteria to ensure high-quality pairs: DINO inliers: dino_sim > 0.8 AND inliers > 300 CLIP inliers: clip_sim > 0.8 AND inliers > 200 AND adaptive threshold condition 12 Face similarity: face_sim > 0.7 for images containing faces Exclusion criteria: Removed pairs with dino_sim > 0.97 OR dino_aligned_sim > 0.97 OR (face_sim < 0.5 AND face_sim > 0) 6. Aligned DINO Score Calculation: For additional verification: Used LoFTR [75] to find matching points between images Applied RANSAC [76] to find Euclidean transformation Cropped images to overlapping regions Computed DINO similarity [74] on aligned crops (dino_aligned_sim) 7. Overlap Analysis: Filtered out simple crops by ensuring significant transformation between images: Analyzed overlap percentage between images Removed pairs with excessive overlap (indicating simple crops rather than edits) 8. Caption Generation: Finally, for each qualified image pair, we generated descriptive captions that explicitly highlighted the visual transformations to create suitable training data for editing models. Initially, the model was selected through an extensive Sideby-Side (SBS) comparative evaluation of several state-of-the-art multimodal models, including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Mini with reasoning, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL-32B. This qualitative human evaluation assessed the models ability to produce coherent, precise, and instructional captions. Results ranked Gemini 2.5 Pro first, with the GLM 4.5 model [77] achieving competitive results. Given its favorable performance-to-cost ratio, we selected GLM 4.5 without reasoning and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [78] on curated dataset to optimize it specifically for generating instructional captions. This adaptation resulted in robust and cost-effective solution for our task. Dataset Summary This meticulous multi-stage filtering and verification process ensures the creation of an extensive, high-quality dataset comprising approximately 150 million carefully curated image pairs (see Figure 6), each accompanied by comprehensive textual instructions that precisely describe the transformations between images, thereby providing an optimal foundation for effective training of advanced image editing models. However, to further enhance the models aesthetic perception and instruction-following capabilities for final output refinement, we constructed an additional specialized dataset for supervised fine-tuning. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Dataset Curation To create high-quality dataset for supervised fine-tuning, subset was curated from the Kandinsky I2I dataset used for pre-training. We applied quality filters based exclusively on the target image (the second image in the pair), as our observations indicate that this approach is sufficient for identifying high-quality transformation examples while ignoring the source image. The filters required Q-Align score greater than 4 and Q-Align aesthetic score greater than 2 to select visually superior results. This filtering yielded approximately 600k candidate pairs. From this pool, human annotators manually select the most appropriate and highquality image-editing pairs for the final SFT dataset. This meticulous manual curation ensures the SFT training data consists of exemplary instances, which is critical for effective instruction tuning. 13 (a) Instruction: Add second, idetical glove and place it next to the first one, sligtly overlapping it.

            "content": "The Kandinsky T2V dataset comprises more than 250 million video scenes sourced from various open datasets and large video platforms. The data processing pipeline is multi-stage process designed to ensure high-quality, diverse, and suitable data for pretraining the Kandinsky video generation model. Processing Pipeline The procedure involves the following stages: Scene Segmentation: The initial step involves segmenting raw videos into individual scenes using the PySceneDetect tool16, which detects shot changes. This process isolates sequences of consecutive frames with consistent visual perspective. Each extracted scene has duration constrained between 2 and 60 seconds to ensure temporal coherence and manageability for subsequent processing. Initial Filtering and Deduplication: After segmentation, scenes undergo series of initial filtering steps: Resolution Filtering: Scenes with shorter side of fewer than 256 pixels are removed to maintain minimum visual quality standard. Deduplication: To eliminate redundant content, video perceptual hash [79] is computed for each scene. This hash is fingerprint designed to be similar for visually alike videos, allowing for the identification and removal of identical or highly similar scenes. While the primary deduplication uses this method, some duplicates may still persist in the dataset. Advanced Quality and Content Filtering: Following initial filtering, comprehensive suite of models is applied to assess various aspects of scene quality and content: Watermark Detection: Similar to the approach for images, video watermark detection employs combination of dedicated classifier and an object detector. Scenes containing watermarks are filtered out by averaging the models confidence scores across five evenly spaced frames and applying specific thresholds. Structural Dynamics: This filter evaluates scene motion by sampling frames at 2 FPS and calculating the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) index [80] between 16https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect 15 consecutive pairs. low average MS-SSIM score indicates high dynamism (rapid scene changes), while high score indicates static scene. Scenes deemed too static or excessively dynamic are filtered out based on threshold values. Technical and Aesthetic Quality: The DOVER model [81] is employed to provide separate scores for technical quality (e.g., sharpness, noise) and aesthetic quality (e.g., composition, color). An overall quality score is derived as weighted sum of these two components. The Q-Align model [67], which uses large multimodal models to assess visual quality, is also applied to provide an additional quality assessment. Text Detection: The CRAFT model [68] is used to identify text regions within video frames. The number of detected text boxes and their total area are averaged over three evenly spaced frames. Scenes with an excessive amount of text are filtered to prevent the generation of videos dominated by subtitles or on-screen graphics. Object and Scene Classification: The YOLOv8 model, trained on the OpenImagesV7 dataset [70], detects objects in five frames per scene. CLIP-based classifier [51] is used to classify the scenes location, style, main subject, and more detailed place categories by analyzing frame embeddings. Camera and Object Dynamics: specialized model [82] based on VideoMAE [83] architecture was trained to predict scores for camera movement, object movement, and dynamics of light and color changes to further refine the assessment of scene activity. Content Annotation: For scenes that pass the filtering stages, synthetic English captions are generated to provide textual descriptions. This is achieved using the large multimodal model Tarsier2-7B17. To improve caption quality, post-processing steps are applied: Regular expressions are used to remove common introductory phrases (e.g., \"The video starts\"). Captions are filtered to exclude sentences containing non-English characters (e.g., Cyrillic or Chinese), as the models can sometimes produce incorrect or mixed-language output. Additional Processing (Clustering): As an auxiliary process, scene embeddings are generated using the InternVideo2-1B model [84]. K-Means clustering [85] is then performed on these embeddings to group visually or semantically similar scenes into 10,000 clusters. This information is used for balanced sampling and dataset analysis. Organization and Storage: The final processed scenes, along with their metadata, filter scores, and captions, are organized into Parquet files. These files are grouped by the scenes shortest frame side (256, 512, and 1024 - see Table 2 for list of supported resolutions) and stored on an S3-compatible storage endpoint for efficient access during model training."

This dataset is distinct from the large-scale pretraining data, as it consists of smaller set of high-fidelity examples manually selected by expert annotators through rigorous multistage evaluation process. The dataset comprises both images and video content. Additionally, using video language model (VLM), all data was classified into 9 domains (see Figure 8). Moreover, images in SFT dataset were split into more detailed hierarchy of classes to obtain the best possible model. The domain-based organization enables: Domain-specific training approaches and curriculum learning strategies Composition of SFT-soup models by weights averaging (following the approach described in [86]) Figure 8: SFT dataset curation pipeline. Data from Kandinsky T2V and T2I datasets undergoes automatic technical quality and aesthetic filtering, followed by coarse human filtering (not pro), detailed expert evaluation (including art education specialists), captioning, and domain-based classification into certain categories.

Balanced sampling across different content categories during training Specialized fine-tuning for particular content types while maintaining overall model coherence Controlled mixing ratios between video and image data within training batches Targeted improvement of model performance in specific visual domains Dataset Construction Initial Collection: The initial pool consisted of 93,296 high-resolution video scenes and approximately 10 million images, sourced automatically for their exceptional technical quality (e.g., resolution threshold, lack of artifacts, watermarks) and aesthetic merit. Captioning: For all images we implemented specialized two-stage captioning pipeline to maximize instruction following capability: first, the Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct model generated long textual description for the input image; second, the Qwen3-32B model rewrote this description into several variations: very long, long, medium length, short, and very short. Ablation study was conducted to select the optimal system prompt for each model to ensure the final textual descriptions were maximally accurate and approximated human speech. Since our models were pretrained on both English and Russian textual descriptions, we want to continue this approach during SFT, requesting the language model to return descriptions in both languages simultaneously for consistency. To provide rich textual descriptions for each video, automatic captioning was performed using the SkyCaptioner-V1 [87] and Qwen2.5-VL 32B and 72B [73] models. This process generated multiple caption variants of differing lengths and descriptive density for each record. The captions obtained were cleaned with regular expressions to avoid useless common parts such as \"the image shows\". 18 Multi-Stage Expert Evaluation: The data passed through rigorous two-stage evaluation process with specialized annotator roles: Stage 1 - Technical Screening: Regular annotators assessed content based on fundamental quality criteria included: Presence and prominence of main object Proper cropping and framing Spatial depth perception Absence of visual artifacts Stage 2 - Comprehensive Quality Assessment: Qualified experts with background in cinematography and visual arts evaluated the pre-filtered content using detailed questionnaires listed below: Image Evaluation Criteria Exposure and contrast correctness Horizon line positioning Composition geometry Object silhouette quality Lighting and color scheme Absence of unwanted objects Overall artistic expressiveness Natural, non-AI appearance Organic integration Need for modifications Exceptional \"wow factor\" quality Video Evaluation Criteria Video integrity and completeness Clarity of content and action Main object presence and highlighting Dynamic properties (high/low) Color solution and grading Framing correctness Horizon line positioning Composition quality: rule of thirds, central, diagonal Depth and volumetrics Exposure correctness Suitability for editing Complexity of content Aesthetic and artistic expression Specialized Text Handling: Images containing text underwent additional evaluation with specialized criteria: Text clarity and legibility Appropriate text overlay integration Absence of unusual letter distortions Harmonious text-background relationship Special categorization for poster/cover designs Quality Thresholds: For the first version (v1) of the dataset, the selection was based on agreement on \"good\" strict criteria requiring consensus among evaluators (minimum 3 2 ratings across all parameters). This rigorous approach resulted in the selection of approximately 3% of the initial video pool and 5% of images, prioritizing content with clearly defined subjects, balanced composition, and high production values. We conducted extensive research on question selection, acceptance thresholds, and artifact detection. This led to two dataset versions: v1 (strict): 2,833 video scenes and 45,000 images with comprehensive criteria v2 (relaxed): 12,461 video scenes and 153,000 images with optimized thresholds During fine-tuning, we sample from both datasets with calibrated probabilities to balance quality and diversity. VLM Domain Organization Both video and image data were classified into 9 consistent domains using the Qwen2.5VL-Instruct-32B model [73].

(b) Distribution of data across VLM domains and subdomains. Figure 9: Data distributions for different domain classification and clustering strategies used during T2I SFT dataset organization. 21 Advanced Domain Organization and SFT-soup Composition Ablation Study For the Text-to-Image (T2I) model, we employed more sophisticated hierarchical domain organization strategy. We experimented with multiple domain decomposition strategies for following optimal SFTsoup composition: VLM Domain Classification: Full fine-tuning was performed on each VLM domain from the previous section with reduced batch size (64 vs. 4096 in pretrain) and learning rate (1e-5 vs. 1e-4). CLIP Embedding Clustering: We alternativeively used CLIP-ViT-H-14-quickgelu embeddings with k-means clustering into 9 clusters. This approach increased data diversity within individual components, reducing overfitting and enabling longer training for better realism. Hierarchical VLM Domains: Each VLM domain was further divided into 2-9 semantically coherent subdomains. Separate full fine-tuning on these smaller, more homogeneous subsets allowed for targeted improvement in specific visual characteristics while maintaining overall coherence. For weight merging in SFT-soup composition, we compared three approaches: equal weights (1/N), weights proportional to dataset size, and weights proportional to the square root of dataset size. Our experiments showed that equal weights or root-proportional weights performed best. The hierarchical domain approach yielded the best results in side-by-side evaluations, achieving high realism, improved text rendering quality, and compositionally correct generated images. The resulting SFT dataset represents carefully curated collection of visual content that exemplifies high aesthetics and enables robust model fine-tuning across diverse visual domains."

The number of CrossDiT blocks varies depending on the model size.

The model takes four distinct types of inputs: Text: Text embeddings from Qwen2.5-VL are passed through Linear layer and LayerNorm [88]. One-dimensional positional embeddings are also generated for the text using Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) [89]. These are combined and fed into the Linguistic Token Refiner (LTF) module. This module, which is CrossDiT block without the cross-attention component (see Figure 11), serves to enhance the text representation and eliminate the positional bias inherited from the pre-trained text encoder [90]. The refined text queries are then fed into the main CrossDiT blocks via the cross-attention mechanism [91].

            "content": "To reduce the computational complexity of attention layers and accelerate the training process for high-resolution (up to 1024px) or long-duration (up to 10 seconds) video generation, we employ NABLA (Neighborhood-Adaptive Block-Level Attention) - sparse attention mechanism that dynamically constructs content-aware masks for efficient video diffusion transformers. Figure 12: The block-sparse attention mask is computed by (1) reducing the dimensionality of queries (Q) and keys (K), (2) sparsifying the softmax distribution via cumulative density function (CDF) threshold and binarizing the result, and (3) mapping the sparse mask back to the original input blocks. As shown in Figure 12, NABLA constructs content-aware sparse attention masks through three-stage process: 1. Block-wise dimensionality reduction: Queries and keys are average-pooled by groups of = 64 elements, reducing the attention map computation complexity by factor of 2 = 4096 while maintaining the structural relationships essential for video coherence. 2. Adaptive sparsification via CDF thresholding: For each attention head, we compute the cumulative distribution function of the reduced attention map and dynamically select the most relevant blocks by thresholding at 1 thr, where thr controls the sparsity level. This ensures that each head preserves its unique attention pattern tailored to the input content. 3. Border artifact suppression: The resulting adaptive mask is optionally combined with Sliding-Tile Attention patterns through union operation to maintain local continuity and suppress potential border artifacts that can occur in high-resolution generation. NABLA employs token reordering through fractal flattening with spatial patches of size (P = 8), grouping all tokens within each patch into contiguous sequences of 2 = = 64 25 tokens while preserving the original temporal ordering as illustrated in Figure 15. This reorganization optimizes memory access patterns by ensuring spatially adjacent tokens remain contiguous in memory, significantly improving computational efficiency during attention computation. The reordering operation is applied at the DiT network input with its inverse at the output, maintaining proper spatial relationships throughout the processing pipeline. Figure 13: Real attention maps. Figure 14: STA masks with different window sizes. Figure 15: Token reordering illustration for latent image with height 16, width 16, and patch size 8. The diagram shows how spatial tokens are reorganized into fractalflattened sequences while preserving their semantic relationships. NABLA generates head-specific sparsity patterns that adapt to varying attention maps observed in real transformer layers (Figure 13), overcoming limitations of fixed sparse patterns like STA (Figure 14) that may not capture complex long-range dependencies required for coherent video generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that NABLA achieves up to 2.7 speedup in training and inference while maintaining equivalent generation quality to full attention, as validated by both quantitative metrics (CLIP, VBench) and human evaluations. NABLA integrates seamlessly with PyTorchs FlexAttention framework without requiring custom CUDA kernels or additional loss functions, making it practical for both training and inference of large-scale video generation models.

            "content": "We pre-train our models on standard NVIDIA multi-node cluster. Each node contains 8 GPUs connected by NVLink. InfiniBand was used for inter-node connection. We used S3 instead of NFS to store dataset because the weight of the dataset was O(10) Pb and NFS is too expensive for this case. 26 6.1.1 Data Storage All data were stored in an S3-compatible object storage and streamed during training over 100 Gbit/s link. The storage system allowed only O(103) concurrent connections, so the data pipeline was designed to keep the number of opened objects small and the throughput per connection high. Latent pre-encoding and storage layout. To reduce I/O and avoid repeated encoder calls on the fly, all images and videos were pre-encoded with the VAE, and VAE latents were stored instead of raw pixels. These latents were then packed into .tar archives so that each archive had approximately the same size. The number of samples per archive was chosen as function of resolution and modality: Images Low resolution: 1024 latents per tar Medium resolution: 256 latents per tar High resolution: 64 latents per tar Videos (one latent here denotes the full VAE-latent sequence for video) Low resolution: 16 video latents per tar Medium resolution: 4 video latents per tar High resolution: 1 video latent per tar This scheme keeps archive sizes roughly uniform across resolutions while minimizing the total number of S3 objects that need to be opened during training. Text embeddings. Caption text embeddings were computed on the fly during training rather than stored in S3. single text embedding is approximately 50 larger than low resolution (e.g., 256256) image latent; precomputing and storing all text embeddings would therefore significantly increase both the storage footprint and the per-object size, putting additional pressure on the S3 bandwidth and connection limits. Computing them online keeps the S3 load dominated by compact image/video latents and simplifies the storage layout. 6.1.2 DataLoader Design The data loader was implemented as twostage pipeline. dedicated worker process streamed .tar archives from S3, unpacked them on the fly, and pushed individual VAE latents into in-memory queues. Each queue corresponded to particular aspect ratio (e.g., 1:1, 16:9, 4:3), so that the main training process could sample shape-compatible clips without additional padding or resizing (see Figure 16a). The main process constructed batches by repeatedly popping video latents from selected aspect-ratio queue until the sum of their temporal lengths reached predefined maximum: (cid:88) ti tmax. Images were treated as videos of length 1, but they were always sampled in image-only batches. This allowed us to explicitly control the global fraction of image steps during training: high proportion of images in mixed batches was empirically found to degrade convergence on video tasks. Concatenating videos of different lengths into single batch in this way significantly reduced idle time and improved GPU utilization. For large temporal contexts we additionally 27 (a) Data loader scheme with S3 streaming, tar unpacking, and aspect-ratio queues. (b) Histogram of video latent temporal lengths in the dataset. Figure 16: Data streaming pipeline and distribution of video temporal lengths. employed adaptive attention, so the cost of processing one long video was comparable to processing several shorter clips with the same total number of tokens. The distribution of temporal lengths in the dataset (Figure 16b) is highly skewed: most videos are close to the maximum allowed length, with relatively small but non-negligible portion of shorter clips, which makes this dynamic batching strategy particularly beneficial. 6.1.3 Distributed Training and Memory Optimization We used HSDP [93] for distributed training at all stages, from low resolutions up to the final high resolution setting. Starting from the medium resolution stage, we additionally enabled Sequence Parallel [94]. The weights of the Diffusion Transformer were partitioned across 64 GPUs, and the text encoder weights were partitioned across 32 GPUs. This sharding scheme provided full overlap of computation and communication at all training stages and resulted in very low per-GPU memory usage for both model parameters and optimizer states. We chose Sequence Parallel instead of Tensor Parallel because it requires only two collective operations per transformer block (before and after the self-attention module). Sharding the weights inside single block was unnecessary, as the block itself was relatively lightweight. For HD video training with 10-second sequences, we used the maximum sequence-parallel sharding over 8 GPUs, which ensured that all collectives stayed within single NVLink island. Checkpointing was performed in non-blocking manner. Each of the 64 processes wrote its parameter shard directly to storage, without reconstructing the full state_dict on any node. 28 Figure 17: Activation memory traces for standard activation checkpointing (top) and activation checkpointing with host offloading (bottom). Activation checkpointing and offloading. To further reduce memory usage we applied activation checkpointing [95] the granularity of transformer blocks. During pre-training we used the classical scheme, storing only subset of activations and recomputing the rest during the backward pass. For the RL fine-tuning stage, where we had to keep activations for the entire generation trajectory, we used an extended variant with offloading: the inputs to each transformer block were temporarily moved from GPU memory to host RAM between the forward and backward passes. Offloading was implemented in non-blocking fashion: devicehost transfers were issued asynchronously and overlapped with computation. As result, the additional data movement did not noticeably slow down training while still providing substantial reduction in peak activation memory. The effect of this modification is illustrated in Figure 17. Compared to standard activation checkpointing (top trace), activation checkpointing with offloading (bottom trace) significantly lowers the peak activation footprint while preserving similar compute pattern."

The image generation model undergoes an additional Reinforcement Learning (RL)- based Post-Training stage (Section 6.6) for visual quality enhancement. Figure 18 illustrates the overall scheme of training stages. More specifically: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite 6B models. Both models share common backbone from initial pre-training on text-to-image generation at low (192, 256, 320, 352, etc) and medium (384, 29 Figure 18: The training stages for models of the Kandinsky 5.0 family. 30 512, 640, etc) resolutions. Kandinsky 5.0 T2I Lite continues text-to-image pre-training at high resolution (1024, 1280, 1408, etc) and then undergoes SFT and RL-based post-training for enhanced visual quality. Kandinsky 5.0 Image Editing inherits the checkpoint from the shared medium resolution pre-training stage and then undergoes two instructional editing fine-tuning stages at medium and high resolutions with subsequent SFT. During these three stages, the model performs instructional editing 80% and text-to-image generation 20% of cases. The pre-training begins with independent text-to-image Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite 2B models. generation stage with low resolution. Subsequently, during most stages, the model is trained to solve three tasks simultaneously text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image-to-video generation with probabilities of 1%, 79%, and 20%, respectively. This approach is applied during the pre-training stages at low and high resolutions with maximum video length of 5 seconds, after which an SFT stage for this video length follows. During the pretraining stage with maximum video length of 10 seconds, we employ the NABLA mechanism to enhance the efficiency of the attention operation (see Section 5.4). After this stage, we conduct fine-tuning for the image-to-video generation task and an SFT stage with video In length of 5 seconds to obtain specialized 5-second version of the model for this task. parallel, we continue to train the model for all three tasks simultaneously with video length of 10 seconds during the subsequent SFT and distillation stages, ultimately yielding the text-tovideo generation model Kandinsky 5.0 T2V Lite, image-to-video generation model Kandinsky 5.0 I2V Lite and accelerated version, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite Flash. Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro 19B models. The pre-training for these models also begins with independent stage of text-to-image generation at low resolution. We then conduct 4 stages of pre-training, as well as SFT, on the tasks of text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation with probabilities of 2%, 77%, and 21%, respectively. During pre-training stages, we increase the maximum resolution to 1024 pixels and the maximum video length from 5 to 10 seconds. For the high resolution, we use the NABLA mechanism (Section 5.4). We also conduct specialized fine-tuning on the image-to-video generation task for Kandinsky 5.0 I2V Lite model, followed by an SFT stage. As result of distillation of the model, which solves the three aforementioned tasks, we obtain the accelerated version, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro Flash."

Below, we elaborate on each scheme in detail. Text-to-Image Generation. This scheme is applied for training all models, including the initial pre-training stages for video generation (see the training schemes in Figure 18). The input to CrossDiT consists of noisy image latent, the timestep in the diffusion process, and text representation of the image description from the Qwen2.5-VL encoder [73] using the following template caption prompt: \"<im_start>systemnYou are promt engineer. Describe the image by detailing the color, shape, size, texture, quantity, text, spatial relationships of the objects and background:<im_end>\", \"<im_start>usern{}<im_end>\". An image description is inserted into usern{}. This format of text input is more suitable for VLM text encoder, which is trained on instructions [90]. The model also receives CLIP [51] text (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 19: Pre-training setups for text-to-image generation (a), instruct image editing (b), textto-video (c) and image-to-video regimes (d) for Kandinsky 5.0 models. embedding corresponding to the full image description. For pre-training the video model, single-channel mask of zeros is added to the image. Text-to-Image Instruct Editing. This scheme is used for training Kandinsky 5.0 Image Editing. It differs from the previous one in that the input noisy image is channel-wise concatenated with an instruct image, which serves as reference for the editing task, and single-channel mask of ones. The instruct image is also fed into Qwen2.5-VL along with the textual image description, supplemented by the following instruct prompt: \"<im_start>systemnYou are promt engineer. Based on the provided source image (first image) and target image (second image), create an interesting text prompt that can be used together with the source image to create the target image:<im_end>\", 32 \"<im_start>usern{}\". Text-to-Video Generation. Here, the input to the video transformer is sequence of noisy frames with zero-valued single-channel mask. For 1024 resolution or for videos up to 10 seconds long at 512 resolution, CrossDiT incorporates the NABLA mechanism (Section 5.4); in other cases, full attention is applied to the video sequence. For this task, the corresponding caption prompt is also used to describe the video. Image-to-Video Generation. unlike the other frames, is accompanied by single-channel mask of ones. The first frame of the video sequence remains unnoised and, 6.3.2 Training details We train all our models at the pre-training stage with the AdamW optimizer [96] with betas=(0.9, 0.95) and eps=1.0e-08, changing the learning rate and weight_decay depending on the training stage (see Table 4). We use scheduler warmup for all pre-training stages, limit the gradient norm to one, and also apply an exponential moving average with parameter of 0.9999. During training, we use unconditional data examples with probability of 0.1. Other parameters that depend on the models and training stages, such as the batch size, the number of optimizer steps, and the probabilities of spatial resolutions used in the trained data are presented in Table 4."

            "content": "This section outlines the general concept of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for our models, following the established training protocol (see Figure 18). The approaches described below are applicable for all SFT stages in the training procedure. 6.4.1 Image Generation Following the pretraining stage, we perform supervised fine-tuning on dataset of 153 thousand high-quality, realistic images with detailed text descriptions. Data selection was conducted by annotators based on range of criteria, including technical quality, composition, perspective, lighting, colour palette, and overall aesthetics. For more details, please refer to Section 4.6. We found that direct full fine-tuning of the pretrained model on the entire SFT dataset yielded unsatisfactory results; namely, it maintained non-photorealistic style, degraded text alignment, and reduced the quality of text rendering within images. Consequently, we employ model souping technique [86, 97] with hierarchical clustering. The source dataset is clustered into 9 thematic domains (e.g., people, nature) using VLM. To further enhance composition, realism, and text rendering, each domain is subsequently segmented into 2-9 semantically homogeneous subdomains (Figure 9). We perform independent full fine-tuning on each subdomain with batch size of 64 and peak learning rate of 1e-5. Training on subdomain is halted upon the emergence of generation artifacts on the validation set, such as geometrical distortions or colour aberrations. The resulting checkpoints within single main domain are then aggregated via weighted summation of their model parameters, with weights proportional to the square root of the size of each subdomain. The final model is obtained by performing weighted averaging of the nine domainspecific models. This technique leads to significant improvements across all target metrics in side-by-side human evaluation, enabling the model to achieve high level of realism, text alignment, and compositional quality. 33 Table 4: Parameters for different stages of Kandinsky 5.0 models pre-training.

The video SFT dataset consists of approximately 2.8 thousand videos and 45 thousand images that underwent strict manual selection process based on multiple criteria. For more details on the video data collection for SFT refer to Section 4.6. During standard fine-tuning of the Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite model, we observed overfitting after approximately 10 thousand steps. The best results for the 5-second model were achieved using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) checkpoint after 10 thousand iterations. We implement the souping method for video similarly to the approach for images: the data is partitioned into nine thematic domains using VLM. We train separate model on each domain and then perform uniform averaging of their weights. Although the individual domain models are prone to overfitting and generating artifacts, their averaged version demonstrates high visual quality and generation stability. In our internal side-by-side evaluations, the model obtained through souping outperformed the standard SFT model in visual quality, motion consistency, and absence of artifacts, while maintaining equivalent text alignment. Examples of comparing the generations before and after the SFT stage are presented in Figure 27."

            "content": "Figure 20: Adversarial post-training for diffusion distilled model. We present two distinct classes of distilled models for video generation, each optimized for different balance of sampling speed and visual fidelity: 1. Guidance Distilled Model. The first model variant is produced via Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) Distillation [42]. This process directly distills the sampling trajectory of base model, conditioned on CFG scale, into model that requires fewer number of function evaluations (NFEs). Starting from base model requiring 100 NFEs, we applied CFG distillation with null prompt and an optimal CFG scale of 5.0. This yielded distilled model capable of generating samples of comparable quality in just 50 NFEs 2x speedup. According to our internal side-by-side human evaluation, the CFG Distilled model preserves the semantic composition, texture detail, motion coherence, and prompt alignment of the original model without perceptible degradation. 2. Diffusion Distilled Model. The second variant is more aggressively distilled model, produced through two-stage pipeline designed to maximize inference speed. This version is the basis for the Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite Flash and Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro Flash models. (a) Initial CFG Distillation: We first applied Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation (TSCD) [43] to the CFG-checkpoint, distilling it into model requiring only 16 NFEs. This stage prioritizes significant reduction in inference cost. 35 (b) Adversarial Post-Training: The model resulting from the first stage achieves high speed but exhibits deficit in visual fidelity. To address this, we performed secondstage refinement using an adversarial training framework inspired by LADD [98] and (Figure 20). The adversarial training was conducted using Hinge loss objective. We used the RMSprop optimizer [99] for both the generator (student model) and the discriminator, with learning rates of 1e-6 and 1e-4, respectively. Gradient clipping with maximum norm of 1.0 was applied to stabilize training. critical component for stabilizing our adversarial training was the application of stochastic perturbation to images before feeding them to the discriminator. Specifically, both real and generated images are perturbed with Gaussian noise, with the noise level sampled from Logit-Normal(-4, 1) timestep distribution. We found that this re-noising strategy, as also explored in [100], significantly improves training stability compared to feeding clean images to the discriminator. Furthermore, this approach eliminates the need for an R1 gradient penalty, simplifying the training objective and reducing computational overhead."

To further enhance the visual quality and realism of generated images, we apply RL-based post-training techniques, which consist of two main parts training reward model (Figure 21) and RL-based fine-tuning stage of the image generation model with feedback from trained reward model (Figure 24). 36 Figure 22: Training loss, validation loss and validation accuracy for reward model. Figure 23: The scores distribution of the reward model on the validation set. As the number of steps increases, the distribution looks more like delta function. Reward Model Training Data. We conduct experiments to train the reward model using real data collected for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage (see Section 4.6), as well as generations from the Kandinsky 5.0 Image model after the pre-training and SFT stages. To form the dataset for reward model training, we used heuristic, that allowed us to skip the usual for RLHF [101] (Reinforcement Learning on Human Feedback) data annotation process and still get very good results from RL-based post-training stage. We supposed that by design image generated from pre-train checkpoint is worse, than image generated from SFT checkpoint, which is worse, than the real, not generated, image from SFT set. This way, we collected our (xw, xl, y) samples for reward model training. Relative Reward Training. Our approach is based on the Reward Dance method [102]. For the reward, we are training visual-language model, which we initialize from Qwen 2.5VL7B [73]. The reward model takes two annotated images with text description as input, and then returns whether the first image is better or not. The model is trained to return Yes, when the first image is better and No, when the first image is worse. The value, that reward returns, that will be used as feedback for the generative model is the probability of the token Yes as the answer for whether the image on position 1 is better, i.e.: R(x1, x2, y) = (Yesx1, x2, y). 37 Figure 24: Fine-tuning of the image generation model with feedback from Reward Model. Figure 22 shows the training loss for the reward model, as well as the loss and accuracy values on the validation set for the reward outputs. Figure 23 shows plot of the reward model scores for different numbers of training steps on the validation set. It can be seen that as the number of steps increases, overfitting occurs and the plot increasingly resembles delta function. During training, we monitor this plot and the standard deviation value σ for Gaussian kernel density estimation to avoid overfitting. As result, we selected the reward model trained for 1300 steps. RL-based post-training For RL-based tuning we utilize Direct Reward Fine-Tuning (DRaFT) method [103], specifically we use the DRaFT-K version (Algorithm 1 from the original paper). Specifically, we generate an image using our model that has undergone the SFT stage and only backpropagate gradients through the last few generation steps. For the second image, we take real image from the SFT dataset and maximize the probability that the generated image will be chosen as better by the reward model. We also use the KullbackLeibler divergence between the distributions of images generated by the SFT-stage model pSF and the model being trained pRL. In the case of flow-matching models [3], the KL-divergence takes the following form: KL(pRL pSF ) = (cid:88) vRL(xt, t) vSF (xt, t)2, where vRL, vSF are the outputs of the image generation model in the trainable (pRL) and frozen post-SFT (pSF ) versions respectively, xt is the denoising result after the first steps of the pRL model, and the sum is taken only over those final generation steps for which gradients are backpropagated through the pRL model. The final loss looks as follows: = LRL + βKL KL(pRL pSF ), where LRL = 1 R(x, xreal, y) is RL loss term, is the image generated with gradients for the last steps, as proposed by DRaFT-K algorithm from paper [103], xreal is the real image from SFT set, that corresponds to the text prompt y. For text-to-image model, optimal βKL equals to 38 2e-2 and = 10 for DRaFT-K. The training plots for the generation model during the RL-based training are shown in Figure 25. Figure 25: KL loss and final loss for RL-based post-training of image model. Other Experiments. We also investigated other approaches, including the use of differentiable absolute reward [103, 104, 105], as well as using two generated images for relative reward with and without gradient backpropagation on the final steps, selecting the best image from generated ones as the reference image as proposed in [102]. We tried using two generations as input to the reward model, but eventually in our experiments we found that using relative reward with real image from the SFT dataset as reference sample results in the best quality."

            "title": "10.1 Image Generation",
            "content": "The development of visual generative models has undergone transformative shifts over the past decade, driven by advances in deep learning architectures and training paradigms. Early breakthroughs began with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [110], which introduced adversarial training between generator and discriminator to synthesize realistic data. While GANs demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent images, their limitations mode collapse, unstable training dynamics, and difficulty scaling to high resolutions spurred exploration of alternative approaches. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [111, 112] offered probabilistic framework for learning latent representations, but often produced blurry outputs due to their reliance on pixel-wise reconstruction losses. Concurrently, autoregressive models like PixelRNN [113] and ImageGPT [114] achieved high sample quality by sequentially predicting image pixels or patches, though at the cost of impractical inference speeds and computational demands. paradigm shift emerged with the introduction of diffusion models [1], which reframed generation as an iterative denoising process. By gradually corrupting data with noise and training model to reverse this process, diffusion models avoided the instability of GANs while achieving superior sample diversity. The subsequent integration of classifier-free guidance [115] enabled precise control over conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis. However, the computational expense of pixel-space diffusion remained barrier until Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) [4] demonstrated that operating in compressed latent space learned via some kind of autoencoder could drastically reduce training and inference costs while maintaining high-resolution output quality. This innovation democratized generative AI, enabling open-source projects like Stable Diffusion to flourish. The next leap forward came with the fusion of diffusion frameworks and transformer architectures. Diffusion Transformers (DiT) [17] replaced the traditional U-Net backbone with scalable transformer blocks, capitalizing on their ability to model long-range dependencies and adhere to predictable scaling laws. DiTs success in text-to-image generation paved the way for its adaptation to video synthesis, where models like Sora [23] leveraged spatio-temporal attention to generate coherent, high-fidelity videos. These architectures further incorporated techniques such as flow matching [3] to streamline the alignment of latent trajectories and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance multimodal conditioning."

            "content": "Video generation technology has sparked widespread interest across industrial and academic domains, catalyzing rapid advancements in synthetic media. The rise of generative models capable of producing studio-grade video content has transformed creative workflows, slashing production costs while improving output quality. Much of this progress comes from open source initiatives, with projects such as HunyuanVideo [26], Mochi [27], CogVideoX [28], and Wan [116] democratizing access to foundational architectures and pretrained weights. These efforts have narrowed though not closed the gap between open-source and proprietary systems. The frontier of modern video generation now extends well beyond basic text-to-video conversion, encompassing rich spectrum of interconnected tasks that push the boundaries of temporal modeling. Contemporary systems must handle: image-to-video (I2V) and reference-to-video (R2V) synthesis where static compositions spring to life while maintaining geometric consistency [14]; video-to-video (V2V) transformations for style transfer and content editing [117]; video-to-audio (V2A) generation that creates synchronized soundscapes from visual dynamics [118]; and sophisticated first-last frame interpolation that infers natural 60 motion between sparse keyframes [119]. Perhaps the most cinematographically challenging is the precise camera control, which requires models to understand the principles of virtual cinematography, from panning to dolly zoom effects [120]. 10.2.1 Attention mechanism optimizations Video Generation come at significant computational cost, particularly in latent-space video models, where attention is focused on compressed representations. While standard image diffusion uses attention maps of size (H/fs W/fs)2 for latent dimensions H/fs W/fs (where fs is spatial downsampling factor), video models must handle relationships (T /ft H/fs W/fs)2 - where ft represents temporal compression in the Video VAE [121]. This quadratic scaling has led to several optimization approaches in recent works: Memory-Efficient Attention: The Flash Attention algorithm [122],[107] provides 2.4-3.1 speedups for video generation by: Computing attention scores in tiles to reduce GPU memory bandwidth; Fusing kernel operations to avoid expensive memory reads/writes; Supporting mixed-precision calculations with minimal accuracy loss. The recently proposed Sliding Tile Attention [20] addresses computational bottlenecks in video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through hardware-aware sparsity. Key innovations include: Tile-based computation: Processes video latents as 3D tiles rather than individual tokens, eliminating irregular attention masks while preserving spatial-temporal locality. Asynchronous memory pipeline: Implements producer-consumer warpgroups to overlap data loading with computation, achieving 58.79% MFU (model FLOPs utilization). Training-free adaptation: Automatic window size configuration per attention head via score profiling, enabling 1.36 speedup with 98% quality retention."

One way to use this data is to align our model directly to the annotations with algorithms like DPO [123]. Another way is to train reward model to give generative model feedback on its outputs and then perform training procedure on the generative model, that would maximize the scores of this reward. In the works [124, 104] it was proposed to initialize the reward model as CLIP [51] and train it in contrastive manner on the collected human annotations of multiple images, that correspond to the same caption, for example, with contrastive Bradley-Terry loss (see formulas (1) and (2) in the work [105]). This approach for reward training can be applied for Visual Language Models (VLMs) and after training they can be utilized as reward models. In the paper [125] authors suggested training Qwen2.5-VL [73] to output score from 1 to 5 for given 61 image. In the work [126] authors proposed to add an additional linear regression head on the logits of the output of VLM, which turns it into regression model for reward prediction. All these aforementioned approaches for rewards are only capable of getting single image as input on RLHF stage. In the work [102] it was noted by authors, that reward models, that operate comparatively on the pairs of images on RLHF stage tend to give better feedback and provide all necessary ablation studies to show, that comparison is more robust way to use reward model. RL-based fine-tuning methods for diffusion models, that utilize rewards can be divided into two categories: direct optimization of reward through computations of gradients [104, 103] and common RLHF algorithms, that do not require computations of gradients for output of reward model [127, 128]. In the work [102] authors also suggested adaptation of gradientbased algorithms for rewards, that take multiple image/video samples as inputs. Adaptation of GRPO [128] for rewards, that operate on multiple images, was proposed in the paper [129]."

            "title": "10.4 Distillation Methods",
            "content": "Diffusion models generate high-quality samples but are computationally expensive, as they require solving complex differential equation through many iterative steps, each involving an expensive network evaluation [130]. Distillation methods address this by learning simpler differential equation that results in the same final data distribution at timestep = 0 but follows straighter, more linear trajectory. This allows for larger step sizes and, consequently, fewer network evaluations [131, 132]. Existing distillation techniques can be broadly categorized. Deterministic methods aim to predict the exact output of the teacher model using fewer steps. While easy to train with regression loss, they often produce blurry results in few-step generation due to optimization inaccuracies [133]. Distributional methods, on the other hand, only aim to approximate the teachers output distribution and often employ adversarial or distribution-matching objectives to achieve higher perceptual quality [58, 134]. Key distillation families include: 1. Progressive Distillation. This method iteratively distills teacher model into student that halves the number of required sampling steps. While effective, it suffers from error accumulation as multiple rounds of distillation are typically needed [130, 42]. 2. Consistency Distillation. This approach trains student model to map any point along the probability flow ODE trajectory directly to the origin, ensuring self-consistency across timesteps. It can be performed in single stage but often requires careful tuning and specialized techniques like distillation schedules for stable training [132, 135, 136]. Improved versions, such as Multistep Consistency Models and Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), have since been developed [137, 136]. 3. Adversarial Distillation. For high-quality, few-step generation, adversarial training has become prominent. Methods like Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) use pretrained feature extractor as discriminator, enabling performance competitive with large teacher models like SDXL in as few as four steps [58, 133]. Other approaches combine adversarial loss against real data with score distillation from the teacher model [138, 58]. related strategy is Rectified Flow, which straightens the ODE trajectories to make them easier to approximate [131, 139]. Another early approach, Knowledge Distillation, involved precomputing dataset of noise-image pairs from the teacher model to train one-step student, requirement later methods eliminated [140]. 62 While most distillation research focuses on image generation, these principles are also being applied to video generation, with recent works demonstrating one-step or few-step generation of high-resolution videos [141, 142, 143]."

            "title": "10.5 Generative Model Evaluation",
            "content": "Reliable evaluation of text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) generative models remains significant challenge. While automated metrics offer scalability, they often exhibit weak correlation with human judgment, particularly for complex attributes such as semantic coherence, temporal dynamics, fine-grained object fidelity, and compositional reasoning. Commonly used image metrics include Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [144], Kernel Inception Distance (KID) [145], and CLIP Score [39]; for video, Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) [37] and scores based on representations from Video Foundation Models like InternVideo2 [84] are frequently adopted. However, these metrics primarily assess distributional similarity or coarse semantic alignment and struggle to capture motion realism, physical plausibility, adherence to compositional prompts, or dynamic consistency over time. Recent efforts have sought to address these gaps through more structured and finegrained benchmarks. The latest iteration, T2I-CompBench++ [146] introduces 8,000 prompts across four categories and eight sub-categories, including generative numeracy and 3D spatial relationships alongside attribute binding and object interactions. It proposes tailored evaluation metricssuch as Disentangled BLIP-VQA for attribute binding and UniDet-based metric with depth estimation for 3D layout and countingdemonstrating strong correlation with human judgments. T2V-CompBench [147] establishes the comprehensive benchmark for compositional text-to-video generation, featuring 1,400 prompts across seven categories: consistent and dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships, motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy. It introduces suite of specialized metricsMLLM-based (Grid-LLaVA, D-LLaVA), detection-based (GroundingDINO), and tracking-based (DOT)validated through extensive human correlation studies. The benchmark reveals that current T2V models struggle profoundly with dynamic attribute changes, motion direction, and multi-object counting. Complementing this, DEVIL [148] introduces dynamics-centric evaluation protocol that quantifies models ability to generate videos with appropriate levels of motion intensity and temporal change as specified by the prompt. It defines three key metricsdynamics range, dynamics controllability, and dynamics-based qualityand reveals that many state-of-theart models cheat by generating low-dynamic videos to inflate traditional quality scores. Both T2V-CompBench and DEVIL highlight that current T2V models still struggle with finegrained prompt adherence, especially in dynamic and compositional settings. As result, human evaluationespecially pairwise side-by-side (SBS) comparisonshas become the de facto standard for model assessment in high-stakes settings. SBS studies provide interpretable, attribute-level judgments (e.g., on visual quality, motion smoothness, or prompt following) and demonstrate stronger alignment with perceptual quality than automated scores. Nevertheless, human evaluation is resource-intensive and requires careful design to ensure reliability, including sufficient rater overlap, trained annotators, and measurement of inter-rater agreement. Recent large-scale benchmarks such as MovieGen [31] now incorporate structured human evaluation protocols alongside automatic metrics, acknowledging that robust model comparison necessitates both scalable proxies and humangrounded validation."

            "title": "11 Limitations and Further Work",
            "content": "While the models from Kandinsky 5.0 family demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in generation stability and visual quality, our work has several limitations that outline promising directions for future research: Text-Visual Alignment. Quantitative results in side-by-side (SBS) evaluations, indicate slight lag in textual prompt understanding compared to some competing solution. We attribute this primarily to the limited context length (256 tokens) of the Qwen2.5-VL 7B text encoder used in the our pipeline. Future work will focus on improving text alignment by integrating more powerful text encoders with extended context windows and exploring advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning techniques for better prompt understanding; Temporal Consistency for Complex Dynamics. Although the spatio-temporal attention mechanism ensures robust frame-to-frame stability, modeling long-range, complex physical interactions (e.g., fluid dynamics, cloth simulation) remains challenging. In sequences longer than 10 seconds, these interactions can occasionally exhibit artifacts. Enhancing the physical realism and long-term temporal consistency of such dynamic phenomena is key objective for our next model iteration; Generalization Ability. Despite the models broad knowledge of the visual world, its performance is not uniform across all styles, objects, and scenes. This limitation stems from inherent dataset quirks, including class imbalance and stylistic or semantic biases within the training data. We are actively investigating methods for intelligent data curation and the assembly of more representative and higher-quality training set. Ultimately, we aim to enhance the models robustness for deployment in real-world scenarios such as autonomous systems, virtual reality (VR), simulation, and world models; Creating Foundation Visual Model. The current Kandinsky 5.0 is family of specialized, high-quality open-source models dedicated to specific generative tasks. significant long-term goal is to consolidate these capabilities into single, unified foundational model for multimedia generation. Such model would possess deeper, more integrated understanding of the visual world and could address multiple tasks without relying on complex model ecosystem; Computational Efficiency. Achieving real-time generation rates (24+ FPS) at high resolutions on consumer-grade hardware remains challenge, despite our optimizations. Our ongoing engineering efforts are directed towards developing more efficient architectures and inference techniques to make high-fidelity generative AI accessible on resource-constrained devices."

            "title": "12 Border Impacts and Ethical Considerations",
            "content": "Our open-source release of Kandinsky 5.0 is designed to democratize access to cutting-edge generative technology while promoting responsible AI development. In line with this goal, we are releasing the model code and training checkpoints under the permissive MIT license. We have deliberately chosen not to implement built-in content filtering systems, believing that this approach fosters innovation, advances the field of generative media, and encourages users to critically engage with the technology. However, this freedom comes with significant responsibility. We explicitly state that all users are liable for the content they generate and must use the model ethically and legally. 64 (a) teacher. (b) An Asian. (c) An African American. (d) smart human. (e) handsome man. (f) handsome man. Figure 43: Examples of simple prompts that often produce similar results. In some cases, the model use the most common and well-established concepts of popular culture. The following sections detail critical ethical considerations and limitations associated with the Kandinsky 5.0 model family. 1. Inherent Sociocultural Biases. Like all large-scale models trained on web-scale datasets, Kandinsky 5.0 inherits and can amplify societal biases present in its training data. Cultural Stereotypes: The models \"knowledge\" of the visual world is reflection 65 Figure 44: Prompt: doctor. The model demonstrates diversity in terms of gender and race. of the most prevalent data online, which can perpetuate harmful or inaccurate stereotypes. We strongly oppose the use of our model to generate content that promotes hatred or disparages any social group. Representation and Diversity: As shown in Figure 43, the model often reproduces common stereotypes in response to prompts related to profession, gender, age, or ethnicity (e.g., teacher, beautiful man, smart person, Asian). This results in lack of diversity, reinforcing biases found in popular culture. Conversely, the model demonstrates better understanding of diversity in other contexts (Figure 44). To achieve more balanced and representative outputs, users are encouraged to employ specific, descriptive prompts that explicitly call for diversity. 2. Technical Limitations and Unintended Outputs. Users must be aware of the models technical constraints to manage expectations and avoid unintended consequences. Prompt Misunderstanding: The model does not possess deep, semantic understanding of language. An incomplete or ambiguous prompt can potentially lead to the generation of nonsensical, offensive, or otherwise undesirable content. clear comprehension of the systems limitations is essential for safe and effective use. Potential for Misuse: The powerful capability to synthesize realistic images and video carries inherent risk of malicious use. We explicitly prohibit the use of Kandinsky 5.0 for creating disinformation, harassing content, or any material that violates applicable laws. The primary responsibility for mitigating this risk and ensuring ethical application rests with the end-user. By openly acknowledging these challenges, we aim to inform the community, stimulate discussion on mitigation strategies, and empower users to navigate the ethical landscape of generative AI responsibly."
