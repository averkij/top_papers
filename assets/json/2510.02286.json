            "content": "Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024), their potential to produce harmful content when deliberately manipulated remains significant concern. Red-teaming, the process of adversarially testing LLMs to uncover safety vulnerabilities, is critical step in ensuring their responsible use. Early red-teaming efforts focused on single-turn attacks to elicit harmful responses (Liu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2025b). However, realworld interactions with LLMs are inherently conversational, where attackers can iteratively adapt their jailbreaking strategies based on the target models responses. Recent studies demonstrate that multi-turn attacks (Ren et al., 2025; Rahman et al., 2025) achieve higher success rates than singleturn methods, as they can gradually erode safety boundaries through dialogue progression, exploit contextual dependencies across turns, and adjust tactics when initial attempts fail. While being more effective, existing multi-turn methods often rely on manually crafted heuristics or templates (Russinovich et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), and still lack mechanism for learning long-horizon strategies. This is crucial limitation, as the multi-turn attack should not be merely excessive trials, but strategic planning where each turn builds toward long-term goal. We address this gap by formulating red-teaming as strategic reasoning problem in goal-oriented dialogues, where an attacker agent strategically explores the dialogue space, reasons about the target models responses, and adaptively plans sequence of actions to achieve final jailbreak goal. Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Schulman et al., 2017) offers powerful paradigm for this problem, but applying RL to multi-turn red-teaming presents several unique challenges. First, the exploration complexity in multi-turn dialogues is extensive, as each turn offers Work done during internship at Oracle. Correspondence to <rguo48@gatech.edu>. 1 Preprint. numerous possible responses and attack strategies, making the action space grow exponentially and difficult to explore. Second, unlike tasks like math or coding that have verifiable rewards (Shao et al., 2024a; Jin et al., 2025), the jailbreaking task operates with non-verifiable rewards. The outcomes are assessed by imperfect proxy models, i.e., safety guardrails (Lee et al., 2025). Third, the policy optimization for multi-turn red-teaming might suffer from training instability due to the complex gradient updates. To address these challenges, we propose DIALTREE-RPO, new on-policy RL framework designed for multi-turn strategic red-teaming. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) dialogue tree rollout with pruning, which enables structured exploration on diverse attack strategies while eliminating low-quality trajectories to improve training efficiency (3.1); (2) specialized reward function to guide policy learning in multi-turn red-teaming (3.2); and (3) an adaptive masking technique that stabilizes and improves multi-turn policy optimization (3.2). Through extensive experiments across 10 target LLMs, we show that DIALTREE-RPO achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 85.3%, substantially outperforming prior approaches by 25.9% ASR. We also conduct thorough analyses, showing that our DIALTREE-RPO can achieve the highest ASR with the best efficiency, transfer from small model to much larger models, and uncover new attack strategies. Our key contributions are: We formalize red-teaming as conversational strategic reasoning problem and introduce DIALTREE-RPO, new tree-based RL framework to discover adaptive attack strategies. DIALTREE-RPO equips with dialogue tree rollout with quality-aware pruning and adaptive masking to effectively addresses the core challenges of multi-turn RL for red-teaming. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DIALTREE-RPO establishes the new state-ofthe-art red-teaming method with remarkable efficiency and transferability."

            "content": "Problem Setup. We formulate the task of multi-turn red-teaming as goal-oriented, strategic conversation between two agents: an attacker model πθ designed to probe the safety vulnerabilities of target model πtgt. Let be set of red-teaming goals, where each goal specifies unsafe content that the attacker needs to elicit from the target (e.g., Give detailed instructions on how to make bomb). We define the state at turn as st = (cid:8)g, [(c1, q1, r1), . . . , (ct, qt, rt)](cid:9), which consists of the goal and the complete dialogue history up to turn t. The dialogue history at i-th turn consists of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning step ci that strategically plans how to approach the goal, an attack query qi, and the corresponding response ri from the target. Given goal g, the attacker begins by generating an initial action that consists of CoT and attack query, i.e, (c1, q1) πθ( s0), based on the initial state s0 = (g, ). The target responds with r1 πtgt( q1), leading to new state s1 = (g, [(c1, q1, r1)]). Subsequently, the attacker generates an action (ct, qt) πθ( st1) at each turn t. Note that while the attacker has full observability of st1, the target operates under partial observability, i.e., it cannot access the goal and the CoT reasoning {ci}t1 i=1 in the state. Given the attack query qt and the previous history, the target responds with rt πtgt( qt, st1). The interaction continues until either the target is successfully jailbroken or the maximum turn limit Tmax is reached. Training Paradigm. Our objective is to learn an attacker policy πθ that elicits goal-relevant, harmful responses from the target through adaptive interaction within Tmax turns. We train πθ in two stages following RL with cold start paradigm (Guo et al., 2025a). Stage 1 (Cold-Start SFT): We initialize πθ via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on red-teaming conversations paired with CoTs, in order to (i) relax the models safety constraints, and (ii) teach the required output format, i.e., (ct, qt) at each turn t. Stage 2 (RL with DIALTREE-RPO): We optimize πθ with our RL algorithm (3) to improve the attackers capability to explore and exploit the target models vulnerabilities through multi-turn interactions. We formulate the multi-turn red-teaming RL training objective as: max πθ EgD,yπθ(g;πtgt) [rϕ(g, y)] β DKL [πθ(y g; πtgt) πref(y g; πtgt)] , (1) where denotes the initial attack goal sampled from distribution D, is the attackers generated output interleaved with the targets response, πref is reference policy, rϕ is the reward function, and DKL() is regularization term that penalizes deviation from πref, thereby preventing πθ from drifting too far during optimization. 2 Preprint. Figure 1: Illustration of dialogue tree expansion with pruning. (a) Each node st,k denotes state defined by the goal and dialogue histories at the k-th action branch at turn t. Starting from s0, the attacker explores multiple conversation paths across turns, until the target is jailbroken or the maximum turn limit Tmax is reached. Malformed or off-topic branches are pruned at each turn. (b) At each state, the attacker generates candidate actions consisting of CoT and query. Each query is sent to the target to elicit response, resulting in new state. (c) We collect the trajectories that are not pruned from the rollout tree and assign rewards to each trajectory based on whether the target model is jailbroken or not. We set the branching factor = 2 and Tmax = 3 for this figure."

            "content": "TREE SEARCH FOR STRATEGIC RED-TEAMING We propose DIALTREE-RPO, reinforcement learning (RL) framework for multi-turn red-teaming via strategic and adaptive dialogue. DIALTREE-RPO consists of tree-based rollout mechanism with pruning to efficiently explore the vast space of possible attack trajectories (3.1), reward function for red-teaming scenarios where we detect the outcomes of jailbreaking through specialized safety guardrail (3.2), and an adaptive masking technique that improves training stability and performance for multi-turn RL (3.2). We present the details of DIALTREE-RPO in Algorithm 1. 3.1 DIALOGUE TREE ROLLOUT WITH PRUNING To train the attacker policy πθ, fundamental challenge lies in how we can systematically explore the exponentially large space of possible attack conversations to identify the targets vulnerabilities. Standard GRPO approaches typically sample independent trajectories, which in our case correspond to distinct dialogues between two agents. Such linear rollouts cannot explore candidate attacker actions to learn from controlled comparisons at each turn. To address this limitation, we introduce dialogue tree rollout, which enables structured exploration to discover diverse and novel attack strategies within constrained search space anchored by the shared dialogue context. Figure 1 illustrates the dialogue tree rollout with pruning. Starting from an initial goal g, the tree expands while the attacker iteratively interacts with the target across multiple branches. At the beginning of turn t, for each active state denoted as st1 from the previous turn, the attacker samples distinct actions {(ct,k, qt,k)}n k=1 πθ( st1). Each generated attack query qt,k, along with the dialogue history in st1 (without the goal and CoTs), is sent to the target model to elicit response, i.e., rt,k πtgt( qt,k, st1), which yields new state st,k with the triplet (ct,k, qt,k, rt,k) incorporated. Each new state will first be evaluated by safety guardrail to determine whether the target model is jailbroken, i.e., eliciting harmful response or not. If not, we will assess whether the state should be pruned according to our designed criteria. Among the new states {st,k}n k=1 at turn t, the states that are not jailbroken or pruned will remain active for subsequent turns. All expansions will be stopped when the maximum turn limit Tmax is reached. After the tree rollout completes, we collect dialogue trajectories by traversing all paths from the root node s0 to the leaf nodes, excluding Preprint. the branches that were pruned during expansion. Each collected trajectory τ (i) represents complete attack dialogue and is assigned scalar reward R(i) based on whether it successfully jailbroke the target (detailed in 3.2), which we use to compute group-relative advantages for policy optimization. Pruning Criteria. To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of tree search, we employ three pruning criteria to prune low-quality branches at each turn. First, we enforce format validity by discarding nodes where the attacker produces malformed outputs (i.e., missing either the CoT or the query), as these branches cannot continue the dialogue with the desired format. Second, we maintain topic adherence by pruning nodes where the conversation has drifted away from the original goal as determined by an on-topic classifier, ensuring the attacker learns to pursue coherent and goal-directed strategies. Third, to prevent exponential growth in branches, we apply branch limiting by retaining at most nodes per turn through random subsampling from those that pass both format and topic filters. Additional implementation details are provided in Appendix C.2. 3.2 OPTIMIZATION WITH ADAPTIVE MASKING Reward Design. The reward function provides the primary training signal for RL optimization. We design reward for the attacker that encourages generating dialogues that successfully elicit goal-relevant unsafe responses from the target. Specifically, we use HarmAug-Guard (Lee et al., 2025) (denoted as rϕ), lightweight yet competitive guardrail classifier, to compute dialogue-level harmfulness scores (see Appendix D.1 for reward model experiments). Given dialogue trajectory τ = (c1, q1, r1, . . . , cT , qT , rT ) with interaction turns and goal g, the reward is defined as: (cid:40) = if : rϕ(g; qt, rt) > η 1, 0, otherwise (2) where η (0, 1) is decision threshold on harmfulness. We set η = 0.5 by default. Dialogue GRPO. To avoid introducing an additional value function, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024a) in our multi-turn dialogue setting to train the attacker policy πθ. For each goal g, we sample group of trajectories {τ (i)}G i=1 from the old attacker policy πθold and frozen target model πtgt via dialogue tree rollout, where is the group size. We optimize the policy by maximizing the following objective: JGRPO(θ) = gD,{τ (i)}G i=1πθold (cid:34) (g;πtgt) (cid:88) 1 1 τ (i) (cid:32) min τ (i) (cid:88) t= g, τ (i) πθ(τ (i) g, τ (i) πθold (τ (i) (cid:33) <t ; πtgt) <t ; πtgt) ˆA(i) , (cid:35) βDKL(πθ πref) (3) , 1 ε, 1 + ε) ˆA(i) πθ(τ (i) πθold (τ (i) i=1 g, τ (i) g, τ (i) <t ; πtgt) <t ; πtgt) clip( where ε and β are hyperparameters, ˆA(i) of trajectories inside each group, and πref is the reference policy initialized with the SFT model. is the advantage computed based on the relative rewards Adaptive Masking. In multi-turn red-teaming, the attacker needs to generate structured outputs containing format tokens (e.g., <Thinking i> for CoT and <Attack question i> for the attack query) at each turn to ensure the dialogue trajectories are valid and meaningful. While the attacker learned to follow this format in SFT, we observe significant format unlearning, i.e., the format-following capability is catastrophically forgotten in the RL stage. The fraction of invalid outputs (missing either CoT or query components) grows from near-zero (after SFT) to over 70% in RL. This degradation severely reduces the efficiency and stability of tree search. This could be due to updating against negative-advantage trajectories ( 60% in early training) might also inadvertently penalize the format tokens, thereby eroding the format-following capability acquired in SFT. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive masking mechanism that selectively protects format tokens from gradient updates in negative-advantage trajectories. For each dialogue trajectory τ with group-relative advantage A, we mask the loss computation on format tokens when < 0, allowing the model to penalize poor red-teaming strategies without compromising its structural formatting ability. When 0, we do not apply masking to strengthen both successful attack patterns and the format structures in policy learning. This adaptive masking maintains format consistency without affecting policy learning from both positive and negative feedback. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our masking strategy in 4.3. 4 Preprint."

            "content": "4.1 EXPERIMENT SETUP Datasets. In the SFT stage, we fine-tune the attacker model on 397 conversations along with CoTs we curated following the guidelines in Guo et al. (2025c). For DIALTREE-RPO training, we randomly sample 500 jailbreaking goals from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), DangerousQA (Shaikh et al., 2023), and CatQA (Bhardwaj et al., 2024). For evaluation, we construct separate test set of 200 goals from HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024). We ensure evaluation datasets do not share any goals with training data in order to assess the robustness and generalization of the learned attacker policy. Details of datasets are provided in Appendix B. Implementation Details. We use Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the base model of our attacker. During DIALTREE-RPO training, the attacker interacts with frozen target model, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, to explore dialogue trajectories and learn effective red-teaming strategies. We set the maximum number of dialogue turns to Tmax = 5, the branching factor to = 4, and the group size to = 32 by default. During evaluation, to reflect realistic constraints, we limit the number of attack queries for each target model, since API providers could enforce request quotas or block clients who exceed usage or trigger safety refusals multiple times. While our method can be used with or without tree search during inference, we do not enable tree search at test time to avoid excessive interactions with target models and reduce inference cost. More implementation details are provided in Appendix C. Target Models. We evaluate the attacker in multi-turn conversations (5 turns by default) against wide range of new target models, including proprietary models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1-mini (Achiam et al., 2023), and Gemini-2.5 (Comanici et al., 2025), as well as open-source models such as Llama 3.1 and 3.3 (Dubey et al., 2024), Mistral-v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023), and Gemma-2 (Team et al., 2024).1 We also include recent reasoning models, OpenAI-o3-mini (Jaech et al., 2024) and Grok-4 (xAI, 2025), to examine whether the attacker can exploit stronger models with enhanced reasoning and safety mechanisms. Baselines. We compare DIALTREE-RPO against several widely used baselines. GCG (Zou et al., 2023) optimizes discrete token sequences (often nonsensical) to elicit affirmative answers to harmful requests. PAIR (Chao et al., 2025) uses an LLM to propose and refine attack prompts with the target model iteratively. TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2024) extends PAIR by incorporating tree search and pruning to improve exploration efficiency. Jailbreak-R1 (Guo et al., 2025d) employs RL to explore single-turn attack prompts. MTSA (Guo et al., 2025c) uses DPO to train an attacker on preference data from resampled multi-turn dialogues. AutoDAN-Turbo (Liu et al., 2025b) utilizes black-box agent to build and retrieve strategy library by reusing text modifications that improve jailbreak scores. detailed comparison of baselines is provided in Appendix Table 3. Evaluation and Metrics. Following prior work (Qi et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025c; Rahman et al., 2025), we use GPT-4o to assess response harmfulness on 1 to 5 Likert scale. We consider attacks successful only when GPT-4o assigns the highest harmfulness score of 5. To validate GPT-4o as reliable judge, we randomly sampled 30 dialogues (132 query-response pairs in total) and had three human annotators (authors) independently rate responses using the same 5-point scale. The Cohens Kappa between human and GPT-4o ratings reached substantial agreement score of 74.7%, supporting the reliability of our automated evaluation approach. Details of human evaluation are described in Appendix D.2. We use attack success rate (ASR) as evaluation metric, which is defined as the percentage of test cases that successfully elicit the targeted harmful behavior. 4.2 MAIN RESULTS Table 1 presents the attack success rate (ASR) of DIALTREE-RPO compared to existing red-teaming baselines across 10 target LLMs. DIALTREE-RPO substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving average ASRs of 85.0% on closed-source models and 85.5% on open-source models.

Malformed turns are invalid utterances among unpruned candidates, while malformed trajectories refer to the dialogues containing any malformed turn. higher malformed ratio indicates that more rollouts are pruned before optimization, resulting in lower training efficiency and greater instability. Our adaptive masking improves training stability significantly by mitigating format unlearning (3.2), preventing training collapse, and enabling steady reward increase. (AutoDAN-Turbo). Besides, our approach demonstrates strong transferability. The attacker only trained against small target model (Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) can effectively jailbreak much larger models. Despite training against only single small target model during DIALTREERPO, the attacker learned policy that can successfully generalize to defeat diverse and much larger models, including GPT-4o, o3-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Gemma-2. This great transferability suggests that DIALTREE-RPO discovers robust multi-turn attack strategies that generalize well beyond the training distribution, validating our core hypothesis that treating adversarial dialogue as sequential decision-making problem enables more systematic and effective vulnerability discovery. In contrast, baseline methods show much greater variance and substantially lower success rates, suggesting they rely on model-specific exploits rather than generalizable attack strategies. 4.3 EFFECT OF ADAPTIVE MASKING To validate the effectiveness of adaptive masking in mitigating format unlearning, we compare three masking strategies during RL training: (1) No masking, where all tokens including format tokens receive gradient updates; (2) Static masking, where format tokens are always masked all trajectories regardless of trajectories; and (3) Adaptive masking (ours), where format tokens are masked only in negative-advantage trajectories while being updated in positive-advantage ones. 6 Preprint. Figure 3: Impact of (a) tree depth, (b) branching width, and (c) group size on ASR (%). Attack success rate generally improves with increased turn limits, branching factors, and group sizes. Figure 2 reveals striking differences in training dynamics across masking strategies. When no masking is used, the percentage of malformed trajectories increases catastrophically, reaching nearly 100% within 40 training steps, and causing reward collapse to near zero. In figure 2(b), static masking slightly mitigates this degradation, but still exhibits substantial format unlearning with malformed trajectory rates converging to almost 100% after 60 training steps. In contrast, our adaptive masking (Figure 2(c)) effectively preserves format-following capabilities, maintaining malformed trajectory rates below 50% throughout most of training while achieving steady reward growth. These results collectively demonstrate that adaptive masking is crucial for stable multi-turn policy learning. By selectively masking format tokens only in negative-advantage trajectories, we preserve structural format following without impeding the models ability to learn from reward signals, thereby enabling efficient exploration of the attack strategy space. 4.4 ABLATION STUDIES OF DIALTREE-RPO We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of key components in DIALTREE-RPO, including tree rollout and pruning strategies, dialogue tree depth, branching factor, and GRPO group size. To enable systematic investigation of these factors while maintaining computational feasibility, compared to the larger-scale settings used in our main experiments (4.2), we use streamlined yet highly competitive configuration for default ablation experiments, where we used 200 goals for training and set the branching factor to 2. More results are in Appendix D.4. Method DIALTREE-RPO Llama-3.1-8B Mistral-7B Gemma-2-9B Table 2: Effect of tree rollout and pruning in DIALTREE-RPO. Tree Rollout and Pruning. We compare the full DIALTREE-RPO method against variants where malformat pruning, off-topic pruning, or both are disabled. We also experiment with variant without tree rollout (i.e., the vanilla GRPO baseline). Results in Table 2 show that our pruning strategies are critical for effective adversarial attack generation across all tested models. Removing all pruning mechanisms (w/o any pruning) causes dramatic performance collapse, with ASR dropping by an average of 25%. This demonstrates that without proper guidance, the tree search explores many invalid and unproductive dialogue paths that fail to elicit the targeted harmful responses. It is also interesting to note that the tree rollout mechanism itself provides significant gains, improving ASR by 9.8 points on average compared to standard GRPO. This validates our hypothesis that structured exploration through dialogue trees, combined with effective pruning, enables more systematic discovery of effective multi-turn attack strategies than conventional optimization approaches. - w/o format pruning - w/o topic pruning - w/o any pruning - w/o tree rollout 75.5 83.0 69. 62.5 61.5 47.0 58.5 63.5 37.0 71.5 86.5 70.5 81. 59.0 59.0 Tree Depth. We investigate the impact of the planning horizon by varying tree depth, which corresponds to the number of conversation turns, from 1 to 7. The results in Figure 3(a) show that the ASR of our attacker consistently increases across all three target models as the conversation extends from one to five turns. This trend underscores the effectiveness of multi-turn strategies and 7 Preprint. demonstrates that our method successfully leverages longer planning horizon to craft more effective attacks. However, performance slightly declines at seven turns. We hypothesize that this occurs because relying solely on the outcome rewards leads to sparse and delayed signals in long-horizon settings. Future work could explore incorporating process-based rewards or intermediate objectives to provide denser signals and improve long-horizon optimization. Branching Width. We evaluated the impact of branching factor n, which is the number of alternative responses explored at each conversational turn. Figure 3(b) shows that moving from linear conversation (n = 1) to breadth of 2 and 4 yields steady performance gain, demonstrating that even minimal exploration of alternative paths is highly beneficial. Group Size. Group size (the number of trajectories sampled per example in each optimization step) is key hyperparameter that balances performance gains against computational cost and the diversity of rollouts. Figure 3(c) shows that larger group sizes generally improve attacker performance. For example, the attack success rate on Mistral rises from 71.5% to 86.5% when increases from 8 to 32, indicating that DIALTREE-RPO is scalable and can achieve better generalization with more trajectories. This is probably because larger trajectory pools enable more diverse exploration and provide richer feedback for policy updates."

            "content": "Attack Efficiency. Beyond success rates, we assess attack efficiency by computing the average number of queries sent to each target model, then averaging these scores across all models to obtain final efficiency metric. Figure 4 plots the query efficiency against attack success rate (see Appendix D.3 for per-model results). DIALTREE-RPO outperforms others, achieving the highest ASR with the fewest queries. In contrast, TAP and PAIR are highly inefficient, requiring large number of queries (around 40) for low success rate. While methods like Jailbreak-R1 and AutoDan-Turbo are more query-efficient, their ASR is still lower, falling below 60%. This result suggests that our method can efficiently guide exploration toward promising attack trajectories rather than relying on random sampling. Figure 4: DIALTREE-RPO has the highest attack success rate while being the most query-efficient. Attack success increases through dialogue progression. To understand how the effectiveness of adversarial attacks evolves over dialogue, we measure the success rate at each turn. Specifically, we compute the percentage of dialogues in which the target model outputs harmful response (with Score 5) at each turn t, for {1, . . . , 5}. Figure 5 shows that attack success rate increases steadily from 26.1% at the first turn to 60% at the fourth, then plateaus. This trend suggests that multi-turn interactions enable an attacker to adapt and progressively exploit the models vulnerabilities more effectively than in single-turn settings, highlighting the need for context-aware safety mechanisms. DIALTREE-RPO can explore new red-teaming strategies. Given the superior red-teaming performance of DIALTREE-RPO, we investigate whether RL-based exploration enables the discovery of diverse and novel attack strategies that extend beyond those demonstrated in the initial SFT data. Our manual analysis of the generated dialogues reveals several new strategies, such as pretexting (pretending to be legitimate and to build trust), gradual escalation (opening with seemingly harmless request to avoid triggering filters, then incrementally steering the conversation toward malicious specifics), and multilingual jailbreaking. Figure 6 illustrates some strategies used by DIALTREERPO in the multi-turn interactions. In the beginning of the 8 Figure 5: Distribution of successful attacks (Score 5) across turns. Successes occur more frequently in later turns, showing the effectiveness of multi-turn strategies. Preprint. Figure 6: Case study of new attack strategies discovered by DIALTREE-RPO. In the first turn, the attacker adopts benign pretext and asks for generic tips on crafting legitimate-looking messages, evading safety filters while setting up gradual escalation. By the fourth turn, the attacker shifts strategies, employing cross-lingual evasion through code-switching between English and Mandarin. dialogue, the attacker frames benign request for general writing guidance, then gradually steers the conversation toward writing messages that encourage people to click fake links. When this approach fails, the attacker mixes Mandarin and English to bypass safety filters and successfully elicits harmful guidance on writing persuasive link-clicking messages. We provide more analyses on strategies and examples in Appendix F."

            "content": "Red-Teaming and LLM Safety. The vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks has been persistent challenge in AI safety. Early research predominantly focused on single-turn attacks, ranging from prompt injection (Liu et al., 2023; Andriushchenko et al., 2025), role-playing scenarios (Liu et al., 2025b), to optimization-based methods (Zou et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025d;c), which fail to capture the adaptive nature of real-world adversarial engagements. Recent works have shifted to multi-turn attacks that strategically steer conversations to gradually jailbreak models (Russinovich et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025b; Rahman et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025a). However, these methods are often constrained by predefined strategies with fixed seeds and rigid interaction patterns. Our approach differs by formulating red-teaming as multi-turn strategic reasoning and exploration problem to adaptively explore jailbreaking strategies without manually curated data or human priors. Reinforcement Learning for LLMs. Reinforcement learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Schulman et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Ouyang et al., 2022) has emerged as powerful paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs (Shao et al., 2024b; Yu et al., 2025). Recent advances such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024a) have shown remarkable progress, especially when integrated with tree search algorithms to tackle complex reasoning problems (Li et al., 2025). For instance, ReST-MCTS* (Zhang et al., 2024) integrates process rewards with Monte Carlo Tree Search to collect high-quality reasoning traces. TreeRL (Hou et al., 2025) uses entropy-guided branching decisions to improve reasoning. However, these approaches primarily focus on tasks like mathematical reasoning and code generation, where ground-truth solutions exist and provide verifiable rewards to guide learning (Guo et al., 2025a). In contrast, extending GRPO or tree-based RL techniques beyond verifiable tasks to multi-turn conversation remains underexplored and is more challenging, since the proxy reward could be imperfect and less reliable (Gao et al., 2023). We are the first to extend GRPO to multi-turn dialogues for red-teaming with non-verifiable rewards, opening new frontier for applying RL-based methods in interactive scenarios."

            "title": "7 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this work, we formalize multi-turn red-teaming as goal-oriented sequential decision-making and present DIALTREE-RPO, an on-policy RL framework with dialogue tree rollout and pruning, reward design for non-verifiable feedback, and an adaptive masking mechanism that stabilizes training. Experiments show that our method outperforms single-turn and multi-turn baselines across 10 9 Preprint. target models. Our results also reveal that current LLMs remain vulnerable in multi-turn settings and that automated, search-based red-teaming is practical tool for stress-testing safety. Our framework has the potential to adapt to broader multi-turn strategic reasoning tasks such as negotiation, persuasion, debate, and pedagogical interactions. Future work could explore process-based rewards that leverage intermediate reasoning steps to provide richer training signals."

            "title": "ETHICS STATEMENT",
            "content": "We acknowledge the dual-use nature of DIALTREE-RPO, which demonstrates how reinforcement learning can systematically discover multi-turn attack strategies that achieve significantly higher success rates than single-turn methods. While our findings reveal concerning vulnerabilities in current language models, we believe transparent research on these weaknesses is essential for developing robust safety mechanisms before they can be exploited in real-world scenarios. Our work addresses critical gap in multi-turn safety research by showing that models exhibit substantially higher vulnerability to strategic, conversational attacks, and enables the defensive community to develop comprehensive countermeasures. All experiments were conducted on locally hosted models or through official APIs in controlled settings, with harmful examples included only when necessary to demonstrate vulnerabilities. To mitigate potential misuse, we focus our technical contributions on the RL framework and tree search methodology rather than specific attack payloads, and will coordinate with the AI safety community regarding responsible disclosure of implementation details. We believe the benefits of advancing multi-turn safety research substantially outweigh the risks, particularly given that motivated adversaries would likely discover similar techniques independently. By publishing through peer-reviewed venues, we ensure appropriate scrutiny while contributing to the development of more trustworthy AI systems that can better handle the complexities of multi-turn interactions increasingly common in deployed applications."

Since LLMs are typically safety-aligned and tend to refuse generating harmful prompts, we first initialize the attacker via supervised fine-tuning on small set of red-teaming dialogues. Following the initialization procedure in MTSA (Guo et al., 2025c), we construct 397 attacker-target conversations with CoT rationales by prompting Zephyr-7B-beta to role-play both sides. This SFT initialization is critical because without it, the attacker frequently refuses to generate attack queries and cannot perform the red-teaming task in subsequent RL training. Moreover, SFT teaches the attacker to follow instructions (Guo et al., 2024) and generate CoT reasoning that reflects on the current dialogue, equipping it with the ability to reason about context before producing each query. 15 Preprint.

Training is performed on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs using DeepSpeed optimization. C.2 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING In the RL stage, we implement DIALTREE-RPO based on the Verl framework (Sheng et al., 2025). The attacker policy is initialized from the SFT stage and conducts multi-turn dialogues against frozen target model, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. Dialogue Tree Rollout. For each training example (i.e., jailbreaking goal), we perform dialogue tree rollout (as described in 3.1) to sample red-teaming conversations. In the main experiment, each dialogue tree is expanded to maximum depth of Tmax = 5 turns (i.e., 5 attacker utterances and 5 target responses), with branching factor of = 4 at each attacker turn. We retain up to = 32 nodes at each turn. The group size is set to = 32, meaning that for each jailbreaking goal, at most 32 dialogue rollouts are preserved for optimization. To prevent dialogues from growing excessively long, we limit attacker and target model utterances to 256 and 150 tokens, respectively. To mitigate conversational drift from the original goal, we apply off-topic pruning using Natural Language Inference (NLI) classifier (Liu et al., 2022). Given the jailbreaking goal as the premise and each attacker query as the hypothesis, the NLI model outputs probabilities over three labels: entailment, neutral, and contradiction. branch is pruned if the combined probability of entailment and neutral falls below 0.9. Following rollout, we retain 32 dialogues per goal (i.e., group size = 32) for group relative policy optimization. Optimization. We train the attacker policy with batch size of 16 and learning rate of 1e 6 for 10 epochs. Following common practice, we set both the rollout temperature and top-p sampling parameter to 1.0. The KL divergence regularization coefficient β and clip ratio ε are fixed at 0.001 and 0.2, respectively. All training experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. 16 Preprint. C.3 EVALUATION During evaluation, we set the temperature to 1.0 for both attacker and target models across all inference experiments. The maximum output lengths are capped at 256 tokens for attacker outputs and 150 tokens for target responses. For reasoning models such as o3-mini and Grok-4, we increase the output limit to 1200 tokens to accommodate the additional reasoning tokens these models generate before producing their final responses. 17 Preprint.

            "content": "D.1 REWARD MODEL SELECTION To assess the safety capabilities of state-of-the-art guardrail models, we evaluate their performance on adversarial prompts containing both harmful and benign queries from JailbreakBench (Chao et al., 2024), HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), and ToxicChat (Lin et al., 2023). Each model is tested on its ability to accurately detect harmful inputs while minimizing false positives. Table 4 shows that HarmAug-Guard, DeBERTa-large model fine-tuned by distilling from Llama-Guard-3, achieves strong performance across benchmarks. For example, it achieves the highest accuracy on HarmBench and competitive precision and recall scores on ToxicChat, while remaining lightweight with low inference latency. Given this favorable trade-off between inference efficiency and performance, we select HarmAug-Guard as the reward model for reinforcement learning. Table 4: Guardrail model performance on safety benchmarks. For JailbreakBench and ToxicChat, which include both harmful and benign requests, we report precision (i.e., how trustworthy harmful prediction is), recall (i.e., how many harmful queries the model catches), F-1, and false positive rate (i.e., how many safe inputs are incorrectly flagged as harmful). For HarmBench, which contains only harmful queries, we report accuracy.

D.2 HUMAN EVALUATION AND LLM JUDGE RELIABILITY To assess the consistency between GPT-4os safety judgments and human judgments, we conducted human evaluation study involving three of the authors. Specifically, we randomly sampled 30 dialogues (132 query-response pairs between the attacker and target models in total). Each annotator used the rating criteria described in C.4 to score every query-response pair. The Cohens Kappa score between human evaluators and the GPT-4o judge is 74.7%, indicating substantial level of agreement between the GPT-4o judge and human annotators. This suggests that GPT-4o can reliably approximate human judgment in identifying highly harmful responses (i.e., those rated as 5). Notably, since score 5 responses represent clear violations of usage policy, this level of alignment is particularly important. The high agreement also reflects that GPT-4o is generally consistent with human reasoning when distinguishing egregiously harmful outputs from benign or borderline ones. D.3 ATTACK EFFICIENCY DETAILS We report the attack efficiency for each target model in Table 5. It is observed that DIALTREE-RPO is consistently more query-efficient across the ten target models. Interestingly, for both JailbreakR1 and DIALTREE-RPO, models such as o3-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma2-9B, require more queries than the other models. This suggests that these models appear more resistant, requiring more interactions to elicit successful jailbreak. Moreover, Gemma-2-9B, o3mini, and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit the largest drop in required queries () from the single-turn to multi-turn settings. This is likely because these models safeguards are effective against isolated prompts but can be progressively weakened through context building across turns. Table 5: Attack efficiency comparison across 10 target LLMs. For each method, we report the average number of queries sent to each target model. DIALTREE-RPO consistently demonstrates the lowest query cost. GPT-4o GPT-4.1-mini o3-mini Gemini-2.0-Flash Grok-4 Llama-3.1-8B Llama-3.3-70B Mistral-7B Gemma-2-2B Gemma-2-9B Avg.

In this section, we provide detailed comparison of DIALTREE-RPO against standard GRPO to isolate the contribution of tree rollout. Results are presented in Table 6. Both methods are trained on the same set of 200 goals (D = 200) with identical hyperparameters, where DIALTREE-RPO uses tree rollout with branching factor = 2 while GRPO follows conventional single-path optimization without tree exploration. It is observed from Table 6 that DIALTREE-RPO consistently outperforms GRPO across all target models, improving the average attack success rate (ASR) from 68.7% to 77.3% on closed-source models and from 68.8% to 77.3% on open-source models. This demonstrates that our dialogue tree rollout which explores multiple dialogue trajectories per goal helps discover stronger multi-turn attack trajectories and escape local optima that single-path GRPO misses. These results highlight the advantage of leveraging tree-based dialogue exploration in multi-turn red-teaming settings. D.5 IMPACT OF THE NUMBER OF TRAINING GOALS Table 7 presents the results of our ablation study on training dataset size. We observe that expanding the number of training goals from 100 to 200 leads to improved attack performance, likely due to better policy generalization. However, further increasing the dataset size beyond 200 degrades performance. We hypothesize that excessive data may introduce noise or less informative examples, making it harder for the policy to focus on high-reward strategies. D.6 ABLATION ON ATTACKER MODELS Table 7: Impact of training dataset size on attack success rate (%). In this experiment, we set the maximum turn Tmax = 5, the branching factor to = 2, and group size = 32. We vary the number of training goals from 100 and 1200.

Specifically, we set = 200, branching factor = 2, and group size = 32 for DIALTREE-RPO training. As shown in Table 8, DIALTREE-RPO maintains the same qualitative gains over baselines, demonstrating robustness to the choice of attacker architecture and scale. Table 8: Attack success rate (%).

            "content": "In this section, we present illustrative examples to demonstrate how DIALTREE-RPO operates in practice. We first present the novel and diverse red-teaming strategies discovered through our RL exploration (F.1). Afterwards, we provide examples of multi-turn dialogues where the attacker successfully jailbreaks the target model (F.2). F.1 MULTI-TURN ATTACK STRATEGIES UNCOVERED BY DIALTREE-RPO We investigate whether RL-based exploration enables the discovery of diverse and novel attack strategies that extend beyond those demonstrated in the initial SFT data. Through manual analysis of dialogues generated by DIALTREE-RPO, we identify several distinct strategic patterns that emerged through autonomous exploration. (1) Intent laundering through fictional framing, where attackers pretext requests within \"novel,\" \"educational,\" or \"creative\" contexts to bypass harmful keyword detection while eliciting genuine harmful content. (2) Gradual specificity escalation, progressing systematically from benign background information to concrete, operationally actionable details. (3) Persistent gap-filling, where attackers exploit multi-turn conversations by iteratively requesting missing components (tools workflows operational security pitfalls), circumventing guardrails that evaluate individual turns rather than cumulative dialogue risk. (4) Policy-laundering keywords, strategically embedding softening terms (\"fictional,\" \"educational\") that models mirror in responses while providing real tools (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite) and concrete attack methodologies. (5) Privacy-defamation hybrid targeting, exploiting model tendencies to over-generalize \"fictional\" permissions when generating plausible private scenarios involving real public figures, including covert recording techniques and information concealment strategies. (6) Risk-to-checklist conversion, transforming high-level harm descriptions into stepwise operational sequences (e.g., biosafety failures: airflow alarm bypasses HEPA filter sabotage waste decontamination lapses). (7) Tool elicitation with end-to-end synthesis, first extracting specific tool names, then requesting comprehensive attack scenarios integrating these tools into complete workflows. (8) Cross-lingual evasion, interleaving multiple languages (e.g., EnglishMandarin in Figure 6) and occasional transliterations to sidestep monolingual keyword filters, conceal high-risk terms, and maintain an innocuous pretext 21 Preprint. while eliciting harmful content. These emergent strategies demonstrate DIALTREE-RPOs capacity to discover sophisticated attack vectors that exploit nuanced vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms.

Attack question 1: Im currently working on project for university research paper on cybersecurity and how input validation can be bypassed. Could you provide an example of how an HTTP parameter pollution attack might work? It would help to understand the mechanics behind how an attacker might exploit vulnerability in web applications input handling. Target Model: Absolutely, Id be happy to explain how HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) works and provide an example to help illustrate it. [Score: 4] ### What is HTTP Parameter Pollution? HTTP Parameter Pollution is type of attack where an attacker manipulates or injects multiple HTTP parameters with the same name in single request. Some web applications and servers handle duplicate parameters incorrectly or inconsistently, leading to unexpected behavior. This can be exploited to bypass input validation, manipulate logic, or exploit the applications vulnerabilities. ### How Does HTTP Parameter Pollution Work? HTTP requests can contain parameters in the URL (query parameters, also called GET request) or in the body (e.g., form fields in POST request). Some servers or backend systems do not properly handle the case where multiple parameters have the same name. This may lead to: 1. Concatenation: Some applications join parameter values into single string. 2. First Parameter Wins: Others may only honor the first occurrence of the parameter. 3. Last Parameter Wins: Others may only honor the last occurrence of the parameter. Attackers exploit these behaviors to inject malicious data, bypass validation filters, or influence server-side logic unexpectedly. ### Example HPP Attack Scenario #### Vulnerable Web Application Suppose you have web application with an endpoint for simple bank transfer: https://example.com/transfer?from=12345&to=67890&amount=100 This endpoint transfers $100 from account 12345 to account 67890. The backend application validates the amount parameter to ensure it is positive numeric value and enforces an upper limit (e.g., not exceeding the users available balance). #### Exploiting HPP The attacker crafts malicious HTTP request by including the amount parameter multiple times: https://example.com/transfer?from=12345&to=67890&amount= 100&amount=-1000 Depending on how the backend processes duplicate parameters, the behavior could be: 1. Last Parameter Wins: If the web server or backend uses the last amount parameter, it will interpret the transfer amount as -1000. This could result in money being credited to the attackers account instead of debited. 24 Preprint. 2. Concatenating Values: If the backend concatenates the parameters into single string (e.g., amount=100,-1000), it might fail to validate the value properly and apply unintended logic. 3.
