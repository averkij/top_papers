Visual features shape human choices, and thus, the images around us are often designed to capture human attention. Now there is new class of viewers: Agents making consequential vi1 Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? sual decisions at scalewhich product to buy (Yao et al., 2022), which resume to shortlist (Lo et al., 2025), or perhaps even what real estate to consider (Graham, 2025). Many of these decisions are preference-based, and they are delegated under an implicit assumption of shared visual values, i.e., an agents choice likely aligns with what person would choose or what is in their best interest. When this assumption is violated, the consequences of these decisions can compound, potentially shifting visual culture toward their preferences rather than ours. Even when this assumption holds in aggregate, it can mask an important fragility: both humans and agents can potentially be steered by superficial but plausible presentation changes, and in automated settings these shifts can scale rapidly across platforms. Importantly, if such sensitivities exist, they may be discovered eventually: either implicitly through competitive pressures or explicitly by adversarial actors. We need methods that can surface and characterize these preferences before they are exploited at scale. Nevertheless, current evaluations of VLMs (Lee et al., 2024) focus almost entirely on accuracy: can they identify objects, answer questions, follow visual instructions? But accuracy tells us only one part of the story. Agents are highly sensitive (often more so than humans) to textual nudges (Cherep et al., 2025b; 2024) and other contextual attributes (Cherep et al., 2025a), and these behaviors shape outcomes in ways accuracy benchmarks alone cannot capture. In short, behavioral systems require behavioral tests (Cherep et al., 2025c). Measuring agentic preferences is not straightforward. Naively, one could collect large dataset of images with natural variation in visual attributes (e.g. lighting, background) and run exhaustive pairwise choice experiments, hoping that the dataset spans the relevant dimensions and that enough trials will reveal patterns. This brute-force approach is expensive, slow, and offers no guarantee of coverage. The space of possible visual features is vast, and naturally occurring variation may not probe which features actually matter. We introduce method that treats the agents decision function as visual utility landscape that can be explored through optimizing image edits. Crucially, these are not adversarial perturbations but more naturalistic transformations typically without deceptive intent. Our approach starts from candidate image and uses text-to-image editing model to iteratively modify it using feedback guidance. Constraining edits to preserve semantic content, ensuring the main element remains recognizable as the original, helps isolate primarily visual factors and discover which ones most reliably shift agentic choices. We validate this approach through large-scale choice experiments over multiple datasets on frontier VLMs and human participants. We find that targeted edits can substantially increase selection probability, revealing recurring visual themes that we extract using an automatic interpretability pipeline. Importantly, this approach offers new methodology for studying the implicit value functions embedded in vision-based AI systems. Overall, this work contributes: 1. Empirical evidence of visual sensitivities significantly affecting VLMs decisions, even from zero-shot edits by an image generation model. 2. new competition-based visual prompt optimization method (CVPO) that can systematically exploit these sensitivities, further biasing VLMs judgments. 3. Adaptations of two existing algorithms, TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) and Feedback Descent (Lee et al., 2025), to the visual prompt optimization task. 4. benchmark of the sensitivities of 9 frontier VLMs under both the zero-shot and optimized images in 2alternative forced choice scenarios across 4 realistic agentic tasks, including product purchasing, candidate hiring, house searching, and vacation hotel scouting. 5. Evidence from online experiments (N =154) that modified images also significantly shift human choices. 6. An auto-interpretability method that hierarchically surfaces trends and features which the optimization discovers to influence VLMs judgments. 7. Experiments showing that visual normalization (attempting to align contextual features of candidate images before deciding) partially mitigates vulnerabilities, but not completely. Though this presents promising path towards solution, it also raises important concerns about the robustness of VLM agents in real-world decisions. 2. Related Work Often, benchmarks for evaluating models such as VLMs and agents are functional; that is, they focus on evaluations of task competence (e.g. Yao et al. (2022); Zhou et al. (2023)). In contrast, this work places focus on behavioral evaluation; that is, we seek to study model behaviors and the inputs that drive them, in an effort to better scientifically understand the reasons for their successes, failures, and real-world consequences (Cherep et al., 2025c). Recent evaluations have begun to take this approach, such as the Anthropic Bloom toolkit (Gupta et al., 2025). One way that such behavioral evaluations have helped us understand models better is by illuminating their sensitivities, or the inputs that systematically distort their behavior 2 Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? in ways that deviate from our expectations (for example, if we assume rational behavior as default). Such evaluations have, in the LLM agent world, illuminated how factors like psychological nudges and item attributes like prices and ratings can substantively influence such agents decisions (Cherep et al., 2024; 2025b;a; Brucks & Toubia, 2023; Sclar et al., 2023). As these agents now often make use of visual information (Zhai et al., 2024; Grigsby et al., 2025), it is imperative that we understand in turn how such stimuli might similarly evoke sensitivities in behavior. Some prior work has, for instance, conducted detailed studies of VLMs (Lee et al., 2024) in terms of their understanding of shape vs. texture (Gavrikov et al., 2024), numerosity (Budny et al., 2025), and feature binding (Campbell et al., 2024), among other lenses. Very recently, visual attribute reliance has also been extensively studied in recognition tasks (Li et al., 2025). Our work inherits this diagnostic lens, but we focus on sensitivity of agent-like decisions to visual properties of inputs, seeking to understand how decisions change when such visual properties change. Another line of work we draw on is that concerning adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2023). These are inputs that are perturbed to produce different choices, where such perturbation is typically perceptually insignificant to humans and uncorrelated to the task. By contrast, we focus on perceptually salient visual characteristics, and indeed, we test them on humans too. This then brings us to the question of method. How can we systematically search for, discover, and interpret such sensitivities? Here, we draw on the emerging literature on prompt optimization (Pryzant et al., 2023) methods. These techniques, such as TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025), Feedback Descent (Lee et al., 2025), and GEPA (Agrawal et al., 2025), seek to optimize textual artifacts to find optima of arbitrary objective functions. In particular, TextGrad and Feedback Descent accomplish this by using natural language feedback as an approximation to gradient; direction for proposals to improve the artifact. Some work has also applied this basic principle to text-to-image generation with, for example, scoring rubrics (Manas et al., 2024). Very recently (concurrently), Maestro (Wan et al., 2025) and MPO (Choi et al., 2025) propose extending feedback-driven prompt optimization methods into the multimodal domain. We similarly extend the feedback gradient principle to the multimodal setting, in our case optimizing image editing prompts via feedback process driven by agent-like decisions. This is largely enabled by major recent advances in the controllability of visual generative models, such as Gemini 2.5 and 3 image models, codenamed Nano Banana, and Qwen-Image-Edit (Wu et al., 2025). The precise visual control they offer, combined with the power of extending the feedback-driven optimization paradigm, enables the systematic approach we will discuss. This also aligns conceptually with iterative preference elicitation methods (e.g. Handa et al. (2024)). Concurrent work has studied visual sensitivities of web agents to design parameters by systematic variation (Yu et al., 2026), which complements our study on naturalistic image variations obtained via optimization. The last task is thus one of interpretation. Given set of optimized images that influence VLMs decisions, how do we understand what about them creates this effect? To solve this, we draw on auto-interpretability (Bills et al., 2023; Perez et al., 2023; Paulo et al., 2024), set of recent techniques for repurposing language models interpretive capacities to make sense of arbitrary groups of artifacts, such as, in our case, optimized and original images. We assemble these components into pipeline that can reliably discover visual changes that substantively change VLMs decisions, offering deeper lens into their behavioral properties. 3. Methods 3.1. Data We use four datasets relevant to tasks vision-language agents might be instructed to assist with in real-world scenarios: product purchasing, house searching, job candidate screening, and hotel scouting (e.g. for booking travel). Each dataset consists of set of initial images and task-specific objective that can be evaluated by VLM-based critic. For each dataset, we sample 100 images in total to go through all our optimization and evaluation procedures. Products are sampled from the Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) dataset (Collins et al., 2022), across 20 popular categories. Houses are sampled from dataset for house price estimation (Ahmed & Moustafa, 2016), wherein we sought comparable images by sampling houses within 1 2 standard deviation of the mean price and then randomly subsampling to 100. The images of people were synthetic, from StyleGAN-Human (Fu et al., 2022). Finally, the hotel images consisted of both rooms and lobbies and were drawn from prior work investigating effects of hotel images aesthetic properties (Cuesta-Valino et al., 2023). We preprocess all these images by upscaling them with 1:1 aspect ratio via the image editing model Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) to serve as comparable starting points; these images then constitute the original versions. 3.2. Visual Prompt Optimization We study visual prompt optimization: an iterative procedure for constructing naturalistic image edits that measurably shift VLMs judgments in task-defined direction, while preserving the identity of the underlying visual object or scene. The object of optimization is not the image pixels directly, but rather an editable text prompt that parameterizes an image-editing operator. See Figure 1 for the pipeline. 3 Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? Objects and objective. Let x0 denote an original image (e.g. product photo, house exterior shot, candidate portrait, or hotel room). Let be the space of prompt strings. We assume access to an image-editing model prompt update and (ii) evaluating the resulting edited image. Let pt denote the editable prompt at iteration and xt = x(pt) the corresponding image. generic loop is: Edit : , (1) x(p) := Edit(x0, p) is the edited image induced by prompt p. In practice we use base prior prompt p0 that encodes an intuitive initial prompt to produce zero-shot versions (e.g. keep the same product and make the image more appealing); we then optimize the residual editing prompt and apply the composed prompt = Compose(p0, p), but we omit this distinction in this section for clarity. task is specified by instructions τ (e.g. choose the better product) and an evaluator (a VLM) that induces binary preference over pairs. We treat the evaluator as defining latent utility landscape over images, and our goal is to find prompt such that the edited image x(p) has higher utility than the baseline. generic constrained formulation is max pP Uτ (x(p)) s.t. x(p) C(x0) (2) where C(x0) is constraint set for identity maintenance. This may be implemented differently per algorithms (e.g. as an explicit check vs. approximately, as an instruction), but the goal is that allowable changes are semanticspreserving and visually plausible and can adjust controllable attributes such as background, lighting, framing, color palette, or contextual props and other mutable elements of the visual scene. Preference-based evaluation. In many settings we do not assume calibrated scalar Uτ (x); instead we observe pairwise judgments. Let Jτ (xa, xb) {a, b, } be an evaluator that returns winner (a/b) or to indicate an unusable outcome (e.g. inconsistent judgments under order-reversal that avoids positional biases). This induces an empirical preference relation xa τ xb when Jτ consistently selects xa over xb. common probabilistic view is Bradley Terry/Luce-style model: P(xa τ xb) = σ(Uτ (xa) Uτ (xb)) (3) with σ as logistic link. Under this view, increasing choice probability in head-to-head comparisons corresponds to increasing utility gap. Visual prompt optimization can thus be cast as repeatedly proposing and accepting it when the induced image x(p) wins against the incumbent. Optimization loop as model-based search. Abstractly, visual prompt optimization alternates between (i) proposing 4 (cid:16) pt+1 Π pt, Ht (cid:17) , xt+1 = x(pt+1) accept if xt+1 τ xt (4) (5) where Ht is some (implementation-dependent) representation of the optimization history, and Π is proposal operator implemented by text model, heuristic rule, or learned policy. Then, the selection is similar to Bandits under noisy preferences in that evaluator judgments are stochastic and can be order-sensitive. robust procedure must therefore use repeated comparisons, order counterbalancing, and conservative acceptance rules to reduce false improvements. Identity constraints. central requirement is that optimization modifies presentation rather than what the thing is. We operationalize this by encouraging edits to remain within an identity-preserving set. Definition 3.1 (Identity maintenance). Fix an original image x0 and an identity predicate I(, ) {0, 1} that tests whether two images depict the same underlying entity/scene up to allowed nuisance variation. The identity-preserving constraint set is C(x0) := {x : I(x, x0) = 1}. (6) procedure is identity-maintaining if it produces sequence {xt}t0 with xt C(x0) for all t. The predicate can be implemented by post-hoc checks (e.g. prompting VLM to verify invariants and reject violating proposals), similarity thresholds, or approximated via simple verbal instructions in the editing instructions. In practice, with sufficiently controllable editing model Edit, we find that simple instructions suffice. We use Nano Banana, which generally obeys this constraint expressed via prompting. Without such constraints, the optimizer can trivially improve utility by changing the underlying object (e.g. swapping the product), confounding any interpretation of visual preferences. Stopping and equilibrium. Because the evaluator is noisy and the edit model is imperfect, the process should terminate when additional proposals fail to yield consistent improvements. In practice, stopping can be expressed as either patience rule (no accepted improvements for rounds) or an approximate equilibrium condition in paired contests. In the utility view (3), equilibrium corresponds to local flatness: for proposals in the neighborhood induced by Π, the induced utility gap Uτ (x(p)) Uτ (x(pt)) is near zero in expectation, so win rates concentrate near 50%. Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? What visual prompt optimization buys us. The goal of this framework is to convert static preference judgments into controlled intervention process: we start from fixed identity x0, search over plausible presentations of x0 via prompt-mediated edits, and record which changes increase selection probability under agent-motivated task instructions. The resulting optimized prompts and images serve two roles in the paper: (i) as measurement device for mapping parts of VLMs visual utility landscape, and (ii) as inputs to downstream analyses that extract recurring visual factors associated with this increased probability of choice. 3.3. Specific Optimization Methods VisualTextGrad (VTG) adapts the text-based gradient method from TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) to the visual domain by treating the editable portion of the prompt as differentiable textual object. At each iteration, an LLM critic scores the current state under task-specific instructions, produces structured feedback, and then induces an update direction that is aggregated over brief history. Prompt updates are projected onto constraint set to enforce identity maintenance (e.g. of the original product). VisualFeedbackDescent (VFD) is based on the very recent Feedback Descent method (Lee et al., 2025) and follows proposal-and-evaluation loop. proposer model generates candidate prompt edit conditioned on prior winners and the current best solution. This proposal is then applied to the image and then evaluated via comparison against the incumbent image, with order randomization used to detect and discard inconsistent judgments up to attempts (k = 3 in our experiments). Accepted improvements reset the feedback history, and repeated rejections trigger early stopping via patience criterion. We detail the full VTG and VFD algorithms in Appendix B. Finally, CVPO (shown in Algorithm 1) is our novel method that frames visual prompt optimization as competitive selection process between two candidates evaluated by panel of judges. In each round, judges vote via pairwise comparisons with consistency checks (k = 3 in our experiments). The losing prompt is refined by generating multiple challengers informed by judge feedback and optimization history, after which local contest selects replacement. The process terminates when votes approach equilibrium between the two strongest local candidates, indicating no clear advantage between competitors. All prompts are in Appendix H. Note: we use Gemini 3 Flash as the judge model in all optimization pipelines. 3.4. Evaluation When evaluating, we pass the pair of images along with task-specific instructions to each VLM and ask it to make choice (all models use their default temperature; prompts [ ] (votes); [ ] (feedback) for each judge Jj do Algorithm 1 Competitive Visual Prompt Optimization (CVPO) Require: original image x0, base prior P0, judges {Jj}, max rounds , equilibrium threshold ϵ, min rounds Tmin, candidates 1: pA ; pB 2: xA Edit(Compose(P0, pA), x0) 3: xB Edit(Compose(P0, pA), x0, xA) 4: for = 1 to do 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: (wAB, rAB) Jj([xA, xB]) (wBA, rBA) Jj([xB, xA]) if wAB = wBA then end if end for argmax V V if Tmin and 0.5 < ϵ then break (equilibrium reached) {wAB}; {rAB} end if (pW , xW ) (w = A) ? (pA, xA) : (pB, xB) (pL, xL) (w = A) ?

We then repeat this with the order of the images reversed to avoid order bias. When the decision from the evaluator VLM on the same pair is inconsistent depending on order, we mark this as inconsistent, to be discarded or evaluated separately in downstream analyses. We first compare images pairwise between original, zeroshot edited, and final (optimized) versions, within each category (for hotels and products) or generally, excluding self-comparisons (any version of an image against itself). We repeat this for each of the three optimization methods (VTG, VFD, and CVPO). Then, we put the final optimized images from each method in head-to-head comparison against each other using similar pairwise scheme avoiding self-comparisons. We analyze results using linear probability models (LPMs) on the binary outcomes of choosing an image or not, with estimated marginal means (EMMs) and post-hoc contrasts for ease of interpretation (full model specifications are given in Appendix E.2). 5 Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? 3.5. Interpretability We use multi-stage automated interpretability pipeline to make sense of the realized visual changes. First, we prompt VLM with the original and final edited images to reason about the visible differences between them. This provides initial unit-level summaries that focus on the visual properties themselves which affect the decisions, not only the prompts that produced them. Then, we propose recursive procedure to abstract these differences into higher-level themes, which we call agglomerative or Matryoshka summarization. In brief, this procedure embeds each visual-change description, clusters the embeddings into hierarchy of progressively coarser groups, and summarizes each cluster with an LLM into concise, readable themes. In particular, the Matryoshka property here means that higher-level clusters are summarized from lower-level summaries rather than raw texts, in an effort to recursively abstract higher-level themes while preserving traceability to the original items. See Appendices E.1 and for more details. Finally, we validate the causal influence of these concepts by applying them in distilled format to images via zero-shot edits. 3.6. Mitigation Lastly, we test strategy for mitigating these sensitivities we call image normalization. In it, we instruct model to even out the task-irrelevant visual properties of both images in comparison task before VLM judges them. Optionally, this can be repeated for κ passes to iteratively restore the accumulated edits over optimization steps. 4. Results In total, we made 1.8M+ API requests, consumed 2.75B+ tokens, and generated 125k+ images. For disaggregated results, please see Appendix G. 4.1. Experiment 1: Evaluating Effect of Optimization Across all four domains, both zero-shot edits and subsequent optimization shift VLM choice probabilities upward relative to the original images. In particular, we observe two consistent patterns: (i) zero-shot editing already yields large gains over the original; (ii) optimization yields additional gains with magnitude varying by domain and method. Note: estimated probabilities are average of being chosen within paired comparison. Thus each one is [0, 1], and the sum within set 1.5 for set of three. Visual edits strongly shift VLM choices Across all tasks and evaluators, visual presentation alone has large effect on agentic choice. Zero-shot edits already move choice probabilities far from chance and far from the original images. Across methods and domains, zero-shot editing inFigure 2. Estimated marginal mean probability of choice by task (columns) optimization method (rows) and optimization stage (X-axis; original image, zero-shot modified, and final after optimization). Results are averaged across all VLMs. creases selection probability by roughly 0.20.4 relative to the original images, with all zero-shot versus original contrasts statistically significant. These shifts are substantial: in several settings, zero-shot edits more than double the probability that an image is selected in head-to-head comparison. This establishes baseline fact: VLMs exhibit strong and systematic visual sensitivities to contextual features even when semantic content is held fixed and no explicit optimization is applied, i.e. sophisticated image editing models may be able to implicitly reason about what properties evoke these effects. Optimization can often yield additional gains Iterative visual prompt optimization then further increases choice probabilities beyond zero-shot editing, but the size of this gain depends on both the method and the domain. CVPO and VFD reliably extract additional improvements after the zero-shot step, often on the order of +0.10.3 in absolute choice probability (pp.). These gains are statistically significant across most settings. By contrast, VTGs final outputs sometimes show modest to negligible improvement beyond the zero-shot baseline. Taken together, these results suggest that while visual sensitivity is feasible to trigger, systematically exploiting it may require an optimization procedure 6 Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? that can robustly navigate noisy preference feedback. 4.2. Experiment 2: Comparing Optimization Methods Figure 3. Estimated marginal mean probability of choice for final optimized images produced by different optimization methods in head-to-head comparisons. Results are averaged across all VLMs with error bars showing 95% confidence intervals. VLM preferences most often favor CVPO In direct comparisons between the final outputs of each optimization method, CVPO wins most often on average across models, though only slightly more than VFD (results shown in Figure 3). This effect is heterogeneous by task and model. Results by model  (Table 1)  show that CVPOs final images are selected with high probability, outperforming VFD by 0.040.21 on 7/9 models and VTG by much larger margins (0.460.64). These differences are largely statistically significant (6/7 < .0001 vs. VFD, 9/9 < .0001 vs. VTG). Anthropic models here constitute partial exception. For Claude Haiku 4.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5, VFD slightly outperforms CVPO, though the gap is modest and only significant for Haiku. Even here, VTG is far behind. Different methods come with efficiency trade-offs All methods are parameterized to search for minimum of 10 iterations and maximum of 30. In this regime, VTG always takes 30 iterations (100% relative to the iteration budget) since this implementation lacks an early-stopping procedure. VFD, with its patience-based stopping criterion, averages 24.9 iterations (74.6% of budget). CVPO averages 17.4 (36.9% of budget). Budget % = (niterminiter) (maxiter miniter) . Note this measures efficiency in iterations, but CVPO generates more images per iteration (depending on κ). 4.3. Experiment 3 & 4: Human Studies First, we examine the effect of image state (original, zeroshot edited, or optimized) on human choice probability. Table 3 shows that humans are substantially more likely to pick the optimized versions over the original images. Humans also pick the final images more often than the zero-shot images for VFD and CVPO, but this effect is not statistically significant for CVPO (p=0.057). 7 In the second study, we mimic the earlier head-to-head comparisons. Like with VLMs, humans preferences in the head-to-head comparisons favor CVPOs optimized images over the other strategies on average, however this effect is task dependent (CVPO: 0.52; VTG: 0.51; VFD: 0.48). However, no post-hoc contrasts here are statistically significant at the α=0.05 level. Also like the VLMs, the ordering is not consistent with that which we might infer from the final acceptance rates in the initial experiment: here, VTG beats the others on 2/4 tasks (more details in Appendix E.3). 4.4. Experiment 5: Automated Interpretability The auto-interpretability results suggest that different optimization methods converge on broadly similar kinds of edits within each task. For hotels, the pipeline identifies themes such as Biophilic and botanical integrations, Luxury furniture and textile upgrades, Warm ambient lighting adjustments, and Human presence and hospitality elements for CVPO; the other methods produce themes with overlapping meaning. For houses, VFD produces edits along themes like Twilight lighting transitions, Lush landscaping upgrades, and Removal of visual clutter; the other methods show similar, and sometimes identical, themes. For people, we see themes such as Addition of formal business attire and Transition to professional setting (VTG, and representative of the other methods as well). For products, CVPO yields themes including Transition to lifestyle environments, Environmental lighting and visual effects, Human subject and activity integration, and Product internal content exposure; the other methods again appear to exploit similar themes. That distinct optimization strategies recover overlapping visual themes suggests that these edits reflect stable properties of the evaluator VLM models and perhaps even human decision-makers, which can be systematically discovered and better understood through such iterative editing procedures. This interpretability stage thus completes our end-to-end framework for discovering and explaining what drives vision-language models decisions (see Appendix for top level outputs). 4.5. Experiment 6: Mitigation via Image Normalization We test our proposed mitigation strategy in Figure 4 in oneand three-pass (κ) versions (see prompts in Appendix J), motivated by the optimizations accumulated multi-step edits. We find κ=3 evens out probabilities vs. κ=1 and κ=0, suggesting such methods improve but do not fully resolve sensitivity to optimized edits. They also increase choice order-inconsistency, contributing additional evidence to this hypothesis. In Figure 5, we show that image normalization has similar effects for human participants. In Appendix F, we further study how image normalization modifies images. Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? Table 1.

Experiment 7: Prompt Distillation In Figure 6, we test the (in-distribution) causal validity of the discovered visual factors (see Appendix C) by prompting the image editor to apply these in zero-shot fashion (amortizing the optimization cost; see Appendix for prompts). We find that for hotels and houses, distilled edits move choices closer to optimized versions. For people, distilled versions slightly exceed optimized edits. However, for products, distilled versions underperform naive zero-shot edits (possibly due to heterogeneity by product class, which using the top-level prompts ignores). 5. Limitations The optimization framework requires substantial computational resources which puts some pragmatic limits on scalability for now. While we try to enforce identity preservation, the boundary between presentation and substance can be fuzzy in some instances. The operationalized notion of identity maintenance in this paper is defined as preserving the underlying asset: core object or scene (e.g. house structure, hotel space, product, or person), but allows changes to attributes and minor amenities that may offer some increased utility (and thus rationally increase the probability of choice to certain extent). The impact of these factors on the rational choice is difficult to fully quantify, but we treat them as malleable features of the visual presentation that could in fact be changed and might be changed by image edits appearing on online platforms. Our mitigation experiments test one normalization strategy, but more sophisticated defenses may be possible.The human validation studies (N =154) provide directional evidence but Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?

After 3 passes, the probability of choosing the final optimized image decreases. lack the statistical power to detect small effect-size differences in head-to-head comparisons. Generalization to other agentic visual decision contexts with long-horizon temporal sequences would require substantial further development. Our prompt distillation experiment uses the same images as the optimization process, to provide fair apples-to-apples comparison, which potentially limits external validity. We use Gemini Flash variants for both generator and judge; substituting pro or other improved models could further improve results. Finally, while we document that VLMs exhibit exploitable visual sensitivities, full causal or mechanistic explanations require further investigation. 6. Conclusion For much of history, the primary visual intelligence available for systematic perturbation and controlled experimentation was our own. Our methods, intuitions, and expectations 9 Figure 6. Results testing whether distilling the discovered visual edits into zero-shot editing instructions can match the optimization that recovers them. about visual decision-making were calibrated under that constraint. It is thus tempting to carry those priors forward to the study of artificial agents; to assume that human-like performance implies sufficient robustness for delegation. This may be costly mistake. Our results show that VLMs exhibit strong, structured visual preferences that can be surfaced and exploited through naturalistic image edits, even when primary semantic content is held constant. These effects are large, consistent, and achieved without explicit adversarial intent. Studying such agents therefore requires methods that treat visual decision-making as behavioral object in its own right, not only as proxy for human judgment or as byproduct of accuracy on perceptual tasks. We will release our code and data, and invite the community to help build better understanding of how and why perceiving agents make the decisions that they do. We believe this is prerequisite for designing and governing them responsibly."

            "content": "This paper shows that VLMs choices can be shifted substantially by naturalistic changes to presentation even when the underlying object or scene is fixed. The immediate benefit is methodological: our framework provides controlled way to measure and interpret VLMs sensitivities, which can support auditing, debugging, and evaluation beyond accuracy-oriented benchmarks. However, the results also point to concrete risk. The same optimization procedures that reveal VLMs latent visual preferences in this setup could also be used to manipulate them, e.g. actors who control images in marketplaces could differentially advantage certain items without changing their substantive qualities, even potentially to human users. It could also confer greater advantages to those with machine fluency in agentic interactions (Imas et al., 2025), i.e. those who can articulate their preferences to VLM agents clearly enough to override their implicit ones. This has implications for fairness in high-stakes settings, especially where images function as evidence and where decisions compound over time (e.g. real-estate investing, as in one of our examples). To reduce misuse, our experiments preserve visual identity and focus on interpretable edits vs. imperceptible, adversarial perturbations. The work suggests potential practical mitigations, including stronger normalization of visual context, explicit checks for irrelevant but decision-shifting cues, and similar discovery and evaluation protocols that test robustness to plausible presentation changes. Training users to recognize the interpretability-surfaced visual cues and take their potential effects into account may also be helpful, akin to training people to better detect deepfakes and other synthetic media (Kamali et al., 2024). Overall, we argue that systematically measuring modeldriven visual sensitivities is prerequisite for governing image-based agents responsibly: it supports targeted redteaming, robustness checks against varying conditions, and clearer boundaries for when such agents should not be used."

Avoid small superficial adjustments; instead consider substantive changes. Keep the identity of the person exactly unchanged. D.4. Products Prompt You are marketing expert who makes image edits that lead to millions of sales. You can change the context, background, elements, and/or participants. You should follow these editing guidelines, which have been proven to increase the likelihood of product being purchased: - Transition to lifestyle environments: Shifting products from plain backgrounds to furnished interiors, kitchens, gardens, or urban/outdoor settings. - Organic and functional prop staging: Addition of plants, textiles, furniture, laptops, and culinary items like copper cookware. - Environmental lighting and visual effects: Application of golden hour tones, directional shadows, sparkles, and starry sky overlays. - Human subject and activity integration: Inclusion of models, hands interacting with products, and active cooking scenes. - Product internal content exposure: Displaying open products to reveal items like cash, IDs, and credit cards. Avoid small superficial adjustments; instead consider substantive changes. Keep the product itself exactly unchanged. E. Additional Methodological Details E.1. Interpretability This auto-interpretability algorithm is fully presented in Algorithm 4. First, it ingests per-item change descriptions, and then groups these items by strategy and task. For each group, it computes embeddings (by default we use OpenAIs text-embedding-3-small model). It then builds full agglomerative clustering tree. Target cluster counts are thus derived by halving the number of items per level (ceil), and labels are recorded at the merge steps where those target counts occur, yielding multi-level hierarchy. At each level, clusters are formed by the recorded change descriptions. If using the Matryoshka pathway (which we do for the main results reported in this paper) and previous level exists, the cluster inputs are the previous levels summaries; otherwise, the inputs are the raw text descriptions. Each cluster is summarized in parallel using the LLM with schema-constrained prompt; singletons are passed through directly.

E.2. Analysis Each trial from our main experiments involves binary choice between two images (which could be original, zero-shot edited, or optimized; from any of the methods depending on the specific experiment). We reshape these comparisons to the image level which generally gives pair of observations per trial with the outcome Yti {0, 1} = 1 if image in trial is chosen. For the mitigation model experiment, we consider Inconsistent as distinct outcome, so the reshaping yields three rows per trial instead. The full list of regressors across our models: ρti: optimization status chosen (original, zero-shot edited, final optimized, distilled, or inconsistent; the specific set depends on the experimental condition) sti: strategy identity (VTG, VFD, or CVPO) mti: model identity (dummy variables for VLMs) cti: image class (for the multi-class datasets) τti: task identity (dummy variables for the different datasets/tasks) κti: mitigation passes ( {0, 1, 3} for model mitigation; {0, 3} for human mitigation) All specifications include cluster-robust standard errors. In the human studies these are by participant and pair ID (two-way); otherwise, they are by pair ID only (one-way). We estimate Linear Probability Models (LPMs) using fixest. Coefficients are interpretable as percentage-point (pp.) changes in choice probability. We then use estimated marginal means and post-hoc contrasts via emmeans to derive the concise, interpretable estimates we report in the paper. The model specifications are thus of the form Yti = βXti + εti: Main (task-level, model judgments): Xti = (ρti + sti + mti + cti)[4] for class-labeled tasks; otherwise Xti = (ρti + sti + mti)[3] Main (pooled across tasks, model judgments): Xti = (ρti + sti + mti + τti)[4] Head-to-head (overall, model judgments): Xti = (sti + mti)[2] τti where τti denotes task fixed effects (no task interactions in this overall head-to-head specification due to heavy imbalance) Head-to-head (per-task, model judgments): Xti = (sti + mti + τti)[3]. Mitigation (model judgments): Xti = (ρti + mti + κti)[3] with ρ {Original, Final, Inconsistent} Main (human): Xti = (ρti + sti + τti)[3] Head-to-head (human): Xti = (sti + τti)[2] Mitigation (human): Xti = (ρti + τti + κti)[3] with ρ {Original, Final}. Distillation: Xti = (ρti + mti)[2] with ρ {Zero-shot, Final, Distilled}. In all of these, ()[N ] indicates inclusion of all main effects and up-to-N -way interactions among the listed terms within parentheses. E.3. Human Experiments Across all experiments, we recruit 154 total participants: 64 for the first experiment (original vs. zero-shot vs. final within-strategies), 50 for the second experiment (head-to-head comparisons between strategies final versions), and 40 for the third experiment (original vs final mitigations). In the first experiment, each participant makes 30 comparisons for total of 1920 judgment observations. In the second experiment, each participant makes 32 comparisons for total of 1600 judgment observations. In the third experiment, each participant makes 40 comparisons for total of 1600 judgment oberservations. All experiments are determined to be exempt by our institutions IRB and conducted on the Prolific platform, with target rate of $12/hour; real hourly average rate of $26.47/hour (first experiment) and $14.12/hour (second experiment) based on the measured completion durations. Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? F. Effects of Mitigation on Visual Similarity Figure 8 shows an analysis of how the mitigation procedure affects the perceptual similarity of the images to their own original states and to each other in comparison pair (where the mitigating model is explicitly instructed to align visual features of the two). We provide several metrics for robustness: cosine similarity of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) embeddings with and without backgrounds (matted using U2-NetP (Qin et al., 2020) model), SSIM (Wang et al., 2004) with and without backgrounds, and LPIPS distance (Zhang et al., 2018). The results suggest that: 1. Mitigation steps are effective in more closely aligning the perceptual features of images within choice set (pair) 2. They successfully move optimized images closer to their original states 3. They also accomplish their effects by modifying the properties of the original images from choice sets, e.g. applying more of the other images (optimized) properties Figure 8. Similarity/distance metrics as function of number of mitigation steps. We compare images between those in choice set (pair), and also the mitigation-processed versions against the originals split by whether the processed image is an optimized image or an original itself (in which case it may deviate from perfect match). Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. G. Disaggregated Empirical Results Here we report disaggregated versions of the main stage-based and head-to-head comparisons shown in the body of the paper, with results broken out by evaluator model, task domain, image class, and optimization strategy to help assess heterogeneity in the main effects. All figures follow the same evaluation protocol described in the main text: pairwise forced-choice judgments with order randomization, exclusion of inconsistent responses, and analysis via linear probability models with estimated marginal means. Figure 9 presents head-to-head comparisons between final optimized images produced by different optimization methods, disaggregated by evaluator VLM. Figure 10 disaggregates these head-to-head comparisons by task domain. These figures document cross-model and cross-task heterogeneity in relative performance between VTG, VFD, and CVPO under identical comparison procedures. Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? Figures 11 and 13 to 15 report estimated marginal mean choice probabilities for original, zero-shot edited, and final optimized images, stratified jointly by evaluator model and optimization strategy, separately for each task domain. These plots extend Figure 2 by displaying heterogeneity across individual VLMs. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals derived from the corresponding linear probability models. Figures 12 and 16 disaggregate results further by image class within the multi-class datasets (hotel image type and product category, respectively). These figures report choice probabilities by optimization strategy and image class, averaged across evaluators, again with 95% confidence intervals. All results in this appendix are descriptive decompositions of the same underlying experimental comparisons reported in the main text and in general do not introduce additional evaluation criteria, filtering rules, or model specifications beyond those already described. Figure 17 disaggregates the mitigation results on human participants by task. Tables 4 and 5 detail heterogeneity in VLM choice by strategy and optimization status, and human choice by strategy, status, and task respectively.Appendix are regression tables for the linear probability models from experiments 3 and 4 in the main paper, and from the experiment comparing mitigation results with previous results.
