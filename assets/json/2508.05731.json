            "content": "The development of autonomous agents capable of operating across the vast landscape of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is key frontier in achieving general-purpose human-computer interaction (Wang et al. 2024b). The success of these agents is fundamentally predicated on core perceptual task: GUI Grounding. This task involves accurately mapping natural language instruction to specific interactive element on screen. The challenge of GUI *These authors contributed equally. Work done during an internship at InfiX.ai. Work done outside of Amazon. Corresponding author. Figure 1: Primary GUI-grounding failure modes. (a) Spatial-alignment failure: the model selects the correct icon but localizes it imprecisely. (b) Semantic-alignment failure: the model localizes precisely on an incorrect icon due to misinterpreting the instruction. Although RLVR methods have advanced spatial alignment, semantic alignment remains the critical bottleneck for complex GUI tasksthis work is devoted to addressing it. Grounding can be deconstructed into two orthogonal dimensions: Spatial Alignment, which focuses on the precision of locating an element (i.e., pointing accurately), as shown in Fig. 1(a). Semantic Alignment, which pertains to the correctness of identifying the appropriate element to interact with (i.e., pointing at the right target), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Robust and reliable agent performance in complex, realworld scenarios hinges on proficiency in both, with Semantic Alignment being particularly critical. Current fine-tuning methodologies for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face major challenges in achieving robust spatial alignment and semantic alignment. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can be effective, it is highly data-intensive and struggles to generalize to unseen UI layouts (Cheng et al. 2024). By contrast, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves data efficiency by optimizing sequential coordinate generation, which has proven effective at enhancing spatial alignment (Yuan et al. 2025). However, most of existing RLVR methods share one limitation: inefficient exploration. They rely on the models current policy to sample actions and thus get stuck on highconfidence errors. This confidence trap prevents discovery of low-probability but correct actions, bottlenecking semantic alignment. As shown in Fig. 1(b), when the instruction is Use the camera to search for an object on screen displaying various icons, model with weak semantic understanding may repeatedly select the generic Camera button. Standard RLVR would keep sampling this high-confidence but incorrect Camera icon, rarely stumbling upon the correct Google Lens icon, and thus fail to receive the learning signal necessary to correct its semantic misunderstanding. We introduce Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), novel approach to overcome the exploration bottleneck in standard RL. By integrating the multianswer generation strategy, AEPO drives the model to explore diverse set of candidate solutions in single forward pass, addressing the limitations of standard RL, which struggles with low sampling efficiency and the strategy confidence trap. Complemented through the adaptive exploration reward (AER), non-linear reward signal, AEPO dynamically guides exploration, promoting exploration during failures and convergence upon successes, while avoiding the simplistic or distance-based rewards. Additionally, the quality-of-exploration penalty ensures high-quality exploration by penalizing inefficient, near-collinear outputs, fostering true semantic diversity rather than simplistic linear scans in the geometric space. In summary, the key contributions of our work are as follows: We present novel policy-optimization method, Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), which integrates multi-answer generation into the reinforcement learning framework to boost exploration efficiency for GUI grounding significantly. To balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, we devise an Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) that incentivizes models to explore both extensively and purposefully. Building on the above framework, we introduce the InfiGUI-G1 series model3B and 7B variantswhose extensive evaluation across diverse benchmarks establishes state-of-the-art in the GUI grounding task."

However, its approach introduced new taskGUI groundingwhich has been identified as key metric in this paradigm but also as primary performance bottleneck. To address GUI grounding, researchers have advanced spectrum of techniques that enhance MLLMs visuallocating capabilities. These include large-scale pre-training on GUI-specific corpora (Qin et al. 2025a; Yang et al. 2025a; Wu et al. 2025b), targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Yang et al. 2025c; Hui et al. 2025), and reasoningoriented frameworks (Luo et al. 2025; Lee et al. 2025; Wei et al. 2025). In parallel, novel training techniques have been adapted for MLLMs, including coordinate-free methods that generate attention maps instead of explicit coordinates (Wu et al. 2025c), and inference-time optimization strategies that elevate performance without retraining (Wu et al. 2025a)."

            "content": "In the context of GUI grounding, RL has demonstrated practical applicability through several notable approaches (Liu et al. 2025b; Zhou et al. 2025b; Tang et al. 2025; Lian et al. 2025a; Yang et al. 2025b). UI-R1 (Lu et al. 2025a) introduces novel rule-based action reward mechanism that enables model optimization using policy-based algorithms. GUI-R1 (Luo et al. 2025) adopts unified action space modeling strategy, which extracts and integrates action space categories across different platforms into cohesive framework. Additionally, self-supervised (Gao, Zhang, and Xu 2025) and self-evolutionary (Yuan et al. 2025) RL methods have been proposed to address the limitations of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often relies on large amounts of diverse labeled data. Reinforcement fine-tuning (Zhang et al. 2025) also shows promise as pathway toward integrated training. R-VLM (Park et al. 2025) introduces two-stage zoom-in grounding process that refines predictions through zoomed-in view of region proposals. This is combined with an IoU-aware weighted cross-entropy loss to enhance fine-grained perception in grounding tasks. Overall, RL has proven to be an effective and efficient approach for training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and advancing GUI grounding performance. Notably, these methods are constrained by singleanswer generation paradigm, which leads to inefficient exploration and can reinforce the models confident but incorrect behaviors. In contrast, our framework employs multianswer generation to enforce broader search, which is then guided by our adaptive exploration reward function to provide richer and more effective learning signals."

            "content": "Figure 2: Visualization of the AER function based on the efficiency ratio η = U/C. (a) The reward curve increases nonlinearly to strongly incentivize selection of the correct answer, i.e., lower rank k. (b) The AER dynamically balances exploration and exploitation: successful trials (green/blue curves) receive higher reward for greater efficiency (smaller candidate set ), whereas failures (red curve) incur diminishing penalties to promote broader exploration. Multi-Answer Generation. To fundamentally bypass the exploration bottleneck, our mechanism prompts the to generate set of candidate points, = model {p1, p2, ..., pN }, in single forward pass. This forces the model to look beyond its single most confident prediction, significantly increasing the probability of sampling correct action from the tail of the policys distribution, especially for semantically challenging samples. Adaptive Exploration Reward. AER provides an adaptive reward signal to guide the multi-answer exploration process. It is derived from first-principles model of efficiency, η = U/C, where is utility and is cost. Utility (U ): The utility is defined by the outcome of the exploration. If any point pi falls within the ground truth bounding box B, the exploration is success (U = +1). Otherwise, it is failure (U = 1), reflecting not only the wasted computational resources but also the risk of guiding the agent into an erroneous state. Cost (C): The cost is modeled as the geometric mean of two components. The proposal cost, Cp = , represents the effort to generate candidates. The verification cost, Cv, represents the subsequent effort to identify the correct answer. We use the geometric mean, = (cid:112)Cp Cv, as it appropriately captures the diminishing marginal returns of improving an already high-ranked answer. In case of success, Cv = (the rank of the first k. In case of correct point), leading to Csuccess = failure, all points must be checked, so Cv = , and Cfailure = = . Figure 3: Comparison of AEPO and naive RL baseline. Top: The naive single-answer approach becomes trapped on highconfidence errors, repeatedly sampling the same incorrect action and producing vanishing learning signal when no positive reward is discovered. Bottom: AEPO employs multi-answer generation to explore diverse candidates each rollout and an AER to derive an informative learning signal from their efficiency and correctness. These mechanisms break the exploration bottleneck in GUI agents and enable robust semantic alignment. This leads to the AER function, which defines the accuracy component of our total reward: Raccuracy(A, B) = (cid:26)1/ if pi s.t. pi 1/N otherwise (2) This reward structure dynamically encourages wider exploration upon failure and rewards efficient, confident predictions upon success. Collinear Penalty. To further improve the quality of exploration, we introduce penalty for low-quality exploration strategies. If the set of generated points is found to be approximately collinear, we override the accuracy reward with large negative value, Raccuracy = 1. Collinearity is determined by checking if the area of the triangle formed by any three points in the set is close to zero. This discourages the model from adopting trivial, inefficient linear scanning strategies and incentivizes more spatially diverse exploration."

MMBench-GUI (Wang et al. 2025) is comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design of basic and advanced instructions, which we use to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our method across tasks of varying complexity. ScreenSpot-Pro (Li et al. 2025) is benchmark designed to evaluate performance on high-resolution screens from professional software. Its distinct separation of textbased and icon-based grounding tasks provides valuable setting to probe models semantic understanding, as icon grounding in particular requires associating abstract symbols with their functions. UI-Vision (Nayak et al. 2025) is designed to test generalization across wide variety of desktop applications, assessing the models robustness in diverse, unseen environments. Additionally, we report results on the widely-used ScreenSpot-v2 (Cheng et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2024) benchmark, which provides comprehensive coverage across mobile, desktop, and web platforms with focus on both text and icon/widget elements. To further probe the semantic reasoning capabilities of the models, we also evaluate on UI-I2E-Bench (Liu et al. 2025a). This next-generation benchmark was designed to overcome limitations of earlier datasets by including higher proportion of implicit instructions that require semantic and spatial reasoning beyond direct text matching. Our primary evaluation metric is Accuracy, where prediction is considered correct if its coordinate point falls within the ground truth bounding box. For methods that output bounding box, its center point is used. To demonstrate the high success rate of our exploration strategy, we also report the Exploration Success Rate for our InfiGUI-G1 models, where sample is marked as success if at least one of the generated candidate points is correct. Baselines. To ensure fair and rigorous comparison, we establish two sets of baselines. First, for controlled analysis, we train Naive RLVR model for both size as internal baselines. It is trained using the exact same dataset and optimized hyperparameters as our core models. Second, to position our work within the broader literature, we compare it against several state-of-the-art models from recent works. Implementation Details. Our InfiGUI-G1 models are built upon the open-source Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as backbones. For the RLVR training phase, we adopt the RLOO algorithm (Ahmadian et al. 2024), which effectively reduces the variance of policy gradient estimates by employing the average reward of other samples within the same batch as baseline. This leaveone-out strategy obviates the need for training separate critic model. The RLOO policy gradient θJ(θ) is estimated as: θJ(θ) R(y(i), x) 1 k (cid:88) i=1 1 1 (cid:88) j=i R(y(j), x) θ log πθ(y(i)x) where is the number of output sequences y(i) sampled from the policy πθ given input x. Across all experiments, we employ reasoning prompting paradigm, instructing the model to generate its reasoning process within <think> </think> tags before providing the final answer. Training Details. Our training data is mixture sampled from several public GUI datasets, including Widget Caption, OmniAct, GUICourse, etc., resulting in approximately 44k samples. Following common practices in RLVR to focus training on more challenging instances, we apply data filtering strategy: for each sample, we generate 8 responses with temperature of 1.0; if all 8 are correct, the sample is deemed too easy and is excluded. All models were trained on 16 H800 GPUs. Key training parameters include learning rate of 1e-6, rollout batch size of 128, and an RLOO rollout number of = 8. We train for 3 epochs."

            "content": "The comparison with our internal baselines reveals that InfiGUI-G1 consistently and substantially outperforms the Naive RLVR model across all benchmarks. This direct comparison suggests that the performance gains can be attributed to the architectural and methodological improvements introduced by AEPO. Furthermore, our models demonstrate strong performance against other SOTA methods, including those based on SFT (e.g., UGround, OS-Atlas), many of which require training data exceeding 1M samples. In contrast, our approach achieves these competitive results using 44k instances, underscoring its data efficiency. Our results also show strong performance against other RLVR approaches that utilize IoU or distance-based rewards (e.g., GUI-R1, GUI-G2). Our method demonstrates strong generalization capabilities by achieving consistently high performance across multiple benchmarks with distinct focuses (e.g., UI-Vision, ScreenSpot-Pro). Crucially, these benchmarks contain many applications and scenarios not present in our training data, indicating that AEPO fosters robust understanding rather than overfitting. The benefits of AEPO in enhancing semantic understanding appear particularly pronounced on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Here, our models show more substantial improvement on icon-based grounding tasks than on text-based ones when compared to the Naive RLVR baseline, suggesting that AEPOs enhanced exploration is especially beneficial for tasks requiring association of abstract visual symbols with their functions."

            "content": "The results reveal clear logic behind AEPOs design. Removing multi-answer generation (w/o Multi-Answer) leads to significant performance drop, confirming that enabling exploration is the necessary first step. However, this exploration must be guided effectively, as replacing our AER with naive reward (w/o AER) causes further decline. The importance of AERs ranking factor is particularly insightful; removing it (w/o k) results in model that often finds the correct answer (high Expl. Succ.) but fails to rank it first (low Acc.), demonstrating that is crucial for teaching the model confidence in its correct discoveries. Finally, the collinear penalty proves essential for ensuring the quality of exploration. Without it, the model adopts degenerate strategy of generating numerous low-quality answers Table 6: Ablation study on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark.

            "content": "Adaptive Exploration Strategy. We investigate if the model learns an adaptive exploration strategy. clear correlation emerges between benchmark difficulty (indicated by model accuracy) and exploratory behavior. Our 7B model generates the most answers on the hardest benchmark (UIVision: 26.1% Acc, 2.1 answers) and the fewest on the easiest (ScreenSpot-V2: 93.5% Acc, 1.4 answers). This suggests AEPO learns to adaptively allocate exploratory resources based on task complexity. Exploration Efficiency. We then evaluate the quality and efficiency of AEPOs exploration. Our InfiGUI-G1 models on ScreenSpot-Pro generate approximately two candidate answers per instance on average. To contextualize this, we compare our single-pass Exploration Success Rate against the multi-pass pass@k accuracy of the Naive RLVR baseline. As detailed in Table 7, the results are compelling. Even when the Naive RLVR model is allowed four independent attempts (pass@4), its success rate in finding correct answer is still significantly lower than that of our InfiGUI-G1, which achieves higher success rate in single pass with only about two attempts. This demonstrates that AEPOs multi-answer generation is not merely about increasing the number of tries, but about performing more structured and efficient exploration of the action space. Performance on Hard-to-Explore Samples. Finally, to validate our core hypothesis that AEPO resolves the exploration bottleneck, we designed an experiment to analyze performance on samples of varying difficulty. We partitioned the ScreenSpot-Pro test set by first using the base MLLM to generate 16 stochastic responses for each sample. Samples Table 7: Exploration efficiency (%) on ScreenSpot-Pro.

The hard subset therefore represents samples that are highly unlikely to be answered correctly through naive exploration. As shown in Table 8, we then compared InfiGUIG1 against the Naive RLVR baseline on these subsets. While our model improves performance across the board, the most significant gains are concentrated on the hard subset. On these critical samples, our 7B model achieves relative improvement of over 60%. This provides direct evidence that AEPO effectively creates learning signals for previously unlearnable samples, addressing the fundamental limitation we set out to solve."

            "content": "In this work, we addressed the critical challenge of enhancing semantic alignment in MLLM-based GUI agents, identifying the inefficient exploration of standard RLVR as key bottleneck. We proposed AEPO, policy optimization framework that integrates multi-answer generation with theoretically-grounded AER function to enable effective exploration. Our model, InfiGUI-G1, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and our comprehensive analyses confirm that its effectiveness stems from its ability to adapt its exploration strategy, its high efficiency compared to naive sampling, and its success in creating learning signals for previously unlearnable samples. Limitations of our work include the computational overhead from multi-answer generation and performance ceiling imposed by the backbone MLLMs visual capabilities, which could be addressed in future work by exploring more efficient sampling strategies and integration with more advanced visual encoders.
