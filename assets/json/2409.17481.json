            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across diverse range of tasks [17, 6, 46, 11]. However, the generality and robustness of LLMs are largely attributed to their vast scale, with parameter counts ranging from one billion to several hundred billion [37, 43, 5]. This substantial model size, in turn, makes it challenging and resource-intensive to deploy LLMs in real-world applications. One effective and practical approach to address this issue is semi-structured pruning [27, 30, 10, 36], which introduces N:M sparsity into LLMs to improve both memory and computational efficiency. The N:M pattern, with non-zero values The work was done at NVIDIA Corresponding Authors: Pavlo Molchanov, Xinchao Wang Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: Learnable N:M sparsity for Large Language Models. among consecutive parameters, is typically hardware-friendly to accelerators like GPUs and has thus garnered considerable attention [10, 36, 30]. Despite the simplicity of its core idea, semi-structured pruning still presents considerable challenges within the realm of LLMs. Sparsity aims to identify subset of parameters that attain comparable quality to the dense model. Nevertheless, the extensive parameter scale of large language models usually leads to vast search space. In fully sparsified LLaMA2-7B model with 2:4 sparsity, for instance, there are 1.6 billion 2:4 masks to be chosen for dense layers. This makes the combinatorial problem of finding the optimal mask set exceedingly challenging. In the literature, leading approaches such as SparseGPT [10] and Wanda [36], utilize small calibration set and carefully designed importance criteria to identify redundant parameters. While these techniques have demonstrated remarkable results on several large language models, two substantial challenges remain: Firstly, the small calibration set is insufficient to represent the comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs, which are pre-trained on extensive and diverse data domains [37, 7, 29]. As demonstrated in our experiments, hand-crafted importance criteria are only applicable to compact subset of data, and enlarging the calibration set beyond 256 entries does not improve the resulting quality. This limits the generalizability of pruned LLMs in different domains. Secondly, using handcrafted criteria as proxy for the true discrepancy inevitably results in errors. considerable gap remains between the real discrepancy induced by pruning and existing importance indicators, such as gradient information [28], weight magnitude [13], and the Hessian Matrix [21, 10]. To tackle the outlined challenges, we propose MaskLLM, learnable method that facilitates end-toend training of LLM sparsity on large-scale datasets. In the context of N:M sparsity, pruning an LLM involves selecting masks from discrete and finite set. However, the non-differentiability of mask selection and combination hinders the direct use of backpropagation for mask learning. To address this, our work frames the mask selection problem from probabilistic perspective, associating each candidate mask with probability and modeling the mask selection as stochastic sampling process. We incorporate the Gumbel Softmax [19] for differentiable sampling, which re-parameterizes the randomness of sampling into an independent random variable. This makes the probabilities of each mask candidate optimizable with gradient descent. During training, MaskLLM aims to learn appropriate mask distributions, from which the sampled masks can preserve the original quality of dense LLMs. The differentiable mask offers two advantages in addressing the challenges mentioned above: (1) it effectively scales to large-scale datasets, thereby preserving the rich knowledge in LLMs, and (2) the end-to-end training explicitly optimizes the language modeling loss of LLMs, which exactly measures the discrepancy induced by pruning. Furthermore, inspired by the power of transfer learning, we introduce prior masks, simple strategy to fully leverage pre-computed masks and enable fast transfer learning of sparsity across domains and tasks as illustrated in Figure 1 To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on several LLMs including LLaMA-2 7B, LLaMA-2 13B [37], Nemotron-4 15B [29], and two in-house LLMs, GPT-3 843M and GPT-3 2B pre-trained using Megatron framework [34]. Our method can learn high-quality masks for pruning through end-to-end training on large-scale datasets. For example, compared to SparseGPT which archives perplexity (PPL) of 10.42 on LLaMA-2 7B, our method improves the PPL to 6.72, without any update to the LLM parameters. Besides, our method facilitates the learning of domain-specific masks, which can even achieve lossless compression of LLMs on some downstream tasks or domains. The principal contribution of this work lies in learnable method for semi-structured pruning of LLMs. MaskLLM is designed to fully harness large-scale datasets to learn accurate masks, applicable to both general-purpose and domain-specific pruning. Additionally, the framework facilitates the transfer learning of sparsity patterns across different tasks, enabling efficient training of sparsity."

            "content": "Pruning Large Language Models. Network Pruning [13, 28, 15, 16, 39] have been proven an efficient approach to compress pre-trained language models via the removal of redundant parameters. According to the granularity of pruning, existing methods can be classified into three categories: Structured Pruning [24, 41, 22], Unstructured Pruning [15, 13], and Semi-Structured Pruning [10, 36, 27, 30, 31]. Structured pruning physically eliminates substructures like attention heads [24], embeddings or depth [41] in the model, facilitating acceleration independent of specialized hardware or software infrastructure [30]. However, structured approaches typically necessitate huge retraining 2 efforts to recover network quality due to coarse removal of parameters [24, 41, 25, 2]. Conversely, unstructured methods aim to find sparse model by zeroing out parameters in LLMs, which is characterized by its flexibility and minimal detrimental effect on LLMs accuracy [10, 36, 18, 40, 42]. The acceleration of sparse models is typically impeded by the irregular nature of the resulting sparse patterns, presenting challenges in achieving computational efficiency. Positioned between structured and unstructured methods, the semi-structured approach introduces hardware-friendly patterns such as N:M sparsity, which leaves only nonzero values in each group of values and thereby harmonizes the acceleration benefits of structured pattern with the flexibility of fine-grained sparsity [30, 31, 10]. In this study, we focus on N:M semi-structured sparsity within Large Language Models and present learnable framework to obtain high-quality masks via end-to-end training. Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity. On another hand, burgeoning interest exists in developing learnable masks [47, 23, 45], especially in the field of vision models. Markedly contrasted with traditional one-shot pruning methods that rely on predetermined metric of importance, learnable sparsity can fully leverage the rich information in training data, enabling the identification of more effective sparsity masks. particularly popular strategy is to directly update the network weight, such as pushing partial weights to zero with Sparse-Refined Straight-Through Estimator (SR-STE) [3, 15, 23] or permuting parameters to achieve better quality [31]. Other methods learn additional indicators to reveal the importance of weight, such as differentiable indexing [33], optimizable combination [45], or decaying [20]. In this work, we make the first attempt to learn N:M masks for frozen LLMs, which is much more challenging due to the huge parameter amount and problem scale."

            "content": "3.1 N:M Sparsity ! We motivate and introduce learnable framework, MaskLLM, to sparsify Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved inference efficiency. Sparsifying an LLM with N:M patterns imposes the constraint of having (no more than) non-zero values within each consecutive set of parameters. This task can be formulated as mask selection problem with the candidate set of = (cid:0)M (cid:1) = !(M )! candidates, where denotes the size of the candidate set, and (cid:0)M (cid:1) represents the combination number of potential N:M masks. For simplicity, this work primarily focuses on 2:4 sparsity, which can be naturally extended to other patterns such as 1:4 and 4:8. Given parameter block comprising four consecutive parameters, denoted as R14, the goal of sparsification is to identify the optimal binary mask B14 of the same size, ensuring that the pruned weight maintains its behavior on observed data p(x). For 2:4 sparsity, the binary mask must contain exactly two zeros, resulting in discrete candidate set S2:4 with S2:4 = (cid:0)4 (cid:1) = 6 candidates: 2 S2:4 = {M B14 (cid:88) = 2} = { ˆM1, ˆM2, ˆM3, ˆM4, ˆM5, ˆM6} = {[1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]}. (1) (2) For an LLM, there exists substantial number of parameter blocks, denoted as {Wi}, each requiring the selection of corresponding masks {Mi}. To maintain satisfactory behavior after pruning, it is natural to define the following objective for N:M sparsity: {M } = argmin {MiMiS2:4} Exp(x) [LLM (x; {Wi Mi})] , (3) where LLM refers to the language modeling loss for pre-training. The operator denotes elementwise multiplication, which masks partial parameters for sparsification. However, finding the optimal combination of masks can be extremely challenging in the context of LLMs due to the nondifferentiable nature of mask selection and the huge parameter scale. In the following sections, we demonstrate that the mask selection can be transformed into sampling process. 3.2 MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity Consider single parameter block R14 consisting of only 4 parameters: directly determining the exact optimal mask for this block is not feasible, since the behavior of the pruned LLM also 3 Figure 2: This work introduces learnable semi-structured sparsity for LLMs. MaskLLM models mask selection as distribution learning problem, enabling the creation of accurate masks through end-to-end training on large-scale datasets. The learned and general mask can be further transferred to downstream tasks or domains, achieving lossless compression. depends on the pruning of other parameter blocks. Nevertheless, it remains feasible to sample masks independently for each block and assess the overall model quality after pruning. To facilitate random sampling of M, we define categorical distribution with class probability p1, p2, . . . pS, which satisfy (cid:80) pj = 1. During the random sampling phase, if certain mask achieves good quality during pruning, its reasonable to adjust the categorical distribution by increasing the probability of the sampled mask. With sufficient sampling and updates, this process ends with distribution where the mask with high probability is more likely to maintain good quality after pruning. Formally, we model the combination problem in Equation 3 from the perspective of random sampling: {p(Mi)} = argmin {p(Mi)} Exp(x),Mip(Mi) [LLM (x; {Wi Mi})] , (4) where p(Mi) refers to the categorical distribution of i-th mask Mi. If it is feasible to get the gradient w.r.t. the distribution, then the above objective can be optimized with gradient descent as demonstrated in Figure 2. Nonetheless, drawing samples from categorical distribution is still non-differentiable. Differentiable Sampling of Masks An effective method to model sampling operation is Gumbel Max [12], re-parameterization trick that disentangles the randomness of sampling into noise variable. This trick introduces method to draw samples from the categorical distribution with an additional noise variable ϵ. It produces the one-hot index for sampling: = onehot(argmax [log(pi) + gi]), gi = log( log ϵi), ϵi (0, 1), (5) where ϵi is random noise following uniform distribution, and the gi = log( log ϵi) is known as the Gumbel noise. With the Gumbel Max trick, the randomness of sampling is parameterized to an independent variable gi. The only issue towards differentiable sampling lies in the argmax and onehot operation. To address this, we leverage Gumbel Softmax [19] to approximate the index with Softmax, leading to soft and differentiable index = [y1, y2, . . . , yS]: yi = exp((log(pi) + gi)/τ ) exp((log(pj) + gj)/τ ) (cid:80) . (6) The temperature term τ is hyper-parameter, controlling the hardness of the sampled index. While τ 0, the soft index will be more close to one-hot vector, resulting in yi yi. With the soft index as row vector and the mask set as matrix where each row refers to the i-th candidate mask ˆMi, its easy to craft differentiable mask through simple matrix multiplication: = = (cid:88) i=1 yi ˆMi. (7) This operation produces weighted average of candidate masks according to the soft index. As shown in Figure 3, we can find all operations, including the sampling and weighted averaging are differentiable, and the gradient w.r.t. the probability can be easily computed. This allows using the differentiable mask to optimize the sampling problem defined in Equation 4. Figure 3: Drawing random mask from the learnable distribution with Gumbel Softmax. Each consecutive parameters are associated with learnable distribution for candidate masks. All illustrated computations, including Gumbel Softmax, and the weighted averaging are differentiable. Learning Masks for LLMs Equation 7 provides differentible mask sampled from the underlying distribution p. The gradient flow can easily reach the probability pi, making it an optimizable variable in the system. Typically, we do not directly learn the probability and instead, learn the logits πi with scaling factor κ, which produces the probability as pi = exp(πiκ) exp(πj κ) . As will be discussed in Section 4.3, the scaling factor κ will be used to balance the relative magnitude of logits and Gumbel noises, which controls the randomness of sampling. During training, all parameter blocks {Wi} are associated with the corresponding distributions {pπ(Mi)}, and optimal distribution can be learned in an end-to-end manner. However, our empirical experiments on several large language models reveal new issue with the learnable masks: the gradient may vanish due to the pruning operation that produces zero parameters in the network. This issue will adversely affect downstream transfer and fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce Sparse Weight Regularization, which maintains an appropriately large magnitude in the remaining weights, leading to the following learning objective: (cid:80) min {pπ(Mi)} x, Mipπ(Mi) (cid:105) (cid:104) LLM (x; {Wi Mi}) λ (cid:88) Wi Mi2 2. (8) The regularization term weighted by λ encourages large magnitude after pruning. Transfer Learning of Sparsity. Transfer learning is one of the most popular paradigms in deep learning. In this section, we show the feasibility of transfer learning in sparsity, which crafts new masks by inheriting pre-computed ones. The pre-computed masks can be obtained with oneshot pruning methods like Magnitude Pruning [13], SparseGPT [10] and Wanda [36], or produced by another learning process. Note that given probability [p1, p2, . . . , pS], the transformation to the final mask is straightforward with simple argmax. However, if it is possible to map pre-computed mask back to the class probabilities, then the proposed MaskLLM can begin with good initialization for sampling. This can hugely improve learning efficiency and quality. To achieve this, we propose Mask Prior, simple technique to initialize distribution. Given prior mask denoted as M0, we compute its similarity to all candidate masks as: sim(M0, ˆMi) = M0 ˆM 1 (cid:88) (Mi ˆM) = Mi ˆM (N/2), (9) which computes the inner product of two masks and re-centers the results with the mean. Note that for N:M sparsity, the range of M0 ˆM i(Mi ˆM) = N/2 is constant. For candidate masks with high similarity to the prior mask, we increase its probability at the initialization stage with: will always be [0, ], the mean value (cid:80) = πi + σ(π) sim(M0, ˆMi) α, π where σ(o) is the standard deviation of logits and α is hyper-parameter that controls the strength of prior. When α = 0, we learn the differentiable mask without any prior from one-shot methods. (10) Method Summary. The learning process of MaskLLM is straightforward. We begin with randomly initialized logits and update it with prior masks as Equation 10 if available. Then we optimize the logits to solve the objective in Equation 8. The mask Mi with the largest logits will be taken as the final mask for inference. This process is summarized in Algorithm 1. 5 Algorithm 1 MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for LLMs (2:4) exp((πj κ+gj )/τ ) , gi = log( log ϵi), ϵi (0, 1). i=0 pi Mi (cid:80) 1: procedure DIFFERENTIABLEMASK(π, S) 2: Obtain the soft index = exp((πiκ+gi)/τ ) Compute the differentiable mask = = (cid:80)S 3: return 4: 5: end procedure 6: = { ˆM1, ˆM2, . . . , ˆMS} = {[1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], . . .

            "content": "4.1 Implementation Details. We evaluated MaskLLM on three large language model families, ranging in size from 843M to 15B parameters. This included public models like LLaMA-2 7B and 13B [37], Nemotron-4 15B [29], and two in-house models, multilingual GPT-3 843M and 2B [34]. For LLaMA-2 and Nemotron-4, we collected blended training set following the original papers [34, 29] for training. For the GPT-3 multilingual models, we used the original training set for mask learning. To learn masks, we trained the Gumbel logits for 2,000 steps without updating the LLM parameters. For evaluation, we follow SparseGPT [10] to use C4 dataset [32] for one-shot pruning and Wikitext [26] for evaluation. In addition, we also deploy LM-Eval-Harness [11] for zero-shot evaluation. More details about the models, datasets, training, and evaluation can be found in the appendix. 4.2 Learning 2:4 Sparsity in LLMs Finding 1. Learnable Sparsity scales effectively to large-scale datasets and can fully leverage computational resources to learn precise masks through end-to-end training. End-to-end training yields accurate masks. In Table 1, we report the perplexity and accuracies of our method, compared to three 2:4 sparse baselines: Magnitude Pruning [14], SparseGPT [10], and Wanda [36]. Previous works can produce satisfactory 2:4 masks efficiently but often suffer from inaccurate estimation of weight importance. The inaccuracy mainly arises from two factors: (1) Accuracy of importance metric: Due to the difficulty of computing the error caused by pruning, existing methods use approximated metrics to estimate weight importance, which inevitably results in errors. (2) Scalability: LLMs are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets with rich knowledge, but the calibration sets used in existing methods contain very limited samples. With the learnable mask, the above challenges can be naturally addressed through end-to-end training on large-scale datasets, which directly optimizes the language modeling loss. As illustrated in Table 1, MaskLLM yields superior results compared to existing baselines. For instance, with the LLaMA-2 7B model, the proposed method learns mask with PPL of 6.72, which is better than the PPL of 10.42 obtained by SparseGPT with weight update. More results such as comparison to other baselines  (Table 13)  and visualization of mask difference (Figure 8) can be found in the appendix. Scaling to large-scale datasets. To further elaborate on the above analysis, we illustrate the relationship between the number of consumed samples and the Wikitext PPL of pruned LLaMA2 7B in Figure 4. For one-shot methods such as SparseGPT, all consumed samples are used to compute the Hessian for importance estimation. Increasing the calibration set size from 32 to 256 samples improves the results, but expansion beyond 256 samples yields no notable advantages. 6 Method Wikitext PPL HellaS. RACE PIQA WinoG.

One-shot pruning methods are calibrated with C4 and evaluated on Wikitext-2 following [10]. More results for Llama-3 [1] or other SOTA methods can be found in Table 12 and 13 of the appendix. In contrast, our proposed learnable method effectively scales to large datasets. Results in Figure 4 show that increasing the number of samples within our framework consistently improves mask quality, with positive results still observable when scaling up to 512k samples. Additionally, our method is also data-efficient and thus applicable to low-resource scenarios with only 1280 samples. With batch size of 256, the learnable mask is updated for only 5 steps and still produces slightly better masks than SparseGPT. If limited to only one or two steps, the training-based method fails to be comparable to one-shot methods, as this limits the random exploration for finding high-quality masks. 4.3 How to Learn Good Mask for LLMs Figure 4: Consumed samples vs. PPL on LLaMA2 7B. MaskLLM requires 128 samples for the prior and outperforms SparseGPT after 1280 samples. Finding 2. Taking pre-computed masks as prior improves training efficiency and mask quality. Transfer Learning with Mask Prior. An important feature of the proposed method lies in transfer learning. We can initialize the Gumbel logits with pre-computed masks, which significantly accelerate the training. In Table 2, we learn masks using different prior types, including Magnitude prior [13], SparseGPT prior [10], and Wanda prior [36]. Firstly, even without any prior, the learnable mask still achieves superior quality compared to the existing baseline methods, demonstrating its capability to discover high-quality masks through end-to-end training. However, learning accurate masks in only 2,000 steps can be challenging due to the massive parameter scale of LLMs. Using prior masks pre-computed by one-shot methods can provide substantial benefits. For example, with the Magnitude prior that can be easily pre-computed according to the weight magnitude, we can improve the wikitext perplexity of LLaMA-2 7B from 9.12 to 6.77. 7 (a) The mask difference between adjacent steps (b) The Maximum probability of mask distribution Figure 5: (a) The L1 distance of sampled masks between adjacent training steps. (b) The maximum probability of mask distribution, serving as an indicator of convergence. In our method, the randomness of mask sampling is regulated by the scaling factor κ. too-small κ introduces huge randomness, resulting in slow convergence as shown in (b). And an inappropriately large κ will suppress mask exploration and yield zero mask difference throughout the training process in (a).

We report the Wikitext PPL of both prior and learned masks. The learned masks use the corresponding prior for initialization and refine the logits through end-to-end training. All results are obtained with frozen weights. Finding 3. The randomness of sampling is crucial for mask learning. Encouraging stochastic exploration on candidate masks. At the early stage of mask learning, the optimal mask is unknown. The stochastic sampling with Gumbel softmax allows for the exploration of different candidate masks, which is crucial for effective learning. As mentioned in Section 3.2, the scaling factor κ controls the randomness of sampling. To illustrate this, we visualize the learning process in Figures 5a and 5b, showing the mask difference between adjacent steps and the maximum probability of the learnable distribution, respectively. With large factor, such as κ=1e5, the Gumbel softmax will be dominated mainly by the logits rather than the Gumbel noises, which produce similar masks with high confidence throughout the training process. In contrast, with small scaling factor, such as κ=1, the Gumbel noises contribute more to the sampling. As illustrated in Figure 5a, the mask is continuously changing during training, leading to slow convergence. Therefore, selecting an appropriate scaling factor is crucial, which should guarantee sufficient randomness and an acceptable convergence speed. In this work, we use κ=1e2 and linearly increase it to 5e2 for all experiments. Finding 4. Maintaining large magnitude of the remaining weights improves downstream tasks. Task Wi Mi2 Maintaining large magnitude of the remaining weights. In Equation 8, we introduce regularizer in the form of λ (cid:80) 2. This regularizer is crucial for both mask learning and transfer learning, as it directly influences the magnitude of gradients during training. For instance, if certain layers are pruned to small magnitude, the gradients passed to their inputs will also diminish, thereby impeding mask learning and transfer to downstream tasks. In Table 3, we demonstrate the effectiveness of weight regularization under different scenarios, such as mask training, LLM fine-tuning after pruning, and transfer learning to downstream tasks. As will be elaborated in subsequent sections, the proposed regularization helps the learning of lossless masks for downstream tasks. We provide more analysis in Section of the Appendix.

Learned masks can losslessly adapt frozen LLMs to downstream tasks, offering 1.4 wall clock GPU speed up and 73% memory footprint. Large language models can achieve satisfactory quality across variety of tasks. In many cases, we are more interested in one particular ability of these large models under specific task, such as programming or translation, for which an LLM is over-parameterized. This naturally introduces new problem: can we learn mask for specific tasks to achieve lossless compression? To evaluate this, we learn masks for 2,000 steps separately on different domains and tasks and report the task-wise PPL in Table 4. We considered one-shot pruning as baselines, where we collected 256 samples from the task dataset for calibration. Results show that lossless masks can be learned for many tasks with our method. We also evaluated the power of transfer learning for downstream tasks in Table 5. To deploy sparse LLMs for single task, we can directly pick the pre-computed general mask from Table 1, or train an expert mask from scratch. However, both strategies show quality drop compared to the dense model (PPL=7.42) since they either allocate some capacity for other domains (PPL=10.61) or only see limited data from target domains (PPL=7.51). Our work leverages the general mask as prior and transfers it to the downstream tasks, which can produce lossless models (PPL=7.39). Updating parameters for downstream tasks results in additional copies of the model for each task, incurring higher storage costs. Learning masks alone allows for encoding task-specific masks with minimal space while keeping only single, shared copy of the original parameters. As shown in Table 6, task-specific masks only need 0.65 bits per parameter for storage on disk using simple arithmetic coding3 with static, uniform symbol distribution. For BS=1 inference on an A6000 GPU, 2:4 sparsity brings 1.4 acceleration and 27% reduction in the memory footprint (broader speedup results appear in Table 16 in the appendix)."

These figures show the relative L1 norm of pruned weights compared to the magnitude pruning baseline, which produces the largest weight norm after pruning. An interesting observation is that, even when initialized with magnitude prior, learnable method may still select some smaller values during pruning, resulting in 10% lower norm than magnitude pruning.

            "content": "Sensitivity Analysis with Learnable Method. In Figure 7, we analyze the sensitivity of LLaMA-2 7B using both the learnable and one-shot methods. For efficiency, we update the learnable masks for 500 steps and use Wikitext PPL as the metric. We observe similar trend in the learned masks and SparseGPT masks, suggesting that fast one-shot pruning method can reliably indicate sensitivity. Additionally, for 2:4 sparsity, the last layer is typically more sensitive than other layers. To maintain satisfactory results, we can keep the last layer dense, achieving good trade-off between efficiency and quality. In Table 15, we report the pruning results when few layers are kept dense.

In Table 16, we benchmark the throughput of LLaMA-2 7B with 2:4 sparsity on an A6000 GPU using TensorRT-LLM for batch size of 1. Throughput is evaluated as the number of tokens processed per second. Over variety of input and output lengths, 2:4 sparsity achieves an overall acceleration of 1.36 to 1.41 compared to the dense model. Input Len.

            "title": "I Mask Difference",
            "content": "In Figure 8, we visualize the differences between learned masks and one-shot masks, using SparseGPT as the prior for the learnable mask. We observe that SparseGPT and Wanda produce similar masks, with differences typically ranging from 5% to 10%, due to their similar pruning objectives. Our method, however, can produce distinct masks compared to these baselines, as shown in Figures 8a and 8b. Additionally, we find that weight regularization is crucial for effective mask learning. Without weight regularization, the vanished gradient can hinder mask learning, resulting in only 2.83% difference from the prior, as shown in Figure 8c. (a) Mask Difference on LLaMA-2 7B with regularization (b) Mask Difference on GPT-3 2B with regularization (c) Mask difference on LLaMA-2 7B without regularization. Figure 8: (a) & (b) Notable mask difference exists between learned masks and one-shot ones. (c) without sparse weight regularization, the vanished gradient caused by pruning will hinder mask training, leading to low difference between prior masks and learned masks. Limitations. In this work, we explore an end-to-end learning method for semi-structured pruning. Although our method yielded superior results, training LLMs with learnable masks inevitably consumes more resources compared to one-shot methods, which can produce masks efficiently. Improving the training efficiency of learnable masks is an important topic in future works. Broader Impacts. The technique proposed in this paper will not lead to negative societal impact. On the contrary, it offers significant benefits, including the reduction of energy costs and carbon emissions associated with the deployment of Large Language Models. By optimizing for Semi-structured (or N:M) Sparsity, our method reduces the computational resources required for inference, thereby contributing to more sustainable and environmentally friendly AI applications."
