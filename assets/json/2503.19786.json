Introduction We present the newest version of Gemma open language models (Gemma Team, 2024a), codesigned with the family of Gemini frontier models (Gemini Team, 2023). This new version comes in sizes comparable to Gemma 2 (Gemma Team, 2024b), with the addition of 1B model. These models are designed to run on standard consumer-grade hardware such as phones, laptops, and high-end GPUs. This version comes with several new abilities to the Gemma family; namely, multimodality, long context, and multilinguality, while preserving or surpassing the performance of prior versions. In terms of multimodality, most Gemma 3 models are compatible with tailored version of the SigLIP vision encoder (Zhai et al., 2023). The language models treat images as sequence of soft tokens encoded by SigLIP. We reduce the inference cost of image processing by condensing the vision embeddings into fixed size of 256 vectors. The encoder works at fixed resolution and we take inspiration from LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024) to enable flexible resolutions with Pan and Scan (P&S) method. The second main architectural improvement is an increase in context size to 128K tokens, without reducing performance. challenge with long context is the memory explosion of the KV cache during inference. To reduce this issue, we interleave multiple local layers between each global layer, and assign smaller span of only 1024 tokens to the local layers. Therefore, only the global layers attend to long context, and we have 1 global for every 5 local layers. The pre-training optimization recipe is similar to Gemma 2, with some modifications in the architecture design. We use the same tokenizer as Gemini 2.0, and we also revisit our data mixture to improve the multilingual capabilities of the models, while introducing image understanding. All Gemma 3 models are trained with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015). In post-training, we focus our efforts on improving mathematics, reasoning, and chat abilities, as well as integrating the new capabilities of Gemma 3, long-context, and image inputs. We use novel post-training approach that brings gains across all capabilities, including math, coding, chat, instruction following, and multilingual. The resulting Gemma 3 instruction-tuned models are both powerful and versatile, outperforming their predecessors by wide margin. In the following sections, we provide brief overview of our models, including the architecture and preand post-training recipes. We also provide detailed evaluations across wide variety of quantitative and qualitative benchmarks. We discuss our approach to safe and responsible deployment and outline the broader implications of Gemma 3, its limitations, and advantages. 1See Contributions and Acknowledgments section for full author list.

Our vocabulary has 256k entries. attention (Luong et al., 2015), with pattern of 5 local layers for every global layer, starting with local layer as the first layer of the model. Long context. Gemma 3 models support context length of 128K tokens, with the exception of the 1B model that has 32K. We increase RoPE base frequency from 10k to 1M on global self-attention layers, and keep the frequency of the local layers at 10k. We follow process similar to the positional interpolation of Chen et al. (2023) to extend the span of the global self-attention layers. 2.1. Vision modality Vision encoder. We use 400M variant of the SigLIP encoder (Zhai et al., 2023), Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy, 2020) trained with variation of the CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021). The Gemma vision encoder takes as input square images resized to 896 896, and is finetuned on data from visual assistant tasks. For simplicity, we share the vision encoder across our 4B, 12B, and 27B models, keeping it frozen during training. Pan & Scan (P&S). The Gemma vision encoder operates at fixed resolution of 896 896. This results in artifacts when processing non-square aspect ratios and high-resolution images, leading to unreadable text, or small objects disappearing. We address this issue with an adaptive windowing algorithm during inference. This algorithm segments images into non-overlapping crops of equal size, covering the whole image, and resize them to 896896 pixels to pass them to the encoder. This windowing is applied only when necessary, and control for the maximum number of crops. It is an inference-time only optimization and can be disabled for faster inference. 2 Figure 1 Example of visual interaction with Gemma 3 27B IT model. 2. Model Architecture Gemma 3 models follow the same general decoder-only transformer architecture as previous iterations (Vaswani et al., 2017), with most architecture elements similar to the first two Gemma versions. We use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023) with post-norm and pre-norm with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019). Inspired by Dehghani et al. (2023), Wortsman et al. (2023) and Chameleon Team (2024), we replace the soft-capping of Gemma 2 with QK-norm. In this section, we focus on some key differences from previous versions below. 5:1 interleaving of local/global layers.

Pre-training We follow similar recipe as in Gemma 2 for pre-training with knowledge distillation. Training data. We pre-train our models on slightly larger token budget than Gemma 2, i.e., we train on 14T tokens for Gemma 3 27B, 12T for the 12B version, 4T for the 4B, and 2T tokens for the 1B. The increase in tokens accounts for the mix of images and text used during pretraining. We also increase the amount of multilingual data to improve language coverage. We add both monolingual and parallel data, and we handle the imbalance in language representation using strategy inspired by Chung et al. (2023). Tokenizer. We use the same tokenizer as Gemini 2.0: SentencePiece tokenizer with split digits, preserved whitespace, and byte-level encodings (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). The resulting vocabulary has 262k entries. This tokenizer is more balanced for non-English languages. Filtering. We use filtering techniques that reduce the risk of unwanted or unsafe utterances and remove certain personal information and other sensitive data. We decontaminate evaluation sets from our pre-training data mixture, and reduce the risk of recitation by minimizing the proliferation of sensitive outputs. We also apply quality reweighing step inspired by Sachdeva et al. (2024) to reduce occurrences of low quality data. Distillation. We sample 256 logits per token, weighted by teacher probabilities. The student learns the teachers distribution within these samples via cross-entropy loss. The teachers target distribution is set to zero probability for nonsampled logits, and renormalized. 1B +KV 4B +KV 12B +KV 27B +KV 2.0 2.9 8.0 12.7 24.0 38. 54.0 72.7 Int4 Int4blocks=32 SFP8 1.0 0.7 0.5 1.9 1.6 1.4 2.6 7.3 6.6 21.5 14.1 32.8 2.9 7. 7.1 22.0 15.3 34.0 4.4 9.1 12.4 27.3 27.4 46.1 Table 3 Memory footprints (in GB) comparison between raw (bfloat16) and quantized checkpoints for weights and KV caching (+KV) at 32,768 context size, quantized in 8 bits. 2.3. Quantization Aware Training Along with the raw checkpoints, we also provide quantized versions of our models in different standard formats. These versions are obtained by finetuning each model for small number of steps, typically 5,000, using Quantization Aware Training (QAT) (Jacob et al., 2018). We use probabilities from the non-quantized checkpoint as targets, and adapt the data to match the pretraining and post-training distributions. Based on the most popular open source quantization inference engines (e.g. llama.cpp), we focus on three weight representations: per-channel int4, per-block int4, and switched fp8. In Table 3, we report the memory filled by raw and quantized models for each weight representation with and without KV-cache for sequence of 32k tokens. 2.4. Compute Infrastructure We train our models with TPUv4, TPUv5e, and TPUv5p as outlined in Table 2. Each model configuration is optimized to minimize training step time. For the vision encoder, we pre-compute the embeddings for each image and directly train with the embeddings, adding no cost to the training of the language models. The optimizer state is sharded using an implementation of ZeRO-3 (Ren et al., 2021). For multi-pod training, we perform data replica reGemma 3 Technical Report Context User turn Model turn End of turn Formatting <start_of_turn>user <start_of_turn>model <end_of_turn> Example of discussion: User: Who are you?

We use the single controller programming paradigm of Jax (Roberts et al., 2023) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022), along with the GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) and the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019). 3. Instruction-Tuning Pre-trained models are turned into instructiontuned models with an improved post-training approach compared to our prior recipe (see Table 6). Techniques. Our post-training approach relies on an improved version of knowledge distillation (Agarwal et al., 2024; Anil et al., 2018; Hinton et al., 2015) from large IT teacher, along with RL finetuning phase based on improved versions of BOND (Sessa et al., 2024), WARM (Ramé et al., 2024b), and WARP (Ramé et al., 2024a). Reinforcement learning objectives. We use variety of reward functions to improve helpfulness, math, coding, reasoning, instructionfollowing, and multilingual abilities, while minimizing model harmfulness. This includes learning from weight averaged reward models (Ramé et al., 2024b) trained with human feedback data, code execution feedback (Gehring et al., 2024), and ground-truth rewards for solving math problems (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Lambert et al., 2024). Data filtering. We carefully optimize the data used in post-training to maximize model performance. We filter examples that show certain personal information, unsafe or toxic model outputs, mistaken self-identification data, and duplicated examples. Including subsets of data that encourage better in-context attribution, hedging, and refusals to minimize hallucinations also improves performance on factuality metrics, without degrading model performance on other metrics. [BOS] token. For both PT and IT models, text starts with [BOS] token, that needs to be added explicitly since the text [BOS] does not map to the [BOS] token. For instance, Flax has an option, add_bos=True, to add this token automatically when tokenizing. An example of the formatting for an IT model is shown in Table 4, PT versus IT Formatting. All models share the same tokenizer, with some control tokens dedicated to IT formatting. key difference is that PT models output <eos> token at the end of generation, while IT models output <end_of_turn> at the end of the generation, as shown for IT in Table 4. Fine-tuning either model type thus also requires adding their respective end tokens. 4. Evaluation of final models In this section, we evaluate the IT models over series of automated benchmarks and human evaluations across variety of domains, as well as static benchmarks such as MMLU. 4.1. LMSYS Chatbot Arena In this section, we report the performance of our IT 27B model on LMSys Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) in blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters against other state-of-the-art models.

All the models are evaluated against each other through blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters. Each model is attributed score, based on the Elo rating system. Gemma-3-27B-IT numbers are preliminary results received on March 8, 2025. IT (1338) is among the top 10 best models, with score above other non-thinking open models, such as DeepSeek-V3 (1318), LLaMA 3 405B (1257), and Qwen2.5-70B (1257), which are much larger models. Finally, the Elo of Gemma 3 is significantly higher than Gemma 2, at 1220. Note that Elo scores do not take into account visual abilities, which none of the aforementioned models have. 4.2. Standard benchmarks follow third-party static leaderboards for fairer comparison across models. We include additional evaluations of our models on other benchmarks in the appendix. 5. Ablations In this section, we focus on the impact of our architecture changes, as well as some of the vision abilities new to this model. In Table 6, we show the performance of our final models across variety of benchmarks compared to our previous model iteration, and Gemini 1.5. We do not compare directly with external models that often report their own evaluation settings, since running them in our setting does not guarantee fair comparison. We encourage the reader to 5.1.

These plots are meant to give simplified summary and details are in the appendix. code, factuality, multilinguality, reasoning, and vision. The details of the performance across the different public benchmarks used in these plots are summarized in the appendix. Overall, we see that the new versions improve in most categories, despite the addition of vision. We particularly focus on multilinguality in this version, and this directly impacts the quality of our models. However, despite the use of decontamination techniques, there is always risk of contamination of these probes (Mirzadeh et al., 2024), making more definitive conclusions harder to assess. Figure 3 Impact of Local:Global ratio on the perplexity on validation set. The impact is minimal, even with 7-to-1 local to global. This ablation is run with text-only models. 5.2. Local:Global attention layers We measure the impact of changes to local and global self-attention layers on performance and memory consumption during inference. Local:Global ratio. In Fig. 3, we compare different ratios of local to global attention layers. 1:1 is used in Gemma 2 models, and 5:1 is used in Gemma 3. We observe minimal impact on perplexity when changing this ratio. In Fig. 4, we compare Sliding window size. different sliding window sizes for the local at6 Gemma 3 Technical Report tention layers in different global:local ratio configurations. The sliding window can be reduced significantly without impacting perplexity. Figure 6 KV cache memory versus context length. We show the memory usage of the KV cache for our architecture (L:G=5:1, sw=1024) and transformer with global attention only as used in LLaMa or Gemma 1. quences and then scale the 4B, 12B, and 27B models up to 128K tokens at the end of pre-training while rescaling RoPE (Chen et al., 2023). We find scaling factor of 8 to work well in practice. Note that compared to Gemma 2, we have also increased the RoPE base frequency of global selfattention layers from 10k to 1M, while keeping 10k for the local self-attention layers. In Figure 7, we show the impact on perplexity for different context lengths. Our models generalize to 128K, but rapidly degrade as we continue to scale. Figure 4 Impact of Sliding Window size on perplexity measured on validation set. We consider 2 2B models, with 1:1 and 1:3 local to global layer ratios. This ablation is run with text-only models. Impact on KV cache memory. In Fig. 5, we show the balance between the memory used by the model and the KV cache during inference with context of 32k tokens. The global only configuration is the standard configuration used across most dense models. The 1:1, sw=4096 is used in Gemma 2. We observe that the global only configuration results in memory overhead of 60%, while this is reduced to less than 15% with 1:3 and sliding windows of 1024 (sw=1024). In Fig. 6, we compute the memory used by the KV cache as function of the context length with either our 2B architecture (L:G=5:1, sw=1024) versus global only 2B model. Figure 5 Model versus KV cache memory during inference with pre-fill KV cache of size 32k. We consider 2B model with different local to global ratios and sliding window sizes (sw). We compare to global only, which is the standard used in Gemma 1 and Llama. This ablation is run with text-only model.

P&S enables capturing images at close to their native aspect ratio and image resolution. In Table 8, we compare our 27B IT model with and without P&S. As expected, the ability to treat images with close to native resolution greatly helps with tasks that require some form of reading text on images, which is particularly important for visual language models. Figure 8 Small versus large teacher. Relative difference of perplexity when using small and large teacher as function of the token size of training. Smaller numbers means distilling from larger teacher is better. We suspect this is because these studies are often performed in settings where the regularization effect of using worse teacher surpasses the benefit of using better teacher. We train student with 2 teachers of different sizes, one large and one small, for different training horizons. In Fig. 8, we observe that for short training horizons, the smaller teacher is better, but the trend is reversed for longer training. 5.5. Vision encoder"

We measure performance using short schedule 2B Gemma model on few evaluation benchmarks to observe the effect of input image resolution on vision encoder pre-training. Impact of image resolution. We use vision encoder based on SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023). The vision encoder is frozen, and only the language model is trained. Each image in this multimodal data is represented by 256 image tokens from the respective vision encoder. The higher resolution encoders thus use average pooling to reduce their output to 256 tokens. For instance, the 6. Memorization and Privacy Large language models may produce near-copies of some text used in training (Biderman et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2021, 2022; Ippolito et al., 2022; Nasr et al., 2023). Several prior reports have released audits that quantify this risk by measuring the memorization rate (Anil et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Gemini Team, 2023, 2024; Gemma Team, 2024a,b; LLaMa Team, 2024). This memorization rate1 is defined as the ratio of generations from the model that match its training data compared to all model generations using the following setup. We follow the methodology described in Gemma Team 1\"We do not state or imply [here] that model \"contains\" its training data in the sense that there is copy of that data in the model. Rather, model memorizes attributes of its training data such that in certain cases it is statistically able to generate such training data when following rules and using information about features of its training data that it does contain.\" 8 Gemma 3 Technical Report designed to have high recall and does not consider the context in which the information may appear, which leads to many false positives. Thus, we are likely overestimating the true amount of potentially personal information contained in the outputs classified as memorized. SDP also provides broad severity levels: low, medium, and high. We classify text as personal if SDP classifies it as personal information at any severity level. We observed no personal information in the outputs characterized as memorization for all Gemma 3 models. This indicates low rate of personal data, below our detection thresholds, in outputs classified as memorization. 7. Responsibility, Safety, Security Responsibility, safety, and security are of utmost importance in the development of Gemma models. To reduce risks to Gemma 3 users, we have continued to integrate enhanced internal safety processes that span the development workflow, in line with recent Google AI models (Gemini Team, 2024). This focuses on safety mitigation at training time, and robust and transparent model evaluations for the new image-to-text capabilities we have introduced. 7.1. Governance & Assessment Our approach to assessing the benefits and risks of Gemma is reflective of that outlined for Gemma 1 (Gemma Team, 2024a), taking into account the changes in supported modalities. We continue to believe that openness in AI can spread the benefits of these technologies across society, but must be evaluated against the risk of malicious uses that can cause harm on both individual and institutional levels (Weidinger et al., 2021). Since the inaugural Gemma launch, we have seen these models drive number of socially beneficial applications, such as our own ShieldGemma 2, 4B image safety classifier built with Gemma 3, which provides ready-made solution for image safety, outputting safety labels across dangerous content, sexually explicit, and violence categories. Releasing Gemma 3 models required specific attention to changes in model capabilities and Figure 9 Total memorization rates for both exact and approximate memorization. Gemma 3 models memorize significantly less than all prior models. *No results for approximate memorization on these models. (2024b) to measure it. Specifically, we subsample large portion of training data distributed uniformly across different corpora and test for discoverable extraction (Nasr et al., 2023) of this content using prefix of length 50 and suffix of length 50. We denote text as either exactly memorized if all tokens in the continuation match the source suffix or approximately memorized if they match up to an edit distance of 10%. Figure 9 compares the memorization rates across Gemma and Gemini models; these models are ordered in reverse chronological order, with the newest Gemma 3 models on the left. We find that Gemma 3 models memorize long-form text at much lower rate than prior models (note the log y-axis). We observe only marginal difference in the memorization rates between the 4B, 12B, and 27B models, with 1B memorizing less than these larger models. Further, we find that larger proportion of text is characterized as approximately memorized, with relative increase in approximate memorization compared to exact memorization of roughly 24x on average. We also study the rate at which the generations may contain personal information. To identify potentially personal information, we use the Google Cloud Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) service.2 SDP uses broad detection rules to identify text that may contain personal information. SDP is 2https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection Gemma 3 Technical Report close monitoring of the evolving risks of existing multimodal LLMs (Lin et al., 2024), as well as an understanding of the ways in which models are being used in the wild. Although we are yet to receive any reports of malicious use for Gemma, we remain committed to investigating any such reporting, and work with the academic and developer communities, as well as conduct our own monitoring, to flag such cases. Despite advancements in capabilities, we believe that, given the number of larger powerful open models available, this release will have negligible effect on the overall risk landscape. 7.2. Safety policies and train-time mitigations key pillar of Gemmas approach to safety is to align fine-tuned models with Googles safety policies, in line with Gemini models (Gemini Team, 2023). They are designed to help prevent our models from generating harmful content, i.e., Child sexual abuse and exploitation Revealing personally identifiable information that can lead to harm (e.g., Social Security numbers) Hate speech and harassment Dangerous or malicious content (including promoting self-harm or instructing in harmful activities) Sexually explicit content Medical advice that runs contrary to scientific or medical consensus We undertook considerable safety filtering of our pre-training data to reduce the likelihood of our pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints producing harmful content. For fine-tuned models, we also use both SFT and RLHF to steer the model away from undesirable behavior. rigorous risk assessment. Our internal safety processes are designed accordingly, and for previous Gemma models we have also undertaken evaluations of capabilities relevant to extreme risks (Phuong et al., 2024; Shevlane et al., 2023). As we continue to develop and share open models, we will follow the heuristic that thoroughly evaluating more capable model often provides sufficient assurance for less capable ones. As such, we prioritised streamlined set of evaluations for Gemma 3, reserving in-depth dangerous capability assessments for cases where specific model may present potentially heightened risk (as described below on CBRN evaluations). We balance development speed with targeted safety testing, ensuring our evaluations are well-focused and efficient, while upholding the commitments laid out in our Frontier Safety Framework."

Overall, Gemma 3 violation rate is significantly low overall on these safety policies. Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) knowledge Owing to enhanced performance on STEMrelated tasks, we evaluated knowledge relevant to biological, radiological, and nuclear risks using an internal dataset of closed-ended, knowledgebased multiple choice questions. For evaluations of chemical knowledge, we employed closedended knowledge-based approach on chemical hazards developed by Macknight et al. Our evaluation suggests that the knowledge of Gemma 3 models in these domains is low. 7.3. Assurance Evaluations We also run our IT models through set of baseline assurance evaluations to understand the potential harms that our models can cause. As we champion open models, we also recognize that the irreversible nature of weight releases requires 7.4. Our approach to responsible open models Designing safe, secure, and responsible applications requires system-level approach, working to mitigate risks associated with each specific use case and environment. We will continue to adopt assessments and safety mitigations proportionate to the potential risks from our models, and 10 Gemma 3 Technical Report will only share these with the community when we are confident that the benefits significantly outweigh the foreseeable risks. 8. Discussion and Conclusion In this work, we have presented Gemma 3, the latest addition to the Gemma family of open language models for text, image, and code. In this version, we focus on adding image understanding and long context while improving multilinguality and STEM-related abilities. Our model sizes and architectures are designed to be compatible with standard hardware, and most of our architecture improvements are tailored to fit this hardware while maintaining performance."

We fine-tune multimodal Gemma 3 pre-trained checkpoints following the protocol from Steiner et al. (2024) only learning rate is swept, otherwise the same transfer settings are used. The results in Table 12 show that Gemma 3 excels at benchmarks involving document understanding, even outperforming the larger PaliGemma 2 variant. Note that due to average pooling in the vision encoder the Gemma 3 4B and 12B models are about 10x cheaper to transfer compared with the PaliGemma 2 9B and 27B models at the same 896 896 resolution. Gemma 3 also performs better on AI2D and OKVQA, but PaliGemma 2 performs slightly better on VQAv2 and COCO caption. Multilinguality.
