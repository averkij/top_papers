Introduction The field of artificial intelligence, particularly large language or foundation models, has demonstrated remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning capabilities. Many popular benchmarks such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and the recently popular AIME have approached saturation, limiting their usefulness in differentiating model performances. The problems in these datasets often rely on limited set of techniques and do not always require the deep, multi-step reasoning needed to truly evaluate AI mathematical reasoning. Indeed, relying on final answer matching, even in recent benchmarks such as FrontierMath (Glazer et al., 2024) and Humanitys Last Exam (Phan et al., 2025), is not entirely reliable. It could lead to AI systems that are good at guessing answers but do not exhibit robust reasoning. To address these shortcomings, we propose IMO-Bench, suite of benchmarks that focus on robust reasoning at the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), the worlds most celebrated arena for young mathematicians. The IMO is selected due to its notoriously difficult Figure 1 IMO-Proof Bench, benchmark in IMOBench, for measuring proof-writing capabilities. We demonstrated high correlations between human and automatic evaluations on variety of public models, including our IMO-gold model.

All rights reserved Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning formulas. Such characteristics make IMO an excellent testbed for assessing reasoning capability. IMO-Bench covers three different tasks as summarized in Table 1 and all problems were vetted by panel of IMO medalists1 and mathematicians. Benchmark Size Task IMO-AnswerBench IMO-Proof Bench IMO-GradingBench 1000 Grade proof 400 Get the right answer 60 Write rigorous proof Table 1 Benchmarks in the IMO-Bench suite. The first benchmark, IMO-AnswerBench, consists of 400 problems with verifiable answers carefully chosen from past Olympiad competitions and then altered by experts to avoid memorization. Problems were chosen from variety of topics whose solutions require different problem solving techniques to ensure diverse representation of topics, ideas, and domain knowledge as illustrated in Figure 2. The second benchmark, IMO-Proof Bench, consists of 60 problems of varying difficulty levels, similar to those found at the IMO. While some problems have short answers, all require models to generate complete proofs. The benchmark is divided into two subsets, basic and advanced, each with 30 problems. While the basic set covers difficulty levels from pre-IMO up to IMO-Medium, problems in the advanced set are up to IMO-hard level and consist of 5 complete IMO sets, 3 of which are novel. We designed this benchmark to steer the communitys focus from final answers to proofs, enabling more rigorous assessment of AI reasoning processes. To ensure consistent evaluation, we include detailed grading schemes suitable for both human experts and automated systems. Figure 1 provides an early look into the potential of automatic graders for proofs. These two benchmarks played crucial role in the development of our Gemini Deep Think, leading to the historic achievement of the goldlevel performance at IMO 2025 (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Our IMO-gold model achieved an accuracy of 80.0% on IMO-AnswerBench by automatic evaluation, surpassing the best non-Gemini 1Together, they won 10 gold and 5 silver IMO medals. model and the best open-weight model by large margin of 6.9% and 19.2% respectively. The advanced IMO-Proof Bench is much more challenging. Our IMO-gold model scored 65.7%, whereas the best non-Gemini and the best open-weight models performed poorly with only 23.3% and 7.1% accuracy according to human evaluations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that automated graders for both answers and proofs, built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieve high correlation with expert human evaluations. Last but not least, we introduce IMOGradingBench, benchmark of 1000 solutions to problems in the advanced IMO-Proof Bench, together with grades from human experts. This resource is designed to foster progress in the automatic evaluation of long-form answers. We release IMO-Bench to the community and hope that it will spur further research towards advancing robust mathematical reasoning. 2. IMO-AnswerBench 2.1. Problem Selection 400 math problems were handpicked from various national, regional, and international Olympiad contests, spanning across four categories (Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory). For each category, the benchmark contains 100 problems across four levels of difficulty: pre-IMO (middle school or pre-Math Olympiad problems), IMO-Easy (equivalent to Problem 1 or Problem 4 at the IMO), IMO-Medium (equivalent to Problem 2 or Problem 5 at the IMO) and IMO-Hard (equivalent to Problem 3 or Problem 6 at the IMO or post-Math Olympiad problems). The difficulty breakdown for each category is listed in Table 2. Category Pre-IMO IMO-Easy IMO-Medium IMO-Hard Algebra Combinatorics Geometry Number Theory 11 4 13 2 46 19 44 20 32 31 32 31 11 46 11 47 Table 2 Difficulty statistics for IMO-AnswerBench. Problems with short answers were chosen so the correctness of models output can be quickly and reliably determined. Given the proof-heavy nature of many math Olympiad problems, we 2 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Figure 2 Topic distribution by category in IMO-AnswerBench. Number Theory and Combinatorics have the most topics which reflect the broad knowledge required to solve these problems while Geometry is mostly skewed towards angle and sidelength computation problems due to the nature of the short answer benchmark. perform an additional reformulation step for certain examples. This adjustment ensures that each problem yields clear and nontrivial short answer, thereby reducing ambiguity during solving and verification and confirming that models utilize nontrivial reasoning. See further details in A.4. 2.2. Problem Robustification To avoid data memorization, an additional step of problem modification is done via paraphrasing, changing the name of objects in the problem (such as changing point names for geometry problems), reformulating, modifying numerical values and/or adding distractors to the problem. This process is done either manually or automatically using language models. We highlight some examples in Table 8 and detail below. One example is an algebra problem from Austria Math Olympiad 2017. The problem is modified by making the substitution 𝑥 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑐, 𝑦 = 𝑏 + 𝑐 𝑎, and 𝑧 = 𝑐 + 𝑎 𝑏 for positive real numbers 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 with 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 being the lengths of the sides of some triangle to obtain the modified problem in the Robustified column. This modification uses the knowledge that 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 are lengths of triangle if and only if they satisfy the triangle inequalities 𝑎 + 𝑏 > 𝑐, 𝑎 + 𝑐 > 𝑏, and 𝑏 + 𝑐 > 𝑎. Another example is combinatorics problem from USA TST 2005. From the original statement, the problem is modified using several techniques such as modifying numerical values (by assigning specific value to the variable 𝑛 so that it is harder to guess the pattern), adding distractors (by introducing function or variables that are 3 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning not relevant to the problem), and adding layer of challenge that could confuse the models. 3. Going Beyond Short Answers with IMO-Proof Bench Experts also reformulated original problems into equivalent ones with completely different expressions. One such example is the Czech-Slovak Math Olympiad 2017 problem. We obtained robustified problem by transforming the governing equation and changing the objective from finding all possible values of 𝑘 to finding all even integers 𝑑 such that the number of solutions is even. 2.3. Answer autograder Even for the problems with short answers, automatic answer verification presents few substantial challenges. The difficulty arises from two main issues: (1) ensuring that model outputs adhere to parsable format and (2) evaluating semantically equivalent but syntactically different expressions.2 To circumvent this issue, benchmarks such as FrontierMath (Glazer et al., 2024) select problems with only numerical answers or mathematical objects that can be expressed as SymPy objects. However, this approach narrows the scope of evaluable problems and reduces robustness of the benchmark to minor formatting or syntax errors. To address these limitations, we use large language models as automated verifiers for model answers on IMO-AnswerBench. We name this approach, AnswerAutoGrader, which is built by prompting the public Gemini 2.5 Pro model to extract final answers from generated solutions and assess their correctness against ground truths (See A.5 for the full prompt). This method allows much more flexibility in acceptable answer formats and improves the overall robustness of our benchmark. As we demonstrate in Section 5.1, AnswerAutoGraders performance is nearly identical to that of human evaluators, validating its use for future public usage and also for reporting the results in this work. 2For example, given the ground truth answer \"(, 4) (4, )\", the answer \"all real numbers except -4\" should also be graded as correct. While the final answer accuracy provided by IMOAnswerBench offers valuable metric for measuring mathematical abilities, it is insufficient for comprehensive assessment of mathematical reasoning. final answer can be correct while the full solution contains flawed reasoning. Furthermore, many IMO-level competition problems do not come with final short answer. Even in cases where short answer exists, guessing the correct short answer is often significantly easier than rigorously deriving the solution. IMO-Proof Bench is designed to evaluate the ability of AI models to construct comprehensive and valid mathematical arguments. This benchmark consists of 60 proof-based problems, curated to mirror the kinds of problems found in the IMO. While some problems may have concise numerical answers, models are only given credit if they produce correct and relevant reasoning steps. This benchmark is essential for assessing an AIs underlying reasoning process, its ability to apply mathematical principles, and its capacity to formulate coherent and logical arguments. 3.1. Benchmark setup The benchmark is divided into two subsets: basic set covering pre-IMO to IMO-Medium difficulty levels, and an advanced set featuring novel, highly challenging problems simulating complete IMO examinations, up to IMO-Hard level. The basic problem set primarily consists of rephrased versions of existing problems. Since standard IMO problems may be too challenging for most of current models, the basic set is designed to assess models in their early stages of development. Sufficiently strong performance on the basic set would justify progression to the advanced set. The advanced problem set features 30 problems in the style and difficulty of the IMO. The collection includes 18 novel problems crafted by IMO medalists, alongside 12 problems from recent top-tier competitions: 6 robustified from IMO 2024 and 6 directly from USAMO 2025. Table 10 provides examples of such robustified problems. Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning IMO-Proof Bench uses an evaluation framework designed for both simplicity and precision. We provide primary grading guideline with four ratings (Correct, Almost, Partial, Incorrect) as detailed in Table 3. While this rubric offers clear and consistent baseline, we do not restrict our expert evaluators to these four values. To allow for more nuanced assessments, human experts are empowered to use their own judgments to assign any integer score from 0 to 7 for each problem. Category IMO Points Solution quality Correct Almost Partial Incorrect 7 6 1 Fully correct, rigorous, and complete Almost correct, minor errors Mostly incorrect, some relevant results Completely incorrect or irrelevant. Table 3 Our simplified IMO ratings. 3.2. Proof Autograder While human expert evaluation remains the gold standard for mathematical proofs, its cost and time intensity limit scalable research. To address this, we built ProofAutoGrader, an automatic grader for IMO-Proof Bench. The autograder leverages Gemini 2.5 Pro, providing it with prompt containing the problem statement, the candidate solution, reference solution, and specific grading guidelines (see Appendix B.5). Automatic evaluation for informal proofs is highly intricate task, and current systems are not yet perfect substitute for human experts-a key distinction from AnswerAutoGrader, whose purpose is primarily format matching. For this reason, all primary results in this paper are based on expert human evaluation to ensure all results are absolutely correct. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate in Section 5.3, we prove our autograder can be reasonable proxy, establishing it as reasonable tool for the community to assess future models on IMO-Proof Bench. developing reliable automated grading systems and improving general mathematical reasoning. As part of our IMO effort (Luong and Lockhart, 2025), we have benchmarked extensively many internal models on the advanced set of IMO-Proof Bench using human evaluations. These human gradings led to the creation of IMOGradingBench with 1000 examples, each containing problem statement, proposed solution, and its human-assigned grade (on 07 scale). To reduce noise from fine-grained scoring, we frame the evaluation as four-way classification by mapping the given IMO points to the labels (Correct, Almost, Partial, Incorrect) as detailed in Table 3. To ensure robust evaluation, the dataset has been balanced with roughly equal number of examples per category. Figure 3 illustrates that when problems are grouped by their IMO difficulties, clear trend emerges. The proportion of correct and almost solutions decreases as the intended difficulty moves from IMO-easy to IMO-hard, while the proportion of incorrect and partial solutions increases. This confirms that the grading distribution of IMO-GradingBench aligns with its assigned difficulty levels. See further discussions in Section C.1. Figure 3 Grade distribution for solutions in IMO-GradingBench by difficulty levels (IMO-Hard, IMO-Medium, IMO-Easy). 4. IMO-GradingBench 5.

We also analyze the performances of models on the original problems, before robustification, summarized in Table 9. As anticipated, we find robustification leads to consistent drop in performance across all models. Lastly, we validate the reliability of AnswerAutoGrader by comparing it with expert human labels.

The Advanced IMO-Proof Bench is further broken down by problem source. Robustified IMO 2024 problem set, see Section 3. An attempt to query Grok 4 (heavy) on 2025-08-13 was unsuccessful due to model instability (only 5 of 30 problems responded with 3 attempts). 𝑘Scores indicate that there were 𝑘 problems that were treated as incorrect (a score of 0) because of query failures (for at least 3 times). IMO-Proof Bench varies significantly; while most models score below 60%, Gemini Deep Think (IMO Gold) achieves high score of 89.0%. The performances of other frontier models such as Qwen3-235B (33.3%) and GPT-5 (59.0%) show there is still considerable room for improvements. The advanced IMO-Proof Bench proves to be more significant challenge that all non-Gemini models score below 25%. Our Gemini Deep Think (IMO Gold) model achieved score of 65.7%, surpassing the best non-Gemini model (Grok 4 (heavy)) by large margin of 42.4%. This represents substantial leap in capability, but its distance from perfect score indicates that even the strongest models have room for growth in sophisticated mathematical reasoning. breakdown of the advanced IMO-Proof Bench reveals significant performance disparity across problem types, suggesting potential overfitting in certain models. This trend is most evident with Grok 4 (heavy), which scores 76.2% on USAMO 2025 but only 11.1% on novel problems. Other models, including o3 (52.4% vs. 15.1%) and Gemini 2.5 Pro with (Huang & Yang, 2025) (52.4% vs. 17.5%), exhibit similar, pronounced gap. In contrast, Gemini Deep Think (IMO Gold) scored 69.0% on the USAMO and 61.1% on the novel sets, indicating it has more general capabilities (Deep Think team, 2025) without overfitting to particular dataset. The low performances of latest frontier models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4 (heavy) on the advanced IMO-Proof Bench underscore the difficulty of advanced mathematical reasoning and highlight the importance of rigorous examination the full details of model outputs for complete understanding of their mathematical abilities. 5.3. Autograder for IMO-Proof Bench To assess the feasibility of using automatic graders for proofs, we apply ProofAutoGrader to the 14 public models  (Table 6)  , which were previously graded by human experts on IMO-Proof Bench. Figure 1 shows that the average grades from ProofAutoGrader highly correlate with human grades, yielding high Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.96 and 0.93 on both basic and advanced problems respectively. 7 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Figure 4 Correlation between ProofAutoGrader and human experts on the advanced IMOProof Bench, evaluated over 170 internal models on our IMO-gold journey. In addition, we also visualized, in Figure 4, the performance of ProofAutoGrader on 170 internal systems, developed as part of our IMO effort (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). On this larger pool, our automatic grader achieved lower, but still reasonable Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87. To better understand the grading agreement, we visualize, in Figure 5, the confusion matrix of all human and automatic gradings on the 14 public models (for total of 840 model solutions). We observed that most common misclassifications happened between the Incorrect and Partial classes. Overall, ProofAutoGrader shows reasonable performance, exhibiting high correlation with human experts, and also shows potential in identifying nuances that might be overlooked by human graders. On the other hand, detailed analysis with persolution breakdowns further reveals that ProofAutoGrader occasionally still has weaknesses such as failures to identify high-level logical errors or being overly punitive for unconventional yet correct solutions. Specific examples are highlighted in appendix B.6. Therefore, while we hope that ProofAutoGrader can serve as valuable tool for the community to evaluate models on IMO-Proof Bench, we recommend that it augments human verification to guarantee the accuracy of individual grading results. 5.4. IMO-GradingBench The IMO-GradingBench measures the ability of models in assessing the quality of proof when provided with only problem statements and model-generated solutions, without any reference solutions or specific grading guidelines. We measure model performances under two metrics: 1. Accuracy human gradings on 7-point scale are first converted to 4 categories (Correct, Almost, Partial, Incorrect) corresponding to 4 buckets (7, 6-4, 3-1, 0). The categorized human gradings are then compared with modelpredicted categories. 2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) modelpredicted categories are converted from (Correct, Almost, Partial, Incorrect) to IMO scores (7, 6, 1, 0) according to Table 3.

On this metric, Gemini Deep Think (IMO Gold) achieved the best MAE score of 18.4%, indicating that there is still significant room for improvement3. Comparison with ProofAutoGrader Model performances on IMO-GradingBench are notably worse than what might be expected from the strong performance of ProofAutoGrader, in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients as reported in Section 5.3. This discrepancy stems from two key methodological distinctions. 1. First, ProofAutoGrader performance was measured on scores aggregated over 30 problems, which smooths out noise from individual grading variations, unlike the per-instance evaluation of IMO-GradingBench. 2. Second, the IMO-GradingBench evaluation provides models with minimal contextonly the problem and the proposed solution; whereas for ProofAutoGrader on IMOProof Bench, we additionally provide both reference solutions and grading guidelines."

            "content": "distinctions explain why IMOGradingBench with per-instance, minimal-context evaluation is challenging benchmark; whereas aggregated assessments by ProofAutoGrader on IMO-Proof Bench can still yield robust model rankings. 3Because of our simplified gradings (7, 6, 1, 0), the best possible grader will achieve golden MAE of 3.9% on IMOGradingBench, instead of 0%. In recent years, harder reasoning math benchmarks have been proposed as performance on existing benchmarks becomes saturated. For example, Olympiad Bench (He et al., 2024) and Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024) contain questions at the Olympiad level across diverse domains, while Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025) evaluates knowledge across many domains. Other benchmarks include Brainteaser (Han et al., 2025), which consists of long-form brainteaser puzzles, and Frontier Math (Glazer et al., 2024), which contains hard math questions and hidden evaluation set. MiniF2F (Zheng et al., 2021) provides benchmark for evaluating formal proofs around Olympiad-level difficulty. Reward Bench (Lambert et al., 2024) provides benchmark to evaluate reward models. HARDMath (Fan et al., 2024) presents challenging math benchmark containing applied mathematics problems that require analytical approximation techniques. The AlphaGeometry papers (Chervonyi et al., 2025; Trinh et al., 2024) provide benchmarks of 80 IMO and IMO Shortlist Euclidean geometry problems from 2000 to 2024, written in domain-specific language. In contrast, IMO-Bench provides suite for evaluating advanced mathematical reasoning with short answer matching and rigorous proof evaluation in natural language across wide variety of Math Olympiad areas. As performance on math benchmarks continues to improve, robustness benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate potential overfitting and obtain better estimates of models true reasoning capabilities. These benchmarks have shown that simply perturbing benchmark questions is enough to significantly hurt performance compared to the original problems. SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) generated perturbed benchmark for word math problems, whereas Lila (Mishra et al., 2022) contained perturbations across diverse range of reasoning questions. The functional variant of the MATH benchmark (Srivastava et al., 2024) demonstrated large performance drops across models when varying existing problems. Putnam-AXIOM (Gulati et al., 2024) similarly shows that perturbing Putnam 9 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning questions causes significant drop in model performance. MATH-Perturb (Huang et al., 2025) also adds simple perturbations to math questions (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and shows model performance drops, raising concerns about memorization. Lightman et al. (2024) propose an alternative strategy to improve model robustness by supervising the reasoning process from start to finish, rather than solely on the final outcome. This approach led to improved performance on the MATH dataset. IMO-Bench contributes to robust mathematical reasoning with already modified questions in IMO-AnswerBench, rigorous proof requirements in IMO-Proof Bench, and the task of proof grading in IMO-GradingBench. 7. Conclusion This paper introduced IMO-Bench, comprehensive suite of benchmarks for robust evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities, including IMO-AnswerBench for short answer matching, IMO-Proof Bench for full proof correctness, and IMO-GradingBench for proof verification. The three benchmarks demonstrated that frontier models struggle on IMO-Bench problems and that getting the short answers right does not necessarily equate to correct mathematical reasoning for most models. Furthermore, we have developed and validated automated graders for both answers and proofs. Our AnswerAutoGrader achieves near-human accuracy (98.9%) , while ProofAutoGrader shows strong correlation (0.93-0.96 %) with expert human scores. These tools along with IMOGradingBench provide scalable and reliable method for the community to evaluate future models, even as human expertise remains the gold standard for high-stakes evaluation. By releasing IMO-Bench4 to the research community, we aim to shift the communitys focus from mere answer-getting to the development of deep, verifiable, and robust reasoning processes. We hope this suite will serve as valuable tool to measure and drive progress toward more advanced and reliable artificial intelligence."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Our work has two primary limitations: evaluation cost and the risk of data contamination. Evaluation Cost. While our automatic grader, ProofAutoGrader, correlates strongly with human scores, it is not perfect substitute and can introduce noise. Consequently, definitive assessments still require verification by human experts, who are both costly and difficult to source. Future Data Contamination. The second limitation is the risk of long-term data contamination. As IMO-Bench is publicly released, its problems and solutions will likely be scraped and absorbed into future training datasets. This threatens the integrity of the benchmark, as models may achieve high scores by memorizing answers rather than demonstrating genuine reasoning. Preventing this form of benchmark decay remains significant, field-wide challenge. A. IMO-AnswerBench A.1. Examples We show examples of IMO-AnswerBench in Table 8. A.2. Subject Distribution and Robustification Examples of IMO-AnswerBench At the IMO, the problems are typically classified into four main categories: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry and Number Theory. Therefore, we also structure our IMO-AnswerBench in accordance to these four categories as well, where each category has exactly 100 problems. Algebra is one of the core competencies for Math Olympiad students and appears at all levels of competitions. Distinct from previous benchmarks (Hendrycks et al., 2021), IMO-Bench puts more emphasis on Math Olympiad topics, including inequalities, polynomials (including polynomial equations and factorization), functional equations, sequence problems and advanced topics such as Algebraic Number Theory. Combinatorics problems, despite requiring seemingly basic insights, are notoriously challenging. Successfully solving them serves as strong indicator of models reasoning capabilities. The combinatorics set of this benchmark contains problems covering Graph Theory, Enumerative Combinatorics (combinatorial counting problems), Extremal Combinatorics, Existence Combinatorics (problems asking the existence of certain combinatorial objects), Additive Combinatorics, Set Combinatorics, Tiling, Combinatorial Geometry, Operations (problems involving operations, often requiring finding invariant or monovariant properties), and Game Theory. Geometry problems at the IMO are well-known for their visual elegance. While there are several existing geometry benchmarks (Hendrycks et al., 2021), they do not cover Math Olympiad level problems. To address this discrepancy, IMO-Bench contains geometry problems with short answers spanning subcategories such as angle and sidelength computation, locus problems, and proof-based geometry problems, as well as unconventional categories such as 3D geometry and combinatorial geometry. Additionally, we would like to note that most Math Olympiad level geometry problems are proof-based, and so designing Math Olympiad level short-answer benchmark for geometry is highly non-trivial. Number Theory problems typically consist of problems involving objects and properties derived from integers and arithmetic functions, spanning various topics such as Diophantine equations, divisibility problems, polynomials, sequence problems, functional equation problems on the set 13 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Subj.

These problems serve as good representation of Math Olympiad problems at various levels and across different national, regional and international contests, as well as the topics covered in these contests. strong model performance would suggest high competence level as well as good knowledge coverage since certain problems can only be solved with particular problem solving strategy, without which the model would struggle to provide rigorous with the correct answer. 14 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning A.3. Effects of robustification To examine the effect of robustification for IMO-AnswerBench, we also evaluate on the original, unmodified problems and present the results in Table 9. The models perform significantly better on the original problems, where the gap could be as high as 11.2% for o4-mini (high reasoning). This indicates that our robustification effort does create significant challenge for the models.

Results are averaged over 8 samples. A.4. Towards Consistent Problem Statements and Answer Evaluation Another common issue with language models solving complex Math Olympiad problems is that these models often misinterpret the statement of such problems, or the problem formulation leads the models to produce unintended outputs. Thus, we employ several additional strategies on top of robustification to ensure that the models can interpret the problems properly as follows. Instead of asking for series of numbers satisfying certain conditions (which is hard to verify), we instead reformulate the problem so that its answer is unique number that is the sum or some other non-trivial function of many inputs. Simplifying the answer as much as possible to avoid confusion. Being more specific with the problem statement to excuse possible issues with special characters, such as angle degrees in geometry problems. Avoiding questions with binary answers (yes/no), such as existence questions (which are extremely common in Math Olympiad contests), as they can be guessed without solving the problem or proving the result rigorously. Instead, we will reformulate the problem in such way that it would produce non-trivial answer. A.4.1. Ensuring unique non-trivial answer Example 1 In this example, instead of asking the model to characterize all such numbers 𝑚, we ask the model to compute certain expression, which results in 1012, value that the model is unlikely to guess by mere chance. Original problem: \"For positive integer 𝑚, let 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑚+1 satisfy 3𝑖 < 𝑎𝑖 < 3𝑖+1 for each 𝑖. Find the maximum and minimum possible values of (cid:214) 1𝑥𝑚+1 𝑦𝑥 𝑎𝑥 𝑎𝑦 1 𝑎𝑥 𝑎𝑦 .

Modified answer: 4151879777 Example 3 In this example, instead of asking the model to characterize all such numbers 𝑚, we ask the models to count the number of such numbers in certain range, which results in 1009, value that the model is unlikely to guess by mere chance. Original problem: Find all positive integers 𝑚 2 that satisfy the following condition: For any 𝑚 distinct positive integers (𝑛1, . . . , 𝑛𝑚), at least one of the following two conditions holds: 𝑛1 + . . . + 𝑛𝑚 is multiple of 𝑚, or there exists permutation (𝑘1, . . . , 𝑘𝑚) such that 𝑘1 + 2𝑘2 + . . . + 𝑚𝑘𝑚 is multiple of 𝑚. Original answer: All powers of 2 and all odd numbers Modified problem: Find the number of all positive integers 2 𝑚 2000 that satisfy the following condition: For any 𝑚 distinct positive integers (𝑛1, . . . , 𝑛𝑚), at least one of the following two conditions holds: 𝑛1 + . . . + 𝑛𝑚 is multiple of 𝑚, or there exists permutation (𝑘1, . . . , 𝑘𝑚) such that 𝑘1 + 2𝑘2 + . . . + 𝑚𝑘𝑚 is multiple of 𝑚. 16 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Modified answer: 1009 A.4.2. Answer simplification Example In the example below the original answer mixes notations and adds potentially confusing quantifier, so we simplify it. Original Problem: Let 𝑃 be function from the set of integers to itself such that for all integers ℎ, 𝑚, 𝑃ℎ2+𝑚2 (ℎ + 𝑚 1) = 𝑚𝑃(𝑚 1) + ℎ𝑃(ℎ 1) + (ℎ + 𝑚 1). Find all possible functions 𝑃. Original answer: 𝑃 1 or 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥 + 1 for all 𝑥 ℤ. Modified/simplified answer: 𝑃(𝑥) = 1, 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥 + 1 A.4.3. Handling geometric quantities Example For geometry, if the model is asked to find an angle, we make sure to include in degrees in the problem statement. This prevents problems mixing radians and degrees and model misinterpretations of special characters marking degrees such as ˆo or ˆ { circ}. A.4.4. Reformulating questions with binary answers Example Below is an interesting example where the problem is very difficult but the answer is binary yes/no, which can be guessed without solving the problem. Therefore, instead of asking the model to show existence, we ask the model to find the smallest positive integer to satisfy such property, which retains the difficulty level while preventing the model from guessing the answer. Original problem: Is there positive integer 𝑛 such that (𝑎+𝑏) (𝑏+𝑐) (𝑐+𝑎)+𝑎+𝑏+𝑐 = 𝑛 for infinitely many 𝑎𝑏𝑐 integer triples (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)? Original answer: It exists Modified problem: Find the smallest positive integer 𝑛 such that there exists infinitely many triple (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) of distinct positive integers such that (𝑎+𝑏) (𝑏+𝑐) (𝑐+𝑎)+𝑎+𝑏+𝑐 = 𝑛. 4𝑎𝑏𝑐 Modified answer: 3 A.5.

Examples We show robustified examples of IMO-Proof Bench in Table 10. B.2. Proof Evaluation Guidelines for IMO-Proof Bench In proof-based problem, the desired conclusion usually is either already given (\"Prove that ...\") or easy to guess (\"Determine with proof whether ...\"). Evaluating solution consists of verifying that each logical step leading to the conclusion is valid. However, grading informal6 proofs contains inherently subjective elements, such as deciding whether particular claim is justified in sufficient detail. Thus, unlike for short answers, which are either correct or incorrect, it is more appropriate to evaluate proofs on higher resolution scale, where subjective elements matter less. Additionally, solution may make partial progress by proving some but not all of the steps of full solution. It is important to capture this during evaluation. Traditionally, proof-based Math Olympiad competitions, such as the IMO, score solutions on 7-point scale. For each problem, grading rubric outlines how many points are to be awarded for certain partial results. The great majority of solutions receive polarizing score: either 5-7 points for being essentially correct, or 0-2 points if the problem remains unsolved, generally dictated by specific criteria in the rubric. Although problems often admit multiple solutions, it is rare for solution to be so novel that it falls completely outside of the rubric (which usually covers the 1-2 most common solution approaches). Thus, despite some elements of subjectivity as mentioned above, scores are typically quite consistent across graders. For further insight into how Math Olympiad grading works, refer to Chen (2023). B.3. Details of Gemini 2.5 Pro with (Huang & Yang, 2025) We use the exact agentic framework proposed in (Huang and Yang, 2025), which has been open sourced at https://github.com/lyang36/IMO25 and also contains exact hyperparameters in its binary flags. We used the same thinking budget (32K tokens) per model call as mentioned in the paper. Given an initial solution, single pipeline consists of repeated iterations (at most 30) of selfverification and bug-fixing on it. Specifically, if the current solution passes self-verification fixed number (5) of times, then the solution is returned, but if at any time self-verification does not 6i.e. written in natural language, as opposed to formal language such as LEAN. 19 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning pass, then the model is instructed to observe any mistakes (bugs) and fix them, and restart the self-verification process. Note that if consecutive number (10) of verifications fail, then the pipeline exits without solution. This entire pipeline will be run in parallel multiple times (100) as well, until there is at least one solution returned from any run. Theoretically the model could fail to find any solution after all parallel runs, which occurred for two IMO-Proof Bench (Advanced) problems. B.4. Common Model Mistakes Here we list some common mistakes the models were making according to the graders. B.4.1. Polynomial Assumption PB-Basic-004: We want to find all strictly increasing functions ℝ ℝ such that: 1. 𝑔 is surjective. 2. 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥, 𝑥 ℝ. common mistake that language models typically make while solving problems is assuming strong assumptions on the problem without legitimate or substantial justification for the assumptions. An instance of this behavior is the functional equation problem PB-Basic-004 as shown in Table 11. The proof of o3 on this problem begins by considering the linear cases. \"We wish to find all strictly increasing and surjective functions 𝑔 : ℝ ℝ satisfying 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥 for all 𝑥 ℝ. natural first step is to check if linear function works. Suppose 𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 ....\" After figuring out 𝑎 = 5 and 𝑏 = 0, the model claims that it found the unique solution, even though the only cases it checked were when 𝑔 is linear. \".... Thus, the unique solution is 𝑔(𝑥) = 5𝑥.\" While the final answer is indeed correct, which typical short answer benchmark would consider correct, the proof is not rigorous and would get little to no points in proof-based competition such as the IMO. B.4.2. Final Answer Guessing PB-Basic-005: Let 𝑃 be polynomial with real coefficients whose leading coefficient is 1. Suppose that for all nonzero real numbers 𝑥, we have 𝑃(𝑥) + 𝑃(1/𝑥) = 𝑃 (𝑥+1/𝑥 )+𝑃 (𝑥1/𝑥 ) . Determine all possibilities for 𝑃. In addition, there are the examples where models try to guess the final answer by inspecting the cases when the variables are small. They do not try to actually prove why the guessed answer is correct. In the example problem PB-Basic-005, the model does case work with degree 𝑛 = 2 and 20 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning degree 𝑛 = 4 and guesses the answer is 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥2 and 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥4 + 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏 without showing these are correct answers (in fact, the correct answer should have been 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑎(𝑥4 + 6) + 𝑏𝑥2) nor that these are all the answers. That being said, the models often can get lot of correct answers by simply guessing rather than carrying out elaborate derivations to arrive at the correct answer. For more information, we refer the readers to the full example in Table 11. B.4.3. Commonly Missed Easy Problems Among many problems that models were not able to solve, we present here the following two pre-IMO difficulty problems from Proof Bench-basic. PB-Basic-008, (Modified) All-Russia MO 2002: Let 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 be positive reals such that 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 = 1, prove that 3(𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏𝑐 + 𝑐𝑎). 𝑐 3 𝑎 + 𝑏 + This problem is standard symmetric homogeneous inequality in three variables, whose equality condition is 𝑎 = 𝑏 = 𝑐. This is one of the easiest type of inequalities one could encounter in high school level math competition. However, not single model we tested got even partial score on this one. PB-Basic-016, (Modified) USAMO 1994 Problem 2: 101 stones are arranged in circle, numbered 1 through 101 in order (so that stone 1 is next to stone 101). Each stone is painted either red, white, or blue. Initially, stone 101 is the only blue stone. Among the remaining stones, even-numbered stones are red, and odd-numbered stones are white. We perform sequence of modifications to the coloring, where in each step, we may choose stone and repaint it different color, as long as we ensure that no two adjacent stones are ever the same color. Prove that it is not possible to eventually reach state where again stone 101 is the only blue stone, but among the remaining stones, all even-numbered stones are white and all odd-numbered stones are red. This is standard, easy combinatorics problem that uses the invariance principle. One is required to test various quantities related to the problem, and find an invariant quantity to solve the problem. In this case, the difference between the number of blue followed by white and the number of white followed by blue is invariant. However, no model found any invariant that is related to the problem. B.5. Query prompt for ProofAutoGrader The following prompt was used to query ProofAutoGrader for IMO-Proof Bench You are an expert grader for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). Your task is to evaluate proposed solution strictly and rigorously. Keep in mind the standards at the IMO are extremely high: only arguments that are logically sound, complete, and precise should be rewarded. ### General Scoring Rubric Scores are assigned on 0-7 scale. The general guidelines are: * **7 Points (Correct):** The solution is complete, correct, and fully rigorous. If the submission contains incorrect attempts or lines of reasoning but ultimately presents complete and correct 21 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning solution, it should still be awarded full points; the presence of earlier, discarded work does not detract from the final correct proof. * **6 Points (Almost Correct):** The solution is almost correct with sound core argument, but contains minor errors in calculation or small gaps in logic. Missing proofs for major components, unjustified claims, or sketchy arguments are **not** eligible for 6 points. * **1 Point (Partial Progress):** The solution demonstrates substantial progress explicitly mentioned in the grading guidelines. without making substantive headway, or proving partial results not mentioned in the grading guidelines are generally **not** eligible for this score. Initial observations, reformulating the problem * **0 Points (Incorrect):** The solution doesnt make substantial progress that is key step in the full solution or is fundamentally flawed. or lacking rigor also fall in this category."

Limitations of ProofAutoGrader Despite high correlation with human grades, ProofAutoGrader still has several systematic errors and limitations, including general tendency to overestimate scores, occasional failure to identify highlevel logical errors, and being prone to be overly punitive for minor formatting issues or unconventional yet correct solutions. We demontrate specific examples of these behavior in Table 12. In PB-Basic 002, the model solution makes logical error by asserting 2(4 4 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡) 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡 directly from 𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 + 𝑡 4 4 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡 and 2(𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 + 𝑡) 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡. This comes from an incorrect assumption that if 𝐴 𝐵 and 𝐴 𝐶, then 𝐵 𝐶. Such \"specious\" errors, while seemingly plausible and easy to overlook without deep understanding of the problem, are critical and can invalidate an entire solution. ProofAutoGrader often fails to identify such deceptive logical inconsistencies. In PB-Basic 027, the model produces novel solution entirely different from the established ground truth and grading guidelines. The solution was largely correct, but its Key Lemma omits critical condition that the segment 𝑃𝑄 must have fixed slope. While the lemma is false as stated, supplying this condition makes its proof an immediate consequence of homothety. Since the rest of the solution is complete, the human grader awarded it 6 out of 7 points. However, because the lemma is technically incorrect, ProofAutoGrader marks the entire solution as wrong. This case demonstrates that ProofAutoGrader struggles to identify partial progress in solutions not anticipated by the grading guidelines, leading to overly punitive assessments for minor issues. C. IMO-GradingBench C.1. Grade distribution for IMO-GradingBench This section presents the human-assigned grade distribution for the IMO-GradingBench benchmark. As shown in Figure 6, the aggregate count of correct versus incorrect grades across the entire dataset 23 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Figure 6 Grade distribution across examples in IMO-GradingBench is balanced. However, the distribution of grades (correct, almost, partial, incorrect) is not uniform on perproblem basis. This variance is expected as it reflects the natural distribution of scores that proofevaluation models will encounter in grading solutions, as problems inherently differ in difficulty. C.2. Query Prompt This section details the prompts used for the three evaluation settings in IMO-GradingBench. common definition of the scoring criteria is used across all settings, inserted into the prompts as indicated by {SCORING_CRITERIA}. C.3. Grader Prompt The following prompt was used for the vanilla setting: Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Carefully analyze the given problem statement and the proposed solution, and then write out your analysis regarding the correctness of the proposed solution. After the analysis, you must provide score based on the following criteria: incorrect: The solution is completely incorrect or irrelevant. partial: The solution is partially correct but has significant errors or omissions. almost: The solution is almost correct but contains minor errors or inaccuracies. correct: The solution is fully correct and complete. The very last part of your response must be only one of the following words: incorrect, partial, almost, or correct. Problem:{problem} Solution:{solution} C.4. Label extraction prompt The following prompt was used to extract the label from model response for IMO-GradingBench. Note that in the majority of cases, the last word of the model (grader) response is one of incorrect, partial, almost, or correct. As result, we first use python to extract the model grades. We only use prompting to extract the model grades when the last word in the model response is empty or is some different words. ## Instructions for Extracting Final Scores **Objective:** Given an response of an evaluation prompt, extract the final score presented within the response and format it specifically. **Process:** 1. **Analyze the response:** Scan the response to identify the final score provided by the evaluator. 2. **Extract and format the final answer:** Present the extracted score on new line, preceded exactly by \"Final answer: \". **Formatting Rules:** * **Evaluation Categories:** The expected output must be one of the following categories: incorrect, or not found. correct, partial, almost, * **Score Identification:** The extraction is based on identifying the keyword used by the evaluator to summarize their conclusion. The criteria associated with these keywords are: * **incorrect:** The evaluator concluded that the solution is completely incorrect or irrelevant. * **partial:** The evaluator concluded that the solution is partially correct but has significant errors or omissions. * **almost:** The evaluator concluded that the solution is almost correct but contains minor errors or inaccuracies. * **correct:** The evaluator concluded that the solution is fully correct and complete. 25 Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning * **not_found:** The evaluation response does not clearly contain one of the four explicit scores listed above. * **Extraction:** Determine the provided score from the response and extract the category (correct, partial, almost, or incorrect). the text, the output must be not_found."

James and Peter play game on this table. Peter selects 3000 cells, under the rule that he must choose one from each row except the first and last rows (i.e., the 1st and 3002th row), and there must be at most one selected cell in each column. James knows this rule too, but he doesnt know which cells Peter selected. The goal of James is to move the stone to the last row, avoiding the cells selected by Peter. The stone can only move to adjacent cells on the table. If the stone enters cell selected by Peter, James receives penalty of 1 point, and the stone returns to its initial position (i.e., the leftmost cell). Find the smallest positive integer 𝑛 such that there exists method for James to achieve his goal before receiving penalty of 𝑛 points. gcd(𝑎𝑛 + 𝑏, 𝑏𝑛 + 𝑎) = 𝑔 holds for all integers 𝑛 𝑁.

Initially, Turbo does not know where any of the monsters are, but he knows that there is exactly one monster in each row except the first row and the last row, and that each column contains at most one monster. Turbo makes series of attempts to go from the first row to the last row. On each attempt, he chooses to start on any cell in the first row, then repeatedly moves to an adjacent cell sharing common side. (He is allowed to return to previously visited cell.) If he reaches cell with monster, his attempt ends and he is transported back to the first row to start new attempt. The monsters do not move, and Turbo remembers whether or not each cell he has visited contains monster. If he reaches any cell in the last row, his attempt ends and the game is over. Determine the minimum value of 𝑛 for which Turbo has strategy that guarantees reaching the last row on the 𝑛-th attempt or earlier, regardless of the locations of the monsters.

PB-Basic-005: Let 𝑃 be polynomial with real coefficients whose leading coefficient is 1. Suppose that for all nonzero real numbers 𝑥, we have 𝑃(𝑥) + 𝑃(1/𝑥) = 𝑃 (𝑥+1/𝑥 )+𝑃 (𝑥1/𝑥 ) . Determine all possibilities for 𝑃. 2 First, let us restate the problem clearly: We want to find all strictly increasing functions 𝑔 : ℝ ℝ such that: 1) 𝑔 is surjective, 2) 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥, for all 𝑥 ℝ. 1. Guess and check for linearity common approach for such functional equations is to hypothesize that might be linear (i.e., of the form 𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏). Let us try this: Assume 𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏, where 𝑎, 𝑏 ℝ. Compute 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)): 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏) = 𝑎(𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏) + 𝑏 = 𝑎2𝑥 + 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏. According to the functional equation, we need: 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥. Hence, 𝑎2𝑥 + 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏 = (𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏) + 20𝑥 = 𝑎𝑥 + 20𝑥 + 𝑏. Matching coefficients: Coefficient of x: 𝑎2 = 𝑎 + 20. Constant term: 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏 = 𝑏. From the constant term 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏 = 𝑏, we can factor out 𝑏: 𝑏(𝑎 + 1) = 𝑏 either 𝑏 = 0 or 𝑎 + 1 = 1. If 𝑎 + 1 = 1, then 𝑎 = 0, but that would force 𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑏, constant function, which cannot be strictly increasing nor surjective over all ℝ. Hence, that is not valid solution. Therefore, we must have = 0. Now the equation 𝑎2 = 𝑎 + 20 remains. Rewrite it as 𝑎2 𝑎 20 = 0. Factor or use the quadratic formula: (𝑎 5)(𝑎 + 4) = 0. This gives 𝑎 = 5 or 𝑎 = 4. 2. Strictly increasing and surjective requirement Since must be strictly increasing: If = -4, then would be strictly decreasing, which is not allowed. Hence must be positive, namely = 5. So the only candidate under our linear assumption is 𝑔(𝑥) = 5𝑥. Check surjectivity: The map 𝑥 5𝑥 is surjective, since for any 𝑦 ℝ, we can choose 𝑥 = 𝑦/5 to get 5𝑥 = 𝑦. It is also strictly increasing because 5 > 0. 3. Verification in the original equation Finally, verify 𝑔(𝑥) = 5𝑥 satisfies 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥: 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(5𝑥) = 5(5𝑥) = 25𝑥. 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥 = 5𝑥 + 20𝑥 = 25𝑥. These match, so 𝑔(𝑥) = 5𝑥 indeed satisfies both the functional equation and the given conditions. Conclusion Therefore, the only strictly increasing surjective function 𝑔 : ℝ ℝ satisfying 𝑔(𝑔(𝑥)) = 𝑔(𝑥) + 20𝑥 is 𝑔(𝑥) = 5𝑥. We consider polynomials of degree 2 and 4. For degree 2, we found 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥2 is solution. For degree 4, we found 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥4 + 𝑏𝑥2 + 𝑐𝑥 + 6. We found 𝑐 = 0. So 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥4 + 𝑏𝑥2 + 6 is solution for any real number 𝑏. We verified that 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥2 and 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥4 + 𝑏𝑥2 + 6 satisfy the given condition. We showed that polynomials of odd degree are not solutions, and polynomials of degree 0 and 1 are not solutions. We need to show that there are no other solutions. Assume degree of 𝑃 is 𝑛. If 𝑛 is odd, we showed no solution. So 𝑛 must be even. Let 𝑛 = 2𝑘. We have shown that for 𝑛 = 2, 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥2 and for 𝑛 = 4, 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥4 + 𝑏𝑥2 + 6. Final Answer: The final answer is 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥2 or 𝑃(𝑥) = 𝑥4 + 𝑏𝑥2 + 6 for some real number 𝑏.

Towards Robust Mathematical Reasoning Problem Model Solution and Grade PB-Basic 002: Show that 𝑥2 + 𝑦2 + 𝑧2 + 𝑡2 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡 for any positive real numbers 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧, 𝑡 that satisfy 2(𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 + 𝑡) 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡. Model Solution: Of course. This is great problem that elegantly combines given condition with target inequality. The key is to use the given condition to constrain the value of the product 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡. Here is the step-by-step proof. **Step 1: Use the given condition and the AM-GM inequality to find bound for the product 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡.** We are given two pieces of information for positive real numbers 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧, 𝑡: 1. The condition: 2(𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 + 𝑡) 𝑥 𝑦𝑧𝑡 2.

Note that reflecting the line 𝐶 𝐻 about 𝐴𝐶 gives the line 𝐶 𝐻𝑎, hence 𝐸1 lies on 𝐶 𝐻𝑎; similarly 𝐸2 lies on 𝐶 𝐻𝑏. Key lemma (fixed tangent direction): Let 𝑙 = 𝐴𝐶, 𝑟1 = 𝐶 𝐻𝑎, 𝑟2 = 𝐶 𝐻𝑏. For any circle 𝜔 through 𝐶 intersecting 𝑙, 𝑟1, 𝑟2 again at 𝑋, 𝑃, 𝑄 respectively, the angle between the tangent to 𝜔 at 𝑋 and 𝑋𝐶 is constant (independent of the chosen 𝑃 𝑟1 and 𝑄 𝑟2). Indeed, in the cyclic quadrilateral 𝑋 𝑃𝐶𝑄 we have: 𝑋𝐶𝑃 = (𝑙, 𝑟1) and 𝑋𝐶𝑄 = (𝑙, 𝑟2), both constants; 𝑋 𝑃𝐶 = 𝑋 𝑄𝐶 (equal angles subtending chord 𝑋𝐶); hence 2𝑋 𝑃𝐶 + 𝑋𝐶𝑃 + 𝑋𝐶𝑄 = 180, so 𝑋 𝑃𝐶 = 90 ((𝑙, 𝑟1) + (𝑙, 𝑟2))/2 is constant; by the tangentchord theorem, this 𝑋 𝑃𝐶 equals the angle between the tangent at 𝑋 PB-Basic 027: Given an acute triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶, let 𝐷 and 𝐸 be the feet of the altitudes from 𝐵 to 𝐴𝐶 and 𝐶 to 𝐴𝐵, respectively. Let 𝐸1 and 𝐸2 be the reflections of 𝐸 with respect to 𝐴𝐶 and 𝐵𝐶, respectively. If 𝑋 (not equal to 𝐶) is an intersection point of the circumcircle of 𝐶𝐸1𝐸2 and 𝐴𝐶, and 𝑂 is the circumcenter of 𝐶𝐸1𝐸2, prove that 𝑋𝑂 is perpendicular to 𝐷𝐸. and 𝑋𝐶. (. . .) Human Grade: 6 out of 7 Autograder Verdict: (. . .) ### Assessment and Score Determination The solutions overall structure is elegant, but it hinges entirely on \"Key Lemma\" which is false and whose proof is invalid. The argument is fundamentally flawed. <points>0 out of 7</points> Table 12 Examples of failure cases of ProofAutoGrader."
