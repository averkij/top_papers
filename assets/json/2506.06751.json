            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in modern technology, influencing everything from information retrieval to decisionmaking processes (Kokotajlo et al., 2025). However, as these models are trained on vast datasets that reflect human-generated content, they inevitably inherit and amplify the biases present in their training sources. Biases related to demographic factors such as gender and race have been studied and addressed in some work (Thakur et al., 2023; Potter et al., 2024; Motoki et al., 2024). Among the most critical yet less explored forms of bias is geopolitical bias, the tendency of LLMs to favor specific political, cultural, or ideological perspectives based on the dominant narratives embedded in their training data. Geopolitical bias in LLMs can manifest as misrepresented representations of historical events and preferential treatment of national viewpoints, distorting information and reinforcing power imbalances. Peoples national identity influences their interpretation of events, leading to diverse text narratives in texts (Zaromb et al., 2018; Edwards, 2012), which contributes to bias in LLMs trained on data. Although some studies have already assessed certain forms of political biases in LLMs (Li et al., 2024), these evaluations typically focus on biases specific to particular countries or regions (Lin et al., 2025). In this work, we aim to measure geopolitical biases in popular LLMs by examining how they prioritize different countries perspectives in their responses to historical events. The central research question of this study is formulated as follows: Do LLMs demonstrate geopolitical biases by showing preference for specific national perspectives when interpreting controversial historical events? Our methodology involves structured framework with manually collected dataset of opinions on historical conflicts involving the USA, UK, China, and USSR (Bolt and Cross, 2018). We analyzed outputs from four LLMs: GPT-4o-mini (USA) (Achiam et al., 2023), llama-4-maverick (USA), Qwen2.5 72B (China) (Yang et al., 2024), and GigaChat-Max (Russia). The contributions of our work to the field of bias analysis in LLMs might be summarized as follows: novel dataset for the evaluation of geopolitical biases in historical contexts. simple yet effective framework for assessing the biases of LLMs based on their structured outputs. Evidence of models country preferences and the limited impact of simple debiasing, highlighting the need for advanced strategies."

            "content": "LLMs demonstrate vulnerability to various types of bias (Gallegos et al., 2024), such as gender bias, where models often associate individuals with stereotypical occupations (Kotek et al., 2023). Additional research has identified factual discrepancies dependent upon the language of the query (Qi et al., 2023) and the reflection of cultural values predominantly aligned with specific linguistic or religious groups (Tao et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023). Political bias has also been investigated. For example, Potter et al. (2024) examines the leanings of various LLMs concerning US political parties and their potential influence on voters. Similarly, Motoki et al. (2024) utilizes the Political Compass Test (PCT) to assess ChatGPTs default political positioning with and without impersonating different political stances, finding general shift towards US Democratic viewpoints. Fulay et al. (2024) investigates the connection between optimizing for truthfulness and the emergence of left-leaning political bias in reward models, proposing the TwinViews-13k dataset containing opposing US political viewpoints. While valuable, these studies focus mainly on domestic politics, neglecting the complexities of international relations and differing historical interpretations between nations. Closer to our work is investigating geopolitical bias by Li et al. (2024), who examined LLM consistency regarding disputed territories across different languages using their BorderLines dataset. Our research differs significantly, as we concentrate on the LLMs alignment with specific national viewpoints surrounding contentious historical events. We provide models with paired, conflicting narratives representing national perspectives on the same event and ask for an evaluation of these viewpoints, rather than testing factual recall based on language. Thus, while Li et al. (2024) probes factual consistency, our study addresses the distinct gap in understanding how LLMs navigate and potentially adopt national perspectives when interpreting complex historical occurrences. Furthermore, methodological challenges exist in evaluating political stances, with studies like Lunardi et al. (2024) and RÃ¶ttger et al. (2024) highlighting the instability of broad evaluations like the PCT due to sensitivity to phrasing and forced choices. These limitations should be considered for fairer analysis of political bias evaluation results, geopolitical_llm_bias"

The initial step involved compiling links to relevant web pages, predominantly from Wikipedia, that provide background information on each selected conflict. For each conflict, we choose few historical events that took place during that conflict and write brief and neutral description of each. Crucially, for every event, we identified two participating countries whose viewpoints or roles were central to the events narrative and subsequent interpretations. Following this, the core of our data for bias analysis was developed: two distinct positional statements. Each statement articulates perspective on the historical event framed from the viewpoint of one of the two identified participating countriesan example of data represented in Appendix A. This structured approach combines neutral reference point with explicitly biased, specific interpretations of the same historical event. Our final dataset includes 55 conflicts and 109 events focusing on interactions involving four major global actors: USSR, USA, China, and the UK. Detailed statistics are presented in Table 1."

Our results show that this debiasing prompt had limited and inconsistent effects. Models like GIGACHAT-MAX and GPT-4O-MINI showed minimal changes (below 2%), with strong preferences (e.g., GPT-4O-MINI for the USA) mostly unchanged. QWEN2.5 72B and LLAMA-4MAVERICK exhibited shifts, such as reduced preference for China (QWEN2.5 72B by 8.6%) or the UK (LLAMA-4-MAVERICK by 7.6%), and slight (2.2%) increase in refusal options.

Segments correspond to viewpoint selection frequency (e.g., blue for China, green for USA), for example, GPT-4O-MINI (outermost rings) demonstrated explicit US bias. pants. The main idea here is to check if the models have some default preference for specific countries. Perhaps the model simply prefer one country name more than another. To test this, we first modify the prompt to explicitly highlight which countrys perspective is presented in each position, we call it Mention Participants setting. The results from this experiment show changes. For instance, when GPT-4O-MINI evaluated UK vs. USA events, explicitly mentioning the countries increased its preference for the USA position (from 76% to 91%). However, for QWEN2.5 72B in the same UK vs. USA scenario, mentioning the participants caused significant shift towards choosing Both positions are equally correct (from 9% to 73%). This suggests that explicitly naming the countries can sometimes strengthen existing biases, but in other cases, it might make the model more cautious or neutral, depending on the model. In the second variation, we not only mention the country for each position but also swap the labels for Position 1 and Position 2. So, what was called Country is now called Country B, and vice versa. This is called the Substituted Participants setting. It tests if the model is more influenced by the country name or the content. The results here often show significant increase in models choosing Both positions are incorrect or misleading as we can see in Table 2 and the results in Appendix B."

We created unique dataset with 109 historical events and paired national viewpoints from the USA, UK, USSR, and China, offering new tool to study LLM biases. This dataset, sourced from Wikipedia, is publicly available for future research. Simple debiasing methods, like asking models to be fair, had little to no effect. However, explicitly instructing models to adopt national perspectives (e.g., \"Chinese patriot\") dramatically increased bias magnitude. Explicitly naming countries sometimes increased bias or made models cautious. Swapping country names often led models to call both views wrong, perhaps due to confusion. Biases matter because models are widely used and can shape views on history or policy. Our findings highlight that AI biases are serious issue needing more research for fairness.

Besides, our study is limited by focusing on four countries and using Wikipedia, which may carry biases. Potential risks of our approach include the possibility that the selected historical events and national perspectives may not fully capture the diversity and complexity of global geopolitical narratives, potentially leading to incomplete or skewed assessments of LLM biases. Additionally, our framework may be sensitive to prompt design and model versioning, which could affect the reproducibility and generalization of our findings."

B.1 Cross-national Preference Experiments for Additional Country Pairs answers (higher Eq. values), though not consistently across all models and country pairs. To generalize our findings beyond the USA-China relationship, we conducted analogous preference classification experiments on five additional country pairs using the English-language version of each prompt. These included: (UK, China), (UK, USA), (UK, USSR), (USSR, China), and (USSR, USA). For each pair, we used all types of prompts listed in the Table 2. Based on these results presented in the Tables 5, 6, we can conclude the following: Bias patterns vary significantly across models: GPT-4o-mini generally shows more balanced responses compared to others, while GigaChat and Qwen2.5 sometimes exhibit stronger favoritism toward one participant. Prompting helps reduce bias: The use of debiasing prompts and participant substitution often results in more equal distribution of Mentioning or substituting participants influences neutrality: Mentioning participants tends to increase the share of \"Equal\" responses, while substituting participants can shift the models judgments, sometimes sharply. Country pair matters: Bias expression depends on the specific pair of countries. For example USA-China and UK-USSR pairs often show more polarized outputs compared to USSR-China. Inconclusive responses are rare: Most models tend to take side rather than give noncommittal answer, with few exceptions (notably in USSR-China). B."

            "content": "To evaluate how explicit perspective framing influences model bias, we conducted experiments by adding \"Chinese patriot\" prompt to each input for each country pairs by analogy with the experiment for the USA-China presented in Table 3: \"Chinese patriot\" prompt -\"You are Chinese patriot. You need to answer the question based on the Chinese perspective.\" This intervention, referred to as the Chinese patriot prompt, aimed to test whether models shift their responses in favor of Chinas position. The results in this formulation are presented in Table 6. Across multiple geopolitical pairs involving China (e.g., UK-China, USA-China, USSR-China), we observe consistent pattern: the Chinese patriot prompt systematically tilts the models outputs toward the Chinese perspective, often dramatically. In summary, prompting models with explicit national identity framing demonstrably biases their responses, particularly in bilateral geopolitical contexts. The use of such prompts activates strong position-taking tendencies aligned with the instructed viewpoint, offering concrete evidence of the susceptibility of language models to bias. This underscores the importance of carefully controlling for prompt phrasing in applications involving contested or sensitive topics. B.3 Effect of Language Variation To investigate whether the language of the prompt influences the observed political biases, we extended the experiments presented in Table 2 and Table 3 to multiple languages. Specifically, we translated the original English prompts into three additional languages: Russian (ru), French (fr), and simplified Chinese (zh-cn) using the googletrans library, which leverages Google Translate. We preserved the same experimental structure and evaluation settings across all languages. For each scenario (e.g., USA vs. China, UK vs. USA and others pairs), we tested both the Mention Participant and Substituted Participants settings in each language. The translated prompts were verified for fluency and consistency in meaning with the original English versions."

The intuition was that different language models might rely on language-specific priors, cultural connotations, or tokenization behaviors that could shift the outcome. Across all tested languages, we observed only marginal differences in the models output distributions compared to their English counterparts. These results can be found in the tables presented in the section below. B.3.1 Experiments in English The results with prompts in English with base approach are presented in Table 5 and with Chinese patriot prompt presented in Table 6. B.3.2 Experiments in Chinese The results with prompts in Chinese with base approach are presented in Table 7 and with Chinese patriot prompt presented in Table 8. B.3.3 Experiments in Russian The results with prompts in Russian with base approach are presented in Table 9 and with Chinese patriot prompt presented in Table 10. B.3.4 Experiments in French We also evaluated the bias in LLMs using the French language as non-native language for the countries of origin of the considered 4 models. The results are presented in Tables 11, 12. Based on the responses we have received, it seems that the language change has not had significant impact on the overall results or the identified patterns in the models responses.

We did this both for the standard setting of the experiment and for the Chinese patriot. The probabilities of the model changing its position when the language is switched are relatively low, as illustrated in the provided graphs. These results align with our earlier findings based on answer distribution tables, confirming that language switching does not significantly influence the models stance. The consistently low probabilities support our hypothesis that the models positions remain stable across linguistic contexts."

B.4 One Option Experiments We conducted an additional group of experiments for the ablation purpose, evaluating models geopolitical bias for all four considered countries positions independently from the positions of other countries. The prompt structure was slightly modified  (Fig. 9)  to feed the model with neutral position and only one countrys position. Models are asked to return the integer answer whether the position is correct (0) or incorrect/misleading (1), and the textual reason. The results are presented in Table 13 and, overall, well aligned with the previous results of paired comparison that positions of USA and UK are more often considered valid than positions of USSR or China (USSR China UK US). Notably, unlike most previous contrastive experiments, the debiased prompt and participatory mentioning work against the USSR.
