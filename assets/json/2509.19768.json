Figure 1: Summary of the performancecost trade-off across different VLMs on historical documents, measured on the full CHURRO-DS test set. CHURRO outperforms the 3B-parameter Qwen 2.5 VL by 21.3%. It also outperforms the second-best model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) by 4.1% while being 15.5 times more cost-effective. Costs for closed models are measured with the 50% batching discount offered by providers. The costs of open-weight models are estimated following Poznanski et al. (2025). languages, including historical variants of modern languages and dead languages, alongside evolving writing conventions, handwriting techniques, spelling, and typefaces, requires specialized expertise to study these materials. Moreover, document degradation caused by environmental factors over time further complicates text extraction (Sulaiman et al., 2019). Historical documents frequently contain features such as marginalia (Cheng et al., 2024), rubrication (Whetter, 2017), and illumination (Wyatt and Tymms, 1861), which are rarely encountered in modern texts. In addition, the wide variety of fonts used in printed documents and the lack of consistent orthographic standards (e.g., multiple spellings of the same word within single document) pose further challenges (Drobac et al., 2017). Handwritten text recognition (HTR) (AlKendi et al., 2024) is even more challenging due to the vast diversity of handwriting styles and calligraphic traditions (Blair, 2020), even within the same language. Historical scribes frequently abbreviated words to expedite writing, resulting in thousands of unique abbreviations (Candido and Aluísio, 2009), especially in pre-modern documents (Guéville and Wrisley, 2022; Rogos-Hebda, 2025). To improve accessibility, many efforts have been undertaken over the past two decades to digitize historical materials by scanning and converting them into machine-readable text (Oberbichler et al., 2022). The current state-of-the-art approach involves training collection-specific models using fine-grained (paragraph-level or line-level) annotated data (Reul et al., 2019). Various academic competitions (e.g., RASM (Clausner et al., 2018), REID (Clausner et al., 2017, 2019a)) have been organized to advance these efforts. Several platforms such as Transkribus (Kahle et al., 2017) and eScriptorium (Kiessling et al., 2019), provide tools for annotation and model training. However, reliance on annotated training data remains significant bottleneck. The recent advent of vision-language models (VLMs) (Liu et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Gemini Team Google, 2023; OpenAI et al., 2023) with strong zero-shot vision capabilities holds promise for addressing these challenges. OCR-related benchmarks such as DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2021), CharXiv (Wang et al., 2024b), CC-OCR (Yang et al., 2024b), OmniDocBench (Ouyang et al., 2024), and OCRBench (Liu et al., 2024b; Fu et al., 2025) have become standard among VLM developers. However, these benchmarks primarily target modern documents. We introduce CHURRO-DS, large-scale page-level dataset for OCR and HTR on historical corpora. CHURRO-DS is the most diverse historical dataset to date, created by unifying and cleaning over 150 existing datasets. It contains 99,491 documents from 46 language clusters, 29 of which appear in the validation and test sets: Arabic, Bangla, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Sanskrit, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Vietnamese. The dataset also encompasses 14 scripts from European, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, and Indic script families. Documents include newspapers, books, handwritten diaries, government records, and more, spanning from the 3rd century BC to the 20th century and covering three writing directions. Each page includes an image paired with full-text annotation, making it suitable for both benchmarking and training VLMs. Figure 2 shows the breakdown of language clusters and several example pages from CHURRO-DS. We introduce CHURRO, low-cost openweight VLM that outperforms larger models by fine-tuning relatively small 3-billionparameter VLM on CHURRO-DS. The CHURRO VLM achieves 82.3% and 70.1% on the printed and handwritten subsets of CHURRO-DS, respectively, outperforming all open and commercial VLMs by at least 1.4% and 6.5%. This result highlights the effectiveness of specialized training on carefully curated historical documents. We benchmark wide range of VLMs and OCR systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing how well VLMs process images of historical documents. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement among state-of-the-art VLMs in the zero-shot setting. The best-performing commercial model achieves 80.9% and 63.6% normalized Levenshtein similarity on printed and handwritten documents, respectively, averaged over all languages in CHURRO-DS. The best open-weight VLMs we evaluated lag behind, achieving 72.7% and 54.5%, respectively."

            "content": "Most existing document benchmarks focus on modern documents and layouts. PubLayNet (Zhong et al., 2019) and DocBank (Li et al., 2020) automatically annotate PDF articles from PubMed Central and arXiv, respectively, for layout segmentation. The RVL-CDIP (Harley et al., 2015) and IIT-CDIP (Lewis et al., 2006) datasets are derived from industry documents for document classification and retrieval. CCpdf (Turski et al., 2023) and WordScape (Weber et al., 2023) leverage Common Crawl to extract and annotate multilingual, visually rich documents. Building on this foundation, recent benchmarks such as CC-OCR (Yang et al., 2024b) and OCRBench (Liu et al., 2024b; Fu et al., 2025) compile datasets for text recognition, visual question answering, and key information extraction across many domains into unified benchmarks, primarily to evaluate VLMs. However, these efforts typically (a) Printed (b) Handwritten Figure 2: Overview and examples from the two subsets of CHURRO-DS.

For example, the German cluster includes Modern German, Old High German, Middle High German, and Middle Low German. remain focused on short outputs, modern documents, and text in English or Chinese (Ying et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023b). Concurrently, research trends are shifting toward direct, page-level OCR rather than pipeline methods that rely on bounding-box detection. For instance, recent works introduce models capable of page-level OCR but report only limited evaluationseither on noisy, LLM-annotated data (Poznanski et al., 2025) or only in English and Chinese (Wang et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024a). Our proposed CHURRO-DS advances this direction by providing curated, human-annotated page-level transcriptions across many languages, with explicit page-level reading order."

These efforts bridge the gap between general-purpose VLMs and specialized models for document structure and layout understanding (Blecher et al., 2024). Proprietary LLMs have also incorporated vision capabilities, such as GPT4V (OpenAI et al., 2023) and Claude 3 (Anthropic, 2024).

            "content": "CHURRO-DS is comprehensive benchmark and training resource curated for recognizing printed and handwritten text in historical documents. We standardize diverse annotation formats into single text string per page in proper reading order. This transformation reduces the problem to pure image-to-text, enabling straightforward evaluation of vision-language models. Through an extensive survey of NLP, computer vision, and humanities literature from the past two decades, we identified 153 historical corpora containing document page images and their corresponding transcriptions. We also release the first publicly available historical OCR datasets for Persian and Turkish. CHURRO-DS reflects the practical challenges of processing historical scans: images often contain irregularities such as page creases, scanning artifacts, and extra margins (e.g., parts of scanning tables). Although all images are correctly oriented, slight misalignments are common. 3.1 Dataset Selection CHURRO-DS comprises two subsets: one for printed documents and one for handwritten documents. Figure 2 provides an overview of the languages included in each subset, along with illustrative examples. Appendix lists all included datasets. The selection criteria were: 1) Documents must originate prior to the mid-20th century. 2) Datasets must have licenses permitting research use. 3) Datasets must include human-annotated, goldstandard text covering entire pages. We exclude distantly supervised datasets, such as VieBookRead (Do et al., 2024). Many historical datasets provide annotations at the character, word, or line level (Belay et al., 2023; Romanello et al., 2021); we include these if their annotations can be combined to reconstruct complete page-level text. Many of these datasets were originally transcribed by humanities researchers and have not previously been used for OCR, because they lack bounding-box annotations typically required by OCR models. By adopting page-level task definition, we can leverage these previously untapped resources. Additionally, we create and include the first publicly available HTR dataset for Ottoman Turkish, transcribed by the authors."

            "title": "3.2 Dataset Curation",
            "content": "Each example in CHURRO-DS consists of (1) an image of document page, (2) page-level metadata indicating language and script, and (3) text string representing the page content. The metadata enables fine-grained analysis of evaluated models. Because the source datasets come from many different origins, they are transcribed in various formats and follow different conventions. To facilitate effective training, we carefully curate the datasets with the goal of producing an output text string that is (1) in the proper reading order of the page, (2) as accurate as possible, and (3) as faithful as possible to the image, practice known as diplomatic transcription (Romero et al., 2019). We achieve this through combination of automated (LLMbased) transformations and manual verification, as described below. Page-Level Metadata. Each image is annotated with metadata indicating language and script. Such information is not always available from the original datasets. Some datasets lack language annotations entirely, while others (e.g., Clausner et al. (2015); Papadopoulos et al. (2013); Romein et al. (2020); Maheshwari et al. (2022a); Katušˇcák et al. (2024)) span multiple languages without indicating which page corresponds to which language. We leverage ISO 639-3 (Agency, 2007), which contains 7,916 languages and historical variants, grouping them into language clusters based on macrolanguage classifications. For languages without macrolanguage categories (e.g., English or German), we use ISO reference codes for contemporary forms as umbrella categories for historical variants. We prompt VLM with descriptions and examples from each cluster to detect the language of each page. When available, we use dataset documentation to constrain possible language clusters. We then manually review subsets for accuracy."

Tables 3 and 4 list all language clusters, scripts, and script families in CHURRODS. Reading Order. We standardize various annotation formats (e.g., ALTO XML (Library of Congress, 2025), PAGE XML (Pletschacher and Antonacopoulos, 2010), JSON, plain text) into single text string per page in correct reading order. While ALTO and PAGE XML support explicit reading-order annotations, many datasets lack them. For datasets with consistent layouts (e.g., singleor double-column), we develop dataset-specific heuristics. For more complex layouts, we employ VLM to determine reading order and manually spot-check outputs. Manual checks indicate that more than 98% of reading orders are accurate. Accuracy. We identified annotation issues in sixteen datasets. For instance, Dolfing et al. (2020) omits text in top margins, and datasets from HalterPernet et al. (2021) and Najam and Faizullah (2024) contain frequent transcription errors. To address these problems, we use VLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro (Kavukcuoglu, 2025)) to suggest corrections based on image bounding boxes. Corrections are subsequently reviewed and validated by the authors. Faithfulness. Our dataset includes scholarly editions from diverse institutions, each following distinct transcription standards (David Glück, 2018). Some editions employ modernized transcriptions with standardized spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, while others adopt diplomatic transcriptions (Romero et al., 2019) to faithfully represent original documents. For CHURRO-DS, we standardize on diplomatic transcriptions, ensuring evaluated systems need only transcribe what they see, independent of dataset-specific guidelines. In datasets such as Quirós et al. (2018), which include both original and expanded forms of abbreviations and hyphens, we retain original transcriptions. We exclude significantly modernized datasets where faithful transcription is unrecoverable. To restore spacing, line breaks, and diacritics from images, we use VLM guided by image bounding boxes and transcribed text to perform minimal edits. Character-level edit distances between original and edited transcriptions remain below 5%. We manually verify samples from each dataset for accuracy. Finally, we normalize typographic elements such as fractions (e.g., converting 14, Unicode U+00BC, to 1/4) and ligatures (e.g., Unicode U+FB06 to st)."

We remove pages with fewer than 30 tokens (tokenized by Qwen 2.5 VL (Bai et al., 2025)). Duplicate pages arising from dataset errors or reuse across datasets are identified and removed using MinHash (Broder, 1997), eliminating approximately 15,000 near-duplicates. Large images are resized to fit within 2500 2500 pixel box, preserving aspect ratios. Appendix A.1 provides text and image size statistics. Dataset Splits. To facilitate efficient evaluation across diverse language clusters, we construct balanced development and test sets by randomly sampling 60 pages per language cluster per document type (printed and handwritten). These samples are evenly divided into validation and test sets, with the remaining documents forming the training set. Due to limited examples for some languages, only 29 of the 46 language clusters appear in the validation and test sets; the remaining 17 appear only in the training set. The resulting dataset contains 97,151 training samples and 1,170 samples each for validation and test sets. Note that training sizes vary substantially, with as few as 6 and 12 samples for printed Chinese and handwritten Portuguese, respectively.

We then investigate the impact of fine-tuning using the CHURRO-DS training set. 4.1 Experimental Setup CHURRO. We fine-tune VLM on CHURRODS to obtain CHURRO. We selected the 3-billionparameter Qwen 2.5 VL for its compact size, strong zero-shot OCR performance, and ability to handle high-resolution, variable-sized imagesall critical for processing diverse layouts. We fine-tuned this model on the training portion of CHURRO-DS. VLMs. We select the top proprietary VLMs from the LM Arena Vision Leaderboard (Chiang et al., 2024), excluding earlier versions of some models that were superseded by updated releases. The selected models are GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, and GPT-5 Nano (OpenAI, 2025a); GPT4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, and GPT-4.1 Nano (OpenAI et al., 2025); GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini (OpenAI et al., 2023); O1 (Jaech et al., 2024), O3, and O4 Mini (OpenAI, 2025b); Claude Sonnet 3.7 (Anthropic, 2024) and 4 (Anthropic, 2025b); Claude Opus 4.1 (Anthropic, 2025a); and Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro (Kavukcuoglu, 2025). We also evaluate several strong open-weight, instruction-tuned VLMs of varying sizes: Qwen 2.5 VL (3B and 72B)(Bai et al., 2025); Gemma 3 27B(Gemma Team et al., 2024); MiMo VL (8B)(Xiaomi, 2025); Nemotron Nano VL (8B)(NVIDIA, 2025); InternVL 3.5 (30B)(Wang et al., 2025); (4B)(Yang et al., 2025); and Phi 4 Multimodal (5B) (Microsoft et al., 2025); and VLMs specifically tuned for page-level OCR: NuMarkdown (8B)(Numind, 2025), olmOCR (8B)(Poznanski et al., 2025), RolmOCR (8B)(AI, 2025), and Nanonets OCR (3B)(Mandal et al., 2025). We exclude models such as DeepSeekVL2 (Wu et al., 2024), whose supported context length is insufficient for the long texts in CHURRODS. All models are evaluated using the same prompt in Table 6. OCR Systems. We also benchmark several specialized OCR systems: Azure OCR (Microsoft, 2024), which supports handwritten text recognition in five languages and printed text recognition in over 100 languages; and Mistral OCR (Mistral AI, 2025), multilingual OCR engine optimized for long-form, dense documents. Unlike VLMs, which directly generate complete text from images, Azure OCR is pipeline model: it first detects text bounding boxes, performs OCR within these boxes, and then determines the correct reading order. Recognizing the difficulty VLMs face with long inputs, we also evaluate hybrid system that combines Azure OCR with VLM. In this approach, Azure OCR identifies bounding boxes and their reading order, after which VLM processes each bounding box individually. This division simplifies the VLMs task by providing smaller image inputs and requiring shorter textual outputs. We further report the performance of an oracle model that selects, for each example, the highest score among all models. This establishes an upper bound for ensembling methods that combine outputs from multiple systems."

            "content": "To enable direct comparison across fundamentally different approaches, we follow Blecher et al. (2024) and evaluate each systems final textual output against the gold annotations. Specifically, we compute the character-level Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1965), which measures the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into another. We normalize this distance by the length of the longer string and convert it to similarity by subtracting it from 1, yielding score in [0, 1]. This metric closely aligns with the Character Recognition Rate (1 minus Character Error Rate) commonly used in OCR studies (Neudecker et al., 2021; Karpinski et al., 2018; Liebl and Burghardt, 2020), but is bounded within [0, 1], enabling comparison across varying text lengths. We refer to this metric as normalized Levenshtein similarity. We compute the metric for each example and average the scores separately for printed and handwritten document types. For fairness, we apply the same normalization procedures (described in Section 3.2) to all model predictions. For texts in Arabic script, we perform additional normalization of diacritics and hamza using the PyArabic toolkit (Zerrouki, 2010). 4.3 Evaluation Results on Printed Documents Table 1 presents results for the printed subset of CHURRO attains the CHURRO-DS test set. the highest average performance among all systems (82.3%). Fine-tuning improves Qwen 2.5 VL (3B) across all languages by an average of 14.5%, with the largest gains for Japanese (37.0%), Finnish (32.9%), and Swedish (22.9%). Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, the much smaller CHURRO performs better on 12 of 18 languages (with the largest gaps in Romanian, Japanese, and Finnish) and matches it on Czech. Low performance on Chinese print is attributable to the CHURRO-DS training set containing only 6 examples, underscoring the importance of training data size. Among proprietary VLMs, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest zero-shot performance (80.9%), with other proprietary models performing between 7.2% and 42.2% worse. Among open-weight VLMs, OCR-specialized models perform best: NuMarkdown, olmOCR, and Nanonets OCR reach 72.7%, 69.8%, and 69.7%, respectively. Among OCR systems, Azure OCR achieves the best average performance (71.9%), falling 10.4% short of CHURRO. The hybrid model, combining Azure OCR with Gemini 2.5 Pro, averages 52.6% and trails at least one of its components in every language. Relative to Azure OCR alone, the hybrid system improves notably for Bengali and Romanian. We do not observe clear correlation between model size and performance within model families. For example, the 3B-parameter Qwen 2.5 VL outperforms the 72B-parameter variant from the same family, mirroring trends with Mini models in the GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 families. Overall, historical Chinese presents the greatest challenge; even the oracle ensemble achieves only 14.4%. This subset includes many two-page newspaper images with vertical text, non-rectangular article boundaries, and interspersed Latin characters."

Columns represent language clusters arranged alphabetically from left to right: Bangla, Bulgarian, Czech, German, English, Finnish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Latin, Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Sanskrit, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Chinese, and the average across all language clusters. Within each system category, models are sorted by average similarity (highest to lowest). for Greek (62.6%), Japanese (54.7%), Turkish (42.3%), Hebrew (42.1%), and Persian (36.8%). Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, the fine-tuned model performs better on 18 of 21 languages, trailing only on Arabic, Persian, and Norwegian. Among proprietary models, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest average similarity (63.6%). Notably, the performance gap between Gemini models and other proprietary VLMs is considerably larger for handwritten documents than for printed ones. Among open-weight VLMs, Qwen 2.5 VL (72B) leads with an average performance of 54.5%. Smaller, specialized OCR VLMsNuMarkdown, RolmOCR, and Nanonets OCRfollow with 51.2%, 49.0%, and 43.2%, respectively. bining Azure OCR with Gemini 2.5 Pro does not outperform its individual components. All models struggle particularly with Sanskrit, Khmer, and Hebrew; even the oracle ensemble achieves only 26.1%, 32.9%, and 59.1% on these languages, respectively. Greek and Turkish are also challenging for all zero-shot models we evaluated. Across both handwritten and printed subsets, multiple VLMs outperform OCR systems, underscoring the promise of VLMs for page-level OCR over pipeline methods."

Columns represent language clusters arranged alphabetically from left to right: Arabic, Catalan, German, Greek, English, Persian, French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Latin, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Chinese, and the average across all language clusters. Within each system category, models are sorted by average similarity (highest to lowest). ing: many CHURRO-DS pages have two or more columns, which some models mishandle. Readingorder errors are also more frequent in East Asian scripts, where the zero-shot model often fails to recognize top-to-bottom writing direction, as illustrated in Figure 6. CHURRO performs substantially better in this regard. Major Hallucinations. Thirty-six percent of the 50 predictions from the zero-shot Qwen 2.5 VL (3B) exhibit major hallucinations. These arise when model cannot reliably recognize the text and instead generates content that seems contextually plausible. Figure 14 shows an 18th-century Dutch letter where the model correctly identifies the document as letter but, unable to transcribe its content, produces text such as Dit is een brief (This is letter.). None of the predictions from CHURRO exhibit hallucinations. Errors in Gold Annotations. We found that 2 of the 50 examples contain gold-standard text that omits parts of the page. These omissions stem from annotation errors in the original datasets that persisted through our cleaning process. For example, the transcription in Figure 13 begins halfway through the left column. Other Minor Errors. We observe recurring minor errors across languages and periods. Models often confuse visually similar characters, such as transcribing for ø. These errors frequently occur in proper names. In Figure 17, the model renders Suso as Süss and Birgittiner as Bisittiner. Scan quality can also impact accuracy, as in Figure 14, where letter bound in volume leads to many character errors near the spine due to page curvature."

            "content": "In this paper, we introduced CHURRO, compact vision-language model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5 VL for historical text recognition. To support its training and evaluation, we curated CHURRO-DS, the largest and most diverse human-annotated text recognition dataset historical text recognition assembled to date. It unifies 155 corpora and nearly 100,000 pages spanning 22 centuries across 46 language clusters. Its diversity in languages, scripts, layouts, and formats makes it powerful resource for benchmarking and improving VLMs on historical texts. CHURRO-DS reveals the difficulty of the task: Gemini 2.5 Pro, the best-performing commercial VLM, achieves only 80.9% (printed) and 63.6% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity. Fine-tuned on CHURRO-DS, CHURRO achieves 82.3% and 70.1%, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro while being 15.5 times more cost-effective. These results represent improvements of 14.5% and 27.2% over the base model, highlighting the benefits of training on diverse historical corpus. Even imperfect model outputs can aid in digitization of documents as valuable first drafts, substantially reducing the effort required for scholarly correction. Such transcriptions make historical documents accessible to broader audience, including readers without specialized training in historical scripts."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Although CHURRO-DS is by far the most diverse resource for historical text recognition to date, it still underrepresents some languages. This imbalance reflects the scarcity of annotated historical datasets for many lower-resource languages. Notably, CHURRO-DS currently does not include any languages native to the African continent. Moreover, we only experimented with standard supervised fine-tuning. Future work should explore more advanced training methods in this setting."

For open-weight models, the IDs are taken from the HuggingFace hub. Throughout this paper, we refer to models by their total parameter counts to clarify the model sizes used. In cases where the official model ID differs (e.g., olmOCR), we use the total parameter count for consistency. B.2 Hyperparameters D.1 Reading Order-Related Errors in Vertical For all VLMs, we generate outputs with temperature of 0 (i.e., greedy decoding). All results are reported from single run. We set the maximum number of generated tokens to 20,000 for non-reasoning models and 40,000 for reasoning models to accommodate the additional reasoning tokens they generate. The value 20,000 is chosen based on Figure 3 to allow for the generation of all gold outputs. Reasoning parameters for reasoning models are included in Table 5. To create CHURRO, we fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 VL (3B) for 5 epochs on 32 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Using gradient accumulation and total effective batch size of 128, fine-tuning took approximately 25 hours. We used learning rate of 5 105 with cosine schedule. Overall, the computation for this paper, including fine-tuning and inference for all open-weight models, totaled about 6,000 GPU-hours on NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The tokenizer of Qwen 2.5 VL outputs variable number of tokens depending on the resolution of the input image. We resized all input images to maximum of 5,120 image patches, each of size 2828 pixels, for all fine-tuning experiments. This limits the total number of image and text tokens per example to under 25,000. B.3 Prompt Used for Zero-Shot Evaluation of"

In contrast, the zero-shot VLM fails to generate coherent transcription. Its output contains hallucinated markup symbols, fragmented character groupings, and widespread omissions or rearrangements. We attribute this to fundamental misalignment in layout assumptions: the model appears to interpret the document as modern layout with leftto-right, top-to-bottom reading order, rather than adhering to the traditional vertical, right-to-left format. This results in substantial degradation in both recognition accuracy and semantic structure. D.2 Recognition Challenges with Small"

            "content": "Figure 7 illustrates another challenging Classical Chinese document, characterized by mix of large title-like characters and densely packed columns of smaller body text. Like the previous example, this page follows vertical writing style with right-toleft column ordering. CHURRO transcribes the document with high accuracy. It preserves the reading order, successfully 3The English translation of the gold text is: In the eighth year of the Guimao cycle, the 10th year of the Song dynastys Chunxi reign, in the first month of spring, Wu Lüxin was appointed as general to lead campaign against Ailao. In the eleventh month, on the day of Renwu, solar eclipse occurred. In the ninth year of Jiachen, the 11th year of Chunxi, in the third month of spring, Champa sent tribute, including three items from Siam. Merchants from Qi and neighboring countries came to Yuntun Garrison to offer goods and request permission to trade. In the tenth month, the Meng people and others rebelled and fought among themselves. In the 10th year of Yisi, the 12th year of Chunxi, in the first month of spring, civil service examinations were held for scholars aged fifteen and above. Those proficient in poetry and classical texts were admitted to study at the imperial court; thirty candidates, including Pei Guokai and Deng Yan, were selected. The rest remained in school. In the seventh month of autumn, the King of Jiankang, Long Yi, was ordered to lead an expedition against the southern tribes, which were subsequently pacified. Figure 5: The effect of document length on normalized Levenshtein similarity. Here we show this effect for Gemini 2.5 Pro on the left and CHURRO on the right. Figure 6: Document example where the unusual reading order causes the zero-shot VLM to make major mistakes.3 detects both large and small characters, and handles rare historical forms, with only minor mismatches due to character encoding limitations. The zero-shot VLM, however, produces significantly incomplete transcription. It primarily detects larger, visually prominent characters such as titles and headers, while failing to recognize most of the smaller text. D.3 Reading Order in Western Languages The postcard in Figure 8 begins on the right side of the page, as is customary with postcards, and continues on the top left. CHURRO recognizes the text mostly correctly, but it does not accurately identify the reading order. This leads to prediction where the text order is reversed. D.4 Major Hallucinations from Stereotypes Some hallucinations due to misrecognition are based on stereotypes. In mid-19th-century English newspaper (Figure 9), the first column begins with report from India. The second column mentions the Queen traveling with the Princess Royal. The VLM is unable to decipher this text but captures enough wordsparticularly India and queen that it generates stereotypical passage about the Queen traveling to Calcutta with the Prince Royal. While it is statistically likely that those traveling to India from the UK in the 19th century went to Calcutta in large numbers and royal princes traveled more than royal princesses, text generation based on stereotypes results in factual mistakes. 4The English translation of the gold text is: To understand the harmony of Heaven and Earth is to discern signs of disorder. Each of the twelve earthly branches has its corresponding wind, and when the winds deviate from their natural rhythm, it is sign that order is failing. In the eighteenth year of Duke Xiang, the state of Chu attacked Zheng. The musician Shi Kuang first sang of the north wind, then of the south wind. The south wind lacked strength and coherence, and Shi Kuang declared that Chu would not succeed. Indeed, many Chu soldiers suffered from cold, confirming the signs of disrupted harmony. To address such disruptions and govern effectively, five roles are established to offer counsel and maintain order. These roles help interpret omens and seasonal patterns, ensuring that state affairs proceed in accordance with cosmic and political balance. Among them are three minor emissaries and two senior diviners, appointed to advise the king. The Inner Historian manages eight categories of royal decrees: granting rank, bestowing emoluments, dismissal, appointment, execution, birth, reward, and confiscation. The Grand Minister also conveys royal edicts and serves as secondary authority, helping oversee the laws and administrative affairs of the state. These officials work together to uphold governance, interpret laws, and plan state policy. D.5 Repetitive Degeneration Figure 10 shows an example from 19th-century German letter. The zero-shot VLM, upon gathering from the first line that this is letter, repeatedly predicts the same sentence over dozen times: Das Wetter ist hier sehr angenehm, which translates to The weather here is really nice. This is very standard opening line for letter. In the case of Figure 11, Latin manuscript, the zero-shot VLM predicts the word arsagriam and, without another word to follow, repeatedly generates the same word until it runs out of generation tokens. This manuscript remains difficult even for CHURRO. The fine-tuned VLM has several serious issues with recognizing the text and enters degeneration loop with another phrase. D.6 Errors Due to Historical Script Changes Sometimes, in historical languages, it is not only the spelling that differs from contemporary usage but also the script itself. This is the case for many contemporary languagesfor example, Azeri which has historically been written in the AraboPersian script and continues to be written with that script in Iran. However, during the Soviet era in Azerbaijan, Azeri was written with the Cyrillic alphabet, and today it is written in the Latin alphabet. In our dataset, this diversity of scripts is showcased by transitional Romanian, 19th-century alphabet that combined Cyrillic and Latin characters. Already subject of computational linguistics research (Frincu et al., 2023), transitional Romanian poses challenges for VLMs. Figure 12 shows 19th-century printed Romanian book. Without finetuning, the VLM does not recognize the Latin characters properly and defaults to Cyrillic spellings. These mistakes are drastically reduced in CHURRO. D.7 Strict Evaluation In Figure 10, words like beßer or ausgeschloßen (the character representing the German sharp S) are transcribed as besser and ausgeschlossen (with two modern characters), following orthographic changes in current standard German spelling. Such normalizations, while diverging from the text on paper, are not the same as actual recognition mistakes because they do not change the meaning of the text.

Your task is to extract the full text from given page. Only output the transcribed text between <answer> and </answer> tags. Follow these instructions: 1. You will be provided with scanned document page. 2. Perform transcription on the entirety of the page, converting all visible text into the following format. Include handwritten and print text, if any. Include tables, captions, headers, main text and all other visible text. 3. If you encounter any non-text elements, simply skip them without attempting to describe them. 4. Do not modernize or standardize the text. For example, if the transcription is using U+017F instead of or U+0430 instead of a, keep it that way. 5. When you come across text in languages other than English, transcribe it as accurately as possible without translation. 6. Output the OCR result in the following format: <answer> extracted text here </answer> Remember, your goal is to accurately transcribe the text from the scanned page as much as possible. Process the entire page, even if it contains large amount of text, and provide clear, well-formatted output. Pay attention to the appropriate reading order and layout of the text. Table 6: The prompt used for all zero-shot experiments. U+017F is the Unicode for long S, used in 18th and early 19th century English. U+0430 is the Unicode for cyrillic small letter a. We added these characters to the prompt after we noticed most VLMs try to normalize the text to modern English characters.

The e-NDP project : collaborative digital edition of the Chapter registers of Notre-Dame of Paris (Claustre et al., 2023) Description: According to our estimates no fewer than 18 main hands were involved in the writing of the registers during the medieval period. More than 98% of the content of the registers was written in Latin, the rest in French. The exact percentage is hard to estimate because the vernacular language is often used in formulae, notes and comments. It is rare to find entire pages or blocks written in French. Script family : The registers were written using Cursive script (ca. late XIIIe - XVIe). Documental typology : The volumes containing the chapter conclusions were conceived to serve as memorial records, but above all as documents for regular use and consultation in the daily practice of administration and management. In diplomatics the notion of \"documentary manuscripts\" is used to describe this kind of sources also by opposition to books and litterary or normative manuscripts.

His contribution to the field of grammar consists mainly of treatise called De uerbo, addressed to his diligentissimum discipulorum Craterus.The ars elaborates on the criteria for the classification of the conjugation of verbs, in short, if the genitive of dico is dicas or dicis. Itself rather arid development of principles that do not escape the general rule, nevertheless thanks to De uerbo 141 citations of classical authors have been passed down to us -some passages being otherwise lost-, mostly early Augustan poets. Adding to this, exhaustive lists of examples of verbs and derived nouns make an integral part of the treatise, that have been recycled from posterior Grammatici. De uerbo was last edited at the end of the 19th century by Heinrich Keil in his fifth (out of seven) tome of the Grammatici Latini, alongside an enormous corpus of artes dating from the 4th to the 7th century. This monumental edition lacks methodological rigor and exhaustive paleographical research, is, for the most part, outdated, leaving substantial amount of grammatical works in need of critical editions, including Eutychès own contribution. The manuscript tradition of the work, as reported by the excellent work of Colette Jeudy, is rather modest, as it is comprised of 32 manuscripts transmitting partially on entirely the text, and span from the end of the 8th to the 11th century AD. De uerbo enjoyed fulgurant posterity, that inspired two medieval scholars, namely Sedulius Scottus and Remigius of Auxerre to make commentary rendition out of it, attesting to its importance in the educational milieu. The typology of the manuscripts comes with two interesting features that pose at the same time the biggest difficulty for perspective editors (and, as we suppose, for Keil). Firstly, as many other works on grammar, actively used in the \"medieval classroom\" for the teaching of Latin, lists of examples are incorporated in the narrative between bits of theory, forming columns or/and tabular boards, mise-en-page apt for the memorization of these exceptions. At first, this feature may not seem as big of deal, but thorough examination of these tables and of the posterior works that use them indicate that it yields important information for the understanding of the manuscript tradition (see especially Conduché 2019 \"La mise en page dEutychès\"). Secondly, several witnesses are richly annotated with multiple layers of interlinear and marginal notes, the progressive accumulation of which finds its climax in Remigius of Auxerres commentary. Gloses in grammatical manuscripts have only recently (better late than ever!) started to interest editors (see Monella/Rosselini for Priscian and Evina Steinovà for Isidore of Sevilles Etymologies)most of them making use of digital tools. And that is because typology as complex as that of grammatical glossed manuscripts cannot be easily handled and, better, be utilized for research purposes without the flexibility, absence of spatial constraints and ability of to handle of big and multilayered data that digital tools offer.

Two or more consonants can also be merged together by transforming into different shapes called low-consonant or subscript form which are placed below the main consonant. These variations of how Khmer letters are formed produce multiple levels (sometimes more than three) of characters. Moreover, some writers tend to exaggerate their writing by elongating the upper or lower part of character which makes it go far out of its main line, touch, or overlap with other characters from adjacent lines. In addition, the ambiguity of certain characters in Khmer alphabet is big challenge as well for character recognition problem. Some groups of characters can only be distinguishable by mere difference of small hole or short stroke. Some types of symbols contain multiple parts whose shapes are identical or very similar to other characters.
