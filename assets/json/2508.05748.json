            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Deep research agents represents new frontier in Artificial Intelligence (AI), where Large Language Models (LLMs) go beyond static prompts to plan multi-step tasks: issuing search queries, reading documents, browsing the web, and refining answers through iterative reasoning (OpenAI, 2025a; Google, 2024; Perplexity, 2025). Many open-source, text-only web agents for deep research (Li et al., 2025b;a; Wu et al., 2025a; Zheng et al., 2025) have demonstrated superhuman abilities to interact with intricate information environments, achieving remarkable performance on high-difficulty benchmarks such as BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025a) and Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025). However, most advances to date remain primarily text-centric, neglecting the rich visual information omnipresent in realworld scenarios. Many research-centric and everyday tasks such as interpreting scientific diagrams (Hu et al., 2024), analyzing graphics (Wang et al., 2024b), or navigating visually rich web interfaces (Hong et al., 2024), demand integrated vision-language reasoning (Dong et al., 2025). While proprietary agents have made strides in this area, multimodal deep research remains largely unexplored, with few agents tackling high-difficulty Vision-Language (VL) tasks (Xu & Peng, 2025; Hu et al., 2025). The key challenge lies that current multimodal deep research agents rely on rigid, template-driven pipelines limited to specific scenarios, lacking the flexible reasoning required for real research challenges. On the one hand, many existing VL Agents rely mainly on visual tools to perform image-based reasoning, such as optical character recognition (OCR), bounding box extraction, image cropping, visual annotation and so on (Zhao et al., 2025; Su et al., 2025a;b). While visual tools assist agents in handling perceptual tasks, they struggle to integrate visual reasoning with deep textual understanding and cross-modal inference, falling short in tackling high-difficulty tasks that require complex reasoning. As shown in Fig. 2, when faced with high-difficulty case from GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023), visual-only analysis fails to yield solution, highlighting that VL Agents remain confined to perception tasks. On the other hand, only use search tools restricts Search Agents to retrieval tasks and prevents them from solving complex real-world tasks (Wu et al., 2025b). Although retrieval-augmented reasoning can handle many knowledge-based questions, it often fails when answers are implicit, require structured interactions, or demand additional computation (Shen et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2025). For example, some problems require executing code to interpret charts, performing step-by-step calculations, or browsing dynamic webpages to extract up-to-date or structured content. As illustrated in Fig. 2, solving this case requires not only searching, but also tools to click through relevant links and browse the resulting webpage to gather necessary information. To address this gap, agents for VL deep research require not only strong reasoning abilities across both textual and visual information, but also effective use of multiple external tools. Thus, we introduce WebWatcher, VL web agent with deep research capability. In order to achieve strong reasoning abilities across both textual and visual information, it is essential to construct data that combine high-quality visual content with complex reasoning. However, most current visual question answering (VQA) data primarily focus on visual perception with single-step inference, lacking planning complexity and reasoning depth needed to support advanced agent capabilities (Chen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025c). Thus, we introduce pipeline to generate training data that benefits in-depth, multi-step reasoning and strategic planning, encouraging agents to synthesize information across both modalities. Importantly, we begin by harvesting real-world knowledge via random walks over diverse web sources to build high-difficulty question answering (QA) examples with unpredictable, multi-hop reasoning chains (Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025a), closely resembling the information-seeking and compositional nature of BrowseComp tasks (Wei et al., 2025b). To further raise the complexity, we mask key entities in questions, replacing specific terms with generic description, forcing models to infer relationships from context. Next, we convert this enriched QA pairs into multimodal VQA items using an adaptable QA-to-VQA pipeline compatible with most existing QA datasets, enabling substantial scaling of multimodal datasets. Finally, multi-stage filtering process ensures the quality and clarity of the 2 Figure 2: Comparison of VL reasoning agents. WebWatcher resolves the GAIA case that defeats either vision-only reasoning or search-based agents, demonstrating the strength of multi-tool integration and in-depth reasoning generalization. generated data. Moreover, to enable effective use of multiple external tools, first we implement the integration of multiple tools, including Web Image Search, Web Text Search, Webpage Visit, Code Interpreter and internal OCR. However, key challenge lies in obtaining high-quality reasoning trajectories. Firstly, recent reasoning agents generate traces that often tend to be long and templated, with limited diversity or adaptability across tasks (Rose et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2025). Secondly, coordinating multiple tools, each of which has distinct input-output formats and reasoning roles, makes trajectory construction even more complex. To address this, we develop fully automated pipeline that uses prompting to construct reasoning trajectories from action-observation sequences. Unlike hand-crafted CoT-style traces or template-based rationales, our trajectories are grounded in actual tool-use behavior and reflect procedural decision-making aligned with complex reasoning demands. We also combine LLM-based prompting with rule-based filtering to ensure high-quality. Then we finetune the agent model using synthesized high-quality trajectories that reflect deep reasoning across tools, and further optimize it via reinforcement learning algorithm, GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). Finally, we introduce challenging VQA benchmark BrowseComp-VL, which mirrors the complexity of BrowseComp, but extends it into the visual domain, emphasizing challenges that demand both perception and superhuman information-gathering abilities. Queries are constructed to be long, BrowseComp-style, and entity-obfuscated, requiring agents to perform cross-modal inference, thorough information-seeking, and high-level planning to resolve. Perception alone is not sufficient. Agents need to use external tools such as web search, image retrieval and webpage browsing to gather and integrate evidence. As shown in Fig.1, WebWatcher achieves strong performance on several high-difficulty benchmarks, including HLE, LiveVQA, BrowseComp-VL, and MMSearch. It consistently outperforms existing opensource multimodal research agents and proprietary systems on four reasoning benchmarks, and show competitive performance on the perception benchmark, SimpleVQA. 3 Figure 3: Domain Distribution for Level 1 and Level 2."

            "title": "2.1 Dataset Overview and Structure",
            "content": "Our dataset BrowseComp-VL is designed for advanced multi-modal reasoning agents operating in real-world web environments. Each example comprises factual image, an associated question requiring cross-modal reasoning, and auxiliary metadata about the underlying entities and relations. As shown in Fig.3, BrowseComp-VL is organized into 5 major domains comprising 17 fine-grained subfields, which is detailed in Appendix B. The major domains include Entertainment, Humanities, Technology, Natural Science and Other. Additionally, we define two difficulty levels to encourage spectrum of reasoning abilities: Level 1: Questions require multi-hop reasoning but still reference explicit entities. While the answers can be obtained through iterative retrieval steps, the reasoning process remains nontrivial due to the need for integrating information across multiple sources. Level 2: Questions are constructed with intentionally obscured or fuzzified entities and attributes. For example, concrete dates are replaced with vague periods, names are masked, and quantitative properties are fuzzed up. This design introduces substantial uncertainty, requiring the agent to plan, compare, and synthesize information rather than perform direct retrieval. Prompting LLMs to generate VQA questions directly from images is common practice, but it often yields shallow, single-hop queries that lack ambiguity, structured planning, and deeper reasoning. Moreover, most existing VQA datasets focus on perception and rarely combine rich textual information with knowledge-intensive, multi-step reasoning. To address this limitation, we first build diverse set of challenging textual QA pairs focused on multi-hop reasoning and knowledge-intensive questions. Then we transform these into VQA tasks by grounding them in relevant visual content. This pipeline yields high-quality multimodal data maintained both visual richness and textual reasoning complexity."

            "content": "2.2.1 Generate QA Level 1 Inspired by the CRAWL-QA from WebDancer (Wu et al., 2025a), we increase the depth and breadth of reasoning by collecting root URLs from authoritative and knowledge-rich sources such as arXiv, GitHub, and Wikipedia. To emulate human-like browsing behavior, we recursively traverse accessible hyperlinks within each root domain. GPT-4o is then used to synthesize question-answer pairs from the aggregated content. 4 Figure 4: Data generation pipelines. Level 2 Following WebSailor (Li et al., 2025a), we construct queries with fuzzed entities by replacing precise references with partial, ambiguous descriptions. Our approach emphasizes situations where answers cannot be retrieved through direct lookup, but instead require contextual reasoning and synthesis across modalities. We design two-stage generation framework consisting of: (1) Nodes Selecting: Given an initial Wikipedia page, we first prompt GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) to generate base QA pair grounded in the page content. The title of page serves as the root entity node Broot. Starting from Broot, we recursively expand hyperlink graph by traversing outgoing links to construct tree of depth and branching factor k, resulting in total of (kd+1 1)/(k 1) nodes in the entire traversal. In our implementation, we set = 3 and = 3 to ensure sufficient semantic coverage. To generate diverse reasoning paths, we sample multiple subgraphs from the entire tree. We randomly select subset of nodes and continue expansion until subgraph containing entities is formed. Each subgraph defines unique reasoning path from Broot to newly selected target entity B, forming knowledge graph encoding multi-hop relations. These subgraphs serve as the foundation for generating distinct QA pairs. (2) Query Generating: Based on the selected subgraph and the ground truth, we first prompt GPT-4o to generate standard form that explicitly references entities and relations along the reasoning path. Then, it is transformed into fuzzed version in which key references are replaced with partial, ambiguous, or qualitative descriptions. This design encourages diverse reasoning patterns, pushing models to infer answers via synthesis rather than surface matching. 2.2.2 QA-to-VQA Conversion Visual Context Construction for VQA To ensure effective visual grounding, we first filter out trivial or excessively ambiguous target entities B, such as those that denote temporal references or domain-external concepts, which lack sufficient visual grounding. For each retained entity ˆB, we retrieve set of web images I( ˆB) = ˆB via Google SerpApi (Google, 2025), where = 2 in our implementation. The resulting images I( ˆB) serve as the visual grounding to construct multimodal reasoning examples. Unlike synthetic or composited images prevalent in existing VQA benchmarks, our images are strictly authentic, thus minimizing noise and maximizing relevance for real-world tasks. 2 , . . . , ˆB 1 , ˆB 5 Entity Masking and Question Transformation To construct image-grounded VQA pairs from each textual QA instance (qt, a), we apply prompt-based rewriting using GPT-4o. Let qt denote the original text question containing clear mention of the target entity ˆB. We mask this mention with visual reference token rvis, such as demonstratives (this entity) or descriptive phrases (the object in the image), to yield transformed VQA query q. Simultaneously, we generate an image query string simg( ˆB) to guide filtering of I( ˆB). Each image ˆB I( ˆB) is then paired with (q, a) to form distinct VQA instance. Consequently, each textual QA pair produces multimodal examples, yielding total of Kn VQA items from original questions."

Second, GPT-4o is prompted to evaluate each image ˆB I( ˆB) with respect to both the original QA pair (qt, a) and the transformed VQA query (q, a). GPT-4o assesses contextual alignment, semantic fit, and the plausibility of visual reasoning. Instances receiving low relevance scores are filtered out. Examiner: For each retained image-query pair (simg( ˆB), I( ˆB)), GPT-4o is prompted to answer the synthesized query simg( ˆB) using only the visual content and associated captions of I( ˆB). Failure to answer accurately indicates weak retrieval or poorly formed image query, and such query are therefore filtered out. Additionally, to mitigate false negatives arising from missing world knowledge, the model is granted access to available image captions during validation."

            "content": "3.1.1 Multimodal Tools We equip WebWatcher with set of external tools, including: (1) Web Image Search powered by Google SerpApi (Google, 2025), for retrieving relevant image, corresponding caption and its webpage url to better understanding input image I; (2) Web Text Search, for open-domain information seeking, retrieving title and webpage url of query (Google, 2025); (3) Visit from Jina (Jina.ai, 2025), enabling navigation to specific URLs for summary of the webpages, tailored to the \"goal\" specified in the LLMs action; (4) Code Interpreter, supporting symbolic computation and numerical reasoning (Cheng et al., 2024). (5) OCR, an internal tool invoked via prompt and SFT data to extract text from the input image. Full implementation details are provided in Appendix D. 3.1.2 Automated Trajectory Annotation Given VQA instance (I, q, a) from BrowseComp-VL, we employ GPT-4o to automatically construct tool-use trajectories that simulate how human might explore and reason through problem by trying different tools step by step. Following ideas from ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), each trajectory τ consists of 6 multiple think-act-observe cycles. Concretely, at each iteration t, the language model takes as input the accumulated context history and generates: Thought: the agents intermediate reasoning or plan, enclosed in <think>...</think>; an Action: the tool invocation wrapped in <tool_call>...</tool_call> and the final answer enclosed in <answer>...</answer>; an Observation: the returned result from the environment, within <tool_response>...</ tool_response> tags. The action space includes discrete set of tool-use actions tl, allowing the agent to retrieve external information, navigate webpages, and perform computations, etc. Crucially, the Finish action signals task completion by returning final answer and terminating the reasoning episode. Formally, trajectory of length is denoted as τ = {(t0, o0), (t1, o1), . . . , (tL, oL)} , (1) where each action ti and each observation oi reflects the resulting environment feedback after tool execution. The trajectory serves as content-grounded demonstration of planning and tool selection. 3.1.3 Trajectory Filtering and Quality Assurance To ensure robust and instructive supervision, we apply three-stage trajectory selection: (1) Final Answer Matching We retain trajectory τ where the final answer matches the ground truth a, ensuring that the entire sequence of tool-use steps leads to correct and complete solution. (2) Step-by-Step Consistency Check We use GPT-4o to verify the logical consistency of each intermediate step in trajectory τ. Each pair (tl, ol) is reviewed to ensure the tool call and observation align with the context and reasoning goal. Trajectories with hallucinated content, contradictions, or unjustified tool calls are discarded. This avoids the common failure mode where correct answers are reached by lucky guessing rather than meaningful tool use. (3) Minimum Tool Usage Requirement To encourage multi-step reasoning rather than shortcutting, we remove τ with fewer than three tool calls. This ensures that training data reflects substantive, process-driven interactions rather than trivial or one-step completions."

            "content": "With SFT providing cold-start initialization, we employ Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Guo et al., 2025), ranking-based variant of PPO, to further refine decision-making and adapt to complex 7 tasks. Specifically, for the VQA query q, the current policy πθ generates group = {τ1, . . . , τK} of complete trajectories, each assigned scalar return Ri. The group-relative advantage is in Eq. 3: Arel(τ(i)) = R(i) 1 j= R(j), (3) which normalizes rewards within the group and eliminates the reliance on separate value function. The GRPO objective is defined as clipped surrogate loss: LGRPO(θ) = τ(i)G (cid:104) min (cid:16) ρ(i) Arel(τ(i)), clip (cid:16) ρ(i), 1 ϵ, 1 + ϵ (cid:17) Arel(τ(i)) (cid:17)(cid:105) β DKL (cid:0)πθπθold (cid:1) , (4) πθold where ρ(i) = πθ (τ(i)) (τ(i)) is the importance sampling ratio between the current and previous policy, Arel(τ(i)) is the group-relative advantage defined in Eq. 3, ϵ is the clipping threshold, and DKL denotes the KullbackLeibler divergence between successive policies. The coefficient β controls the strength of the KL penalty. This objective promotes stable updates while encouraging exploration of trajectories with higher relative return. Each trajectory τ is sequence of tool calls τ = {(t0, o0), (t1, o1), . . . , (tL, oL)}. The trajectory τ first receives binary format score rf {0, 1}, which is 1 if all tool calls conform to the schema. Then, an LLM grader provides semantic accuracy score ra [0, 1] by comparing the final answer with the ground truth. The total reward for τ is computed as: = rf + (1 w) ra, (5) where = 0.2 denotes the weight balancing rf and ra, encouraging the agent to generate well-structured tool calls while ultimately focusing on task completion. Since is assigned only once at the end of each episode, the group-relative ranking in Eq. 3 facilitates effective credit assignment without relying on per-step shaping. In our GRPO implementation, we collect rollouts in groups of = 16 trajectories, which provides sufficient diversity for computing meaningful relative advantages while maintaining computational efficiency during training."

Moreover, WebWatcher-32B demonstrates particularly significant gains in challenging domains such as Biology and Physics, underscoring the effectiveness and broad applicability of our agentic approach for solving real-world, open-domain, high-stakes exams. Results on Four Challenging Benchmarks. Results in Tab. 2 highlight the comparative advantages of WebWatcher across four challenging VQA benchmarks. While direct inference methods with strong MLLMs remain limited, and RAG workflows offer consistent improvement, especially on LiveVQA and SimpleVQA, our agentic system shows clear superiority. Among these, our proposed WebWatcher-32B stands out, delivering top-tier performance with 58.7% on LiveVQA, 55.3% on MMSearch, and highly competitive results on the other two datasets. Compared to both RAG-based and previous agentic baselines such as OmniSearch, WebWatcher achieves more stable and superior results, particularly on demanding, real-world visual search benchmarks like MMSearch. Furthermore, the BrowseComp-VL benchmark is purposely difficult, requiring multi-page web browsing plus fine-grained visual grounding, and most baselines stay below 20%, underscoring the benefit of our dynamic tool-use loop. Even on SimpleVQA, which mainly tests fine-grained visual perception and reasoning rather than external knowledge, WebWatcher attains leading score of 52.6%. This demonstrates that our approach not only excels at knowledge-intensive tasks but also exhibits robust visual reasoning capabilities, highlighting its broad applicability across diverse VQA scenarios."

The height of each bar denotes the fraction of total calls made to that tool within the corresponding benchmark. each account for about quarter of all calls, with the remaining interactions mostly involving Visit for navigating web pages. In contrast, BrowseComp-VL focuses much more on information seeking: when information retrieval becomes the main challenge, the agent concentrates 62% of its interactions on Web Text Search, while Web Image Search is used much less and Code Interpreter is almost never used. LiveVQA, SimpleVQA, MMSearch shift the focus back to visual content, and the policy adapts accordingly: Web Image Search jumps to around one-third or more of all calls, while Web Text Search and Visit serve as auxiliary tools for textual evidence and navigation. Across all suites, the heavier Code Interpreter is invoked only when genuine calculation is needed, confirming that the agent is cost and context aware. Altogether, the distribution of tool usage closely tracks the characteristic skills each benchmark demands, highlighting the models ability to flexibly choose the right tool chain rather than defaulting to single strategy. Cold Start for RL Training. SFT-based cold start is indispensable for our visionlanguage agent, because the tasks require robust multi-hop reasoning while continuously interacting with the environment. We verify this claim by running the same online RL algorithm under two different initializations: 1) Instruct: the model is warm-started only with public instruction-following data; 2) Cold-start: before RL, the model undergoes an extra SFT stage on high-quality trajectories that explicitly demonstrate tool usage and step-by-step visual reasoning. As shown in Fig. 6, under the Instruct start the agent stays near zero for many steps of tool-call format errors wipe out the reward and the strict Qwen-2.5-72B grader further suppresses partial answers. Cold-start SFT lifts the initial scores to 0.12 on HLE, 0.30 on BC-VL, and 0.45 on LiveVQA, but the subsequent GRPO trends differ: HLE and BC-VL oscillate heavily with no clear upward drift, whereas LiveVQA shows steady rise and keeps 0.060.18 margin over the Instruct baseline throughout. Injecting CoT chains from larger reasoner made the small model unstable, format violations, repetitions, and context overflow spiked, confirming that reasoning traces cannot replace an SFT cold start under our strict RL setting. Pass@k Analysis on HLE. Fig. 7 plots the Pass@k curve of WebWatcher on HLE for ranging from 1 to 32. Even with single attempt (k = 1) the agent attains 13.6% pass rate, already ahead of every direct-inference baseline and most retrieval-augmented systems. As increases, the curve rises steeply at first: three diverse roll-outs raise the score to 20.3%, relative improvement of roughly fifty percent, demonstrating that the agent can harvest substantial benefit from only handful of complementary 11 Score on HLE Benchmark Score on BC-VL Benchmark (average) Score on LiveVQA Benchmark Figure 6: Performance comparison using cold start in RL training on three benchmarks. trajectories, far more than one would obtain by merely turning up temperature on the backbone model. Improvement continues beyond = 8 but at slower pace; still, performance remains monotonically increasing, reaching 35.7% at = 16 and 41.9% at = 32. Thus, compared with single-shot inference, 32 trials almost quadruple the success rate and surpass reasoning models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and o4-mini. The smooth, jump-free shape of the curve indicates that our de-correlated sampling strategy successfully generates mutually informative trajectories rather than redundant variants, enlarging knowledge coverage and avoiding dependence on lucky outliers. Because marginal gains taper after about sixteen samples, practitioners may cap the budget at 816 roll-outs to secure 2 to 3 fold accuracy boost while containing compute costs. Overall, the Pass@k profile highlights the clear advantage of the agentic paradigm: by systematically exploring and refining reasoning paths, WebWatcher delivers robust, scalable improvements on one of the most challenging open-domain multimodal exams to date."

            "content": "Figure 7: Pass@k performance of WebWatcher on HLE Benchmark. Deep Research The notion of \"deep research\" agentssystems that autonomously search, read, reason, and synthesize knowledge from the open webhas evolved rapidly in the last two years. Proprietary solutions such as DeepResearch (OpenAI, 2025a), Gemini Deep Research (Google, 2024), now exhibit nearexpert performance across fact-finding, argumentative writing, and exploratory analysis, yet the secrecy of their model architectures and data curation pipelines inhibits rigorous ablation and reproducibility. Open-source initiatives have attempted to close this gap: WebDancer (Wu et al., 2025a) introduces curriculum-driven SFT over ReAct traces. WebThinker (Li et al., 2025b) then augments SFT with policygradient refinement and R1-Searcher (Song et al., 2025) leverages self-play to learn tree-structured exploration policies. WebSailor (Li et al., 2025a) focuses on uncertainty reduction which used structured task obfuscation, RFT cold-start, and the DUPO algorithm. Recently, WebShaper (Tao et al., 2025) proposes formalization-driven data-synthesis pipeline by introducing Knowledge Projections and an agentic Expander. Nevertheless, nearly all leading deep-research agents are still text-bound (Tang et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025). Integrating vision, layout, and cross-modal grounding is therefore not minor tweak but the necessary next leap, multimodality will fundamentally redefine what deep research can achieve. Multimodal VQA Benchmark Most existing VQA benchmarks primarily assess single-step perception or shallow retrieval, with limited support for integrated multimodal reasoning and planning (Chen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025c). Datasets such as OK-VQA and A-OKVQA typically emphasize static knowledge grounding and heuristic answer prediction without requiring complex reasoning. Recent efforts have 12 begun to expand the evaluation space. MMT-Bench offers large-scale coverage of planning-oriented tasks across multiple domains, yet its multiple-choice format restricts the assessment of procedural reasoning and rich textual outputs (Ying et al., 2024). MicroVQA and Open3DVQA explore domain-specific and spatial reasoning, but are constrained by limited scale, manual curation, or lack of complex planning structure (Burgess et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). Similarly, Dyn-VQA introduces adaptive query tasks but remains narrow in multimodal scope and size (Li et al., 2025c; Chen et al., 2025). While datasets such as MMMU and MMMU-Pro further surface performance limitations of current MLLMs on domainspecific and multi-image tasks, no existing benchmark comprehensively supports multi-step reasoning, cross-modal integration, large scale, and full automation with rigorous quality control (Yue et al., 2024a;b). To address these gaps, we introduce large-scale, automated VQA benchmark designed to advance planning-oriented, multi-hop, and context-rich multimodal reasoning. Our dataset enables scalable evaluation of MLLMs capabilities in goal-directed, flexible agent behavior, setting new standard for future research in this area."

To equip agents with robust tool-use capabilities, we further develop an automated trajectory generation pipeline grounded in action-observation traces, enabling high-quality supervision for cold start and GRPO. Finally, we enhance evaluation through test-time scaling strategy.

For SFT, we use batch size of 32, learning rate of 5e-6 with minimum of 1e-10, warmup plus cosine decay schedule, and weight decay of 0.1. For RL training, the rollout number in group is 8, the temperature is 1.0, top_p = 1.0, the batch size is 128, the mini batch size is 32, and the learning rate is 1e-6. D.4 Benchmarks We evaluate our method on five challenging benchmarks: BrowseComp-VL: We sample 100 instances from Level 1 and 200 instances from Level 2 to form the evaluation set. Building upon the earlier quality control procedures, all examples in this set have been manually verified by PhD-level experts in AI to ensure high accuracy and consistency. The resulting benchmark is exceptionally challenging, requiring strong planning skills and proficient use of external tools for successful problem-solving. HLE (Phan et al., 2025): HLE is challenging benchmark composed of 2,500 expert-written questions across diverse academic fields such as science, engineering, and the humanities. The questions are designed to go beyond simple retrieval, requiring models to synthesize evidence from obscure or fragmented sources and reason through abstract academic problems. We evaluate on subset of 330 multimodal questions to assess visual-textual reasoning capabilities. LiveVQA (Fu et al., 2025): LiveVQA evaluates models ability to answer questions grounded in up-to-date visual knowledge. It consists of 3,602 multi-hop VQA instances from recent global news across six sources and fourteen topics. We evaluate on 300-example subset. SimpleVQA (Cheng et al., 2025): SimpleVQA is factual VQA benchmark containing 2,025 examples in both English and Chinese. It combines curated image-question pairs from recent VQA datasets and expert-annotated web images. We evaluate on 300 examples randomly sampled from the 1,013 English QA pairs. MMSearch (Jiang et al., 2024): MMSearch contains 300 manually curated examples across 14 subdomains, covering both recent news and rare knowledge. Of these, 171 are paired with images. We use this visual subset for evaluation. D.5 Evaluation Prompt We used the official prompt of HLE for scoring.
