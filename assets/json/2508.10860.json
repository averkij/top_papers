            "content": "Interpreting, or oral translation, is complex yet pivotal linguistic competency that offers extensive educational benefits by fostering advanced linguistic, communicational, cognitive, and emotional It capabilities (Pöchhacker, 2001; Gile, 2021). enhances active listening (Lee, 2013), oral proficiency (Han and Lu, 2025), vocabulary acquisition (Chen, 2024), and cross-cultural communication (Stachl-Peier, 2020), while also strengthening higher-order cognitive functions (Dong and Xie, *daenerystargaryen@sjtu.edu.cn 1 2014) and anxiety management capabilities (Zhao, 2022). Given its multifaceted benefits, interpreting has increasingly been recognized as both valuable pedagogical tool and the fifth skill (Mellinger, 2018) alongside listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The intricate nature of interpreting necessitates continuous cycle of structured practice, rigorous assessment, and diagnostic feedback (Gile, 2021). However, traditional human-based assessment often requires raters to simultaneously consult the source text, the interpreted output, and detailed rating scales, cognitively demanding process that increases the risk of scoring bias and inconsistency (Lee, 2019; Han et al., 2024). The inherent limitations of human evaluation have spurred considerable interest in automated assessment. However, existing works are characterized by both thematic imbalance and methodological constraints. Among the three established dimensions of interpreting quality (fidelity, fluency, and language use), investigations have disproportionately focused on the first two, while language use has received scant scholarly attention (Yu and van Heuven, 2017; Han and Yang, 2023; Wang and Wang, 2022; Han and Lu, 2021; Lu and Han, 2022). Furthermore, prior research has predominantly relied on conventional statistical methods such as correlation and regression analyses (Yu and van Heuven, 2017; Wang and Wang, 2022; Han and Lu, 2021; Lu and Han, 2022), which are based on assumptions of linearity that often do not hold in complex, real-world datasets. The advent of machine learning (ML) algorithms and large language models (LLMs) presents novel opportunities to analyze complex data patterns that elude traditional statistical methods. Nevertheless, notable obstacle in their application is the severe imbalance in data composition. Wang and Yuan (2023), for example, find their five-class classification model unable to identify performances at Figure 1: SHAP-Based global feature importance for InfoCom (left), FluDel (middle), and TLQual (right) predictions. Warmer tones (e.g., red) signify higher feature values and cooler tones (e.g., blue) indicate lower feature values. The features are arranged in descending order along the y-axis based on their global importance. The meaning of FluDel and TLQual features are given in Table 2, 3 respectively. the distributional extremes (very poor and very good), direct consequence of the imbalanced training data distribution. Another limitation is the inherent opacity of automated scoring systems. Jia and Aryadoust (2023), for instance, find moderate correlations between GPT-4s interpreting performance assessment and human-assigned scores. Crucially, the internal decision-making processes of the LLMs remained opaque, with only the final scores being accessible. This black box nature severely restricts the diagnostic and educational utility of LLM scores. In response to these challenges, we raise the following questions in this work: 1) Can we mitigate the underperformance of interpreting assessment models with data augmentation? 2) Which specific features of fidelity, fluency, and language use exhibit the strongest predictive power in interpreting assessment models? 3) What specific feature combinations influence individual student scores for each dimension of interpreting quality? To answer these questions, we introduce novel approach that combines feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques (Arrieta et al., 2019; Linardatos et al., 2020) to evaluate interpreting performance across three key dimensions: fidelity, fluency, and target language quality. After using Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to augment the data, we extract broad set of features including translation quality metrics, temporal measures, and syntactic complexity indices to predict interpreting performance. Based on these features, we predict performance separately for each of the three dimensions adopting multi-dimensional modeling strategy, which facilitates more fine-grained analysis of interpreting quality and provides clearer insights into the specific contributions of features to each criterion. Furthermore, we apply Shapley Value (SHAP) analysis to provide interpretable explanations at both global and individual levels. To the best of our knowledge, we represent the first systematic efforts to automate the assessment of target language quality in interpreting."

            "content": "The field of automated interpreting assessment is witnessing paradigm shift, moving from statistical methods toward more sophisticated neural models. To date, the application of ML to interpreting quality evaluation remains nascent but growing domain. The pioneering work by Le et al. (2016) developed estimators based on features from automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), finding that MT features are most influential in predicting interpretation quality. Following that, Stewart et al. (2018) adapted the QuEst++ quality estimation pipeline with Support Vector Regression to predict the performance of simultaneous interpreters. More recently, Wang and Yuan (2023) employed SVM and KNN algorithms to classify E-C interpretations, while Han et al. (2025) further advanced the domain by integrating neuralbased metrics with acoustic and linguistic indices through ordinal logistic regression."

            "title": "2.2 Dimensions of Interpreting Assessment",
            "content": "Information Completeness Information completeness, also known as fidelity, refers to the extent of informational, semantic, and pragmatic correspondence between source message and its translation (Han, 2018). Existing metrics for automatic fidelity assessment can be broadly categorized into two types: non-neural and neural-based. Non-neural metrics such as BLEU (Papineni 2 et al., 2002) and chrF (Popovic, 2015) mainly rely on statistical and lexical matching to quantify the overlap of word or character sequences between candidate translation and human reference. Although these metrics have been widely adopted in the past decades, they have also been criticized for their reliance on surface-level comparisons that may not capture deeper semantic equivalence (Castilho et al., 2018). In contrast, neural-based metrics are derived from pre-trained language models and transcend surface matching by comparing contextualized embeddings. Prominent examples include BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), CometKiwi (Rei et al., 2022), and xCOMET (Guerreiro et al., 2024). While Han and Lu (2025) report strong aggregate correlation between these scores and human evaluations on E-C interpreting, Lu and Han (2022) find that the non-neural metrics BLEU and NIST outperform BERTScore, suggesting that non-neural and neural metrics may capture distinct, and potentially complementary, facets of interpreting quality. Fluency Fluency is another key dimension of interpreting quality, reflecting how effectively and naturally an interpretation is delivered (Stenzl, 1983). In computational modeling, fluency features are typically classified into three categories (Tavakoli and Skehan, 2005): (1) speed fluency, which captures the rate and density of delivery; (2) breakdown fluency, which measures speech continuity through the absence of interruptions and pauses; and (3) repair fluency, which quantifies self-corrections and repetitions. Within interpreting empirical research, considerable evidence has underscored the high predictive power of speed fluency features such as speech rate, phonation time ratio, and articulation rate (Han and Yang, 2023; Han, 2015; Song, 2020; Yu and van Heuven, 2017), while other works have also identified breakdown fluency features (e.g. mean length of unfilled pauses) as strong predictors (Wang and Wang, 2022; Wu, 2021). In contrast, repair fluency features are less commonly employed and seldom show strong predictive effectiveness (Han, 2015). Target Language Use In interpreting assessment, target language quality typically refers to the grammaticality and idiomaticity of the target language output (Han, 2018). Automated assessment of this dimension is facilitated by advances in computational tools such as Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004), TAASSC (Kyle, 2016), L2SCA (Lu, 2010), and CCA (Hu et al., 2022b,a), which operationalize linguistic quality by calculating wide array of features from lexical and phraseological indices to measures of syntax and discourse. While these features have been extensively applied in L2 writing and speaking research (Lu, 2010; Kyle and Crossley, 2017; Chen et al., 2018), their application to translation and interpreting contexts remains nascent, though existing findings show considerable promise (Ouyang et al., 2021; Han et al., 2025, 2022). Yet, two key challenges remain. The first is the need for more fine-grained feature design and application. While coarse-grained metrics like T-unit complexity have long been valued (Ortega, 2003), recent research advocates for supplementing them with fine-grained, usage-based indices that can capture subtle structural variations and better predict language development (Norris and Ortega, 2009; Kyle and Crossley, 2017). The second challenge concerns language specificity, as most NLP tools are developed primarily for English and may not fully account for the linguistic characteristics of other languages, such as the lack of overt morphological inflections and unique phraseological constructions in Chinese (Li and Thompson, 1989; Hu et al., 2022b) This evolving landscape is further complicated by the advent of LLMs. recent large-scale study by Zhang et al. (2024b) demonstrates that GPT-4o achieves near-human accuracy in grammatical acceptability judgment, leading to questions in the optimal combination of analytical tools from established linguistic indices to emergent LLM-based judgments that offers the most robust predictive power for assessing language use in interpreting."

            "title": "Assessment",
            "content": "Despite the aforementioned results in automatic interpreting assessment, the empirical application of ML is hampered by two fundamental and interrelated data challenges in this domain: small sample size and imbalanced data composition. The field is largely characterized by studies that rely on small datasets (Yu and van Heuven, 2017; Lu and Han, 2022; Wang and Yuan, 2023; Wang and Wang, 2022), substantially increasing the risk of overfitting. This problem is further exacerbated by pronounced class imbalance, as most datasets are heavily skewed toward average performance, 3 with markedly fewer samples representing either very high or very low quality (Wang and Yuan, 2023; Han et al., 2025). To surmount these obstacles, data augmentation has emerged as critical methodological intervention capable of enhancing model robustness and validity (Mumuni and Mumuni, 2022). Common augmentation approaches include perturbation-based methods (adding Gaussian noise), interpolation techniques like SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002), and generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Mumuni and Mumuni, 2022). Among these, VAE offers three key advantages for ML-based interpreting assessment (Kingma and Welling, 2014). First, its probabilistic framework captures complex interdependencies within fidelity, fluency, and language use features. Second, the continuous latent space enables smooth interpolation between existing samples to create coherent variations. Third, VAE preserves feature-label correspondence (i.e., the direct link between each samples features and its corresponding interpreting quality score), which is crucial for maintaining assessment validity. Zhang et al. (2024a) also demostrate the empirical viability of this technique."

            "content": "in Educational Contexts As educational AI systems become more sophisticated, XAI techniques are essential for understanding and validating these systems, thereby ensuring reliability, trust, and fairness (Gilpin et al., 2018; Rudin, 2018). Current XAI techniques fall into two main categories: intrinsic and post-hoc approaches (Gilpin et al., 2018; Rudin, 2018; Arrieta et al., 2019; Linardatos et al., 2020). Intrinsic methods prioritize inherent interpretability by using transparent model architectures such as rule-based systems, decision trees, and linear models where coefficients In contrast, directly indicate feature influence. post-hoc methods explain already-trained blackbox models without altering their structure, providing insights into complex models that would otherwise remain opaque. Most popular post-hoc methods - such as SHAP (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) and LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) - provide feature attribution, while other methods also exist for example-based explanations and counterfactual explanations (Arrieta et al., 2019; Linardatos et al., 2020). Based on their scope, post-hoc methods Figure 2: Methodological workflow of this study. can also be categorized as either global explanation (illuminating overall model behavior across all instances) or local explanation (clarifying individual predictions). For XAI research in education, learning analytics represents the most substantial area (Parkavi et al., 2024; Balachandar and Venkatesh, 2024), while applications have also been seen in automated language assessment, with most studies concentrating on explaining factors influencing performance quality (Kumar and Boulanger, 2020; Tang et al., 2024). To our knowledge, Wang (2024) is the only existing work to focus on explainability in automated interpreting assessment, which classifies interpreting quality into 5 levels and provides global explanations of feature importance using correlation analysis."

After that, several machine learning models are trained to predict interpreting quality scores across different dimensions.

All participants, whose L1 is Chinese 4 and L2 is English, have passed CET-4 (College English Test), demonstrating satisfactory English proficiency. Before data collection, they completed 16 weeks (32 credit hours) of interpreting training. The interpreting task uses six passages adapted from authentic public speeches, each containing an equal number of sentences and controlled for sentence length (M = 18.14 words, SD = 0.78 word). Further details about the passages, along with extracted linguistic feature values, are presented in Appendix A. These texts are converted into audio format using ElevenLabs text-to-speech technology1. The resulting audio files feature standard pronunciation and averaged approximately 2 minutes in duration. Assessment of the interpreting samples is conducted by three experienced raters, each with over three years of university-level teaching experience in domestic or international settings. The evaluation employes Han (2018)s four-band, eight-point analytic rubric, which assesses the three key dimensions of interpreting quality: InfoCom (information completeness), FluDel (fluency), and TLQual (target language quality). To ensure scoring consistency, raters underwent comprehensive training before the formal assessment. Detailed descriptions of the rater training procedures, student separation reliability, and the infit and outfit mean square statistics for each rater are provided in Appendix B. To mitigate potential inconsistencies and rater bias, Many-Facet Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis (Linacre, 2002) is used to calibrate raw scores and establish the final ground truth scores."

To enhance annotation reliability, we implement two-stage error detection process. In the first stage, GPT-4o3 is used for grammatical error diagnosis by adapting the framework of Rao et al. (2020) and Fu et al. (2018). structured prompt template (see Appendix C) is designed to guide GPT-4os annotations, providing explicit instructions on four major error types: Redundant Words (R), Missing Words (M), Word Selection Errors (S), and Word Ordering Errors (W).

Particularly, we specify in the guidelines that filled pauses (e.g., uh) are not considered errors, and analysis should focus solely on the final sentence version, disregarding repetitions, false starts, or self-corrections. In the second stage, each transcription is manually reviewed and corrected. We recruited two postgraduate students in linguistics to independently annotate 100 randomly selected sentences, following the same guidelines as GPT. Inter-annotator agreement among human annotators yields Cohens Kappa coefficient of 0.86, while agreement between GPT-4o annotations and human annotations achieves Fleiss Kappa coefficient of 0.71, indicating substantial level of consistency. 3.3 Feature Extraction Each scoring dimension of interpreting is represented by distinct set of extracted features. Fluency features are extracted from the original transcript, while other features are derived from cleaned transcripts (after removing fillers, false starts, and self-repair). For InfoCom, we use five established metrics from the field of machine translation quality assessment to measure the preservation of information from source to target language  (Table 1)  . FluDel features include 14 temporal features  (Table 2)  derived from prior research (Barik, 1973; Yu and van Heuven, 2017; Song, 2020; Wang and Wang, 2022). These features can be categorized into two groups: speed fluency features (16) and breakdown fluency features (714). Features related to unfilled pauses are extracted automatically using Python packages librosa (v0.10.2) and soundfile (v0.12.1), with pauses identified based on an intensity threshold of -18 dB as recommended by Wu (2021). Additional features are derived from time-aligned transcriptions generated by the iFLYTEK ASR system. TLQual is evaluated through 25 features related to syntactic complexity and grammatical accuracy. Among them, 21 syntactic complexity features encompassing both coarse-grained and fine-grained measures  (Table 3)  are extracted using Chinese Collocation Analyzer (CCA, Hu et al., 2022b,a), which is specifically developed for L2 Chinese texts, making it particularly appropriate for E-C interpreting studies.

This scarcity underscores the need for data augmentation techniques to increase the quantity and diversity of learner datasets (Mumuni and Mumuni, 2022). In line with the approach proposed by Zhang et al. (2024a), we employ Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to address the challenge of score distribution imbalance in the original dataset. The primary objective is to generate realistic, synthetic feature vectors for the three distinct dimensions of interpreting quality being assessed. To achieve this, we train separate conditional VAE for each of the three dimensions.

Three types of machine learning models XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) are employed to predict the InfoCom, FluDel, and TLQual scores. The modeling process followes systematic procedure that consists of feature extraction, feature standardization, data splitting, model training and validation, and model testing (Mienye and Sun, 2022). All extracted features (as detailed in Section 3.3) are first standardized using z-score normalization. The initial dataset is then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. Following the data split, model training and validation are conducted with five-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameters, using root mean square error (RMSE) as validation criterion. After cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing configuration is selected for each model. Each final model is then retrained on the entire training set using the optimal hyperparameters and subsequently evaluated on the held-out test set to assess its predictive performance on unseen data. Multiple evaluation metrics are employed in this stage to provide comprehensive assessment of model quality, including: (1) RMSE: measures the magnitude of prediction errors. (2) Spearmans (ρ): assesses the monotonic relationship between predicted and actual scores. (3) Mean absolute error (MAE): quantifies the average absolute deviation between predicted and actual scores, providing direct measure of predic- (4) Mann-Whitney Test: determines whether there are significant differences in the distributions of predicted and actual scores. (5) Exact Agreement rate (EAR): quantifies the proportion of predictions that exactly match the actual scores after both are rounded to the nearest integer. Rounding is required because our models predict continuous MFRM-calibrated scores (1-8), and agreement is typically assessed against discrete levels. (6) Adjacent Agreement rate (AAR): measures the proportion of predictions that fall within one integer unit (either +1 or -1) of the actual scores after both are rounded to the nearest integer. Beyond these overall metric values, we also perform case studies of prediction errors to gain more in-depth insights into specific aspects of the models performance."

The plot is centered around the base value (approximately 5.4), representing the mean model output across the training dataset. The cumulative contributions of the InfoCom features slightly elevate the prediction to 5.66. Among these, BLEURT 9 Figure 5: SHAP force plot for the InfoCom prediction of Sample 25. Figure 6: SHAP waterfall plot for the predicted FluDel score of Sample 50. and COMET-Kiwi exert the most significant positive influence, whereas chrF contributes negatively. The relatively high BLEURT and COMET-Kiwi scores suggest that Sample 25 retains most of the source information, albeit with some loss, while the markedly low chrF score indicates substantial lexical and syntactic divergence from the reference text. In Figure 6, the SHAP waterfall plot for the FluDel prediction of Sample 50 is shown. The expected value E[f(x)] = 4.991 represents the mean model output across the training dataset. Feature contributions collectively reduce the prediction to f(x) = 4.746. Among these, the pause-related features - NFP, MLUP, and NUP - exhibit the most pronounced negative impact, decreasing the prediction by 0.22, 0.16, and 0.1, respectively. Conversely, MLR has the strongest positive effect, increasing the prediction by 0.2. These findings suggest that the interpreter may need to enhance pause management by minimizing both the frequency and duration of pauses while striving for more extended, uninterrupted speech production. The SHAP waterfall plot for the TLQual prediction of Sample 87 is depicted in Figure 7. The models expected value is E[f(x)] = 5.258, with Figure 7: SHAP waterfall plot for the predicted TLQual score of Sample 87. feature contributions collectively increasing the prediction to 6.466. Among these, CN_RATIO is the most influential positive factor, increasing the prediction by 0.47. Other contributing features include PC_RTTR, AP_RTTR, PV_RTTR, and AP_RATIO. Conversely, PP_RTTR exerts the most significant negative influence, reducing the prediction by 0.44, with additional negative contributions from PV_RATIO and MLC. These results indicate that the diversified and sophisticated use of CN, PC, AP, PV, and AP structures aligns with typical language patterns in this context. However, excessive use of PP structures (e.g. 在...上, 当...时) appears detrimental. Additionally, the negative impact of MLC suggests that complex clauses could be restructured into simpler sentences or reformulated using topic-comment structure, common grammatical pattern in Chinese."

            "content": "data augmentation Our analysis indicates that the selected machine learning algorithms demonstrate robust performance on the augmented dataset, with RF yielding the best results for InfoCom score estimation and XGBoost performing best on FluDel and TLQual. 10 Comparing with previous models that only perform well on middle range scores but failing at lower and higher ranges (Han et al., 2025; Wang and Yuan, 2023), our results underscore the importance of data augmentation in improving model performance, particularly for predicting scores at extreme ends of the scale. 5.2 Global explanations of feature importance Information completeness Our SHAP analysis identifies the two neural-based metrics, BLEURT and CometKiwi, as having the greatest influence on the global prediction of InfoCom scores, aligning with previous research by Han and Lu (2025). The superior performance of BLEURT is likely attributable to its extensive pre-training on synthetic data and its ability to incorporate diverse lexical and semantic signals, which enables the metric to capture more nuanced linguistic patterns compared to BERTScore (Han and Lu, 2025). Conversely, the relatively low performance of XCOMET may stem from misalignment between its training paradigm (error annotation) and the assessment context (analytical rubric scoring). Fluency of delivery Our findings reveal that NFP has the most pronounced negative impact on the models global prediction of FluDel scores, followed by other pause-related features including MLUP, NUP, and MLFP, aligning with previous findings (Yu and van Heuven, 2017). In contrast, most speed fluency features (e.g. PSC, PTR, SR) exhibit small positive effects, although higher MLR values are linked to decreased predictions. We hypothesize that the negative role of MLR stems from the phenomenon that excessively long runs do not reflect controlled, fluent delivery but rather form of run-on speech. The interpreter, under high cognitive load, may be rushing to output information without strategic pausing for emphasis or listener comprehension (Lennon, 1990; Mead, 2005), leading to human raters perceiving the speech as poorly managed and difficult to process. Target language quality Among the GPT-4oannotated features, NWSE exerts significant negative effect on model predictions, underscoring the foundational role of grammatical accuracy in human judgments of language quality and mirroring findings in L2 speaking assessment (Li et al., 2024). Regarding length-related features, MLS has positive effect on predictions, aligning with Zechner et al. (2017). MLC, on the other hand, yields negative impact, which is in sharp contrast to findings from other contexts such as L2 German and English speaking (Neary-Sundquist, 2017; Bulté and Roothooft, 2020). This divergence likely stems from typological differences: the topic-comment structure of Chinese prioritizes discourse coherence, whereas the syntactic elaboration common in English relies more heavily on complex clausal dependencies (Li and Thompson, 1989). This suggests that in the Chinese interpreting context, longer but less syntactically dense sentences are perceived as higher quality. Another key finding is the superior predictive importance of fine-grained features over coarsegrained ones. Within this category, features reflecting phraseological diversity (PC_RTTR, PP_RTTR, SP_RTTR, AP_RTTR, PV_RTTR) are more influential than the single phraseological complexity feature (CN_RATIO). Furthermore, our results reveal that Chinese-specific phraseological features (CN, PC, PP, PV) demonstrate greater importance than their language-independent counterparts (SP, AP). Taken together, these findings point towards the possibility that for E-C consecutive interpreting, robust assessment of language use relies less on traditional measures of clausal complexity and more on the diverse and accurate use of languagespecific phrasal units."

            "title": "5.3 The critical role of local explanations in\nautomated interpreting assessment",
            "content": "Local explanations in automated interpreting assessment offer significant value for both teaching and learning practices (Kumar and Boulanger, 2020; Tang et al., 2024; Gilpin et al., 2018; Rudin, 2018; Linardatos et al., 2020). For educators, these explanations provide actionable insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of individual students performances by highlighting the features that positively or negatively influence predicted scores. This enables teachers to tailor feedback and instructional strategies to target precise areas for improvement. For students, local explanations empower students to take ownership of their learning by focusing on specific performance aspects that require attention. Take the SHAP-based local explanation of FluDel prediction for Sample 50 as an example. Notably, pause-related features emerge as the primary detractors: NFP reduces the prediction by 0.22, MLUP by 0.16, and NUP by 0.1, indicating the students difficulty with hesitation management. 11 To address this, instructors can implement targeted exercises such as shadowing practices, where students reproduce source language with minimal delay (Christoffels and de Groot, 2004). The instructor could also implement targeted drills requiring students to deliver short segments without hesitation, progressively extending segment length while monitoring pause reduction. For reducing unfilled pauses specifically, anticipation exercises help students predict upcoming content elements, thereby decreasing processing latency (Chmiel, 2020). Additionally, instructing in chunking strategies - organizing information into manageable units - can alleviate cognitive load that frequently manifests as extended pauses (Thalmann et al., 2019). In addition, the quantitative nature of SHAP values also allows instructors to prioritize interventions effectively. For this particular student, addressing filled pauses should take precedence over lengthy unfilled pauses, given its greater negative impact (0.22 vs. 0.16). Furthermore, tracking these SHAP contributions longitudinally across multiple performances enables instructors to monitor learning progression and intervention effectiveness, facilitating timely adjustments to teaching approaches as needed."

Global XAI analysis reveales that fidelity prediction is most sensitive to neural-embedding metrics such as BLEURT, while fluency scores are primarily influenced by breakdown features, with NFP exerting the strongest negative effect. Target language quality, in turn, depends heavily on language-specific phraseological features, notably CN_RATIO. These global insights are complemented by in-depth local explanations, which effectively diagnose individual strengths and weaknesses in performance. Looking forward, our method provides promising direction in translating XAI-driven insights into pedagogical tools that deliver actionable feedback to trainees, thereby bridging the gap between automated assessment and student learning."

            "content": "To familiarize the raters with the assessment procedures, we arranged an online training session via video conferencing software. Two authors of this study introduced the source texts and corresponding reference interpretations, and clarified certain key terms within the analytic rating scales (e.g. filled pauses, long silence, and excessive repairs). Raters were actively encouraged to seek clarification on any aspect of the rating task, so as to ensure shared understanding of the assessment criteria. To enhance rating consistency, pre-scored, representative interpretations from each band were played and analyzed collectively. This served to illustrate the typical features associated with different performance levels. Subsequently, the raters independently completed trial ratings of five additional interpretations. After that, they engaged in collaborative discussion, comparing their scores and providing justifications for their rating decisions. The formal rating was also conducted remotely, with each rater receiving secure online access to all necessary materials, including the source texts, reference translations, and the anonymized interpretations. To ensure ample time for thorough evaluation, raters were given two weeks to complete their assessments."

            "title": "C Prompt for Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis",
            "content": "Prompt for Chinese grammatical error diagnosis **Instruction** You are Chinese grammar expert. Your task is to diagnose and correct grammatical errors in Chinese sentences or longer texts. Follow the steps and guidelines below meticulously: 1. Error Detection and Analysis Order Analyze the input text for potential errors in the following priority order: - Redundancy (R): Repeated words or characters that unnecessarily clutter the sentence. - Missing Words (M): Omitted words or particles that make the sentence incomplete or ambiguous. - Word Selection (S): Inappropriate or inaccurate word choices that should be replaced by more context-appropriate terms. - Word Order (W): Incorrect arrangement of words or phrases that distorts the intended meaning. 2. Error Description and Correction For each detected error: - Describe the nature of the error. - Propose correction that clarifies the meaning while preserving the original intent. - Assign confidence score (01) representing your certainty in the correction. (Scores closer to 1 indicate high confidence.) 3. Re-examination for Low Confidence If an error receives confidence score below 0.7, re-examine it by asking: - Does this correction improve the sentence without introducing ambiguity? - Is the error type correctly classified? Revise the correction if necessary before finalizing your output. 4. Handling Special Cases The following special cases should be addressed: - Filled Pauses: Words such as 呃, 额, and 嗯 (and similar utterance markers) are considered fillers and should be ignored during error analysis. Do not report these as grammatical errors. - Repeated Phrases, False Starts, and Self-Corrections: Only analyze the final output of the sentence. Ignore any extraneous parts resulting from repetition or self-correction. 5. Output Formatting For every detected error, output an entry using the following format: [sentence_id, start_index, end_index, error_type, corrected_text, confidence] - sentence_id: unique identifier for the sentence (or text segment) under analysis. - start_index and end_index: The character positions (based on the sentences index) where the error occurs. - error_type: One of the following codes: (Redundancy), (Missing Words), (Word Selection), or (Word Order). - corrected_text: The proposed correction. - confidence: numerical value between 0 and 1 that represents your certainty. 6. Multiple Errors Note that sentence or text passage may contain more than one error. In such cases, output each error as separate entry. 7. Examples for Illustration 17 - Example 1: Simple Redundancy Correction - Input: 我昨天去学校学校了 - Expected Output: [1, 6, 7, R, 学校, 0.95] - Reasoning: The particle 了 is repeated unnecessarily (positions 67). The extra 了 should be removed. High confidence is given due to the unambiguous redundancy. - Example 2: Word Order Correction - Input: 他跑得快比我还 - Expected Output: [2, 4, 6, W, 比我还快, 0.85] - Reasoning: The phrase 跑得快比我还 is mis-ordered. Reordering to 比我还快 aligns with natural Chinese word order. - Example 3: Word selection improvement - Input: 不受监管的移民活动会造成移民进入许多危险的路线, 也会遭到人口贩卖者的残 忍魔爪 - Expected Output: Entry 1: [3, 10, 11, S, 让, 0.95] Entry 2: [3, 25, 28, S, 移民会落入, 0.90] - Reasoning: Entry 1: 造成 is not suitable verb. Entry 2: 遭到 is not natural collocation with 魔爪. The verb 落入 better conveys that immigrants fall into the clutches (魔爪) of human traffickers. Additionally, the extra adverb 也 is unnecessary. - Example 4: Handling Special Cases - Input: 呃我觉得今天的会议嗯没啥大问题 - Expected Output: No error entries. - Reasoning: 呃 or 嗯 are neglected. Only the final phrasing after self-corrections and filler pauses should be examined for genuine grammatical issues."

            "content": "Sample 47 Key features features Key (MSD) for Score 6 samples Error analysis From the original dataset; RF model True score: 6.34; Predicted score: 5.29 BLEURT: 0.66; CometKiwi: 0.62; chrF: 0.07; BERTScore: 0.97; xCOMET: 0.35 BLEURT (0.540.13); CometKiwi (0.540.10); chrF (0.130.02); BERTScore (0.960.01); xCOMET (0.210.12) The model underestimates the InfoCom score of Sample 47 by 1.05. Upon examining samples within the 5.56.5 score range, we observe that Sample 47 exhibits particularly low chrF score (0.07). This value is more than one standard deviation below the mean (0.11) for this feature among samples in this range. Analysis of the corresponding student transcript reveals tendency to reorder sentence components during interpretation, though key information in the source speech is interpreted faithfully into the target language. For instance, when interpreting an if...then... sentence, the student processes the then clause before the if clause, which results in reduced n-gram matching and consequently lower chrF score for this sample. Table 9: Cases of notable disagreement between machine and human scores for InfoCom. Sample 95 Sample features (MSD) Features for Score 5 samples Error analysis From the original dataset; XGBoost model True score: 4.73; Predicted score: 3.48 NFP: 13; MLR: 20.64; MLUP: 1.18; NUP: 42; MLFP: 0.26; PSC: 185; SR: 1.53; PTR: 0.41; NRSA: 2; MLS: 0.25 NFP (18.165.66); MLR (17.131.11); MLUP (1.020.11); NUP (30.46.73); MLFP (0.380.12); PSC (195.9613.44); SR (1.720.25); PTR (0.450.24); NRSA (4.43.55); MLS (0.270.04) For Sample 95, the model underestimates the FluDel score by 1.25 points. Analysis of this samples features reveals notably high values for MLUP (1.18) and NUP (42), both approximately two standard deviations above their respective means. Also, the speech rate (1.53) is lower than the mean (1.72). Collectively, these feature values likely lead the model to interpret this sample as having more significant breakdowns and reduced speaking speed. However, qualitative examination of the corresponding student recording offers contrasting perspective. While the student does exhibit longer and more frequent pauses than average, these disfluencies predominantly occur at boundaries between semantic units within sentences. For human rates, this placement of pauses does not hurt perceived fluency as much as within-phrase disfluencies, which may explain why the actual perceived score is higher than the models prediction based on these automated features. Table 10: Cases of notable disagreement between machine and human scores for FluDel. 20 Sample 62 Key features Key features (MSD) for Score 6 samples Error analysis From the original dataset; XGBoost model True score: 6.22; Predicted score: 5.01 CN_RATIO: 0; PC_RTTR: 0; MLS: 19.57; PP_RTTR: 1; SP_RTTR: 0.71; AP_RTTR: 2; MLC: 14; NWSE: 0.26; PV_RTTR: 0.89; MLTU: 17.11 CN_RATIO (0.010.01); PC_RTTR (0.990.39); MLS (21.367.18); PP_RTTR (0.810.29); SP_RTTR (2.540.35); AP_RTTR (3.230.44); MLC (17.081.30); NWSE (1.690.74); PV_RTTR (0.980.34); MLTU (19.731.56) The predicted score is 1.21 points lower than that assigned by human raters. contributing factor to this discrepancy may be the notable absence of two specific Chinese structures, CN and PC expressions, in the students interpretation. Instead, the students frequently employ expressions characteristic of Westernized Chinese, style influenced by Western language structures. While human raters appear to find these alternative expressions acceptable within the context of the task, the model likely penalizes the lack of the expected native Chinese forms, leading to the observed lower scores.
