            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external knowledge to solve knowledge-intensive tasks that require multi-hop reasoning with dispersed evidence. Rather than continually retraining models to absorb newly emerging knowledge, recent systems augment LLMs with external text corpora and structured knowledge graphs (KGs) through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and structured knowledge integration (KG-RAG). While these approaches have demonstrated strong empirical gains, fundamental question remains unresolved: how much additional reasoning do retrieval-augmented models actually contribute beyond the base LLM? Recent studies have indicated that pretraining contamination, the overlap between benchmark data and model pretraining corpora, can inflate performance and undermine fair comparison across model generations [10, 23, 25, 32, 33, 40]. This issue is severe for hybrid KG-RAG methods, such as Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) [22], Reasoning-on-Graph (RoG) [28], Think-on-Graph (ToG) [34], Planon-Graph (PoG) [6], which are explicitly designed to incorporate structured retrieval, graph traversal, and multi-hop reasoning. To evaluate these methods meaningfully, benchmarks must require models to retrieve relevant evidence from large external sources and compose multiple facts through reasoning; however, the validity of existing benchmarks is increasingly questionable due to Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Junhong Lin, Bing Zhang, Song Wang, Ziyan Liu, Dan Gutfreund, Julian Shun, and Yada Zhu Table 1: Average accuracy (%) and standard deviation of directly prompting several LLMs with different knowledge cutoff times on the Movie and Sports Q&A datasets (developed in March 2024), calculated over 5 runs. The best results are highlighted in bold. LLM (Cutoff Time) Qwen2-72B (June 2023) Qwen2.5-72B (October 2023) LMArena [8] OpenLLMLeaderboard [12] 1263 43.59% 1303 (+3.1%) 47.98% (+4.4%) Qwen3-32B (mid-2024) 1347 (+6.7%) Movie (All) Sports (All) 24.42 0.38 34.27 0.32 (+40.3%) 16.17 0.45 23.78 0.20 (+47.1%) 43.86 1.00 (+79.6%) 32.71 0.96 (+102%) Movie (Fast-changing Facts) Sports (Fast-changing Facts) 5.38 2.11 15.58 0.45 (+189%) 3.79 0.34 11.56 0.26 (+205%) 22.31 1.05 (+315%) 27.39 0.40 (+622%) both pretraining contamination and the difficulty of continually constructing well-grounded multi-hop questions at scale to shed light on models strengths and weaknesses. Many widely-used multi-hop QA benchmarks, such as HotpotQA (2018) [43], MetaQA (2018) [46], CWQ (2018) [35], TriviaQA (2017) [19], WebQuestions (2013) [2], were constructed before the widespread deployment of LLMs and rely on manual curation over static knowledge sources that widely exist in LLM pretraining corpora, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of retrieval and reasoning modules. The impact of this overlap is apparent. For example, when asked What is the latest film that Denis Villeneuve has been involved in?, both Qwen2-72B and Qwen2.5-72B (trained in 2023) incorrectly answer Dune (2021), while Qwen3-32B (trained in 2024) correctly answers Dune: Part Two (2024), despite identical prompting and comparable (even smaller) model parameter size. More broadly, we consider controlled motivating example by directly prompting them on two CRAG datasets (Movie and Sports) [42] developed in March 2024. As shown in Table 1, the QA accuracy increases sharply (up to +102%) with later pretraining cutoffs, while improvements on general reasoning benchmarks remain modest (+6.7%), which cannot solely explain these QA accuracy improvements. When restricting evaluation to questions tagged with involving fast-changing facts, earlier models achieve near-zero accuracy. These results indicate that benchmark performance can be dominated by pretraining exposure rather than retrieval or reasoning ability, obscuring genuine methodological progress. To address this gap, we introduce HybridRAG-Bench, fully automated benchmark construction framework designed to faithfully evaluate retrieval-intensive and multi-hop reasoning. HybridRAGBench explicitly externalizes all knowledge required for question answering, thereby satisfying four key properties for valid evaluation. (1) To ensure questions are derived from recent and evolving sources, HybridRAG-Bench collects time-framed scientific corpora from user-specified topics on arXiv, reducing overlap with LLM pretraining data and ensuring that correctness depends on retrieval rather than memorization. (2) To guarantee that questions are knowledge-intensive and sufficiently difficult, the framework constructs hybrid knowledge environment consisting of aligned text chunks and extracted knowledge graphs, making the location, structure, and provenance of required knowledge explicit. (3) To support diverse reasoning behaviors, HybridRAG-Bench generates challenging questionanswer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths that cover single-hop lookup, conditional reasoning, multihop inference, hard multi-hop chains, counterfactual reasoning, and open-ended synthesis. (4) To maintain scalability, automation, and reusability, HybridRAG-Bench automatically validates QA quality and enables rapid regeneration of benchmarks across new topics, time periods, and knowledge scopes without manual curation. By meeting these criteria, HybridRAG-Bench provides robust and evolving testbed for evaluating retrieval-augmented and multi-hop reasoning systems. HybridRAG-Bench makes the following contributions: benchmarking framework for retrieval-intensive reasoning. HybridRAG-Bench is reusable benchmark construction framework for evaluating multi-hop reasoning over hybrid structured and unstructured knowledge. The framework generates diverse, knowledge-intensive questions grounded in latent knowledge graph paths, yielding challenges that require genuine retrieval and reasoning. The code and data of HybridRAGBench is available at github.com/junhongmit/HybridRAG-Bench. Diagnostic benchmark instances for RAG and KG-RAG methods. Using the proposed framework, HybridRAG-Bench instantiates evaluation benchmarks that expose clear and consistent performance gaps across retrieval and reasoning strategies, distinguishing naïve augmentation from effective hybrid reasoning over text and graphs. Controlled evaluation of retrieval versus memorization. HybridRAG-Bench enables systematic control over domains and document time ranges, allowing principled evaluation of whether performance gains stem from genuine retrieval and multi-hop reasoning rather than parametric memorization."

Retrieval-Augmented and Knowledge-Grounded LLMs. To overcome the limitations of parametric knowledge and avoid the cost of continual pretraining, large body of work has explored augmenting LLMs with external knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or from knowledge graphs. Text-based RAG [1, 21] methods retrieve unstructured documents to improve factual accuracy, while KG-based approaches leverage structured graphs for relational and multi-hop reasoning. Specifically for knowledge graph reasoning and retrieval: CoK [22] iteratively retrieves external knowledge from unstructured text, knowledge graphs, and tables into subsequent reasoning steps; RoG [28] relies on questionspecific subgraph and allows self-correcting erroneous reasoning paths; ToG [34] and ToG2.0 [29] optimize retrieval by performing path expansion and pruning based on seed entities and context; PoG [6] and R2-KG [18] improve answer reliability by enhancing LLM-based judging during exploration and answering. To reason over temporal facts (e.g., TimeQuestions [17], MultiTQ [7]), EvoReasoner [26] includes relation and entity reranking based on their temporal alignment with reasoning subgoals. While these frameworks offer diverse advantages in relational reasoning and hallucination reduction, they are primarily evaluated using static benchmarks such as WebQSP [44], CWQ [35], GrailQA [15], HotpotQA [43] and MetaQA [46]. These benchmarks are constructed once from Freebase [3], DBpedia [20], and Wikidata [37]. Consequently, their reported performance can be overestimated due to the overlap between the models internal parametric knowledge and the external knowledge used for evaluation."

Concretely, HybridRAG-Bench follows four-stage pipeline. First, given userspecified topic filters and time ranges, the framework collects timeframed arXiv corpora that define the external knowledge source available to retrieval-based methods. Second, it constructs hybrid knowledge environments by extracting aligned unstructured text chunks and structured knowledge graphs from the corpus, enabling both document retrieval and graph-based traversal. Third, the framework generates diverse question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths and supporting evidence, covering single-hop, conditional, multi-hop, hard multi-hop, counterfactual, and openended reasoning. Finally, an automated quality control stage filters and validates generated questions to ensure answerability, independence from document-specific phrasing, and non-redundancy. Together, these components enable reproducible construction of retrieval-intensive benchmarks for evaluating RAG and KG-RAG methods under controlled knowledge settings. We next describe each stage in detail."

Document collection is performed over configurable time window, enabling evaluation under different knowledge cutoff regimes. In our experiments, we select document windows that postdate the public pretraining cutoffs of contemporary LLMs, reducing the likelihood that answers can be recovered via parametric memorization alone. For each paper, the parsed text, section-level segmentation (e.g., abstract, introduction, methods), and metadata, including title, authors, categories, and submission timestamps, are stored.

The resulting graph captures entities (e.g., methods, datasets, tasks, policies) and relations expressed in the literature, and is constructed independently for each domain. Entity Extraction and Alignment. Given batch of documents, EvoKG applies large language model to extract candidate entities and relations. Extracted entities may exhibit lexical variation (e.g., abbreviated method names), semantic ambiguity, or partial descriptions. To address this, EvoKG performs context-aware entity alignment, matching each extracted entity against existing KG nodes using joint embeddings over entity type, name, and description. If no existing node exceeds similarity threshold, new entity is created; otherwise, the extracted mention is merged with the matched node, preserving provenance information. This alignment step prevents entity fragmentation and ensures consistency across documents and time. Relation Normalization and Evidence Tracking. Extracted relations are normalized to domain-specific schema and linked to supporting textual evidence. Rather than enforcing single canonical fact, the knowledge graph retains multiple candidate relations when supported by the corpus, along with confidence scores derived from frequency, recency, and textual support. This design allows the graph to represent uncertainty and variation commonly observed in scientific writing. The resulting knowledge graph provides structured relational scaffolding that complements the unstructured document corpus, enabling hybrid retrieval and reasoning."

We first sample reasoning paths from the knowledge graph of the form 𝑟1 𝑣 𝑝 = (𝑣0 𝑟2 . . . 𝑟𝑘 𝑣𝑘 ), where 𝑣𝑘 is the answer entity. Each sampled path defines valid relational structure connecting the question subject to its answer. For every entity and relation along the path, we retrieve the associated supporting text spans from the corpus, which provide contextual descriptions, qualifiers, and evidence. Hybrid Question Construction. For all question types, we condition large language model on structured context that includes: (1) sampled reasoning path from the knowledge graph, which specifies the relational constraints, (2) textual evidence associated with the entities and relations along the path, and (3) small set of in-context examples illustrating the desired question format. The reasoning path serves as structural scaffold, while the textual context guides natural language formulation and enables questions that require interpretation or synthesis beyond symbolic lookup. The model is instructed to generate question that is faithful to the provided evidence and to produce ground-truth answer that can be verified from the same context. If the available evidence is insufficient to support well-posed question (e.g., missing attributes or ambiguous relations), the model is explicitly instructed to abstain from generating an example. Using this hybrid grounding mechanism, we generate diverse set of questionanswer pairs. The distribution of question types across domains is summarized in Table 2. Single-hop questions. These questions correspond to single relation lookup (𝑣0, 𝑟, 𝑣1). The generated question directly queries an attribute or relation of the subject entity, while the answer is the terminal entity or value supported by both the KG edge and its textual evidence. Single-hop questions with conditions. In addition to single KG relation, these questions include explicit constraints extracted from textual descriptions, such as temporal qualifiers (e.g., in 2018), categorical restrictions, or contextual conditions. The condition is derived from attributes or modifiers mentioned in the supporting text, requiring models to align symbolic relations with unstructured qualifiers. Multi-hop questions. These questions are grounded in reasoning paths with 𝑘 2 relations. Answering them requires composing multiple relational steps and retrieving evidence across intermediate entities. The question is formulated to obscure the intermediate nodes, requiring implicit multi-hop inference. Difficult multi-hop questions. To increase difficulty, we preferentially sample paths that traverse high-degree entities in the knowledge graph. Such entities introduce large candidate spaces and increase the likelihood of spurious retrieval, placing greater demands on both retrieval precision and reasoning robustness. Counterfactual questions. Counterfactual questions are constructed by minimally perturbing relation or attribute in the original reasoning path (e.g., replacing method, dataset, or condition) and asking how the outcome or conclusion would change. The generated answers are constrained to provide cautious, evidence-based reasoning without introducing unsupported facts. Open-ended questions. Open-ended questions require synthesizing explanations or summaries from multiple pieces of textual evidence aligned with reasoning path. Rather than returning single entity, the answer is short, evidence-grounded natural language response that integrates information from several nodes and relations."

We instantiate HybridRAG-Bench on three domain-specific corpora collected from recent arXiv papers: AI (reinforcement learning), CY (governance and policy), and BIO (bioinformatics). For each domain, we construct domain-specific knowledge graph and generate approximately 1,000 questionanswer pairs grounded in explicit graph paths and supporting textual evidence. As shown in Table 2, the questions cover single-hop, conditional single-hop, multi-hop, hard multi-hop, counterfactual, and open-ended reasoning. We manually inspect subset of the generated data to verify question quality and faithfulness. For answer evaluation, we adopt an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol following CRAG [42], using the same judge prompt and evaluation models to assess answer correctness and faithfulness. Baselines.

            "content": "RQ2: Does HybridRAG-Bench Require External Retrieval? Introducing external retrieval leads to large and consistent performance gains. As observed in Table 3, for example, text-based RAG improves accuracy by 729 absolute points over LLM-only prompting across most modeldomain combinations, with the exception of DeepSeek-V3.2 on Arxiv-CY. These gains demonstrate that external knowledge is critical for answering HybridRAG-Bench questions. Without retrieval, models fail to obtain the domain-specific and up-to-date information required by the benchmark. Notably, naïve KG-based augmentation can degrade performance relative to LLMonly prompting. Directly injecting one-hop graph neighborhoods without selective retrieval or structured reasoning introduces substantial noise, distracting the model from relevant evidence. This highlights that HybridRAG-Bench does not merely reward access to more information, but specifically requires effective retrieval and evidence selection.

Hybrid KG-RAG KG-RAG that jointly leverage structured graph information and unstructured text consistently outperform text-only RAG baselines across all domains  (Table 3)  . While text-based RAG is effective for retrieving descriptive or explanatory information, it struggles with questions that require relational reasoning, entity disambiguation, or multi-hop composition. Structured knowledge graphs provide explicit relational scaffolding that complements unstructured retrieval, enabling more reliable traversal and reasoning. The consistent advantage of hybrid methods over text-only RAG demonstrates that structured knowledge offers additive value beyond unstructured retrieval alone. These results confirm that HybridRAG-Bench is sensitive to how models integrate text and graph evidence, making it suitable testbed for evaluating structured reasoning capabilities in KG-RAG systems. RQ4: Does HybridRAG-Bench Discriminate Between Retrieval and Reasoning Strategies? For clarity of analysis, we present per-question-type results  (Table 4)  using Qwen2.5-72B as representative strong open-source model; results for other LLMs exhibit consistent trends and are provided in the Appendix A. HybridRAG-Bench reveals substantial and consistent performance gaps among KG-RAG baselines, far exceeding the gains obtained by scaling LLM size alone  (Table 3)  . These gaps persist across domains and are especially pronounced when performance is analyzed by question type  (Table 4)  , indicating that the benchmark meaningfully differentiates retrieval and reasoning strategies. Several clear and interpretable trends emerge in the breakdown by question type: Multi-hop and hard multi-hop questions. KG-RAG methods that explicitly model graph structure (e.g., ToG, ToG2.0, EvoReasoner) consistently outperform text-only RAG. This reflects the importance of structured traversal and relational composition when reasoning requires chaining multiple facts. Single-hop and conditional questions. While these questions require limited multi-step composition, methods that effectively integrate both unstructured text and structured knowledge (e.g., ToG2.0, EvoReasoner, RAG+1-hop KG) consistently outperform text-only RAG and KG-only baselines. This suggests that even seemingly simple questions benefit from hybrid evidence integration, particularly when entity grounding or conditional constraints must be resolved. Open-ended questions. Methods with strong unstructured text retrieval perform better, highlighting the role of descriptive evidence and synthesis beyond discrete relational paths. Counterfactual questions. Performance on counterfactual queries correlates strongly with models reasoning capability rather than raw retrieval. Methods with explicit reasoning mechanisms (e.g., CoT, Self-Consistency, ToG2.0, EvoReasoner) achieve substantially higher accuracy, while naïve KG augmentation (1-hop KG) performs near zero. Inspection of model outputs shows that one-hop KG often induces overly cautious responses (e.g., dont know), as local graph neighborhoods provide insufficient support for hypothetical reasoning. This highlights that counterfactual questions primarily test reasoning and uncertainty handling, rather than factual retrieval alone. These results indicate that HybridRAG-Bench not only measures overall accuracy, but also diagnoses how different retrieval and reasoning mechanisms succeed or fail across distinct reasoning regimes. By disentangling performance across reasoning regimes, HybridRAG-Bench provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evaluating KG-RAG systems.

            "content": "Since HybridRAG-Bench relies on automatically constructed knowledge graphs, we evaluate whether our KG construction pipeline reliably recovers factual information from source documents. This analysis isolates the quality of KG extraction itself and does not involve downstream QA or reasoning performance. We measure fact recovery rate, defined as the fraction of verifiable facts from the source corpus that are successfully recovered in the constructed KG: Recovery Rate = Number of facts recovered from corpus Number of verifiable facts in corpus . We conduct this evaluation on the MINE benchmark [31], which contains 106 document corpora, each annotated with 15 manually verified facts. fact is considered recovered if it can be matched to at least one triplet in the constructed KG. Table 5 compares our pipeline with OpenIE, GraphRAG, and the state-of-the-art KGGen method. Our approach achieves the highest recovery rate, recovering approximately 71% of verifiable facts, outperforming KGGen by about 5 absolute points. These results indicate that the KG construction component of HybridRAG-Bench is effective at extracting factual structure from text and is competitive with prior state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, this suggests that the difficulty of HybridRAG-Bench does not stem from weak or incomplete knowledge graph construction, but rather from the retrieval and reasoning demands imposed by the benchmark."

            "title": "5.4 KG Construction Cost and Scalability",
            "content": "Since HybridRAG-Bench relies on automated KG construction, we briefly assess the efficiency and scalability of the underlying KG evolution pipeline. Empirically, both extraction latency and token usage grow approximately linearly with document length, consistent with the expected complexity dominated by LLM token processing and bounded merge operations. No superlinear cost growth is observed. In practice, KG construction can be parallelized across documents, substantially reducing end-to-end wall-clock time. Detailed latency and token scaling results are provided in Appendix A.1. The observed near-linear scaling is consistent with the theoretical complexity of the KG construction pipeline, which is dominated by HNSW-based entity and relation alignment with total complexity 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑁 + 𝑚 log 𝑀). Token Cost Analysis. Figure 2 presents token usage as function of document length during knowledge graph construction. As shown in the figure, token consumption increases approximately linearly with the size of the input corpus. This behavior arises from two primary factors: (1) input tokens scale proportionally with the raw text length, and (2) output tokens scale smoothly with the semantic density of each document. Because EvoKG performs Figure 2: Token usage during KG construction plotted against corpus length. Token cost grows approximately linearly with input size due to proportional input tokens and fixed number of extraction calls per document. The smooth scaling pattern confirms that EvoKGs update cost remains predictable and stable across document sizes. fixed and deterministic number of LLM extraction calls per document, the overall token footprint exhibits consistent slope rather than abrupt jumps or nonlinear spikes. This linear scaling pattern confirms that the computational cost of constructing the KG remains predictable and bounded. In practice, this ensures that EvoKG can support long-term or continuously updated corpora without unexpected surges in token usage, making the system practical for real-world deployments where cost control and scalability are critical."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "We presented HybridRAG-Bench, benchmark construction framework for evaluating retrieval-intensive reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench is designed to address long-standing challenges in evaluating LLM-based reasoning systems, particularly the difficulty of separating retrieval and reasoning from memorization when benchmarks overlap with model pretraining data. By constructing hybrid knowledge environments from recent scientific literature and generating questions grounded in explicit reasoning paths and supporting evidence, HybridRAG-Bench enables diagnostic evaluation of LLM-only, RAG-based, and hybrid KG-RAG methods. Our results show that the benchmark poses substantial challenges to LLM-only baselines and meaningfully distinguishes methods based on their ability to retrieve and integrate graph and textual information. While the framework relies on LLM-based components for knowledge extraction and question generation, and is currently instantiated using scientific literature, we view these choices as practical design decisions that enable scalable, contamination-aware evaluation rather than fundamental limitations. HybridRAG-Bench is intended as reusable research infrastructure, supporting flexible domain and temporal instantiation for future studies of retrieval, reasoning, and generalization over evolving knowledge.

            "content": "Theoretical Complexity Analysis. Let 𝑛 and 𝑚 denote the number of extracted entities and relations from corpus, and 𝑁 and 𝑀 denote the number of nodes and edges in the existing KG. KG extraction requires single LLM call with cost 𝑂 (𝑛 + 𝑚). Entity and relation alignment are performed using HNSW-based similarity search [30], with sublinear complexity 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑁 + 𝑚 log 𝑀). Subsequent merging and insertion operations involve lightweight attribute aggregation and incur linear cost 𝑂 (𝑛 + 𝑚). Overall, the total complexity of KG evolution is 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑁 + 𝑚 log 𝑀). In addition, the pipeline uses constant number of LLM calls per corpus (five in our implementation), making it practical for continuous and large-scale KG updates. Empirical Complexity Analysis. To assess the efficiency of KG construction, we measure the per-document extraction time across all corpora. Figure 3 plots the KG-update latency as function of document length (in characters). The results exhibit clear positive trend: longer documents incur proportional increases in processing time. This is expected, as extraction latency is dominated by the LLM forward pass, whose computational cost grows with input token count. We observe no evidence of superlinear blow-up. Instead, the empirical trend aligns with the theoretical 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑛 + 𝑚 log 𝑚) complexity of EvoKGs alignment and merge operations. Variance in the vertical direction is attributable to LLM-provider latency: extraction is executed via the OpenRouter API, whose backend routing introduces heterogeneity in response times that is unrelated to algorithmic complexity. Figure 3: Per-document KG construction latency as function of corpus length (in characters). Longer documents incur proportionally higher extraction time, and the trend follows the expected near-linear scaling dominated by LLM token processing. To clarify practical deployment: although Figure 3 reports perdocument latency, EvoKG supports data-parallel extraction.

Together, Figure 3 and 2 empirically validate the scalability of EvoKG and demonstrate that both latency and token cost grow smoothly and predictably with corpus size. A.2 Additional Per-Question-Type Results. To provide more complete view of benchmark behavior across models, we report detailed per-question-type performance for all evaluated LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen2.5-72B, LLaMA3.3-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B. For each model and baseline, we include accuracy grouped by question type along with standard deviation across 5 runs.
