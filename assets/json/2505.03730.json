            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Action transfer involves applying specific actions to target subject and is widely used in films, games, and animation. However, it often requires substantial financial and human resources. For example, professional motion capture systems can cost tens of thousands of dollars and require skilled technicians. Similarly, creating 30-second animation at 12 frames per second can take about 20 work days from six professional animators. These high costs pose significant challenges, limiting access for many potential creators. In response to these limitations, significant efforts have been devoted to achieving motion control in video generation, which can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: (1) Predefined signals methods using signals like pose and depth maps, such as AnymateAnyone [Hu 2024] and StableAnimator [Tu et al. 2024b], and (2) Global motion methods like Motion Director[Zhao et al. 2023] and Motion Inversion [Wang et al. 2024b]. Despite advancements, these methods exhibit notable limitations. Predefined signal methods require strict alignment of spatial structures (e.g., shape, skeleton, viewpoint) between the target image and reference video, which is often not feasible in real-world scenarios. They also struggle with obtaining pose information for non-human subjects. Conversely, global motion methods typically generate motions with fixed layouts and cannot transfer motion across diverse subjects. Some approaches [Zhao et al. 2023] employ identity-specific LowRank Adaptations (LoRAs) [Hu et al. 2021] for animation, yet they encounter difficulties with appearance consistency and flexibility. To this end, we introduce FlexiAct, an Image-to-Video (I2V) framework for flexible action customization in heterogeneous scenarios. Given reference video and an arbitrary target image, our method transfers actions from the reference video to the target image without alignment in layout, shape, or viewpoint, preserving both action dynamics and appearance details. FlexiAct builds upon CogVideoXI2V [Yang et al. 2024] with two-stage training on two novel components: RefAdapter and Frequency-aware Action Extraction (FAE), addressing the following challenges: (1) Spatial structure adaptation: Adapting actions to target images with different poses, layouts, or viewpoints. (2) Precise action extraction and control: Accurately decoupling and replicating action from the reference video. RefAdapter addresses the first challenge, which is an imageconditioned architecture generating videos given the input images. It combines the accuracy of I2V frameworks with the flexibility of conditional injection architectures like IP-Adapter [Ye et al. 2023a], ensuring appearance consistency between the video and the conditioning image while avoiding strict constraints on the first video frame. This enables FlexiAct to adapt reference motion to various spatial structures using arbitrary frames as image conditions. RefAdapter requires only low training costs, finetuning small set 2 of LoRA, avoiding the large parameter replication in ReferenceNet [Hu 2024] and ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023]. For precise action control, we propose Frequency-aware Action Extraction (FAE). This method incorporates set of learnable embeddings to capture entangled video information from the reference video during training. As illustrated in Figure 2, we observe that these embeddings dynamically adjust their attention to different frequency components across denoising timesteps. Specifically, they prioritize motion information (low-frequency features) in early timesteps and shift focus to appearance details (high-frequency features) in later timesteps. Leveraging this property, FAE performs action extraction directly during the denoising process by modulating attention weights at different timesteps, eliminating the need for separate spatial-temporal architectures. To validate the effectiveness of FlexiAct, we establish benchmark for heterogeneous scenarios. Experiments demonstrate FlexiActs flexible and general action transfer capabilities. As shown in Figure 1, FlexiAct accurately transfers action from reference video to subjects with varying layouts, viewpoints, shapes, and even domains, while maintaining appearance consistency. In summary, our paper makes the following key contributions: We propose FlexiAct, flexible action transfer method that first adapts reference actions to arbitrary subjects with diverse spatial structures while ensuring action and appearance consistency. We introduce RefAdapter, which achieves spatial structure adaptation and appearance consistency with few trainable parameters. We propose Frequency-aware Action Extraction, which precisely extracts action and controls the video synthesis during sampling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate FlexiActs capabilities across diverse scenarios, including various subjects and domains."

            "title": "2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Global Motion Customization",
            "content": "Global Motion Customization focuses on transferring the overall motion dynamics from reference video, such as camera movements, object trajectories, and actions, to generate videos with consistent global motion patterns [Jeong et al. 2024, 2023; Ling et al. 2024; Yatim et al. 2023; Zhao et al. 2023]. The challenge of this task lies in effectively extracting motion from the reference video. Recent work like Motion Director[Zhao et al. 2023] addresses this by adopting spatial-temporal LoRA[Hu et al. 2021] to decouple the appearance and the motion. Meanwhile, Diffusion Motion Transfer [Yatim et al. 2023] extracts motion via handcrafted loss during inference. On the other hand, Video Motion Customization [Jeong et al. 2023] encodes motion directly into the text-to-video model. Motion Inversion [Wang et al. 2024b] introduces two types of embeddings to decouple the appearance and motion. However, most of these methods fail to adapt motion to specific subjects, as they primarily focus on generating videos that approximate the layout of the reference video. In contrast, we propose framework that can handle the action transfer in heterogeneous scenarios. Furthermore, inspired by the insights into noise schedules from [Lin et al. 2024; Lu et al. 2024; Qiu et al. 2023; Si et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2023b] and our observations regarding different denoising timesteps, we propose the first denoising process-based action extraction framework.

            "title": "2.2 Predefined signal-based Action Customization",
            "content": "Action customization methods based on predefined signals, such as pose, depth, and edges, transfer motion from these signals to animate target images [Esser et al. 2023; He et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023d]. They focus on how to precisely control subjects with identical spatial structures using predefined signals. Early approaches [Huang et al. 2021; Siarohin et al. 2019, 2021] primarily utilized GANs [Goodfellow et al. 2020] for reference animation. Recent advancements have shifted to diffusion models, with Disco [Wang et al. 2024a] pioneering this transition for image animation. Subsequent works, such as MagicAnimate [Xu et al. 2024] and AnimateAnyone [Hu 2024], employ ReferenceNet and pose nets to decouple pose and appearance modeling. Further innovations include Champ [Zhu et al. 2024], which integrates 3D SMPL signals for enhanced controllability, and Unianimate [Wang et al. 2024c], which incorporates Mamba [Dao and Gu 2024] into diffusion models for improved efficiency. Additionally, MimicMotion [Zhang et al. 2024a] introduces regional loss to mitigate distortion, while ControlNeXt [Peng et al. 2024] replaces the computationally intensive ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023] with lightweight convolution-based pose net. However, these methods remain heavily reliant on predefined signals, limiting their effectiveness when the target image and reference video exhibit significant spatial discrepancies, such as variations in shape or pose. Moreover, they face challenges in non-human scenarios, where predefined motion signals are often unavailable or difficult to obtain. In contrast, our method does not rely on predefined signals with numerous constraints, enabling it to handle more general scenarios, such as transferring actions between subjects with different shapes, skeletons, viewpoints, and even across domains. 2.3 Customized Video Generation via Condition Injection With the advancement of text-to-video models [Bar-Tal et al. 2024; Blattmann et al. 2023; Brooks et al. 2024; Chen et al. 2023b, 2024; Esser et al. 2023; Guo et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2023c,b,a; Yang et al. 2024; Yuan et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024b; Zhou et al. 2024], customized video generation has emerged as critical and highly active research topic. Among these methods, some focus on injecting control signals into the video generation process through condition injection, which can generally be categorized into two types: one based on cross-attention injection, such as IP-Adapter[Ye et al. 2023b], and the other on module duplication for layer-wise injection, such as ReferenceNet[Hu 2024]. Cross-attention approaches, though lightweight, often fail to ensure appearance consistency due to coarse-grained representations (e.g., CLIP image features [Radford et al. 2021]). Module duplication enables finer control but incurs high training costs from parameter replication. In contrast, based on the I2V model, our RefAdapter strikes balance, achieving ReferenceNet-level fine-grained appearance control while requiring only small number of training parameters. Additionally, RefAdapter can reduce the strict first-frame dependency of I2V models. 3 METHOD 3.1 Overview As illustrated in Figure 3, FlexiAct builds upon CogVideoX-I2V with two-stage training on two components: RefAdapter and Frequency-aware Action Extraction (FAE). RefAdapter facilitates action adaptation to subjects with varying spatial structures while maintaining appearance consistency. FAE dynamically adjusts attention weights to frequency-aware embeddings at different denoising timesteps, enabling effective action extraction. These two components are trained separately to ensure that action extraction does not interfere with RefAdapters consistency preservation. Section 3.1 introduces FlexiActs base model. Section 3.3 introduces RefAdapter and its training methodology. Section 3.4 details the training and inference processes of FAE. Finally, Section 3.5 outlines the training and inference pipeline of FlexiAct. 3 SIGGRAPH Conference Papers 25, August 1014, 2025, Vancouver, BC, Canada Shiyi Zhang*, Junhao Zhuang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, and Yansong Tang Fig. 3. Overview of FlexiAct. (1) The upper part illustrates RefAdapters training, which conditions arbitrary frames to enable transitions across diverse spatial structures.

            "title": "3.2 Basis Image-to-Video Diffusion Model",
            "content": "𝑇 8 𝐶 4 𝐻 8 𝑊 We use CogVideoX-I2V [Yang et al. 2024] as our basis image-tovideo (I2V) model. CogVideoX-I2V is an MMDiT-based [Esser et al. 2024] video diffusion model that operates in latent space. Given an image R𝐻 𝑊 3 and textual prompt, CogVideoX-I2V generates video R𝑇 𝐻 𝑊 3. CogVideoX-I2V utilizes 3D VAE to map condition images and videos into the latent space. For video inputs, the 3D VAE encoder (𝜖 in Figure 3) compresses both temporal and spatial dimension, producing latent 𝐿𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜 , where 𝐶 denotes the channel number. For image inputs (𝑇 = 1), the encoder preserves the temporal dimension, yielding 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 R1 𝐻 8 𝐶 , which is then zero-padded along the temporal dimension to match 𝐿𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜 shape (1 𝑇 4 ). During inference, this padded 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 is concatenated with random noise along the channel dimension for subsequent denoising process. During training, the first frame of the ground truth video serves as the input image; its padded 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 is concatenated with the noisy 𝐿𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜 along the channel dimension to predict the added noise. This process is optimized with MSE loss between the added and predicted noise, consistent with classic diffusion models [Ho et al. 2020]. 3.3 RefAdapter 8 𝑊 8 𝑊 4 𝐻 8 𝐶 𝑇 The upper part of Figure 3 illustrates the RefAdapter training process. We note that directly using I2V for spatial structure adaptation is challenging because: (1) the action extraction process compromises the I2V models consistency preservation, and (2) I2V is strongly constrained image-conditioned framework. During training, I2V uses the first video frame as the condition image, ensuring video consistency but potentially hindering smooth action transfer if the initial spatial structure differs from the reference video. To address this, we introduce gap between the condition image and the initial spatial structure by using randomly sampled frame from the unedited video as the condition image during training. Specifically, we propose RefAdapter, which includes LoRA injected into CogVideoX-I2Vs MMDiT layers. RefAdapter is trained on 42,000 videos from [Ju et al. 2024] in 40,000-step one-time training. The training process of RefAdapter mostly follows CogVideoXI2V, with key distinctions: (1) The condition image is randomly selected from the entire untrimmed video instead of the first frame, maximizing spatial structure discrepancy. (2) We replace the first embedding along the temporal dimension of 𝐿𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜 with 𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 , enabling the model to use the first embedding as reference for guiding video generation, rather than constraining it as the videos starting point. Without this replacement, the generated videos initial state would remain constrained to match the condition image. 3.4 Frequency-aware Action Extraction To extract action information from reference video, straightforward approach involves training motion embeddings to fit motion information, akin to Genie [Bruce et al. 2024] or textual inversion [Gal et al. 2022]. However, our initial attempts with this method yield suboptimal results. Inspired by [Lin et al. 2024; Lu et al. 2024; Qiu et al. 2023; Si et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2023b], we delve into the relationship between the embeddings and action information during the denoising process. By examining the attention maps between motion embeddings and video tokens across different denoising timesteps, as visualized in Figure 2, we observe that our embeddings predominantly focus on low-frequency action information in the early stages, gradually shifting their attention to high-frequency details in the later stages. Leveraging this insight, we propose the Frequency-aware Action Extraction. FlexiAct: Towards Flexible Action Control in Heterogeneous Scenarios SIGGRAPH Conference Papers 25, August 1014, 2025, Vancouver, BC, Canada Specifically, the lower part of Figure 3 illustrates the training and inference process of FAE. We train Frequency-aware Embedding for individual reference videos, which includes learnable parameters concatenated to MMDiT layers inputs. This training differs from CogVideoX-I2V by applying random cropping on the input video to prevent the Frequency-aware Embedding from focusing on the reference videos layout. RefAdapter is not loaded during this training to protect its conditioning ability. After training, the Frequency-aware Embedding captures both motion and appearance from the reference video. During inference, FAE extracts action information and adapts it to the target image. As shown in Figure 2, attention maps between frequency-aware embeddings and video tokens reveal that at larger timesteps (e.g., step=800), the embeddings focus on motion information (low frequency), with high attention on the moving parts of the subject. At intermediate timesteps (e.g., step=500), the focus shifts to fine-grained details of the subject. At later timesteps (e.g., step=200), attention is distributed across the entire image, indicating focus on global details like the background. Based on this observation, during inference, we increase the attention weight of video tokens on the frequency-aware embeddings at larger timesteps while maintaining the original weights at other timesteps. This enhances the generated videos ability to perceive and replicate the motion of the reference video. The reweighting strategy of FAE can be formulated as: 𝑊𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 = 𝛼, 𝛼 2 0, (cid:20) cos (cid:18) 𝜋 𝑡ℎ 𝑡𝑙 (𝑥 𝑡𝑙 ) (cid:19) (cid:21) , + 1 𝑡𝑙 𝑡 𝑇 𝑡ℎ 𝑡 < 𝑡𝑙 (1) 0 𝑡 < 𝑡ℎ where 𝑊bias denotes the bias value applied to the original attention weight. 𝑡 denotes denoising timestep. The parameter 𝛼 controls the strength of the bias, while 𝑡𝑙 and 𝑡ℎ represent the low-frequency and high-frequency timesteps, respectively. transition function is employed between these timesteps to smoothly vary 𝑊bias from low-frequency to high-frequency timesteps. During inference, the attention weight of video tokens to the frequency-aware embedding is dynamically adjusted as 𝑊attn = 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑖 + 𝑊bias in all DiT layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the attention reweighting strategy improves the generated videos ability to reproduce the reference action. In practice, we set 𝛼 = 1, 𝑡ℎ = 700, and 𝑡𝑙 = 800, and demonstrate the impact of the transition function on the generation results in Figure 11. Without the transition function, changing the bias at 𝑡 = 700 would cause the model to learn appearance information from the reference video (e.g., the clothing in Figure 11) while altering the bias at 𝑡 = 800 would result in inaccurate motion. This indicates that transition process between 𝑡 = 700 and 𝑡 = 800 is necessary to achieve balance between appearance and motion."

            "content": "Evaluation Dataset. We conduct experiments on evaluation dataset of 250 video-image pairs, featuring 25 distinct action categories. Each action is transferred to 10 different target images, covering wide range of human motions (e.g., yoga, fitness exercises) and animal motions (e.g., jumping, running). The target images include real humans, animals, animated, and game characters. This diversity ensures our dataset encompasses broad spectrum of scenarios, allowing for comprehensive evaluation of our methods generalization capabilities. Comparison Methods. Existing methods for action transfer include those based on predefined signals and global motion. Predefined signal methods are ineffective for non-human entities or subjects with significant skeletal differences, as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, we use the recent global motion transfer method, MotionDirector [Tu et al. 2024a], as our baseline. For fair comparison, we reimplement MotionDirector on the stronger CogVideoX-I2V backbone (referred to as MD-I2V) with identical training settings to our methods. Additionally, we implement base model that learns actions directly through standard learnable action embeddings, without using RefAdapter and FAE (referred to as BaseModel). Training Details. For RefAdapters training, we conduct one-time 40,000-step training on Miradata [Ju et al. 2024] with learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 8 with the AdamW optimizer. RefAdapter introduces 66M parameters, constituting 5% of CogVideoX-I2Vs total parameters. Frequency-aware embeddings require 1,500 to 3,000 training steps on each reference video, depending on action complexity.

Notably, our Motion Fidelity scores are generally lower than those in global motion tasks, as they are affected by layout consistency, whereas global motion tasks involve transferring motion to scenarios with identical layouts, making them not directly comparable to action transfer in heterogeneous scenarios. 6 FlexiAct: Towards Flexible Action Control in Heterogeneous Scenarios SIGGRAPH Conference Papers 25, August 1014, 2025, Vancouver, BC, Canada Fig. 6.

Quantitative data show that removing FAE significantly decreases Motion Fidelity, highlighting its role in enhancing motion generation quality. This is corroborated by qualitative results, where two distinct actions transferred to different characters exhibit inconsistencies without FAE. For example, in stretching motion, the character merely raises their hand without proper bending or stretching, deviating from the reference video. Similar mismatches in the second example further emphasize FAEs importance for motion consistency. We also examined the impact of removing RefAdapter. Quantitative results indicate noticeable declines in both appearance consistency and motion fidelity, as RefAdapter ensures adaptability to varying spatial structures. Without it, the model struggles to adapt motion to target images with different spatial layouts, weakening appearance consistency. Qualitative results in Figure 6 support this: in the first example, discrepancies in the characters face and clothing are resolved with RefAdapter. In the second example, without RefAdapter, the output video fails to extend arms fully, maintaining them bent, and shows noticeable differences in facial details, underscoring RefAdapters role in maintaining both motion and appearance consistency."

            "content": "In this paper, we tackle the action transfer in heterogeneous scenarios, where the main difficulty is achieving precise action transfer for subjects with different spatial structures while maintaining appearance consistency. We introduce FlexiAct, flexible and versatile approach that surpasses existing methods. Our RefAdapter adapts to various spatial structures and ensures appearance consistency, while Frequency-aware Action Extraction allows for precisely extracting action during the denoising process. Extensive experiments show that FlexiAct effectively balances action accuracy and appearance consistency across diverse spatial structures and domains. Despite achieving precise action and appearance consistency, like [Jeong et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2024b; Yatim et al. 2023; Zhao et al. 2023], our method requires optimization for each reference video. Developing feed-forward motion transfer methods for heterogeneous scenarios is key direction for future work. Acknowledgments.
