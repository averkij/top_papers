            "content": "85 87 86 Materials science faces the primary challenges of integrating insights from an expanding body of literature and ultimately expediting the autonomous discovery of novel functional materials. To solve these problems, we need to combine knowledge from different types of data, different scales, and different experimental settings. Conventional uses of machine learning in materials science, such as the initial use of LLMs, have mostly followed static model: models are 90 trained on set of curated datasets to do specific tasks, like predicting properties or extracting 91 entities 13. Pre-trained LLMs excel at text understanding, efficiently mining chemical notation, experimental protocols, and technical jargon from unstructured text, thereby improving knowledge 93 extraction and hypothesis generation from the literature 4,5. Emerging multimodal frameworks that integrate textual, graph-based, and image data enrich molecular and materials representations for retrosynthesis planning, catalyst design, and structureproperty understanding across scales 68. Instruction-tuning or other post-training approaches further bridge the gap between 97 human intuition and machine execution by following complex, user-defined workflows in materials research; yet, they remain constrained when operating without closed-loop feedback and 99 long-horizon objectives. Consequently, progress toward autonomous discovery remains limited 100 not by lack of powerful models, but by the absence of an integrated framework that connects 101 these isolated capabilities to improved experimental outcomes. 102 96 88 95 92 98 106 105 103 This disconnection between static training proxies and dynamic utility reflects broader pathology in AI evaluation. According to METRs RE-Bench analysis 9, frontier models resorted 104 to sophisticated exploits, for example, monkey-patching the time function to spoof evaluation. Echoing the reward is enough hypothesis 10 in reinforcement learning (RL), which argues that maximizing suitably defined scalar reward can, in principle, drive the emergence of general 107 intelligence, we posit that carefully designed, end-to-end discovery reward, i.e., grounded in 108 the successful identification and validation of novel, useful materials, is in principle sufficient to 109 shape the entire AI4MatSci pipeline toward our ultimate scientific objective. It is not merely high 110 benchmark performance but the autonomous generation of novel and useful materials through 111 result-oriented, end-to-end system capable of robust inference, adaptive experimentation, and 112 In classical deep learning, end-to-end refers to the fact that single scalar safe deployment. loss defined at the final task output is back-propagated through all differentiable components of the model and feature stacks, enabling joint optimization of representation learning, intermedi115 ate modules, and prediction heads without manually engineered interfaces. Unfortunately, the 116 traditional reactive and phase-centric approach confines the models capability to operate to indi117 vidual stages of the entire workflow, making it difficult to adapt across dynamic, multi-modal, and 118 potentially lifelong workflows that are essential for achieving autonomous materials discovery. Furthermore, todays LLMs lack long-horizon reasoning and seamless integration of multi-scale, multimodal data streams, which are indispensable for driving an end-to-end materials discov121 ery pipeline in realistic settings. Our central thesis extends this notion of end-to-end beyond 122 single neural network to the full materials discovery pipeline in Fig. 1, treating pre-training, do123 main adaptation, tool use, experiment planning, and autonomous labs not as fixed stages but as 124 coupled, trainable components linked by credit assignment propagated directly from real-world 125 discovery outcomes. 126 Through the pipeline-centric lens, as shown in Fig. 1, this survey advocates shifting AI4MS 127 from static fine-tuning to goal-oriented agent workflows for materials discovery. The discussion 128 is structured around three guiding questions: Q1 (Evolution of Agency): How have general129 purpose machine learning models evolved from merely passive processors to agentic systems? 130 Q2 (Limitations of Phase-Centric Approaches) Why are existing AI for materials science sys131 tems not enough to meet the needs of autonomous materials discovery, even though they score 132 120 114 119 3 Figure 1: An overview of the key sections and an illustrative end-to-end pipeline encompasses foundation language models, domainkey elements like general pre-training tasks & data, specific tasks & data, materials-oriented model adaptation, goal-driven Large Language Model (LLM) agents, and iterative open-ended materials experimentation. The colored arrows show how feedback signals from open-ended experiments are routed to the agentic LLM, the materials science-tuned LLM, the pre-trained LLM, and their corresponding task modules. Different colors of arrows indicate the sources of the feedbacks. For example, if general-purpose pretraining data does not contribute positively to the ultimate goal of novel and useful materials discovery, adjustments should be made by revising the pre-training tasks and corpus or fine-tuning the pre-trained LLM accordingly to better align model knowledge with the ultimate objective of discovering novel materials. Dashed arrows denote the forward information flows. Note that humans are not only responsible for monitoring the open-ended experiments, but also co-improve with the agentic LLM."

            "content": "157 Machine Learning Foundations From the late 1990s through the early 2010s, most early 158 work in machine learning and AI was based on feature engineering, establishing the first batch 159 of data-driven tools for materials science. Over this period, these early methods were not just 160 used in materials research; they quickly became important instruments for finding new materials 161 and predicting their properties. 162 There are three main types of machine learning, which have been applied to materials science. Supervised learning techniques, such as support vector machines 18, random forests 19, and shallow neural networks 20, facilitated property prediction from labeled data, thereby creating quantitative structure-property relationships for expedited materials screening. Ward et al. 65 166 introduced general-purpose framework that combined chemically diverse feature set with 167 ensemble-based models like random forests. Their framework worked well on both crystalline 168 164 163 6 Supervised learning: e.g., Cortes and Vapnik 18, Breiman 19, Anderson 20, Deep Learning Revolution 2.1 Machine Learning Foundations 2.1 Unsupervised learning: e.g., McQueen 21, Khan et al. 22, Abdi and Williams 23, Maaten and Hinton Reinforcement learning: e.g., Sutton et al. 25, Mnih et al. 26, Schulman et al. 27, Garcia et al. 28, Konda and Tsitsiklis 29 Deep Learning 2.1 Architecture: e.g., Krizhevsky et al. 30, Goodfellow et al. 31, Kingma and Welling 32, Computation 33 Training: e.g., Srivastava et al. 34, Ioffe and Szegedy 35, Abadi et al. 36, Paszke et al. 37 Attention Revolution 2.2 e.g., Vaswani et al. 38, Devlin et al. 39, Brown et al.

Unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering (e.g., K-Means 21, DBSCAN 22) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA 23, t-SNE 24), aided materials 171 discovery by enabling pattern recognition, phase identification, and feature extraction from highdimensional data 66. Both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms enabled the initial requirements of the discovery cycle, i.e., correlating structures to properties. 170 172 173 To meet the need for autonomous materials discovery, RL techniques (e.g., Q-Learning 25, Deep Q-Networks (DQN) 26, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) 27, Model Predictive Control (MPC) 28, and ActorCritic methods 29) were introduced to interact with an environment and learn 177 from the consequences of their actions by optimizing reward functions over sequences of decisions. These methods make it possible to explore chemical space 67 and to search large design 179 spaces in more systematic way to identify materials with desirable properties 68. These models 180 work together to form an important foundation for the deep learning architectures that emerged 181 later. While these classical and early RL methods provided the foundational logic for data-driven 182 research, they lacked the representation learning capabilities required to process multi-modal experimental data. 175 183 178 184 Deep Learning The 2010s saw shift away from feature engineering and toward representation learning. The availability of large-scale datasets and increased computational resources 186 powered the development of deep learning 69,70. The 2012 ImageNet competition winner, AlexNet 30,187 helped establish deep learning as general-purpose machine learning tool for real-world prob188 lems. In materials workflows, this period matters less as milestone in AI history and more as 189 the point when learned representations started to replace manually designed descriptors 65,71. 190 This shift enabled scalable screening, surrogate modeling, and downstream decision-making in 191 materials discovery pipelines 72,73. 192 After discriminative models proved useful and matured, the focus shifted to generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 31 made inverse design possible by training generator and discriminator networks against each other. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) 32 had 195 efficient inference and learning in probabilistic generative models with continuous latent variables. 196 197 194 193 Recurrent architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 33 and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) 74 have made temporal modeling for reaction prediction, synthesis pathway optimiza199 tion, and materials degradation forecasting possible. Gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam 200 and SGD with momentum, together with regularization techniques like dropout 34 and batch normalization 35 improved training stability and reliability. Tools like TensorFlow 36 and PyTorch 37 played an important role in simplifying model development. Especially their support for multiGPU training further accelerated progress and made it feasible to work with large databases of materials 75. As datasets continued to expand and recurrent architectures struggled with longrange dependencies, the community has explored models better suited to handle global context. This shift has led to the rise of the attention-based Transformer era. 201 203 206 204 207"

            "content": "208 The Attention Revolution The self-attention mechanism 38 has reshaped sequence modeling 209 tasks since it was proposed in the Transformer framework. This made it possible to perform par210 allel computation and model long-range dependencies, which are important for understanding 211 chemical SMILES strings 76 and scientific literature. The multi-head attention 38 method enables 212 models to look at many representation subspaces simultaneously, capturing complex interactions across them. 213 214 8 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 39 introduced bidirectional pre-training with masked language modeling and next sentence prediction in late 2018. This 216 enabled models to capture the complex, context-dependent relationships that characterize scientific writing. GPT-3 40 demonstrated remarkable few-shot learning abilities with 175 billion parameters. Its performance suggested that scale, together with data, can give models surprising 219 flexibility, even without heavy fine-tuning. 217 215 218 220 Foundation Models and Scale-Up The term foundation models was first used in 41 to describe large models trained on variety of data, typically using self-supervision at scale, that can be applied to wide range of tasks. This is because attention-based architectures made 223 it possible for these models to be built. These models represent major shift in AI: their unprecedented size leads to new abilities in language, vision, reasoning, and human interaction, but they also increase the risks of homogenization, where flaws or biases in the foundation models spread to all adapted downstream systems. Task-specialized LLMs trained or adapted on 227 curated corpora (e.g., code 77,78, math 79,80, legal text 81) exemplify the dual nature of scaling: enhanced domain proficiency frequently accompanies hallucination 82 and challenges in calibration 229 and faithfulness 83, alongside difficulties in controllability and verifiability 84. 221 224 226 222 230 Field-specific foundation models have also emerged for scientific use. Domain-adapted scientific foundation models tailor general priors to expert corpora and evaluation regimes. SciBERT 42 modified BERT for scientific literature by training it on 1.14 million papers from Semantic 233 Scholar. By improving skills like named entity recognition, citation prediction, and relation extraction, it made biomedical and computer science texts easier to understand. AlphaFold 43 marked 235 major advance in predicting protein structures with attention mechanisms for evolutionary data 236 and physical constraints. This showed how transformers can be used for complex scientific problems, motivating analogous designs in other scientific domains (including materials science). 237 238 234 232 LLMs and Reasoning Capabilities Recent research has focused on reasoning, knowledge 239 grounding, and tool-enhanced inference in addition to scaling. Chain-of-thought prompting 44 adds the scientific reasoning that is essential for materials discovery. Memory-augmented architectures 45 support the retrieval of external knowledge, hence enhancing access to specialist materials science literature and databases during inference. Scaling laws 46 show that performance 243 improves when the number of parameters and data increases, following power-law relationships 244 up to the limits of the regime studied. This poses challenge for materials research because 245 high-quality datasets are far less abundant than in many other domains. 241 246 240 242 In response to data scarcity, the community has explored strategies including the use of synthetic data such as OC20 85, pre-training on large unlabeled materials databases such as 248 the Materials Project 86, and transfer learning from related scientific domains, including chemical datasets such as QM9 87. The inherent tension between data requirements and availability constrains applications of foundation models in materials discovery to subdomains with sufficient 251 training instances. The improvement in the reasoning ability of LLMs enhanced multiple fields in 252 materials science research 47, such as enhanced reasoning, which can help molecular structure 253 design 49 and materials design 48. 247 249 250 254 Multimodal Integration Cross-modal attention mechanisms have been used in multimodal foundation models 50,88 to integrate information from text, images, and structured data, which 256 is also useful for materials science, when workflows require fusing heterogeneous evidence 257 (e.g., literature, microscopy, and structure representations) into single decision context. Visionlanguage models (VLMs) like CLIP 51 and BLIP 52 use contrastive learning to enhance vision and 259 255 9 language representation alignment and thereby provide retrieval-ready joint embeddings that can be repurposed with limited supervision. This ability has enabled tasks such as zero-shot classification and text-image retrieval for the materials characterization study (e.g., rapid triage, annotation, and cross-referencing of characterization images with textual descriptors), but reliability typically depends on domain-specific calibration and evaluation. Flamingo 89, KOSMOS2 90, and VILA 91 are working on enhancing the video and 3D understanding abilities of the current multimodal framework, by extending multimodal context length and enabling richer imagetext interleaving; however, robust 3D understanding for scientific data streams remains an open gap 267 for end-to-end discovery settings. 262 266 261 263 268 265 264 In addition to general-purpose multimodal models, there are also specialized multimodal LLMs that have been adapted for materials science. These include MatterChat 53, MicroscopyGPT 54, MolVision 55, and PolyLLMem 92. These models combine atomic structure data, text, and 271 images to make it easier for people and AI to work jointly on tasks such as discovering new materials and predicting their properties. However, the impact on discovery depends on how well the system integrates aspects like tool use, uncertainty estimation, and closed-loop validation, not just the models ability in isolation. 272 274 273 275 270 Novel Architectures Beyond Transformers To address the computational efficiency bottleneck of Transformer-based architectures on long scientific sequences, several alternative architectures have been proposed. Structured State Space Models (S4) 56 addressed the limitations 278 of time-series materials data and molecular dynamics simulations by implementing parameterefficient architectures that facilitated training on exceptionally lengthy sequences (16K+ tokens). Mamba 57, selective state space model with input-dependent state transitions and linear com281 puting complexity, can reach Transformer-level quality on language-modeling benchmarks while 282 scaling more favorably with sequence length. This efficiency is particularly relevant when mod283 els must handle long molecular strings (e.g., SMILES or SELFIES for complex molecules and 284 polymers), simulation trajectories from molecular dynamics or density functional theory (DFT) 285 relaxations, lab notebooks accumulated over long experimental campaigns, or tool outputs as 286 part of an end-to-end discovery workflow. The next paradigm shift moves away from passively 287 reading text and toward reasoning and tool usage skills, leading to autonomous agents. 280 279 288"

In this 290 view, progress is driven not only by fitting static human-generated corpora, but also by iterative 291 interaction with environments that provide feedback signals. Now the systems-based LLM can 292 complete complex experimental tasks to be an agent rather than single network predictor. By 293 interacting with the environment/workflow, the agent can learn, improve, and adapt to real-world 294 tasks. 295 The AI field is currently transitioning from the Era of Human Data, where progress relies on 296 imitating finite, static datasets, to the Era of Experience, where agents achieve superhuman 297 capabilities by actively interacting with their environments and learning from the consequences 298 of their actions 93. The relevance of this shift to materials science is practical: the interactive 299 nature can steer the whole pipeline towards the ultimate goal of discovering novel and useful materials. 301 Just as general-purpose agents are now moving beyond human-privileged text interactions 302 to autonomous streams of experience, AI for materials science must evolve from passive models 303 trained on historical property databases to active AI Scientist 94 agents that engage in closed304 loop discovery. By treating experiments and simulations not merely as data sources but as 305 300 interactive environments, such agents can generate their own high-quality data through RL, potentially expanding exploration beyond human-selected candidates and accelerating iterative designtestlearn cycles. 306 307 308 309 Emerging Paradigms New paradigms, such as alignment and instruction tuning (e.g., Constitutional AI 95, RLHF 58), have improved instruction following and controllability and can reduce 310 hallucinations in practice, although factuality is not guaranteed and typically depends on grounding and verification, especially for scientific domains like materials science. These paradigms 312 are based on foundation models and can be viewed as post-training objective shaping on top 313 of pre-training. Few-shot 96 and zero-shot learning 51 have made it easier to adapt to tasks with 314 little data. This is important in fields where labeled datasets are limited by the high cost of experiments and the need for domain expertise. In-context learning 40,97 enables rapid prototyping 316 of new actions directly from stimuli, removing the need for task-specific fine-tuning. to improve scientific decision-making rather than just isolated perception, models are becoming 318 more skilled at tooland evidence-grounded reasoning across variety of modalities, such as images 98, crystal structures 99, spectroscopic data, and experimental measurements.

Later frameworks like Toolformer 60, AutoGPT 61, and LangChain 104 used these features 327 to add persistent memory, the ability to work with more than one tool at time, and the abil328 ity to plan recursively. These works demonstrate that agentic systems can address problems 329 necessitating extended procedures, although consistent long-term performance continues to be 330 influenced by tool reliability, feedback design, and safety constraints. 331 325 Recent Advances in Agents In the second half of 2025, wave of agents with thinking and 332 embodied action have emerged. Anthropics Claude Sonnet 62 is cognitive agent equipped with 333 enhanced reasoning, understanding, and tool-using abilities. This is step toward AI systems 334 that are better at using tools and sustaining multi-step analysis in real workflows. It also supports 335 more scientific use by helping users structure questions, integrate evidence, and connect ideas 336 across domains. Gemini Robotics 1.5 105 demonstrated transfer learning across different robotic 337 embodiments, advancing robotic agents beyond single-platform policies. Vision-language-action 338 (VLA) models highlight the value of explicit intermediate plans or reasoning steps that can improve action. NVIDIAs Cosmos reasoning model 106 improves agent reasoning by integrating 340 physical priors and common sense constraints into robotic decision-making. Microsofts autonomous agents 63 demonstrate that AI agents have great potential to orchestrate complex, multi-step tasks on behalf of users. 343 Through the above improvements, multiple agents with different skills can collaborate to build 344 339 341 agent ecosystems capable of completing complex tasks. Recent systems demonstrate that AI can function as powerful research partner, able to read literature, generate hypotheses, plan experiments, and design syntheses, rather than just making predictions 107. Such agents 347 can retrieve external resources, call specialized tools, and coordinate downstream actions autonomously 61,108. 348 349 346 Integrating data-driven analysis, such as extracting useful information from large-scale sci350 entific literature, with formulating hypotheses and organizing experiments can be supported by 351 11 LLM-based agents. Such capabilities are discussed in detail in 64. These features make it much 352 easier to sort data for tasks that only apply to certain area. 353 However, end-to-end materials discovery is still limited by reliable grounding, constraintaware reasoning such as stability and synthesizability, and closed-loop validation with simulations and experiments. Agents can also enable more independent, agent-driven research 356 pipelines that may accelerate discoveries by emphasizing system-level integration (feedback, coordination, and objective alignment) rather than isolated model capabilities. 357 355"

            "content": "359 Figure 4: The gradual integration of general AI into the materials science workflow. This framework illustrates the progressive evolution of broad, pre-trained foundation models as they are adapted for scientific discovery. Rather than sudden replacement, the diagram depicts how general capabilities are iteratively refined through domain adaptation and feedback loops, allowing general-purpose AI to be gradually and effectively applied to specialized materials challenges. After addressing Q1, we discuss the interaction between the pre-trained LLMs and the agen360 tic LLMs, as shown in Fig. 4, from the end-to-end pipeline-centric perspective, explicitly treating 361 the pre-training stage as controllable module whose data, objectives, and safety constraints 362 can be continuously revised in light of downstream discovery performance rather than as 363 one-off static initialization. This framing makes pre-training an object of system designsubject to iterative revisionrather than fixed prerequisite that is optimized once and then taken for granted. 366 It is generally believed that general pre-training corpora on which contemporary LLMs are 367 364 trained are essential to the downstream fine-tuned models; however, recent studies (e.g., 109) 368 suggest that such broad pre-training may not always be necessary and, in some cases, may 369 even be suboptimal for specialized scientific applications. Furthermore, reliance on indiscriminately scraped web-scale corpora increases the chance of poisoning attacks and incidental misinformation, which can induce harmful or misleading behaviors even when benchmarks appear unaffected 110. Instead, if the ultimate objective of discovering novel materials is what we value 373 most, we should review the techniques presented before and enforce that every upstream design 374 choiceincluding corpus selection, pre-training objectives, and alignment proceduresis justified by its contribution to this end goal rather than by improvements on proxy language bench371 372 370 375 12 marks. More concretely, better pre-training should be defined by downstream discovery-relevant behaviors (e.g., planning feasible syntheses and correctly handling hazards), not by generic 378 language metrics alone. Continuing the presentations in Sec. 2.2, we should require that these 379 architectures benefit the discovery of novel materials and not just improve the pre-training scores 380 on generic benchmarks, recognizing that even small fractions of poisoned or misaligned data can 381 strongly bias downstream scientific behavior. 377 382 383 To make this pipeline-centric stance operational, the pre-training stage must be embedded within feedback loop in which agentic systems operating over simulations and experiments supply long-horizon reward signals that can, in principle, be propagated back to earlier stages to revise corpus composition, sampling strategies, and alignment objectives whenever inherited behaviors of general-purpose LLM systematically hinder materials discovery. This suggests moving from frozen pre-training corpus toward an adaptive, feedback-driven 388 pre-training loop where materials-science outcomes and safety considerations jointly determine 389 which segments of the original web-scale data are amplified, attenuated, or removed, and where 390 domain-specific corpora are dynamically expanded in response to identified capability gaps 391 along the designsynthesisvalidation pipeline. Recent progress in LLM-based agent architectures and tooling, as discussed in Sec. 2.3, makes such pipeline-centric perspective increasingly feasible, allowing the successful discovery of novel, experimentally validated materials to 394 serve as the primary reward signal guiding the entire system rather than surrogate benchmarks 395 alone. Crucially, this closes the evaluation loop: it ties what we optimize (training choices) to 396 what we ultimately value (validated discovery). 392 384 386 385 393 397 Influence functions 111,112 offer one concrete mechanism for such backward credit assignment 398 by estimating how infinitesimal upweighting or downweighting of individual training examples 399 would perturb models parameters and downstream predictions. Approximate influence estimators 111 based on scalable inverse-Hessian approximations have been demonstrated on large 401 LLMs, recovering sparse, interpretable sets of pre-training sequences that are most responsible 402 for particular emergent behaviors. From pipeline-centric perspective, these tools can be repurposed to identify which general-domain documents and which MatSci-specific corpora most strongly support or undermine key capabilities needed for discovery (e.g., robust reasoning over 405 phase diagrams, synthesis planning under realistic process constraints, or safety-critical hazard 406 identification), thereby informing which data sources to emphasize, de-emphasize, or excise in 407 subsequent rounds of pre-training. This turns data selection into goal-driven hyperparameter, rather than one-time curation decision. 404 408 403 409 410 Analogously, an AI4MatSci pipeline could employ influence scores computed on discoveryrelevant behaviors, e.g., successful identification of synthesizable candidates, safe handling of hazardous chemistries, or robust performance in long-horizon design loops. It can upweight 412 beneficial segments of both general and MatSci-specific data, while downweighting or removing 413 sequences that systematically induce hallucinated mechanisms or impossible synthesis conditions. In this view, pre-training, domain adaptation, and instruction tuning collectively form sin415 gle, influence-addressable memory that is continuously reshaped by reward signals originating 416 from agentic closed loops in simulation and experiments, rather than being optimized only once 417 against proxy language benchmarks that may fail to reveal poisoning or subtle misalignment. In 418 this sense, influence functions become not only interpretability tools but also prospective levers 419 for dynamically re-aligning the pre-training component with the ultimate materials-science objec420 tive of discovering novel, useful, and safe materials, while mitigating security risks introduced by 421 open-world data collection. At the same time, these general-purpose agents must be carefully 422 tailored to materials science to align with real workflows, safety regulations, and experimental constraints, refinement that will be developed in the next section. 411 423"

Figure 6: Taxonomy of reactive tasks in materials science from an AI perspective, Part 2. 469 The performance of machine learning models critically depends on their input representations. This challenge was acutely evident in early models for periodic solids, which had difficulty 470 formulating representations that were invariant to arbitrary choices of coordinate systems or unit cells while guaranteeing uniqueness 205. Early approaches adapted representations from molecular machine learning (e.g., the Coulomb matrix) to periodic systems by incorporating Ewald 473 sums or considering neighboring unit cells 118. paradigm shift was subsequently established 474 by GNNs through representing crystals as graphs with atoms and bonds as nodes and edges, which allows models to learn from the local atomic environment through message-passing 71. More recently, Transformer-based architectures have built upon this graph-based foundation by 477 processing materials as sequences of tokenswhether atoms, sites, or textual descriptionsa 478 strategy that, by focusing on global context, more effectively captures long-range interactions and 479 symmetries than the locally oriented GNNs leading to improved modeling performance 206. However, improved representations alone do not resolve long-horizon planning, feedback coupling, or decision-level constraints that arise when predictors are embedded in closed-loop discovery 482 workflows. 471 475 472 476 480 483 In current benchmark-driven screening workflows, much emphasis has 484 Electronic Properties been placed on the prediction of fundamental electronic properties, especially the bandgap and 485 conductivity for the screening of semiconductors and functional materials 207. This focus is partly 486 pragmatic: these targets are widely used as first-pass filters, but they can also over-represent 487 what is easiest to score on proxy benchmarks. Recent works based on Transformers have shown 488 superior capability in capturing global crystal characteristics compared to previous successes 489 of GNNs at capturing localized atomic environments 113. The CrystalTransformer model embodies this advance by feeding in crystal structure information through Transformer encoder; specifically, this work starts with concatenation of chemical and structural feature matrices, In the encoder, and then processes the combined representation into Transformer encoder. 493 the multi-head self-attention identifies complex, long-range correlations between all atoms in 494 manner that is agnostic to their spatial proximity, enabling the model to learn highly context-aware 495 atomic embeddings 114. Other variants, such as MatInFormer, have generalized this paradigm by 496 learning the grammar of crystallography through the tokenization of space group information 497 and subsequently demonstrating the adaptability of this architecture for property prediction on 498 range of datasets 115. Increasingly, key factor is the strategic use of linguistic input. For example, if natural language descriptions of crystalline solid are used, then high-accuracy pre500 dictions of properties such as bandgap can be achieved, which seems not possible for some 501 GNNs due to an inability to capture certain nuanced, global structural details such as space 502 group symmetry and Wyckoff positions 208. The success of Transformer-based architectures in 503 the processing of both symbolic structural information and text suggests that they operate as 504 superior contextual encoders rather than purely topological encoders 209. This allows them to im505 plicitly integrate learned chemical and structural knowledge, avoiding the limitations of localized 506 message-passing schemes. 490 491 492 507 The prediction of mechanical properties such as bulk modulus and 508 Mechanical Properties shear modulus is important in materials design with targeted strength, durability, and resilience 210,211.509 Various machine learning models have been widely adopted for predicting such mechanical 510 properties, greatly reducing their dependence on simulation methods that are computationally 511 intensive 116. More recently, domain-specific LLMs for materials science can be specialized in 512 the predictions of complex mechanical properties, often by leveraging text-derived representations or hybrid text+structured inputs. For example, ElaTBot is an LLM for the prediction of the full elastic constant tensor from text inputs 117. Hence, the elastic tensor can be predicted 515 513 17 simultaneously with the determination of properties such as bulk modulus at any finite temperature. Moreover, by incorporating general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4o and using the RetrievalAugmented Generation technique, its prediction accuracy can be boosted, indicating again the 518 power of combining domain-specific knowledge with the broad reasoning capabilities of generalist models when retrieval sources are curated and verifiable 212. This significantly accelerates the 520 prediction process but, more importantly, can support early-stage inverse design by proposing 521 candidate compositions with targeted elastic propertiessubject to the fidelity of the predictive 522 surrogate and downstream verification. 519 516 523 Among the most basic and important thermodynamic properties 524 Thermodynamic Stability is the formation energy, which dictates stability for crystalline solid 213. Its prediction is thus of paramount importance in order for high-throughput screening to be performed on new, synthesizable materials. Machine learning models have thus been employed to directly predict it from 527 crystal structures, with the key ingredient being sophisticated feature engineering to account for periodicity in solids 118. Subsequent deep learning models demonstrated the feasibility of material property inference from merely elemental composition and symmetry classification 119. 526 530 525 529 particularly noticeable development in this domain has been the development of structureagnostic models, which predict properties from stoichiometry alone. Using message-passing 532 architecture on dense weighted graph representation of the chemical formula, the Roost framework learns material descriptors in an explicit-structure-free way 214. This is especially important in the early stage of materials discovery when little to no crystal structural information is known. Self-supervised pre-training methods have been shown to boost the performances of such models even further, with substantial improvements in the low-data regime 215. Furthermore, LLMs 537 have been demonstrated to handle simple chemical formulas and predict complex chemical 538 properties (e.g., formation energy), significantly reducing the computational cost of materials 539 screening. 534 535 540 531 533 Thermoelectric and Thermal Properties Thermoelectric materials enable the conversion be541 tween thermal and electrical energy, making them crucial for waste heat recovery and solid-state 542 cooling technologies. However, the lack of large, structured datasets with relevant performance 543 metrics hinders the development of models for high-performance thermoelectric materials 216. LLM-based extraction approaches are increasingly used to mitigate this data bottleneck. Recent 545 work has shown that agentic, LLM-driven workflows autonomously extract the thermoelectric 546 and structural properties from thousands of scientific articles 120. These intelligent agents can 547 parse text, tables, and captions to create large machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural information such as the crystal class and space group 121. This 549 automated curation pipeline can improve downstream regression by expanding training data and 550 improving schema consistency; however, it still primarily optimizes proxy prediction objectives 551 unless coupled to closed-loop validation and decision-making in the discovery loop."

Meanwhile, because LLMs can effectively handle noisy experimental and computational materials data and integrate data inputs from multiple modalities such as text, images, and numerical data 16,218, they are gradually becoming general solution for classification problems. 557 558 560 18 Defect Classification and Experimental Automation The classification of defectswhether vacancies, dislocations, or grain boundariesis an important aspect of predicting materials performance and ensuring safety and optimization of manufacturing yield. In practice, defect signals 563 may be derived from microscopy 219, in-situ sensors 220, or the operational setting ranges from offline labeling to on-the-fly process monitoring 221. LLM has broad application prospects in this 565 field, serving both static analysis tasks such as defect labeling and integration into closed-loop 566 systems to provide real-time decision support for researchers, thereby accelerating research and 567 development cycles 122,123. At present, most deployments still treat classification as modular, reactive component; closed-loop autonomy typically requires additional planning, control, and 569 verification modules beyond classification alone. 568 561 562 570 571 In additive manufacturing, LLMs fine-tuned on process parameter data can predict defect regimes (i.e. keyholing or lack of fusion) directly from natural language descriptions 222. This 572 enables faster build parameter optimization while significantly reducing reliance on resourceintensive simulations and physical experiments. Similarly, in materials characterization, conversational LLM systems have been developed to support defect classification from Atomic Force 575 Microscopy (AFM) images. These typically involve two-step pipeline whereby vision-based 576 model performs an initial defect classification, and then an LLM acts as conversational assistant. In this latter role, the LLM contextualizes the classification based on queries from users 578 and experimental parameters and provides actionable feedback in natural language, such as 579 suggesting adjustments of scan speed to minimize artifacts 223. More broadly, classification becomes substantially more valuable when embedded in an interactive workflow, but the classifi581 cation objective itself remains proxy label unless the surrounding system optimizes end-to-end 582 discovery outcomes 224. This evolution transforms the LLM from passive classifier into an active 583 participant in the experimental workflow-capable of hierarchical reasoning linking sensor input to 584 corrective measures with reduced reliance on continuous expert supervision 16. Finally, beyond 585 classification, LLM-driven agents are being developed that automate the complete scientific discovery process, from hypothesis generation 225 to experimental design and data analysis 123. 587 586 573 577 580 3.1.3 Advanced Methodologies To pursue more robust and generalizable LLMs for materials science, the adoption of deep learning methods has shaped both model architectures and training strategies. 589 590 Hybrid GNN-Transformer Architectures While GNNs perform well in modeling local atomic 591 environments, their main drawbacks are related to modeling long-range interactions and wellknown issue of over-smoothing in deep architectures 226. Transformers specialize in the opposite: global dependencies with high computational costs for large structures 227. Hybrid GNNTransformer architectures seek to harness the strengths of both approaches 228. 595 These hybrid models generally use GNN to learn efficiently local structural features from 596 593 594 predefined graphs. The node embeddings produced by this step encode structure-aware information and are treated as sequence of tokens by Transformer module. This latter component then uses self-attention to infer long-range interactions within the material 124. The hierarchical method therefore overcomes the individual limitations of both architectures by leveraging their combined strengths to afford even more accurate and scalable predictions of material properties 125,229. This synergy thus allows for rich representation of materials from the atomic to 602 the macroscopic scale. However, stronger representations alone do not guarantee improved 603 out-of-distribution reliability, motivating uncertainty-aware evaluation and closed-loop validation. 599 604 601 597 598 19 Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for Generalization The physical interdependencies between key 605 material properties (such as band gap, elastic modulus, and formation energy) make MTL 606 very suitable strategy for building generalizable models 230. By training single model on these 607 related tasks simultaneously, MTL seeks to discover unified feature space that inherently encodes the underlying shared representations consistent with physical correlations, resulting in 609 more robust and generalizable representation and leading to better prediction performance 126. practical limitation is negative transfer: performance can degrade when tasks conflict or when 611 task data are imbalanced and heterogeneous, as is common in materials datasets 231. 612 610 Architectures such as the Multi-Task Pre-trained Transformer Encoder (MTENCODER) learn 613 general material representations from diverse properties 127. By combining the signals from several auxiliary activities, this method makes data more efficient and helps the models generalize 615 better to new tasks and materials. Thus, using MTL in transformer encoders creates strong 616 and transferable embeddings that are an important step toward flexible foundation models for materials science 232. From pipeline-centric perspective, MTL performs internal credit sharing 618 across proxy tasks; aligning task selection and weighting with discovery-level objectives remains 619 an open systems challenge 233. 617 620 Uncertainty Quantification for Trustworthy AI To make AI-driven materials discovery effective, we need system capable of accurately measuring prediction uncertainty. This measurement of uncertainty is very important for building trust in AI systems, directing active learning 623 strategies, and reliably finding samples that are outside of the distribution 128. 624 622 621 625 In closed-loop discovery, uncertainty is also decision variable (e.g., acquisition or stopping). There are two main kinds of uncertainty quantification methods: aleatoric uncertainty, which comes from noise in the data, and epistemic uncertainty, arising from limited data coverage and model misspecification 234. There are different ways to figure out prediction intervals 628 for material properties. Some of these are probabilistic methods like Gaussian processes, while 629 others are quantile loss functions and methods that directly model prediction error 128. Having 630 good estimates of epistemic uncertainty is very helpful because they show parts of chemical 631 space where the model is not very certain. This directly benefits targeted data collection, which 632 means that future experiments or simulations could be guided by an active learning loop. This 633 makes the process of discovering new findings faster and uses fewer resources 235. In materials 634 settings, uncertainty estimation is further complicated by multi-fidelity data (simulation vs. ex635 periment), distribution shift across conditions, and the compositional long tailprecisely where 636 naıve confidence estimates can fail. More and more studies are now trying to determine how 637 much uncertainty there is in the outputs of LLMs. This is necessary step for using them reliably 638 in important scientific work 236. Finally, while uncertainty quantification can make proxy-task pre639 dictors more reliable, end-to-end discovery requires propagating uncertainty through multi-step 640 planning and experimentation decisions."

            "content": "642 643 Information extraction in materials science focuses on converting experimental descriptions and 644 performance data from publications into structured formats suitable for data-driven research. 645 As pipeline-critical bottleneck, extraction determines what becomes trainable downstream 646 (datasets, benchmarks, and ultimately the objectives that models optimize). Early works used 647 rule-based text mining systems such as ChemDataExtractor 237, which automatically produced 648 databases of synthesis parameters 129, battery compositions 130, thermoelectric properties 131, 649 20 and mechanical data 132 from journal article. These approaches provided reproducible extraction pipelines but were constrained by fixed grammars and limited adaptability to variations in 651 scientific writing. 652 650 To address these limitations, subsequent research introduced statistical and representationlearning approaches. Embedding models trained on large-scale materials corpora captured 654 latent chemical and physical relations through co-occurrence patterns 203, while domain-specific 655 advances in named entity recognition and normalization improved terminology consistency 238. Building on these foundations, transformer-based models such as MatSciBERT 178 and MechBERT 239 provided contextualized embeddings that greatly improved extraction robustness and 658 accuracy across diverse publication sources. 659 657 653 Research on LLMs for materials science, utilizing prompt engineering and fine-tuning, has 660 661 expanded the limits of extraction system. ChatExtract 240 builds conversational system with engineered prompts and follow-up questions to identify evidence sentences, extract structured values, and self-verify, reaching high precision and recall suitable for database curation. Similarly, MaTableGPT 241, an instruction-tuned and table-aware model, jointly reasons over narrative text and tabular data for quantitative extraction. da Silva et al. 242 presented an automated pipeline 665 for extracting synthesis procedures for reticular materials from PDFs using prompt-based paragraph classification. Wang et al. 243 also explored LLM-augmented decision programs that link 667 extracted synthesis data to design workflows. At the same time, others combine extraction 668 and verification mechanisms to autonomously construct structural datasets from full-text literature 120,218,244. Further, Ansari and Moosavi 245 developed chemist AI agent that extracts and 670 structures materials science data with chain-of-verification tool to create datasets. Collectively, these efforts suggest shift from one-shot parsing toward agentic extraction pipelines, and yet extraction still functions largely as reactive module unless it is coupled to discovery-level objectives and outcome-grounded evaluation. 673 672 671 663 666 664 674 3.2.2 Knowledge Graph 675 As extraction quality improved, researchers began to integrate extracted entities and relations 676 into structured knowledge representations. Hybrid and semi-supervised methods complement purely model-based extraction by building structured knowledge representations. Hybrid meth678 ods combine GNNs, structured ontology models and LLMs to extend knowledge graphs and 679 interpret predicted relations 246. Semi-supervised pipelines have been applied to identify synthesisprocessingproperty relations in alloy systems 133. Machine learning combined with text mining has enabled the reconstruction of magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams from literature 134. These extracted relations feed into knowledge graphs such as MatKG and terminologybased networks 135,136, which integrate entities, parameters, and outcomes into structured rep684 resentation for downstream reasoning across the compositionstructureproperty space. Prein 685 et al. 247 proposed ranking-based approach to inorganic synthesis planning that learns precursor relationships in latent space, providing new insights for reaction network construction. 687 key limitation is that KG coverage and correctness remain bounded by extraction noise and 688 ontology choices, and thus errors could propagate into downstream reasoning and planning 248. 680 682 683 689"

LLMs, in particular, can be employed for designing novel materials and synthesis methods, expanding materials 706 R&D beyond data analysis into proactive innovation. Key tasks include structure generation, inverse design targeting desired properties, and synthesis route generation. 705 707 708 3.3.1 Structure Generation 709 The task of structure generation in AI4Materials spans multiple scales and materials classes, aiming to propose new candidate structures that are valid, stable, and potentially synthesizable 252. In practice, these criteria are often operationalized using surrogates (e.g., predicted for712 mation energy), which can diverge from real synthesis feasibilitymotivating the pipeline-centric 713 emphasis on verification and closed-loop feedback. While early research focused on crystalline 714 solidswhere periodicity, symmetry, and lattice constraints dominatethe field now extends 715 to polymers, porous frameworks (MOFs 253/COFs 254), amorphous phases such as glasses and 716 In these 717 electrolytes, microstructures at the mesoscale, and even architected metamaterials. fields, materials can be represented as matrices, voxels, or graphs, and generative models 255 718 are used to generate realistic atomic structures. For discovery, the key differentiators are less 719 the model family than whether generation is coupled to evaluation in the loop. 720 For crystalline materials, complementary research approach has emerged that represents 721 711 710 crystal structures as text sequences and generates them using language models. This language722 based paradigm treats structural information as sequence of tokens, which makes it possible 723 to generate lattices and compositions in an autoregressive manner. Following this idea, CrystalLLM 140 further highlighted the potential of sequential generation by applying autoregressive 725 language modeling to produce CIF file sequences directly. Gruver et al. 141 further demonstrated 726 that fine-tuned LLaMA-2 models can directly generate stable inorganic crystal structures purely 727 as text, while achieving nearly double the generation speed that of diffusion-based baselines (i.e. CDVAE 256). More recently, MATLLMSEARCH 142 showed that pre-trained LLMs can act as agen729 tic generators of crystal structures without additional fine-tuning. Their system autonomously 730 explores and optimizes materials by combining pre-trained LLaMA-3.1 model with evolutionary 731 search and physical evaluation. This shows shift in regarding LLMs as reasoning agents that 732 can iteratively search, evaluate, and improve candidate structures. Collectively, these works 733 mark transition from generative sampling to search-with-verification, which is loser to our pipeline-centric view. Unfortunately, most evaluations still rely primarily on simulated or surrogate validators. 724 728 736 734 735 3.3.2 Inverse Design 737 738 740 739 In materials generation using generative models, the objective is typically to produce new materials that follow the distribution of the training data. However, in practical materials discovery, there is often demand to identify materials that exhibit specific desired properties. MatAgent 143, proposes an agentic materials generation framework combining an LLM, diffusion model, and 741 property prediction model. In this framework, the LLM proposes candidate compositions and 742 iteratively refines them based on feedback from the property predictor, enabling the autonomous 743 generation of materials with desired properties. RL has also entered this space: to inverse 744 inorganic oxide materials design to target promising compounds using specified property and 745 synthesis objectives 144. Because RL naturally supports long-horizon objectives, careful reward 746 and constraint design is essential to avoid optimizing proxy signals that do not translate to real discovery outcomes. Deep dreaming solves the inverse design challenge for metalorganic 748 frameworks by directly optimizing string-based representations of MOF linkers within unified 749 neural network to generate novel, synthesizable structures with targeted properties 145. MatDesINNe is framework based on invertible neural networks (INNs) that learns both forward 751 and reverse mappings between design parameters and target properties, enabling generation of candidate materials for specified property goals (e.g., band gaps in 2D materials) 146. PolyTAO (Transformer-Assisted Oriented model) is generative pre-trained model for polymers: given vector of target polymer properties, it generates polymer repeat unit SMILES with very 755 high chemical validity and accurately matches desired property values in semi-template or even 756 template-free settings 257. These approaches share common dependency on surrogate prop757 erty models and feasibility constraints, motivating closed-loop verification later in the discovery 758 pipeline. 759 752 747 754 750 3.3.3 Synthesis Route Generation 760 761 762 763 Synthesis route generation refers to constructing feasible pathways to synthesize target material. In materials science, it covers various aspects, such as choosing suitable precursors, suggesting reaction paths, and making predictions about key reaction conditions like time, temperature, and reaction environment 258. In practice, synthesis is often the dominant bottleneck: 764 feasibility and process constraints are what separate generated candidates from experimentally 765 validated materials. Graph-based methodologies were first applied to depict solid-state processes and employed pathfinding to ascertain viable synthesis pathways 147. Researchers have 767 also used machine learning to directly predict experimental conditions from data in the literature. This has shown links between the stability of precursors and the temperatures or periods of synthesis 148. In addition to reactions, models can suggest sets of precursors based on how similar the materials are, which makes recipes for inorganic synthesis more accurate 149. At the sys771 tem level, autonomous laboratories are already combining AI planning with robotics and active 772 learning. For example, A-Lab can design, run, and refine synthesis strategies for new inorganic 773 compounds iteratively again 259. What makes such platforms non-reactive is closed-loop execu774 tion, where synthesis outcomes update models and trigger replanning, rather than ending at 775 one-shot proposal. 776 Synthesis planning is complex task requiring the collaborative optimization of advanced 777 algorithms such as deep learning, RL, and uncertainty-aware search 260. The aforementioned 778 approaches reveal that synthesis planning is evolving toward data-driven closed-loop system. 779 The systems must not only generate synthesis paths tailored to specific requirements but also 780 perform real-time updates based on synthesis outcomes 261. These loops can supply discoverylevel feedback signals that support end-to-end credit assignment across upstream components. 769 768 766 770"

By mapping the conductivity-temperature trade-off, the AI model identifies the optimal low-temperature, high-conductivity formulations, which were later successfully validated in scalable manufacturing process. Later, Chitturi et al. 151 demonstrated an 790 autonomous material search platform by developing multi-property version of Bayesian algorithm execution (BAX), which transforms the user-defined targets into acquisition functions to 792 guide the autonomous targeted materials discovery. Reported evaluations emphasize efficiency 793 in locating target materials; for discovery-oriented settings, these should be interpreted through 794 outcome-level metrics (e.g., experimental sample efficiency), not benchmark-style scores alone.

This becomes more challenging for an end-to-end 873 25 agentic LLM for materials science, especially considering the costs associated with evaluating 874 the outputs in the real-world, never-ending experimental environment. 875 3.5.1 Data scarcity and heterogeneity 876 The advancement of data-driven materials science is characterized by the collaborative endeavors of all stakeholders to address the challenges of data scarcity and data heterogeneity 279,280. To solve this problem, systems like MatMiner 281 and Robocrystallographer 282 give us the tools 879 we need to turn different types of materials into standardized numerical descriptors that ML can 880 use. MatMiner has full library of features that cover wide range of attributes. Robocrystallographer, on the other hand, is made to create interpretable features from crystallographic 882 data. 877 883 881 OPTIMADE 283 provides unified API enabling researchers to query diverse materials databases884 simultaneously, thereby partially addressing data heterogeneity issues. Ghiringhelli et al. 284 proposes hierarchical metadata approach,FAIR, which stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, advocating for unified and streamlined philosophy for computational and 887 experimental data management. 885 886 888 The LeMatTraj project 285 directly solves the problem of not having enough data by combining nearly 120 million high-quality atomic configurations from the primary repository into 890 single dataset. This is in addition to the infrastructure standards. This huge collection has the 891 high-quality, standardized data that is needed to develop strong machine learning interatomic 892 potentials. 889 893 897 895 Data Augmentation Data augmentation techniques are crucial for mitigating data scarcity 894 and heterogeneity in materials modeling, evolving from basic perturbation strategies to complex physics-informed generative methods. Early studies, such as OC20 159, supplemented DFT 896 datasets through random structural perturbations, short-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, and electronic structure analysis. It then slowly changed into physics-informed augmentation strategies: Szymanski et al. 160 included experimental errors (lattice strain, crystal texture) in the XRD pattern generation process, thus linking simulations to experiments. Gibson et al. 161 900 proposed physically motivated, computationally cheap perturbation technique that augments 901 training data to improve the accuracy of unrelaxed structure prediction by 66% and directly ad902 dressing the domain mismatch problem in crystal structure prediction. Based on this idea, Dinic 903 et al. 286 presented an ML model capable of predicting the crystal energy response to global strain 904 by using available elasticity data to augment the dataset, which greatly improved energy forecasts for structures that were not perfectly straight. In addition to physics-motivated methods, generative techniques that produce high-quality in-silico data to augment the original dataset have developed.Chung et al. 287 proposed GAN-based data synthesis method to produce spec908 tral samples to address the class imbalance problem, thereby enhancing the performance of the 909 ML model trained on the augmented dataset. MatWheel 288 introduced framework that trains 910 the materials property prediction model using the synthetic data generated by the conditional generative model, showing its potential in addressing extreme data-scarce scenarios in materials science. 898 899 906 907 911 913 Multi-fidelity learning Due to the trade-off between cost and accuracy, materials science involves measurements and simulation data with varying degrees of precision. To enable the fusion learning of existing data with different levels of accuracy, researchers have proposed multifidelity learning. 916 Its objective is to maximize the utilization of existing data for high-accuracy 917 914 915 model predictions while minimizing additional computational and human resource costs. Pilania et al. 162 introduced this approach using co-kriging to fuse low-cost, low-accuracy DFT calculations with sparse high-fidelity data, achieving accurate electronic band gap predictions at significantly reduced computational cost. Further, MODNet 163 replaced Gaussian process regression with DNN while learning about the differences between highand low-quality values, which shows significant improvement in the results compared to learning on the sole high-quality 923 experimental data. In contrast, MD-HIT 289 addresses the redundancy problem inherent in multisource datasets, employing greedy incremental algorithms to filter overlapping samples and prevent overestimation of performance, thereby enabling more realistic evaluation and improved 926 generalization to out-of-distribution materials. 922 921 919 920 918 927 924 Few-shot Learning Few-shot learning, which is training model on small number of labeled 928 examples, can help models quickly learn new tasks, especially when there is not lot of good 929 training data available. Meta-MGNN 164 was the first works creating meta-learning frameworks 930 for predicting molecular characteristics. This framework allows models to quickly adapt to new 931 attributes with training on few instances, and also use self-supervised learning from molecular structures to make up for the lack of labeled data. AttFPGNN-MAML 165 built on this by combining hybrid molecular representations fingerprints and graph neural networks with ProtoMAML 934 meta-learning. This made it easier to adapt to new prediction tasks. Most recently, MolFeSCue 166 moved the field forward by adding dynamic contrastive loss functions that let pre-trained 936 models learn useful representations from very unbalanced and small amounts of training data. It addresses the challenge of data scarcity in drug discovery and materials research. 937 933 932 935 3.5.2 Knowledge integration 939 Knowledge integration in AI4MS refers to using relevant knowledge from materials science to 940 guide the design and training of AI models, thereby improving the accuracy, interpretability, and 941 generalization ability of the models. 942 Physics-informed Neural Networks(PINNs) Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are 943 type of general-purpose function approximator that can embed knowledge of any physical laws 944 governing given dataset into the learning process. Chen et al. 167 employs PINNs for the solution of inverse scattering problems that retrieves the effective permittivity parameters of number of finite-size scattering systems in photonic metamaterials and nanooptics. Fang and Zhan 168 947 applied deep physics-informed neural networks for electromagnetic metamaterial design, which 948 can be utilized in dealing with various practical problems such as cloaking, rotators, concentrators, etc. Zhang et al. 169 employ PINNs for defect characterization in mechanical materials, 950 using equilibrium PDEs and constitutive laws to identify internal voids/inclusions from boundary 951 displacement measurements. 946 949 952 Structure-based Knowledge Integration ElemNet 72 and CrabNet 170 only use the elemen953 tal composition of the material as input. They automatically learn chemical relationships and 954 composition-property correlations between elements based on chemical relationships in the pe955 riodic table, without requiring any manually designed descriptors. In addition, GNNs such as 956 MEGNet 171, ALIGNN 290, ROOST 202, and GnoME 154 model molecules and crystals by treating 957 atoms as nodes, bonds as edges, and selectively adding global features such as temperature 958 or pressure. This approach allows deep learning algorithms to make very accurate predictions 959 of features such as formation energy, band gap, and elastic modulus. Based on this general 960 27 modeling, many new studies have incorporated additional prior knowledge of material structure features by introducing new encoding modules or learning objectives to integrate structural knowledge: M3GNet 179 introduced many-body computation module to calculate the three-body 963 and many-body interactions; NequIP 291 proposed E(3)-equivariant neural networks using geometric tensors and equivariant convolutions based on tensor products with spherical harmonics, which introduces feature encoding of the rotational and translational symmetries of the material structure. Allegro 292 removes atom-centered message forwarding while maintaining equivariance by employing learned representations in iterated tensor products. 968 965 961 962 964 967 Ontology and Knowledge Graph Integration As discussed in Section 3.2, extensive knowledge bases and knowledge graphs have been constructed from various sources, including academic articles and experimental analyses. This organized knowledge in databases, covering 971 multiple kinds of knowledge in materials science, can then be used to enhance model performance in material property prediction tasks. Zhao et al. 172 is specifically designed to address 973 the challenges of data heterogeneity in materials science. It uses knowledge graphs as semantic integration center and combines ontology mapping and automatic annotation to extract information from academic articles. Both KCL 173, KANO 174, ESNet 293 construct an elementcentric knowledge graph capturing intrinsic physical and chemical attributes of elements and 977 leverages it in multimodal or contrastive learning framework to unify structural features with 978 semantic chemical knowledge for improved molecular and materials property prediction. Recent innovations combine LLM with knowledge integration: MOFs-KG 294 createed the first comprehensive KGQA benchmark specifically for materials science (MOFs) with 644 complex natural language questions, demonstrating ChatGPTs systematic application to domain-specific knowledge graphs. 979 981 982 983 974 972 975 976 980 986 984 Pre-trained Model Pre-trained models have been demonstrated to be effective in natural language processing, especially in data scarcity scenarios. Through training with limited data, pretrained models can be transferred to specific task while showing strong performance. In materials science, pre-trained model are also widely used. Early work, like Mat2Vec 203, learned word 987 embeddings in materials literature without human supervision, showing surprising capability 988 to identify semantics in materials science text. This led to the development of material-specific 989 language models such as MatSciBERT 178 and MaterialBERT 295. They collect large corpus 990 of materials science for continual training without changing the BERT architecture. Compared 991 to vanilla BERT, they show superior performance in identifying material-related property data 992 and phrases in the literature. This conclusion contributes to the emergence of various BERT 993 variations that were particular to certain materials subfields, such as BatteryBERT 175 for batteryrelated material, OpticalBERT 176 for optical materials, PolyBERT 296 for polymers materials, and 995 SteelBERT 297 for metallurgy materials. UniMat 177 propelled the field forward by merging multiple modes (atomic structure, XRD patterns, and composition) into strong joint embeddings. This made it easier to find novel materials. SmileyLlama 298 is further eolved with Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) to optimize the structure generation. Recent ideas deal with structural limitations: Huang et al. 299 proposed self-supervised and multimodal pre-training technique 1000 that can predict performance based only on stoichiometry, without explicit understanding of the 1001 atomic structure. MELT 300 was the first to employ curriculum-based continuous pre-training, 1002 which used semantic knowledge graphs to convert models from broad-domain knowledge to 1003 material-specific concepts in systematic way. 1004 997 999 994 996 28 3.5.3 Multimodality Recent advances in applying artificial intelligence to materials research have demonstrated the 1006 benefits of domain-specific language models, graph-based predictors, and image analysis frame1007 works 292,295,301. To effectively discover novel materials, agentic LLMs must process and under1008 stand multimodal data at each stage of the pipeline, not only as more inputs, but as prereq1009 uisite for closing the loop, where each stage and component produces distinct modalities that 1010 must be jointly interpreted for decision-making 59,302,303. Most existing improvements are lim1011 ited to single-model scenarios, where algorithms are designed for only single type of data. 1012 However, scientific research often uses multiple types of input for representation, such as text 1013 reports, structural graphs, microscopy images, and spectroscopic signals. Each representation 1014 reveals the materials properties from different perspective. Integrating different types of data 1015 into single analytical framework is challenging due to methodological and infrastructure issues. 1016 This section will explore these issues, first introducing the characteristics of multimodal scientific 1017 data, and then gradually delving into the various methods designed to integrate the data, with 1018 success defined in terms of cross-modal generalization, more reliable mechanistic inference, 1019 and improved closed-loop decision-making. 1020 Multimodal Scientific Data Materials science research increasingly relies on multiple data 1021 sources, each revealing different aspects of material properties, thus requiring tailored data 1022 analysis methods. Using domain-specific language models, textual information from publica1023 tions, patents, and experimental protocols has been put into order. MatSciBERT 178 showed 1024 that it is possible to pull out entities and relationships from scientific literature. The MatSci-NLP 1025 benchmark 304 set up standard tasks for synthesis action extraction, which made it possible to 1026 systematically compare and make further analysis on current methods. 1027 Image-based modalities provide further information at both mesoscopic and microscopic 1028 scales. There are big improvements in deep learning for microscopy, but complete study 305 1029 points out that some problems remains, such as failing to do 3D reconstruction, high reliance 1030 on synthetic data, and lacking enough annotated dataset. Another approach is through spectro1031 scopic and diffraction data. Interpretable XRD analysis 180 shows that multi-phase quantification 1032 remain difficult, especially in the absence of simulation-based guidance. DiffractGPT 306 ana1033 lyzes diffraction profiles in novel way, treating them as sequence data, enabling autoregressive 1034 modeling methods to directly infer atomic structures. 1035 Recent workshops have enriched the research environment by providing multimodal datasets 1036 and benchmarks. The TDCM25 dataset 307 gathers crystalline materials that change with temper1037 ature, along with aligned structural, image, and textual characteristics, which helps with research 1038 on phase transitions. Similarly, Takeda et al. 308 showed multimodal fundamental dataset that 1039 integrates SELFIES molecular representations, DFT-calculated properties, and spectral charac1040 teristics to improve the accuracy of property predictions. NanoMINER 309 utilized language mod1041 els to extract structured knowledge on nanomaterials, connecting unstructured literature with 1042 structured graphs. These improvements show that multimodal resources are becoming more 1043 comprehensive, but they also show that there is still no common metadata or ontologies that 1044 can be used with each other. Because of this, it is still hard to reproduce results across different 1045 modalities. 1046 Beyond crystalline and bulk materials, molecular discovery introduces additional represen1047 tational challenges that require foundation models to be multilingual across structural, physic1048 ochemical, and knowledge-based modalities. To accelerate scientific discovery, foundation 1049 model must become multilingual, able to interpret the vast modalities of scientific data beyond 1050 text. This includes 2D 310 and 3D 311 structures described using geometric graphs, physicochem1051 ical properties (e.g., chirality, electrostatic potentials, and hydrophobicity), and dynamic data 1052 29 from molecular and quantum dynamics (MD/QD). It must also incorporate knowledge from liter1053 ature 312 and knowledge bases 313, such as images, charts 314, and reaction pathways 310. 1054 Some recent work proposed joint molecule and language learning 315 and applied it to power 1055 conversion efficiency for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices 316. However, most molecule lan1056 guage models tokenize at the level of atoms and/or they do not infuse synthesis considerations 1057 up front, which precludes matching tokens with desired functions and/or leads to AI-generated 1058 new molecular targets that are not readily synthesizable. To address these challenges, the recent 1059 highly innovative, functionand synthesis-aware modular Chemical Language Model (mCLM) 312 proposed unified multimodal architecture and suite of specialized encoders to tokenize each 1061 modality into biologically and chemically meaningful language that can be reasoned over. 1062 mCLM incorporates functionand synthesis-related knowledge into the molecule discovery pro1063 cess priori. mCLM generates new data on demand in the forward direction by an AI guided 1064 closed loop, where human scientist simply inputs few natural language phrases or sentences 1065 describing the desired functions of molecule and receives the molecular structure with the best 1066 synthesizable functional modules in return. 1060 However, some additional challenges remain. The self-attention mechanism in the Trans1068 former operates by allowing each token to aggregate information from other tokens based on 1069 semantic relevance 38. This formulation is rooted in natural language processing, where word 1070 embeddings capture semantic associations and attention primarily aggregates unary informa1071 tion across tokens. However, such design may not align well with materials discovery in 1072 the physical world, where governing mechanisms are often determined by explicit pairwise 1073 or relational interactions rather than semantic similarity 317,318. For example, in organic photo1074 voltaic (OPV) materials, key performance-determining factorssuch as donoracceptor energy 1075 level alignment and balanced charge transportare jointly determined by interacting molecular 1076 pairs 319,320. This mismatch suggests that future research should explore attention mechanisms 1077 that explicitly encode binary or relational mutual influence between material entities, introduc1078 ing inductive biases more consistent with physical interaction mechanisms 317,318. Besides, while 1079 unified embedding-based multimodal models often improve predictive accuracy, they frequently 1080 provide limited mechanistic insight, raising concerns that learned representations may reflect 1081 correlations rather than causal or physically grounded relationships 321. 1082 Multimodal Fusion Recent methodological advancements have concentrated on developing 1083 unified representation frameworks that integrate multiple modalities into single representa1084 tion space. MultiMat 181 presented self-supervised foundation model that simultaneously en1085 codes text, structural graphs, microscope pictures, and spectroscopic profiles, thereby augment1086 ing transfer learning for subsequent property prediction. MatBind 322 built upon this by using 1087 contrastive learning aims to align density-of-states, crystal structures, and textual descriptions, 1088 achieving strong cross-modal retrieval. MatMCL 323 also enhanced the robustness of the model 1089 when dealing with data that only has some modalities, proving that multimodal information is 1090 redundant and complementary, and that the model can maintain prediction accuracy even when 1091 one or more modal information is missing. 1092 Other solutions change the way language models work, enabling them to handle non-textual 1093 data. For example, DiffractGPT 306 uses sequential modeling approaches to analyze diffraction 1094 spectra. This shows that methods originally designed for natural language can also be applied 1095 to crystallography. Hybrid systems that combine (GNNs, such as M3GNet 179) with LLMs further 1096 demonstrate how atomic representations can be linked to contextual knowledge in text. There 1097 are also new efforts to set benchmarks. MatVQA 301 establishes multimodal question answering 1098 using figures and text, whereas MaCBench 324 consolidates band structures, microscope images, 1099 and literature, facilitating systematic assessment of general-purpose multimodal models in sci1100 entific endeavors. Fusion models like MATMMFuse 182 use multi-head attention to combine crys1101 tal graph embeddings with SciBERT textual encoders. This consistently makes it easier to predict 1102 formation energies and electrical characteristics. However, most current multimodal benchmarks 1103 emphasize recognition and cross-modal alignment and only partially evaluate multi-step scientific 1104 reasoning or closed-loop decision-makingthe regimes most relevant to autonomous discovery. 1105 These strategies substantially help bring together different signals, but there are still certain 1106 problems that need to be fixed. Unified embeddings can improve forecasts, but they dont help us 1107 understand how things work very well. This raises the possibility that the captured relationship 1108 might show correlations instead of causal ties. Using high-dimensional modalities like micro1109 scope images increases computational and data-engineering costs, which makes them harder 1110 to access. Evaluation protocols are still fragmented. For example, MatSci-NLP 304 only covers 1111 text-based tasks, and there are no common benchmarks for multimodal reasoning or cross1112 modal generalization. TDCM25 307 and MaCBench 324 are two other efforts that show progress 1113 toward shared resources. However, there is currently no consensus in the sector about evalu1114 ation suites. Future research directions encompass the integration of physical invariances into 1115 fusion architectures and the establishment of standardized multimodal datasets featuring inter1116 operable ontologies, both of which are essential for ensuring that multimodal AI significantly 1117 advances scientific discovery and can be evaluated by its contribution to end-to-end discovery 1118 outcomes (e.g., experiment selection, validation throughput, and constraint satisfaction), not only 1119 predictive metrics."

            "title": "3.6 Explainability",
            "content": "1121 Explainable AI is becoming key component of AI-based applications in materials science. This 1122 change is happening because the field increasingly requires models that go beyond forecast1123 ing to provide mechanistic insight, error diagnosis, and trustworthy decision-making 325. This is 1124 considerably more important if we use autonomous agentic LLMs in real-world tests, where ex1125 planations can serve as verification artifacts that gate high-stakes experimental actions. There 1126 are no universally accepted criteria for evaluating interpretations among groups. Alvarez-Melis 1127 and Jaakkola 326 came up with three dimensions: explicitness, faithfulness, and stability. Ex1128 plicitness examines the clarity and comprehensibility of the explanations, faithfulness assesses 1129 whether the relevance score accurately reflects the true determinants of the model output, and 1130 stability assesses the consistency of explanations derived from similar inputs. Other research 1131 also makes distinction between plausibility and faithfulness. Plausibility refers to consistency 1132 with human thinking, while faithfulness refers to adhering to the internal thought process of the 1133 model 327. In comparable framework, Lipton 328 delineated three tiers of model interpretabil1134 ity: simulatability (the entirety of the model is comprehensible to humans), decomposability (the 1135 individual components are interpretable), and algorithmic transparency (the learning process is 1136 comprehensible and reproducible). 1137 In this survey, we consolidate these perspectives into three domain-relevant axes for evaluat1138 ing explainability in AI for materials science: 1139 Physical validity: Do the explanations align with established scientific reasoning and physical laws, making them coherent to human experts? 1141 Faithfulness: Do the explanations accurately reflect the internal thinking process of the 1142 model, rather than being post-hoc approximation? 1143 Stability: Do similar or adjacent inputs produce consistent explanations, ensuring robustness to minor perturbations or noise? 1145 31 These axes provide unified evaluation framework covering sparse closed-form models, atten1146 tion and graph explainers, as well as physics-informed methods. They will guide our subsequent 1147 discussion of interpretability methods. 1148 3.6.1 Sparse and Closed-form Models 1149 In materials science, few explainable models are more prominent than those that generate 1150 sparse closed-form representations between input features and target properties. The SISSO 1151 family of algorithms 183185, symbolic regression methods applied for perovskite catalysis 329 sci1152 entific machine learning with sparse regression for stability equations 330, and dimension-cons1153 trained symbolic regression for band gap prediction 331. Unlike post-hoc explainers, these meth1154 ods directly return human-readable algebraic formulas that may be considered candidate scien1155 tific laws or descriptors. This makes them particularly appealing in domains like materials sci1156 ence, where physical interpretability and mechanism discovery are paramount. However, these 1157 methods typically operate on curated feature sets and may struggle with raw, high-dimensional 1158 modalities, motivating complementary neural explainers discussed next. 1159 Sparse and closed-form models offer two advantages. First, they frequently experience 1160 high levels of faithfulness, because the symbolic expression itself is not proxy, but predic1161 tive model. Second, their emphasis on physically meaningful operators (e.g., ionic radii ratios, 1162 electronegativity differences) improves the plausibility and physical validity. Yet the shortcom1163 ings of these approaches include poor stability: tiny changes in input data or the feature pool 1164 may produce different symbolic forms, which raises questions about reproducibility and robust1165 ness across datasets. The more recent algorithmic progress achieved, e.g., i-SISSO (mutual1166 information prescreening) and VS-SISSO (iterative variable selection), partially mitigates these 1167 problems by improving search efficiency and descriptor stability. Sparse and closed-form tech1168 niques are the best on physical validity and faithfulness overall, but their Achilles heel is stability, 1169 particularly under noisy or heterogeneous data. This limitation is especially consequential in 1170 closed-loop discovery, where unstable descriptors can misguide experiment selection and slow 1171 down exploration. This limitation motivates complementary directions such as attention-based 1172 explainers and physics-informed neural networks, which we discuss in the following subsections. 1173 3.6.2 Attention and Graph Explainers Whereas sparse regression methods provide intrinsic interpretability by expressing structure1175 property relations in closed-form descriptors 183, most state-of-the-art AI models in materials sci1176 ence are deep neural networks, in particular GNNs and transformer-based architectures 325,332. 1177 These models achieve strong predictive performance across wide range of tasks but are of1178 ten criticized as black boxes, since their internal decision logic is difficult to inspect directly. 1179 In response, recent work has introduced both embedded and post-hoc explanation strategies 1180 to make such models more transparent by highlighting which atoms, bonds, compositions, or 1181 spectral features drive individual predictions 325,332. 1182 Representative examples include CrabNet 333, compositionally constrained attention net1183 work whose attention mechanisms surface influential elemental constituents of compound; 1184 GANN 334, graph attention networks for 2D materials property prediction that localizes impor1185 tance to specific atoms and bonds; CrysXPP 188, which trains crystal GNNs under property1186 sensitive explanatory paths to connect predictions with interpretable substructures; and spectro1187 scopy-focused interpreters that generate attribution maps of spectra to identify peaks that con1188 tribute most to the output 187. Together, these approaches move beyond raw accuracy toward 1189 more transparent materials models that can be interrogated by domain experts, even though 1190 32 important challenges remain in ensuring that the resulting explanations are faithful, stable, and 1191 aligned with underlying physical mechanisms. Attention-based and graph-based explainers have strengths in their capacity to provide lo1193 cal, instance-particular reasons, like determining which atoms, bonds or spectral peaks guided 1194 the most prediction 332,335. This increases the physical validity of their measurements, as high1195 lighted elements tend to conform to established chemical intuition. Nevertheless, faithfulness 1196 is not always guaranteed: attention weights may not correspond to the models actual decision 1197 logic, raising the question of whether highlighted features are causally responsible or only corre1198 lated 186. 1199 Stability still remains hurdle, because inputs perturbed in small amounts or random seeds 1200 can modify the highlighted substructures or spectra 335. There are multiple approaches, in1201 cluding integrated gradients 336. It appears that the durability of these explanations in materi1202 als models has been studied, and the proposed robustness is explored by perturbation-based 1203 tests 335. Thus, overall, attentionand graph-based explanation approaches are highly desirable 1204 for supplying domain-plausible, instance-level insights. They are great for alignment with human 1205 chemical reasoning (plausibility/validity) but suffer from challenges in faithfulness and stability. 1206 These limitations motivate hybrid approaches that have combination approach: attention using 1207 perturbation tests or physics-informed constraints, leading into the next subsection on physics1208 informed interpretability. 1209 3.6.3 Physics-informed Interpretability third group of solutions provides intrinsic interpretability by embedding known physical princi1211 ples directly into the model design. Physics-informed methods constrain predictions to physically 1212 consistent families, which builds trust and usefulness in materials research 325. They dont rely 1213 on explanations that come after the fact. Symmetry-equivariant networks, constraint-based ar1214 chitectures, or the strict implementation of conservation and dimensional norms can all help with 1215 this 189. For example, equivariant graph neural networks that take into account the translational, 1216 rotational, and permutational symmetries of crystalline systems 189; models that are limited by 1217 physical invariants like energy conservation or stressstrain relationships 190. 1218 The fundamental benefit of physics-informed interpretability is that it focuses on physical va1219 lidity: predictions follow the known structure of the issue space without making up correlations 169. 1220 Physics-informed interpretability enhances faithfulness, stability, and safety by confining models 1221 to physically valid actions, acting as critical feasibility guards in closed-loop discovery. But these 1222 limits can make it hard to be flexible and generalize when the laws of physics are complicated or 1223 not fully understood. This means that we need hybrid approaches that combine clear physical 1224 rules with data-driven learning to make strong, agentic pipelines."

            "content": "1226 After covering Q2, we discuss the interaction between the materials science fine-tuned LLMs 1227 and the agentic LLMs as shown in Fig. 1. On the one hand, existing pre-trained LLMs lack 1228 plasticity 337,338, focusing on how these two components jointly implement decision-making in our 1229 pipeline-centric framework Moreover, compared to the general pre-training data, MatSci domain1230 specific data, as discussed in Secs. 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, is orders of magnitude smaller even if we 1231 apply techniques like data augmentation as discussed in Sec. 3.5.1. These observations suggest 1232 that most behaviors of fine-tuned models are largely inherited from the pre-training stage, making 1233 it difficult to reliably elicit the desired behaviors using only limited MatSci-specific fine-tuning. 1234 33 Stepping back across the previous subsections, it becomes evident that most current AI4Mat1235 Sci formulations are defined around narrowly scoped, mostly supervised tasks such as property 1236 prediction, information extraction, structure generation, and local optimization, each tied to be1237 spoke datasets that are limited in both quantity and curation quality compared to the web-scale 1238 corpora used for general LLM pre-training as discussed in Sec. 2, and are typically optimized 1239 in isolation from end-to-end discovery outcomes. Even when augmented by multi-fidelity model1240 ing, synthetic data, or automated extraction pipelines, these datasets remain sparse and noisy, 1241 making them at best partial proxies for the rich, open-ended discovery problem that materials 1242 science ultimately cares about, leaving substantial gap between benchmark success and real 1243 experimental impact. straightforward response would be to scale up the quality, diversity and 1244 quantity of supervised MatSci tasks and benchmarks. However, from an end-to-end, pipeline1245 centric perspective that explicitly targets the discovery of novel and useful materials under finite 1246 resources, over-optimizing models for performance on such intermediate tasks risks locking ef1247 fort into local improvements on fragile surrogates (e.g., scores on particular property dataset) 1248 while neglecting whether these gains actually translate into faster, safer identification and vali1249 dation of new functional materials. In this view, the MatSci-tuned tasks surveyed in this section 1250 should be regarded as adjustable operators within larger discovery pipeline, not as endpoints; 1251 their design, data, and evaluation criteria ought to be continuously re-examined through the lens 1252 of the ultimate discovery reward, so that limited high-quality MatSci data is allocated to those 1253 parts of the pipeline that most directly advance real experimental outcomes rather than merely 1254 inflating intermediate scores. Consequently, we argue that effort should gradually shift from 1255 reactive intermediate MatSci benchmarks, as discussed in this section, toward more agentic 1256 systems that explicitly close the loop with simulation and experiment, which will be developed in 1257 detail next. 1258 On the other hand, increasing plasticity of the pre-training or adaptation stage carries the risk 1259 of eroding fundamental safety and security properties. Materials-science-specific tasks cannot 1260 reasonably be expected to cover the full spectrum of normative constraints encoded in general1261 purpose pre-training corpora, so aggressive adaptation must be balanced against the need to 1262 preserve these foundational principles. From the pipeline-centric standpoint, the challenge is 1263 therefore to couple relatively scarce, noisy MatSci supervision with general-purpose pre-training 1264 in way that steers the overall system toward the end-to-end objective of autonomous, safe 1265 materials discovery, without sacrificing the broad alignment and robustness inherited from the 1266 foundation models."

Therefore, 1288 agentic materials discovery establishes new paradigm: AI is redefined as an autonomous sci1289 entific partner that capable of independently generating hypotheses, planning experiments, and 1290 continuously learning through feedback loops 274,361. 1291 An agentic system in materials research operates according to the principle of closed-loop 1292 discovery. Formally, let materials state be represented by descriptor vector Rn, with 1293 measurable properties = (x) obtained through experiment or simulation. Traditional su1294 pervised learning seeks to approximate . In contrast, an agentic system defines control 1295 policy πθ(as) that selects actions (e.g., synthesis parameters, composition proposals) based 1296 on system state (e.g., prior experimental results, model uncertainty) to maximize long-term 1297 objective = E[(cid:80) γtrt]. In materials settings, this reward typically balances experimental per1298 formance, resource cost, and safety considerations rather than only predictive accuracy. RL 1299 thus becomes natural formalism for autonomous experimentation 362. However, in practice, 1300 the state and action spaces are highly non-convex, expensive to explore, and embedded with 1301 scientific constraints such as thermodynamic stability or synthesis feasibility. Consequently, the 1302 success of agentic systems depends on the integration of uncertainty quantification, active learn1303 ing, and surrogate modeling to guide exploration efficiently 363,364. This integration distinguishes 1304 fully agentic pipelines 365 from simpler Bayesian optimization loops by coupling rich state repre1305 sentations. 1306 Autonomous Loops: Self-Driving Labs and Multi-Agent Hierarchies Self-driving laborato1307 ries (SDLs) play an important role in autonomous loops. An SDL combines robotic hardware 1308 for synthesis and characterization with AI models that predict outcomes, evaluate uncertainty, 1309 and iteratively plan the next experiment 366. In these systems, the learning algorithm closes the 1310 materials loop: (1) Design and selection: propose an experiment or select programs in the 1311 database, (2) Execution: perform synthesis autonomously, (3) Evaluation: measure outcomes, 1312 and (4) Evolution: retrain the model on updated data. This cycle implements concrete credit as1313 signment from measured outcomes back to the models that propose and prioritize experiments. 1314 Studies in autonomous thin-film optimization 367 and catalyst discovery 341 have demonstrated 1315 that such loops can simplify experimental search spaces and preserve physical interpretability 1316 at the same time. AIs job in autonomous loops shifts from passive reasoning to agentic cognition 1317 with the ability to autonomously generate and evaluate hypotheses. 1318 Recently, hierarchical and multi-agent architectures have been developed to extend this au1319 tonomy recently. For example, MatExpert 368 utilized multiply stages to mimic the human mate1320 rials design experts workflow. In multi-agent system design, there is no longer just one single 1321 decision-making entity. The discovery process is decomposed into several specialized agents, 1322 such as Predictor, Planner, and Verifier. Those agents can communicate with each other via 1323 standardized protocols 342. The Predictor utilizes neural networks (e.g., CHGNet 339, ALIGNN 343) 1324 to evaluate candidate materials, while the Planner uses Bayesian optimization or RL to choose 1325 the promising directions in the action space. The Verifiers are embodied by robotic automation 1326 and are capable of conducting experiments and sending the results back to the shared memory. 1327 These architectures enable modular expansion and enhance explainability. Each agent follows 1328 36 well-defined scientific rubric and simulates the division of human labor within research teams. 1329 Safe Exploration and Future Ecosystems Agentic systems must also balance exploration 1330 and exploitation. Pure exploitation may converge to local optima because it continuously re1331 fines known successful materials, while unbounded exploration wastes too many resources on 1332 random new paths. Techniques such as upper confidence bound (UCB) sampling and Thomp1333 son sampling in Bayesian optimization frameworks 369 provide theoretical guarantees for efficient 1334 exploration. Meanwhile, recent RL approaches integrate epistemic uncertainty from ensem1335 ble models 370 to quantify the expected information gain of each new experiment. In materials 1336 discovery, this translates into quantifiable trade-off between novel compositions and reliable 1337 performance. Such uncertainty-aware strategies embody the concept of safe exploration in the 1338 physical sciences 371. Another important development is the emergence of simulation and experiment in hybrid 1340 simulation-experiment loops 372. High-fidelity simulations, including density functional theory 1341 (DFT) or molecular dynamics (MD) can act as virtual laboratories, generating synthetic data 1342 to pre-train models or provide experimental priors. Frameworks like DeepMD 344 and CHGNet 339 provide fast computation that makes it capable of running millions of virtual experiments be1344 fore single synthesis is attempted. Agentic systems that combine simulation with experiment 1345 bridge the gap between computation and reality. Virtual agents can co-evolve with their physical 1346 counterparts, which is closely related to the concept of digital twins for materials discovery 373. 1347 1343 The future trajectory of agentic systems will likely involve scientific multi-agent ecosystems 374, 1348 in which autonomous entities collaborate, compete, and refine hypotheses and ideas under 1349 shared goals. By combining LLMs for reasoning and documentation with RL planners and sim1350 ulation engines, these ecosystems could perform discovery, hypothesis explanation, literature 1351 grounding, and experimental justification in natural language 375377. Such AI laboratories will 1352 require governance mechanisms 378 to ensure safety and reproducibility, but they are also capa1353 ble of compressing the scientific feedback cycle from months to hours. 1354 In summary, agentic systems represent the emergence of AI, robotics, and scientific reason1355 ing into unified framework for autonomous scientific discovery. This trend shows change 1356 from using models only to speed up predictions to using them as cognitive and experimental 1357 co-pilots that actively guide the discovery process. In this process, machines not only compute 1358 results but also design the path to discovery. The next subsection explores how this transition 1359 naturally leads to the concept of Scientist AI: systems capable of generating and testing scientific 1360 hypotheses beyond pattern recognition towards end-to-end discovery."

            "content": "1362 The new phase in AI for materials science goes from making accurate predictions to using AI to 1363 do scientific reasoning on its own. This means systematically acquiring, testing, and changing 1364 beliefs about the physical world 349. Early deep learning frameworks such as CGCNN 99 and 1365 ALIGNN 343, discussed in Sec. 4.1, are capable of learning intricate structureproperty mappings. 1366 However, they cannot articulate hypotheses, mechanisms, or explanatory frameworks 349. In contrast, scientist AI system 94 aims to operationalize scientific reasoning. 1367 It indepen1368 dently formulates hypotheses, orchestrates virtual or tangible experiments, and updates its in1369 ternal models in response to the resultant evidence 361.Instead of just guessing what attributes 1370 would happen with certain inputs, this kind of system keeps and improves list of possible ex1371 planations for how structure, processing, and environment affect behavior 349. It also looks for 1372 data that will help test and improve those explanations 349. Previous research on robot scien1373 tists 379 and self-driving laboratories 380 illustrates aspects of this concept, wherein automated 1374 37 systems repetitively suggest experiments, gather data, and revise internal models accordingly. 1375 This sub-section delineates emerging methodologiesactive learning, autonomous experimen1376 tation, symbolic inference, and literature-grounded reasoningas approximating various ele1377 ments of reasoning-centric workflow. Nonetheless, these elements have yet to be amalga1378 mated into cohesive scientific methodology: hypotheses are infrequently articulated, causal or 1379 mechanical reasoning is limited, and the integration of priors across modalities remains fragile. 4.2.1 Hypothesis Generation and Search Over Scientific Spaces 1381 One of Scientist AIs main skills is using priors, evidence, and uncertainty to recommend path1382 ways in the materials space 349. Predictive models can inform practitioners what the attributes of 1383 target will be based on certain inputs. However, making hypotheses demands working in orga1384 nized scientific domains where composition, processing parameters, mechanisms, and physical 1385 restrictions all matter 349. Recent advancements in machine learning and autonomous testing 1386 exhibit significant potential for proposal generation; yet, they still lag far behind human scientific 1387 thinking 350. 1388 Contemporary Bayesian optimization (BO) and active learning frameworks have exhibited 1389 robustness in suggesting useful experiments characterized by quantified uncertainty. These 1390 methods usually use Gaussian process surrogates or similar probabilistic models 345. The goal 1391 is to find balance between exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional design spaces 346. 1392 In materials science, BO has facilitated the swift optimization of alloys, catalysts, and thin-film 1393 systems 350. It helps reduce the number of trials by several orders of magnitude and allowing 1394 for closed-loop experimental workflows 271. These systems partially implement the hypothesis1395 proposal phase of scientific reasoning by identifying promising areas inside the design space 1396 amongst existing uncertainty 381. 1397 Generative models offer an alternative approach to hypothesis formulation. Variational au1398 toencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion-based models have been utilized in 1399 molecular and crystalline design 382, yielding candidate structures tailored to certain target prop1400 erties or design goals 383. These methods increase the effective hypothesis space, allowing for 1401 the investigation of chemically valid yet previously unrecognized compositions and microstruc1402 tures. Recent research illustrate inverse-design workflows wherein generative models provide 1403 candidates that fulfill various objectives or constraints, including stability and performance thresh1404 olds, succeeded by evaluation using high-fidelity simulations or experiments 382. 1405 LLMs add another way to come up with hypotheses. LLMs and science-specific variations, 1406 like SciBERT, can read lot of scientific texts and make sense of them 42. They can also 1407 find domain-specific entities and relationships and provide mechanistic narratives or qualita1408 tive design rationales 384. Recent agentic systems that link LLMs to chemistry and materials 1409 tools demonstrate that these models can suggest reaction pathways, enumerate viable synthetic 1410 routes, and advocate for experimental parameter sweeps by utilizing patterns found in the litera1411 ture and outputs from external tools 385. These systems are increasingly including explicit priors 1412 and limitations when used with retrieval and organized knowledge bases 384. This makes it easier 1413 to come up with hypotheses that are based on current materials knowledge and makes it easier 1414 to integrate with that knowledge 347. 1415 Even with these improvements, todays systems still do not use hypothesis generation in 1416 scientifically sound way. First, hypotheses are seldom articulated openly; the majority of 1417 approaches provide candidate points or structures without delineating the corresponding me1418 chanical assumptions, validity regimes, or expected failure mechanisms 350. Second, generative 1419 proposals are frequently assessed solely via surrogate property predictors, exhibiting minimal 1420 linkage to falsifiable assertions or established theories, hence limiting their function in systematic 1421 38 hypothesis testing and refinement 350. Third, constructing long-horizon hypotheseslike multi1422 step reasoning from mechanism to candidate design to experimental protocolcontinues to be 1423 fragile and heavily reliant on limited training distributions or manually generated prompts 386. 1424 Lastly, even though LLM-based agents seem to be able to combine literature and coordinate 1425 tools, their factual reliability, calibration, and grounding in domain knowledge are still problems 1426 that need to be addressed. This is shown in broader evaluations of foundation models 387 and 1427 domain-specific LLMs for chemistry 347. 1428 All of these changes show that AI systems may suggest candidate materials, designs, and 1429 mechanistic theories based on data and with an awareness of uncertainty 349. Nonetheless, they 1430 have not yet produced organized, falsifiable hypotheses or engaged in systematic reasoning on 1431 alternative explanatory theories 386. To improve this skill, generative modeling has to be more 1432 closely linked to physical limitations, clear hypothesis representations, and systematic uncer1433 tainty quantification within larger agentic loop for autonomous materials discovery 349. 1434 4.2.2 Scientific Critical Thinking 1435 Unlike general-domain LLM reasoning, chemical reasoning must deal with uncertainty, con1436 founded and scarce datasets, and slow, costly experimental feedback 349,350. Literature data 1437 is often noisy or conflicting, and learning frequently depends on imperfect proxy rewards from 1438 simulations, since reliable signals from laboratory experiments are scarce and costly 349. At the 1439 same time, molecular discovery is inherently multi-objective, where improving one function can 1440 come at the cost of damaging another 388. 1441 Human cognition is often described as two modes of thought: System 1 (fast thinking) and 1442 System 2 (slow thinking) 348. System 2 is crucial for complex problems that require deeper and 1443 deliberate decision-making. Recent work on Energy-Based Transformers frames thinking as 1444 an optimization that not only feeds richer context but also assesses the plausibility of its own 1445 predictions and dynamically determines when to halt reasoning 351. Future research should aim 1446 to develop System 2style thinking agent to anticipate the functions and interactions of gen1447 erated molecules in future physical states and encode these imagined outcomes as additional 1448 input, enabling deliberate reasoning and hypothesis generation 351. The model should also gen1449 erate and evaluate alternative hypotheses, fill in missing contextual information, and connect 1450 disparate findings 389. Rather than trusting all sources equally, it should assign weights to claims, 1451 hypothesize negative results, and actively resolve conflicting evidence 389. To improve its causal 1452 understanding, the model should simulate counterfactual alternative molecular designs and their 1453 expected outcomes 390, prioritize underexplored regions of chemical space through active learn1454 ing, especially those characterized by conflicting evidence or high uncertainty in counterfactual 1455 simulations 388."

            "content": "1457 Another important skill for Scientist AI is being able to plan experiments and simulations when 1458 things are uncertain 349,350. In this situation, planning is choosing the next actionsnew mea1459 surements, simulations, or adjustments to the processthat are thought to be the most useful or 1460 informative based on the present hypotheses, available data, and priors 352. Experiment and sim1461 ulation planning, on the other hand, needs decisions to be made in order with restricted budgets, 1462 different costs, and safety or feasibility limits on which activities can be taken 353. 1463 Modern materials informatics has created wide range of tools for flexible experimental de1464 sign 349. Active learning and Bayesian optimization frameworks utilize uncertainty-aware surro1465 gate models and acquisition functions to dynamically select fresh measures that either optimize 1466 information gain or enhance specified property 350. Optimal experimental design formalizes 1467 39 the challenge as trade-off between elucidating the response surface and differentiating among 1468 competing models, frequently within the confines of limited resources 352,353. These methods al1469 ready allow practitioners to decide which composition, processing condition, or microstructure to 1470 evaluate next based on current surrogate and its uncertainty estimates. However, they typically 1471 optimize scalar objectives or predictive uncertainty rather than explicitly targeting hypothesis dis1472 crimination or mechanistic insight 350. In self-driving laboratory (SDL) architectures, planning experiments and automating the lab 1474 have been closely linked. Closed-loop platforms for thin-film and semiconductor discovery com1475 bine robotic synthesis and characterization with BO-based planners to autonomously search 1476 process spaces and improve multi-step recipes 271. Multi-objective and restricted Bayesian op1477 timization has facilitated these platforms in managing trade-offs among competing performance 1478 measures while adhering to intricate experimental limitations, thus enhancing Pareto fronts for 1479 conductivity, transparency, or mechanical properties 150. Recent reviews combine these changes 1480 and show that SDLs can be used as general framework for planning closed-loop experiments 1481 in chemistry and materials science 349. From pipeline-centric viewpoint, SDLs implement end1482 to-end credit assignment by directly linking model updates and planner behavior to experimental 1483 outcomes, as opposed to relying exclusively on offline proxy metrics 349. 1484 Emerging LLM-based agents enhance experiment and simulation planning by integrating lan1485 guage models with laboratory control systems, computational tools, and data services. Chem1486 Crow 122 and other chemistry agents show that LLMs with special tools can design reaction se1487 quences, call simulators, query databases, and suggest follow-up experiments based on in1488 termediate results. Autonomous research frameworks utilizing general-purpose LLMs 385 have 1489 demonstrated the capacity to strategize and implement multi-step experimental campaigns, en1490 compassing the selection of conditions, coordination of robotic platforms, and iterative enhance1491 ment of protocols 349. Recent research assesses LLM agents for the automation of particular 1492 experimental modalities, like atomic force microscopy, underscoring both the potential and the 1493 existing fragility of language-model-driven laboratory control 391. These systems are starting to 1494 integrate symbolic thinking, protocol generation, and tool invocation into single planning cycle. 1495 Even with these improvements, todays experiment and simulation planners still fall short of 1496 expert scientists in multiple dimensions. Most Bayesian optimization and active learning frame1497 works focus on optimizing scalar objectives or surrogate uncertainty; they do not explicitly repre1498 sent or update structured hypotheses 352. Acquisition functions are usually defined over design 1499 variables instead of explanatory models or mechanisms. Consequently, campaigns seldom aim 1500 to differentiate between rival mechanistic hypotheses, delineate phase boundaries with measur1501 able confidence, or conduct stress tests in areas of theoretical ambiguity. Ad hoc filtering is 1502 typically used to deal with practical problems like scheduling, equipment failures, maintenance 1503 windows, or safety limitations, instead of using systematic decision-theoretic formulation 349. 1504 LLM-based planners can create flexible protocols and coordinate tools, but they are still restricted 1505 by hallucinations, poor calibration of uncertainty 385, and inadequate guarantees that they will fol1506 low safety or physical rules 122. Achieving scientist-level experiment and simulation planning will 1507 probably necessitate the amalgamation of uncertainty-aware optimization, explicit hypothesis 1508 representations, constraint-aware scheduling, and verifiable control of automated platforms into 1509 cohesive framework for comprehensive materials discovery."

            "content": "1511 Within the Scientist AI system, the interpretive part of the reasoning process is what pits new data 1512 against old hypotheses and comes up with new ones that better explain the facts. Section 3.6 1513 It introduced physical 1514 discussed how to make AI explainable in materials science in general. validity, faithfulness, and stability as ways to evaluate explanations 392. In this context, these 1515 40 axes measure how well explanations help revise hypotheses instead of just checking models: 1516 Scientist AI must use explanations to figure out which hypotheses are still valid, which are clearly 1517 wrong, and where more data would best improve the set of hypotheses 393 394. 1518 Post hoc explanation techniques, such as feature attribution (e.g., LIME 354, SHAP 395) and 1519 saliency analyses, are now commonly utilized in composition-based models, graph neural net1520 works, and other architectures 392. In materials science, these methods show which structural, 1521 compositional, or processing features affect individual predictions and whether models seem 1522 to be based on chemically plausible patterns 392 393. Attribution methods for graph-based mod1523 els that pinpoint importance to atoms, bonds, or subgraphs further link predictions to specific 1524 motifs and have been evaluated on tasks with known ground-truth functional groups or struc1525 tural units 335. From the standpoint of hypothesis revision, these tools facilitate constrained 1526 form of testing: novel data can be evaluated for coherence between emphasized features and 1527 the mechanistic narrative embedded in specific model class; however, the explanations them1528 selves typically do not preserve or revise an explicit hypothesis set. 1529 As discussed in Sec. 3.6, sparse and closed-form models like SISSO and symbolic regres1530 sion are unique in the explainability landscape 183 396. Within the framework of Scientist AI, their 1531 primary contribution is to furnish explicit candidate hypotheses as human-readable descriptors 1532 or analytical laws that are subject to direct examination, scrutiny, and modification. Descriptor1533 discovery workflows that incorporate SISSO-style algorithms or symbolic regression into active 1534 the system 1535 learning loops for electrocatalysis and other applications exemplify this potential: not only modifies parameters within static model but can also transition between different 1536 functional forms as new data emerges 397. AI Feynman and other general equation-discovery 1537 frameworks show that it is possible to get governing equations from data in idealized settings 398. 1538 This suggests way to make reasoning modules that work with and choose between symbolic 1539 hypotheses instead of just updating neural weights that are hard to understand. 1540 Even though these systems have improved, they still dont fully meet the needs of Scientist 1541 AI when it comes to interpreting and revising hypotheses. Most methods discussed in Sec. 3.6 1542 mainly focus on local or model-centric explainability, and their faithfulness and stability when the 1543 distribution shifts or the dataset is biased are still limited 392,394. Symbolic techniques are getting 1544 closer to clear, testable hypotheses, but they still only work in low-dimensional environments and 1545 need lot of expert input on feature spaces and operator sets 183,396. Emerging LLMand agent1546 based systems can generate textual rationales, alternative mechanisms, or literature-grounded 1547 critiques in response to new data 107,399, yet these explanations are seldom tied to formal rep1548 resentation of hypothesis set, nor evaluated on their ability to drive correct revisions of that set 1549 over multiple iterations of data collection. To reach scientist-level interpretation and hypothesis 1550 revision, it is therefore essential to move beyond the primarily diagnostic explainability criteria 1551 and methods of Sec. 3.6 toward explicit hypothesis tracking, uncertainty-aware selection among 1552 competing mechanistic models, and benchmarks that directly measure how effectively an AI 1553 system revises and refines scientific hypotheses within closed-loop discovery process."

            "content": "1555 Existing molecular AI systems remain static learners trained on historical literature data and often 1556 fail to adapt to new experimental evidence or improve through real-world feedback. Specifically, 1557 future work should establish closed-loop digitalphysical workflow where high-throughput, 1558 autonomous laboratory can synthesize AI-selected molecules with minimal human involvement 400,401. Recent work 312 proposed to position mCLM as core agent of human-in-the-loop autonomous 1560 laboratory, iterating through reasoning, proposal, synthesis, testing, and feedback from real1561 world synthesis and testing machines to enable never-ending improvement alongside human 1562 1559 41 scientists, by leveraging LLM agents self-improvement 402,403 and self-evolving 404 capabilities. As artificial intelligence systems mature from tools of prediction to agents of discovery, 1564 central question has increasingly been posed: how should humans and machines collaborate in 1565 the pursuit of scientific progress 405? The further improvement of AI4MatSci will not be achieved 1566 only by algorithmic and computational power. It will also depend on the design of humanAI 1567 workflows that involve human intuition and domain insight alongside machine-scale reasoning, 1568 data integration, and hypothesis generation 378,406. This convergence motivates the design and 1569 use of co-creative intelligence 407, in which AI could serve as scientific collaborator. 1570 Early examples of such collaboration have already affected the materials design cycle. In 1571 prediction and generation tasks, researchers use interpretable graph neural networks (GNNs) 1572 such as ALIGNN 343 or CrabNet 333 to provide explanations for learned structureproperty re1573 lationships, facilitating scientific validation and hypothesis refinement. These models support 1574 two-way interaction between human insight and model-driven suggestions. AI can highlight 1575 correlations that are hard to detect intuitively in high-dimensional feature spaces while human 1576 scientists can test and interpret their physical plausibility. Studies in explainable materials mod1577 eling show that transparent model architectures, such as attention mechanisms revealing atomic 1578 contributions or saliency mapping over crystal graphs, can perform scientific structural reason1579 ing from numerical output. 406. Such methods are critical for enabling trust calibration, where 1580 researchers learn not to over-trusting and under-trusting 408. 1581 LLMs further facilitate the interaction between AI and humans by introducing natural-language 1582 interfaces into the workflows. LLMs that are fine-tuned on domain-specific training resources 1583 such as experimental protocols and computational reports can effectively parse, summarize, and 1584 contextualize scientific results. Recent systems like MatGPT 355 are capable of solving materials 1585 language processing tasks by conducting workflows, querying crystallographic databases, and 1586 helping experimental setups by giving suggestions in natural language 356. By integrating multi1587 modal reasoning that combines textual, numerical, and structural embeddings, LLMs can also 1588 serve as adaptive documentation and knowledge retrieval systems. These systems can evolve 1589 with laboratory data streams. In this manner, humanAI collaboration is expansive, from mere 1590 task execution to the whole scientific lifecycle: from idea creation to experiment construction and 1591 execution, validation, interpretation, and publication 409. 1592 AI systems are becoming more and more autonomous, which makes human scientists be1593 come less directly involved in low-level decision-making. This will reduce the participation of hu1594 man agency and makes co-creation more difficult in some scenarios. More and more AI systems 1595 like ChemOS 359 can enhance the planning and execution of experiments in self-driving labs. In 1596 this case, human scientists should foucs more on higher-level management, ethical oversight, 1597 supervision, and conceptual innovation 366. Interface design further contributes to more effec1598 tive collaboration, which involves designing interpretable feedback loops between algorithmic 1599 reasoning and human comprehension 410. For instance, prospective interfaces can prevent con1600 fusion before it happens. An explainable user interface allows users to interactively explore the 1601 data and model sensitivity so they can predict what and why the AI will do. The AI decision can 1602 construct AI results as structured hypotheses, inviting human assessment to decide whether 1603 accept or deny them. These hybrid decision-making architectures align with the principles of 1604 human-in-the-loop AI, where automation and human expertise together produce more reliable 1605 outcomes than either could achieve alone 378. 1606 second new concept at this stage is scientific collaboration networks, which were originally 1607 developed to analyze collaborations among human researchers 411 and has since broadened to 1608 include hybrid collaborations between humans and AI agents 357. In traditional scientific collab1609 oration networks, nodes are scientists, and edges connect them if the scientists co-authored at 1610 least one paper jointly. Networks were constructed independently for separate fields for com1611 paring the disciplinary patterns. By contrast, nodes in human-AI collaboration networks are 1612 42 specialized agents (software modules) along with human supervision. The framing implicitly fa1613 vors human-agent teaming: humans define goals, agents create and refine hypotheses, and 1614 humans evaluate, execute, and validate results. This structure acts much like human research 1615 team. Different members have different roles that work well together, and they talk to each other 1616 through shared interfaces to plan their work. 1617 From an epistemological point of view, the collaboration of humanAI technology signifies 1618 paradigm shift in scientific conduct. Rather than knowledge being created solely through hu1619 man deliberation, traditional science cycle by hypothesisexperimentanalysis is bounded by 1620 human thought and speed of human communication 412. Instead, co-creative workflows exist at 1621 the crossroads between symbolic reasoning on the one hand and data-driven discovery, turn1622 ing this cycle into process of feedback loop through AI 412. Transforming experimental data 1623 into organized form representations understandable to humans and machines, these systems 1624 collectively share an epistemic language that brings interpretability and reproducibility 413. 1625 Collaborative frameworks also need to address issues of attribution, authorship, and bias in 1626 the future in order to address the trust and accountability issues 414,415. Designing new archi1627 tectures and evaluation frameworks for trustworthy collaboration is becoming essential. Auto1628 Labs 360 introduces critic agent specifically designed to double-check the safety and feasibility, 1629 while GIFTERS 416 tries to evaluate the AI part along dimensions such as generalizable, inter1630 pretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable trustworthiness principles. The scien1631 tific community is beginning to deal with questions like: Who owns AI-generated hypotheses? 1632 How can we peer review AI-based discoveries? Efforts such as transparent model reporting, 1633 tracking data sources, clear documentation, and continuous monitoring are essential for keeping 1634 the scientific integrity of AI-assisted research 417.Furthermore, applying fairness, transparency, 1635 and accountability principles into materials workflows is crucial for the responsible adoption of AI 1636 in both industry and academia 418. 1637 HumanAI collaboration is reshaping scientific discovery, shifting AI from purely predictive 1638 In materials science, interpretable models and large language sys1639 tool to an active partner. tems bring continuous feedback between human intuition and machine reasoning, integrating 1640 speculation, simulation, and analysis into one workflow. As autonomous frameworks orchestrate 1641 experiments, preserving human agency in the process, open, interpretable interfaces are essen1642 tial. New networks of human and AI agents also appear, showing this move towards co-creative 1643 science. To maintain this partnership and its importance, safety mechanisms, interpretability 1644 guarantees, and scientific alignment protocols are needed to assure that their progressively 1645 autonomous AI systems are accountable and trustworthy, and in line with human scientific ob1646 jectives."

            "content": "1648 After addressing Q3, we continue our discussion on the end-to-end pipeline-centric perspective, 1649 focusing more on the role of agentic LLMs in materials discovery. Yann LeCun has famously 1650 argued that if intelligence is cake, the bulk of the cake is unsupervised learning, the icing on 1651 the cake is supervised learning, and the cherry on the cake is reinforcement learning (NeurIPS 1652 2016), thereby downplaying the centrality of RL relative to representation learning via large1653 scale pre-training. In contrast, Silver and Sutton 93 argue that intelligence should fundamentally 1654 be grounded in interaction with the environment, thereby elevating the role of RL and other 1655 experience-driven approaches to primary mechanism for building general intelligence. Rather 1656 than engaging directly with this broader conceptual debate, we instead focus on the concrete 1657 demands of materials science, where discovery is inherently interactive: hypotheses must be 1658 tested through simulations and (preferably) experiments, so learning through experience is less 1659 43 optional than it is in purely digital areas. 1660 Given the domain-specific uniqueness outlined in the preceding subsections, these consid1661 erations collectively indicate that an agentic system constitutes the more appropriate design 1662 choice. However, current agentic systems reviewed in Sec. 4while representing significant 1663 progressremain incomplete from an end-to-end, pipeline-centric perspective for two critical 1664 reasons. 1665 First, lot of current work doesnt use backward credit assignment all the way through the 1666 pipeline. By backward credit assignment, we mean linking the results of downstream discover1667 iesboth successes and failuresback to choices made earlier in the process, such as corpus 1668 selection, objective design, and model adaptation. This way, those parts can be changed un1669 der the same end-to-end pressure. As outlined in Sec. 2 and 3, training signals resulting from 1670 agentic successes or failures (such as unsuccessful synthesis attempts, inaccurate property pre1671 dictions, and breached physical constraints) can theoretically be transmitted backward to prior 1672 stages, including pre-training data curation, domain adaptation objectives, and instruction-tuning 1673 criteria. This backward signal is necessary for the influence-driven correction discussed in Sec. 1674 2.4, where failures in closed-loop discovery immediately tell us which parts of the pre-training 1675 corpus should be made louder, quieter, or eliminated. Without this feedback loop, agentic sys1676 tems stay separate from the basic representations and assumptions built into their models. This 1677 makes it harder for them to change and get better over long periods of time. 1678 Second, most existing agentic systems work mostly in simulations or on synthetic bench1679 marks, not in real experimental settings. Simulation-based agents (e.g., those employing DFT 1680 or molecular dynamics) offer significant prototyping opportunities; however, they obscure essen1681 tial domain constraints, including equipment limitations, measurement noise, synthesis variabil1682 ity, and the inherent irreducibility of real-world chemistry to computational models. As result, 1683 agents that are only trained on simulated loops may find optimal materials that are stable in silico 1684 but impractical or too expensive to make in real life. Real agentic systems for discovering new 1685 materials must be closely linked to robotic labs, experimental feedback, and the messy realities 1686 of physical synthesis and characterization. Agents can only learn useful tactics with affordable 1687 costs that close the gap between simulation and reality if they have strong pre-trained foun1688 dation formed in the upstream stages, with experimentation providing the corrective signal that 1689 refines these priors toward robust, safety-aware autonomous discovery."

            "title": "5 Discussion & Conclusion",
            "content": "1691 This survey synthesizes recent advances in AI for materials science through pipeline-centric 1692 lens that connects corpus curation, pre-training, domain adaptation, and instruction tuning to 1693 goal-conditioned, agentic LLMs operating within open-ended experimental environments. By 1694 jointly organizing the field around three guiding questions, it integrates machine-learning and 1695 materials-science perspectives into single conceptual framework for autonomous materials dis1696 covery. The survey systematically reviews predominantly reactive tasks such as prediction, min1697 ing, generation, optimization, and verification, together with cross-cutting issues in data, knowl1698 edge integration, multimodality, and explainability, clarifying both the strengths and limitations of 1699 current approaches. Building on this foundation, it characterizes emerging agentic systems and 1700 Scientist-AI workflows that couple hypothesis generation, experiment and simulation planning, 1701 and humanAI collaboration, arguing that truly discovery-oriented AI4MatSci requires aligning all 1702 components of the pipeline to real experimental reward signals rather than proxy benchmarks. 1703 Revisiting Fig. 1, the agentic system operating within an open-ended experimental environ1704 ment uniquely accesses real-world outcome signals that can be used for credit assignment at the 1705 current decision stage and retroactively propagated to upstream stages spanning pre-training, 1706 44 materials-specific adaptation, and task design, as detailed in Secs. 2, 3, and 4. From this 1707 vantage point, the concluding section elaborates coherent roadmap that operationalizes this 1708 pipeline-centric view, integrating the insights from the preceding sections into unified picture of 1709 how agentic LLM systems can be aligned with end-to-end materials discovery objectives. Figure 8: Search is defined as trial-and-error, generate-and-test, and variation-and-selection, whereas memory is to remember what worked best for each situation and start from there next time. In these processes, certain level of generalization is expected. The pre-trained and MatScituned LLMs serve as the unified memory. The agentic LLM mostly acts as the search operator interacting with the environment, but it can access and store information during interaction into the memory. The agentic LLM can employ the search operator to interact with either the virtual world (e.g., simulator) or the real world. Following the definition and notations in 419, the directed information I(X ) captures the influence that the past elements Xi have on future elements Yi. Barto 420 observed that reinforcement learning is memorized search and noted that in the 1711 beginning, machine learning was reinforcement learning. From this point of view, general pre1712 training, domain-specific fine-tuning and part of lifelong RL in the experimental environment 1713 serve as unified memory, contributing to the search component of RL, as shown in Fig. 8. 1714 Note that an agentic LLM also relies on the memory function during interacting with the environ1715 ment, as it stores useful information into the memory after searching. 1716 However, recent evaluations 421 show that frontier LLMs can engage in sophisticated reward 1717 hacking in benchmarking environments, indicating that the memory formed by pre-training and 1718 fine-tuning may overfit scoring artifacts rather than reflect robust performance in real experimen1719 tal settings. To mitigate this, experimental environment rewards should be used to reshape up1720 stream memory, data curation, objectives, and weights, thus aligning learning with outcome-level 1721 goals. It has also been argued 422 that small language models are enough for agentic tasks, as 1722 they are sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for 1723 45 many invocations in agentic systems. To some extent, compressing LLMs into small LMs can 1724 be considered as way to modify the upstream components driven by the credit assignment 1725 process mainly based on the final RL reward discovering novel materials in our case. Ideally, 1726 the whole pipeline should be tunable, driven by the final objective. 1727 For MatSci scenarios, we can use the influence function 423 to track down the contributions of 1728 pre-training and fine-tuning data to the discovery of novel and useful materials. It is also promis1729 ing to learn RL rules that are more suitable for MatSci settings, inspired by the success of show1730 ing how to discover state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually designed rules 424. We 1731 encourage both the machine learning and materials science communities to view the pipeline as 1732 whole serving the single ultimate goal discovering novel materials, using which to scrutinize 1733 the upstream components and redesign them through the lens of RL. 1734 As indicated in Fig. 8, an agentic LLM can operate on either the virtual world and the real 1735 world. It is preferable and practical to first train it on the virtual world and then transfer it and con1736 tinually train it in the real-world materials science environment. We should be aware that an agent 1737 cannot learn beyond the knowledge of simulator, meaning that it is not realistic to expect that 1738 an agent can generalize to the knowledge outside of simulator designed by human experts and 1739 domain data. This indicates the potential performance gap between an agentic LLM trained in 1740 the virtual world and the one ideally trained in the real-world environment, which is prohibitively 1741 expensive. closely related and often underemphasized bottleneck is the limited accessibil1742 ity of laboratory automation itself. Democratizing lab automation is critical to addressing the 1743 persistent data scarcity challenge in materials science. Despite recent progress, autonomous 1744 and self-driven laboratories remain expensive, slow to deploy, and heavily dependent on expert 1745 knowledge not only in materials science, but also in mechanical engineering, robotics, and soft1746 ware engineering. As result, adapting an existing automated laboratory to new scientific 1747 objective is still nontrivial and resource-intensive process, restricting the scale and diversity of 1748 real-world feedback available for learning. 1749 We also envision parallel memory+search across the virtual and real worlds, similar to the 1750 concept of asynchronous thinking proposed by Schilling-Wilhelmi et al. 218. 1751 Current benchmarking methods for computational materials discovery mostly focus on fixed 1752 prediction tasks and isolated computational elements, overlooking the inherently iterative, ex1753 ploratory, and sometimes serendipitous nature of real scientific discovery 425. Even though Crys1754 talGym 426 provides APIs that are familiar to RL researchers, it still remains unclear if the perfor1755 mance can be translated into real-world experimental environments. Inspired by digital twins for 1756 materials 373 and co-evolution of agents and the virtual environment 427, where data interface 1757 keeps the digital and physical systems synchronized, we propose to evolve the agent, the virtual 1758 world, and all the components in the upstream stages based on the real-world environmental 1759 reward. While individual components and their associated views each offer limited perspectives, 1760 only systems-level approach can deliver the complete, integrated understanding required to 1761 objectively accelerate materials innovation; this goal underpins the pipeline-centric view of our 1762 survey. Here, modular dynamic AI4MatSci testbed is needed, which can be updated with 1763 real-world data more easily. 1764 In terms of additional algorithmic improvement, differently from previous digital-twins for ma1765 terials discovery, we argue for single shared agent or population of collective agents with 1766 memory 428432 for both simulation and real-world experiments, and even upstream preand mid1767 training. This unified view is also aligned with the concept depicted in Fig. 8, where the whole 1768 pipeline shares single memory across all stages, which can be updated by the final real-world 1769 reward signal. 1770 Bengio et al. 433 warned about the biosecurity risks at the convergence of AI and the life sci1771 ences. Similarly, LLM agent-driven materials discovery and autonomous laboratory workflows 1772 can accelerate beneficial research but also lower barriers for misuse (e.g., designing materials 1773 46 with hazardous properties or enabling access to dangerous synthesis routes). Thus, it is cru1774 cial to develop trustworthy and safe LLM agents for materials science research. We depict the 1775 empowerment-plasticity view 419 in Fig. 8. Empowerment is the extent to which an agent can 1776 shape or control the set of future states it can perceive, and plasticity is the capacity of an agent 1777 to maintain adaptability in the face of significant changes or challenges 419. Interestingly, the 1778 plasticity of the agent is equivalent to the empowerment of the environment, and vice-versa 419. 1779 On the one hand, this implies that, for the safety concerns, the agent might need to dynamically 1780 adjust its plasticity in order to restrain the adversarial empowerment of the environment. On the 1781 other hand, this means that to maximize the overall yields of the whole system over time, the en1782 vironment over which the agent is empowered should often have high plasticity, e.g., with more 1783 controllable components or tools. We argue that AI4MatSci should routinely revisit each module 1784 in the workflow and ask whether it can be brought under learning or optimization pressure rather 1785 than being treated as frozen heuristic. Concretely, this means not only training neural networks 1786 but also learning data selection and curation policies 434, adaptive pre-training corpora, retrieval 1787 and tool-calling strategies, experiment proposal policies, and even aspects of the experimental 1788 protocol itself, using the ultimate reward signals. Our pipeline-centric, end-to-end perspective 1789 thus views the materials discovery loop as composite system in which as many components 1790 as possible are trainable and where signals from successful or failed discoveries can, over time, 1791 reshape both models and upstream pipeline choices to better serve the ultimate goal of find1792 ing novel, useful, and safe materials. Overall, our proposed unified and pipeline-centric view 1793 encourages us to design highly decoupled agents and the corresponding environments to maxi1794 mize output while minimizing risks."
