            "content": "When engaging with academic literature, readers frequently first consult schematic diagrams that illustrate the research framework to quickly grasp the underlying research and identify specific areas of interest. This initial visual reference is crucial as it provides an overview of the studys structure and aims, prompting readers to delve deeper into the paper content for more comprehensive understanding. Given the complexity and high volume of information in scientific papers (Dasigi et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024a; Ajith et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025b; Xu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025), there is significant demand for AI Equal Contributions. Correspondence: Yilun Zhao (yilun.zhao@yale.edu) Figure 1: An overview of the MISS-QA benchmark and research questions investigated in this study. systems that can assist scientists in seeking information from paper through schematic diagrams. Foundation models have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling various complex tasks (Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024; Zhao et al., 2025a). However, their capabilities in interpreting schematic diagrams and synthesizing information from related paper context remain largely underexplored. Previous scientific document QA benchmarks primarily focus on text-only contexts (Dasigi et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2023b), emphasizing information-seeking questions derived from paper abstracts. While recent scientific multimodal QA benchmarks have incorporated multimodal information from scientific papers (Li et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024c,d), their focus is largely limited to analyzing charts or tables that present experimenDataset Input Context Annotation / DatSingle Creation Scientific Figure Understanding ArXivQA (Li et al., 2024b) MMSci (Li et al., 2024d) CharXiv (Wang et al., 2024b) Single scientific chart for experiment results Single scientific chart for experiment results Single scientific chart for experiment results Rewritten from caption by GPT-4V Rewritten from caption by experts Annotated by human experts Scientific Paper QA QASPER (Dasigi et al., 2021) QASA (Lee et al., 2023a) M3SciQA (Li et al., 2024a) Single text-only scientific paper Single text-only scientific paper Multiple scientific papers with charts Annotated by human experts Annotated by human experts Synthesized by GPT-4V MISS-QA (ours) Single schematic diagram and corresponding paper Annotated by human experts Table 1: Comparisons between MISS-QA and existing scientific figure understanding and paper QA benchmarks. tal results. In contrast, reasoning over schematic diagrams introduces unique challenges. It requires understanding not only the visual elements but also their relationships, contextual meaning, and integration with the textual narrative of the paper. Addressing these challenges is critical for advancing AI systems to effectively navigate the multimodal nature of scientific research. To bridge this gap, we introduce MISS-QA, question answering benchmark focuses on Multimodal Information-Seeking over Scientific papers. The benchmark comprises 1,500 expertannotated QA examples over 465 scientific papers, capturing wide range of real-world informationseeking scenarios over scientific literature. For each question, the schematic diagramtypically appearing as the first or second figure in the paper and providing an overview of the researchserves as the focal point. Foundation models are tasked with identifying the highlighted visual element within the diagram and answering the question using the content of the paper. To mirror real-world information-seeking scenarios, where researchers often encounter questions that cannot be answered using the available context, 26.5% of the questions in MISS-QA are intentionally designed to be unanswerable (Asai and Choi, 2021; Sulem et al., 2022). Such questions tests the models ability to discern the limits of the provided information, which is crucial for scientific research. Figure 1 illustrates the key research questions investigated in this study. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We present MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the ability of foundation models to comprehend schematic diagrams in scientific literature. We perform comprehensive evaluation of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, uncovering significant performance disparity between human experts and current models. We analyze model performance on unanswerable questions and conduct an in-depth error analysis, highlighting key strengths, limitations, and opportunities to improve model performance."

In contrast, question answering over scientific papers introduces unique challenges. These include interpreting domain-specific terminology, synthesizing information across multiple sections, and reasoning over multimodal content. However, as shown in Table 1, existing benchmarks in this area mainly investigate the text-only scenarios. Specifically, QASPER (Dasigi et al., 2021) focuses on tasks where questions are derived from the abstract of scientific paper, with answers found within its main sections. Similarly, QASA (Lee et al., 2023b) requires more in-depth reasoning over the paper to answer the questions, yet it also focuses solely on text-based context. The most recent advancement, M3SciQA (Li et al., 2024a), expands scientific paper QA to include multimodal contexts, focusing specifically on interpreting charts that present experimental results. Parallel efforts in scientific figure understanding (Li et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024d) similarly emphasize reasoning over charts. However, these benchmarks overlook other critical visual modalities such as schematic diagrams, which play central role in Figure 2: An overview of the MISS-QA benchmark construction pipeline. many scientific disciplines."

To ensure the high quality of data, MISS-QA adheres to the following three benchmark construction desiderata: (1) Real-world research scenarios: it mirrors real-world information-seeking scenarios in which researchers interact with scientific literature, emphasizing the use of schematic diagrams to swiftly comprehend and navigate intricate information within scientific paper. (2) Schematic diagram interpretation requirement: it demands the interpretation of schematic diagrams, ensuring that models do more than merely scan text for answersthey must genuinely interpret and integrate visual information for reasoning; and (3) Diverse reasoning types: it includes range of reasonExpert Annotator Recruitment and Training. Given the high level of expertise required for MISS-QA, annotation could not be entrusted to crowdsourced annotators. Instead, we recruit 16 human researchers as expert annotators. Their anonymized profiles are detailed in Appendix A.1. Notably, each annotator has authored minimum of three AI-related publications, ensuring high standard of domain knowledge. MISS-QA primarily targets scientific papers across diverse subfields within the AI domain (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning), aligning with the expertise of our annotators. Before commencing the annotation process, each annotator undergoes comprehensive one-hour training session conducted by one of the authors. The screenshots of our developed annotation interface are presented in Appendix A.2. Information-Seeking Scenario and Subset Categorization. To better understand the common information-seeking scenarios researchers encounter when reading scientific papers, we conducted preliminary study. In this study, annotators were given the freedom to read any scientific paper and annotate any type of question that seeks information contained within the context of the paper. This process allowed us to identify four key types of scenarios that frequently arise in practical settings. Based on these findings, we created five subsets of MISS-QA, each tailored to specific information-seeking focuses: design rationale, implementation details, literature background, experimental results, and others. We define each subset and provide corresponding example questions in Table 2 and Appendix B, respectively.

Source Paper Collection We collect AI-related scientific papers from arXiv, focusing on subfields that align with the expertise of our annotators. Specifically, we select papers categorized under Artificial Intelligence, Computation and Language, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition and Information Retrieval. Our dataset includes papers first released between July 1 and November 30, 2024. This time frame is after the cutoff date for most open-source pretraining corpora used to train foundation models, helping to mitigate issues related to data memorization in the models evaluated in this study (Deng et al., 2024). For each paper, we extract its context, including figures and tables, from the HTML1 version provided by the arXiv platform. This process results in total of 465 scientific papers. Source Paper Filtering Five expert annotators (i.e., one for each subfield) are then assigned to manually filter out unqualified papers. Specifically, we exclude (1) papers that are not focused on research (e.g., surveys, position papers, and dissertations), and thus is difficult to design researchrelated questions; (2) papers whose first two figures are both not schematic diagrams or are unsuitable for composing challenging questions that requires figure interpretation; and (3) papers that expert annotators judged to be of low quality or 1https://info.arxiv.org/about/ accessible_HTML.html Figure 3: An example of question posed within an information-seeking scenario related to design rationale. that contained errors in paper parsing based on their assessment.

            "title": "3.3 Question Annotation",
            "content": "Annotators are given papers relevant to their fields to annotate questions following these three steps: Formulating Information-Seeking Question. Annotators are initially given access to the abstract, introduction section, and schematic diagram of the paper. They are required to carefully review these materials to gain an overview of the study. They then identify the essential visual elements (i.e., modules or procedures) within the diagram that are crucial to the research design and often lead to critical thinking or analysis regarding the study. For annotating single question, the annotation interface randomly assigns an information-seeking scenario (as described in 3.1) for the annotator to focus on. Based on this scenario, annotators formulate question that incorporates the essential visual elements from the diagram. Specifically, they are required to follow information-seeking scenarios, aiming to comprehend and navigate intricate information using the schematic diagrams for effective navigation to specific paper sections. The annotated questions are designed to require the models to first interpret the schematic diagram, then navigate to the relevant sections of the paper for in-depth understanding and reasoning. Highlighting Relevant Visual Element. Recent studies have shown that visual content is unnecessary for many examples in current multimodal reasoning benchmarks, as questions can be directly answered from the textual part of the question due to the annotation bias or reasoning shortcut (Yue et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024). To alleviate this issue and ensure that the questions really necessitate interpretation of schematic diagram within the paper, for each question, annotators apply one or two differently colored bounding boxes to highlight specific visual elements within the schematic diagram that are crucial for answering the questions. In the question text, these areas are referred to as the module/process highlighted by [color] bounding box, forcing models to interpret the figure rather than relying on textual clues within the question itself. We also retain the original, unmasked questions within the dataset as reference for future research. Determining Question Answerability and Annotating Evidence. Annotators are initially provided only with the figure, abstract, and introduction sections of paper to annotate questions. Under these constraints, some questions are expected to be unanswerable based on entire paper context. This is intentionally designed as, in real-world scenarios, researchers might ask information-seeking questions that cannot be answered based on the paper context. In such settings, the foundation models should acknowledge that the question is unanswerable instead of hallucinating responses (Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Asai and Choi, 2021). After completing the question annotation step, annotators are given access to the full paper to reassess the questions answerability. For questions deemed answerable, they must identify specific (sub)sections that provide the necessary information. These identified sources are subsequently used for verifying the annotated answers."

The second annotator begins by evaluating the quality of the question to ensure it is clear, challenging, and truly requires the interpretation of the schematic diagram as intended. The annotator is required to revise or discard those low-quality questions. Annotating Evidence and Validating Alignment. Similar to the process in question annotation, the second annotator identifies and selects the relevant sections of the paper containing the necessary information to answer each question. Questions are labeled as unanswerable if no relevant information exists within the paper. The annotation interface compares the evidence annotated by both annotators. In cases of disagreement, the second annotator is provided with the first annotators inputs and asked to validate or revise their annotation. This iterative validation ensures consistency and quality across annotations. Formulating Final Answer. Finally, the second annotator formulates comprehensive and precise free-form answer based on the gathered evidence. Answers must avoid including any external information or knowledge beyond the given paper. Annotators are also encouraged to preserve original phrasing from the paper wherever appropriate to ensure accuracy and fidelity to the paper content."

While proprietary models such as o4-mini and GPT-4.1 have made notable strides in narrowing this gap, open-source models still lag in overall performance. Nevertheless, recent developments in open-source models show promising progress. Notable improvements can be observed within the same model families: Qwen2.5-VL-72B outperforms its predecessor Qwen2-VL-72B by 7.4%, and InternVL3-38B surpasses InternVL2.5-38B by 8.9%. These advancements underscore the rapid evolution of open-source technologies, driven by ongoing innovation and community collaboration. Interestingly, we find that most models, except for Gemini-2.5-Flash and certain lower-performing models like the Phi series, continue to struggle with unanswerable questions.

Extending this work to other scientific disciplines, such as biology and medicine, would enhance its generalizability and applicability across broader research areas. Moreover, we examined the available documentation for each evaluated model, but unfortunately, most models do not disclose detailed information about their pretraining data. This lack of transparency prevents us from definitively determining whether scientific content was included in their training pipeline and, in turn, limits our ability to correlate performance directly to domain-specific training."

Question: Why is [module highlighted by red bounding box] important for [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: Minimizing 2D structural entropy is important for global aggregation because it enables the creation of client graph that captures the internal similarities among clients, which is used to finalize the Global Aggregation strategy, maximizing the external knowledge available to each client while considering client heterogeneity and individual characteristics. Global Aggregation via 2D Structural Entropy Minimization: Relevant Paper Context: Section 4.3 Under the federated framework described in Section 3.1, personalized global aggregation aims to provide clients with maximum external information by producing global models that can benefit individual clients more. The server needs an aggregation strategy that considers client heterogeneity and individual characteristics to maximize external knowledge for all clients. To achieve this objective, we construct client graph Gclient based on clients similarity. By minimizing the two-dimensional Structural Entropy (2DSE) of Gclient, graph capturing the internal similarities among clients is obtained, finalizing the Global Aggregation strategy for each client (SEGA).Gclient is an undirected, fully connected, weighted graph consisting of nodes corresponding to clients, with their similarities as edge weights. The similarity between client models can be estimated by providing them with the same input and measuring the similarity between their respective outputs. On this basis, the server first generates random graph Grandom as input to all client models. With graph pooling, the server obtains different client models representations of the same graph"

Question: What is the motivation behind combining the content of [module highlighted by red bounding box] in this framework? Ground-truth Answer: The motivation behind combining common and private streams in this framework is to effectively minimize the unused and unmet rates by allocating usable power according to traffic requirements, manage interference between unicast and multicast streams, and ensure robustness against imperfect channel state information. Relevant Paper Context: Section 1.2 Motivations and Contributions: We propose an RSMA-based RM framework that minimizes the difference between traffic demands and actual offered rates for both unicast and multicast messages. By flexibly allocating the usable power into the common and private streams according to the traffic requirements, the unused/unmet rates are effectively minimized. To cope with the challenge of obtaining instantaneous CSIT at LEO satellites, we leverage the statistical and geometrical information of satellite-to-user channels, which vary comparably slower, in the RSMA precoder design.

(a) Training pipeline. The consistency between textual and visual features is accurately learned by the MFI-Encoder, which includes Textual-Visual (TV) Fusion module to enhance feature consistency from visual and textual Qformers. (b) The MCL paradigm includes CSCL, aligning high-level semantics by contrasting visual and textual embeddings via CLS tokens, and MACL, which is applied to text embeddings from different cross-attention layers. MACL decouples redundant subject features by aligning positive samples (segmented images of the same subject from various views, positions, and sizes), while preserving relative distances by contrasting with other subjects. Question: How does [module highlighted by blue bounding box] achieve real subject similarity using [module highlighted by red bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: MACL achieves real subject similarity using multiview data by ensuring that the distance relationships between multiscale features are consistent with those of real subjects. This is done by maintaining intra-consistency, where features of the same subject with different situations are as close as possible, and inter-distinctiveness, where the distances between different samples features match those between real subjects. MACL preserves the multi-scale similarity structure, ensuring that the similarities of learned features are positively correlated with those of real subjects. Relevant Paper Context: Section 3.3.2 Multiscale Appearance Contrastive Learning: The key idea of Multi-scale Appearance Similarity Contrastive Learning (MACL) is to ensure that the distance relationships between multiscale features are consistent with those of real subjects. This means the features of the same subject with different situations should be as close as possible (intra-consistency), while the distances between different samples features should match those between real subjects (inter-distinctiveness). As shown in Fig. 2(b)(right), we achieve intra-consistency by pulling positive samples of the reference subject closer, and inter-distinctiveness by introducing scaling factors to align the feature distances with negative samples to real subject distances. In this section, we will introduce the S+Space and MACL in the S+Space. As shown in Fig. 2(b) (right), We select frames different from the reference images as MACL positive samples. By aligning images of the same subject, CustomContrast effectively decouples irrelevant features of the subject. The processing details of positive samples are in Appendix B."

The energy-guided discovery splits unlabeled data into known, seen, and unseen data for better novel category discovery, while variance-based feature augmentation enhances the clustering of unseen data. Lce facilitates better discriminative learning in the online continual learning. Question: What role does [module highlighted by blue bounding box] play in [module highlighted by red bounding box] estimation for online models? Ground-truth Answer: Energy scores are used to classify unlabeled data into known and unknown categories in the first stage, and then further split unknown data into seen and unseen categories in the second stage. This is done by calculating the energy scores using Gaussian Mixture Model to identify which cluster sample belongs to, ultimately facilitating the estimation of seen and unseen data in the online model. Relevant Paper Context: Section 3.3 Energy-Guided Discovery to Identify Unknowns: In Figure 3, we found that the two-stage split of the CGCD struggled to identify both known and unknown categories in our proposed online learning scenario. Online learning with batch-wise data led to severe forgetting in the split network, resulting in poor detection of unknown samples. In contrast, energy-based discovery showed better performance in novel category discovery without extra parameters compared to CGCD. Moreover, as it does not require an additional learning phase, energy-based discovery enables end-to-end training. Inspired by this observation, we propose an energy-guided discovery approach for novel category discovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the energy score for novel category discovery. The process in the second stage is the same as the first stage, where we split the unknown data into seen and unseen categories based on their energy scores. For the initial batch of incremental sessions, the online model is identical to the offline model. Additionally, since the initial batch data is the first data of the incremental session, any data classified as unknown is assumed to be unseen data. The proposed energy-guided discovery splits unlabeled data into known, seen, and unseen categories effectively. Unlike prior methods which require sufficient data, it can identify novel categories with batch-wise data. B.3 Literature Background Diagram example"

Each PPU contains photonic MVM unit and sampling and hold (S&H) unit. (b) Photonic Reuse Method (PRM). Block-wise reuse allows weight sharing among blocks (a block typically contains multiple layers). Layer-wise reuse enables weight sharing between individual layers. (c) Opto-electronic Blend Unit (OBU). OBUs handle shuffle operations via the peripheral circuit and perform transpose operations directly in the optical domain. (d) Computing pipeline of our R&B architecture. Question: What is the relationship between [module highlighted by red bounding box] and [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: The Photonic Processing Unit (PPU) plays role in the R&B architectures computation process where inputs are initially retrieved from eDRAMs to be processed by PPUs. After processing, the outputs are stored back into eDRAMs for the next layer computation. Relevant Paper Context: Section 3.3 Computing Pipeline: The computation process of our R&B architecture contains three stages, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Initially, inputs are retrieved from eDRAMs, and corresponding weights are allocated to MRRs. Subsequently, following the PRM configuration, the weights are fixed and reused, allowing the inputs to pass through the MRRs to be optically weighted. The intermediate MVM results generated by the PPUs are then detected by BPDs, where they are converted into summed currents and digitized by ADCs. In the final stage, OBUs transform these outputs to generate the layer-wise results, which are then stored back in eDRAMs in preparation for the next computational layer. critical aspect of this architecture is the role of the OBU during inference, mirroring its function during training and inference by executing essential shuffle and transpose operations. Subsequently, following the PRM configuration, the weights are fixed and reused. Along with PRM, these two technologies constitute the primary innovation of our R&B architecture. By leveraging one MRR array to represent multiple weight matrices, the architecture dramatically reduces the frequency of MRR writing operations, along with power consumption and latency, all while sustaining high performance."

Question: How does the interaction between [module highlighted by red bounding box] and [module highlighted by blue bounding box] support contrastive learning methodology? Ground-truth Answer: The interaction between invariant encoder and modality-specific encoders supports contrastive learning by enabling the extraction of both modality-specific embeddings and modality-invariant embeddings. Modality-specific encoders, built with Transformer layers, encode characteristics unique to each modality, while the invariant encoder, structured with linear layers, transforms these embeddings into unified vector space, capturing relationships between modalities. This facilitates effective feature fusion and interaction for contrastive learning. Relevant Paper Context: Section 2.4.1 Modality Representation Combinatorial Contrastive Learning: We propose Modality Representation Combinatorial Contrastive Learning (MR-CCL) framework to leverage the given unlabeled data more effectively. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 2. In the realm of multimodal emotion recognition tasks, proven strategy involves extracting features specific to each modality as well as invariant features that capture relationships between different modalities, which facilitates the fusion and interaction of diverse modal inputs (Zuo et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024b). To implement our framework, we begin by pre-training three specificity encoders and one invariant encoder using all available unlabeled data. This process is designed to enable the model to discern and encode the intrinsic characteristics and structural nuances of multimodal data. Each specificity encoder is composed of multiple Transformer layers, while the invariant encoder is structured with linear layers. B.4 Experimental Results Diagram example"

Insights and Best Practices Figure Caption: The overall process of our Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) data synthesis framework. Question: How does the [module highlighted by red bounding box] ensure [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: The Verification Strategy ensures high-quality data output by employing scoring and classification strategies. Scoring involves prompting LLMs to generate continuous scores and setting threshold to determine high-quality data. This strategy captures the nuances of human judgments better than binary classification, which simply classifies samples as high-quality or not. This process ensures consistency, precision, and alignment with human judgment, thus improving data quality. Relevant Paper Context: Section 2.1 Quality Verification Agent: The first module in our framework is Quality Verification Agent, which ensures that the generated questions and answers meet certain standard of quality. This component involves two main processes: Verification Strategy:This includes additional heuristic strategies to judge which samples should be contained as high-quality data. This includes additional heuristic strategies to judge which samples should be contained as high-quality data. Specifically, we utilize two wide-used verification strategies: Scoring: We prompt LLMs to generate continuous scores, manually set more reliable threshold score based on the validation set, and set those exceeding the threshold score as high-quality data. Classification: We prompt LLMs to generate binary classification and select those classified as high-quality data. Verification Condition: Verification Condition:This involves setting specific conditions that both questions and answers must meet to be considered high-quality verification.The process includes: Criteria Perspectives: Criteria include relevance to the document, clarity, factual accuracy, logical coherence, and complexity of the question and answer. Auxiliary Context Information: We integrate additional contextual instructions to enhance the models accuracy and robustness, like guidelines. Auxiliary Generation Information: We enable the model to provide more reasoning rationale during output generation and observe whether this improves the robustness and accuracy of the verification process. Section 3.1.1 Verification Strategy: Scoring is Better Verification Strategy Compared with Classification. As shown in Figure 3 (a), the scoring strategy shows significantly higher kappa and precision scores compared to binary quality classification. This statistical improvement suggests that scoring better captures the nuances of human judgments. This observation aligns with findings in short-context scenarios (Fu et al., 2024a), reinforcing the generalizability of scoring strategies across different lengths of textual data."

Question: How does the [module highlighted by red bounding box] contribute to the updates of [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: The reinforcement learning algorithm contributes to policy group updates by providing systematic approach to search for optimal policies through the performance improvement phase, where model parameters are updated to pursue better performance, and the convergence stabilization phase, where the optimal policy is obtained. The performance at different stages is used to update and save model parameters to the constructed policy group. Relevant Paper Context: Section 4 Data Generation of Scenarios with Varying Difficulty: In Section 3, we introduce the concept of environment agent to realize the adversarial policy search by combining logic rules with reinforcement learning. However, due to the black-box nature of data-driven methods, while adversarial actions can be generated, the difficulty of generating adversarial actions is difficult to quantify accurately, which limits the rationality of adversarial scenario generation. In this section, data generation method based on scenarios with varying difficulty is presented. The method uses the performance of different stages in the policy search convergence process as reference to quantify the adversarial intensity, thereby achieving quantitative representation of scenario difficulty. The model parameters of the environment agent trained on different stages are updated and saved, and then output to the constructed policy group. The policy group is used to generate data that forms the basis for training the scenario difficulty quantitative representation model.. Section 4.1 Verification Strategy: reinforcement learning training process with stable convergence can be divided into two phases, i.e., the performance improvement phase and the convergence stabilization phase. In the performance improvement phase, the average return is still continuously increasing, which indicates that the policy search is still ongoing and the model parameters are still being updated to peruse better performance. In the convergence stabilization phase, however, the average return remains basically unchanged, indicating that the policy search is basically over, and the obtained policy is already the optimal policy that the current algorithm can achieve.

Conventional methods only consider the loss shown in blue but do not optimize the Lipschitz loss (shown in orange) to control the landscape of simulation objective in the subspace. Question: What are potential limitations of using [module highlighted by red bounding box] in neural subspace training? Ground-truth Answer: Potential limitations of using Lipschitz optimization in neural subspace training include the intractability of directly optimizing the Lipschitz constant due to the need to traverse all possible point pairs, sparse gradients that could damage Lipschitz characteristics in certain areas, increased memory usage, and potential memory shortages when training high-resolution meshes. Relevant Paper Context: Section 5.4 Limitation: In this work, Lipschitz optimization is only applied to the elastic potential term of eq. 2. Since the nonlinear mapping is also involved in the inertia term, this may lower the convergence speed of the simulation involving dynamics. Considering that the inertia term is in quadratic form, the Hessian Lipschitz of the inertia term can be optimized by minimizing or bounding the Lipschitz constant of the networks input-output Jacobian . This is promising direction for future work to further accelerate the simulation with dynamics. Another limitation of our method is the extended training time introduced by incorporating Lipschitz optimization into the pipeline. As shown in Table 1, even with cubature acceleration, the training time is still increased by approximately five times compared to the conventional method. This issue can be addressed by employing fast approximate methods to estimate Lipschitz energy."

It demands substantial data to effectively handle multi-scale features while ensuring the models robustness. Additionally, balancing local and global information without conflicts can complicate optimization, particularly in real-time medical applications.

We have adopted an image quality classification network from our previous work , which used ResNet50 as base network with multi-scale and higher-order processing of the image for conducting the holistic assessment of the image quality. The block diagram of this network is shown in Fig. 2. This classifier first extracts features at multiple scales to encode the inter-patient anatomical variations. Then, it uses second-order pooling (SoP) in the intermediate layers (local) and at the end of the network (global) to exploit the second-order statistical dependency of features.

The adjacency matrix, initialized by inheriting from the previous query, stores candidate tokens. Token Recycling first retrieves draft tree from the matrix based on the last token of the current content. The tree is then compressed into merged sequence with corresponding tree attention mask and sent to the LLM for forward pass. After processing, all possible draft sequences are extracted and verified. The longest correct sequence is selected and added to the content. Finally, the top-k candidate tokens are used to update the matrix for the next iteration. Question: How does [module highlighted by red bounding box] interact with [module highlighted by blue bounding box] ? Ground-truth Answer: The tree attention mask compresses multiple sequences into single merged sequence while preserving tree structure. Within this structure, each child node attends only to its parent nodes, preventing sibling tokens from interfering with each other. This allows the LLM to process and verify all possible sequences in parallel. Relevant Paper Context: Section 2.3 The traditional causal attention masks are designed for linear sequences, where each token attends to all previous tokens, restricting speculative decoding to verifying one sequence at time. However, as the sequence lengthens during draft token generation, the number of potential continuations increases. For example, in the draft tree in Figure 2, the token following guest could be speaker or speak, while both at and for could follow speaker. This creates need to verify multiple draft sequences simultaneously. Tree attention modifies the attention mask to address this by compressing multiple sequences into single merged sequence, such as [guest, speaker, speak, at, for, ings], while preserving tree structure in the tree attention mask. Each child node attends only to its parent nodes, preventing sibling tokens from interfering with each other. After the LLM processes the merged sequence, all possible sequences such as guest speaker, guest speaker at, guest speaker for, and guest speak, along with their corresponding output tokens, are extracted based on the tree structure and verified in parallel. Tree Attention: Qwen2-VL-72B: The module highlighted by the red bounding box, labeled \"Tree Attention Mask,\" interacts with the module highlighted by the blue bounding box, labeled \"Merged Sequence,\" by providing attention weights to the tokens in the merged sequence. The tree attention mask determines which tokens in the merged sequence should be attended to during the models forward pass. This allows the model to focus on relevant tokens and ignore irrelevant ones, improving the accuracy of the generated sequence. Error Analysis: Qwen2-vl-72Bs response fails primarily because it does not accurately capture the hierarchical relationship between the modules. It simplifies the interaction, describing the \"Tree Attention Mask\" (red box) as merely providing attention weights to the \"Merged Sequence\" (blue box), without explaining how the tree structure constrains and guides the sequence merging process. The response lacks clarity on how the red module enforces parent-child dependencies and prevents sibling token interference, which is crucial for maintaining the tree structure. Additionally, it does not highlight the step-by-step interaction or the layered collaboration between the two modules, leaving the explanation overly vague and incomplete."

Question: What are the benefits of using channel-wise concatenation in the processing of [module highlighted by red bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: The benefits of using channel-wise concatenation in vision feature processing include achieving the best average performance, maintaining better throughput compared to sequence append, and offering performance, expandability, and efficiency. Relevant Paper Context: Section 2.4 We notice that existing popular fusion strategies, despite their variations in designs, can be broadly represented by the following several categories: (1) Sequence Append: directly appending the visual tokens from different backbones as longer sequence; (2) Channel Concatenation: concatenating the visual tokens along the channel dimension without increasing the sequence length; (3) LLaVA-HR: injecting high-resolution features into low-resolution vision encoders using mixture-of-resolution adapter; (4) Mini-Gemini: using the CLIP tokens as the low resolution queries to cross-attend another high-resolution vision encoder in the co-located local windows. Although sequence append shows comparable performance to channel concatenation, it faces the challenge to handle more vision encoders due to the increasing sequence length. Hence, we choose direct channel concatenation as our fusion strategy considering its performance, expandability, and efficiency. Fusion strategy: Qwen2-VL-72B: Channel-wise concatenation allows for the combination of features from different resolutions, which can improve the performance of the model.

Insights and Best Practices Figure Caption: The overview of our NASH framework, where we integrate both the neural architecture search (NAS) and coarse-to-fine accelerator search to directly obtain optimal pairing of models and accelerators. Specifically, the NAS consists of tailored zero-shot metric to pre-identify promising multiplication-reduce hybrid models before supernet training. Besides, the accelerator search involves novel coarse-to-fine search strategy to expedite the accelerator search process. Question: How does the [module highlighted by red bounding box] contribute to the efficiency of [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: The tailored zero-shot score contributes to neural architecture search efficiency by enabling faster assessment due to its swift computational speed. The computation of the tailored zero-shot metric is significantly faster than assessing the accuracy of individual hybrid models derived from the supernet, leading to enhanced search efficiency. Relevant Paper Context: Section 3.1 To enable more accurate assessment of our hybrid networks, we integrate two selected zero-shot metrics. Given the significant difference in score magnitudes between these metrics, as shown in Figures 3(b) and 3(c), we focus on relative rankings rather than score magnitudes. Specifically, for group of networks, the score of our tailored zero-shot metric for specific network is determined by the relative ranking of its Zen-Score within the group. For instance, if network exhibits the highest Zen-Score, its term yields value of 1. The effectiveness of our tailored metric is validated through Table II and Figure 3, which demonstrate the highest Kendall-Tau Correlation. Additionally, this metric contributes to enhanced search efficiency due to the swift computational speed of both NN-Degree and Zen-Score. For example, assessing accuracy for an individual hybrid model from our supernet takes an average of several seconds, whereas computing our tailored zero-shot metric requires less time, making it over times faster when tested on CIFAR100 and profiled on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti.

For video clip, DDIM inversion is applied to map the benign frames into the latent space. Timestep-wise Adversarial Latent Optimization is employed during the DDIM sampling process to optimize the latents. Throughout the whole pipeline, Recursive Token Merging and Recursive Token Unmerging Modules are integrated into the diffusion model to enhance its effectiveness. Additionally, structure loss is utilized to maintain the structural consistency of video frames. Ultimately, the resulting adversarial video clip is capable of deceiving the target model. Question: How does [module highlighted by red bounding box] interact with [module highlighted by blue bounding box] to enhance video consistency? Ground-truth Answer: Recursive Token Merging interacts with the Self Attention module by recursively matching and merging similar tokens across frames, enabling the Self Attention module to extract consistent features. This method ensures that the most similar tokens share identical outputs, which maximizes internal uniformity of features across frames and preserves temporal consistency, thereby enhancing video consistency. Relevant Paper Context: Section 3.3 TALO strategy perturbs each benign frame of video separately. This per-frame optimization makes the frames likely optimized along different adversarial directions resulting in motion discontinuity and temporal inconsistency. Furthermore, separately perturbing each benign frame reduces the monotonous gradients because the interactions among the frames are not exploited. To this end, we introduce recursive token merging (ReToMe) strategy that recursively matches and merges similar tokens across frames together enabling the self-attention module to extract consistent features. In the following, we first provide the basic operation of token merging and token unmerging and then our recursive token merging algorithm. Token Merging (ToMe) is first applied to speed up diffusion models through several diffusion-specific improvements. Generally, tokens are partitioned into source (src) and destination (dst) set. Then, tokens in src are matched to their most similar token in dst, and the most similar edges are selected subsequently. Next, we merge the connected most similar tokens in src to dst by replacing them with the linked dst tokens. To keep the token number unchanged, we divide merged tokens after self-attention by assigning their values to merged tokens in src. self-attention module takes sequence of input and output tokens across all frames. To partition tokens across frames into src and dst, we define the stride as B. We randomly choose one out of the first frames (e.g., the g-th frame) and select the subsequent frames every interval into the dst set. Recursive Token Merging: Qwen2-VL-72B: The module highlighted by the red bounding box, which is the Recursive Token Merging block, interacts with the module highlighted by the blue bounding box, which is the Self Attention block, to enhance video consistency. The Recursive Token Merging block merges tokens from adjacent timesteps, while the Self Attention block attends to the merged tokens to ensure that the information from different timesteps is consistent. This interaction helps to maintain the temporal coherence of the video frames. Error Analysis: Qwen2-VL-72Bs response oversimplifies the interaction between Recursive Token Merging (ReToMe) and the Self Attention module. While it correctly identifies their roles, it fails to emphasize how ReToMe recursively merges similar tokens across frames, ensuring temporal consistency and internal feature uniformity. This process mitigates per-frame inconsistencies in adversarial training, preserving structural coherence. The response lacks depth in explaining how ReToMe enhances adversarial effectiveness and video consistency beyond simple token merging. D.3 Reasoning error"

Question: What impact does incorporating [module highlighted by red bounding box] have on the predictions of [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: Incorporating physical constraint loss into LSTM block predictions enhances the accuracy and ensures physical consistency by making the model adhere to fundamental physical laws such as energy conservation, leading to more realistic prediction outcomes. Relevant Paper Context: Section 2.5: Energy conservation asserts that in conservative system, the total energy remains constant over time. This concept is particularly relevant in systems where external energy exchanges are absent. To quantify alignment with energy conservation principles, we define an energy conservation loss function, energy, which measures the discrepancy between the energy states of the input and output fields. This function is integrated into the overall loss function to enhance the adherence of the model to energy conservation. Physics Constraints: Qwen2-VL-72B: Incorporating the physical constraint loss has regularization effect on the predictions of the LSTM block. This is because the physical constraint loss ensures that the predictions made by the LSTM block are consistent with the underlying physics of the system being modeled. Error Analysis: Qwen2-VL-72Bs response lacks depth in its reasoning by overly simplifying the role of physical constraint loss as mere regularization.

Question: What role does [module highlighted by red bounding box] play in [module highlighted by blue bounding box]? Ground-truth Answer: The adaptive feature maximizer unifies feature distributions by utilizing encoded features from the Semantic Encoder and Diffusive Encoder, which undergo separate local and global feature extraction processes. It assigns weights based on feature relevance to facilitate the selection of mutually adaptive and effective shared representations, ultimately leading to more precise denoised target contrast. Relevant Paper Context: Section 3.4 BERT-based BiosERC architecture: Nevertheless, while multi-stage guidance proves beneficial in extracting valuable information from features at various levels, it is more challenging to maximize the mutual information between the conditional contrasts and the target MR contrast distributions. This is mainly due to intricate dependencies between multi-contrast imaging and finding more common and mutually adaptive feature representation.To overcome this challenge, we propose an adaptive feature maximize ( FM) within the denoising network, unifying feature distributions as shown in Fig. 1(C). The distinction between local and global feature contrasts derived from the denoising and conditional feature distributions aids in adaptively assigning weights to more pertinent features. This adaptive weighting facilitates the selection of mutually dependent and highly effective shared representations within the latent distribution. Consequently, these representations can be leveraged to achieve more precise denoised target contrast.

The Adaptive Feature Maximizer (FM) plays crucial role in guiding the Multi-contrast Synthesizer. Error Analysis: Qwens response overly relies on visual elements by merely identifying the red and blue boxes without explaining the functional relationship between FM and the synthesizer. It lacks deeper technical interpretation of FMs role in unifying feature distributions and guiding the synthesizer, failing to integrate the ground-truth context effectively. stronger response should focus on the adaptive weighting mechanism and its impact on contrast precision rather than just referencing colors."
