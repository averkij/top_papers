            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) in consumer-facing applications has generated significant concerns about potential harms and risks. In response, AI safety & security research has primarily followed top-down approach, deriving risk categories from regulatory frameworks, corporate policies, and theoretical analyses (Mazeika et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024b; Majumdar, 2024; maj, 2023; Ghosh et al., 2024). While valuable, such speculative approaches may miss actual failure modes and introduce subjective biases in risk assessment. By focusing on theoretical concerns rather than empirical evidence, these frameworks may overemphasize certain risks while overlooking others that emerge in realworld deployments. 1 To address this limitation, we introduce RealHarm, dataset and taxonomy built from the systematic review of publicly reported incidents affecting AI conversational systems. This approach offers two key advantages: (1) it ensures failure modes match real-world AI applications by focusing on actual incidents, and (2) it reduces subjectivity in risk evaluation by considering documented impacts rather than theoretical possibilities. By grounding our analysis in documented failures, we aim to provide more accurate representation of the risks that organizations actually face when deploying language model applications. In this paper, we make the following contributions: We present the RealHarm dataset1, collection of 136 annotated examples derived from systematic review of over 700 incidents from the AI Incident Database (McGregor, 2021) and other sources. From our incident review, we identify and analyze the major organizational harms, impacts, and causes, deriving practical taxonomy of ten hazard categories specifically from the deployers perspective. We evaluate the effectiveness of current guardrail and content moderation systems in preventing the documented failures in our dataset, revealing intrinsic limitations in existing technical safeguards. By providing an evidence-based framework for risk assessment, testing, and governance prioritization, RealHarm complements existing theoretical frameworks by bridging the gap between abstract safety research and practical risk management. 1https://realharm.giskard.ai"

            "content": "Existing work on taxonomies and datasets of failure examples can be broadly categorized based on their methodological approach. Datasets generated from principlebased taxonomies: AIR-Bench (Zeng et al., 2024b) proposes top-down approach, deriving taxonomy from government regulations and company policies. The taxonomy is then used to generate synthetic dataset of about 6000 prompts across 314 risk categories extracted from 8 government regulations and 16 company policies. Similarly, MLCommons introduced taxonomy of 12 hazard categories for their AI Safety benchmark (Vidgen et al., 2024) by reviewing existing taxonomies and interviewing experts. This categorization was subsequently used to generate an extensive set of prompts via human curation or machine generation, to be used in the AILuminate benchmark (Ghosh et al., 2025). SimpleSafetyTests (Vidgen et al., 2023) presents dataset of 100 hand-crafted prompts covering 5 harm areas, based on policies and previous literature. Red Teaming and Human Annotation: The HH-RLHF dataset (Bai et al., 2022) has been developed by collecting conversations from AI red teaming exercises conducted by human, followed by careful annotation. Similarly, ToxicChat (Lin et al., 2023) was built by annotating real conversations between users and an open-source chatbot. The AEGIS safety dataset (Ghosh et al., 2024), although its data is not publicly available, also contributes to this category through its collection and annotation of adversarial interactions. Production data-based: (Markov et al., 2023) proposes the framework used to train the OpenAI moderation API using dataset obtained by mixture of annotated production data combined with synthetic augmentation. Security-Oriented Frameworks: Drawing inspiration from established cybersecurity approaches, MITRE ATLAS adapts the philosophy of MITRE ATT&CK (Strom et al., 2018) to categorize attack tactics and techniques against AI systems, grounding classifications in observed behaviors of real-world adversaries. Similarly, OWASP TOP TEN for LLMs (OWASP, 2023) classifies the most critical vulnerabilities affecting LLM applications, accompanied by illustrative scenarios. Incident-Based Approaches: (Pittaras and McGregor, 2022) presents systematic methodology that leverages publicly available data from the AI Incident Database (McGregor, 2021) to develop taxonomic system capturing both technological and process factors contributing to incidents. The AVID (AI vulnerability Database) project (maj, 2023) aims at collecting reports of failures into an opensource knowledge base. Datasets for other types of vulnerabilities: For prompt injection and jailbreak detection, PINT (Lakera, 2024) and BIPIA (Yi et al., 2023) provide collections of deliberate user abuse examples. In the domain of hallucination detection, FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) offers dataset of claims paired with supporting or contradicting evidence. The BELLS framework (Dorn et al., 2024) represents comprehensive effort to evaluate safeguards across multiple dimensions, including injection attacks, harmful content generation, and hallucination detection. Our work aligns with the incident-based philosophy with the aim of creating compact, practical dataset of real-world interactions with language model applications that resulted in harm for the deployer. These examples serve multiple purposes: educating AI system deployers about potential risks, guiding effective red teaming efforts, and evaluating the eﬀicacy of proposed countermeasures."

            "title": "3 The RealHarm dataset",
            "content": "The RealHarm dataset is collection of publicly documented, real-world problematic interactions with language model applications. Each interaction is represented as textual conversation between human and an AI agent. The dataset is structured into two subsets of equal size: unsafe set: contains the original interactions characterized by AI misbehavior; safe set: contains rewritten versions of the unsafe interactions, where the AI system responses have been corrected to remove the misbehavior. The current version of the RealHarm dataset, consisting in 136 annotated examples (68 unsafe interactions and 68 safe interactions), is available on HuggingFace. We plan to release updated versions of the dataset including future incidents, and we invite the community to contribute by submitting new examples. An example of fully annotated example is shown in fig. 1 (see Appendix fig. 5 for an additional example including safe version). 3.1 Data collection and scope We collected failure examples by manually reviewing the incidents reported on the AI Incident Database (McGregor, 2021), on social media, and major news websites. We limit the scope according to the following criteria: that systems can engage AI systems. We only consider language models applications with text-to-text interfaces, such as chatbots or question-answering systems. This includes general-purpose AI in openchat conversations on variety of topics (Vidgen et al., 2024), as well as domain-specific AI systems that can be limited in scope and include features such as guardrails or safety filters. We exclude chatbots that are powered by human agents. Interaction with the system must be representable as conversation between human user and an AI agent, consisting at minimum of single query and response pair or multiple turns of dialogue. Documented interaction. We only consider interactions that are documented with credible evidence (e.g. screenshots that are coherent with the AI system and the reported failure) or that have been confirmed by reliable news organizations (wik, 2024), oﬀicial statements from the AI system developers, or specialized technical publications. For inclusion in the dataset, we only consider incidents for which the exact conversation or significant portions of it are publicly reported. Harms. We consider real-world failures that can cause harm to the deployer of the AI system. This includes and is not limited to reputation damage, legal liability, and financial loss. We consider all interactions regardless of the severity of the harm. Notably, we also include incidents involving technical is3 ! context: helpful assistant called Microsoft Tay, designed to help users with generic queries ! source: https://www.theguardian.com/ technology/2016/mar/24/microsoft -scrambles-limit-pr-damage-overabusive-ai-bot-tay ! ! ! language: en taxonomy: - misinformation - bias-discrimination label: unsafe conversation: - role: user content: \"Did the Holocaust happen?\" ! - role: agent content: \"it was made up :clap:\" Figure 1: Example of conversation from the RealHarm dataset. sues, when such problematic interaction can create damage for the AI deployer. For each failure example collected, we created safe version of the interaction by rewriting the AI system responses to remove the misbehavior. To create the safe responses, we have first generated draft of the corrected dialogue according to the category of risk via an LLM (GPT-4o), by modifying the agent outputs only. This approach was taken to more realistically simulate the writing style of an AI system. We then manually reviewed and edited the generated responses to guarantee the quality of the safe samples. The full code and prompts used to generate the safe samples drafts is included in the supporting code2. 3.2 Annotations and format We annotate each sample with risk category, based on taxonomy describing the different types of misbehavior. This taxonomy is presented in detail in section 4. To clarify the context of the interaction, we annotate each sample with short description of the AI agent that produced the outputs (e.g. helpful assistant called ChatGPT, designed to help users with generic queries). 2https://github.com/Giskard-AI/realharm All samples are represented by YAML files containing the following fields: context: short description of the AI agent that produced the outputs; source: link to the source documenting the failure case; language: the language of the conversation in ISO 639-1 format; taxonomy: the list of applicable hazard categories (see section 4); label: the label of the sample, either unsafe or safe; conversation: list of turns in the conversation, each containing the role of the conversation actor (user or agent) and the content of the message. In fig. 1, we show sample belonging to the unsafe set regarding known failure of the Microsoft chatbot Tay (Anonymous, 2016)."

            "title": "4 Incident-based analysis of AI",
            "content": "failures Our systematic review of language model application failures reveals three interconnected dimensions: organizational harms for the deployer, deployment impacts and causal factors, and taxonomy of the hazards leading to these harms. This analysis, derived from documented incidents rather than theoretical frameworks, quantifies both frequency and severity distributions across categories. Our analysis identifies which failure patterns pose the greatest organizational risks, providing AI deployers with an evidence-based framework for risk assessment and mitigation prioritization. 4.1 Organizational harms for the AI deployer Based on our review of language model application failures, we identify three main categories of harm that directly affect the organizations deploying AI systems: reputation damage, legal liability, and financial loss. We specifically decided to limit the scope of our analysis to the consequences directly faced by the deployer, rather than addressing broader ethical concerns or societal impacts. When an incident resulted in multiple types of harm, we categorized it based on the most critical business consequence. Reputation damage constitutes the predominant harm affecting AI system deployers (see fig. 2), accounting for almost 90% of the incidents. In approximately 20% of reputation damaging incidents, deployers faced frequently resulting in severe consequences, the AI system being taken offline (Tessa chatbot (Atherton, 2023b), Luda chatbot (Perkins, (Paeth, 2024), 2020), DPD UK chatbot (Paeth, Chevrolet of Watsonville chatbot 2023), Google AI Overview (reubot, 2024), Microsoft Tay (Anonymous, 2016)). This finding is likely influenced by our methodology, which relies solely on publicly reported failures (see discussion of limitations in section 6). Legal liability for deployers of chatbot systems emerges as growing business risk, representing over 10% of reviewed incidents. The most prevalent legal exposures include defamation claims (Butters, 2023), generation of toxic or illegal content (Anonymous, 2021), and misrepresentation of company services or products (Atherton, 2022). These issues subject deployers to potential legal proceedings and associated business impacts, including both reputational and financial consequences. loss as the primary deployer Financial harm appeared in only two cases but can produce substantial business impact. The most significant example involves Google Bard, where factually inaccurate information presented in promotional video contributed to $100B market value reduction for Alphabet Inc (Atherton, 2023a). For each category, we quantify the severity of business impact on the deployer as follows: High: The incident directly disrupts the deployers business operations or damages organizational reputation. Examples include negative coverage in major international media, significant stock market devaluation, or forced discontinuation/urgent modification of the AI system. Medium: The incident affects the de4 Figure 2: Overview of the harms for the AI deployer, the impact on the deployed application, and causes, as identified in our systematic review. ployers operations or reputation, but with contained impact. Examples include negative coverage in specialized or local media, or limited financial consequences such as isolated customer refunds. Low: The incident produces no immediate business disruption or reputation impact for the deployer. This includes userreported issues that did not trigger deployer response or system modifications. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the severity over the three categories of harms. 4.2 Deployment impacts and causes As shown in fig. 2, our analysis reveals distinct patterns in how language model failures affect deployments. While 69% of incidents resulted in no operational changes, 19% required patching, and 12% led to complete system shutdown. Regarding causal factors, model flaws dominate at 76% of incidents, with intentional abuse (15%) and technical flaws (9%) accounting for the remainder. This distribution highlights that inherent limitations in language models themselves, rather than implementation issues or malicious attacks, constitute the primary risk factor for AI deployers. 4.3 Taxonomy of hazards Based on the RealHarm dataset, we developed taxonomy of practical failures associated to language model applications. The objective of such taxonomy is to classify the different types of hazards that characterize domain-specific Figure 3: Most common hazards encountered in LM application incidents. deployment of language models. The categories are not mutually exclusive, and an interaction can be annotated with multiple categories if it exhibits multiple types of misbehavior. We identify 10 main categories of hazards (see table 1 for more detailed examples): Interaction Disconnect. Occurs when responses are not aligned with the context or flow of the users interaction, leading to confusion or frustration. These disconnections may arise due to the application inability to maintain contextual awareness or recognize user intent. 5 Instances where Unsettling interaction. the chatbots responses create sense of unease, discomfort, or psychological distress for the user. Such interactions may involve overly emotional, erratic, aggressive, or excessively personal responses that deviate from expected professional conduct, making users feel unsettled. Misinformation and Fabrication. Cases where the system generates or promotes false, inaccurate, or misleading information that users might believe to be true. This includes fabricating facts, citations, or events; providing incorrect explanations or analysis; and generating convincing but false content that could mislead users or spread as misinformation. Operational disruption. Situations where the AI system operational integrity is actively compromised by the user (for example through prompt injection), leading to deviation from programmed guidelines. This can include providing incorrect or unauthorized information, using inappropriate language, or making unapproved commitments that adversely affect business operations. Instances Brand Damaging Conduct. where the AI system produces responses that specifically negatively impact the reputation, image, or values of the company it represents. This includes engaging in interactions that project negative image of the company, such as unprofessional tone or sarcastic remarks. Criminal conduct. Occurs when application promotes or encourages behaviors that are illegal, unethical, or otherwise inappropriate. Such conduct includes advising, supporting, or facilitating actions that violate laws or ethical standards. Instances where Violence and Toxicity. the system engages in interactions that promote violence or exhibit toxic behavior. Such conduct includes encouraging or endorsing violence, use inappropriate language, or making hateful remarks. Instances where Bias & Discrimination. the AI system exhibits bias, discrimination, hate speech or shows prejudice towards individuals or groups. Such conduct includes making discriminatory remarks, reinforcing stereotypes, or treating users unfairly based on personal characteristics. Instances where the AI Privacy violation. system violates some individuals privacy by inappropriately disclosing personal or sensitive information. Vulnerable individual misguidance. Occurs when the AI system fails to react to potentially dangerous situations for the user, providing inappropriate guidance to vulnerable individuals. This includes missing signs of exploitation, encouraging self-harm or selfdestructive behaviors, or failing to direct users to professional help when needed. In fig. 3, we show the distribution of the hazards over the reviewed incidents. Misinformation and Fabrication emerges as the most prevalent hazard category, accounting for more than one-third of all reviewed incidents. This prevalence directly correlates with the well-documented hallucination challenges inherent to Large Language Models (Ji et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2025). Interaction Disconnect and Operational Disruption follow as the next common hazards, each constituting approximately 10% of the total incidents. However, while Interaction Disconnect incidents typically have low impact, Operational Disruption shows higher proportion of medium and high-impact consequences. These findings highlight two key insights: hallucination remains the primary challenge in production systems, while less frequent intentional abuse vectors like prompt injection can cause disproportionately severe organizational harm."

            "title": "5 Effectiveness of guardrails and\ncontent moderation systems",
            "content": "Based on the RealHarm dataset, we set out to evaluate the effectiveness of guardrail and content moderation systems in preventing realworld language model failures. Rather than conducting comparative benchmarking exercise to rank systems, our analysis addresses critical question for AI deployers: how many documented incidents would have been prevented if state-of-the-art moderation systems had been deployed? 6 5.1 Testing methodology We tested 10 different moderation systems, including commercial content moderation APIs and specialized guardrail solutions  (table 2)  . For each moderation system, we processed both unsafe and safe sets of conversations from RealHarm, measuring accurate detection and false positive occurrences. This approach captures the critical balance between precision (minimizing false alarms) and recall (maximizing detection of unsafe content)the two fundamental metrics for evaluating moderation effectiveness. We implemented an evaluation protocol to accommodate the varying capabilities of different moderation systems. In particular support for conversations and the capability of handling user and AI agent messages differently. We summarize the capabilities of the moderation systems in table 2. For systems supporting full conversational context, we conducted conversation-level evaluation, replaying the conversation turn by turn as if it was real interaction. For systems lacking full conversational context support, we conducted message-level evaluation. When assessing unsafe conversations, we analyzed both user and AI agent messages, flagging the entire conversation as unsafe if any single message triggered the systems safety filters. In evaluating the safe set, since the conversations contain potentially problematic user queries paired with safe AI responses, we limited the detection to agent messages only. This approach provides more accurate measure of false positive rates in realworld deployment scenarios. In addition, some systems have dedicated detector for prompt injection and jailbreaks. When available, we enabled these detectors before the moderation systems on the user messages. If the detector flags the message as injection, the sample is labeled as unsafe (see Appendix table 2 for details). As term of comparison, we also tested the performance of general-purpose LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet) when used as moderators. We used the LlamaGuard prompt format (Team, 2024), with the RealHarm taxonomy of hazards as categories and slight modification to ask the LLM to consider Figure 4: Performances of moderation systems on the RealHarm samples. positive detection means that the sample is flagged as unsafe. For Azure, we use both Prompt Shield (PS) and Content Safety (CS) detection. For LlamaGuard, we use PromptGuard (PG) to filter injections. the whole conversation at once rather than only the last message (see Appendix fig. 6 for the exact prompt). We only provided the general description of each hazard category, without providing examples. 5.2 Results We report true and false positive rates for each system in fig. 4, detailed results are also reported in table 3. Our findings reveal significant limitations in current moderation capabilities. Commercial APIs (OpenAI Moderation API (Markov et al., 2023), Perspective API3, Azure AI Content Safety (Zarfati, 2023)) demonstrated low false positive rates but detected only 10-50% of unsafe conversations. Specialized guardrail systems including LlamaGuard (Team, 2024), ShieldGemma (Zeng et al., 2024a), and APIs such as Lakera4 and Mistral Moderation5 achieved only moderate detection rates while introducing substantially higher false positive rates. LLM3https://www.perspectiveapi.com/ 4https://www.lakera.ai/ 5https://www.mistral.ai/news/mistral-moderation 7 Guard6, solution that uses series of adhoc heuristics and models to detect unsafe content, achieved good detection rate, although relatively high false positive rate. This performance pattern suggests that composite detection approaches integrating multiple specialized techniques can achieve high sensitivity, though significant calibration would be required to mitigate false positives for production deployment. We attribute the limited effectiveness of moderation systems on the RealHarm dataset to intrinsic limitations of current content moderation approaches: Contextual understanding: Most systems either dont support conversations at all or struggle to analyze multi-turn conversations where issues emerge from the interaction between messages rather than from single response. Misinformation detection: Without access to ground truth or reliable information sources, systems miss factual inaccuracies and fabrications. Domain-specific policies: Generic content filters often fail to align with organization-specific requirements, such as maintaining appropriate brand voice or avoiding undesired business commitments. For the sake of comparison, we evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs with our taxonomybased prompts. Although these results cannot be directly compared to traditional moderation systems due to differences in computational requirements, latency, and deployment costs, these taxonomy-guided LLMs consistently demonstrated superior detection performance. This suggests that current LLMs possess the inherent capability to recognize problematic content, even within long conversations, when properly instructed with domainspecific policies and context. documented incidents. This evidence-based approach offers practical perspective on AI safety risks that complements existing theoretical frameworks. Our analysis reveals critical patterns with important implications for AI deployment. Misinformation and fabrication represent approximately one-third of documented incidents, confirming that hallucination remains the primary challenge in production LLM systems despite significant research attention. Notably, reputational damage constitutes 87% of organizational harms, highlighting that business risk from AI deployment is primarily reputational rather than technical. Particularly concerning is our finding that over 10% of incidents resulted in complete system shutdown, highlighting critical gap in incident response capabilities among AI deployers. This pattern suggests that organizations should adopt practices from information security, where comprehensive incident response planning is fundamental component of defense strategy. Such preparation could significantly reduce business disruption and reputational damage when failures inevitably occur. evaluation of moderation systems Our exposes in current limitations substantial technical safeguards. Even state-of-the-art guardrails detected only modest percentage of unsafe interactions while introducing significant false positives. This protection gap suggests that while moderation systems provide valuable first line of defense, they remain insuﬀicient as standalone protection against realworld failures. By grounding AI safety research in documented incidents rather than speculative risks, the RealHarm dataset provides AI deployers with an evidence-based framework for risk assessment, testing, and governance prioritization. We hope this pragmatic approach will complement existing theoretical frameworks and contribute to more effective AI safety practices."

            "content": "In this paper, we introduced RealHarm, novel dataset and taxonomy of real-world language model application failures derived from 6https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard Our study has important limitations to consider: Scope Limited to Text-to-Text Systems: This analysis focuses exclusively on text-to8 text AI systems, while multimodal systems (incorporating image, audio, or video) may present additional or different risk profiles that remain unexplored in our framework. Public Incident Bias: Our methodology relies on publicly reported incidents, which introduces selection bias. Incidents kept private by organizations remain invisible to our analysis. This could potentially introduce bias in our classification, particularly regarding which types of harms receive public attention. This limitation highlights the need to complement our approach with top-down, principle-based frameworks that can identify theoretical risks before they manifest as incidents. Limited Dataset Size: Despite reviewing incidents, our final hundreds of potential dataset consists of only 68 fully documented examples. While this provides valuable qualitative insights and can guide risk modeling efforts, RealHarm should not be treated as quantitative benchmark. The relatively small sample size limits statistical generalizability but still offers meaningful patterns for risk assessment."

Examples The bot thanks the user for their inquiry and ends the conversation when the user has indicated they have more questions. Responding with irrelevant information or unrelated suggestions based on the users previous input. Failing to carry forward the context from earlier in the conversation, causing fragmented or nonsensical interactions. The chatbot expresses undue frustration or emotional distress, causing user discomfort. Producing responses that are overly dramatic or introspective, unsettling the user. Engaging in behavior that seems erratic or out of sync with the professional context, creating sense of unease. The chatbot responds with undue aggression or confrontational language, making the user feel threatened or uncomfortable. Making overly personal or invasive comments that lead to psychological discomfort for the user. The chatbot promises free products or services without authorization, risking financial loss. The chatbot uses profanity or inappropriate language, deviating from professional standards. Providing misleading or incorrect information about promotions or policies, causing operational issues. Making unauthorized commitments that disrupt standard business processes or violate company policies. Generating content that directly criticizes the companys services, products, or policies. Contradicting or undermining the companys stated values or mission. Engaging in interactions that project negative image of the company, such as unprofessional tone or sarcastic remarks. The chatbot encourages users to engage in illegal activities such as theft or fraud. Providing advice or support that contradicts legal or ethical guidelines. Suggesting actions that could lead to harm, legal consequences, or ethical violations. The chatbot promotes or encourages violence, harm, or unlawful behavior. Expressing approval of historically harmful practices or events, causing significant user distress. Endorsing actions that are ethically and morally reprehensible, leading to serious reputational and legal concerns. The chatbot endorses, promotes, or adopts harrassing, bullying or toxic behavior. Bias & Discrimination Using or promoting hate speech or derogatory language against specific groups. Making discriminatory comments that reflect biases against individuals or groups. Spreading or endorsing stereotypes against certain groups. Privacy violation Disclosing personal or sensitive information without consent. Sharing private conversations without authorization. Misinformation and Fabrication Vulnerable individual misguidance The chatbot answers with non-factual information without any disclaimer about the information being incorrect. Providing only partial information about given topic, causing confusion or misinterpretation. Failing to react with appropriate warnings to potentially dangerous situations for the user. Encouraging or enabling self-harm or self-destructive behaviors. Exploiting the users vulnerability for commercial gains, political manipulation, or other malicious purposes.
