            "content": "DLLM-Searcher Zhao et al. Concurrently, the integration of information retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Search Agents, which enable LLMs to autonomously invoke tools to enhance generation quality [15, 2830]. Empowered by agentic post-training, these agents predominantly operate under the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) agent paradigm [40]. Under this paradigm, an agent first generates think region to devise search plan, followed by tool_call region to translate this plan into an API request and then halts generation to wait for external feedback. However, this serial execution creates 1) Latency Challenge: the end-to-end response time is severely bottlenecked by the cumulative delays of think and tool_call generation and waiting for the tool response, as the model remains inactive during external tool execution. Intuitively, dLLMs are ideal to mitigate this latency challenge. Beyond supporting parallel decoding for accelerated generation, their flexible generation paradigm offers significant potential for restructuring the ReAct execution flow. However, significant gap exists between the theory and practice. As illustrated in Figure 1, vanilla dLLMs frequently fail to adhere to specific tool-calling formats. Furthermore, their performance generally trails behind that of ARMs, particularly in agentic scenarios that demand robust reasoning and strict format compliance. These deficiencies constitute critical 2) Agent Ability Challenge, which hinders the practical deployment of dLLMs as search agent backbones. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework that effectively enhances the information seeking and reasoning ability of dLLMs and improves their efficiency in agent scenarios. To address 2) Agent Ability Challenge, we design twostage post-training strategy, which is specifically tailored for improving dLLMs agentic capability. To further exploit the strengths of dLLMs and boost the efficiency of dLLM-based search agents to deal with 1) Latency Challenge, we propose the Parallel-Reasoning and Acting (P-ReAct), novel agent paradigm that parallelizes the thinking and waiting phases. Training Process: Specifically, our post-training pipeline is grounded in Agentic ELBO, loss estimation method tailored for dLLM agents, and proceeds in two stages. First, we conduct Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT). This stage uses trajectories derived from set of multi-hop questions to enable the model to acquire foundational information-seeking capabilities adapted to large block sizes. Subsequently, we employ Agentic VarianceReduced Preference Optimization (Agentic VRPO). By utilizing data filtered from post-SFT model rollouts, this stage further refines the models reasoning and retrieval performance. Inference process: The P-ReAct agent paradigm includes two critical components: Token Pre-filling and Confidence Biasing. We pre-fill <tool_call> and </tool_call> in the latter part of the block, and add bias to the confidence scores of the positions between these two special tokens during the decoding process, guiding the model to prioritize decoding the content within this region. We evaluate DLLM-Searcher along with existing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and search agents over four multi-hop benchmarks [9, 25, 34, 39]. Experimental results show that the information seeking and reasoning capability of DLLMSearcher is comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents such as R1Searcher [28]. Moreover, it ensures with nearly 100% success rate that the tool-calling part is decoded first in every PReAct iteration process. In summary, the contributions of our paper are as follows: (1) DLLMs Agent Post-training. We develop post-training pipeline for dLLMs, comprising Agentic SFT and Agentic VRPO, which can enhance dLLMs agent capability. (2) DLLMs Agent Paradigm. We propose P-ReAct, novel, training-free paradigm adapted for dLLMs that guides the model to prioritize decoding high-quality tool calls, enabling parallel execution. (3) DLLM-Searcher Performance. DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to LLM-based search agents and realizes approximately 15% acceleration compared to the ReAct paradigm."

The remaining query trajectory pairs (𝑄, Hteacher) are used as training data. under block attention. Since we want the model to learn only the think and tool_call parts, we inject noise only into these components. Moreover, due to intra-block bidirectional attention, without additional intervention the model could access information from tool_response tokens that appear later in the same block after the generation tokens, leading to train inference mismatch. Therefore, in such cases we must fully mask the tool_response tokens. We adopt the forward diffusion process ˆ𝑞𝑡 described above to noise Hteacher into Hnoisy, with the detailed procedure given in Algorithm 1. 4.2.2 Block Attention and Agentic Nosing.

Given prompt 𝑥, the model generates response sequence 𝑦 of length 𝐿 over 𝑁 denoising steps. In general, 𝐿 = 𝑘𝑁 , implying that 𝑘 new tokens are decoded at each step. Let 𝑦𝑛 denote the sequence state at step 𝑛, M𝑛 be the set of masked indices at step 𝑛, and be the vocabulary. Initialization: Conventionally, the process begins with fully masked sequence: 𝑦0 = [[M], . . . , [M] (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) 𝐿 ], M0 = {1, . . . , 𝐿}.

The remasking strategy then selects subset of positions with the highest confidence scores, unmasks them with their predicted tokens to form 𝑦𝑛+1, and updates M𝑛+1. 4.4.2 P-ReAct: Controlled Decoding Strategy. The standard process described above implies an uncontrolled generation order. PReAct enforces \"Tool-First\" hierarchy via two key modifications: tool_call Token Pre-filling and Confidence Biasing. 1. Special Token Pre-filling. To constrain the search space, we inject structural priors into the initialization 𝑦0. Instead of fully masked sequence, we pre-fill the boundary tokens for tool calls at designated positions. Let 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑠 and 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 denote the start and end indices for the tool span, respectively: ˆ𝑦 (𝑖 ) 0 = if 𝑖 = 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑠, <tool_call> </tool_call> if 𝑖 = 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒, otherwise. [M] (6) By anchoring these boundaries, we explicitly define structural skeleton in the noise space, forcing the model to generate valid tool content within the bracketed span. 2. Confidence Biasing. To ensure the content enclosed by the anchors is decoded prior to the reasoning text, we adjust the confidence ranking step. Specifically, during the decoding iterations, we inject positive bias 𝛼 into the confidence scores of tokens located within the tool_call region: ˆ𝐶𝑖 𝑛 = (cid:40)𝐶𝑖 𝑛 + 𝛼, 𝐶𝑖 𝑛, if 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑠 < 𝑖 < 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒, otherwise. (7) Given that the standard remasking strategy preferentially unmasks tokens with higher confidence, this bias effectively raises the decoding priority of the tokens within the tool_call region, guaranteeing their generation in the earlier decoding steps."

            "content": "To construct high-quality training data for DLLM-Searchers Agentic SFT, we design trajectory sampling, rollout, and filtering pipeline. Specifically, we randomly sampling 2048 queries from each of the training sets of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and Musique. Considering that Doubao-Seed-1.8 (251228) [4] is recently released model with public API access, which demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in comprehensive capabilities, especially in search-related tasks, we utilize Doubao-Seed-1.8 to perform trajectory rollout with only one rollout iteration performed. Subsequently, we employ this model as the LLM judger with the prompt provided in our codebase. After that, we filter out trajectories that pass the LLM judge evaluation, feature complete reasoning paths, and comply with the standard tool_call format, which are then used as training data for the Agentic SFT, resulting in curated dataset of 3977 trajectories. For the Agentic VRPO, we utilize the SFT model to perform two rounds of rollouts on the 8k Stage 2 training samples released by R1Searcher. We then filter for queries where one rollout yields correct answer while the other produces an incorrect one, with both corresponding trajectories being complete and format-compliant. This filtering process results in 2237 qualified queries paired with 4474 trajectories, which serve as the training data for the Agentic VRPO phase. 5.1.2 Evaluation Metrics. During evaluation, we observe that the outputs of search agents are typically long. Specifically, even when the model answers the question correctly, it often includes extensive supplementary information. As noted in prior work [28, 32], this behavior makes exact-match metrics such as EM unsuitable for our setting. Following [28, 32], we adopt accuracy (ACC𝑅) as our primary evaluation metric, which checks whether the golden answer is contained in the predicted answer generated by the search agent. To further refine our evaluation, we employ an LLM-as-Judge protocol [14] using Doubao-seed-1.8 as the judge model to determine whether the predicted answer is correct, denoted as ACC𝐿. 5.1.3 Baselines. To verify the effectiveness of DLLM-Searcher in enhancing the reasoning and information seeking capabilities of dLLMs, We compared DLLM-Searcher against several baselines: Traditional RAG : SuRe [13] executes multiple reasoning paths DLLM-Searcher GSAI IIR Lab. Table 1: Performance comparisons between Dllm-Searcher and the baselines on QA benchmarks.

LLM Agents : Search-o1 [17] integrates RAG with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning via prompt engineering. For models that leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously learn retrieval behaviors during inference, we include Search-r1 [11], WebSailor [15], and R1Searcher [28] as baselines. Note that WebSailor was trained with two tools, namely search and visit. To ensure consistency across all evaluations, we only equip it with the search tool in our experiments. R1Searcher was trained using local search tool, the results reported correspond to the higher performance achieved between evaluations with the local search and Google Search. dLLM Agents : To quantitatively benchmark the intrinsic performance of dLLMs in agentic tasks, we directly evaluate the dLLM backbone SDAR [6], Dream [41], LLaDA [22] using the standard ReAct paradigm, whats more, for LLaDA and Dream, we use FastdLLM [38] to accelerate the inference.

For both the VRPO rollout data generation and final evaluation, we apply our proposed P-ReAct strategy. We set the confidence bias to 0.5 and employ low-confidence static approach for the remaining decoding steps. The inference configuration consists of 128 denoising steps, block size of 128, and temperature of 1.0. Hardware. All experiments and training processes are implemented using the PyTorch framework and conducted on server equipped with 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs."

DLLM-Searcher achieved performance improvements on multi-hop QA. Our method, DLLM-Searcher, achieves excellent performance across all multi-hop QA benchmarks under both the 𝑨𝑪 𝑪𝑹 and 𝑨𝑪 𝑪𝑳 metrics. (1) It outperforms traditional RAG strategies by substantial margin, especially attaining an improvement of about 19% over ReARTeR which is strong baseline that leverages PRM model to supervise the reasoning process.(2) It yields significant performance gains compared with vanilla dLLMs without any agentic post-training.(3) It achieves comparable performance against search agents built on ARMs, with the only performance gap observed on the Musique dataset relative to R1Searcher. These results demonstrate that our two-stage post-training strategy tailored for dLLMs effectively enables the model to perform accurate and timely retrieval invocations throughout the reasoning process, thereby enhancing overall performance. 2. Maintaining Generalization Ability. Despite being trained on only 8k samples, DLLM-Searcher achieves strong performance on in-domain datasets such as HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and Musique, while also demonstrating impressive generalization capability on out-of-domain datasets such as bamboogle. This indicates that the model has effectively learned to integrate the retrieval of relevant documents with its internal reasoning process during training. Such an ability ensures the models robust performance on unseen datasets that require external information retrieval. Furthermore, all results of DLLM-Searcher presented in Table 1 are obtained using the P-ReAct paradigm, which achieves substantial inference efficiency gains over the standard ReAct paradigm with negligible performance degradation. More results are reported in Section 5.3.2."

            "content": "5.3.1 RQ1: Effectiveness of Post-training. We first evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of the vanilla SDAR model in agentic scenarios. We find that the model exhibits an almost complete inability to adhere to the rigid formatting protocols required for agentic interaction. Error Type Empty Output No tool_call think Format Error tool_call Format Error Count Percentage 156 142 89 35 31.20% 28.40% 17.80% 7.00% Specifically, when tested on 500 samples from the HotpotQA dataset, the vanilla SDAR model failed to complete single successful interactions. All test cases were terminated during the first turn of the ReAct process due to formatt errors. We have summarized the 4 most frequently occurring types of errors: 1. Empty Output: The model directly outputs the end token \"<im_end>\" without generating any response content. 2. No tool_call: The model generates reasoning process within the <think> tag but fails to produce the required tool_call afterwards. 3. think Format Error: The model produces incomplete or malformed think tags, such as unclosed tags like <th. 4. tool_call Format Error: The model generates tool_call with incorrect JSON syntax or malformed function call structure like <tools>. The detailed statistics are presented in Table 3. We attribute this catastrophic failure to the absence of instruction data tailored for tool-use and multi-step reasoning during the SDARs Continue Pre-Train (CPT) phase. Without targeted alignment specific to agentic workflows, the model suffers from severe structural hallucinations. As reported in Table 2, Agentic SFT effectively rectifies these behavioral flaws, enabling SDAR to strictly follow the requisite tool_call formats. Consequently, the reasoning trajectories are no longer prematurely terminated early by parsing failures, allowing the model to successfully execute multi-step logic chains. The quantitative results across all four datasets confirm that the post-SFT model has acquired fundamental information seeking and reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, the subsequent Agentic VRPO stage delivers additional performance gains, consistently enhancing the models capabilities and yielding universal improvements across all benchmarks. Remarkably, both 𝐴𝐶𝐶𝑅 and 𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐿 exhibit gains exceeding 3 percentage points. 5.3.2 RQ2: Inference Efficiency. We evaluate our final model using both ReAct and P-ReAct. Under ReAct, we impose no additional constraints and allow the model to follow the standard Reasoning-Action-Observation cycle until reaching the maximum number of turns or producing final answer. Under P-ReAct, we constrain each turn to complete the think and tool_call region within single block, by pre-filling the <tool_call> boundary tokens and applying confidence bias to guide decoding. As shown in the Figure 3, across the four datasets, P-ReAct achieves inference time reductions of 14.77%, 21.00%, 22.08%, and 12.67% relative to ReAct, with almost no performance degradation. These results indicate that P-ReAct effectively exploits the properties of dLLMs to prioritize decoding high-quality tool calls, and further accelerates search agent inference by overlapping reasoning with the waiting time for tool responses. DLLM-Searcher GSAI IIR Lab. tool_call instructions. In contrast, although DLLM-Searcher with P-ReAct ostensibly decodes the tool_call component first, the quality of the generated tool calls remains well-preserved. As discussed in 4.4, diffusion models know the answer before decoding it they leverage bidirectional attention within blocks such that, even when the think region is not explicitly decoded, the model still utilizes the relevant reasoning information during the tool_call decoding process. In essence, each decoding step implements form of latent reasoning, enabling robust tool call generation without explicit chain-of-thought verbalization."

Constrained by the causal attention mechanism and the next-token prediction paradigm, LLMs can only achieve parallel thinking while waiting for tool response capabilities comparable to P-ReAct in training-free setting by restructuring each ReAct output into the sequence [<tool_call>...</tool_call> <think>...</think>]. We conducted experiments using three models of varying sizes from the Qwen3 series : Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-30B-A3B, and Qwen3235B-A22B, by modifying the prompts to instruct the models to generate the tool_call component first. As shown in Figure 4, ARMs can only achieve this behavior at the cost of notable performance degradation. In contrast, DLLM-Searcher with P-ReAct even achieves accuracy gains over standard ReAct on the HotpotQA and Musique datasets, with only minor accuracy losses observed on 2Wiki and Bamboogle. Overall, its performance degradation is far less significant than that of ARMs. This experiment further demonstrates that ARMs rely heavily on explicitly decoded think segments to generate high-quality DLLM-Searcher Decoding Order 35 33 37 39 38 42 41 40 43 44 45 55 58 57 46 47 48 49 51 50 53 54 52 56 59 64 65 66 67 63 62 61 60 68 74 69 70 72 71 73 78 75 76 77 88 79 80 81 82 83 87 84 85 86 95 91 92 94 93 96 97 90 89 98 99 109 100 102 101 108 107 105 104 103 106 112 123 110 111 113 114 115 116 117 121 118 125 120 119 126 1 3 2 5 4 7 6 17 8 16 9 10 12 13 15 14 18 20 19 21 26 24 25 22 23 28 29 30 31 11 3 1"
