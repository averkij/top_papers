            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Visual question answering (VQA) (Antol et al., 2015; Goyal et al., 2017; Agrawal et al., 2018) has emerged as common benchmark for image understanding in VLMs. Recent state-of-the-art models achieve surprisingly strong results on established VQA datasets (Li et al., 2023b; Yu et al., 2024), suggesting that basic forms of visual understanding might already be solved. In turn, several benchmarks have shifted from generic image understanding towards the probing of domain-specific knowledge (Yue et al., 2024; Phan et al., 2025). However, have todays VLMs really solved core vision tasks? We argue that current benchmarks are poor indicators of this, as most of them fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications, where safety and reliability depend on fine-grained perception in dense and high-resolution scenes. Current benchmarks instead emphasize simple foreground reasoning (Li et al., 2023b; 2024b; Yu et al., 2024) or needle-in-a-haystack-like retrieval tasks (Wu & Xie, 2024; Li et al., 2023a; Shi et al., 2025), falling short of testing such capabilities, and potentially overestimating performance. Instead, we expect that model performance will severely drop under pressure, and modulate this through the angle of visual complexity and densevisually overloadedscenes. We motivate our analysis by suggesting that the vision encoder is bottleneck in modern VLMs. Encoders are designed to compress visual input into fixed number of tokens, retaining only the most salient features. This design imposes an inherent upper bound on fine-grained perception: for instance, ViT-L/14@336px encoder maps 3362 3 pixels into just 1024 tokens, inevitably discarding information. While random noise illustrates an extreme case of this, we expect sufficiently densely populated scenes to already trigger these limits. To verify our expectations, we introduce new dataset explicitly designed to probe image understanding in dense and high-resolution scenes. Our dataset comprises 150 high-resolution scans of artworks featuring highly dense scenes, along with 2,720 manually curated questionanswer pairs spanning six fundamental tasks of visual comprehension: activity recognition, attribute recognition, counting, optical character recognition (OCR), visual reasoning, and global scene classification (see Fig. 1 for an example). Unlike prior benchmarks that recycle existing image datasets, all of our images are newly sourced from public domain artworks, resulting in fresh source of data free of copyright concerns. Our empirical study of 37 VLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models, while often competent at global scene classification, consistently struggle in fine-grained recognition in dense scenes. To better characterize these challenges, we split our benchmark into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), calibrated by average model performance. Even the strongest model we tested (o3) achieves only 19.6% accuracy on the hardest split and 69.5% overall, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark and the underlying challenge. Finally, we conduct detailed error analysis and uncover striking failures: for instance, we observe strong failures in counting tasks for high ground-truth values and in OCR tasks requiring precise textual recognition, such as the recognition of typos. Furthermore, we observe that models frequently provide logically inconsistent answers to logically opposite paired questions, with this instability intensifying as the complexity of such queries increases. Such inconsistencies sometimes even degrade performance to random or even sub-random baselines, suggesting that these models rely heavily on shortcuts rather than robust reasoning. Taken together, these findings highlight the urgent need for benchmarks like ours that reflect the realities of dense, high-resolution perception and reveal fundamental limitations of current VLMs. We summarize our contributions as follows: We introduce new benchmark for VQA in dense, high-resolution (visually overloaded) scenes. Our benchmark contains 2,720 manually curated questionanswer pairs across six fundamental categories (activity recognition, attribute recognition, counting, OCR, visual reasoning, and global scene classification) as described in Sec. 2. Ground truths are held private to avoid target leakage. All images are sourced entirely from public domain artwork collections to provide fresh image dataset free of copyright issues. We evaluate range of state-of-the-art models in Sec. 3 and show that, while they perform well on global scene classification, they struggle significantly in fine-grained understanding 2 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 in dense settings, particularly for counting and OCR. We provide three-level difficulty split, calibrated by average model performance, showing that even the strongest tested model (o3) reaches only 19.6% accuracy on the hardest split. We perform detailed error analysis in Sec. 4, uncovering systematic inconsistencies and shortcut biases that further hinder robust performance in visually overloaded settings."

            "content": "Our goal is to create benchmark that tests basic image recognition skills that we expect to be present in any frontier models. However, unlike many previous benchmarks, we design our benchmark around fine-grained recognition in dense scenes to stress test the vision encoders representation.

            "title": "2.1 DATASET CURATION",
            "content": "Image collection. We collected 150 high-resolution digitizations of paintings, curated from collections held by museums around the world and made available through Google Arts & Culture. We specifically selected paintings that depict visually complex scenes densely composed narratives filled with numerous figures, actions, and subplots, often unfolding simultaneously within richly detailed environments. While complexity is hard to quantify, we picked artworks that tend to overwhelm the eye and demand significant time and attention to fully absorb their intricate details, as rule of thumb. We only selected paintings in the public domain, i.e., artworks where the original creators passed away more than 100 years ago. Due to the inherent complexity of the scenes, the images in the dataset are typically of extreme resolution and exceed 4K resolution (3840 2160 pixels). To standardize the dataset, we downsampled all images to match the nearest total pixel count of 4K while preserving their original aspect ratios. 28 images were originally below 4K resolution and were therefore not downsampled; however, all remain above Full HD resolution (1920 1080 pixels). Question annotation. Six human annotators manually annotated the resized images with questions and answer options. The annotators were instructed to generate questions that are clearly formulated and specific, leaving no ambiguity about the information being requested. To avoid language priors, the questions are also explicitly mandated to be grounded in the content of the accompanying image and should not be answered from text alone (Zhang et al., 2016; Goyal et al., 2017; Agrawal et al., 2016; 2018; Cadene et al., 2019). In addition, we restricted questions to probe for details that can be directly observed or reasonably inferred from the image, excluding any questionanswer pairs based on beliefs or subjective interpretations. Finally, we requested questions to be solvable without external or expert knowledge beyond basic level of everyday world knowledge, as we are only concerned with image understanding in this work. We employ two answer formats: multiple-choice and freeform. Multiple-choice questions either offer four options, where only one correct answer or are binary yes/no questions. We pair each of the latter kind of questions with logical opposite (e.g., \"Is it day?\" and \"Is it night?\") (Zhang et al., 2016). This not only helps calibrate against random guessing but also provides an additional signal for identifying logical inconsistencies in generated responses (see Sec. 4). For selected tasks, we use freeform answers to raise the level of difficulty (see below). Our annotated questions each fall into one of the following six categories, resulting in approximately 18 questions per image: Activity recognition (N = 150): multiple-choice questions about actions or activities occurring in the scene. These questions will refer to single or group of subjects, typically paired with constraint. For instance, \"What is the person dressed in brown at the front of the table in the leftmost house doing?\". Attribute recognition (N = 149): multiple-choice queries about the color attribute of objects are typically paired with constraint probing for spatial, attribute, or activity recognition. For instance, \"What is the color of the left-most ship flag?\". 3 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Counting (N = 559): freeform inquiries about details that involve determining the number of objects present. The questions may be related to the entire scene or spatially constrained, requiring mild visual reasoning to provide correct answer. For instance, \"How many roses are lying on the floor?\". OCR (N = 118): freeform queries about written text in the image. Languages include English, Latin, Chinese, Dutch, and Greek. Some questions are specified to probe for parts of the text, which can be seen as mild form of text reasoning, e.g., \"What is the last name of the signature?\", or require some minimal visual reasoning efforts, e.g., \"What does the word below the main character read?\". Reasoning (N = 356): multiple-choice queries that require medium to high load of visual reasoning to be answerable. In principle, we expect that \"chain of thought\" is necessary to provide correct answer. For instance, these questions may require functional or intent understanding, distance or path estimation, lightor wind-source estimation, occupancy detection, and numerical comparisons based on the images content. Some example questions are: \"Do you have to cross the water to reach the two windmills on the right?\", \"I am allergic to seafood, is all of the food on the table safe for me?\", or \"Does capital punishment appear to be legal in this scene?\". Scene classification (N = 1388): multiple-choice queries about the overall scene or setting of the image. These questions typically do not require fine-grained understanding or complex visual reasoning of the scene, and we expect all models to perform well on them. Yet, we still observe that some models struggle with them. For instance, \"Are there animals in the scene?\". Quality control. After annotation, we evaluated 37 VLMs on our dataset and manually verified the correctness of ground truths if the question was only solved by small number of models. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 3 of the strongest models from our leaderboard (InternVL3-38B, Qwen2.5-VL 32B, LLaVA-OV 72B) on our dataset while ablating the image to probe for hidden biases due to linguistic cues in the question or answer options of multiple-choice questions. We detected number of questions where all 3 models were able to answer the question without seeing the image. We then prompted Gemini 2.5 Pro to detect language biases in each question (see Sec. A.3 for the prompt) and removed instances with severe biases, such as cases where the correct answer was an oddity or was implied by the context of the question. Please note that this is not necessary for freeform answers (counting, OCR) or binary questions, which are self-balanced by their logical opposites. The final blind performance on the remaining questions is shown in Tab. 1. Overall, our quality control resulted in reduction of blind performance to near chance baselines for most tasks. However, we still observe elevated performance for the attribute recognition and counting tasks. These gains stem primarily from statistical irregularities in the distribution of ground-truth answers (e.g., small object counts being more frequent). Such distributional priors are unavoidable in real-world datasets and do not confer generalizable shortcut that undermines evaluation. In practice, models must still extract and process visual content to achieve strong performance on all of our tasks. Difficulty splits. We divide our questions into three difficulty levelseasy, medium, and hardbased on model performance in Sec. 3. The thresholds are defined by the percentage of correct responses: [0, 20] for hard, (20, 90) for medium, and [90, 100] for easy."

For binary questions, we measure pair-wise accuracy, and score pair as correct if both questions are correct, and false otherwise. Answer extraction. Although our prompts aim to constrain output format, VLMs do not always follow these instructions. To address this, we apply simple heuristic-based preprocessing to extract and normalize responses across tasks. For multiple-choice questions, we detect the option letter and map it to the corresponding label, or directly match the label when possible. For counting questions, we extract either numeral or 4 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 1: Blind benchmark results.

Evaluation server. To prevent test leakage into future VLMs, we hold out the ground truth and only release the image samples and questions. We do not provide development split, as our tasks do not require any specialized knowledge or skills, and we expect decent foundational vision models to solve these tasks without finetuning. Instead, we provide an evaluation server that scores generated answers and maintain an opt-in leaderboard of those. Evaluations are made by submitting JSON file with model predictions to our public evaluation server. The server applies our extraction heuristics as outlined above, but users are free to apply their own preprocessing of any kind before submitting their predictions. We rate-limit the server per user and day to prevent ground-truth extraction attacks."

            "content": "Existing VQA benchmarks underestimate the true difficulty of visual reasoning. They rely on lowresolution images, recycled content, and automatically generated questions that encourage shallow pattern matching rather than genuine scene understanding. Our benchmark is intentionally designed to correct these shortcomings and to set higher standard for evaluation. Its distinguishing features are: High-resolution, dense images. We collect detailed images of complex scenes, enabling questions that demand fine-grained perception and long-range reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, which often reduce vision to global features, our dataset forces models to engage with the full richness of the scene. Manual annotation. All questions are crafted by human annotators. Automated pipelines used in other datasets may scale cheaply, but they also introduce biases, trivial patterns, and low-quality queries. Our human-centered approach ensures natural, challenging, and unbiased evaluation. Fresh image data. Rather than recycling existing dataset sources, we provide entirely new images. This prevents leakage from pretraining corpora and eliminates the domain biases that plague benchmarks built from reused datasets. Public domain licensing. Every image is sourced from the public domain, removing legal barriers that limit distribution or usage. Unlike benchmarks with restrictive or unclear licensing due to web crawling, ours is openly and universally accessible. In sum, where existing benchmarks compromise on difficulty, reliability, or ethics, our dataset sets new bar: more challenging, more trustworthy, and more responsible. It is not simply another addition to the landscape, but necessary corrective to the limitations of current VQA evaluation."

To simplify the answer extraction, we add small postfixes to the benchmark questions outlined in Sec. A.1. We generate answers using greedy decoding for all models, except for proprietary models and models where greedy decoding failed to generate useful outputs (e.g., Llama 4), as highlighted in the result tables. Additionally, we compare the results to random chance (we assume no priors for counting and OCR), as well as consistent chance, where we assume that model is guessing, but gives consistent guesses for logically opposite questions."

            "title": "3.2 MAIN RESULTS",
            "content": "The results in Tab. 2 show vast differences between models and some of the tasks in VisualOverload. First off, we notice that all models struggle with our freeform counting and OCR tasks. The best accuracy in counting is achieved by Gemini 2.0 Flash, but is only at 41.7%. OCR performance is overall better, but even the best model, o4-mini only achieves 62.7%. This is also the task with the highest discrepancy between proprietary commercial models and open-weight ones. For activity and attribute recognition, we see an improved accuracy (yet, also higher random chance), but still far from satisfactory performance even with the strongest models. For reasoning tasks, we find that almost all models struggle and make rather small improvements compared to the consistent random chance, while some of the smaller models even underperform it. The only positive outlier here is o3, which achieves significant advantage compared to other models, presumably due to its reasoning mode. Unsurprisingly, we find that frontier models achieve high accuracy on scene understanding, as it primarily relies on superficial understanding of the scenes, as is common in many of the existing VQA datasets. However, rather surprisingly, the task can still be challenging for many other models, even for large models. Yet, 8B parameters seem already to be sufficient to achieve 93.4%. In few cases, the accuracy even fell below consistent chance, suggesting fallback to shortcut features (see also Sec. 4). Averaged over all tasks, the best model (o3) achieves only 19.6% on the hardest test split, and 69.5% overall. The strongest open-weight model is InternVL3 38B with 7.2% and 67.6%, respectively. Interestingly, we found that specialized HD models perform significantly worse than equally sized regular models. We attribute this primarily to the fact that most VLMs apply methodologies such as AnyRes (Liu et al., 2024a) to support high-resolution images and, thus, performance is rather dependent on the backbones and training, therefore showing that modern VLMs outperform specialized VLMs built on older backbones1. Finally, we also find some counter-intuitive scaling trends, where performance decreases with parameter size (often for the largest model of the family, i.e., in InternVL3 and PaliGemma 2). We encourage the community to explore advanced prompting techniques and invite them to submit these to our leaderboard."

With the protection of our private ground-truth in mind, we will rely on average statistics over all models described in Sec. 3.1. Counting. To analyze errors in counting tasks, we plot the distribution of predictions versus ground truths in Fig. 2a. Models are generally accurate when the ground truth is low, but errors increase substantially as the ground truth rises. Although some errors stem from incorrect predictions, many are also due to refusals (which we treat as 0) or blank responses (e.g., too many objects to count). In all cases, models tend to err on the low side and underestimate the ground truth. Yet, our analysis also contained outliers showing severe overestimation. 1Please find an ablation of performance under different resolutions of VisualOverload in Sec. A.2. 6 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 Table 2: Benchmark results.

(b) Accuracy under tolerance (meanstd). Figure 2: Insights into counting errors. All analyses display distributions over all model predictions exclusively for the counting task. To quantify the magnitude of these errors, we measured accuracy under varying tolerance levels, shown in Fig. 2b. Prediction errors are typically severe: even with 10% tolerance, average accuracy improves by only 1.6%. Larger tolerances, such as 50% or 100%, yield more substantial improvements, but such levels are impractical for real-world applications. OCR. Similar to counting, we aim to quantify the magnitude of errors in OCR predictions. To do this, we measure the Levenshtein edit distance (Levenshtein, 1965) between preprocessed predictions (as described in Sec. 2.2) and ground truths for incorrect answers. We normalize the distance by the maximum sequence length and visualize the distribution in Fig. 3. The distributions center of mass is around 0.7, indicating that sequences require substantial edits to be correct, highlighting severe errors. Manual inspection of subset of errors reveals three main causes: hallucinations, extraction of irrelevant text, and, in few severe cases, failure to follow the instruction to respond only with the text. Errors of the second type often arise from misinterpretation of text flow, such as side-by-side multi-line paragraphs or non-standard layouts like banners. For errors with low edit distance, we frequently observe that models autocorrect spelling or generally fall back to more probable token sequences rather than reproducing the actual text (e.g., accidunt becomes accident), particularly in non-English or non-Latin scripts. Figure 3: OCR prediction error distance. Logical Consistency. As described in Sec. 2.1, our dataset contains binary questions, where each such question is paired with logically opposite. strong model should argue logically consistently, even if the answer is wrong. For instance, if model answers yes to Is it day? it should answer no to Is it night?. We measure the ratio of logically consistent answer pairs per model and task (reasoning and global scene understanding) and visualize the results in Fig. 4. We observe that frontier models answer fairly logically consistent for the easier scene questions, but their performance rapidly drops on the harder reasoning questions. On average, consistency falls from 83.3% or 60.6% between the tasks. For some models, well-above-chance consistency drops near-random baseline for reasoning, suggesting that models are now guessing independently of the context, while providing well-grounded answers on the original task. In some cases, we also find well-below random chance consistency, suggesting that the model is relying on shortcuts for shortcuts rather than the visual inputs. Alarmingly, we find PaliGemma2 3B to be susceptible to these for both tasks. Figure 4: Logical consistency. 8 Published as conference paper at ICLR"

            "content": "Large Multi-Modal Models. Recent progress in VLMs has significantly advanced the integration of visual and linguistic modalities, enabling more sophisticated multi-modal understanding and generation. Early approaches connect pretrained vision encoders with large language models via lightweight modules, achieving competitive performance with relatively few trainable parameters (Li et al., 2023c; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). The LLaVA series (Liu et al., 2023b;a; 2024a; Li et al., 2024a) improves visual instruction tuning, demonstrating stronger performance on fine-grained visual tasks. More recent models extend these capabilities to multi-image contexts, enabling richer scene understanding and more coherent textual reasoning (Li et al., 2024a; Steiner et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2025; Gemma Team, 2025). Proprietary VLMs, including GPT and the o-series (OpenAI, 2024; 2025), and Gemini (Gemini Team, 2024; 2025), further highlight progress in versatile, context-aware multimodal learning frameworks, sometimes even including multi-modal reasoning (OpenAI, 2025). Despite these advancements, many VLMs still exhibit notable weaknesses in visual understanding. Prior work has shown that they struggle with counting (Paiss et al., 2023), spatial reasoning, concept binding, and dense scene understanding (Doveh et al., 2023a;b; Huang et al., 2024; Campbell et al., 2024), as well as detailed image classification tasks (Mirza et al., 2025; 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b). In our work, we build on these findings by introducing benchmark of densely populated public-domain paintings, designed to probe such vulnerabilities and evaluate the capacity of VLMs to perform basic visual tasks in challenging, visually overloaded scenes. Multi-Modal Vision Benchmarks. The rapid progress of VLMs has spurred surge of benchmarks evaluating their ability to integrate vision and language across tasks such as VQA, captioning, reasoning, and instruction following. Extending classic VQA datasets (Antol et al., 2015; Goyal et al., 2017), modern benchmarks vary in scope, from real-world instruction following in VisitBench (Bitton et al., 2023) to conversational reasoning in LLaVA-Bench (Bordes et al., 2024), zero-shot capability assessment across 16 capabilities, including OCR and spatial reasoning in MMVet (Yu et al., 2024), and multiple-choice probing in 12 dimensions in SeedBench (Li et al., 2023b). Broader frameworks such as MM-Bench (Liu et al., 2024b), TouchStone (Bai et al., 2023), OmniBench (Li et al., 2024b), and MMStar (Chen et al., 2024) aim for holistic multimodal evaluation by covering wide array of tasks and domain-specific knowledge. MMMU (Yue et al., 2024) pushes toward expert-level multimodal reasoning. As performance on most of these benchmarks seems to saturate, more carefully designed benchmarks (Wu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Thrush et al., 2022; Hsieh et al., 2023) reveal persistent weaknesses in multiple dimensions, highlighting discrepancy between many seemingly positive benchmark results and actual visual capabilities. While these efforts nonetheless provide valuable insights, most emphasize global understanding, very broad task coverage, or require domain-specific expertise, while often overlooking basic perception in more challenging settings, such as visually overloaded scenes. Recently, multiple benchmarks started the exploration of small details in high-resolution scenes (Wu & Xie, 2024; Li et al., 2023a; Shi et al., 2025), showing another hurdle in the development of vision models. Our work complements these benchmarks with VisualOverload, human-annotated dataset of VQA pairs grounded in high-resolution, densely populated artworks. key differentiator of high-resolution benchmarks is that VisualOverload aims at exploiting the full complexity of the scene, while previous works mostly model needle-in-the-haystack-style retrieval of small details. By focusing on six basic tasks in overloaded scenes, VisualOverload reveals systematic error modes in state-of-the-art open and proprietary VLMs, highlighting critical gaps in knowledge-free visual understanding."

            "content": "In this work, we introduced VisualOverload, novel VQA benchmark designed to expose the limitations of state-of-the-art VLMs in complex, detail-rich scenes. Our findings demonstrate that while these models perform well on global tasks, they consistently struggle with simple, fine-grained questions within visually overloaded environments. This performance gap highlights critical area for future research, suggesting that the problem of fundamental visual understanding is far from solved. Ultimately, our dataset offers crucial resource for the community to develop more robust and perceptive VLMs. 9 Published as conference paper at ICLR"

We distribute VisualOverload at resolution that matches the pixels of 4K (with few outliers). Additionally, we downsampled images to match the number of pixels of VGA (640 480 pixels), HD (1280 720 pixels), FHD (1920 1080 pixels), QHD (2560 1440 pixels), and measured task-level performances on various instances of InternVL3 models in comparison to our original resolution. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Generally, performance improves with resolution, but at minor rate. However, it is visible that improvements are differently correlated with tasks. Text (especially small one) is poorly compressible, and it is, thus, unsurprising to see strong correlation between resolution and OCR performance. The opposite is modeled by scene recognition, which, for the most part, is solvable by global features that should be detectable even at extreme compression. This is backed by the lack of significant performance deviation throughout our tested resolutions. For the other tasks, we typically see an increase in performance with resolution, which seems to plateau after Full HD resolution. This is likely not shortcoming of our benchmark, but rather attributed to the models architecture. By default, InternVL3 splits the input image into at most 12 patches (each 448 448 pixels) plus thumbnail (Zhu et al., 2025). Thus, the model only supports resolution slightly above FHD without downsampling. While it is possible to increase the number of patches, this significantly increases the inference time and memory. For instance, even for InternVL3-8B, increasing the number of 15 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2026 patches from 12 to 40, which should be sufficient to process VisualOverload without downsampling, requires 8 40 GB GPUs, instead of just one, making such an experiment impossible for us. In theory, we, however, expect model performance to scale with resolution, assuming no downsampling. Consequently, we also expect higher performance using more patches (assuming sufficient context window and proper training).
