It is crucial that the avatar can be seamlessly controlled using audio signals, enabling intuitive and flexible manipulation of expressions, lip movements, and gestures to align with the desired content. Early attempts [3, 14, 30, 37, 44, 50] to tackle this task mainly resort to 3D intermediate representations, such as 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) [41] or FLAME [27]. However, these approaches typically face challenges in accurately capturing subtle expressions and realistic motions, which significantly limits the quality of the generated portrait animations. Recent research [4, 7, 21, 40, 46] has increasingly focused on creating talking head videos using diffusion models, which show great promise in generating visually compelling content that adheres to multi-modal conditions, such as reference images, text prompts, and audio signals. However, the realism of the generated videos remains unsatisfactory. Existing methods typically focus on tame talking head scenarios, achieving precise audio-aligned lip movements while neglecting other related motions, such as facial expressions and body movements, both of which are essential for producing smooth and coherent portrait animations. Moreover, the background and contextual objects usually remain static throughout the animation, which makes the scene less natural. In this work, we leverage pretrained video diffusion transformer models to generate highly realistic and visually coherent talking portraits. In essence, we propose multi-modal alignment framework built on the DiT-based video generation model to encourage unified dynamics across the whole scene, encompassing the reference portrait, associated contextual objects, and the background. Technically, we propose dual-stage audio-visual alignment strategy to facilitate portrait video generation. In the first stage, leveraging the powerful temporospatial modeling capabilities of the DiT-based model, we devise clip-level training to capture diverse implicit connections between the audio and visual dynamics across the entire clip. This enables an overall coherent generation of global motion. Lip movements are critical for enhancing the quality of the portrait video. However, the lip typically only occupies small region in frame, so it is challenging to precisely align lip movements with the audio signals on the entire frame. Therefore, in the second , , Mengchao Wang, Qiang Wang, Fan Jiang, Yaqi Fan, Yunpeng Zhang, Yonggang Qi, Kun Zhao, and Mu Xu Figure 1: Given portrait image, voice and text, FantasyTalking can generate animated portraits with rich expressions, natural body movements, and identity features.

Please refer to our supplementary materials for the video results. stage, we learn the attention of visual tokens mapped from audio tokens and employ mask that enforces the refinement of lip movements, ensuring they adhere more closely to the audio content at the frame level. Moreover, we avoid using the commonly adopted reference network for identity preservation. We found out that such an approach typically references the entire image and severely restricts the dynamic effects of the portrait. Instead, we reveal that cross-attention module focusing on facial modeling effectively ensures identity consistency throughout the video. Lastly, we introduce motion intensity conditioning module that decouples the characters expressions and body movements, thereby enabling the manipulation of motion intensity in the generated dynamic portrait. In summary, our contributions are as follows: aligned lip movements to further improve the quality of the generated video. Instead of adopting the conventional reference network for identity preservation, we streamline the process by devising facial-focused cross-attention module that concentrates on modeling facial regions and guides the video generation with consistent identity. We integrate motion intensity modulation module that explicitly controls facial expression and body motion intensity, enabling controllable manipulation of portrait movements beyond mere lip motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves new SOTA in terms of video quality, temporal consistency, and motion diversity. We devise dual-stage audio-visual alignment training strategy to adapt pretrained video generation model to first establish coherent global motions involving background and contextual objects other than the portrait itself, corresponding to input audio at clip level, then construct precisely"

As illustrated in Figure 3(a), the first training stage computes 3D full attention correlations across full-length audio-visual token sequences at the clip level, establishing global audiovisual dependencies while enabling holistic feature fusion. While this stage enables joint learning of both weakly audio-correlated non-verbal cues (e.g., eyebrow movements, shoulder motions) and strongly audio-synchronized lip dynamics, but the model struggles to learn precise lip movements. This is due to the fact that the lips occupy only small portion of the entire visual field, while the video sequence is highly correlated with the audio in each frame. Frame-Level Training. In the second training stage, as depicted in Figure 3(b), we focus exclusively on lip-centric motion refinement through frame-exact audio-visual alignment. We segment the audio and videos according to one-to-one mapping relationship, reshape the video tokens into the shape of 𝑓 (ℎ 𝑤) 𝑐 and the audio tokens into the shape of 𝑓 𝑙 𝑐, where 𝑐 represents the number of channels. Subsequently, we compute the 3D full attention between these tokens, ensuring that the visual features attend only to their corresponding audio features. Additionally, in order to focus the attention on the lip area, we leverage MediaPipe [29] to extract precise lip masks in pixel space, which are then projected into the latent space via trilinear interpolation, forming our lip-focused constraint mask 𝑀. The frame-level loss in Eq. 1 is thus reweighted as: 𝐿𝑐 = 𝑀 𝐿 (2) where denotes element-wise multiplication. However, exclusive reliance on lip-specific constraints risks over-regularization, suppressing natural head movements and background dynamics.

To validate the effectiveness of our DAVA method, we performed experiments using audio-visual alignment at clip level and only at frame level for training. The results, as presented in Table 4 and illustrated in Figure 8. Training with only clip-level alignment leads to significant decline in the Sync-C metric. This indicates that relying solely on clip-level alignment is insufficient to learn the precise correspondence between audio and lip movements. However, training with only frame-level alignment, while demonstrating strong lip-sync capabilities, noticeably limits the dynamic nature of facial expressions and subject movements. In contrast, our proposed DAVA method effectively combines the Figure 9: Ablation on Identity Preservation. advantages of both clip-level and frame-level alignments, which achieves precise audio-to-lip synchronization while enhancing the vividness of character animations and background dynamics. Ablation on Identity Preservation. The results presented in Table 4 underscore the importance of identity preservation in our model. Without identity preservation, IDC significantly decreases, which implies that the models ability to maintain the characters identity features is greatly reduced, leading to decline in video quality. As shown in Figure 9, the absence of identity preservation lead to artifacts and distortions in the facial features. In contrast, our proposed identity preservation method, which incorporates focused facial knowledge learning, enhances the models ability to maintain the characters identity while preserving lip synchronization and rich motion capabilities. This leads to improved identity retention and overall video quality. Ablation on Motion Intensity Modulation Network. Figure 10 illustrates the quantitative results of adjusting the motion intensity coefficient 𝜔𝑙 and 𝜔𝑏 on FVD and SD. When one parameter is varied, the other is fixed at neutral value of 0.5. As shown in Figure 10 (a), the results with natural motion intensity (𝜔𝑙 = 0.5, 𝜔𝑏 = 0.5) achieve the best FVD scores. This suggests that facial and body motion intensities that are either too high or too low tend to produce visual representations that deviate from realistic scenarios, which result in less authentic visual representations. Figure 10(b) demonstrates that as the 𝜔𝑙 or 𝜔𝑏 parameters increase, the subject dynamic score becomes significantly more pronounced. This highlights the effectiveness of our motion control mechanism, which provides users with tool for explicitly controlling the speaking motion intensity. Limitations and Future Works. Despite the significant progress achieved by our method, especially in the scenario of wild talking head video generation, due to the iterative sampling process required by the diffusion model during inference to achieve optimal results, the overall runtime can be relatively slow. Investigating acceleration strategies would facilitate its use in scenarios with FantasyTalking: Realistic Talking Portrait Generation via Coherent Motion Synthesis , , higher real-time requirements, such as live streaming and interactive real-time applications. Furthermore, investigating interactive portrait dialogue solutions with real-time feedback based on audiodriven talking head generation can broaden applications in realistic digital human avatar scenarios.

            "title": "6 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we introduce FantasyTalking, a novel audio-driven\nportrait animation technique. By employing a dual-stage audio-\nvisual alignment training process, our method effectively captures\nthe relationship between audio signals and lip movements, facial ex-\npressions, as well as body motions. To enhance identity consistency\nwithin the generated videos, we propose a facial-focused approach\nto retain facial features accurately. Additionally, a motion network\nis utilized to control the magnitude of facial expressions and body\nmovements, ensuring natural and varied animations. Both qualita-\ntive and quantitative experiments demonstrate that FantasyTalking\noutperforms existing SOTA methods in several key aspects, includ-\ning video quality, motion diversity, and identity consistency.",
